            "answer": "You see that, in Denmark, we ha -- for all the years when I was young, mixed government between the social democrats and a radical party. And, you must recall that, in the 30\u2122s, after the Black Wednesday in \u212229, Denmark had had very -- indeed, very bad economical conditions. A big part of our -- ou r export was agriculture, and the first -- everybody stopped in Britain, was our biggest market, that was agriculture products. So there was a really big unemployment in Denmark in the beginning of the 30\u2122s, and there was, even then, not any tension t -- revolution or to Communism, all this, because there was a social welfare in Denmark. A social welfare, which was backed up even by the more conservative parties, so there was uni -- unity about -- to give the people who was not so good off as we, a helping hand. And after \u212236, it turns a little bit, and in \u212238, just before the war, we had a reasonable good situa tion, and of course the social democrat got the credit for that, and that is okay. And, at the same time, a certain Mr. Hitler, made his number in -- in Germany. We thought that Hitler was a clown. We und-underestimated that guy. His screaming, his completely dire cted reviews. He -- When we saw him in the picture -- the pictures of him, when we -- wh en we heard him in -- in the radio, on -- on film, or this newsreels, it was -- w-we couldn\u2122t understa -- we really thought the man must be crazy. And that gave Denmark an in jection against narcissism, because that was also completely foolish for us to believe that anybody are supermen. I never forget, we as Danes, was so -- the best of all the Aryans, w ith our blue eyes, our blonde hair, and -- and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 9 all this. And we couldn\u2122t u-understand anything out of -- and therefore, in Denmark, there was a feeling of certainness, that that guy could never be a threat. That was \u212236 - \u212237.

But, the [indecipherable] was that when he had passed the bridge over Rhine, the river Rhine, and taking over the old German socketbeat without, and he was shooting at him.

And then they came b ack and they -- then went over Copenhagen, and we have heard about the bombardment of Wachau, in the year before, when the start of the war started, and afterwards, we got the -- the message that Hitler has threatened to bomb Copenhagen if we did not -- gave up and sign the treaty th at let -- he should take USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 10 over the power and -- and all this. And we had that time, 13,000 soldier, that was all, and somebody was killed at the -- at the border between Ge-Germany and Denmark.

And from the -- that day, I -- I despised the man, and the regime. But I think that goes for many, many, many. I was 13 years, that ni-nin th of April, and it was strange because I had to go to the station. I went to school in Copenhagen, that was a dri -- a drive of about an hour or so, and non -- in the train, I\u2122ve heard about it.

This -- To live, one day in a country with law and order, the next in a country where you do not know what is law and order, because the other set up what you have to be and say, that is difficult. All this -- For instance, with the news. From one day to another, we just had one side of the news.

As paper boys, we distributed -- and to me it was very clear.

You should have seen all the ante nnas you tried to make, in order to get the news from BBC, three times a day. And, again, BBC was the truthful news media.

That\u2122s easy to say when you are not sitting at the fir -- in the first row, but that was a very shameful feeling, that we have failed, that we now saw that England was very, very hard pressed, and there was none in Europe, who c ould help.

Because when we -- not we, but when the saboteurs got the order from England, this factory is dangerou s because they are making that. It is much better that we, in Denmarks, had people who set the -- the -- the bomb inside and blew it up. You see what happen when you have air attacks? We saved quite a lot of civil lives by sabotage, and it\u2122s much more precise. And the people who was working in the factories who were blown up, they were warned, and they came out. That means it was a human, much better way to be self-destructive, than to have the British and American aircrafts coming over and bombing. So, therefor e, i -- sabotage was a very serious attack on the German war machine, and that was, therefore, that the Germans, in \u212243, the 29th of August, where there have been quite a lot of sabotage before, that was railway, it means that the transportation between Germany and Norway, which normally went through the Danish headlines, they were disturbed, and then the -- the Germans demanded that there should be again, a general punishment for sabotage and for carrying weapon.

And the Danish government [indecipherable] Danish government resigned, but there was not appointed a ne -- new government, and the -- it m -- had the effect that the Danish administration continued, but the leader was not a political secretary, but the man who was chief of the office. And not elected, it was an administration, and that administration continued until the day of liberation, the fifth of May, 1945. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 16"

D-Do you think there is a genuine interest, or is it perhaps maybe just a kind of a fad, or how do you make sense of it?",
            "answer": "It\u2122s very difficult, because we have seen, after the war, many thing which goes near Holocaust. We see it today in Kosovo, we saw it at Rwanda some years ago. We see it in Sudan, Muslims again Christian, we see that in India. We see that in the former Soviet Union. I think that it\u2122s also the interest in -- in avoiding -- avoiding a new Holocaust. Therefore, I -- when I participate, many times, it i -- a part of an Holocaust education, and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0040 62 I really think that the Holocaust education maybe can give us some answers how to avoid it. I mean, education is one of the things, when you see round the world, people living next to each other in different countries, they believe the other country will do that and that and vice-a - versa. And they fear it, they don\u2122t know. The more we\u2122re able to know about our neighbor countries -- neighbor countries, it will help. I don\u2122t believe that we are able to make countries love each other, but could we, through education, make them hate a little less, we would had achieved quite a lot. But, I think it\u2122s so important, with the Holocaust education, and a part of the Holoca ust education is also \ufb01Schindler\u2122s List.\ufb02 Last year here, we watch a preview of a picture about the Danish rescue of the Jews, and it was not so special, truthful, but it was a good story, and -- but it gives the impression all the time, that we can do something. Not to avoid it, but to dimin-diminish the results of it. We -- We must do something, we must learn people to do what we, as Christian or Jews, are taught.
