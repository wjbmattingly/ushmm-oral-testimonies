It\u2019s July the eighth, 1999 and we are sitting in Dr. Pressman\u2019s home and office in Lexington, Kentucky, and this is Arwen Donahue conducting the interview. This is tape number one, side A. Let\u2019s begin then with, would you tell me something about your, well first of all, let\u2019s begin with where you were born and your date of birth.",
            "answer": "I was born in Paris, France, May 29, 1932. I did my school in France, my medical school, also. And I stay until the first World War and when the German came. And by the time probably I was around nine years old, and the Germans start to come in the school, but first it was the French police who came, just asking every teacher, \u201cDo you have any Jewish boy in the school?\u201d And she said or he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d So they ask, \u201cWho is Jewish, raise your hand.\u201d And I didn\u2019t raise my hand and when I did go back home, I said to my mother and father, well, this is what happened. And they sent me in a safe place in South of France."

Would you like to stay and live in France?\u201d But the question \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d was a little bit surprising for me. Why should people ask what kind of religion, mostly we knew it was the police. So, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable, so I said, I\u2019m going to wait a little bit and speak to my parent and ask them what they think."

And they try first to come in United State, but they didn\u2019t let them in United State, because my mother did have glaucoma. And they didn\u2019t know what was glaucoma at the time.

And the south was with the Italian and it was much easier there. It didn\u2019t stay long, but by the time the Italian were there, it was much easier than in north, where the Germans were much more rough with us."

And my two brother did follow the police with no resistance, because they, you know, the police said it is just to make a verification of your paper. And they didn\u2019t ask anything about my father, but he right away closed the whole thing. And we had been waiting about the answer, but my two brother never came back."

And also about fifteen miles from Paris, we did have a little villa, where we used to go on Saturday and Sunday and stay there. Life was very simple, happy, didn\u2019t have any major problem. They used to work during the week. I used to go to school. Saturday... Friday night, we load the car, we did go and stay outside of Paris. And everything was fine and dandy. So, life was normal, until the whole German story start and then everything change overnight."

So, he ask me one day, I remember, he said, \u201cDo you want to do your Bar Mitzvah?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d Okay, no Bar Mitzvah. And it was the end of the story. My brothers never did a Bar Mitzvah. He was really not very interested in, not only in the Jewish religion, but on any religion. This 1s, I think, the way Iam now. [Laughing]"

            "answer": "I think so. I think it was hard for her and this is why she asked us, the day she\u2019s going to die, she wants to be buried with the Jewish religion, which we did. At the time, I did have an office in south of France, close to Nice. And when she died, we made... the rabbi did the whole thing. We didn\u2019t understand anything about it, because it was the first Jewish funeral we did. But here she is in south of France, in a Jewish place, where she was buried like the Jewish religion."

            "answer": "In France? They came very, not in force. They came very, very slowly. The reason, I think, they got the whole thing so easy is because the French people are very anti-Semitic. So, for them 3 to give the address or to reveal where the Jew were living, it was not a problem. And I don\u2019t mean to say all of them, because a lot of police... we did have a neighbor, across from our apartment, who was from the police. And I even remember his name. His name was Mr. Reddler (ph). And every time something did happen, he came in our door, knock on the door and said, \u201cBe careful. They\u2019re going to do this, they\u2019re going to do this.\u201d So, I don\u2019t mean to say all the Frenchmen, but I said at least the majority of the French people were anti-Semitic."

Yes, you couldn\u2019t do otherwise than to realize, okay, we are not welcome in our own country. When I say our own country, I\u2019m born in France, so I thought I was a Frenchman, which was a big mistake, because no. I was a Jew. It\u2019s a little bit the same problem and I don\u2019t want to start any..."

I don\u2019t say to people, I am a French-American. I\u2019m an American, because I asked to become an American. If I would call myself French-American, it would mean to say, I\u2019m very happy to be French and I\u2019m also happy to be an American. And I think in life, you have to make a choice, either you are an American or you\u2019re French. And if it wouldn\u2019t be... I say this the other day to a black guy. He was very surprised. And coming from me, I think it was not a big problem. But I said, \u201cI think you\u2019re very lucky, your grand-grandparent was brought in United State. At least now you can drive a car. You can have a nice home, instead of being in Africa where you\u2019d be starving. You wouldn\u2019t have any clothes to put on your back and anybody can kill you. And this for me is racism. Here racism 1s not this. They are not racist, so I don\u2019t understand why you call yourself African-American. You are American from two, three or four generations. And it\u2019s not because your parents were slave.\u201d And when you know the story about the slave, it\u2019s not the American who took the black people. It\u2019s the chief of the village, who give black people to the American. So..."

You have a different way of speaking.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know, I, as a Jewish person cannot be a racist. So, if I tell you this, it\u2019s because coming from another country, I\u2019m surprised the way you deal with your slave story. You feel sorry for yourself, but you\u2019re so lucky to be in a country where you have freedom and you can live like any other person. You\u2019re Black? Sure it\u2019s, you can see a black man, but sometimes you can recognize a Jewish boy and so it\u2019s nothing worse to be Black or to be Jew, but I don\u2019t want to fight the country for this.\u201d"

And you can find people, different idea of people, different approach of life and so I think, yes, it can be a lot of, some Jewish people can be racist. It doesn\u2019t make a... but before we have to define: what do they mean by being racist?"

You don\u2019t like people the way they live, this can be racism. But basically, it\u2019s not racism, it\u2019s something, because you don\u2019t like their way of laughing. Black people are very exuberant and maybe some American don\u2019t like this and this can be a form of racism. And like I said before, Jewish people living in America are much more American than they are Jewish. And because of this, they can be racist."

            "question": "I don\u2019t understand that last. Because they\u2019re Jewish people living in America, they can be racist.",
            "answer": "Because they feel very safe in this country. And like I told you before, Jewish people are Jewish by tradition, but they belong to a minority. And if you are in France or in United State or any country in the world, you still are minority. But it is so comfortable in United State, then Jewish people forget the background and say, \u201cBut I\u2019m an American.\u201d And I say, \u201cNo, first you are Jew, and if anybody is going to kill you, they\u2019re going to kill you, just because you are Jew, not because you\u2019re an American.\u201d And this is the big problem and they lose the identity of being Jewish, just because they feel so comfortable. They feel, /t\u2019s my country. Yes it is, in one way. But until, and you can see this on TV, this young man, who been speaking about racism against black, Jew, all the Jew have the power in the bank. It\u2019s not true, but in his mind it is. And he killed people and he killed himself. You saw this on TV two or three days ago. This is the big problem."

            "answer": "At the time I didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, because I was, I did a big selection. I\u2019m not the kind of man who have a lot of friends. And yes, at the time all my friends, at the time were Jewish. The reason 1s, I feel more comfortable with Jewish people than with non-Jewish people. And again, I don\u2019t speak about religion. I speak about tradition. Going to a Jewish restaurant once in a while, it\u2019s fun and it remind me memory. Watching a movie with Jewish song, it\u2019s fun. I\u2019ve been married twice with non-Jewish woman and I was missing this exchange of jokes, Jewish jokes or word. Even in New York, when I go to New York, people speak a lot of Jewish word and it\u2019s always funny. And I always say, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d \u201cNo, but we use a lot of Jewish word here 5 in New York,\u201d but they are not Jewish. But it\u2019s funny, I like it, because it\u2019s something... So when I was in France, I didn\u2019t want to have non-Jewish friend because I would never know if the same guy 1s not going to give me a knife when the time comes."

The only reason I left France to come in the United State, I decided to come here in 1983, is because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable in France. Because up to this date, you have this anti-Semitism in France. My brother, who is seventy-six or seventy-eight, doesn\u2019t feel it. He said, \u201cNo, this is in your mind.\u201d And he is married with a non-Jew woman. She 1s wonderful woman, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable. I... France is a beautiful country.

But my grandson, which is the son of my daughter, and my daughter doesn\u2019t follow the religion. But my grandson studied the Jewish story, I mean the difference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi and he said, \u201cBut sometime they are racist between...\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I know.\u201d I think if you put two men with no religion on an island, there\u2019s going to be racism, because man is stupid. They want to fight. They want to fight for a reason. The reason is religion. And they are going to fight about God, it\u2019s my God, it\u2019s not your God. God is God. Your God is my God.

            "answer": "It was March in 1942, when they did go to Auschwitz. Before it was a camp a little bit outside of Paris called Drancy, where all the Jewish people been put together for a length of time, I think it was between eight and ten month. Where they start to shape the whole thing: \u201cAre we going to send them? What kind of train are we going to use?\u201d It was another camp not far from there, called Compiegne, which was also the same kind. So... there is a man, who came here in Lexington, a Jewish man, who gave something... I\u2019ve got something, I will remember his name. And he explained what the German did have in mind. And it\u2019s amazing the way they did organize the whole thing. Even it was a lot of Jewish people, put together in a train, they didn\u2019t know nothing, from where they come, what they going to do, where they going to go. 6 Everything was real on paper. The train company didn\u2019t know what they were going to transport, because it was special train for animals. So, it was so well organized, and they prepared all this and from each country it was the same thing. From Poland it was another way. From Yugoslavia it was another way. From Austria it was another way. It was really a technique they did have. And the top of those guys, I\u2019m afraid to say he was a brain, because he was crazy. But his name was Himmler, and he organized the whole thing. And he organized this very well. And you know, the Jewish people who\u2019ve been in camp, most of them were, what we call here blue-collar, simple people. They didn\u2019t think we\u2019re going to kill them. Even until they arrive in the camp, when they say, the SS was on, say, one side, \u201cYou go this way, you go this way.\u201d No, it was nothing. The only time my brother realized he was in a bad direction 1s when one time, coming down from the train, he didn\u2019t go fast enough. The SS slapped his face. And he was nineteen years old. Then he realized something is going to happen, now it\u2019s another world. But until then, well 1t was hard, they didn\u2019t have anything to eat in the train. They didn\u2019t have any water. They didn\u2019t have any... but it\u2019s going to clear up, no problem. They didn\u2019t realize they go to the butcher. They go to die, by thousands. And this was the life. They did go, because the only one who realize what\u2019s going on were the educated people, the attorney, the doctor, the people who did study. But they were not many people. When my brother was deported in Auschwitz, it was a guy with him, who was, I think he was a colonel in the French army. And he said, \u201cThey are going to do nothing to me. I\u2019m a colonel from the French army.\u201d He died like all the one, just because he was Jew. That\u2019s all. They didn\u2019t care he was a colonel. He did have a high education. Doesn\u2019t make any difference. You are Jew, you must die. It\u2019s amazing, eh? But..."

            "answer": "Yes, we did have the possibility to go around the camp, Private Honor (ph) from Haus (ph) let us in and we could communicate by sign. So we can see they are alive, because in Drancy they didn\u2019t kill anybody. They been starving. They even allowed to receive some package of food. But like I said, 1t was not a long time, but communicate mouth to mouth? No, it was impossible. No German in Drancy just the French military and the police. No SS, no German, the whole camp was under the surveillance of the French police."

She spoke mostly the language, but she didn\u2019t speak the... but 1t was, it was something. You have to remember my parent left Russia because of the Bolshevism. My parent were three hundred percent for the idea of communism. So, they were with one track mind. So politically, even if I could remember, I don\u2019t think it would be accurate, because they were too much in one way. I couldn\u2019t have any discussion. Even my brother, who is alive now, I can, 7 ) some conversation about politic I cannot have with him, because he is still in one track. Very hard to discuss about politic. And again, like I said before, France is his country. It\u2019s the best place, why should I go in America? End of Tape 1, Side A 8 Tape 1, Side B"

            "answer": "No, they, my parent, neither my mother, neither my father, didn\u2019t discuss with the children. We\u2019d been raised with a lot of authority from my folks. And they say, \u201cThis is an emergency; we have to go.\u201d So my father is going to go there. We are going to go there. And we\u2019ll see how it is going to be. And we\u2019ll decide day by day, because it was no other way. We have to leave everything. Everything we got lost. We left with too little luggage and that\u2019s it, because we knew we never going to see anything we left. Because it was the end. We try to save our life, that\u2019s all. So another time for me and like my two other brother were in Drancy, so it was only another brother and me, so it was a little bit easier. So, my father left with my other brother, Gaston, and I stay with my mother. And at the time it was, Paris became very, very difficult. No place to hide, so my mother send me through the Zone. It was a line between the North and South and you have to pass the Zone. And some French people for money, they direct you between the army. And I did go in South in Grenoble. And when I arrive in Grenoble, a friend of my mother took me and three days later she came down. And we stay... and I don\u2019t remember how long, maybe couple months, three months. And it became very dangerous to stay there. So, she send me to my father. And where my father was, was more dangerous than there, so they decide... I came back to see my mother and my mother, remember I was nine years old. So, they decide to send me to Switzerland with a group of Jewish people, boys. And I think I was the oldest one from all the boys. We were about fourteen, fifteen. So, we did go in one little town, just to the frontier, slept there until midnight, one o\u2019clock in the morning. Then two men took us, make us walk and we arrive on the border. The Swiss took us and put us in a refugee camp."

We did have a yellow star, the Jewish star, with inside \u201cJew\u201d and you have to carry this in anything you wear. So, you did have two way, either you don\u2019t carry this thing and if they catch you, they kill you right there, or if you 9 have one, everybody can see you. And this was only in the north of France, in Paris. So this is why my mother decided to let us go down in south, because it was, I remember when they start to give us this yellow badge to carry. In the street I used to live, it was a man, who was very old, maybe eighty-five, ninety and he was blind, Jewish. And he carried this yellow thing and I thought to myself, this is terrible, because if you can treat a human being, because of religion, it\u2019s really the end. And this 1s, I think where my mother decided to send me, because, you know, it\u2019s so easy. It\u2019s very hard to explain how does it look. How do you realize a park, like here, Rupp Arena, downtown, with all the door closed, only one open and you push all the Jew inside. And it was, I don\u2019t know, maybe five hundred thousand, six hundred thousand. I don\u2019t know... all there. And from there, they start to spread group. And this was the beginning of the end. So, it was time to do something, leave, hide and this is where I think they organized this, my mother and my father."

And I said, \u201cNo, no, I would like to go now.\u201d So, he was a little bit reluctant to let me go, but he let me go. And I did go to Grenoble, from Switzerland to Grenoble where my mother used to live. And I didn\u2019t 16 find her. So, I did go to, there was a Jewish association in Grenoble, so I did go there. And they said they knew about my mother. They said, \u201cNo, she did go back to Paris and her sister apartment, because her apartment was with people, with your brother, Gaston.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can I go?\u201d And they asked me, \u201cDo you have money? We\u2019ll buy you a ticket.\u201d They bought me a ticket, train again. And I did go to Paris. And when I did go to the train in Grenoble, I met a young soldier, French soldier and I did the whole travel with him. He took care of me. And before we left, this lady from the Jewish association sent a wire to my mother and when I arrive in the train station in Paris, my mother and Gaston were there waiting for me. And we did go see, we did go to the apartment of her sister, who die in Auschwitz and it was nobody in the apartment. It was a very small apartment and oh, maybe... time for me is very hard... maybe two months later or three months later, the Jewish people from the camp, from Auschwitz, Dachau, Buchenwald, all those places, start to come back in Paris. And it was a big hotel, called Hotel Lutecia (ph) prepare for clean them, to ask paper, if they got anything, you know. And Hotel Lutecia call us and say we have one Pressman. So, we did go there right away and it was Bernard. But we couldn\u2019t see him. We didn\u2019t know where he was. So, we wait, go, ask, couldn\u2019t find him. The next day... so, we did go home at this apartment and the next day we receive a man, who said, \u201cYour son did go to the old apartment,\u201d who was let\u2019s say like, five blocks from where we were. So, we did go by foot, walking and here, is coming, my brother. This is where we find out my other brother was dead. He was killed in Auschwitz. And Bernard was alive. Then we did go to the apartment of my aunt, sister of my mother, and life started to re-organize. We want to recuperate the fabric of my father. Everything was gone, but at least the wall was there and my brother decided to\u2014because he was trained by my father\u2014to open the place. And with my mother, they start to re-open the place and I started to go to college, to school, to school first. And after I decided to go to college. And it was a little fight, family fight, because they want me to be an upholsterer like my father and I said no, I want to study medicine. Everybody said, \u201cBut we cannot help you,\u201d and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t ask for help. I will work myself.\u201d I found a little room and I was working, doing a lot of things and studying medicine. After this, I became the doctor of the family. [Laughing]"

Because I speak always about him. His name was Charles, but his wife was something great. I mean, she was a teacher in school for children, but she was a very, very strong person. And when they accept me, I receive a tag around my neck. They put me again in another train from Geneva to, it\u2019s a little town where they used to live, Rances. Very small town. He was the pastor of the town. And they came and picked me up. I didn\u2019t know where I was. Mine parrain, my godfather was very, very cheerful, very big open mind, very smart man. They were a very nice couple, but they never could have any children. So, mine godfather was priest, so he said, \u201cYou going to go to the synagogue.\u201d And I said, \u201cI never been to a synagogue and I don\u2019t want to go to a synagogue.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re Jewish, you\u2019re going to go to the synagogue.\u201d So, every week I did have to go and it was far away, because there was no synagogue where he was. So, I did have to take the bus and I didn\u2019t like it all. But he said, \u201cNo, you have a wonderful religion, you have to keep with it. Okay. And I don\u2019t want for you, unless you feel, but you don\u2019t have no obligation to come in my 17 church. If you want to come, no problem, but I don\u2019t want you...\u201d And I said, \u201cCan I ring the bell?\u201d And he said, \u201cIf you want to, Sunday morning you can ring the bell.\u201d So, I ring the bell and he introduce me in a Sunday, when I was at his place. The second Sunday he introduce me to all the congregation. Swiss people are very, very nice people. And they treat me like the son of the house. They give me aroom. I remember they did have a German Shepherd, who was trained. He was in the same time\u2014I don\u2019t know how you call this\u2014a priest who take care of prison people. And he used to go with his dog, in case one of the prisoner did go away, the dog is going to be able... He was a very, very funny man, very smart, very funny man. And I help as much as I could. I carry the milk, because they did have a lot of cow. So, I work outside of the school for three, four hour every day, carrying the milk from the cow to the company where they make the cheese. And it was really, a family. They want me to learn how to play piano. They did have a piano. And since I have my own piano and I play because of them. He always, he make me feel something I never felt before: the importance of knowledge. And this is when I start to read, this is when I start to write. I spend with them less than one year, but I think the foundation of my life was based on this time I spend with them, because they were so good and so hard. They were not... they were sweet, but they let me pass nothing. I did have my job to do and I better do it, otherwise... And it became normal with me and really I spend... I learn how to love nature.

What is the reason of life? We don\u2019t know. But I think everything is written, you in your life, another one in another life, everything is written. I say since a long time, we all have a ticket in the pocket. 18 You have the date of birth and there is no date where you\u2019re going to go, to be gone, but really there is one, but you don\u2019t know it. And it\u2019s funny, because I say to a lot of my patients, we celebrate birth of people, but we don\u2019t celebrate death and death is something of life. It\u2019s the end of life. If you did have a bad life, you\u2019re going to have a bad time to re-incarnate in a good life. But if you look your life and you said yes, I did have bad time like everybody else, but the good time were good. And when I remember all this, all the good time, it was wonderful. It\u2019s experience. And in life, you cannot have all the time, good time. And on top of this, I say this too, some of my good patient with whom I have a good exchange, money is important, but compared to destiny, money is nothing. Destiny is what is going to make you what you are. You are going to be able to enjoy anything: a fruit, a good meal, good company. And when I say good company, feeling you are with somebody, friends, and you are on the same level. You can exchange... if you say something a little bit different, people are not going to laugh. They are going to say either \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d or they\u2019re going to say, \u201cI know what you mean. I feel it, what you feel.\u201d And this is the purpose of life, but it\u2019s not every day you find things like this and it\u2019s not every day you are in tune with things. But when you are, it\u2019s wonderful and the rest, well, you have to do with. You receive a bad bill, you have a bad problem, you have a flat tire in the middle of nowhere... it\u2019s tough, but you have to deal with it. You say, okay, I will remember next time I\u2019m going to have a good time, this flat tire. It was bad, but in exchange look what good time I got now. And I think it\u2019s a good philosophy."

You know, Jewish people accept Jewish jokes from another Jew, but if another one does the jokes, they don\u2019t like it. Did the Jewish people deserve what happened? I don\u2019t think so. Nobody deserve to suffer this way, but in the whole world, in the whole idea of human people, is it something who 1s going to serve humanity? I think so. I think so. How many people, who were in Auschwitz, in all those camps, are going to be able to use it? Minority. But the one who are going to be able to do it are going to bring something and we don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to put this. On the newborn? There is a new book, written by a Rabbi, and people don\u2019t like him very much, because he write, he wrote this book about reincarnation. And he said a lot of people call him, write to him and they say, \u201cI\u2019m born in a Catholic family. I\u2019m Catholic. I go to the church every Sunday. I believe on Jesus Christ and I believe in God, but inside of me I got this Jewish feeling and I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d And it\u2019s uh, how can I say, it\u2019s surprising. And from what he say, he thinks they were in the Holocaust and they reincarnate in another corps, but they got this knowledge and they want to explain this. Long time ago, maybe not so long, but twenty years ago, you never spoke about reincarnation. A lot of people knew about, but they don\u2019t want to say anything, because they say, \u201cWell, they going to think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d Now it is more open. Sometime when I feel people react and it\u2019s a small group... I give a lot of lecture on acupuncture, and acupuncture related to the human body and the illness of some people. And I go a little bit further and reincarnation and a lot of people react and say, \u201cI felt this. I felt I was in another life. I cannot pinpoint, but I know this is not my first life.\u201d So, I think, coming back to the idea of the Holocaust, it served a purpose, which one, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m sure it serve a purpose. If you say this to my brother, he\u2019s going to laugh for three hour, but it\u2019s okay. And I 19 mean, it\u2019s his problem, it\u2019s not mine. I don\u2019t bring any proof, but I know there is a purpose. Can it be another Holocaust? Yes. The same one we saw? No. It\u2019s going to be something completely different, but Hell is here on earth, so anything can happen. Anything."

Germany need somebody like Hitler and if it was Hitler or George or anybody else, it would be the same thing. We speak about the devil.

When you see a movie and you know it\u2019s fiction, if you see it or you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not a problem. But when things happen... I have a movie from the camp. This camp was liberated by the English army and the English are very tough. They show, they took the whole, bigger than a village, I think it was about fifteen, twenty thousand people. And they opened where they put all the dead, the cadaver, the Jewish people who they killed, they opened this with a special machine and they forced every people living in the town to carry a dead body and put it on the truck to give them a decent burial. Don\u2019t you think they are going to remember? Yes, they will. Because when you touch with your hand, a dead body, you remember for the rest of your life. And if we could make people touch people or nothing else, force the youth to go to a hospital here, in Lexington, Louisville, anyplace, once an hour, every week and just walk and see people suffering, they are going to be a little bit different. American youth think they are indestructible, you know? They got the power. They can do anything until they die. This is why you have so many people who cripple themselves. They jump from, with a cord around their feet, you know... \u201cI\u2019m the best,\u201d you know, the guy who jump with the motorcycle in Colorado. Okay, if the guy survive, it\u2019s okay, if he die, everybody should see it, because life is not a joke. Life is a gift. You can use it badly and you can use it intelligently, but just by jumping and so you see... it\u2019s like the guy who jumped from the Eiffel Tower and he say, \u201cNothing can happen to me.\u201d And you know, he fall down and every stage, he say, \u201cYou see, nothing happened to me,\u201d until he reach the downstairs and then that\u2019s it. You don\u2019t... gravity is like life, you don\u2019t play game with life. Take a knife, stick 1t in your stomach and you\u2019ll see what happen. And everybody should know about the Holocaust just as a reminder. Justice in this country 1s too lenient. Yesterday they liberate a man, who did abuse children. He got ten year and after five year, they let him go. He\u2019s going to do it again. What should we do? This is another discussion, but don\u2019t let him loose, because he\u2019s going to take care... he\u2019s going to take another innocent child. This man is sick. We have to do something about this. But don\u2019t say, \u201cWell, you know, what can we 22 do?\u201d What do you mean, what can we do? Let\u2019s us do the best we can, but do something. Don\u2019t let a man wild with normal people."

Never been real brother. Why, I don\u2019t know. But my mother, when I was very young, I used to discuss with her, as long as she did have the power on me, it was okay. But when I grew up and because of the separation of this, my attitude changed. And my mother is a very, used to be a very strong personality. She wants to organize everything. Example, when I came to study chiropractic in the United States... I was married at the time and my daughter was eighteen months old. And she didn\u2019t understand why I took my daughter with me instead of leaving my daughter with her for two year. And I said, I don\u2019t know how you can think about me leaving my daughter for two year, eighteen month? I\u2019m never going to be her father anymore. So, we did have a very, very big discussion about this and for the time I was gone, she never spoke to me. And my brother, Bernard, reunite us when I came back. But the problem 1s, I was at the time, as stubborn as she was. And we were always on challenge. I like her, I would do anything for her, but I couldn\u2019t receive any order from her. And it\u2019s a feeling very hard to explain, because like when I open my office... she came in. She wants to organize my office. And I said, \u201cMother, it\u2019s my office, it\u2019s my place and 27 I\u2019m going to organize it my way. You like it, you come. You don\u2019t like it, 1t\u2019s too bad.\u201d But until the end, she wants to be the boss. [Laughing.] And she never could, because probably we were the same way, you know? But so the relation was not, I saw my mother, jump on her, kiss her? No. And my mother was not a kisser. One kiss a week was the top, no more. So she stay in her, in her back, and I stay, and my other brother, Gaston, is... 1t was, is and was a very funny character. He looks good and it was enough for him. So, he was thinking more to buy nice suit, nice thing. And when I came back he was a growing man and you know, he didn\u2019t want to bother with me. I was the little boy. So, the relation was short.

So, knowing this, after this, knowing she was carrying a gun, didn\u2019t surprise me."

            "question": "The reason that I noticed it and that I asked you about it, one reason was that the gun, the issue of your experiences with a gun came up a couple of times during the interview yesterday. You talked about the one time that, or not yesterday but earlier, you talked about the one time Pastor Lederman got angry at you was when he saw you playing with his gun. And then you talked about that other incident with your mother. And then you mentioned also that you feel safer if you have a gun now. And that was something you didn\u2019t talk about on tape. And I was wondering if you would talk about that?",
            "answer": "Well, it took me a long time before I could train myself. I have now thirty year of martial art behind me. I always felt in general, the Jewish people don\u2019t like gun, don\u2019t like to fight. I mean I speak about the Jewish people in France. And it was a discovery for, I think, every Jewish people in the world when we found out Israelian soldier were one of the best in the world. And I was not surprised, I was happy about, but generally, even up to this date, when you speak gun with Jewish people they don\u2019t like it. Jewish people in general are not fighter, unless you go in Israel and they did what they did. And this is why I always felt very secure, and when I was with my godfather in Switzerland, I did like to have this gun close to me. But it was very hard for me to explain to him why. I always felt like if anything happened, maybe I\u2019m going to die, but I\u2019m 29 going to defend myself. I don\u2019t want to die like a poor animal. I want to die, but before I\u2019m going to die, somebody else is going to die, too. It was my feeling since a long time. I was in very big contradiction with my brothers, but something I have to say... even I knew my father very little, my father used to carry all the time a gun. I didn\u2019t know why and I couldn\u2019t ask the question, because I don\u2019t think he would answer, but this is something I remember. And maybe it\u2019s because of this I always... But basically in my mind I think the reason I always like gun is because gun, you can defend yourself, without a gun, you dead."

From where we come... it\u2019s funny because we were four, five brother and we were so different. The only one I know the best is the one who stay alive now. And he is so different, like I said in the tape before and he\u2019s not a fighter. He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s not a fighter, and the only reason he came back is because he was lucky. And you can... you know, in front of so many SS or Nazi in the camp, you don\u2019t have a... 1f they decide to kill you, they will kill you anytime they want. So when he came back, he came back because he was lucky. But my brother was not a fighter and I am a fighter. Like I told him many time, if I was in a camp, if they took me in Auschwitz, I wouldn\u2019t survive an hour. They would kill me right away.

And I said, I never join synagogue in France, why should I join a synagogue here on top of this? This for me is not a synagogue. This is ajoke. You know, Saturdays is the Shabbat. Saturday Jewish people don\u2019t touch money, so we hire Catholic people to play the music, to clean the place, because we cannot work, because we cannot sing, it\u2019s against the law of the Jewish Torah.

And when I graduate from college, my brother wants for me to go and work with him on the .

What... so, my brother, like I said, is a nice man, tried to help me as much as he could. And he helped me, but basically the whole family, cut a little bit between them and I, because what I would like to do, it was silly. For them it didn\u2019t make any sense. The only time they realize it was true, is when I graduate from medical school. And they said, \u201cWell, he did it, with no help.\u201d I was working at night, and I was doing a lot of job. And during the day I did go to medical school. And when I graduate, everybody was very happy and we celebrate. And meantime before I graduate, I got married with a Catholic girl, not Jewish. This didn\u2019t help mine relation with my family. I got a little girl at the time and I was twenty-three years old. And I raised my little girl. I did have, like I said, a lot of job, but I was making a good living. And when it was, I think it was, I practice for about three, four year in Paris and I decide I want to learn about the mechanic of the body. And this is where I came and find out about United State and Harvard, it was a special course for the mechanic of the body. And I came by myself for two or three weeks. And this is where I found out, somebody told me about chiropractic. So, I did go to Davenport, Iowa, where I saw what was chiropractic. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t have any idea. And the first time I saw about chiropractic, I said \u201cThose people are crazy. Doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d you know, the spine, give an adjustment. And before I left they give me a book, which I have even up to this day. And I did go back to France, read the book and I said, \u201cGosh, this makes sense to me.\u201d So, I pack up all my thing, took my wife and daughter and came to the United State and did go to Davenport, Iowa, where they give me credit. And I study chiropractic, graduate in 1962. And came back to France in Paris and opened an office in Paris. And I start to practice medicine and chiropractic."

Right now, every night you cry, you scream, because you are in the camp now. If you forgive, let them worry about their problem, but get rid of it.\u201d What did I say? So, he send me, even two weeks ago he send me a book I couldn\u2019t find here. And it is in French. I like to read in French. And on the side he wrote, \u201cTry to understand why I cannot forgive.\u201d We have two different way of thinking and until the last minute of his life he is going to cry and be mad, but he doesn\u2019t want to.

            "answer": "When I was in France, on my spare time when I was a student of medicine, I learn hypnosis. I was very interested in hypnosis. I put a lady through surgery under hypnosis. And you have a lot of technique. And mainly this technique of forgiveness, which I didn\u2019t know before and I was very happy to learn and practice this first on me. Every time I was mad at somebody or things I didn\u2019t like, I did try to forgive the people I was speaking, I mean not openly, but in my mind. And this way it was easy for me to be able to discuss with people. Some people have a natural way of being patient. I\u2019m not patient, so I did want to find something who is not going to make me patient, but make me a normal human being. And those technique of forgiveness 1s so... we hear this in the Catholic religion. Forgive and God will forgive you. I always say to a lot of people, I don\u2019t need any church because if I have a problem, I speak with God directly. It is fifty percent joke and fifty percent true, it goes together. Because another human being like me, ah, how intelligent he can be? What can he do with God, I cannot do directly if I want to do it? And this forgiveness came back to me. And one day I was in a course of hypnosis and the teacher said, \u201cToday we\u2019re going to speak only about forgiveness.\u201d And I thought, God, this is great, and I learned every bit of it. And I practice this with me and with my patient. And it was wonderful, because people used to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t think this way before, but now it make it so easy.\u201d And I thought to myself, I know, because I practice the same way for myself. The more I can forgive things, easy my life is, and I come back always to the point zero. If you let, 1f you do a mistake and you go too far with this mistake, it\u2019s very... longer you keep with, harder it is to come back. So, try to rectify the mistake as soon as you can, so this way it\u2019s going to be much easier to work on it and it\u2019s going to be quicker. So they teach you every time at night before you, when you go to bed, before you go to sleep, try to go very fast on your day and say, \u201cOkay what happened today? What did I do that was not good?\u201d So you try to forget yourself by being sorry and said \u201cI\u2019m not going to do this any more. I\u2019m going to try to be better,\u201d and also vice and versa, one way or another way. It\u2019s amazing the way it works. It\u2019s something very simple. The only thing is, if you are willing to do it, it\u2019s perfect. If you don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s very hard. And this is why, I try. I stay about two weeks with my brother. I said, \u201cBernard, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re going to be mad, if you want to throw me out from your house, you do it. But every day I\u2019m going to speak to you about forgiveness, because this is your only savior.\u201d But he laugh, he became red sometime, he left the room, he took witness, friend. Okay, he took friend who thought like him. And you know, if you ask a friend, after all the story of the camp, he survive and he say, \u201cBloing (ph), face to face, can I forgive this?\u201d People say, \u201cNo.\u201d But this is not what I ask him. I don\u2019t ask him to forgive this way. I want for him to forgive them their fault, they are the worst people. He is not a bad man. So forgive them for what they did to them and to you. But it was... I don\u2019t think... maybe I put a little something on the ground, but for him it is too late. And I think, it\u2019s not nice what I\u2019m going to say, but I think also he enjoy a little bit his situation."

You know, when you say something, it\u2019s very hard to retract. When they arrive in Auschwitz, I don\u2019t remember the date, but they shave every man and woman. And they put them in a big room. And it was not very light, it was very dark. And one moment he was walking and he turn around and he sees this guy on his back all the time. And he say, \u201cWhy do you follow me all the time like this?\u201d And he said, \u201cBut I\u2019m Maurice, I\u2019m your brother.\u201d He didn\u2019t recognize him. He was... and for me, my interpretation is, he was already gone. He put a wall. Not because... because the situation. He said, \u201cOkay, save your life.

But when you judge human being to do experience like rat, there is no end. I don\u2019t know why he said this and what is the basic idea. Maybe one day I am going to have the chance to speak with him. But what did he mean by this? In Germany, Der Spiegel did an article of a doctor, who was a doctor in the camp Auschwitz. He\u2019s alive now. They made an interview and they asked the question, \u201cDo you feel guilty about what you did?\u201d Because they did horrible experience. And he said, \u201cNo, I did my job.\u201d And people said, \u201cWhat do you mean by your job?\u201d He said, \u201cI was military. They put me in a camp, but I save a lot of Jew. I kill a lot, but I save a lot. And everything we did, helped for this generation.\u201d So, the question is, is he guilty? Is he not guilty? He sleeps every day. He doesn\u2019t have any problem.

Sometime you don\u2019t know what drives you, why you want to do something and this is when I say God is so strong. Because sometimes God say, he wants to be a garbage driver, let it be. And he open every door he can. And the guy is very happy. We need people drive truck, drive garbage truck. We need fire people. We need policemen. So, why not? The funny part is, every time I... I used to take anybody who wants to have hypnosis, they want to know what they were in another life. Because everybody think they were king, queen, princess, you know? But I said to the people, \u201cYou know, there was a few King, but the majority were people working. Why don\u2019t you think you\u2019d be a normal human body working to make a living? You have more people who make eighteen, twenty thousand a year in United 37 State than people who make a hundred fifty thousand.

I don\u2019t want to live until a hundred and twenty with nothing, with Alzheimer or thinking about how am I going to survive, or... God is wise, he knows when to tell you to come back. And if medicine 1s strong enough to keep you alive, this is ridiculous. When somebody has to go, let him go. The best way, but let him go. And when it\u2019s your time, it\u2019s time.

I did have, when I was in France, I did have a lot of priest coming in my office. The reason is, my wife brother was a monk and he send me a lot of people, because I did have a lot of success.

He said, \u201cYou think this guy, you know, this doctor, can help me?\u201d He was in bad, bad shape. And his brother, who lives in Paris said, \u201cLet me ask him.\u201d So, the monsignor calls me and he said, \u201cIf I send you the plane from the Pope and I pay all the expense and you tell me your price, would you come for a weekend at the Vatican?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, but you have to remember one thing, I\u2019m born from Jewish parent.\u201d He said, \u201cGod is Jewish.\u201d I said, \u201cIf you take it this way, any time you want, any weekend.\u201d So, he send me a plane and did go there, took care of him. And he show me my room and on the top of, above the bed was the Christ. And I said, \u201cYou have to take this out, because, you know, as Jewish, you tell me I kill him and trust me, I didn\u2019t kill him. And I don\u2019t think Jewish people did.\u201d So, he took it away. We did have wonderful discussion. And when I came back, you know, he was very, very happy. We spend beautiful hour of discussion. And he said, \u201cIf one day you have the vocation and God...\u201d because we spoke about God and I told him my relation with God. And he say, \u201cIf God ask you to become a Catholic, would you accept?\u201d And I said, \u201cIf God ask me, yes I will. But Monsignor, I\u2019m going to tell you one thing, maybe it\u2019s going to be a Catholic, one more Catholic, but I will be Jew for the rest of my life.\u201d And he said, \u201cI think so.\u201d [Laughing. |"

If you have a problem with your stomach, I know everything about stomach. But the problem is, in the body, the stomach is part of the body.

            "answer": "Chiropractic? Chiropractic is based on nerve pressure. Everything come from the brain. Mine basic idea of psychosomatic is so strong. You can help yourself or you can destroy yourself. There\u2019s a doctor, I saw this on 20/20 not long time ago. There\u2019s a doctor, he must be around sixty-five years old in New York. And he take care of any, any low back pain with a hundred percent success just by explaining thing for twenty minutes to the patient. And I was listening to, I didn\u2019t hear what he was saying for the twenty minute, but I understood the concept, and it makes sense. And he is in a hospital and all the other doctor laugh at him, but he\u2019s got a hundred percent success, because he teach you how to say when you wake up in the morning and you have pain on your back, and you say, \u201cOh honey, I think I\u2019m not going to be able to go to work. My pain kills me and it\u2019s going to be a horrible day.\u201d And if I can teach you how to speak to your back\u2014and this is what he does\u2014sure it\u2019s going to be hard to start, but little by little the pain is going to go away. Everything, almost, is psychosomatic. Cancer, and I don\u2019t speak about HIV and sickness like this, which is acquired. This is different. But I mean any, anything inside of your body is psychosomatic. You can make it worse or you can make it better. And if somebody for any reason, you have a baby, find a doctor who is going to be with you all the time. And if you have any problem, you be able to give him a call and said, \u201cI feel this and this,\u201d and he should have an answer to tell you. \u201cIt\u2019s normal because of this or this or this, think this way and you'll feel better.\u201d\u201d You have to have a dialogue. The doctor is here to help you, to help your psychic. Everything is almost 99.5 percent psychosomatic. And if the doctor understand this and can direct you... You know a lot of people come to acupuncture and said, \u201cI hate needle.\u201d And I said, \u201cIf I tell you, you are not going to feel it.\u201d Okay, I can tell this until tomorrow and if I put in a needle and it\u2019s painful, he\u2019s going to say, \u201cYou lied to me. It\u2019s painful.\u201d But if the patient is on the table and I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to put a needle. As soon as there is any pain tell me. I take the needle out. But the way, I put the needle and where I put the needle, you shouldn\u2019t feel nothing.\u201d 99 percent people say, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel it.\u201d This is one form of hypnosis: to do acupuncture. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Patient who come bent and they have low back pain. Put them on the table, start to massage a little bit the back and speak to them, tell them about vacation. What do you like, flying, thing like this. I adjust them, if I didn\u2019t speak to them, I couldn\u2019t touch them. You touch them a little bit: \u201cOh, it\u2019s painful.\u201d You put a little bit under hypnosis and give an adjustment and that\u2019s it. And the patient goes away. It looks simple the way I explain, but this is the way it goes. It\u2019s very simple. Unless I play the doctor, \u201cYou lay down here. I\u2019m going to adjust you. It\u2019s going to be painful, but you have nothing for nothing. You have to suffer.\u201d They say, \u201cJust a minute, let me think about.\u201d It\u2019s psychosomatic, I mean, everything is in your head. \u201cI\u2019m going to adjust you, but I don\u2019t know if I going to help you.\u201d \u201cWell, so don\u2019t touch me.

And every 42 time I did this, they spank me. \u201cWhy did you spank me?\u201d \u201cBecause you are too nervous, take your time. You\u2019re going to get it. Justa minute. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d And this was hard, but you learn. It\u2019s always the same. My father used to tell a story when he was in Russia. He said, a guy did have a horse and it cost him a lot of money to feed him. So, little by little this farmer start to feed him less and less and less, until one day he died, the horse. And the farmer said, \u201cThis 1s too bad. Just the day he was used to not to eat, he die.\u201d And for me is the same thing. When I\u2019m going to be almost perfect, \u2019'm going to go away.

No, it\u2019s not a waste of time, because it\u2019s going to serve me for my next... my teacher of acupuncture in China told me, \u201cPaul, it\u2019s your first life as an acupuncturist. You okay, but you not wonderful. You need four life of acupuncture. The fourth life, you\u2019re going to be perfect. And this is going to be the time, probably, you going to stay there. You don\u2019t come back.\u201d And I said, \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging because I have three more life to go. Okay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d [Laughing. ]"

And he became an M.D. and he want to learn acupuncture, but the only way to learn and write a book about acupuncture, he did have to learn Chinese. So, he became an M.D. for a big family in China. He learned Chinese and he learn acupuncture. And I have his book with me. It was five, six year before I was born. Born in 1932, so it was \u201825, 1925. And he did a complete study of acupuncture. And I read this book three time and I said to a lot of people, if this house get in fire, the only thing I\u2019m going to save is this book, because it\u2019s got everything in it. And I read the book and I said, \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky maybe one day I\u2019m going to study acupuncture.\u201d And I got a chance one day to go to Taiwan and I did go to the school. I start my study, came back with all the books. And since \u201865, let\u2019s say I start to put needle in patient five year later.

I just receive a letter from mine, I don\u2019t know how you call this, godmother? And from what I understand he 1s not in this world anymore. I think my godfather die. So, she is there, she must be over eighty. So this, before the Christmas, this coming Christmas, I\u2019m going to go back. And I try to reach her by phone to find out how she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s not the same address, it\u2019s another address. So, I want to find out.

She didn\u2019t have any, she didn\u2019t ever study. She didn\u2019t know how to write, to read. She was reading Jewish, Hebrew. And it took her about a week, a week and a half to read one paper in Hebrew. But she was very, she was very smart, not by studying, but by instinct. And she... people like her. The only thing I found out, is when people don\u2019t have any background of studying to read aloud, when they get old, they lose this normal instinct of life. They are confused. And I did have a lot of very Ph.D. men, who got Alzheimer\u2019s disease, so it doesn\u2019t go with... but most of the time, these people, like my mother, like my brother, they don\u2019t have the training of the brain to be able to hold on, on something solid. It\u2019s only by memory. They don\u2019t have any technique. And the older she got, harder it was for us to discuss with her. She was, imagine things, like one day she was watching TV and it was something completely normal and she got very angry. And I said, \u2018\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t see what they did on this TV?\u201d And then I realize, well, she didn\u2019t understand and she got mad. But otherwise, she was a very interesting person. I cannot speak about my father because I was too young when he died. But it, she was, she connect with my godfather when we did go see him, because my godfather was also very, very educated, a very interesting, wide idea of the world. And they did have, I remember a very, very interesting conversation, in a high level, not \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day today. The food was good.\u201d It was... and mine, his wife of my godfather, she was a teacher. I was in love with her, because she was, I think, the most beautiful woman in the world. She was smart. And I was afraid from her, because she was a teacher. At my age, a teacher you don\u2019t fool around with.

It means, you know, it\u2019s like do we have anti-Semitism in United State? Yes. Why, we don\u2019t know. But one day I spoke 48 with a woman from Lexington, she\u2019s a doctor. And she does acupuncture and she one day asked me if she can come and watch me. And we start to speak about things, I don\u2019t remember exactly what it was and she said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. The Jew, they have all the money. They have all the bank. Don\u2019t ever trust a Jew.\u201d [Laughing.]| I didn\u2019t know what to say. And I said, \u201cI have to tell you just now, I\u2019m Jewish. And why do you...\u201d and she said, \u201cOh, because maybe you are not like this, but the Jew have all the bank. They got all the money in this country. They are politician. They going to ruin the whole United State.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, if you feel this way, I think this meeting is going to be the last one.\u201d And it was the last one. But, you know, when somebody is... at this point I know I\u2019m going to be with an enemy all the time. So tell me who is my friend, I will find my enemy."

            "answer": "No. United State is a nice place to live. It is much simpler than France. You can be independent, more than in France. You can have, they don\u2019t look at you like in France. They spy the same way in United State, but it\u2019s a different way. It\u2019s much easier. In France, they spy on you much more. And they don\u2019t have the law you have in United State. You know, the Constitution here, it\u2019s very well made. Freedom of Speech is very important. We don\u2019t have freedom. United State is a Democracy. France is a Republic. And it can take hour for me to explain to you, but I think you know the difference between Democracy and Republic. And here you can live... I was surprised how many people was killed in United State by crime last year. Twenty-five thousand people die. It\u2019s a lot of people. We don\u2019t have so many dead in France by crime because we don\u2019t have this access of gun and all this. But there is no safe place on Earth. And America is one of the most happy place you can be. You can live a normal life, almost. You can buy a car when you want. If you are courageous and work hard, you can make money, enjoy yourself. But the limit is very short in United State. And what is the limit? My idea of limit 1s six hundred thousand dollar. Not everybody can save six hundred thousand dollar, but after six hundred thousand dollar\u2014and if you want, one day I\u2019m going to explain this to you\u2014 everything, if you die or your husband die and leave you a million dollar, you\u2019re going to get six hundred thousand dollar. The rest goes to the government, no matter how you go. They... the IRS law are very, very well made. They give you this, they take this. They get you anyway. So if you have a little bit, if you are low profile, United State 1s perfect. I am a low profile doctor and it\u2019s okay. I like this life. I don\u2019t have any problem. But people who become rich, they do, they can, but they have to know how to do it. I wouldn\u2019t like to be rich in the United State. [Laughing]"

            "answer": "Well, number one is because I was a little bit tired about what I was feeling in France. And it was time for me to change and this was some feeling. I have feeling sometime and this was the time for me to go away. Even I did have a very good practice in France, everything was going fine, but [clears throat|\u2014excuse me\u2014it was time for me to do something else. And since before I left United State in 1962, I took the State Board of Kentucky. I came back in Kentucky to establish... and I didn\u2019t know where. I choose Lexington because it was a challenge. And I decide to open an office here and later maybe go to another state. Because when you come back in United State with a license, you have to stay at least three year in the state, before you can move to another one. I tried to have the equivalence of my medical license here and I found out Kentucky is one of the most difficult state to have a reciprocity of the diploma. So, I decide I\u2019m going to have mine, I did have mine license for Chiropractic, so I took my chiropractic license, 50 renew it, and I stay here. And since 1983, I did have three different office, one in Versailles Road, the another one in North Broadway for at least fourteen year and now in Palomar. And it was very, very interesting. I like the state. I like the weather. A little bit cold in the winter time, but... I like horses, so I\u2019m very happy when I can drive in the country and see all the horses. I have a lot of friend who have horses. I ride a lot of horses. And I travel a lot. I give a lot of seminar in United State and in Europe. I go to China once every five year to re-educate mine acupuncture. And life is great here. Right now I have a project. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to do it. But either I\u2019m going to move to the Caribbean in an island where there is already a chiropractor. And I\u2019m going to go see him probably at the end of this month, September, 1999. Or if I don\u2019t like what I see there, I probably going to buy a farm in Woodford County around Versailles, like we say here. And have a farm with horses and my practice at the same time until I die. So, this is going to be my project until the end of 1999. Thinking about what, I don\u2019t know if it is going to be different in the year two thousand. Everybody think about something different. I don\u2019t think nothing is going to happen, but anyway it doesn\u2019t make any difference for me. And this is my project. I was very happy for my move to come here. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s very, even up to this day since 1983 I\u2019m back in United State, even up to this day it is very hard for me to adapt to the American life, but it\u2019s not too bad. And Ill survive. And we\u2019ll see what my project are going to give me and what am I going to do. But it\u2019s going to be a surprise for myself and for my friends."

They in France, they live different. They have different personality. Here, we don\u2019t eat, we nourish ourselves. In France a meal is like a big festivity. We take our time. Relation between male and female in France is much more romantic. It is much more something sensitive, sensual. Here it\u2019s much more difficult, woman wants to be man. Sometimes man become woman. It 1s, it would take a whole book to explain the difference between France and United State. But when you want, you adapt. And I go back to France at least once or twice a year. Every time I go, I enjoy. I have a good time. I read almost everything in French, because since I left France, I think poetry in France is beautiful. And there 1s no problem, you always survive. You adapt and you survive. You don\u2019t have always exactly what you want, but where do we have what we want? It\u2019s another world and it\u2019s for me like another life."

Did go back home, open my office. And I receive my license from Kentucky and this is why I came back here. And when I came back here, I thought maybe I\u2019m going to go to another state, but after a while I said, where can I go? It\u2019s nothing worse here or better than any other place.

No, it\u2019s... for me, there are two kind of bad Jew in this world, the German Jew and the American Jew. I don\u2019t have any respect for the German. We call them the Yecket (ph).

They can live their life, but I\u2019m Jewish by tradition. I don\u2019t go to the synagogue. And they go to the synagogue. They do the Bar Mitzvah for the kids, but it\u2019s not my kind.

People have become much more aware of Holocaust history and much more interested in it, 1t seems, on a popular culture level, a lot of books, films and so forth. Have you been interested at all in speaking publicly about those experiences that you\u2019ve had?",
            "answer": "No, because my, the way they do it now, is became movies, to make movies. It\u2019s always very hard to make a good movie. This is a good subject. Books, the writer will write about another writer, who wrote something about the Holocaust. It becomes diluted. And I think... men like my brother, for example, who survive Holocaust, doesn\u2019t want to speak in public, because they wouldn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s got to say. I mean, they wouldn\u2019t... they say, that\u2019s impossible, you tell us a story. Story he told me, I know it\u2019s true, because he wouldn\u2019t lie to me. And he\u2019s not a liar. But I can put myself in the shoes of somebody who never heard about Holocaust, listen to what he\u2019s got to say. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It is the truth, but it doesn\u2019t make sense. This didn\u2019t happen. It can\u2019t be done. So, right now, sure, more we do about the Holocaust Museum, the best it is because it helps for people not to forget. But it\u2019s the basic. Unless somebody is really interested on what happen and I mean Jewish people who are interested, they can find this someplace. But in public, you know... my brother did go to Germany in a school to speak about Holocaust and half of the class didn\u2019t know what was Holocaust. \u201cWhat do you mean by Holocaust? What is it? A fruit? A piece of bread? What is Holocaust?\u201d So. You know you speak in front of people about something they don\u2019t understand. They don\u2019t have a clue of what you talking about. They say, \u201cWhat is he talking about? Did he make a movie?\u201d Schindler List was something close to the Holocaust and it make sense. It was human. Auschwitz is unhuman. You tell things about Auschwitz. It is not real. It\u2019s a bad dream. And you have people listen to... \u201cThis guy is nuts. He doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about.\u201d But this happen. So, right now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good, I mean the best thing 1s to have museum and encourage people... my attorney here sent his son\u2014he\u2019s Jewish\u2014he sent his son at Washington. And when he came back, he didn\u2019t speak for one week. And the father said, \u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He said, \u201cI was shocked. What they did to Jewish people. I was shocked from what I saw.\u201d So, I think the most important is to send people there, children, the new generation, for them to see what happened. When I did go to Auschwitz, full bus of school kids used to come in Auschwitz to see the crematorium where all the Jewish die. And I think this is wonderful, because we should never forget what happened. But speaking in the public and 55 explaining things, it\u2019s not enough. You have to visualize. You have to see things. This is why the Museum is important."

            "question": "Can you talk more about what that whole trip was like?",
            "answer": "Well, we left from Paris to Warsaw and Auschwitz. It was very short, because it\u2019s very close to Paris. And we stay in a crummy hotel, because this was the only hotel in Auschwitz-Birkenau. We did, uh, Auschwitz is a military camp, military place. This is where there all the glasses from the Jewish people who die. The clothes, the hair, the shoes, the denture. And you see all this exposed behind glass. And after this you go in the barrack and wood where they live. And I think it is very impressive and it is real. The only thing my brother was surprised when we did go the first time and he said, \u201cSomething is different.\u201d\u2019 The barrack 1s the same, the whole thing. The grass, it was grass, high grass. By the time people were there, you didn\u2019t have any grass. Why? Because they eat the grass. So, the little piece of grass on the ground was eat, it was food. This is why it was different. But otherwise, the whole thing, the concentration camp, I mean the crematorium, everything was... there is a little lake in the middle of the camp, not very big, where they put all the ashes of the dead people. Below forty degree in winter time, this lake never froze, because of the grease of the human body. And a lot of things like this. It is, I think, a place to see. I think if I was an American Jew, this is the first place I want to go. I want to see what happened. But when you say this to Jewish people, they say \u201cI have better place to go.\u201d I say, \u201cGood for you.\u201d"

            "answer": "Yeah, yeah. It was very important to be together. For me to see where he was, where did he sleep, how did he live? What was the... everything is dead anymore. I have a lot of feeling when I go some place. There was no feeling, everything is gone. The only thing stay is the wall, the cabin, the wood barrack, but everything is gone. The spirit is gone. But it\u2019s very impressive. This is where you see the railroad train would arrive and it stop right there. All the Jewish people did go down, the ones going to go to the gas chamber on this right, the one who 1s going to live a little bit, on the left. And, I mean, this is something you have to see. And I have to say, I\u2019m very thankful to the Polish government, who are the most anti-Semitic people in this earth, to maintain the camp the way it is. It\u2019s very, very important to keep it the way it 1s, because, like I said, most... a lot of people have to see this. But they do a good job. And it\u2019s free, the entrance is free. And everything is kept the way it was. And it\u2019s something to see."

But I think now, we saw the overall picture and now it\u2019s 56 going to be your job to put this together. And it was a very nice interview and I was very happy to do it."
