            "answer": "It was March in 1942, when they did go to Ausc hwitz. Before it was a camp a little bit outside of Paris called Drancy, where all the Jewish people been put together for a length of time, I think it was between eight and ten month. Where they st art to shape the whole thing: \ufb01Are we going to send them? What kind of train are we going to use?\ufb02 It was another camp not far from there, called Compi\u00e8gne, which was also the same ki nd. So... there is a man, who came here in Lexington, a Jewish man, who gave something\u2013 I\u2122v e got something, I will remember his name. And he explained what the German did have in mind. And it\u2122s amazing the way they did organize the whole thing. Even it was a lot of Jewish people, put together in a train, they didn\u2122t know nothing, from where they come, what they going to do, where they going to go. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 7 7Everything was real on paper. The train company didn\u2122t know what they were going to transport, because it was special train for an imals. So, it was so well organized, and they prepared all this and from each country it was the same thing. From Poland it was another way. From Yugoslavia it was another way. From Au stria it was another way. It was really a technique they did have. And the top of those guys , I\u2122m afraid to say he was a brain, because he was crazy. But his name was Himmler, and he organized the whole thing. And he organized this very well. And you know, the Jewish people who\u2122ve been in camp, most of them were, what we call here blue-collar, simple people. They didn\u2122t think we\u2122re going to kill them. Even until they arrive in the camp, when they say, the SS was on, say, one side, \ufb01You go this way, you go this way.\ufb02 No, it was nothing. The only time my br other realized he was in a bad direction is when one time, coming down from the train, he didn\u2122t go fast enough. The SS slapped his face. And he was nineteen years old. Then he realized something is going to happen, now it\u2122s another world. But until then, well it was hard, they didn\u2122t have anything to eat in the train. They didn\u2122t have any water. They didn\u2122t have any... but it\u2122s going to clear up, no problem. They didn\u2122t realize they go to the butcher. They go to die, by thousands. And this was the life. They did go, because the only one who realize what\u2122s going on were the educated people, the attorney, the doctor, the people who did study. But they were not many people. When my brother was deported in Auschwitz, it was a guy with him, who was, I think he was a colonel in the French army. And he said, \ufb01They are going to do nothing to me. I\u2122m a colonel from the French army.\ufb02 He died like all the one, just because he was Jew. That\u2122s all. They didn\u2122t care he was a colonel. He did have a high education.

It was a line between the North and South and you have to pass the Zone. And some French people for money, they direct you between the army. And I did go in South in Gren oble. And when I arrive in Grenoble, a friend of my mother took me and three days later sh e came down. And we stay... and I don\u2122t remember how long, maybe couple months, three months. And it became very dangerous to stay there. So, she send me to my father. And where my father was, was more dangerous than there, so they decide... I came back to see my mother and my mo ther, remember I was nine years old. So, they decide to send me to Switzerland with a group of Jewish people, boys.

And I did go to Grenoble, from Switzerland to Grenoble where my mother used to live. And I didn\u2122t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 17 17find her. So, I did go to, there was a Jewish association in Grenoble, so I did go there. And they said they knew about my mother.

We\u2122ll buy you a ticket.\ufb02 They bought me a ticket, train again. And I did go to Paris.

And before we left, this lady from the Jewish associat ion sent a wire to my mo ther and when I arrive in the train station in Paris, my mother and Gaston were there waiting for me. And we did go see, we did go to the apartment of her sister , who die in Auschwitz and it was nobody in the apartment. It was a very small apartment and oh, maybe... time for me is very hard... maybe two months later or three months la ter, the Jewish people from the camp, from Auschwitz, Dachau, Buchenwald, all those places, start to come back in Paris. And it was a big hotel, called Hotel Lutecia (ph) prepare for clean them, to ask paper, if they got anything, you know. And Hotel Lutecia call us and say we have one Pressma n. So, we did go there right away and it was Bernard. But we couldn\u2122t see him. We didn\u2122 t know where he was. So, we wait, go, ask, couldn\u2122t find him. The next day... so, we did go home at this apartment and the next day we receive a man, who said, \ufb01Your son did go to the old apartment,\ufb02 who was let\u2122s say like, five blocks from where we were. So, we did go by f oot, walking and here, is coming, my brother. This is where we find out my other brother was d ead. He was killed in Auschwitz. And Bernard was alive. Then we did go to the apartment of my aunt, sister of my mo ther, and life started to re-organize. We want to recupe rate the fabric of my father. Everything was gone, but at least the wall was there and my brother decided to\u0160becau se he was trained by my father\u0160to open the place. And with my mother, they start to re-open the place and I started to go to college, to school, to school first. And after I decided to go to college. And it was a little fight, family fight, because they want me to be an upholsterer like my father and I said no, I want to study medicine. Everybody said, \ufb01But we cannot help you,\ufb02 and I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t ask for help. I will work myself.\ufb02 I found a little room and I wa s working, doing a lot of things and studying medicine. After this, I became the doctor of the family. [Laughing]"

            "answer": "Uh huh. Yeah, it was a very, very interesting. I think I wouldn\u2122t study all the study I did, if I didn\u2122t go with Pastor Lederman and his wife.

So, I did have to take the bus and I didn\u2122t like it all. But he said, \ufb01No, you have a wonderful religion, you have to keep with it. Okay. And I don\u2122t want for you, unless you feel, but you don\u2122t have no obligation to come in my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 18 18church.

The second Sunday he introduce me to all the congregation. Swiss people are very, very nice people. And they treat me like the son of the house. They give me a room. I rememb er they did have a German Shepherd, who was trained. He was in the same time\u0160I don\u2122t know how you call this\u0160a priest who take care of prison people. And he used to go with his dog, in case one of the prisoner did go away, the dog is going to be able... He was a very, very funny ma n, very smart, very funny man. And I help as much as I could. I carry the milk, because they di d have a lot of cow. So, I work outside of the school for three, four hour every day, carrying the milk from the cow to the company where they make the cheese. And it was really, a family. Th ey want me to learn how to play piano. They did have a piano. And since I have my own piano and I play because of them.

I spend with them less than one year, but I think the foundation of my life was based on this time I sp end with them, because they were so good and so hard. They were not... they were sweet, but they let me pass nothing. I did have my job to do and I better do it, otherwise\u2013 And it became nor mal with me and really I spend...

I say since a long time, we all have a ticket in the pocket. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 19 19You have the date of birth and there is no date where you\u2122re going to go, to be gone, but really there is one, but you don\u2122t know it. And it\u2122s funny, because I say to a lot of my patients, we celebrate birth of people, but we don\u2122t celebrate death and death is something of life. It\u2122s the end of life. If you did have a bad life, you\u2122re going to have a bad time to re-incarnate in a good life. But if you look your life and you said yes, I did have bad time like everybody else, but the good time were good. And when I remember all this , all the good time, it was wonderful. It\u2122s experience. And in life, you cannot have all the time, good time. A nd on top of this, I say this too, some of my good patient with whom I have a good exchange, money is important, but compared to destiny, money is nothing. Destiny is what is going to make you what you are. You are going to be able to enjoy anything: a fruit, a good meal, good company. And when I say good company, feeling you are with somebody, friends , and you are on the same level. You can exchange... if you say something a little bit diffe rent, people are not going to laugh. They are going to say either \ufb01What do you mean by this?\ufb02 or they\u2122re going to say, \ufb01I know what you mean.

You receive a bad bill, you have a bad problem, you have a flat tire in the middle of nowhe re... it\u2122s tough, but you have to deal with it.

You know, Jewish people accept Jewish jokes from another Jew, but if another one does the jokes, they don\u2122t like it. Did the Jewish people deserve what happened? I don\u2122t think so. Nobody deserve to suffer this way, but in the whole world, in the whole idea of human people, is it something who is going to serve humanity? I think so. I think so. How many people, who were in Auschwitz, in all those camps, are going to be ab le to use it? Minority. But the one who are going to be able to do it are going to bring something and we don\u2122t know where we\u2122re going to put this. On the newborn? There is a ne w book, written by a Rabbi, and people don\u2122t like him very much, because he write, he wrote this book a bout reincarnation. And he said a lot of people call him, write to him and they say, \ufb01I\u2122m born in a Catholic family. I\u2122m Catholic. I go to the church every Sunday. I believe on Jesus Christ and I believe in God, but inside of me I got this Jewish feeling and I don\u2122t understand why.\ufb02 And it\u2122s uh, how can I say, it\u2122s surprising. And from what he say, he thinks they were in the Holocaust and they reincarnate in another corps, but they got this knowledge and they want to explain this. Long time ago, maybe not so long, but twenty years ago, you never spoke about reincarnation. A lot of people knew about, but they don\u2122t want to say anything, because they say, \ufb01Well, they going to think I\u2122m crazy.\ufb02 Now it is more open. Sometime when I feel people react an d it\u2122s a small group... I give a lot of lecture on acupuncture, and acupuncture related to the human body and the illness of some people. And I go a little bit further and reincarnation and a lot of people react and say, \ufb01I felt this. I felt I was in another life. I cannot pinpoint, but I know this is not my first life.\ufb02 So, I think, coming back to the idea of the Holocaust, it served a purpose, which one, I don\u2122t know. But I\u2122m sure it serve a purpose. If you say this to my brother, he\u2122s going to laugh for three hour, but it\u2122s okay. And I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 20 20mean, it\u2122s his problem, it\u2122s not mine. I don\u2122t brin g any proof, but I know there is a purpose. Can it be another Holocaust? Yes.

And it\u2122s a feeling very hard to explain, because like when I open my office... she came in. She wants to organize my office. And I said, \ufb01Mother, it\u2122s my office, it\u2122s my place and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 28 28I\u2122m going to organize it my way. You like it, you come.

But so the relati on was not, I saw my mother, jump on her, kiss her? No. And my mother was not a kisser. One kiss a week was the top, no more. So she stay in her, in her back, and I stay, and my other br other, Gaston, is\u2013 it was, is and was a very funny character. He looks good and it was enough for him. So, he was thinking more to buy nice suit, nice thing. And when I came back he was a growing man and you know, he didn\u2122t want to bother with me. I was the little boy. So, the relation was short.

And it was a discovery for, I think, every Jewish people in the world when we found out Israelian soldier were one of the best in the world.

Right now, every night you cry, you scream, because you are in the camp now. If you forgive, let them worry about their problem, but get rid of it.\ufb02 What did I say? So, he send me, even two weeks ago he send me a book I couldn\u2122t find here. And it is in French. I like to read in French.

            "answer": "When I was in France, on my spare time when I was a student of medi cine, I learn hypnosis. I was very interested in hypnosis. I put a lady through surgery under hypnosis. And you have a lot of technique. And mainly this technique of forgiveness, which I didn\u2122t know before and I was very happy to learn and practice this first on me. Every time I was mad at somebody or things I didn\u2122t like, I did try to forgive the people I was speaking, I mean not openly, but in my mind. And this way it was easy for me to be able to discuss with people. Some people have a natural way of being patient. I\u2122m not patient, so I did want to find some thing who is not going to make me patient, but make me a normal human being. And those technique of forgiveness is so\u2013 we hear this in the Catholic religion. Fo rgive and God will forgive you. I always say to a lot of people, I don\u2122t need any church because if I have a problem, I speak with God directly. It is fifty percent joke and fifty percent true, it goes together. Because another human being like me, ah, how intelligent he can be? What can he do with God, I cannot do directly if I want to do it? And this forgiveness came b ack to me. And one day I was in a course of hypnosis and the teacher said, \ufb01Today we\u2122re going to speak only ab out forgiveness.\ufb02 And I thought, God, this is great, and I learned every bit of it. And I practice this with me and with my patient. And it was wonderful, because people used to say, \ufb01I didn\u2122 t think this way before, but now it make it so easy.\ufb02 And I thought to myself, I know, because I practice the same way for myself. The more I can forgive things, easy my life is, and I come back always to the point zero. If you let, if you do a mistake and you go too far with this mistake, it\u2122s very... longer you keep with, harder it is to come back. So, try to rectify the mistake as s oon as you can, so this way it\u2122s going to be much easier to work on it and it\u2122s going to be quicker. So they teach you every time at night before you, when you go to bed, before you go to sleep, try to go very fast on your day and say, \ufb01Okay what happened today? What did I do that was not good?\ufb02 So you try to forget yourself by being sorry and said \ufb01I\u2122m not going to do this any more. I\u2122m going to try to be better,\ufb02 and also vice and versa, one way or another way. It\u2122s amazing th e way it works. It\u2122s something very simple. The only thing is, if you are willing to do it, it\u2122s perfect. If you don\u2122t want to do it, it\u2122s very hard. And this is why, I try. I stay about two weeks with my brother. I said, \ufb01Bernard, I\u2122m sorry. You\u2122re going to be mad, if you want to throw me out from your house, you do it. But every day I\u2122m going to speak to you about forgiveness, beca use this is your only savior.\ufb02 But he laugh, he became red sometime, he left the room, he took witness, friend. Okay, he took friend who thought like him. And you know, if you ask a friend, after all the story of the camp, he survive and he say, \ufb01Bloing (ph), face to face, can I forgive this?\ufb02 People say, \ufb01No.\ufb02 But this is not what I ask him. I don\u2122t ask him to forgive this wa y. I want for him to forgive them their fault, they are the worst people. He is not a bad man. So forgive them for what they did to them and to you. But it was\u2013 I don\u2122t think... maybe I put a little someth ing on the ground, but for him it is too late. And I think, it\u2122s not nice what I\u2122m going to say, but I think also he enjoy a little bit his situation."

And he show me my room and on the top of, above the bed was the Christ. And I said, \ufb01You have to take this out, because, you know, as Jewish, you tell me I kill him and trust me, I didn\u2122t kill him. And I don\u2122t th ink Jewish people did.\ufb02 So, he took it away. We did have wonderful discussion. And when I came back, you know, he was very, very happy. We spend beautiful hour of discussion. And he said, \ufb01If one day you have the vocation and God...\ufb02 because we spoke about God and I told him my relation with God. And he say, \ufb01If God ask you to become a Catholic, would you accept?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01If God ask me, yes I will. But Monsignor, I\u2122m going to tell you one thing, maybe it\u2122s going to be a Catholic, one more Catholic, but I will be Jew for the rest of my lif e.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01I think so.\ufb02 [Laughing.]"

You can help yourself or you can destroy yourself. There\u2122s a doctor, I saw this on 20/20 not long time ago. There\u2122s a doctor, he must be around sixty-five years old in New York. And he take care of any, any low back pain with a hundred percent success just by explaining thing for twenty minutes to the patient. And I was listening to, I didn\u2122t hear what he was saying for the twenty minute, but I understood the concept, and it makes sense. And he is in a hospital and all th e other doctor laugh at him, but he\u2122s got a hundred percent success, because he teach you how to say when you wake up in the morning and you have pain on your back, and you say, \ufb01Oh honey, I think I\u2122m not going to be able to go to work. My pain kills me and it\u2122s going to be a horrible day.\ufb02 And if I can teach you how to speak to your back\u0160and this is what he does\u0160sure it\u2122s going to be hard to start, but little by little the pain is going to go away. Everything, almost, is psychosomatic. Cancer, and I don\u2122t speak about HIV and sickness like this, which is acquired. This is different. But I mean any, anything inside of your body is psychosomatic. You can make it worse or you can make it better. And if somebody for any reason, you have a baby, find a doc tor who is going to be with you all the time. And if you have any problem, you be able to gi ve him a call and said, \ufb01I feel this and this,\ufb02 and he should have an answer to tell you. \ufb01It\u2122s norm al because of this or this or this, think this way and you\u2122ll feel better.\ufb02 You have to have a dialogue. The doctor is here to help you, to help your psychic. Everything is almost 99.5 percen t psychosomatic. And if the doctor understand this and can direct you... You know a lot of pe ople come to acupuncture and said, \ufb01I hate needle.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01If I tell you, you are not going to feel it.\ufb02 Okay, I can tell this until tomorrow and if I put in a needle and it\u2122s painfu l, he\u2122s going to say, \ufb01You lied to me. It\u2122s painful.\ufb02 But if the patient is on the table and I said, \ufb01Okay, I\u2122m going to put a needle. As soon as there is any pain tell me. I take the needle out. But the way, I put th e needle and where I put the needle, you shouldn\u2122t feel nothing.\ufb02 99 percent people say, \ufb01I didn\u2122t feel it.\ufb02 This is one form of hypnosis: to do acupunctu re. \ufb01What did you do to me?\ufb02 Patient who come bent and they have low back pain. Put them on the table, start to massage a little bit the back and speak to them, tell them about vacation. What do you like, fl ying, thing like this. I ad just them, if I didn\u2122t speak to them, I couldn\u2122t touch them. You touch them a little bit: \ufb01Oh, it\u2122 s painful.\ufb02 You put a little bit under hypnosis and give an adjustment and that\u2122s it. And the patient goes away. It looks simple the way I explain, but this is the wa y it goes. It\u2122s very simple. Unless I play the doctor, \ufb01You lay down here. I\u2122m going to adju st you. It\u2122s going to be painful, but you have nothing for nothing. You have to suffer.\ufb02 They say, \ufb01Just a minute, let me think about.\ufb02 It\u2122s psychosomatic, I mean, everything is in your hea d. \ufb01I\u2122m going to adjust you, but I don\u2122t know if I going to help you.\ufb02 \ufb01Well, so don\u2122t touch me.

United State is a Democracy. France is a Republic. And it can take hour for me to explain to you, but I think you know the difference between Democracy and Republic. And here you can live... I was surprised how many people was killed in United State by crime last year. Twenty-five thousand people die. It\u2122s a lot of people. We don\u2122t have so many dead in France by crime because we don\u2122t have this access of gun and all this. But there is no safe place on Earth. And America is one of the most happy place you can be. You can live a normal life, almost. You can buy a car when you want. If you are courageous and work hard, you can make money, enjoy yourself. But the limit is very short in Unite d State. And what is the limit? My idea of limit is six hundred thousand dollar. Not ever ybody can save six hundred thousand dollar, but after six hundred thousand dollar\u0160and if you want, one day I\u2122m going to explain this to you\u0160everything, if you die or your husband die and le ave you a million dollar, you\u2122re going to get six hundred thousand dollar. The rest goes to the government, no matte r how you go. They... the IRS law are very, very well made. They give you this, they take this. They get you anyway. So if you have a little bit, if you are low profile, Unit ed State is perfect. I am a low profile doctor and it\u2122s okay. I like this life. I don\u2122t have any problem. But people who become rich, they do, they can, but they have to know how to do it. I wouldn\u2122t like to be rich in the United State. [Laughing]"

            "answer": "Well, number one is because I was a little bit ti red about what I was feeling in France. And it was time for me to change and this was some fee ling. I have feeling sometime and this was the time for me to go away. Even I did have a very good practice in France, everything was going fine, but [clears throat]\u0160excuse me\u0160it was time for me to do something else. And since before I left United State in 1962, I took the State Board of Kentucky. I came back in Kentucky to establish... and I didn\u2122t know where. I choose Lexington because it was a challenge. And I decide to open an office here and later maybe go to another state. Because when you come back in United State with a license, you have to stay at least three year in the state, before you can move to another one. I tried to have the equivalence of my me dical license here and I found out Kentucky is one of the most difficult state to have a reciprocity of the diploma. So, I decide I\u2122m going to have mine, I did have mine license for Chiropractic, so I took my chiropractic license, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 51 51renew it, and I stay here. And since 1983, I did have three differ ent office, one in Versailles Road, the another one in North Broadway for at least fourteen y ear and now in Palomar. And it was very, very interesting. I like the state. I like the weather. A little bit cold in the winter time, but\u2013 I like horses, so I\u2122m very happy when I can drive in the country and see all the horses. I have a lot of friend who have horses. I ride a lot of horses. And I travel a lot. I give a lot of seminar in United State and in Europe. I go to China once every five year to re-educate mine acupuncture. And life is great here. Right now I have a project. I don\u2122t know if I\u2122m going to do it. But either I\u2122m going to move to the Cari bbean in an island where there is already a chiropractor. And I\u2122m going to go see him probabl y at the end of this month, September, 1999. Or if I don\u2122t like what I see there, I probably going to buy a farm in Woodford County around Versailles, like we say here. And have a farm with horses and my practice at the same time until I die. So, this is going to be my project until the end of 1999. Thinking about what, I don\u2122t know if it is going to be different in the year two thousand. Everybody think about something different. I don\u2122t think nothing is going to happen, but anyway it doesn\u2122t make any difference for me. And this is my project. I was very happy for my move to come here. It\u2122s different. It\u2122s very, even up to this day since 1983 I\u2122m back in Un ited State, even up to this day it is very hard for me to adapt to the American life, but it\u2122s not too bad. And I\u2122ll survive. And we\u2122ll see what my project are going to give me and what am I go ing to do. But it\u2122s going to be a surprise for myself and for my friends."

They in France, they live different. They have different personality. Here, we don\u2122t eat, we nourish ourselves. In France a meal is like a big festivity. We take our time. Relation betw een male and female in France is much more romantic. It is much more something sensitive, sensual. Here it\u2122s much more difficult, woman wants to be man. Sometimes ma n become woman. It is, it woul d take a whole book to explain the difference between France and United State. But when you want, you adapt. And I go back to France at least once or twice a year. Every time I go, I enjo y. I have a good time. I read almost everything in French, because since I left France, I think poetry in France is beautiful. And there is no problem, you always survive. You adapt and you survive. You don\u2122t have always exactly what you want, but where do we have what we want? It\u2122s another world and it\u2122s for me like another life."

People have become much more aware of Holocaust history and much more interested in it, it seems, on a popular culture level, a lot of books, films and so forth. Have you been interested at all in speaking publicly about those experiences that you\u2122ve had?",
            "answer": "No, because my, the way they do it now, is beca me movies, to make movies. It\u2122s always very hard to make a good movie. This is a good subjec t. Books, the writer will write about another writer, who wrote something about the Holocaust . It becomes diluted. And I think... men like my brother, for example, who survive Holocaust, doesn\u2122t want to speak in public, because they wouldn\u2122t understand what he\u2122s got to say. I mean, they wouldn\u2122t... they say, that\u2122s impossible, you tell us a story. Story he told me, I know it\u2122s true, because he wouldn\u2122t lie to me. And he\u2122s not a liar. But I can put myse lf in the shoes of somebody who never heard about Holocaust, listen to what he\u2122s got to say. It doesn\u2122t make se nse. It is the truth, but it doesn\u2122t make sense. This didn\u2122t happen. It can\u2122t be done. So, right now, sure, more we do about the Holocaust Museum, the best it is because it helps for people not to forget. But it\u2122s the basic. Unless somebody is really interested on what happen and I mean Jewish people who are interested, they can find this someplace. But in public, you know... my brother did go to Germany in a school to speak about Holocaust and half of the class didn\u2122t know what was Holocaust. \ufb01What do you mean by Holocaust? What is it? A fruit? A piece of bread? What is Holocaust?\ufb02 So. You know you speak in front of people about someth ing they don\u2122t understand. They don\u2122t have a clue of what you talking about. They say, \ufb01What is he talking about? Did he make a movie?\ufb02 Schindler List was something close to the Holocaust and it make sense. It was human. Auschwitz is unhuman. You tell things about Auschwitz . It is not real. It\u2122s a bad dream. And you have people listen to... \ufb01This guy is nuts. He doesn\u2122t know what he is talking about.\ufb02 But this happen. So, right now, I don\u2122t think it\u2122s a good, I mean the best thing is to have museum and encourage people... my attorney here sent his son\u0160he\u2122s Jewish\u0160he sent his son at Washington. And when he came back, he didn\u2122 t speak for one week. And the father said, \ufb01What\u2122s the matter?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I was shocked. What they did to Jewish people. I was shocked from what I saw.\ufb02 So, I think the most impor tant is to send people there, children, the new generation, for them to see what happened. When I did go to Auschwitz, full bus of school kids used to come in Auschwitz to see the crematorium where all the Jewish die. And I think this is wonderful, because we should never forget what happened. But speaking in the public and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0002 56 56explaining things, it\u2122s not enough.

And we stay in a crummy hotel, because this was the only hotel in Auschwitz-Birkenau. We did, uh, Auschwitz is a military camp, military pl ace. This is where there all the glasses from the Jewish people who die. The clothes, th e hair, the shoes, the denture. And you see all this exposed behind glass. And after this you go in the barrack and wood where they live. And I think it is very impressive and it is real. Th e only thing my brother was surprised when we did go the first time and he said, \ufb01Something is differe nt.\ufb02 The barrack is the same, the whole thing. The grass, it was grass, high grass. By the time people were there, you didn\u2122t have any grass. Why? Because they eat the grass. So, the little piece of grass on the ground was eat, it was food. This is why it was different. But otherwise, the whole thing, the concentration camp, I mean the crematorium, everything was... there is a little lake in the middle of the camp, not very big, where they put all the ashes of the dead people.
