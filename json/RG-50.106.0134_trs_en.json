This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This is the follow-up interview that will focus on Mr. Weiss\u2019s post- Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview, I listened to the entire interview you recorded at the Simon Wiesenthal Center on July 28, 1994. I also listened to the first part of the interview you recorded with the Shoah Foundation on September 28, 1998. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that -- in -- in those interviews. Instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side A. What is your name?",
            "answer": "My name is Martin Weiss. I was born in Polana, Ch -- Czechoslovakia on January 28\" 1929."

So when they had the first elections and the communists won, we saw that the secret police or so was getting very strong. We decided that we di -- immediately to get papers as soon as possible and leave the country. So my brother-in-law had a brother in United States, so he got an affidavit from him and my sister and myself got an affidavit from my distant cousin, which my sister acquired, and [indecipherable] his name was Sam Fuchs, and he sent us an affidavit to come to the United States.

So I went a couple of times there, and so on. And what [indecipherable] really was, that because you didn\u2019t know anyone, you didn't know the language, so you could have [indecipherable] together. But after a very short time, maybe like three months, four months, I somehow decided that that was not for me and that I\u2019m going to try and make fre -- American friends that are local so that I don\u2019t have to go to New York. So I started more or less -- and I met a couple of Jewish boys in Carteret, New Jersey, and we sort of became a little friendly and I went along whether it was to the beach or for pizza. And so slowly, slowly I started getting -- and with American kids saw that I\u2019m European. So I literally -- some [indecipherable] I cut myself off entirely.

I was -- and I was only like 16 on -- going on 17 really, and I was pretty light. So the box were sometimes heavier than I was on the bicycle. But anyway, I did this for quite awhile, til I started driving. I was able to drive, you know, a van, which was like a year, a year and a half later. And I worked, like I mentioned a lot of hours. We worked between 60 to 90 hours a week. Like I worked six days a week from seven to six and I -- two days a week til nine o\u2019clock. And during the night we would go twice a week to the market to pick up vegetables. So it was like between eight oc -- eight p.m. to maybe we\u2019 ll get back two, three a.m., and the next morning we start all over again. So it was qu-quite hectic and I worked like this for a number of years. And --"

You had to co -- if you came in from out of town you had to sort of prove to yourself that -- the townspeople thought they had a monopoly on the town, something li -- it\u2019s just a sentimentality. But I was working in the store there -- once I owned the store and one of the things that was happening to me is that I was not making a lot of money, and -- I backtracked a little -- and I was -- it was getting on my nerves, I was not making a lot of money and I was -- had to deal with a lot of people, they were like Ukrainian or Polish, and they\u2019d come in, I spoke their language, you tried to be nice and they would always accuse you of being a cheat because you were Jewish and so on. So there was certain resentment on my part with certain accusation on their part. And I wasn\u2019t willing to take that garbage because I figured if they don\u2019t like me, too bad, that\u2019s their problem. And I just wouldn\u2019t ba -- put it simply, my tolerance level was not very high [indecipherable] treated and anti-Semitism. So in the meantime, like I say, I\u2019m -- I -- the money wasn\u2019t there and one day I realized that I came to the United States, I wanted to be an American, I want to act like one, I want to speak like one. Here I\u2019m spending most of the time with people that don\u2019t speak English and they are illiterate or -- or very poorly educated and I spend every day with these people and all of a sudden I found out that was not what I wanted.

So, they was both small, Jeffrey must have been like about two years old. And I decided I\u2019ve had it with this and I\u2019m not going to live like I\u2019ve lived it -- like if I was in Europe, I want to live in America. So I wanted to get out of this neighborhood. Besides, I saw there was no -- no future there. So I picked up and I went to California with my wife and children, and by that time my other brother that had come out from Russia was -- also went to Israel with the Haganah from Czechoslovakia. But eventually we brought him out to the United States because it was getting too expensive to upkeep him in Israel, we have to send him money all the time, so we decided to bring him over here. So by that time, that was, I think -- I\u2019m not sure what year it was. But anyway, by that time he was already - we brought him out from Israel to the United States, and -- but he also moved to California because my sister was there. So he settled in California, so when I decided to move, he was already living there, plus I had my other sister there. And when we got there we tried to get an apartment, but in the meantime I had left a lot of loose ends here in New Jersey. So -- because I didn\u2019t empt -- empty out a store and so on. So I had to come back, so I left my wife and my children there, and while I was here settling my affairs, my wife decided she didn\u2019t like it there and she came back -- she got -- hopped on a plane and came back.

And I sit in this particular store for the next 25 years, while my kids were growing up, I sent them through school and so on. So as far as living in general, you know, we tried to live as normal as possible, as any American would.

However, 1n some cases people come, they get big wedding gifts, or they get a start here, they gotta push there. Like I had a friend, he was complaining about his father-in-law [indecipherable], but he would buy him carpeting for the house, or -- or buy him a garage, or whatever, were -- were -- or -- or turned over the business to him, whatever, I didn\u2019t have that.

But it was tough, because the amount of money you made or you\u2019ve been able to keep was very difficult.

And by now the business also was suffering, cause I was in the meat business and the cholesterol thing came on very quickly, very strong, and all of a sudden the demand, plus the competition was just too much to -- to absorb, because the demand just dropped, and -- while the competition was increasing. I was in an area, it was a very competitive area. There was like four or five supermarkets within a couple of miles of me. But for the longest time I held out, but with a reduction of meat consumption, it was going down. So then when the new landlord came in, and he demanded almost triple rent, plus extra added expenses, I just felt I couldn\u2019t afford to stay there. So I retired prematurely; I really wanted to stay in business another four or five years. And- so once -- which worried me, because I didn\u2019t think I could afford it economically.

And I -- I feel that when you get it out there, if you got people that cooperate and they educate and they give them exposure that you get these kids that make -- grow up to be anti -- very big anti-Semites, that they get it from education of certain -- they get certain information that I may -- they will not get at home, but they get it in the school, like in the Catholic school an -- at that, that each time you in -- you inject people like this with a little knowledge, that sooner or later it helps someplace else as they grow up. You know what\u2019s - even if they have a background of anti-Semitism, they already -- they got it in their own school, through good teachers, which I\u2019ve seen some of them are very, very capable.

And a lot of the kids we get in the museum, many times you think of Jewish kids, actually we get kids from Carolinas, from Oklahoma and from that -- kids that never heard of Jews, or -- or never had any - you know. So this way it gives them, instead of thinking of a Jew as a Jew, they think of Jew as person that went through a bad experience. And -- and maybe some of them will understand some of it. So in that respect I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very good thing."

Yet, Iam very Jewish , or I did [indecipherable] I wou- did grow up, it seemed like when I -- where I grew up, everybody was Orthodox and everybody was observant, period. There it was a given, you were Jewish, you were brought up somewhat -- most people were -- were Orthodox and -- and observant, especially in our town, but most people were. In the city you found some people that were maybe wavering a little bit. But I have to ad -- say, we got in -- when we got into a concentration camp, I remember the first holiday right a -- we came -- actually, we came to Mauthausen from Auschwitz, and I remember we were in Mauthausen, this was like about a week after Auschwitz actually, a week or te -- to two weeks after Auschwitz, and it was [indecipherable] because -- I remember that.

I literally, in the beginning, I guess it used to bother me, but after awhile you just learn to live with it and I -- I just never got -- I never thought of religion as -- as an important part of my life, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. And when I lived in Czechoslovakia for a short time after the war, there was no o-organized synagogue or anything that I recall a-at the time, and the government or the -- basically the whole population in general in Czechoslovakia was not exactly a religious type of country like in some countries.

So I\u2019m not exactly -- but some -- but religion really doesn\u2019t play, or never played a big part in my life.

I -- I like the idea that he was chosen, and I respect him, definitely, because I think he\u2019s a capable guy, not because he\u2019s Jewish necessarily, but he has a certain -- he has a good character. But I think they overplayed a little too much, they made a -- a lot to -- too much to do with -- the press in particular, about him being Jewish. And I think sometimes the Jewish community made a big thing to know about him being Jewish. And I have a think on this that all things considered, that he\u2019s Jewish, we know this and a -- but he is -- more, he is running as a citizen of the United States, not as a Jew, so they shouldn\u2019t make such a big issue of him being Jewish. In other words it shouldn\u2019t be -- like if this was in 1900 and they were making a big to-do about him being Jewish, it\u2019s one thing, but you\u2019re talking about 2000, where I think the citizens should be -- he\u2019s a citizen of the United States. So he -- is he running as a Jew, or 1s he running as a citizen? And I think they\u2019re making too much of it, the fact that he is Jewish. And I have to admit, I have mixed feelings because when Jimmy Carter ran, one thing I didn\u2019t like about him 1s because of his religion, because he was a born again. And I thought that was -- like it clouded his thinking in terms of decision making, or whatever. So I should apply the same thing to hi -- to Lieberman. However, whether it\u2019s my own prejudice or what, I think Lieberman is more based -- how can I put it? Grounded, if you will, and Jimmy Carter was more emotionally born again, but -- where Lieberman is more of a -- has a good character, plus he is jew -- he is Orthodox. So maybe there 1s a difference in how I see it, okay? But I don\u2019t like when they stress the Jewish part to the point where they already did. [inaudible]"

And I remember even as a kid I used to find it very, very bothersome to me. And when I saw Hungarian, a lot of Hungarian Jews, not all, a lot of Hungarian Jews, even during the war, a lot of the Hungarians were -- punished them because they were Jewish, and they were doing things to them that they were Jewish. They would always [indecipherable] breast that they\u2019re royal Hungarians, okay, and I found that very, very disgusting to -- 1f you will.

That if you are persecuted and somebody berates you because you\u2019re Jewish, you don\u2019t join them and become one of them because he doesn\u2019t like you to be Jewish. Instead you tell him to go to hell, you know, where I come from, you know. In fact during -- even in the camps, I -- I recall, a lot of the Polish Jews -- like we always had markings where we came from. Like I -- even though I was from Czechoslovakia [indecipherable] we were taken to camp, but from Hungary. We were not from Czechoslovakia. So we had a mark that we came from Hungary, a U for Ungar.

And I was [indecipherable] when I lived among the Hungarian Jews and I moved -- and I went from Hungary, I was -- lived on Hungary.
