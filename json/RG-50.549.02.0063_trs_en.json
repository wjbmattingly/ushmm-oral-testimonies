My grandfather, and my father were running a business, and eventua lly my brothers helped also, alongside. The business was a processing of feathers, and do wn, which they exported from Poland to the United States, and -- and several European countries. And during the peace time, that town was a very small -- I\u2122m not certain how many people, but less than 10,000, and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 3 primarily Jewish.

My -- the reason that I asked you ab out Wodzislaw is that I wondered -- your -- your family had a long history in the town. I wondered if you -- after the war, you felt a sense of connection with the place, if you ever visited again. Anything more about that.",
            "answer": "Yes. The only connection about that town was that I went back to Poland only one time. This was a dozen years ago, more or less. I think maybe more. There was a first march of Holocaust survivors and their children from -- to -- to Auschwitz a-and Birkenau, The March of the Living. And I -- I was one of them, and there were many others from United States, and Canada, even Australia, South Africa. There were about 2,000 young people. College -- college or hi gh school age. And it was a very moving experience. There were very -- dignitaries from Israel, and the former president, Ithzrak Navonne. He ray -- he was s-speaking, you know, to us about it, and it\u2122s -- was extremely moving, and very, very upsetting, of course . Wi-With me went our -- one of our sons, Andrew went wi-with me on that trip, and also one nephew, Ben Belfer, and two ccousins. And we were received by the Polish government, extremely well. They had all kinds of preparations, invited us to the Senate building, gave a coup le parties, you know, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 4 cocktail parties, where we me-met Russian ge -- Russian generals. One of the Russian generals spoke Yiddish. And al so they per -- had a -- performe d a Jewish show in one of their Senate -- what do call them there, Senate building, it was a theater there, a theater building. The show was all done ba -- mostly in -- in -- in Yiddish, Jewish, and some in -- in the -- in Polish. During intermission, I went over to the person who, I was very impressed with her singing. And I ask her ho w did she learn that, she was quite a young person. She says from -- there was a cantor, before World War Two in Poland, and he -- he survived the war, and he had a lot of reco rds, and she learned it from the records, you know. The Polish government gave a special reception, because the following day, I remember, after the -- after they had that big performance, we had -- they invited about 40 people, I was one of them, to the -- the assistant to -- General Yarowzelski, and he gave a whole speech about the Jewish people should come back to Poland, they lived there for a thousand years, and since the Jewish people left -- most of them left, they were -- culturally, and business-wise, and -- and in many other aspect s, you know, were completely eradicated, you know. There\u2122s no -- no industry, the -- and they had -- a matter of fact, ask everyone what type of profession or business, and when I told them what my parents used to do, say, \ufb01Why don\u2122t you come back, we will build a plant, we\u2122ll do this and that.\ufb02 So after he gave a whole big speech, the former president of Israel, Ithzrak Navonne said, \ufb01Too little, too late.\ufb02 He spoke very fluent English. He said, \ufb01What happened,\ufb02 and give all kinds of dates, \ufb01when the Jewish people came back to Poland, as USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 5 they came to their hometowns, what happened to them?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Oh well, it\u2122s a different regime.\ufb02 He asked, during certain da tes, you know, so the -- there were all kinds of ordinances, you know, and if people came to the town, they would -- they were either shot, or they had to flee town, because their homes were occupied by Polish people, and they didn\u2122t want to -- they felt they may want to reclaim their property. So they had to flee. As a matter of fact, a school-mate of mi ne, he and two other people came back to town. Their house was all mostly demolished, but they had no place to stay, they stayed there. So one late afternoon, they knocked at the door, and my friend opened the door, and they shot him. So the other two left, you know. So my memories about it, is I would never want to go back there again. As a matt er of fact, yes, I still remember, when I was there, with my son -- in -- in Wodzislaw, my son and my nephew, my cousins, we -- we rented a -- a car, you know. And we escorted to the cem -- I didn\u2122t remember where the cemetery is -- the Jewish cemetery is. We went to the cemetery, and there was not o-one tombstone [indecipherable] not at all. And th ere was a -- young kids, who were -- they saw a car there, they saw, you know, they saw people dressed differently, whatever. They came over and started -- I said -- you know, we asked him what about the cem -- what happened to the cemetery. They were teenagers, actually. Oh, well they were demolished. And they -- you want to see res -- where the tombstones are? They were -- they made walkways out of them, they made stable s [indecipherable] floors, and so on."

He would go every two weeks to the place, and make sure USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 7 how -- how my parents are, and my -- and the -- and the -- and the sisters, and s -- and the children. And he would give money to that fa mily for food, and other things, whatever. I don\u2122t know how much.

And it became also, very impossible to live there for a couple of months. Was in November, was ve ry cold, they were in -- actually hidden in a bunker, in an orchard garden.

S -- but in Poland, although the Jewish people lived there over a thousand years, as a matter of fact, there\u2122s -- in that small town, Wodzislaw, there\u2122s a synagogue which was ove r a thousand years old. But during the war years, it was -- made a stable out of it, the Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so on. And everything was destroyed. As a matter of fact, I was told it\u2122s being rebuilt now, they want to attract tourism, and so on, different parts of Poland, yeah. The -- the Polish people in particular are very, very anti-Semitic, and I -- and how can I -- I can explain it is, my own family and I had an experience, although we were very respected citizens. When the Germans came in, the first day they came in, they knocked at every -- they were shooting in front of your house, and th ere were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so on. We were -- we were hiding in a warehouse that we owned. And finally they came to our door, they were steel doors, they were banging and shooting, and -- and calling in German, \ufb01Get out, you [indecipherable] get out .\ufb02 You know, and eventually we had to get out. They were beating us, and we had to run to a square . And then, they shot several people, put some houses on fire. So people didn\u2122t come out, they put them on fire. And we are all this -- on that square they [indecipherable] on us, several -- maybe it\u2122s couple thousand, or several thousand people. Then th ey left. So once they left, my parents felt th-these were the first ones coming in, they were -- had tanks, you know, that we heard. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 11 So what -- my parents said, \ufb01Let\u2122s go to the church, there\u2122s a church nearby.\ufb02 And we were there only minutes, I don\u2122t know, less than a half hour. The priest himself, in charge, he said, \ufb01You Belfers, you zhid -- you Jews,\ufb02 you know, \ufb01get out.\ufb02 And actually pushed us out, you know. Said , [indecipherable]. So we ran to -- we had an uncle, you know, who lived outside -- a little far out -- outs -- outside town. We stayed there for overnight, a couple nights, I don\u2122t remember, a few days, you know. I t calmed down, so we went back to the house. We got -- we got no help, really, to speak of. Not only that, I know of cas es who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the area, but if a neighbor would know, or found out, that they being hidden, they would report them, you know? And the people, not only the Jewish people got either shot, or sent to a concentration camp, or whatever, but also the Gentile. But there was no -- there were -- the Germans got only cooperation from everyone. The church leaders in particular, and it was a bad, bad time, and I can\u2122t explain it even nowadays, why there should be such hate in a -- in some people\u2122s mind towards the Jewish people. The Jewish people have contributed a lot, not only in -- in Poland, everywh -- everywhere they lived, in -- in many fields, whether it\u2122s medicine, or whether it\u2122s engineering, or -- or -- or so many other important fields. But obviously it goes back so many years, it goes back to -- it goes back to a thousand years, claiming that th ings that we did to Christ, which is a lie, and even the ner -- the -- the New Testament is not very accurate. Even the Pope recently stated that. And as far as Jesus, he was a Jew, he died as a Jew, and he was not killed by USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 12 the Jewish people, he was killed by the Romans. He may have -- may have -- he may have wanted to do some reforming, or wh atever. But why they -- why -- it\u2122s 2,000 years later, why is this being taught, or when -- or when -- that\u2122s why there\u2122s that hate builds up, from childhood. They go to churches, they\u2122re [indecipherable] Jews, or other references to Jew, although it has been removed now from the liturgy, I -- I hope that futu -- future generations will not ever have to experience difficulties and obstructions in -- of justice and everything, because they have one religion, or another religion. I don\u2122t -- I don\u2122t believe one religion\u2122s better than the other, they\u2122re all the same, they all teach you to be a better person. They don\u2122t teach you to hate. And that\u2122s -- that\u2122s my message, in a way."

Then I have a brother Maurice, wh o survived the war wi -- with me. But he -- he passed away, unfortunately, let\u2122s say about -- almost 20 years ago, yeah. He was much more affected from the war years than I was. He -- his wife and a child, the child was only three or four years old, maybe three y ears old, was in hiding near Krak\u00f3w, also some Christian friends. And one day she we nt shopping to -- for groceries, you know, with the child. She didn\u2122t look specifically Jewish, you know? She spoke very fluent Polish, and all that, like -- like a native, of c ourse. Somebody reported to the police while she was walking out of the store. They waited for her, and shot her right -- right there, because she started to cry and protest. The child, we don\u2122t know. There -- there was a witness that we met, after the war, told us that he was -- he didn\u2122t -- he -- he didn\u2122t actually see it, but he was in the same town, hiding, and he -- he was told that the child had just walked away, or what ever. Somebody may have take n the child, they don\u2122t know what happened. I\u2122ve done a lot of investigation, we can\u2122t find any trace of it. And the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 16 reason I -- we did some investigation, in po - in Warsaw, there's a hotel called Belfer. I thought, maybe, you never know, you know. I -- through the Red Cross, then through friends of mine who were in Poland. When I was in Poland, I didn\u2122t -- I wasn\u2122t aware of that. May have been built after, when I was in Poland with that mission, you know, to [indecipherable] I was told by the Re-Red Cross in a letter, and also by some friends subsequently, that the reason the hotel is called Belfer, Belfer in poli -- in -- i -- they -- in school, they called it Belfer like a nickname. Professor they called a Belfer. It\u2122s a pension fund for teachers, and they have investment there, and that\u2122s why it\u2122s all -- called Belfer. There\u2122s no relationship. I was about to s-s -- aba -- was Maurice, and I had a -- a sister called Sheindla, or Sheindo. Schein means pretty, beautiful, you know, it\u2122s -- and sh -- she must have been eight -- seven or eight ye ars older than I am -- than I was. She was a very beautiful girl, very, very intelligent, and very high marks always a s -- in school, she always was the top of the class. Then I had another si-sister, Helena, or Hya. She -- she must have been only two years older than I am . Two or three, I\u2122m not sure. She also was a lovely, lovely girl, and they all are actually -- what -- what tragically happened to my sisters, they -- the three sisters, they were in camp wi-with -- with my parents, an-and me, and -- and Maurice, in Plasz\u00f3w -- in Krak\u00f3w, the concentration camp, Plasz\u00f3w. And after being there a year, more or less, they were -- all the women were taken out. We didn\u2122t know where or what. My mother, and my sisters. And one child of -- of -- of my sister Mindla, she -- her name was Sarah, the little child, and she was maybe eight years old, or USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 17 so. First they took -- there were several hidden children, she was one of them. First they took the children out, then the women, we didn\u2122t know where, what, you know. They always would tell you, \ufb01Oh, they\u2122re going to a much better camp, and much easier ts -- it\u2122s overcrowded here.\ufb02 They had all kinds -- they had a -- schemes developed to fool y -- us. We had not -- we tried to believe, we had no choice, you know? But not believing was worse. But after the war, when we were liberated, we tried to contact -- we met different people in different areas, in different cam ps, you know, we went to Salzburg, and -- and it\u2122s in my tapes, I went to Italy, but I came -- from Italy, I went back to Munich. I heard in Munich there were big gathering of surv ivors, you know, from all over Germany, you know, Austria. And when I came there, I met some people. And they told me that they all were sent to Auschwitz. But subsequently , maybe a -- months, or a year later, was a woman who was a sis -- a friend of my younger sister Helena, and she said, \ufb01I was with your three sisters in Denya -- Diensk -- that -- Polish ports, one is German, one is Polish. Your sisters were there, and I was there, and only days -- ma -- a we ek or less before the Russians came into that section of Poland, they put -- they told the people they -- they had pr -- factories, they were the -- sewing uniforms, they told them that they going to be exchanged for German prisoner of war in Sweden. They gave everybody a piece of bread, and tried to calm -- this was a way of calmi ng, you know? Put them -- loaded them on boats, very a -- packed them in like in cattle cars, you know, the same way. And they say going to Sweden, but they torp edoed all the boats. We don\u2122t know, there could be 10,000 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 18 of them. Only about a hundred were left to clean up, and th -- one of the hundred was that friend of my sister, yeah."

            "answer": "It was extremely important, because we -- we felt -- I felt that they liberated the land that th-the -- that the Arabs felt is their land, but if you go back in history, a lot of it belonged to Israel. And even now, the disput e about the Gaza Strip, and other areas, you know, that belong to Israel, but Israel is not a state.

Iraq, you know? They depressed -- they oppressed the people, and they live like -- all the leaders in these countries li-live like kings. You see them when you go to Europe, in some hotels, I\u2122ve met some -- I was in Switzer land maybe 10 years ago. They take entire floors, they come with a whole crew, you k now, they all -- a cook, and help, and what USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 46 they love most, I\u2122ve seen, th ey go to gambling casinos. They gamble maybe thousands, or millions, who knows? They just -- the disgrace of their own people; instead of building them up, they build themselves up, the leaders themselves. It\u2122s unfortunate. Also the market, let\u2122s say, the Arab -- because of the standard of living there, their wages are so low by comparison to Israel, or by com -- comp arison to European\u2122s standards. And even s -- Far East -- the Far East was -- China, or any of these countries, exporting a lot of goods to the United States, because their labor is extremely -- 10 cents an hour. In the Arab countries some ma -- don\u2122t make more, they\u2122re making less. They could build up their economies, like Japan did after World War two, and othe rs, with the help of the Israelis, but they -- their leaders are fighting, not even knowing what their -- they want, and every [indecipherable] they make, they don\u2122t live up to, you know, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s a constant problem. I hope the new generation will understand that better, be more educated, more broadminded, and there\u2122ll be peace in that area, and by having peace in that area, will be peace also in many other areas, because we are interrelated in a way, one country with a -- with another.

Now, they don\u2122t do it. Plus, we also helped building the Kravitz Center, which is a -- a place where they -- they have operas, and they have shows, and -- and all that, and I -- I think it was mostly Christian and Jewish, but a big -- I -- I -- I would say at le -- more than half the money came from Jewish people. There\u2122s a little more -- more culture. I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 69 would say they contributed money to the -- to small museums, and s -- and now the Jews, and the Gentiles work together in all these places, so it\u2122s -- it\u2122s a very good relation.

They -- they must have bribed some Italian who were in charge of -- they went by -- in Krak\u00f3w they used to stop, for some reason or another. So what they would do, they wo uld get uniforms, and bandaged up, let\u2122s say like -- a guy like me, they put [indecipherable] bandaged up, and make believe you can\u2122t talk.

That\u2122s what I -- my parents and my brother felt, let somebody at least get out, so they -- maybe you\u2122ll be able to get in touch with Arthur in the United States, and so on.

He di -- I was hesitating a little bit, for one reason, but he definitely wanted to go. I wanted -- what we wanted to do is, we wanted to -- we -- we marked up where they shot my father, and they -- they left him there, and then we buried him. We -- we measured how f -- how many feet from that tree to this tree, to this location, that location. And there were two other men [indecipherable] put them in that burial place, not just -- so my father came to me, he said, \ufb01Don\u2122t come.
