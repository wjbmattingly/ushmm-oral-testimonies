My grandfather, and my father were running a business, and eventually my brothers helped also, alongside. The business was a processing of feathers, and down, which they exported from Poland to the United States, and -- and several European countries. And during the peace time, that town was a very small -- I\u2019m not certain how many people, but less than 10,000, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Yes. The only connection about that town was that I went back to Poland only one time. This was a dozen years ago, more or less. I think maybe more. There was a first march of Holocaust survivors and their children from -- to -- to Auschwitz a-and Birkenau, The March of the Living. And I -- I was one of them, and there were many others from United States, and Canada, even Australia, South Africa. There were about 2,000 young people. College -- college or high school age. And it was a very moving experience. There were very -- dignitaries from Israel, and the former president, Ithzrak Navonne. He ray -- he was s-speaking, you know, to us about it, and it\u2019s -- was extremely moving, and very, very upsetting, of course. Wi-With me went our -- one of our sons, Andrew went wi-with me on that trip, and also one nephew, Ben Belfer, and two c- cousins. And we were received by the Polish government, extremely well. They had all kinds of preparations, invited us to the Senate building, gave a couple parties, you know, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

One of the Russian generals spoke Yiddish. And also they per -- had a -- performed a Jewish show in one of their Senate -- what do call them there, Senate building, it was a theater there, a theater building. The show was all done ba -- mostly in -- in -- in Yiddish, Jewish, and some in -- in the -- in Polish. During intermission, I went over to the person who, I was very impressed with her singing. And I ask her how did she learn that, she was quite a young person. She says from -- there was a cantor, before World War Two in Poland, and he -- he survived the war, and he had a lot of records, and she learned it from the records, you know. The Polish government gave a special reception, because the following day, I remember, after the -- after they had that big performance, we had -- they invited about 40 people, I was one of them, to the -- the assistant to -- General Yarowzelski, and he gave a whole speech about the Jewish people should come back to Poland, they lived there for a thousand years, and since the Jewish people left -- most of them left, they were- culturally, and business-wise, and -- and in many other aspects, you know, were completely eradicated, you know. There\u2019s no -- no industry, the -- and they had -- a matter of fact, ask everyone what type of profession or business, and when I told them what my parents used to do, say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back, we will build a plant, we\u2019ll do this and that.\u201d So after he gave a whole big speech, the former president of Israel, Ithzrak Navonne said, \u201cToo little, too late.\u201d He spoke very fluent English. He said, \u201cWhat happened,\u201d and give all kinds of dates, \u201cwhen the Jewish people came back to Poland, as This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So they had to flee. As a matter of fact, a school-mate of mine, he and two other people came back to town. Their house was all mostly demolished, but they had no place to stay, they stayed there. So one late afternoon, they knocked at the door, and my friend opened the door, and they shot him. So the other two left, you know. So my memories about it, is I would never want to go back there again. As a matter of fact, yes, I still remember, when I was there, with my son -- in -- in Wodzislaw, my son and my nephew, my cousins, we -- we rented a -- a car, you know. And we escorted to the cem -- I didn\u2019t remember where the cemetery is -- the Jewish cemetery is. We went to the cemetery, and there was not o-one tombstone [indecipherable] not at all. And there was a -- young kids, who were -- they saw a car there, they saw, you know, they saw people dressed differently, whatever. They came over and started -- I said -- you know, we asked him what about the cem -- what happened to the cemetery. They were teenagers, actually. Oh, well they were demolished.

S -- but in Poland, although the Jewish people lived there over a thousand years, as a matter of fact, there\u2019s -- in that small town, Wodzislaw, there\u2019s a synagogue which was over a thousand years old. But during the war years, it was -- made a stable out of it, the Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so on. And everything was destroyed. As a matter of fact, I was told it\u2019s being rebuilt now, they want to attract tourism, and so on, different parts of Poland, yeah. The -- the Polish people in particular are very, very anti-Semitic, and I -- and how can I -- I can explain it is, my own family and I had an experience, although we were very respected citizens. When the Germans came in, the first day they came in, they knocked at every -- they were shooting in front of your house, and there were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so on. We were -- we were hiding in a warehouse that we owned.

They were beating us, and we had to run to a square. And then, they shot several people, put some houses on fire. So people didn\u2019t come out, they put them on fire. And we are all this -- on that square they [indecipherable] on us, several -- maybe it\u2019s couple thousand, or several thousand people. Then they left.

The priest himself, in charge, he said, \u201cYou Belfers, you zhid -- you Jews,\u201d you know, \u201cget out.\u201d And actually pushed us out, you know. Said, [indecipherable]. So we ran to -- we had an uncle, you know, who lived outside -- a little far out -- outs -- outside town. We stayed there for overnight, a couple nights, I don\u2019t remember, a few days, you know. I t calmed down, so we went back to the house. We got -- we got no help, really, to speak of. Not only that, I know of cases who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the area, but if a neighbor would know, or found out, that they being hidden, they would report them, you know? And the people, not only the Jewish people got either shot, or sent to a concentration camp, or whatever, but also the Gentile. But there was no -- there were -- the Germans got only cooperation from everyone. The church leaders in particular, and it was a bad, bad time, and I can\u2019t explain it even nowadays, why there should be such hate 1n a -- in some people\u2019s mind towards the Jewish people. The Jewish people have contributed a lot, not only in -- in Poland, everywh -- everywhere they lived, in -- in many fields, whether it\u2019s medicine, or whether it\u2019s engineering, or -- or -- or so many other important fields. But obviously it goes back so many years, it goes back to -- it goes back to a thousand years, claiming that things that we did to Christ, which is a lie, and even the ner -- the -- the New Testament is not very accurate. Even the Pope recently stated that. And as far as Jesus, he was a Jew, he died as a Jew, and he was not killed by This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He may have -- may have -- he may have wanted to do some reforming, or whatever. But why they -- why -- it\u2019s 2,000 years later, why is this being taught, or when -- or when -- that\u2019s why there\u2019s that hate builds up, from childhood. They go to churches, they\u2019re [indecipherable] Jews, or other references to Jew, although it has been removed now from the liturgy, I -- I hope that futu- future generations will not ever have to experience difficulties and obstructions in -- of justice and everything, because they have one religion, or another religion. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t believe one religion\u2019s better than the other, they\u2019re all the same, they all teach you to be a better person. They don\u2019t teach you to hate.
