This is tape number one, side A, and this is a follow up interview to a videotaped interview that was conducted with Mr. Belfer, in 1995. So, let\u2019s begin by -- I\u2019m just going to correct a mistake, it was -- the first interview with Mr. Belfer was done on May 31\u201c, 1996, on videotape. Okay. I wanted to start by asking you a little bit more, going back to before the war. I wanted to ask you about your hometown, Wodzislaw?",

            "answer": "We live in that town, my aunts, and my -- not only my parents, my grandparents were born there. And we were ver -- respected citizens of that town. My grandfather, and my father were running a business, and eventually my brothers helped also, alongside. The business was a processing of feathers, and down, which they exported from Poland to the United States, and -- and several European countries. And during the peace time, that town was a very small -- I\u2019m not certain how many people, but less than 10,000, and 63 3 primarily Jewish. And I -- I lived there for my first, let\u2019s say 12\" -- 12 years or so. Subsequently, I moved to Krakow."

            "question": "-- because I don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to repeat what you talked about in the video. My -- the reason that I asked you about Wodzislaw is that I wondered -- your -- your family had a long history in the town. I wondered if you -- after the war, you felt a sense of connection with the place, if you ever visited again. Anything more about that.",
            "answer": "Yes. The only connection about that town was that I went back to Poland only one time. This was a dozen years ago, more or less. I think maybe more. There was a first march of Holocaust survivors and their children from -- to -- to Auschwitz a-and Birkenau, The March of the Living. And I -- I was one of them, and there were many others from United States, and Canada, even Australia, South Africa. There were about 2,000 young people. College -- college or high school age. And it was a very moving experience. There were very -- dignitaries from Israel, and the former president, Ithzrak Navonne. He ray -- he was s-speaking, you know, to us about it, and it\u2019s -- was extremely moving, and very, very upsetting, of course. Wi-With me went our -- one of our sons, Andrew went wi-with me on that trip, and also one nephew, Ben Belfer, and two c- cousins. And we were received by the Polish government, extremely well. They had all kinds of preparations, invited us to the Senate building, gave a couple parties, you know, 63 4 cocktail parties, where we me-met Russian ge -- Russian generals. One of the Russian generals spoke Yiddish. And also they per -- had a -- performed a Jewish show in one of their Senate -- what do call them there, Senate building, it was a theater there, a theater building. The show was all done ba -- mostly in -- in -- in Yiddish, Jewish, and some in -- in the -- in Polish. During intermission, I went over to the person who, I was very impressed with her singing. And I ask her how did she learn that, she was quite a young person. She says from -- there was a cantor, before World War Two in Poland, and he -- he survived the war, and he had a lot of records, and she learned it from the records, you know. The Polish government gave a special reception, because the following day, I remember, after the -- after they had that big performance, we had -- they invited about 40 people, I was one of them, to the -- the assistant to -- General Yarowzelski, and he gave a whole speech about the Jewish people should come back to Poland, they lived there for a thousand years, and since the Jewish people left -- most of them left, they were- culturally, and business-wise, and -- and in many other aspects, you know, were completely eradicated, you know. There\u2019s no -- no industry, the -- and they had -- a matter of fact, ask everyone what type of profession or business, and when I told them what my parents used to do, say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back, we will build a plant, we\u2019ll do this and that.\u201d So after he gave a whole big speech, the former president of Israel, Ithzrak Navonne said, \u201cToo little, too late.\u201d He spoke very fluent English. He said, \u201cWhat happened,\u201d and give all kinds of dates, \u201cwhen the Jewish people came back to Poland, as 63 5 they came to their hometowns, what happened to them?\u201d He said, \u201cOh well, it\u2019s a different regime.\u201d He asked, during certain dates, you know, so the -- there were all kinds of ordinances, you know, and if people came to the town, they would -- they were either shot, or they had to flee town, because their homes were occupied by Polish people, and they didn\u2019t want to -- they felt they may want to reclaim their property. So they had to flee. As a matter of fact, a school-mate of mine, he and two other people came back to town. Their house was all mostly demolished, but they had no place to stay, they stayed there. So one late afternoon, they knocked at the door, and my friend opened the door, and they shot him. So the other two left, you know. So my memories about it, is I would never want to go back there again. As a matter of fact, yes, I still remember, when I was there, with my son -- in -- in Wodzislaw, my son and my nephew, my cousins, we -- we rented a -- a car, you know. And we escorted to the cem -- I didn\u2019t remember where the cemetery is -- the Jewish cemetery is. We went to the cemetery, and there was not o-one tombstone [indecipherable] not at all. And there was a -- young kids, who were -- they saw a car there, they saw, you know, they saw people dressed differently, whatever. They came over and started -- I said -- you know, we asked him what about the cem -- what happened to the cemetery. They were teenagers, actually. Oh, well they were demolished. And they -- you want to see res -- where the tombstones are? They were -- they made walkways out of them, they made stables [indecipherable] floors, and so on."

He would go every two weeks to the place, and make sure 63 7 how -- how my parents are, and my -- and the -- and the -- and the sisters, and s -- and the children. And he would give money to that family for food, and other things, whatever. I don\u2019t know how much. My father felt 1f he has a money with him [indecipherable] the money wasn\u2019t so much valuable any more, but they would keep some jewelry, or some gold coins, or whatever, just for emergency. He was afraid that if he gives it all in one time, maybe the guy -- they were na -- she was always so -- they weren\u2019t sure, maybe, he would get tired of us. And it became also, very impossible to live there for a couple of months. Was in November, was very cold, they were in -- actually hidden in a bunker, in an orchard garden. And two little children, they were tall -- they were taught not to speak, and not to cry or anything. It was quite a horrible scene."

And subsequently, one of my brothers worked there. That -- he felt 1f he helps them and -- and so on, he will survive -- it\u2019Il be easier for him to survive the war, you know.

            "answer": "Positively, I wa -- I -- am -- definitely would trust -- it\u2019s a different system, you know, in the United States, it\u2019s a democratic system, and every citizen has it\u2019s rights, and the Constitution protects every cit-citizen. S -- but in Poland, although the Jewish people lived there over a thousand years, as a matter of fact, there\u2019s -- in that small town, Wodzislaw, there\u2019s a synagogue which was over a thousand years old. But during the war years, it was -- made a stable out of it, the Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so on. And everything was destroyed. As a matter of fact, I was told it\u2019s being rebuilt now, they want to attract tourism, and so on, different parts of Poland, yeah. The -- the Polish people in particular are very, very anti-Semitic, and I -- and how can I -- I can explain it is, my own family and I had an experience, although we were very respected citizens. When the Germans came in, the first day they came in, they knocked at every -- they were shooting in front of your house, and there were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so on. We were -- we were hiding in a warehouse that we owned. And finally they came to our door, they were steel doors, they were banging and shooting, and -- and calling in German, \u201cGet out, you [indecipherable] get out.\u201d You know, and eventually we had to get out. They were beating us, and we had to run to a square. And then, they shot several people, put some houses on fire. So people didn\u2019t come out, they put them on fire. And we are all this -- on that square they [indecipherable] on us, several -- maybe it\u2019s couple thousand, or several thousand people. Then they left. So once they left, my parents felt th-these were the first ones coming in, they were -- had tanks, you know, that we heard. 63 11 So what -- my parents said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the church, there\u2019s a church nearby.\u201d And we were there only minutes, I don\u2019t know, less than a half hour. The priest himself, in charge, he said, \u201cYou Belfers, you zhid -- you Jews,\u201d you know, \u201cget out.\u201d And actually pushed us out, you know. Said, [indecipherable]. So we ran to -- we had an uncle, you know, who lived outside -- a little far out -- outs -- outside town. We stayed there for overnight, a couple nights, I don\u2019t remember, a few days, you know. I t calmed down, so we went back to the house. We got -- we got no help, really, to speak of. Not only that, I know of cases who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the area, but if a neighbor would know, or found out, that they being hidden, they would report them, you know? And the people, not only the Jewish people got either shot, or sent to a concentration camp, or whatever, but also the Gentile. But there was no -- there were -- the Germans got only cooperation from everyone. The church leaders in particular, and it was a bad, bad time, and I can\u2019t explain it even nowadays, why there should be such hate 1n a -- in some people\u2019s mind towards the Jewish people. The Jewish people have contributed a lot, not only in -- in Poland, everywh -- everywhere they lived, in -- in many fields, whether it\u2019s medicine, or whether it\u2019s engineering, or -- or -- or so many other important fields. But obviously it goes back so many years, it goes back to -- it goes back to a thousand years, claiming that things that we did to Christ, which is a lie, and even the ner -- the -- the New Testament is not very accurate. Even the Pope recently stated that. And as far as Jesus, he was a Jew, he died as a Jew, and he was not killed by 63 12 the Jewish people, he was killed by the Romans. He may have -- may have -- he may have wanted to do some reforming, or whatever. But why they -- why -- it\u2019s 2,000 years later, why is this being taught, or when -- or when -- that\u2019s why there\u2019s that hate builds up, from childhood. They go to churches, they\u2019re [indecipherable] Jews, or other references to Jew, although it has been removed now from the liturgy, I -- I hope that futu- future generations will not ever have to experience difficulties and obstructions in -- of justice and everything, because they have one religion, or another religion. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t believe one religion\u2019s better than the other, they\u2019re all the same, they all teach you to be a better person. They don\u2019t teach you to hate. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s my message, in a way."

And s -- she -- let\u2019s see, was two years, or one year younger than Arthur, yeah. I would say, she must have been 15 years older, or 14. 14 or 15 years. Then I have a brother Maurice, who survived the war wi -- with me. But he -- he passed away, unfortunately, let\u2019s say about -- almost 20 years ago, yeah. He was much more affected from the war years than I was. He -- his wife and a child, the child was only three or four years old, maybe three years old, was in hiding near Krakow, also some Christian friends. And one day she went shopping to -- for groceries, you know, with the child. She didn\u2019t look specifically Jewish, you know? She spoke very fluent Polish, and all that, like -- like a native, of course. Somebody reported to the police while she was walking out of the store. They waited for her, and shot her right -- right there, because she started to cry and protest. The child, we don\u2019t know. There -- there was a witness that we met, after the war, told us that he was -- he didn\u2019t -- he -- he didn\u2019t actually see it, but he was in the same town, hiding, and he -- he was told that the child had just walked away, or whatever. Somebody may have taken the child, they don\u2019t know what happened. I\u2019ve done a lot of investigation, we can\u2019t find any trace of it. And the 63 16 reason I -- we did some investigation, in po -- in Warsaw, there's a hotel called Belfer. I thought, maybe, you never know, you know. I -- through the Red Cross, then through friends of mine who were in Poland. When I was in Poland, I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t aware of that. May have been built after, when I was in Poland with that mission, you know, to [indecipherable] I was told by the Re-Red Cross in a letter, and also by some friends subsequently, that the reason the hotel is called Belfer, Belfer in poli -- in -- 1 -- they -- in school, they called it Belfer like a nickname. Professor they called a Belfer. It\u2019s a pension fund for teachers, and they have investment there, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s all -- called Belfer. There\u2019s no relationship. I was about to s-s -- aba -- was Maurice, and I had a -- a sister called Sheindla, or Sheindo. Schein means pretty, beautiful, you know, it\u2019s -- and sh -- she must have been eight -- seven or eight years older than I am -- than I was. She was a very beautiful girl, very, very intelligent, and very high marks always a s -- in school, she always was the top of the class. Then I had another si-sister, Helena, or Hya. She -- she must have been only two years older than I am. Two or three, I\u2019m not sure. She also was a lovely, lovely girl, and they all are actually -- what -- what tragically happened to my sisters, they -- the three sisters, they were in camp wi-with -- with my parents, an-and me, and -- and Maurice, in Plaszow -- in Krakow, the concentration camp, Plaszow. And after being there a year, more or less, they were -- all the women were taken out. We didn\u2019t know where or what. My mother, and my sisters. And one child of -- of -- of my sister Mindla, she -- her name was Sarah, the little child, and she was maybe eight years old, or 63 17 so. First they took -- there were several hidden children, she was one of them. First they took the children out, then the women, we didn\u2019t know where, what, you know. They always would tell you, \u201cOh, they\u2019re going to a much better camp, and much easier ts -- it\u2019s overcrowded here.\u201d They had all kinds -- they had a -- schemes developed to fool y -- us. We had not -- we tried to believe, we had no choice, you know? But not believing was worse. But after the war, when we were liberated, we tried to contact -- we met different people in different areas, in different camps, you know, we went to Salzburg, and -- and it\u2019s in my tapes, I went to Italy, but I came -- from Italy, I went back to Munich. I heard in Munich there were big gathering of survivors, you know, from all over Germany, you know, Austria. And when I came there, I met some people. And they told me that they all were sent to Auschwitz. But subsequently, maybe a -- months, or a year later, was a woman who was a sis -- a friend of my younger sister Helena, and she said, \u201cI was with your three sisters in Denya -- Diensk -- that -- Polish ports, one 1s German, one is Polish. Your sisters were there, and I was there, and only days -- ma -- a week or less before the Russians came into that section of Poland, they put -- they told the people they -- they had pr -- factories, they were the -- sewing uniforms, they told them that they going to be exchanged for German prisoner of war in Sweden. They gave everybody a piece of bread, and tried to calm -- this was a way of calming, you know? Put them -- loaded them on boats, very a -- packed them in like in cattle cars, you know, the same way. And they say going to Sweden, but they torpedoed all the boats. We don\u2019t know, there could be 10,000 63 18 of them. Only about a hundred were left to clean up, and th -- one of the hundred was that friend of my sister, yeah."

This officer wrote to Hotel Broadway in New York, and asked whether or no -- whether a name by the -- Arthur Belfer, his name was Artur, but he changed it to Arthur, you know. So, a letter came back, and it -- but -- I wrote the letter, and I told him, we are here, we are -- we survive, we\u2019re -- and we don\u2019t know whether anybody else survived.

They said -- because we -- the reason we went to Italy -- I wanted to go to Israel, and they told us then, the UNRRA had offices of people, you know. People like you who he -- look healthy, and young, you most likely will be intercepted by the British, you know, and the -- when you go by boat, and they send you to Cyprus, because they -- they send a lot of people to Cyprus.

Iraq, you know? They depressed -- they oppressed the people, and they live like -- all the leaders in these countries li-live like kings. You see them when you go to Europe, in some hotels, I\u2019ve met some -- I was in Switzerland maybe 10 years ago. They take entire floors, they come with a whole crew, you know, they all -- a cook, and help, and what 63 46 they love most, I\u2019ve seen, they go to gambling casinos. They gamble maybe thousands, or millions, who knows? They just -- the disgrace of their own people; instead of building them up, they build themselves up, the leaders themselves. It\u2019s unfortunate. Also the market, let\u2019s say, the Arab -- because of the standard of living there, their wages are so low by comparison to Israel, or by com -- comparison to European\u2019s standards. And even s -- Far East -- the Far East was -- China, or any of these countries, exporting a lot of goods to the United States, because their labor is extremely -- 10 cents an hour. In the Arab countries some ma -- don\u2019t make more, they\u2019re making less. They could build up their economies, like Japan did after World War two, and others, with the help of the Israelis, but they -- their leaders are fighting, not even knowing what their -- they want, and every [indecipherable] they make, they don\u2019t live up to, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a constant problem. I hope the new generation will understand that better, be more educated, more broadminded, and there\u2019Il be peace in that area, and by having peace in that area, will be peace also in many other areas, because we are interrelated in a way, one country with a -- with another.

He went on a vacation -- not actually on vacation, he went to fee - Eleanor -- Eleanor, my wife, Eleanor has a sister in Phoenix, and she had -- she has two sons, they were -- and -- and James, and Andrew were very close to their sons, they were a similar age, only a couple years -- the others were a couple of years younger. When their son George was accepted at University of Colorado, and Eleanor\u2019s sister called up Jim, he was very -- George was very close to Jim, he said, \u201cYou know my -- my husband George,\u201d senior, okay, \u201cwould like to take little George,\u201d they call him, \u201cto -- to college, but he has business appointments, and it\u2019s difficult for him to go away.

One day, Jim called us up on Friday night, to tell us that -- when he\u2019s coming back from Colorado, which plane on -- on Sunday, because he had to start school, you know? He went to University of Pennsylvania War-Warton school. He was a year ahead in school, you know, very bright. Come [indecipherable] on Saturday, at four -- four o\u2019clock or so, we got a call from Colorado, or from Phoenix. From Phoenix, probably, that Jimmy drowned. What happened 1s, Jim took George to college, to the university. Then th-they 63 63 rented bicycles, and they drove to a waterway nearby, a few miles away. The waterway had coves for swimmers, and the buoys, you know, that separate the waterway from the coves were not -- weren\u2019t there, because there was a storm a coup -- few days before. So a boat -- while Jimmy went swimming laps around the cove, a boat came in. There were - there were other kids swimming, a little further, he may have been 20 yards, 10 yards, I don\u2019t know, away from, cause you know, he was an a -- he was on the swimming team, as a matter of fact, at the University of Pennsylvania, so -- boat came in, he saw the boat coming in, he took a dive. When he heard the boat passed, he came up, so that he didn\u2019t realize that the skier -- the skier was a woman, she hit him in the head, and he -- he drowned. They thought he took another dive. And the boat never stopped. And he drowned. And you asked -- we had depositions, we asked the husband and wife. First of all, on that waterway, they had to sign a statement that they can be only in the waterway, they cannot go into the coves. He violated that. Then, we were in a conference room, I would say less wide than this room, about a little longer, but narrower. We\u2019re sitting at a conference table, and there was a -- a pic -- a painting on the wall. So my attorney asked her, because she was wearing thick glasses, \u201cCan you tell me what you see in this picture?\u201d She said no. \u201cOkay, are these reading glasses?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, these for distance, and sum -- I can\u2019t read with them, they\u2019re mostly for distance.\u201d \u201cYou cannot identify the picture?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDid you wear these glasses while you were skiing, while you on the skis?\u201d She says no. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wear the glasses?\u201d \u201cI would lose them, 63 64 they would fall off.\u201d She thought it was a dog swimming.

Now, they don\u2019t do it. Plus, we also helped building the Kravitz Center, which 1s a -- a place where they -- they have operas, and they have shows, and -- and all that, and I -- I think it was mostly Christian and Jewish, but a big -- I -- I -- I would say at le -- more than half the money came from Jewish people. There\u2019s a little more -- more culture. I 63 69 would say they contributed money to the -- to small museums, and s -- and now the Jews, and the Gentiles work together in all these places, so it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very good relation. Once a year they have a ball for the -- for the hospital, you know?
