My father had a very unusual profession for a Jew. His father had been a butcher. They -- usually the Jewish butcher was also the butcher for the other population. In other words, he served the whole community. Of course, the Jews ate the kosher parts and so on. I had never known my grandfather because he died of some gangrene he had of his leg -- he had a leg amputated, because I\u2019m told that he had diabetes, but I -- I really never knew him. And my father had only one sister, who died when she was probably about 18 or so, of complication of probably appendicitis, which know how to treat. But her name was Margaret. So, my middle name is Margaret. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m Simone Margaret. And also Heb-Hebrew name would mean Esther, so I\u2019m Esther too, in my Hebrew name. The interesting thing is, is that I\u2019d always thought that I was named Simone because it\u2019s a real French name and Alsace had just returned to France in 1918. My parents were married in 1919 and I was born in 1920. And then I found out when -- more recently I\u2019ve been studying genealogy and I have the genealogy of the Weils all the way back to way before the French revolution, I have investigated that.

They were a very poor family in the village and he used to help his father in -- in the butcher shop, but he eventually developed an interest in sheep and sheep raising and sheep breeding and for the meat and for the and developed a big, big business. He became the most important sheep breeder in the east of France and although we lived in the city, he had these herds of sheep, I guess that\u2019s what they are, in the various places where he went and then he supervised all this -- this big business. I had very little interest in that. My mother also had very little education, although probably more than my father."

You see, when the war started, I was li -- I was 19 years old, but the year before, really, we -- Munich was happening and we were very worried, because Strasbourg is the most exposed city. And so my parents asked me to take my grandmother away from Strasbourg and in transcript -- in -- I -- I read that I took my -- I went to safety with my grandmother and the interpretation was that I went to be safe with my grandmother. What really happened is that I took responsibility for my grandmother and I took a train and I went to some kind of resort, to wait until things were settling down in -- in the whole world situation and then brought my grandmother back to Strassber -- the following year, when the war really was going to get started, same thing happened. I was away, my father brought me back home. This is end of August, 1939 and again I took my grandmother, we took a train. We went to the center of France where we stayed in a hotel and I took my grandmother to safety, I didn\u2019t go to safety with my grandmother. So, this is one of the things that, as I say, I took responsibility for my grandmother and we waited out [indecipherable].

Both my parents came, but my mother -- of the two -- of my parents, my mother was the more knowledgeable. She -- really amazingly, for a woman in those days, could understand the prayer book, could understand the Biblical text. My father could read -- with a lot of mistakes -- he could lead a service even, but he made lot of mistakes, because he didn\u2019t have the intellectual stuff that goes with it. He had just learned it by rote and by heart and so on. But the climate was one of observance. Judaism was certainly central to our lives. There was not an intellectual climate.

            "answer": "Oh, at -- at home we spoke Alsatian, which 1s a dialect, based on German and my mother spoke French, obviously I spoke French and went to French school and in my teenage, rebellious years, I pretended I couldn\u2019t understand anything but French, which my father didn\u2019t speak. Don\u2019t forget, that Alsace moved back and forth between France and Germany, which meant that my grandmother, who lived with us, was born in the French period, to -- became German in 1871, when France lost the Prussian war. So both my parents were born under a German regime and went to German schools. Spoke German fluently. In 1918, France reverted to fran -- Al- Alsace reverted to France. Now, my mother came from a very Francophile, somewhat more educated family and all the daughters were sent to Paris, at least for some time, to be with an aunt, whom I know -- whom I knew too, and there they perfected their French. So my mother spoke and wrote perfect French. No spelling mistake, no nothing, she didn\u2019t -- but she also could do it in German. My father -- whose business was with the peasants, the farmers, the -- the rural community, never bothered to learn French. So he could understand somewhat. So as I said, in my rebellious teenage years, when he and I collided, I couldn\u2019t understand Alsatian. I should like to add something that -- very pa -- I don\u2019t know how interesting it is to this particular interview, but Alsatian Jews speak not -- sp-speak what is called in French, le Judeo Alsatian, or in their own parlance, they call it Yiddish dige. It\u2019s not Yiddish, because God forbid an Alsatian Jew should speak Yiddish. The Alsatian Jews look down on eastern European Jews, whom they all called Polacks, that\u2019s -- was the n-nomination, so just like the German Jews in this country look down on the immigrants that came after them from the eastern European countries. Exactly the same situation. My father is probably turning around 1n his grave, as I have discovered that this Judeo Alsatian, which they spoke, is really similar to Yiddish. It\u2019s not -- does not have -- it\u2019s -- doesn\u2019t have a written language, it doesn\u2019t have a literature. It was just a spoken language -- 1s dying out, but it\u2019s being retrieved and I happen -- I -- where as when I grew up, I thought of it as very crude and very common and I walked two miles behind my parents when they spoke it. Today, I\u2019m very interested in it and I have read a number of books. There -- I find out there 1s -- I have been communicating with people who are studying it and there is very few of us who still ha-have a feel for it. It\u2019s a very rich language, very different from Yiddish in it\u2019s pronunciation and it\u2019s formation of words, and is very much tied into Hebrew, which also intrigues me very much. So, this is how that beca --"

            "question": "Can -- can you give us a short example of how it sounds?",
            "answer": "Yes, I can give you one that I always use when people ask me. In Germany you say, \u201cEashe harbor gie gessen.\u201d I have eaten. In Yiddish, you say, \u201cAy chobe gessen.\u201d In Alsatian, you say, \u201cShop gessa.\u201d In Yiddish dige, le Judeo Alsatian, \u201cIshap ger archult.\u201d I don\u2019t if you know Hebrew, but ochell in Hebrew is to eat. So they -- they use the Hebrew word, they conjugate it in germaway and they say, Ishap. The big difference, eehope and ishap, that\u2019s the big different. Ishap ger archult and that\u2019s the way my father would speak, using Hebrew words, conjugating them and distorting them, so that in order to trace back what it really means, you really have to do a little research. And it\u2019s -- has intrigued enough people. There 1s a chair of Judeo Alsatian [indecipherable] at the university now. And it\u2019s a non-Jewish person who is studying it. So it\u2019s interesting [indecipherable]. But anyway, this is what we spoke at home. And coming back to this, the atmosphere, you know, my parents had no social life. They didn\u2019t go out, they didn\u2019t travel. My vacations were -- m-my grandparents house, maybe at an aunt, my -- once -- one aunt got married and lived in another village and she married a -- a cattle peddler. J-Jews were a lot of cattle peddlers or became merchants and grain merchants, cattle merchants and that kind of thing. So I went -- I went to spend some vacation with them. The only time my -- I remember taking a vacation was my mother and we went to Luxembourg in a Jewish hotel, was that -- there was an epidemic of polio and my mother took us there for several weeks. Is --"

            "num": 29,
            "question": "For what -- for what reason?",
            "answer": "Because there was an epidemic of polio -- to be away from Strasbourg and to go somewhere where it wouldn\u2019t affect us. Because in these days, you went into an iron lung and all this kind of thing. So twice I remember going there. But what really became my -- well, even before I go to that, let me say, my -- the focus of my life was school. For two reasons. One -- number one, I was interested. But number two, had a brother who\u2019s 13 months younger and my father made no bones about the fact he would have liked to have a boy first or maybe even two boys and no girl, because he needed one for the busine -- he needed two boys for the business. And I was an only -- only a girl. But I was very interested in school and did very well in school. So this mar -- the teachers and -- and I also went very unusually so for those days, I also went to what you\u2019d call here, Hebrew school and got a very solid Jewish education. An education which I continue throughout the years so that I\u2019m familiar and comfortable with the Hebrew -- of the service and I\u2019m comfortable with the Biblical text and I have continued studying. And so my goodies came not so much from my parents as it came from teachers and rabbis and educators. And also, when I was 12 years old, my parents permitted me to join the Jewish girl scout -- German -- and that really became the center of my life. Now, I\u2019m not unique in this. Of course, it took even more importance, because my parents, when -- couldn\u2019t give me the -- the cultural stuff that they didn\u2019t have. I mean, they -- they -- they -- they were not educated to -- to have this and so I got -- I got very involved and a total commitment to the Jewish girl scouts. Not the --when I -- when I say girl scout -- and the equivalent, I mean there is no comparison to the scouting movement today in the United Sta -- don\u2019t know what it was like 50 years ago, but that was a -- a total commitment to service, to -- to -- I\u2019m -- I -- to Jewish learning. There was a boy\u2019s movement and a girl\u2019s movement. I -- now, in back -- in looking back on it, I must have been an organizers from very early on, because by the time I was 13, I was already one of the leaders. You know, the movement at that time, unlike in the United State, no parent involvement. It was -- we called it leading through youth. We didn\u2019t have any parent involvement. So we got leadership training and we got all kinds of stuff. I took these kids hiking in the mountains every Sunday, or practically every Sunday and we roughed it up, we went camping, we dig out trenches. We kept kosher at camp and we -- we cooked on -- we didn\u2019t have any of the equipments that you have today, we really roughed it out. But it was and it 1s an indi -- 1t -- we have a- still today, we -- we have a bound, a -- a tie between us that 1s the s-something that is difficult to describe. And the Jewish youth movement became a very active movement in the resistance in France during the war and then eventually after the war, some of them found a kibbutzim in Israel. And I am still not in correspondence, because [indecipherable] because our -- our what we call the commissaire, the -- the big leader over the whole region there, there\u2019s a man who is now in his 90\u2019s, he is deaf, he is blind, and -- but I\u2019m -- I still get news from him or about him.

And, although I have really no answer to it and I have read books and I\u2019ve tried -- people have been pondering, why did some people become rescuers and why did some stand by? And actually participated here, at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in a workshop led by somebody from Germany and -- on rescue and resistance. And I also have connected in the last few years, with some of my co-workers in the camps and in the underground and we pondered this, too, because we [indecipherable] ask, why did you did what you do -- did? And the only answer that everybody [indecipherable], we ha -- there was a job to be done and we did it. Now, why did we do it and not somebody el -- the -- I have been pondering and I really don\u2019t know, except that maybe in this deep involvement in this youth movement, I took on a sense of responsibility and caring and duty, sort of. And more recently I have been thinking about it and my mother, who was not an educated woman, but sh -- and she was a very gentle and rather passive woman, yet, she was a caretaker. She took care of all her siblings. Or -- and of not only siblings, of -- of relatives in need and that kind of thing. And of her mother-in-law, who didn\u2019t give her an easy time either, but she was there and I\u2019m wondering whether I unconsciously, you know, had some -- some model there. Be -- and my father, who was really a -- a very -- man with a very high temper and really a tyrant, but nevertheless, he let my mother do all this helping. In other words, he opened his pocketbook and there was never any problem. So I wasn\u2019t a deprived child in a sense of physical [indecipherable] thing. We lived simply, not luxuriously, but I didn\u2019t have this -- I -- I really got my goodies from the scouting movement."

And I\u2019ve stayed with her and I\u2019ve talked with her for a long time, but that\u2019s something else [Il talk to you about you later. I -- I really have had ver -- little relationship with my family in France and it\u2019s only in recent years that I have -- well, recent -- not quite -- not -- maybe the last 20 years or so that I have really intensively reconnected and with a great deal of pleasure. But so, when you say, did they lose their belief in God? I don\u2019t know what belief they lost, bu -- la- they certainly lost their -- any belief in -- in things Jewish. Her sister married a Jewish man eventually. Somebody much older than herself and sh -- he died of Parkinson\u2019s disease very young, and she -- and she also last -- lost all contact -- she ha -- c-continued the contact with the family, but Judaism she completely put aside. And her son married a non-Jewish person and her ch -- grandchildren are not Jewish. Interesting enough, now that she\u2019s retired -- and she became a social worker -- now that she\u2019s retired, she has, in a very -- how shall I say? Intellectual, secular way, reconnected to -- to things Jewish. She studies and she\u2019s interest in groups. Not for observers -- observance as much as for unders -- of -- of thinking, you know, [indecipherable]. My other two -- I mean and I -- air -- I can go down the line, I have six cousins like that and their ties to Judaism have loosened a great deal. And if they haven\u2019t, I have two male cousins and they have married Jewish girls, but their own children, except for one, are -- no longer have any tie with -- but you know, I don\u2019t know whether the effect of the war, or whatever it 1s, but whatever I have read about statistics 1s that they -- this is very typical of the Jewish population in France. So, whether the war had -- o-of the old Jewish population, now there is an influx of observance brought in by the Sephardic Jews from North Africa."

But I was searching and of course, when I came here as a student, I had discovered Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism, all kinds of formulas which - which I was not familiar. And don\u2019t forget, I had had five years of war -- of really living as a Catholic as well and cut off -- although I do remember even living as a Catholic, we had a very clandestine seder and -- and a -- and all kinds of -- I have never really been away from Judaism, even when I was living as a Catholic. And as soon as the war was over, I was back into a | -- being the head of a Jewish children\u2019s home and instilling a love of Judaism and teaching and training the kids and so forth and so on. When I came to this country, I discovered this other formulas and I just observed, I wasn\u2019t really becoming a part of any of this. And I got married in a traditional Jewish ceremony in Strasbourg. My parents -- I -- small apartment, because after the war they had lost everything and they were sharing apartment with somebody else, as a matter of fact. But we got married in a synagogue and came back here and we joined a Conservative synagogue. Our home -- I did not keep a kosher home, but kept a -- oh, a very traditional oriented ka -- ya -- obs -- nee -- at least observing Friday night and attending services on and off. It was not a same commitment that I had before, until about almost 50 years ago. Well, I'll be married 50 years next year, so it\u2019s about 48 or 49 years ago. I heard a lecture by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionism and he really expressed for me a direction for me to go into. It was a very revealing kind of lecture. I still have the notes that I took. He defined -- as you know, Reconstruction, it defines Judaism as a dynamic, religious civilization. God as the power that makes for salvation. And I began to read Rabbi Kaplan. I began to subscribe to Reconstructionist magazine. And it opened to me a whole m -- way of living my Judaism in a more creative and in a more -- in a happier way. My childhood was full of don\u2019t, and it\u2019s a sin and all the forbidding kinds of thing. One of the strongest phrases that remains in my memory, is in Kaplan\u2019s writing, he talks about reading into the Torah, or reading out of it. And I grew up where everybody read into the Torah because -- this is repeated three times and this is -- were -- this is -- has a meaning and usually the meaning ended up in some forbidden to do this and forbidden to do that, etcetera. [indecipherable] Rabbi Kaplan talks about reading into the Torah, reading into the teaching of the Torah itself, the text itself. And doing things in a more creative ways. And so after that, this is -- this has been my -- my direction. And especially with our children. We -- we -- they all -- they all attended Conservative synagogues. They all went to Jewish camps. They went to Camp Ramah, they went to --"

I don\u2019t know how to say it, but I\u2019m always looking for ways of making my Judaism more meaningful and more joyous, happy with -- with creative things. So we were very fortunate because -- well, in c -- we first lived in Cleveland, my husband and I. I -- I graduated from Western Reserve and my husband was still attending school at Case. We settled in Cleveland after we got married, which 1s 1949 and I\u2019m -- my first job was as a director of a Jewish day nursery, which was Jewish day care center, affiliated with the Jewish [indecipherable] in Cleveland, which was a top notch agency. And this is where, eventually, I got my training, also in child therapy. M-My degree is in social work. I had gotten my degree at Western Reserve. But I specialized in early childhood, because in France I already had a degree in early childhood, so I combined the two and I specialized in that. And little by little, I developed my skills in -- in working for, or in behalf, or with young children. And we joined a synagogue, a Conservative synagogue and I think I have taken -- so have -- adult -- my husband, too, we have taken adult education classes all our lives, in -- in the various synagogues and I learned more about Reconstructionism. I\u2019ve -- I have -- I have read a great deal about this. In Cleveland, we belonged to such a huge congregation, like 2,000 families, that 1t was very difficult to form any meaningful relationships. And although -- I was working, raising kids and we had a real struggle when we first started here. I didn\u2019t have a penny to my name, my husband had not a penny to his name. We lived in two rooms- not two room apartment, a -- a -- not two bedroom apartment, two room apartment, upstairs, raising a kid. We eventually got a house. It -- the financial struggle was -- was rough and after I had my first child, I stayed home for four years, although I worked part time on the side. But what I did was, I worked as a Sunday school teacher on Sundays, just to get away from the house and leave a child to daddy. And I taught second grade Sunday school, which I\u2019d never done before, but it provided me also with a tie to the Temple and that kind of thing. We left Cleveland at the time our oldest son was ready to be Bar Mitzvah and my husband was transferred to Syracuse. And had to join the existing Conservative synagogue there, because he had to be Bar Mitzvah -- I mean, that was his [indecipherable] and -- but we were very unhappy with the establishment synagogue, with -- with -- we -- 1t was so rote -- it was so uncreative, but we went, you see? I -- we schlepped our kids there and we went and we made no exception to this kind of thing, until we discovered that in the suburb of Syracuse called Dewitt, they were creating a new Conservative synagogue. We were younger in those days, although we were much older than the general age of the congregation, we just -- I -- I have to tell you that story. I read about this congregation, then I found out what time their Friday night service are and we went with our kids on Friday night. And the rabbi, though very rigidly observant, nevertheless, he had a -- a way of teaching, a way of making the service interesting. But he had passed mimeographed sheets with some special readings or discussion point or whatever it was that Friday night and I was ecstatic about something."

But, from the people who remained committed to their Judaism in some way -- I remember holiday celebrations in the camp, or Shabbat celebration, that I remember having a very positive kind of affect on me, that these people, under the circumstance on which they live, they remained Jewish.

They lived -- they had very little to eat, because the guards took the food and people died of dysentery, died of -- I mean, there are 3000 people died just of malnutrition. Was a study of malnutrition in the camps. And the original intent was to improve the conditions in the camps. ORT, if you know it, is a Jewish organization, brought sewing machines for the women, organized workshops. I have pictures of, and my -- my sister-in-law\u2019s younger brother worked in one -- in the kitchen. I mean, they did all -- they did some -- her father, who was a shoemaker, organized a shoe repair shop, and -- and with the -- je - with the organization, there were non-Jewish organization as well of Jewish ones. There were very few Jewish ones, allowed us to -- to live in the camp. And I was in a farm with my parents and one of my scouting leaders got a hold of me -- and I don\u2019t know how she got my address."

Can you imagine today 18 year old girls, girl scouts, you know? But this was the commitment we had and she was -- she was one of our leaders. And I knew her and she got ahold of me and so I went to live in the camp. I was 21 years old when I first started and we- we tr -- I was in charge originally, to do something on behalf of the kids. So the first Shabbat I was there, I had, in this big empty barrack, I -- we announced that all - there would be a program for the kids, a program with nothing. I mean, nothing -- I mean, nothing. Singing, what we could do and maybe something like -- and I had 280 kids in that barrack, all ages. But here again, I had the support of that internee population. There were teachers, there were rabbi\u2019s, there were professionals of all kinds, doctors. And they helped. And they were internee themselves and they had been already in this camp, we -- and this was a tremendous lesson in human values and in -- in -- in human strengths, internal strengths. I mean, it was incredible for me to see people had lived in these conditions all the -- for all this length and time. The dignity with which they continue to live, under the very c-condition in which they lived. They\u2019d had no water to wash, they had no -- I mean, it was awful. And this is - this is originally what I did, and I was part of a team that delivered extra rations. We got, through all the agency, we delivered rations into the ca -- into the barracks and then eventually in as -- paralleled another -- another part of the team of Ose worked on the liberation of the kids from camp. And then I participated in taking kids out and- and helped in that process as well. They overlapped, kind of thing. But a book has recently been published by one -- the -- the -- the worker with whom I worked in that camp, and -- but she left before the deportations started, but she set that whole liberation process into movement. And is very interesting as she -- she wrote the book, she quotes me in the book. It\u2019s in French, I don\u2019t know how your French 1s, and she quotes me. There\u2019s a picture of me in the book and it\u2019s a pre -- the book got a- an award in France. And it\u2019s very interesting, she recalls things that I did and said and I have no recollection of them at all. We all have very selective memories, so I -- I was interesting to read.

And this reconnecting with the past has been a tremendous thing for me in the last 20 years. When I first came here -- well, I came as a student, I went back and then I came, because I\u2019d met my husband, and I really wanted to put everything -- everything behind me. I didn\u2019t even speak French to my kids. Today I think it was stupid. They could be bilingual so easily, but my husband doesn\u2019t speak French and I certainly didn\u2019t want to speak German and my husband doesn\u2019t -- has even forgotten his German. He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with anything German. So I had worked for the Joint Distribution Committee in Paris for a year, in between my -- getting my degree here and then coming back eventually, because I had to work for my scholarship for -- to repay my scholarship. So, I n- never wrote back to anybody, in any of the agencies, not -- I -- I mean, with very few exceptions. There are a few people I may have sent a Rosh Hashanah card or something like that. And I did go back when -- the first time I went back is in 1952, because my parents made it possible for us to bring their first grandchild -- not their first grandchild, they had already a whole bunch of grandchildren. My brother married much younger than I did. But bring the American grandchild over. And we went over. And yes, I saw maybe one or two friends. One, I worked with during the - in -- after the war and she was from my hometown and maybe we met in Paris, and another one, but it was a very social kind of thing. I didn\u2019t see any -- or didn\u2019t make a point of seeing any of my worker from the Joint Distribution Committee. I always went to see -- no, I didn -- I must correct that. All went -- went to see that one person who was the director of a children\u2019s home, with whom I worked during the war and who after the war became the director of Ose. And I continue, even today. He\u2019s dead, but his wife is in a nursing home and I still write to her a card on the holiday."

We had children the same age and she was a concert scholarship student too, from Italy, who came after me, to Cleveland. And I barely knew what she did during the war, or -- I - I sort of know.

            "answer": "I know exactly when it happened. It was in the late -- in the mid 70\u2019s or early seven -- mid 70\u2019s, I cannot quite peg it. The council of Jewish women in clee -- in Syracuse, where we lived -- well, people knew that I was from France, that I had done some underground work, or had worked in camp and -- I mean, th-there was some general knowledge, but I had never, sort of really going a -- I think that once sisterhood asked me to participate in a program -- they will have other people who had lived in Europe and I -- I must have sa-said a few word. But then, the Council of Jewish women was working with the educators in Syracuse to introduce the Holocaust in their curriculum. And now we\u2019re going to a very touchy subject. And I was asked to participate. This is the first time where I really did something officially, as a witness of the Holocaust, if you wish. That\u2019s the best definition I can come, because I don\u2019t view myself as a survivor, I don\u2019t view myself as -- I -- I was a rescuer, but at the same time was also a victim. So I always say I\u2019m a witness of the Holocaust. And so I participated in that. And then something fantastic happened. We separated in two groups. One group was younger women, was -- they were mostly women, who wanted to create a group of children of survivors. And the other group wanted to meet with teachers and talk about curriculum. And I went with the children of survivors. And all of a sudden, I find myself much older than these people. They were actually mostly professional women, whom I had known in the professional -- Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection my professional li -- had no idea they were Jewish and certainly no idea they were children of survivors. And they -- each one of them were talking about their experience -- I\u2019m sure you know the syndrome of children of survivors and how the books have been written about them and I had read the book -- Epstein\u2019s book, \u201cThe Children of the Holocaust.\u201d And, as I listened to them and they asked me where I fit in out of it, I began to tell them of my experience. And I cried and I cried. I\u2019m still crying today. And all of a sudden, the floodgates opened. I had never done that before. It was like yay, you have a lot of grieving to do. You have a lot of unfinished business. And they created -- there\u2019s a group, I helped them create it and -- but I didn\u2019t become a part of it, because I was too close to them. Although I\u2019m a therapist and I\u2019m a psychiatric social worker. And I -- they wanted somebody -- a professional, to lead their group. I -- I was -- I was -- I couldn\u2019t. I was too close to that kind of thing. But it told me that I had a lot of work to do. Now, I didn\u2019t start the next day with task one, two and three, but I allowed myself to -- to let the -- all these memories get into me. And I was aware of having been affected by -- by -- by all of these experiences, in very strange ways. I would see a program of refugees on the road in Bangladesh or wherever and I\u2019d burst in tears. So I know that -- I mean, we were expelled, we fled, we were on the road for -- for days and nights and all of this - so I knew I had that in me, unresolved. And so -- and little by little, I began to talk more about this. I accepted. I didn\u2019t really do much in Syracuse. This was more in the 70\u2019s. Maybe I gave a talk or two, maybe at the synago -- I don\u2019t know pr-precisely, but I was able to talk about it. And then -- oh, there\u2019s something else happened. Since my husband traveled, as he told you, a great deal, internationally, I had the opportunity at one point -- he was working for two weeks in Paris and I must have been able to take two weeks off.

And it felt wonderful, because there I didn\u2019t have the lack of understanding. I had instant comprehension, you know, it was -- we were on the same wavelength. And we talked and -- now I cannot say that we stayed in touch, because none of us are really corresponding. But I fairly frequently went to France, but mostly what happened was that I was able to talk about my experiences here. Now, it\u2019s a universal phenomenon for survival, is to not have talked about their experiences for 30 years and it is shared by the people in France and it\u2019s shared by people here. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a universal thing. And I had read about the Holocaust, I had read Elie Wiesel\u2019s book. Elie Wiesel, by the way, was a kid of Ose, who had been coming to France to -- to -- in 19- ever -- I\u2019d -- and I\u2019d -- the end of the war, and he was rescued by Ose, whe -- in one of the children\u2019s homes. And the director of that children\u2019s home 1s one of my very good friends, and so we\u2019ve talked about him. And every time I go to Paris I see her and we talk about these kids, we talk about -- we talk about all these things of the past. And I think that enabled me to begin to talk about my experiences. I\u2019m not sure exactly when, exactly, and with what group, but I had to go through that journey of reconnecting and it really d -- the -- the -- the cath -- the cathartic point was when I had that meeting with this -- this [indecipherable] of survival, when I became aware that -- that all that grieving that I hadn\u2019t done -- nobody had time to grieve, you had to -- you had to go on and that I -- I had to -- to go back 1n all this experience and talk about them. And then, in 1982, we moved to France -- 1983, we moved to France. I retired from -- [ -- at that time I was on the faculty of the Upstate Medical Center in the Department of Pediatrics and Child Psychiatry.

But for me, it\u2019s also much more being -- since I view Judaism as having evolved over the centuries, I do not view it as fixed, I view it as a historical Judaism, Conservative Judaism 1s historical Judaism. It views that Judaism has changed over -- over the centuries, according to the ages in which it lived.

It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s evolves constantly and to me that is the important. It has to be dynamic, it has to change with the days.

And the women downs -- the men downstairs and I upstairs and they didn\u2019t even have -- when the Torah reading came, they didn\u2019t have a hamas -- a -- a book to read the Torah reading.

So, you know, it\u2019s this kind of attitude that say I can\u2019t worship here. So, you know, we tried the -- the -- North African community in which we lived, I mean they were even more rigid. And then they -- Judaism in France, traditional Judaism does not accept conversions that are not made by Orthodox rabbi- it\u2019s a little bit like in Israel. So there were many converts in -- who had no place to 5 go, so they formed their own liberal mo -- le mouvement liberale juivre de France. And -- but they had nobody to lead it. So some -- they wanted us to help them and we met at people\u2019s houses. And who carried the burden [indecipherable]. So they asked me to become the president. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not a citizen. I\u2019m an American citizen. You can\u2019t have a president who is not a citizen and incorporate this group. I don\u2019t -- and I don\u2019t want to be and I\u2019m leaving again. I\u2019m not staying here.\u201d And they were totally on the wrong tracks. But we -- we participated and whatever."

To me, the core of -- of thing like -- we have traveled a great deal. I have attended service in Istanbul and I\u2019ve attended service in Stockholm and I have attended services all over. And to me, this is fantastic, that I can walk in there and I know enough of the service that I can open whatever prayer book they give me. It\u2019s always Hebrew. The Hebrew is the Hebrew. The service is the same, bu -- it\u2019s a -- this -- this -- this fantastic thing that binds Jews from all over the world. T-To me this 1s -- and I -- and I\u2019m very grateful that I have the Jewish knowledge to be able to enjoy this. To -- you know, I -- we went with a group of people to istan -- service at Istanbul and of course the women were upstairs. What else is new? And so I -- I listen, I listen and it\u2019s a different pronunciation and all that, but I know where I am. There was a -- one other woman, she was a rabbi\u2019s wife and she found her place too. And they all said, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d But you know, for a lifelong attendance at service and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- so, what a -- I don\u2019t want this to be destroyed by rigidity. I want it to be alive with variety. I don\u2019t know what else to say. [ -- | haven\u2019t put it in words. And that\u2019s to me 1s exciting. So, getting into a new group, that\u2019s -- wants to be inclusive and yet at the same time maintain some 1 tradition, that\u2019s what\u2019s important to me, so we tried that, we were not very successful in France, because we were the only ones who really were with any contin -- no, people were floating in and out. Eventually, for the high holidays, we went to Geneva, Switzerland, which was an hour and a half away and spent the high holidays there. Ah, because they had a very interesting international community there, with a rabbi who was trained in Cincinnati and so we had a very interesting service there and we felt very welcome and they included a lot of English -- English and French in the service. And they -- and it was okay. See, even though I do understand the -- the - the Hebrew, I want the -- the secular language to be included. To -- to include more people. This is too important to me, is to include people. So, anyway, so we lived in France and there I all -- there I really connected. First of all, Ose, the agency for which I worked, was doing their archives and they send a interviewer to Lyon and I did an oral tape for them, of course in French. And the woman with whom I worked in Rivesaltes, who was already at Rivesaltes when I got there -- she was a philosophy student from a completely assimilated family who didn\u2019t even know what Hanukkah was --and, so I don\u2019t know what brought her to the camp, but that\u2019s her problem, not mine. And she became the director of Ose. And so we got in touch with her, because she read my report and she related to it. And that --"

Yo -- we met here and you slept in my room there and --\u201d I don\u2019t remember these things. But 1t was wonderful, because all these people were part of my past. I -- it was almost like reclaiming a piece of myself. And so allowed myself to open up and to -- to hear all these things, to talk about all these things, to cry about these thing. So these three years in France, I -- I did that oral history and I -- and I -- I really was able to -- to share a great deal. And at the same time, I really reconnected with my cousins. And Jew -- they were not -- they -- they be not -- that doesn\u2019t -- I ma -- I -- it was family and we talked about our -- we -- we filled all our holes in our memories about our parents and grandparents and that. In the meanwhile, th -- since then, I\u2019ve done a lot of genealogical work out -- one of our sons is very interested in that and he is on the computer and doing all kinds of stuff. And so, I have send them all this stuff too and I found a cousin on my father\u2019s side and all this kind of thing has hap -- I mean, he found me, I didn\u2019t find him, he found me. And so, all of this has been very, very beneficial to -- to me. And so when I came back from France and we settled down here and we joined a congregation, a Conservative one. And I joined the educa -- adult education committee, what else? And the [indecipherable] committee. It was not as satisfactory, because the memories of our congregation in Syracuse are such that we can never duplicate that. It was -- you cannot recreate an extended family like that when you\u2019re older than the rest of the peop -- you can no longer move in the same -- in the same way. So we, sadly we - we have not connected in our congregation. But, coming back to my work there, I gave several talks. I offered to -- because I was part of adult education, I gave a talk about my experiences. And this led to my being the Holocaust speaker, maybe about SIX years ago, seven years ago, I was -- on Yom HaShoah, there 1s Holocaust day, I was the speaker for this -- the whole Chapel Hill community. It was extremely well attended and I was able to di -- I -- I wrote a paper, a -- you know, based on my experience and I mostly talked about what we alluding to before, how do you talk about the Holocaust. And I had read an article by Rabbi Shulweiss. He\u2019s a rabbi in Encino Valley in -- in -- in California. And he\u2019s always been one of my gurus, one of the people I like to read. He\u2019s very liberal minded and he is -- we actually -- when we were in California -- we took a trip to California about 11 years ago and we made it a point to be, on Saturday, in -- in that area, so we could attend services. Well, he -- he is such a personal person. I mean, he comes and shakes your hand and where are you from? And I know somebody in Chapel Hill and this -- this kind of thing. But he 1s liberal, he is -- he writes beautifully, he is -- he is my kind of rabbi. I\u2019ve never had one like that. And he had written about telling his children about the Holocaust and how do you tell them about it and how he had great deal of difficulties dealing with this and telling his children about the Holocaust, until he found about -- found out about the Righteous Gentiles and about the people who have helped, during the -- during the war in -- in all countries. And that not, quote, everybody was against the Jews, unquote. There were people helping. And by looking at that aspect of the -- what happened during the war, he was able to then talk to his children about the other things that happened."

But there was a humane aspect, at least in some of the people. And the second thing is, in talking to the children about these horrible things that happened, from time immorial whether it\u2019s from Haman down to all the generations of the Crusades and what have you, all our kids hear is about the persecution. But when you can tell them about people who\u2019ve helped the Jews and are still helping the Jews, you can m- modify that message. And when you -- and to me there is one more point, if you can talk about things that Jews have achieved, they\u2019re -- next to the Holocaust Museum, there should be a museum of the -- learning through the ages, the -- I\u2019m not talking about the Nobel Prizes, the Jewish Nobel Prizes or the Jewish basketball players. I\u2019m talking about the wisdom of -- of the ages, of the si -- of the -- the learning that took place, the contributions to -- to everything. And you have to balance it all. And so, this was the gist of my talk. I talked about -- I didn\u2019t talk about what I did -- I can never talk about what I did during the war. This, to me, is -- number one it\u2019s too personal and number two, it\u2019s I focus -- I want to focus on the children and -- and what happened to them. But I also wanted to -- with this -- this reading of -- this thing about -- that Rabbi Shulweiss wrote, I was able to focus also on the rescue aspect. And then I can wean myself into that whole rescuing effort. But I\u2019m a Jew, rescuing my own. You know, it\u2019s not quite the same as non-Jew rescuing."

And at first I was not very selective and I accepted all the offers, feeling that I had a duty, a responsibility, and -- and becoming aware that indeed, you have to talk in the first person. You -- this is the real stuff, that can touch you. And this summer, I feel very virtuous, I cleaned out my files, because I was home so much. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection And I have stacks and stacks of letters from kids in schools where I talked about. And I keep those. I have thrown out a lot of stuff in my life, but I\u2019m keeping these. I hope my children and grandchildren would see them, because they\u2019ve been touched by -- by the real thing and so, although I usually tell them I don\u2019t -- that -- that other people have known what I have done and that kind of thing. I said, I have to tell them specifically what I did, otherwise not real to them. So I have learned to do that in various, different ways. And of course I have -- I\u2019ve talked. I give a li -- different emphasis whether I talk at the university or whether I talk at the church youth group and you know, it\u2019s different, focus is different, [indecipherable] is different, pattern. But I\u2019ve been able to do it as a berd -- on -- as I told you earlier. And just last year, I did so many that it was really exhausting and then I -- I\u2019m doing -- handling it very well, while I\u2019m -- my audience -- and I don\u2019t need any notes, I don\u2019t need any papers and I just talk and I -- I love to talk in public. This is -- by the way, is -- I don\u2019t write. I have never been able to write and even in my very successful schooling, writing was always a problem. And my teachers tore out their hair and they didn\u2019t know why I was so good in everything else, and not in writing. So writing is something I don\u2019t do. But I make an outline -- I make myself an outline, once I know I have to have a beginning and a middle and an end and I have to clearly define in my introduction what I\u2019m going to cover and then I zoom and I talk. And that\u2019s how -- like I said, I don\u2019t have my written talks, except for the one that I gave at this conference at UNC, where they were supposed to be published in a book. They never were, but I really wrote out something on rescue and resistance. And so until last year, I found out that I had this after reaction of arrhythmia -- of irregular heartbeat. When it happened the first time, I didn\u2019t quite relate, but it happened the second time, after I gave a talk, and then I went to see a doctor and I\u2019m on medication. So I have been slowing down on this a little bit. And I heard a speaker from England, a wonderful person, a non- Jew, who has devoted his life to teaching the Holocaust -- in -- in England, Steven Smith, who created the one and only teaching Holocaust museum in England and he- after hi -- an experience in Israel, when he went to Yad Vashem and came back to devote his life to this and I heard him talk here, in a small group. Somebody brought him over and then I told him about, you know, my difficulty to continue talking. He says, \u201cBut then, don\u2019t do it. Let somebody else do it.\u201d And I have to accept the fact that I\u2019m not going to do as much of that any more. But I must go and tell you about something else that has given me back so much in the last few years. About five -- it'll be five years this December, Ose had, in celebration, I believe of the 80th anniversary of the creation of Ose in -- in Russia, a reunion in Paris of the hidden children. The children they had hidden during the war. And of course I went. And to me, this has been the highlight of my last few years here and a tremendously important experience. Because, when I -- as I have given these interviews, as I\u2019m doing with you today. Or as I\u2019m being -- talk and s -- people ask me for specifics, I don\u2019t remember specifics. I don\u2019t remember names of kids, I don\u2019t remember specific facts. Is it because in the early years here, I really so blocked out everything that it\u2019s blocked away totally?

And when the war was over and I reopened the first children\u2019s home, I took her into that children\u2019s home and she was in the sewing room and she showed me pictures of her with me and all that. I don\u2019t remember. And she found me where we were living in France. She happened to be on sabbatical with her husband, who is at the university in Richmond and she\u2019s an artist. She had come to this country to unite with family and it didn\u2019t work out, as so often it didn\u2019t, but she made a life for herself. Had no children. And so she told me all that story and then we have -- now, whenever we go through Richmond, I see her. Whenever she comes down here -- she was here recently and she did a lot of beautiful artwork and have it in -- and she gave me a lot of her work. And she has such a positive memory of the things I did on behalf of her family and herself, that I was astounded. I was -- I mean, anybody thinks that much. You know, I had just sort of -- because I -- I couldn\u2019t remember these things, I thought maybe I hadn\u2019t put anything into it. And then there was this reunion in France. And here I was with my husband and there were 500 children between the ages of 55 and 70, I would say, coming from all over the world. Of course, the majority from France, but they were from Israel, they were from Argentina, they were from the United States, from England, from all over. And they were looking for pieces of themselves in -- in other\u2019s memories. And pictures were plastered all over, for people looking each other. Be -- I stayed with my cousin, so I didn\u2019t stay there the whole time, but I attended all the meeting. And some people were looking for me. Some kids were looking for me. There was particularly one woman, I mean th-this one had phoned me already. She had gone to Paris seeking -- looking for anybody she had been connected with during the war, because she had lost all her family. And she lived in Toronto and she had, through somebody at the information center on the Holocaust, she had ga -- f -- happened to meet somebody whom I worked with during the war, and gave her my addre -- and she wrote to me and I found out that I was the director of the children\u2019s home, after the war, where she was. And she told me any number of stories about me and the things I did. Including serving these kids breakfast in bed on Shabbat morning, because I don\u2019t remember it. She told me ab -- that -- the stories I told on Friday night, that she had kept with her all her life. I don\u2019t remember. But it must have been me and then it must have have happened. And then in Paris, the most fantastic thing that happened wa -- there was Friday evening service -- there were Friday evening of wet -- at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, because sundown is at four o\u2019clock and it\u2019s winter and this December.

But nothing distinguished the social workers from -- the workers from the -- the children, the counselor, and we all had the same nametag.

First Rivesaltes and then I worked in a children\u2019s home called Polousa and then I worked in the underground and then I worked -- I opened a children\u2019s home in Moultanta and then one outside of Paris. So, for this agency, I worked in four different places. And so -- and of course there were workers there and I knew many of the workers and it was wonderful to talk with the workers. Some came from Israel, some came from elsewhere and, \u201cDo you remember, you slept in my room that night when you were arrested?\u201d \u201cI did? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d And that kind of thing. But up -- up in that service on Friday afternoon, next to me sits a very elegant woman in her fur coat and she jerks around and says in French to me, \u201cWhere you from?\u201d And I said, \u201cFrom America.\u201d And she says, \u201cOh, you look so French. I thought you were from France.\u201d So I says, \u201cI\u2019m a little bit from both.\u201d And then she looks at my tags. \u201cOh, you were in Rivesaltes?\u201d All the way -- all the time thinking that I\u2019m one of the kids, too, you know, because it doesn\u2019t say social worker or worker or any -- or counselor or anything like that. And she said, \u201cWhen were you there?\u201d And I s -- told her. And then she says, \u201cI was in Rivesaltes. My parents were in Rivesaltes, they were deported. My brother was in Rivesaltes. And a social worker took me out of the camp, although I was over 16, she faked my papers. And I shall all remember her, she took me out and took me to such and such a pla --.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat was -- what was the name of the social worker?\u201d And she said, \u201cSimone Weil.\u201d And it was just absolutely incredible. We just fell into each other\u2019s arms and -- and then she happens to know my sister-in-law and all the store -- that -- she survived, obviously, in hiding. And she married a Jewish -- French Jewish man who knew my family and so that\u2019s why she knew about my family, about my brother. And we talked and when the service was over, we went downstairs, we met the men and we\u2019ve -- and then she\u2019s been writing to me -- you know, not much, but - but through her, somebody else got in touch with me and then there was the woman in -- in Toronto who got somebody else in touch with me. And these kids, in quotation mark, have given me back so much in -- of my own memories. And validating someone, myself or my work, which I had completely devaluated, because of my lack of memory, that maybe that\u2019s what has enabled me to give all these talks. And to -- to really talk about the children, because they have enriched my memories tremenda -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s ust been incredible. And then books have been written, books that describe experiences that have been mine and I have read them and so this has been my latest journey, as of the last five years. And we\u2019ve gone back to France. In fact, next year would be our 50th wedding anniversary and we plan to go back to Strasbourg, where I still have a cousin. And so we -- each time I go now, we reconnect and so, at that conference, I had another fantastic experience. We met -- wh-when I say we, I mean we, all retired social workers -- not social worker -- all professional workers of the same vintage, within a year or two, who had all worked for Ose during the war, either in the camp -- three of us -- four of us were from the camp and had worked in Rivesaltes. One was the wife of the -- the widow of the -- the head of our underground team and another one w-was the worker who was in the children\u2019s home, but we all, in one capacity or another had been connected to this work. We met together after the conference. And it was the most wonderful thing that happened to me. Something that doesn\u2019t exist for me in this country. There\u2019s no one I can talk like that. And my husband wasn\u2019t part of that. He -- he -- he -- he [indecipherable] went up the Eiffel Tower or something, but anyway, we had this wonderful sharing and I needed it.

I went, eventually, when we left Cleveland and my husband was transferred to Syracuse, I interrupted for awhile, because we had just made an -- hit a new city and Robby was just entering school and I floundered around for awhile, not knowing what I wanted to do and Syracuse was -- looked to me like to be in the dark ages as compared to Cleveland. Eventually it turned out to be really our highlight in our life. And eventually I went to work for child guidance clinic.

And that\u2019s very different from having [indecipherable] so we are quite a large step removed from that. And particularly my husband who was not -- I mean he left Germany at -- when he was 17 and was in England. So, he was interned in England, you know, J-Jews were interned -- I mean, Germans were interned in Eng-England, so he was in the [indecipherable] he was in a camp, but that camp was a country club compared to what people in France had to go through. So I don\u2019t think my children considered themselves as children of survivors. They consider -- th-they know their parents have a history and they have shown some interest in it. I can only compare my family, for instance, to this other woman who w-was a witness 1n Italy and -- and went through that -- who came, also as a counseled student. And she has the same relationship that we have with their three children, we -- we have same age children, with one in between. And I don\u2019t see any difficulties in these relationships. And interesting enough, my husband has a sister in New York, there\u2019s a big age gap and she got married youn -- married very young and s -- and he got married very late, so the -- the generations are very skewed, you know, so she\u2019s already a great grandmother, you know, and we, our grandch-children are not even Bar Mitzvah, you know, so it\u2019s a big, big gap there. And they have two daughters -- my sister-in-law, they have two daughters and one is in her 60\u2019s already, my niece and her sister. And her sister is a few years younger and her sister considers herself as a chil -- a child of survivors and attended all these meetings of a group as child of survivors. And the older sister doesn\u2019t understand it, why does she have that need? So it 1s something entirely perceived by the child, for God knows -- a variety of individual reasons, a pass -- this- place in the family, self perception, I don\u2019t know what. But I don\u2019t feel -- the only thing that -- both boys married, of course, women born in this country. Have no connection -- I mean, they\u2019re American born women and -- so sometimes I feel there is a -- there is a -- a little gap there. Just a little gap there, just like this -- we are -- we are not the old generation from the old countries, but we are different. But I cannot quantify it or qua -- even qualify it. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that I perceive, but I don\u2019t think our children ever felt themself to be any different for having parents who were survi --except from having parents who mispronounce names [indecipherable] my sons made any numbers of -- of jokes about their mother putting the accent on -- on syllable -- on being more strict than most parent.

I would like to 6 duplicate it with the kids, but it\u2019s getting too big and I\u2019m getting too -- I can\u2019t handle that many people at a time. But anyway, we went into Germany -- I mean first we went Alsace, I showed them where my parents lived, where I went when I went to school, where my grandparents lived. We showed them all of that. Also went to the cemetery and saw the monument to the Holocaust, all that kind of thing. And went into Germany and Mart-Martin was very determined, we\u2019re just going to go. I don\u2019t want to talk to anybody and we\u2019re going to go just to see the place and show the children where my house was, the cemetery, the school and synagogue and so on -- which doesn\u2019t exist any more. And then we\u2019re going -- we\u2019re driving back, I had [indecipherable] the whole itinerary, I had all the reservations. We were going to just breathe as little of the air as we could and speak a little German as we could and just do it, because it -- 1t was an ex -- valid -- valid experience for our children, to see where their father grew up. And then -- w-we went two cars and our son flagged us down and said, \u201cYou know, this has been a long drive, we -- I don\u2019t think we can make it back to France today. We are very tired.\u201d And then he asked, \u201cDo you think Dad would mind if we spend another night in Germany?\u201d They were so aware of that. And we said, \u201cNo, what\u2019s -- that\u2019s okay, if we can get a room,\u201d -- we were in Heidelberg. And we got a hotel, we needed three rooms and we got three rooms and we went there and the kids went of their own way. We just wanted each our own space a little bit and they wanted to do their thing. And Martin and I walked around 7 in Heidelberg. But the kids were conscious of the fact that another night in Germany was maybe more that their father could countenance. And you know what, we said, \u201cGee, this is a beautiful city, darn it.\u201d And so we have transmitted our children this, they are aware of it.

It -- It\u2019s -- it\u2019s not from the head, 1t comes from below, you know? So -- so th-that\u2019s the difference in -- when I\u2019m in Europe.

Because what we haven\u2019t touched upon, and it probably doesn\u2019t fit in your questions, but I\u2019m going to touch upon it now. Retirement started in Chapel Hill, here. And we literally touched the ground running and became active immediately in community work. And when I mean community, I mean the Jewish community. This is a very small Jewish community of no business -- no Jewish businesses, it\u2019s all academic or research or it\u2019s university or the research, Triangle Park and there\u2019s literally no Jewish businesses here. So when we came, there was a volunt -- a group of volunteers raising funds for the UJ and a bunch of volunteers having a program for some elderly people. That\u2019s all -- well, there was a Hillel on the campus and that kind of thing, was a Haddassah. But there\u2019s no organized communit -- there were two 3 synagogue. And I\u2019ve been part, from the beginning, of a creation of a Jewish family server. So, what I\u2019m saying is my -- this was my -- although at first I didn\u2019t know where to put my volunteer energies, it became -- I\u2019m what -- 60 -- 66 years old and of course I can take classes and I can do -- which we did, right away from the beginning. But I wanted to -- I wanted to be active and I wa -- vare -- I didn\u2019t know where to start. I went to Red Cross and I went -- and I went to the research [indecipherable] to the -- because I speak a few languages, maybe I could help them. But none of this was satisfactory. And then by chance I had met somebody who said, \u201cOh, there is a group that\u2019s trying to hire a social worker to get started with the elderly, because it can no longer be done on a voluntary basis and one thing leading to the other, before I knew it, a few years late -- a few years later I was chairman of the Jewish Family Service and I\u2019m still active on this committee. I was charge of the Russian resettlement program here and I\u2019m still in charge of that. We don\u2019t resettle anybody any more, but I\u2019m still active in that. And I am still immersed 100% in this. So, yeah, if you wish charit -- my empathy -- I was much -- it was much more satisfactory to -- first of all, it\u2019s my professional background that -- my skills came in handy 1n there -- than to go to Red Cross and when people donate blood to, you know, give them a cookie or something like that. I couldn\u2019t relate to that. And I was doing Meals on Wheels. I continued Meals on Wheels, which is not a Jewish program, for the longest time. But then it -- the schedule interfered with something 4 else and I dropped -- but for five years I was delivering meals to the general community here. So I don\u2019t limit it to the Jewish community."

And so both my husband and I -- he spent the whole day today at Hillel, because of some kind -- but thank God it\u2019s only 12 minutes from here, so he can go running back and forth. And that morning, the first thing I talked with the social worker and at Jewish Family Service -- number one I hired her, so I know her very well.

She said, \u201cWe had no business being seen together. It -- I was compromising you.\u201d And I compromised myself by being with her. And this is how our reunion took place, arguing over pastry. But then she told me how she got liberated. She was put into jail and knew that in the infirmary of that jail, there was a nurse who worked with the resistance. So her goal was to get into that ner -- infirmary. So she pretended to have a toothache, very bad toothache and she had two teeth pulled, two perfectly good teeth pulled and- you know, because she complained about it and all the treatment they had was to pull the teeth. And the nurse helped her escape. That\u2019s how it happened. So it took me almost 50 years to find out -- exactly 50 years to find out."

And on the whole, I think that in many ways, when I read -- there have been some studies made on the children, the hidden children. More and more there has been. It\u2019s interesting. The -- the first people to speak after the Holocaust were the survivors. It took them a long time to talk and they began to talk about their experiences. And then the children of survivors talked of their -- what they had in common. And it -- and other groups at different times. Now, for instance, there were also the children of deportees, that\u2019s more in Europe, that\u2019s not here, 5 because we don\u2019t have that many children here, of people who were deported. And then, only very recently, the -- the children who were hidden, sort of felt -- there\u2019s a whole group of them, they have something in common. And they didn\u2019t speak and I ask -- I know -- there\u2019s one here -- I mean, there are several here in Chapel Hill, but there is one I know fairly well. And she only recently came out of the closet and she say, \u201cI\u2019m talking about it.\u201d And she said, \u201cQuite often this was painful.\u201d Of course, she lost her parents while she was in hiding and then she stayed with some relatives and well -- came to this country, whatever, I don\u2019t know all the details. But she says also, \u201cSince we survived, we didn\u2019t feel that we had a voice in all of this. I mean, we were not victims, we survived.\u201d And now, all of a sudden, they feel they have something to talk about, because they indeed were victims and they have a lot in common. And so now there are the hidden children coming out of the woodwork. They have -- they had a big meeting of the hi -- children hidden by Ose in Miami two years ago. I didn\u2019t go to that one. And there is a newsletter and I\u2019m on the mailing list and I -- there 1s one -- a huge one in Israel. And these kids find they have something in common, because they were hidden and they had their losses and so forth and so on. And -- why am I telling you that, I lost my train of thought. Where we are at?"

            "answer": "Yeah, and that -- but -- a-and the studies, yeah, what I wanted to say is that there were studies made of how these children have adjusted. There\u2019s one I have from France and you know, they don\u2019t do any worse or better than the general population. They have their share of successes and of divorces and of failed businesses and -- and of successes. They -- they really don\u2019t differ statistically from the general population, not that the general population is doing that well in -- you know, I mean it\u2019s ver -- they doing very normally. And then -- and one -- as one of the surviving -- one of the hidden children in Paris told me, \u201cHey, we didn\u2019t do so badly, you know, considering what we gone through. Why do you think this is so?\u201d And I gave her my interpretation and I said that considering that what is very important is just after the very early years of a child\u2019s life, let\u2019s say the first -- some say it\u2019s the first two, some say it\u2019s the first two, whatever it 1s. Most of these children came from intact, nurturing families. And what happened to them, happened to the whole family and not within the family. So that they survived more psychologically intact, actually. If you understand what I mean? To -- children are -- there are many children today who are dysfunctional because of the pathology within the family. Because of parents who don\u2019t get along or -- or whatever it is, or parents who divorce or -- or all kinds of things that happen inside the family. What happened to these kids -- and -- and so they lose their nurturing, their loo -- they lose all the si -- sense of stability, they lose a sense of -- of security and what have you. But what happened to these hidden kids 7 is that they had good, solid years, early childhood, of nurturing and of -- of -- of -- of- as -- a Stable family situation and they don\u2019t perceive their parents as the perpetrators of terrible things. It is -- it happened to the entire family. And, if anything, they become concerned about their parents -- about the fate of their parent. I ha -- when we\u2019re finished with this, I want to show you a absolutely devastating book. I have a book, I think it\u2019s two telephone books of -- that are the children that were deported from France. The -- this put together by Serge Clarksfeld and his wife. Does the name mean anything? Serge Clarksfeld is a lawyer whose parents were deported and he devoted his life t -- he is the one who bought Barbie to France, he and his wife brought Barbie. His wife is German and not Jewish and they have devoted their life to hunt the perpetrators and war criminals. In the first book he wrote, it was a -- a -- Barbie is -- is very famous for rounding up a whole children\u2019s home called Eezure. It was not directly an Ose home, but related to Ose and we had workers in there. And here wa -- this was in spring of 1944, April 1944, it was almost over and he rounded up the staff and the children and except for one boy, who happened to visit there and was left off the truck because he was not Jewish, everybody was sent to Auschwitz. Nobody survived, none of the kids, except one of them -- one of the counselor -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure. But there is a mother of the children -- two mothers of the children with the Clarksfelds became active, first of all in founding rap -- Barbie and bringing him to trial and he was brought to trial while 8 we were living in France. And we were in front of the prison with each one of us carrying a name of a child, big, big, big panels. And what his job was -- became -- was to investigate the identity of each of these children and get as much data on them and pictures of them, so we don\u2019t say 41 children, you say, Bobby and Suzy and Eddie and -- and give them all a name and an identity and he published this book, \u201cThe Children of Eezure\u201d. And then he became to study the deportation list from France and cull out the children and try to find an identi -- when he published, all over the world. And he\u2019s put together the first of what he thinks is a series of books where he has pictures and stories about each one, and there were 10,000 children deported from France. So he -- 1t was published in France and there was an exhibit in the new school in New York and it was published by, I think the New York Press and it was available and so I got it. And they are not numbers, they\u2019re kids. And there you can see from what loving, nurturing backgrounds they came. And now I think this 1s what I\u2019m tr -- I\u2019m trying to talk about, what these kids went through, I just couldn\u2019t address it, I just couldn\u2019t prepare them. I had to move very quickly. Does that answer your question?"

            "answer": "Well, I -- I ha -- I had just learned to drive, I mean, in those days, we had one car, obviously, it was my father\u2019s car for business. I never got a ride to school or anything like that. We walked to everything or take the streetcar. So I never learned to ride it -- my -- and my brother used the car for -- help my father, he knew how to drive. So, my brother would take our car, but the neighbors, as I said in my story, the neighbors had a car. And the male in the family were in the army. There was nobody -- but there was a car. You know, there was -- there was transportation, they get out from under the German. There was nobody to drive it. So, I drove the neighbor\u2019s car. And there was a handicapped girl and a grandmother in there. And it was totally in character for me to do that, because I was a girl scout leader. In fact, I drove the car in my girl scout uniform, which in those days, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s today, was a khaki uniform, with a khaki hat with all kinds of insignias and badges all over me. And that gave me an official status, because -- I mean, sometimes I -- sometimes 2 myself, I wa -- I wonder about it, but it was in character for me to do that. And I remember as we were on the road, there were -- there was my brother, there was me and there was two other -- two other Jewish families from bila -- from that town. We all traveled as a convoy, with people on the road and cars and the defeated army -- French army and soldiers and va -- wagons and -- and at one intersection I was going to be separated from my brother. I didn\u2019t know where he was going. I don\u2019t know where we were going, we were going. We were leaving the Germans behind us. And I stopped the car and I got out on the road, with my khaki official uniform and I stopped all traffic and I went through. You know, was it out of -- I -- I -- I -- I was pretty determined girl or -- alway -- you know, I had already left, actually. When my parents were in Bremel, I went to take a job in Paris as a -- as a early childhood -- in - in early childhood. I was just 20 and when I got to the school there, outside of Paris, the concierge who opened the door for me, asked me what grade I was in. You know, I was very young. But I took a job in Paris and my mother took very sick and I went home and that\u2019s why I was home when the invasion started and it was a good thing I was home, because we were all together leaving. But I was teaching in Paris with the bombing trails and we -- we had -- we -- we -- we were in the shelters and all that kind of stuff. No, it was not out of character for me to do that. I -- I wish I had known how to drive better, but I got there. I got there -- I remember once we were going over some mountain -- there were mountains on the way and my car heating up and I 3 didn\u2019t know what to do. And the soldiers pushed me up the hill, you know, because they were walking alongside. We didn\u2019t move farther than -- we didn\u2019t move very f - very fast. And we kept on driving and every night by -- we had my grandmother with me, we -- we found some shelter. We had all the Shabbas food hanging on the car. We had it hanging over the car with -- and we found a bed for my grandmother, we -- and then we slept wherever we could, and we were going and we left everything behind us. And we ended up somewhere where we stopped. And this is where -- this is where my experience is very special, because -- in a sense that the people who were deported, I think didn\u2019t have that expulsion and that fleeing kind of experience. And that\u2019s the one that early on, kind of gave me that empathy feeling for [inaudible |"
