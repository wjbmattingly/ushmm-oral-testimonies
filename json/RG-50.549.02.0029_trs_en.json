            "question": "Okay, now, Dr. Chameides, I -- I\u2019d like to start a little bit -- just before the period that we -- we were planning to begin. Just at those -- those last days that you recall before liberation. Did you have an anticipation that something was -- was going to happen. What- Do you recall what your feelings were at thas -- that time just before -- Just before liberation?",
            "answer": "I think, first of all, I have to emphasize the fact that in 1944, I was nine years old. And I had been away from home for a little over two years, since August of 1942. And if you remember your feelings at nine years of age, it\u2019s very difficult to separate out, and to recall exactly what one\u2019s feelings were at that time and what occurred later and I\u2019m very - always very careful not to read in things that occurred later and attribute them to that time. I was in a small village by the name of Univ, which is near the large city of Lvov, now in the Ukraine. Univ was very close to the extermination camp of Belzyce. But I was hidden in a monastery, the Univ monastery was the mother monastery of the stunite monks of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. I was, by that time, a Greek Catholic in my -- in my approach really, but with fairly vivid feelings and recollections of being Jewish. And we, of course, knew that things were happening, because the front was coming closer and closer to us. There were the tremendous amount of warfare. The Ukrainian partisans were fighting on the German side and then saw that Germany was going to lose and there was a lot of confusion. So a lot of the village people were involved in the fighting, and the fighting -- the front came close and closer to us. We could hear it, we could see it\u2019s effects. I\u2019m not sure that I had any feeling in terms of that I was going to be liberated. It was -- There was a certain amount of excitement in the -- in a war coming, but of course we had been through this so many times before, that the issue then was primarily how to survive and how to get the next meal. I think those were much more of immediate concern to us -- or to me, at least, than anything else. For reasons I\u2019m not clear, we had one healer, I don't know whether he was a physician or not, but one person who knew something about medicine in the area, that I managed to become his helper at the ripe age of nine and we set up a -- a hospital in the church and we brought in -- the wounded were brought in from the -- and one of my jobs -- course, we had no medicines at all, and one of my jobs was after the battles, to run into the forest and to rummage around, find dead soldiers, particularly if they were German, because they would usually have bandages and first aid material on them, and get as much of that material as possible. If they were bandaged -- their wounds were bandaged, I would take the wou -- bandages off and then run back and wash them, so we could use them on the -- on the Ukrainians. This helped me a great deal. It taught me a lot and also, it -- it helped me because on Sundays, the farmers, the families would come and then -- and they would -- to see their husbands and youngsters and -- and I would always be around and so I would get eggs and cheese and milk and so there was food. So, we knew something was coming, the front was coming closer to us, the bombardments were more common. One heard a lot of shooting a-around and so we knew something big was -- was about to happen."

            "question": "Mm-hm. And then, a-a-appreciating the fact that you were nine and that you\u2019re not going -- going to recall, of course, all the details or even, you know, looking back at -- those number of years to exactly what you were feeling at the time, and appreciating that fact that you don\u2019t want to reconstruct something, as you just said, what do you recall about those actual first moments of realizing that something was really changing now?",
            "answer": "Well, unfortunately for us, again, in my position, not that much changed, because when the Russians entered, I was on the wrong side, because almost as soon as the Russians entered, which as I recall was in June of 1944, Stalin, as you recall, was a firm opponent of the Greek Catholic Church. The Greek Catholic Church was a nationalist church, 1t was very much bound up with Ukrainian nationalism and with a drive for independence on the part of the Ukraine, from the Soviet Union. And so Stalin, who eventually outlawed the Greek Catholic Church, imme -- almost immediately began persecuting the priests. And so, we would see now, instead of Jews being shot, we would see priests being shot. And so, one day, I had heard that there was a -- a horse drawn wagon going to be going to the big city of Lvov and I felt that I had to get out of Univ and so I took one of the younger boys, who is now in Israel. His name now is Oded Amarand, but at that time, his name was Dodo, and we decided we would walk to this nearby village -- I have no 1-idea of how much of a distance that was, in order to try to get this wagon, and on the way, we were stopped by Russian soldiers a-and a Russian patrol stopped us. And children were very often used as spies, so we were highly suspect. And I remember sitting in, behind a bush, crouched with my arms up in the air as this Russian was standing in front of us, not knowing -- with a tommy gun -- not knowing what to do. And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I talked them into allowing us to go to a farmhouse and -- which he did, and eventually he let us go back to Univ. A- And then, it was I think several weeks before another horse drawn carriage was going -- this time I think from Univ, if I recall correctly, and to Lvov, which is a ridiculously small distance when covered by car, but is incredibly lengthy by horse-drawn carriage. And I was able to get on that and went to Lvov, to the mother church, Santa Yura -- which is the Ukrainian for Saint George, in Lvov. And it was in Santa Yura, and I don\u2019t know how long I was there at this time, I don\u2019t get the impression it was a long time, but I really don\u2019t have a good concept of time, it could have been weeks, or might have been months, I\u2019m not sure. But 1-it was during the morning mass that I remember, which was celebrated by Brat Yosef, Brother Joseph was his name, I remember the way he looked, a bald head with a white beard. And he was celebrating the mass and in the middle of the mass, in walked two boys who were dressed differently than I was. But the dress and their faces were familiar to me, but I wasn\u2019t sure from where. I was dressed at the time in pants made of burlap, because we had nothing, and shoes made of -- of wood, soles made of wood, because there was no leather. And here come these two boys, who are already better dressed. They\u2019re in short pants, in a western style, better material. And that was -- one of the boys was my brother and the other one was a young man who is now a chemist in San Francisco. And they motioned to me and -- and I went with them and I remember going to have something to eat first, because we didn\u2019t eat before mass and so we had something to eat and -- and they took me out of the monastery. So -- So that\u2019s how I got out of the monastery."

I hadn\u2019t seen him in a -- two and a half years and at that age, there\u2019s a big change that occurs in -- in people. But I -- I think I realized almost immediately that it was. Cause I had thought about him a great deal while I was in hiding and the -- the Studite monks made a tremendous effort to always keep us separated, because they were afraid that if we were ever together, we would not only give each other away, but they were in mortal danger themselves, because they were really -- would -- would have been killed had it been known they were hiding Jews. So -- And I remember once, I was in Univ, in the attic. I found a pair of pants that I was absolutely certain were his and that were hidden there, but I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not sure the --"

            "answer": "I -- I don\u2019t think I had -- I don\u2019t think I had sophisticated thoughts of that nature. I -- I think clearly, you know, at -- at least at the very beginning, I missed my parents tremendously. I was terribly scared a good portion of the time. But -- But the immediate things were hunger, were -- were loneliness, were trying to make sure that one didn\u2019t give oneself away by either saying one was Jewish -- we were particularly marked because it - we were in a society where only Jews were circumcised, so I was always -- I had to be very, very careful, never go -- to go to the bathroom when other boys were there, never to bathe together. So, I was always conscious -- so it was this type of peculiar thing, where on the one hand, you know, I followed the ritual of -- of the Catholic church, on the other hand, I -- there was a conscious part of me, because I had to be conscious in order not to give myself away. But, I think children have an incredible capacity to adapt and -- and I think only those who adapted remained alive. I think those who didn\u2019t adapt or couldn\u2019t adapt, didn\u2019t survive. So, in a way, there\u2019s already a group that\u2019s -- there\u2019s a selection process there. [sneezes]"

But in -- What you\u2019re describing is -- is at least up -- up through parts of 1946, exchanged one oppressor for another, such --",
            "answer": "Well, not through *46, because this was -- we did not stay under the Russians til \u201846, so -- so th -- what I\u2019m describing now, is the immediate liberation by the Russians. And again, you know, I think every person, of course, is different and -- and adapts differently, but also, I think the age makes a big difference. I notice, for instance, people who were just a few years older than I, had different reactions than I did, because they -- I think you develop a sense of perspective and -- and -- and knowledge of the world, which, I think at the age of seven, or even nine, y-you just don\u2019t have. So, y-you have a different, you know -- you may develop the skills for survival and the skills for turning yourself into someone else and pretending to be someone else, but -- but -- but you can\u2019t put that into a perspective. So, I mean, to me it was very confusing, because my native language, my mother tongue was German. And -- And as I was a youngster, that was the height of culture. So -- So wh-when the German invasion came in, I thought this was great. Now, I'll be able to speak my language. So, you know, I was naive, I didn\u2019t know anything about the persecutions which had already -- I didn\u2019t know much about Hitler or anything like that. I was in a different age frame and I had a different, you know, perspective on it."

We, just to go back a little bit, after I was taken out of the monastery, we went to -- the person who was responsible for even knowing that we were in the monastery was Rabbi David Kahana, who became the chief Rabbi of the Polish army. And he himself and his wife and two children were hidden in the monastery. He as a priest, his wife as a nun. He wrote a book called, \u201cThe Lvov Ghetto Diary.\u201d And he was a -- He was good friends with my father. And, in fact, the two of them went to metropolish -- metropolithishipditsky together, which eventually led to th -- him hiding us. So, he knew of our whereabouts. He also knew that our parents didn\u2019t survive. And so he made it his business to make sure that we were taken out of the monastery, whereas, as you know, there were children, including a good friend of mine who was with me in Univ, whose parents not survive, who simply no one knew that they were there and they were just left there, and then became the object of a lot of post-war court cases for the community to try to get some of these children back. So, we went with my brother and -- and Nathan, who was the other boy, to Rabbi Kahana, and Rabbi Kahana told us at that point that our parents had perished and he had a -- a little note that my mother had written, which she gave to him for safekeeping, which he gave us. And then the question was, \u201cDo you know what to do with us?\u201d I was nine, my brother was 11 and a half and my brother had been placed with a family who had survived the war and there was a husband, wife and the young son of his age and they were willing to take him in. And they knew of a woman by the name of Tolla Wasserman -- her maiden name was Ashkenazi, who had been born in 1909, in Lvov and who had gone through the war, was hidden by her maid, she had a Polish maid who was able to cordon off one room in the apartment, very much like Anne Frank\u2019s thing, and they remained there for 18 months. And so she was the only one in the family who survived, she was alone and Mr. and Mrs. Frost, who were the people that my brother was staying with -- and went to her and asked her whether she would be willing to take me in, and she did. My brother did not remain with the Frosts, he -- he had a lot of difficulty in becoming a part of any new home at all, and -- and left, but I remained with -- with Tolla Wasserman from 1944, I believe November, until her death in 1964.

I think I have had, since then, and -- and before, a tremendous ability to adapt to reality, which served me well, so I think part of it may have been age, but I don\u2019t think all of it.

And within a few weeks, I asked her whether I could call her mother, which I did. So, we became very close. And she had no one.

            "answer": "Well, in -- in Lvov, if you remember, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin met at the altar and divided th-the eastern sphere and Lvov was given to the Soviet Union when the map of Poland was redrawn. Part of that agreement allowed former Polish citizens to choose whether they wanted to remain there or to move into the western part of Poland, and of course, our intent was to move westward. So, I started going to school in Lvov on -- in Russian school and I did have some education in -- in -- during the war, in Univ, but not a lot. So, I think it was the first time that I really went to an organized school, and then we were given the opportunity to -- to go by train to western Lvov -- to western Poland. We went there sometime in 19 -- I believe it was in the spring of \u201845 and we went by cattle car. Those were -- The only trains available were cattle cars. And there were horrendous stories be -- circulating, of people who had gone before, who would be going on open cattle cars, a distance that before the war used to take maybe two or three hours to cover by train, taking two and three weeks. And the Russians would simply stop in the- in fields and then -- and just refuse to go on. And there seemed to be no schedule, there was no control. Th-The war was still going on and -- and people were freezing to death in the fields. So there was a lot of fear about going on those trains, but we were very lucky for two reasons. One is that Tolla Wasserman, my new mother, had befriended a person - a doctor and each train had a -- one covered cattle car, which had a Red Cross on it and he suggested that we go in that car, so we had covering. And the second thing he did was, he bought, at enormous expense, a -- a bottle of -- a -- a case of vodka. And the first day we were out, the train stopped in the field and he called the engineer into this covered car End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B"

And the engineer showed his anguish and he said, \u201cI want you to know that every morning, I\u2019m going to take a bottle and I\u2019m going to throw it out the door. Whatever is left in that case when we get to our destination, is yours.\u201d And we got there in two and a half days, which is absolutely amazing. So that\u2019s how we got there, but now that I think back on it, we celebrated the end of the European war, VE Day, while still in Lvov, because I remember, we were living at that time on -- in an apartment on 15 Mawitskago Street, in Lvov and the apartment was deemed too large for just my mother and myself. So they billeted a whole slew of Russian soldiers with us. And many of the soldiers were wounded. There was a -- an elderly gentleman who was the father of one of the younger soldiers and then there were other young soldiers. Many of them had lost arms, lost legs and therefore they were taken from the front. And they had bought a case of vodka and mother said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to get drunk here.\u201d And she locked up the vodka. And then they said, \u201cNo, no, we\u2019re going to celebrate, because it\u2019s the end of the war.\u201d And she said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you, but if it\u2019s really the end of the war, I will buy you another case.\u201d So, we went out to the main square, because no one had radios, we went out to the main square and after awhile, Stalin came on the loudspeaker and -- and announced the end of the war. So the -- I think that was VE Day, so we were still in Lvov at that time. During that time also, I went to school, as I mentioned. I also worked after school in a cosmetics store. And I remember Russian soldiers used to come in and they would buy five bottles of Eau de Cologne and they would hit it against something, take off the tops and drink -- drink that down. They\u2019d drink anything that had any kind of alcohol content in it. And I was at that time already, very cute. My hair had grown back, and mother made sure that I was always dressed meticulously. And so, I reminded many of them of their own children, I think. So they would very often come to the store and after buying something, they would ask me to come with them for a walk or to come and drink beer. There was a hotel by the name of Hotel Georges, and they used to take me to Hotel Georges to drink beer. And then I would always go with them, and --"

Often wondered where the oth -- soldiers are. And then, the other thing that used to happen to me again, to show you the adaptability, is that the Black Market was the only way you could make a living. You couldn\u2019t make a living any other way, so everyone was Black Marketeering. And the Black Market at that time consisted of soldiers who were stationed in Germany, bringing stuff back from the west. They would bring stuff back from the British or the Americans, who would barter for -- for stuff, and then they\u2019d come back and sell it and then we would sell it further. And one of the big 1tems was, for some reason or other, mother of pearl buttons. So we used to get a lot of mother of pearl buttons in the cosmetic store, which was a state run store and those would be held under the counter and then people would come in who knew about it and would buy them. And whenever there was a raid or anyone would come, they very often would put the mother of pearl under my shirt, around me, because the soldiers were less likely to search children. And -- So I would find myself with mother of pearl buttons on a -- sewn on a -- on material wound around me. And one day they found it on me and they -- they took me to the Encoverdare, as the NVD was at that time called, Encoverdare headquarters. Mother came with me, she was very shocked and -- and she of course knew about it, but she was shocked that I was taken in. We went both. And no idea what was going to happen to us and the Encoverdare officer closes the door behind him and -- as we\u2019re shaking, and turns to us and -- and -- and says in Russian, \u201cVeehad sheety zheets, yatazhoy.\u201d \u201cYou want to live, I also do.\u201d And so he became part of the smuggling ring after that and he got a cut. And that was the end of that. So -- So that\u2019s what life was like, you -- you adapted to -- there was one other episode that I remember from those days, and that was that the elderly gentleman I told you about, the Russian soldier, yeah? I don\u2019t know when I say elderly, what I really mean. He probably was 40, but to me he was elderly."

I -- I had brought from the -- from the monastery with me, and -- my clothes that I wore and three items. I brought my rosary, I brought my prayer book and I brought a blanket with which I covered myself during the two years and I learned never to give up that blanket, because that was the only thing that stood between me and the Ukrainian winter. Somewhere, the rosary and the prayer book got lost. My very strong suspicion 1s that Mother threw them out. But I\u2019m not certain of that and maybe it\u2019s unfair to accuse her of that, but I suspect that.

            "question": "Anyway, please continue.",
            "answer": "So, the reason I was telling you this in a roundabout way is because of this old -- probably 40 year old gentleman who had came to Yom Kippur, to the Day of Atonement and as I said, I didn\u2019t know that, because Mother was really not very observant -- religiously observant. So, we didn\u2019t celebrate that at that time. But, he came to me and he asked me if I would stand at the door -- at the kitchen door and look out and warn him if his sons or any of his friends came. And I said, \u201cWhy do you want me to do that?\u201d And he said, \u201cBecause I\u2019d like to say some prayers, but I\u2019m afraid that they might turn me in.\u201d Because in the atheistic system in Russia, that wasn\u2019t allowed and he was afraid of his own son, that he would turn him in. That made a big impression on me and I remember it to this day. The reason I mention this, 1s that -- is that I think another thing that I was very fortunate in was that I wasn\u2019t thrown immediately from one religious experience into another. If I had been, my suspicion is that I would have rebelled. But, as I mentioned, Mother was not particularly a religious woman. On the other hand, she took a tremendous -- she had a sense of responsibility which she took very seriously, to make sure that I was brought up in a religious atmosphere, because my father had been the rabbi of Katowice and she felt an obligation to bring me up in the way they would have wanted. And so I did, later on, but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself, go in to go to Yeshiva and so on. But at that time, as I think back on it, it was very -- I was very fortunate not to have been thrown into a religious environment."

And -- And that we still had in Lvov, so it was probably in -- somewhere in the -- and I remember going -- it was in the spring that we went, so it was probably the end of May of \u201845 that we went westward. And the place we went to was a town by the name of Bittum. Now Bittum is in western Poland and actually is just a tram car -- street car\u2019s ride away from Katowice. So I came back to where I had been. And in fact, I had had relatives in Bittum who -- who had lived, before the war, in Bittum, were very wealthy people, owned a factory there, but none of them survived, all the descendants. But we went to Bittum because the other family that I had mentioned, the Frosts, with whom my brother was still -- he was still with them at that time, had gone to Bittum, and -- and so we went there thinking we would try to settle there, at least for awhile. The idea always was to come to the United States. Mother had actually registered to come to the United States before the war, but her number hadn\u2019t come up. So she was still hopeful that she was in line, in terms of the numbers and that eventually that number would come up and that we would be able to come to the United States. We went to Bittum and I started going to school, but it became dangerous -- not became, but it still was dangerous for Jews to be identified as Jews and the Kelsa program is of course, one manifestation which occurred later, but one manifestation of that. So, 1-it wasn\u2019t good to be a Greek Catholic, which would have been natural, because we were now in western Poland. So, I went to school now, and -- as a Roman Catholic and my name became Leslef Kusharetsky, because it was impo -- for me to have told anyone I was Jewish, would have been very bad for me. So -- So I became a Roman Catholic at this time, not that I was baptized or anything, but as far as my schoolmates were concerned, and my name was Leslef Kusharetsky."

            "question": "So then, you\u2019re -- you\u2019re -- by mid -- middle of the year in \u201845, you\u2019re now in western Poland, and -- and how long did you stay there?",
            "answer": "Well, we -- we -- again, we had difficulty making a living and -- and one of the things that everyone was doing was buying and selling and you\u2019d go to the market and you would stand a-and you would see something -- with a few do -- few zlotys, and you would see something and you\u2019d buy it and then you\u2019d move two steps further and you\u2019d try to sell it. And I remember one amusing incident was that we once bought what we thought was a lovely pair of shoes for very little money and when we looked at our most magnificent find, we found that we had been sold two left shoes. And here we were, having spent a fair amount of whatever we had on these shoes, hoping to make a good profit and here we had two left shoes. So, the question then was, how could we sell two left shoes? And the feeling was that a child would more likely get away with it than an adult. So my brother ended up selling the two left shoes to some other poor sucker, who thought he or she had gotten a bargain. But that\u2019s the way life went, you know and -- and- and so on. But the -- What happened next is that my mother\u2019s parents had lived in Germany and managed to get out of Germany in 1938 and go to England. And their son and dau -- two daughters, also were in England, s -- and my uncle, their son, they lived in Newcastle on Thames and in -- immediately at the end of the war, they began making inquiries about our family and found out that the children had survived. So they petitioned the religious council of England, th-the chief rabbi at that time was Rabbi Hertz, to try to get us to rejoin them. And there was a Rabbi Solomon Shunfeld, who was a strikingly handsome gentleman, with a red beard. He worked for the United Nations at that point -- for the UNRRA, the relief organization. He fashioned himself a uniform, which was a British uniform with a -- with a leather strap across his chest and -- and looked very, very elegant. And he basically made trips on behalf of the religious -- the chief rabbi\u2019s religious council of England, to Poland, in order to find Jews who had survived, to help them, to try to get children and see whether he could transport them to England, get permission, and they were able to get a certain number of visas from the British government. And so my uncle approached them to find us and -- and he in fact did and I remember when he came to -- to Bittum -- and that was in 1945, probably mid or late \u201845, to inform us that we had grandparents and uncle and two aunts and that they were anxious to get us to England. And my brother said, \u201cGreat.\u201d And I said, \u201cI won\u2019t go without Mother.\u201d And they had no permission for a visa for an adult, to they had a problem. They wired my uncle and my uncle said he wasn\u2019t ready to bring anyone else, but he wanted us, so they tried again. And I told him in no uncertain terms that there 1s absolutely no way in which they will get me into any kind of vehicle alive, and -- to go to England. So, he wired back saying that he would not participate -- he would not do that. And finally they got a visa for Mother. So, in the very end of 1945, I think it was December the 31st, of 1945, we left -- well, we first went from Bittum to Warsaw, stayed with Rabbi Kahana, who was -- then lived in Warsaw and every day we would go to the airport, because we now had permission to go to England, and every day we would be told that the planes were not flying because it was too foggy."

But they were willing to transport us. And -- So, for about two weeks, there became a standing joke, we would go in the morning to the airport, we\u2019d be back in the afternoon and then finally one day we went and we took off and we went to Berlin and then from Berlin, flew to London, where we were met by my aunt, and then took a train to Newcastle. And we remained in Newcastle for the next -- well, in England for three and a half years. Oh, when we -- originally they gave us a visa which was valid for one month\u2019s visit. But our Polish passport, which I still had, states that it\u2019s valid only one way, so, I\u2019m not sure how that worked. But when we came to the airport, the official said to us, \u201cYou only want to visit England for one month?\u201d And we said, \u201cWell, we\u2019d like to visit for a lot more, but we\u2019re only allowed one month.\u201d So he crossed out one month and he put three months. And I still have that document. And so every three months, we had to renew our stay in England and we did that for three and a half years, until our number came up to come to the United States. So this was now 1946, I was 11 years old and I came to England, to Newcastle, and started going to school there and I didn\u2019t know a word of English and I had to learn another language and then --"

And that is that they had an exam called the elevenses. When you were eleven years old, you took an exam and if you passed it, if you got above a certain grade, you were destined to go to a university. And if you got below a certain grade, you were destined to finish your education at the age of 14 and to the factory. And I arrived there just before my 11th birthday. And so, I took my elevenses, not knowing how to read one word, and of course got zero. And so, I was placed in a school that would have ended at the age of 14, in a factory. But, again, Mother had other ideas and -- and in 1948, she left Newcastle with me and we went to London and she got a job as a maid in a home on Goldessgreen Road and enrolled me in a Jewish secondary school, because you could avoid that whole system if you went into a private school. And so from \u201848 to \u201849, I went for the first time, to a Jewish school and got a little bit of a beginnings of a Jewish education at that point."

Mother was not allowed to work, that was one of the conditions of the visa. So that had to be done surreptitiously.

Now, I must mention that my brother had also gone to that school, but before me. And then in 1948, I was walking with him on the street one day in London, and -- and he said to me, \u201cI will share something with you, but you mustn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving next week.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere are you leaving to?\u201d And he said, \u201cGuess.\u201d And I said, \u201cIs it to Asia?\u201d And he looked at me and I said, \u201cAsia Minor?\u201d As it was known at that time. I said, \u201cPalestine?\u201d Shh. And indeed he took an illegal boat from France and went to Palestine and participated in the various wars there, worked in a lot of different professions and then was sent out in the embassy to Europe in 1956, and in 1956 decided that he had had enough of politics and international relations and everything else, and he went back to school and got a degree in physics and he got a - came to the United States and got a Bachelors, a Masters and a Doctorate in physics and then went to teach in Australia, but -- from England -- so we -- we came to England together, but almost immediately when we came to Newcastle, he went to London to school, and I stayed in Newcastle.

And, at any rate, we -- we left there after about three days, got in touch with HIAS and HIAS was kind enough to put us up at a transient hotel, which was called the East Broadway Central Hotel, down on the Lower East Side. A very meager, transient hotel. And then we managed to get a room on West 102nd Street. One room for Mother and me. And she managed to arrange a cour -- to take a course in baby nursing. Her idea was that every mother who comes home, needs someone to take care of the baby for a week or two and so she would take this course and -- and be able to find work, which she did. After a six week course, she found work and she would work for 30 hours a day and then have four hours off. And so she worked very, very hard. In the meantime, I -- this was in June, so it was at the beginning of the summer. It was a very hot summer in -- in New York. I had never experienced heat like that. But someone had told me about a school in New York called Yeshiva University, where I could get both a general and a Hebrew -- a thorough Hebrew education. So, I took a subway, went up to Yeshiva University and pleaded my case with the admissions office. They asked me what my background had been, what I knew, whether I knew any Hebrew, and I didn\u2019t. I had had that one year in London, which barely I was able to read, but that\u2019s about it. And they told me they didn\u2019t see how I could possibly keep up, that all their students had had eight years of thorough Hebrew education, that the language of instruction in the Hebrew Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection department was in Hebrew and they didn\u2019t think I could -- I could manage it, so -- but finally they decided to give me some books and si -- told me to take these books and study them, and come back in September and we\u2019ll see what we can do. So, I took them home and there was absolutely no way, I -- I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails out of them. I used to sit and try and it was very hard, I was really very discouraged. Came back in September and fortunately the registrar of the teacher\u2019s institute of Yeshiva University, Dr. Greenstein took pity on me and said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we try you.\u201d And -- And so I started in the lowest grade -- in their lowest grade, where everyone was already speaking Hebrew. And I remember my first word that I learned, that I could understand and -- and I spent the next six years at Yeshiva University. I graduated their high school at 16 and then their college at 20 and at 20 also received a Hebrew teacher\u2019s diploma, and a diploma from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in proficiency in the Hebrew language, and learned Yiddish and -- and received a Bachelor of Hebrew literature, as well as a Bachelor of Arts, before I went to medical school. So, it\u2019s possible. Yeshiva University was incredibly kind to me. I had a difficult time there, I won\u2019t say it was easy, I had a difficult time, but -- but Yeshiva University gave me a scholarship. They provided me with a card which was worth eight dollars per week, through which I could eat. And they would, from a financial point of view, in terms of financial help, they were -- I -- I really couldn\u2019t have gotten that kind of education if they weren\u2019t around, so I\u2019m very, very grateful to them and to President Velkin, who was always very kind to me."

            "answer": "I think there may have been, but -- but I think in Israel, the issue was more complicated, because in Israel, they had their existence to fight for. They needed heroes, they desperately needed heroes. And -- And the people who survived the second World War were not looked upon as heroes, they were looked upon as cowards, and as sheep who went to slaughter, this was the public image. And -- And that\u2019s not what they wanted to transmit to their youth. They needed power. I mean, that\u2019s why they transformed this whole thing of Masada, for instance, which when you think about it, Masada is as antithetical to Jewish history as anything ever has been. The hero of Jewish history was Rabbi Yochanen Ben Zacki, who, when the Romans surrounded Jerusalem and were about to destroy the temple and the nation, had himself snuck out in a coffin, the story has it, with his students following as the mourners, because they would allow coffins and funerals to go outside of Jerusalem, and he went and formed the Yeshiva and basically saved the Judaism, through his academy in Yavna. That was the hero. The idea that Jews would lock themselves up in a rock fortress and commit suicide, is a very un-Jewish idea. The Jewish idea is to sneak out and continue the line. It\u2019s not to commit suicide. But Israel needed that at that time. And people -- we build monuments not to commemorate what occurred, but in order to fulfill the need that we have at that moment. And Israel needed their paratroopers to go up on Masada. So, in the same way, Israel needed heroes to fight wars, they didn\u2019t want people who were going to slaughter. The other thing is that we have, you know, on my observation also, is that there 1s in -- 1n survivorship, and I don\u2019t particularly care for that word at all, but we\u2019ll use it, there is a hierarchy of suffering. And -- And in general, my story, which is fascinating to you, 1s of no consequence to most quote, unquote survivors [indecipherable] talk to."

A physician, not only highly respected, but you can take the job with you wherever you happen to have to go. And I think in those days, that was an important reason for choosing a profession.

            "question": "Okay, this is tape three. I wanted to ask you if you\u2019ve ever been back to Poland?",
            "answer": "Yes, we went back, I believe it was in 1991. But before I tell you that, let me tell you another episode which you just reminded me of. When I was at Univ, there were two other Jewish children, and I mentioned one of them before, his name today is Oded and I could not remember the name of the other one. I have a picture of all three of us. I knew that the -- one of the boys, his name -- I knew his last name was Amirand. I don\u2019t know why that stuck in my mind, but I knew it was. And over the years, I always wondered what ever happened to those two youngsters. I would give anything to be able to connect with them. And every country I would go to, one of my rituals was to go to the phone book and look at the name of Amirand, and it\u2019s an unusual name, and I never found it. A few years ago, I was in Tel Aviv, and I had previously looked in the Jerusalem book, but I had not looked in the Tel Aviv book. And I was in Tel Aviv, and I looked in the book and I found an Adolph Amirand. So I called the number and an old gentleman answered, and I told him my story. I told him why I was looking for someone and he said to me, \u2018As you can hear, I\u2019m an old man, I\u2019m 89 years old, but the person you are looking for 1s my nephew. He lives in Tel Aviv, he has an unpublished number, but I will give it to you, because I know he wants to hear from you.\u201d So, I called him immediately and he was very excited to hear from me. Did not, as it turned out, have that picture at all. In fact, he was younger than I and had -- his memory was extremely vague, but he did remember me, and we had a wonderful reunion. We made up to go to dinner the following evening and came to his apartment in north Tel Aviv. And his wife, while I was there, said to him, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve tried your Uncle Adolph several times today and there\u2019s no answer and I\u2019m worried about him.\u201d So he said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s go out to dinner, we have reservations and after dinner, I will go and I will check up on him, make sure he\u2019s all right.\u201d And I said to him, \u201cYou know, Oded, I don\u2019t feel comfortable in going out to dinner, eating, if he is an old man. Maybe you and I should go over there now.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Got in the car, we went over there. We come to the apartments, an apartment building on stilts, and as we go towards the apartment door, I don\u2019t know what made me do it, I said to Oded, \u201cDo you have a key?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me the key and let me go in first? I don\u2019t have a good feeling about this.\u201d And I opened the door and no one in, we went to a back room, on a porch and he was lying on a couch, in rigor mortis, had been dead for about eight hours or so. So, we sat down, we had to call the -- the mortuary and so on and we were sitting there and saying, gee, you know, if I had come one day later, I couldn\u2019t have found him at all, because it was unpublished, so, weird event. Now, Oded and I, after we had dinner and we talked about things and so on, we were both trying to remember the name of the third young man. Both of us remembered him, because we had his picture, but we couldn\u2019t remember his name. We asked a number of people we thought might know, they did not. About two months later, on Israeli television, they were showing the movie, I think it\u2019s called, \u201cLes enfants ont peride.\u201d French movie about Jewish children who perished in the monastery. And afterwards they had a panel and they asked Oded to be on the panel, since he had that experience of being in a monastery, they asked him to be a panelist, to react to the film. And, as part of his reaction, he told the story of our meeting and he showed the picture that I had brought him, and he said, \u201cWe know this boy is Jewish, we don\u2019t remember his name, we\u2019d love to be able to find him.\u201d Well, in Haifa, a man is sitting and watching television and listens to this and next day he\u2019s going on business to Poland. He goes to Warsaw and he goes to the Yiddish theater in Warsaw. And afterwards, is invited to meet the manager, whose name I forgot. And as part of the conversation, he says to the manager, \u201cBefore I came here, I heard this story on Israeli television. Do you know anyone who would fit that?\u201d And he said, \u201cOf course, that\u2019s Daniel Rottfeld, he lives two blocks down, in Warsaw.\u201d Well, Daniel Adam Rottfeld was in fact the third boy. He was, at that time, afraid to write me, because Poland was still Communist, so he got in touch with an uncle in Italy and suddenly I got a letter from Italy, telling me about him and the fact that he very much would like to be in touch with me, but that he can\u2019t, and the reason he can\u2019t is that he works -- worked at that time for the foreign ministry. Now, eventually, when the Iron Curtain fell and so on, and we could exchange letters, it turned out that Daniel was left in the monastery, no one claimed him. He was young, his parents had been killed, no one knew he was there. And when Russia and Poland made their pact, Poland took all of it\u2019s orphans and -- and moved them to the western parts, so he was moved to an orphanage in Krakow. He ran away several times from the orphanage, eventually found a sister and went to the university in Warsaw, received a degree in journalism and a degree in international relations. And became one of Poland\u2019s fine- finest workers in the foreign ministry, despite his name of Rottfeld. He didn\u2019t hide the fact that he was Jewish. And he led almost every Polish peace delegation. He was one of the authors of the Helsinki accords. He brokered the peace treaty and -- for Gorbachov and Muldova, and has written some 300 papers, books and so on, on international relations, particularly relations with Germany, of which he is an expert. Today he\u2019s the director of a peace institute in Sweden, in Stockholm. And so -- so I thought I\u2019d bring you up to date on how strange the world is."

            "answer": "Mm-hm. But you asked me whether we went back. Well, I think it was nine -- 1t was either 1990 or \u201891, I can\u2019t remember exactly. I received a letter telling me that the memorial would be placed on the -- in Katowice, on the square where the synagogue used to stand. And that a number of people of the former community of Katowice were going back to Katowice for this memorial thing. I got it and I tossed it aside. I had no interest in going back to Poland, I really wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to go there. But my wife, who has very good instincts and a lot of wisdom, picked it up and said to me, \u201cI think you should go.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy? What do I need them for?\u201d And she said, \u201cFor two reasons. One is that, since this is being placed in the place where the synagogue was, and your father was the rabbi of the synagogue, it would be very important for the people coming back, to have the son of their rabbi be present. And the second thing is that this is one of the few times you\u2019re going to get an opportunity to meet people who knew your family and might be able to tell you things.\u201d And as usually, she 1s very wise person. So we went and we offered our children the opportunity to go with us. Our boys refused. Our oldest said, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to step on the soil of Poland.\u201d Our youngest was too busy with something, but our daughter and son-in-law went with us. They had just been married. And it was a very moving ceremony, at which I sang the prayer for the dead. It was televised on Polish television and radio, was in all the newspapers. I did indeed get an opportunity to speak with -- with many members of the congregation who had come back, who were now elderly. We had had an opportunity to go to the cemetery and then - which is intact, interestingly enough and visited the graves of my great-grandparents and I\u2019m named after my great-grandfather, so I was able to reconnect with that. Did some research in some of the libraries in -- in Katowice. And, on the day I was signing out of the hotel, I\u2019m standing in line to sign out and an elderly lady, 76 years old, all dressed in black, comes up to me and says to me in Polish, \u201cBat Chameides?\u201d I look at her and I answer her yes. And she says to me, \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d And I looked at her, and she said, \u201cYour birthday was three days ago.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And she said, \u201cYour brother\u2019s birthday is September the 16th.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cmy goodness.\u201d So I said, \u201cYou must be Agnes.\u201d And she said, \u201cYes, Iam.\u201d And Agnes worked for our family as -- taking care of the children, for seven years. She was a young woman in her 20\u2019s. Now, she was an old lady, and she was very helpful, she told me a lot and she also brought me two pictures that she had, one of her and me and one of her and my brother, little pictures that she had kept for 50 years and that she gave to me. So -- So it was a very good trip from that point of view. We also went to Warsaw. Several years later, my oldest son came to me and said, \u201cYou know, I made a terrible mistake that I didn\u2019t go with you to Katowice. Someday, I would really like to be there.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, my wife and I -- your mother and I are going to Prague. If you\u2019d like to come with us to Prague, we\u2019ll be glad to take you and we\u2019ll take a train ride from Prague to Katowice,\u201d which we did. So I was able to show him. Our youngest son has not been there."

But - But that\u2019s about it, because you know, the synagogue isn\u2019t standing. I did go to our former home, but I didn\u2019t go up to the apartment, I just looked at the entrance, which didn\u2019t mean anything to me. The apartment might have evoked other memories, but a number of the people who had tried to go to their former apartments, who were in the -- in the group, were so horribly received by the current tenants, who were terribly afraid that they were coming back to claim them, and all they wanted to do was to see them. So, they were so horribly treated that I didn\u2019t want to put myself in that position, so I never even tried to go upstairs. So, I -- I didn\u2019t have deep emotions, I think, but --"

            "answer": "Well, I -- I -- I see it in two lights. There\u2019s no question that there is a universality to it, in that it shows us the capacity for evil in human beings and the depths to which people can fall. And I think this is even stronger because the people who did that, were such a cultured people. They had everything going for them. We wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had been done by people we admire less, or who had achieved less. But somehow we believed that great music, that Bach and Beethoven and Schiller and Gerta. The myth of western civilization is that these are the things that -- that conquer the beast in us and that civilize a human being and the shock is, they don\u2019t. That deep down, this is what we can- so there is a universal lesson that we all, unfortunately, have the capacity for that. At the same time, I think this was completely unique. And whereas the Armenians had a -- a major genocide against them, the uniqueness of the -- of the Holocaust was that this was planned as the -- as a decimation of genetic material. In almost every other instance that you can name, the enemy would come in, would kill off adults, they would take children and babies and raise them as their own. But here was a determination by a so-called civilized people, to -- to totally eradicate -- 1t was a pathological hatred to eradicate any sign of genetic material. For three generations, you were tainted. So if you were Christian and your parents were Christian, but you had a grandfather who was Jewish -- that\u2019s unheard of in any other genocide. And -- So there is a universal lesson, but I think there is something which is so totally unique, which we cannot quite comprehend, about this particular one. And of course, I read somewhere, I forget where, but I read that Hitler made the mistake of picking on the wrong people, because had he picked a less literal -- l-less literary people, people wouldn\u2019t have heard about the Holocaust. But he happened to pick on a people who write a great deal, who study a great deal, who introspect a great deal. And therefore, every other book -- you can\u2019t -- you can\u2019t pass a day without someone making a film or -- and you don\u2019t hear about -- that about the Armenians, or -- and -- and I wish we would, because if we had, maybe people would be more cognizant, at least about that element in the human capacity."
