I knew that I could be covered at home by older nurses who had children and whatever and I didn\u2019t see any reason why I shouldn\u2019t go and I felt I could be of some help, I guess.

Maybe a lot of the nurses that worked on the wards could tell you this, because they certainly got what information they could from them. And names and numbers, if they had any numbers. But I\u2019m sure a lot of them didn\u2019t even have names or numbers and probably couldn\u2019t remember. I know that there were -- I think more Polish, maybe they were Polish Jewish, I don\u2019t know, than there were actually just Jewish people. You see, this was quite awhile after the Holocaust, really. The Holocaust started in what, \u201842\u00b0? \u201843? And we were there in early \u201845.

You got your discharge later, but -- and I think at one time there was a choice too, as to whether you were discharged or just separated and I think, for some reason, I chose not to be discharged. And I think that I did this because -- thinking of retirement. Well, I was uneducated and in order to- to do this, you had to spend two weeks training a year, which I didn\u2019t know. So they recalled me, to make up I suppose for the time that I should have spent or I say should have, I -- yeah, I guess it would be. So -- and at that time, I was married, but I was stationed at Massachu -- in Massachusetts and eventually I got transferred to Fort Drum, which is very -- 10 miles within my home, I could live at home except when I was on call in the OR and that was probably two or three nights a week that I had to stay on call.
