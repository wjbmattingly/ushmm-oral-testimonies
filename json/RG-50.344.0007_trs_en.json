Maybe a lot of the nurses that worked on the wards could tell you this, because they certainly got what information they could from them. And names and numbers, if they had any numbers.

You got your discharge later, but -- and I think at one time there was a choice t oo, as to whether you were discharged or just separated and I think, for some reason, I chose not to be discharged. And I think that I did this because -- thinking of retirement. Well, I was uneducated and in order to -- to do this, you had to spend two weeks training a year, which I didn\u2122t know. So they recalled me, to make up I suppose for the time that I should have spent or I say should have, I -- yeah, I guess it would be. So -- and at that time, I was married, but I was stationed at Massachu -- in Massachusetts and eventually I got transferred to Fort Drum, which is very -- 10 miles within my home, I could live at home except when I was on call in the OR and that was probably two or three nights a week that I had to stay on call.
