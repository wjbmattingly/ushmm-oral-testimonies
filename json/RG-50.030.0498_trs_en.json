And they just -- some didn\u2019t want to give. Some didn\u2019t want to give. And some made me a sandwich, maybe, and gave it to me. But they were not- the farmers were not that generous. They were more generous, my friends in the ci -- in the town, than the farmers were. Like a potato in one, and something, you know. And I think to this day I hate the walking, because I walked so much for nothing, you know. Anyway, it\u2019s a good excuse. And so then -- yeah, we -- I was sewing, and I enjoyed it, different -- yeah, I know what I wanted to say. And they always had midday, in the morning, the kids all had something to eat, USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498 70 they brought there stuff to eat. Well, I didn\u2019t always have, you know, so I just walked out, because I didn\u2019t want to see, and yet I was hungry, you know, children. So once in awhile they would give me something, and -- but most of the time not. And then in the afternoon was the same thing. They were eating in the afternoon. And I had just enough for lunch, I didn\u2019t have leftover from. So I was hungry, I was always hungry. But they just didn\u2019t give, you know, so -- one day I was so hungry, and I looked every place in the house for something to eat, and all I could find was an onion, a small onion. And I bit into it like I don\u2019t know what. And I just ate the last thing in the house, that day, you know, the next day we got again something, but just to tell you how hungry I was."

You had to do your own bread, okay? Now, you made the bread, and there was one bakery in town, where you call them in the evening and you say, I\u2019m making bread, so they come and pick it up and put it in the oven. So my mother called in, went to them that she is making bread. So she says, okay, I'll be there to get it in the morning. So they made the bread, and then next thing you know, somebody comes to tell us, you better leave right now, cause five o\u2019clock in the morning the Germans are going to be here to pick you up. We don\u2019t have bread, you know, obviously, and one of our Italian friends USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498 71 gave us a bread, you know, to take, and my cat, my Muschi, she wanted -- you know, we had to leave her, so I left her with a friend. And it was pouring rain. I had open shoes, but that\u2019s all I had, you know. So anyway, we said okay, let\u2019s go. There was two more families there with -- actually three. Two of them in a different direction -- there was a couple -- like my brother said, somebody Russian. There was a Russian man, Russian Jew. He was married to a Gentile German lady, who stuck with him. They were like so tall, and especially I was so little, I thought they were two giant. But they were tall. And they went one way with another couple who had two boys from Vienna, they were from Vienna. And we went with a couple with two children. Small- little smaller than me, a boy and a girl, so there\u2019s -- they came with us, in the same place. So we kept on walking and walking and walking, and all of a sudden we were ready to enter the woods, and I hear a cat. My cat followed me into the woods. I don\u2019t know how she got out. And, you know, cats don\u2019t like wet, don\u2019t like rain, she came right in the rain with us. So, of course, with everything else, I had the cat, so I picked her up, I don\u2019t care, you know, I picked her up because I felt sorry for her. But later on you will see, the cat li -- saved our life. So anyway, I pick up the cat, and we go into the woods. We have no place to stay, and it\u2019s raining. We had like a tarp, and we put on the floor, and -- to sit on, you know, and it was -- we didn't have much food, the -- these friends gave us some bread, and I don\u2019t know, maybe a piece of cheese, I don\u2019t remember what she gave us. But whatever she wa -- she gave us, was wonderful. So in the morning, then we heard later, this woman comes. \u201cMia,\u201d that was my mother, \u201ca far il pane.\u201d Make bread. Because she gives you the signal when to make the bread, and then she comes and picks it up. Well, Mia\u2019s not answering, and she cannot understand, so she is knocking, and no -- I- that\u2019s what they told us later, she\u2019s knocking and knocking and she runs up, she sees something is wrong, and she finds we\u2019re gone. And 10 minutes later the Germans were there to USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498 72 pick us up. And nobody knew, you know, what happened to us. And this woman says she called to make bread, that\u2019s impossible, they have to be here. Well, somebody saved our life."

So then here they come to the door, the Germans to our door. And they say something in German, and we just said [indecipherable] you know, like USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498 80 we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. But then they say -- one says to the other, you idiot, you didn\u2019t kill the cat. Thank God. They were shooting at the cat, and as they were talking, the cat came running inside, see? So we were relieved that they didn\u2019t kill the cat, and thank God they didn\u2019t shoot at the men. But the men didn\u2019t know that yet, okay? So they left. They left. We were not important, they left. They saw there was nothing but hay there, and [indecipherable]. So then, we could hardly wait for the men to see -- so here they come, God, all in one piece, you know, with like -- but we knew we had to leave that place. So what we did, outside that house, we made room for our pictures. We buried the pictures, and my dad knew shorthand, and he wrote shorthand every day of our stay in the woods, the whole life he wrote in shorthand. So he put that down there, and pictures of ours from family, you know, whatever we had. I don\u2019t think there was money. Whatever -- anyway, we all buried it. And we figure, but -- you know, pretty down deep so it shouldn\u2019t get wet. And we left there, and we went -- you know, inside the woods a long different direction. And then -- trying to think, you know what happened first, it\u2019s hard to remember. Went there, and we buried that, and then -- and then we went on. Which was a big mistake, cause we got caught in the middle of shooting, the Germans -- and the French liberated us, the French and the Moroccans. And they were shooting at each other, and we were in the middle. Okay? The French -- we finally saw a Frenchman, and we\u2019re so happy, and he says, go away, go away. And we didn\u2019t know why he say -- tell us to go away. You know, you\u2019re so stupid sometimes. Anyway, all of a sudden we\u2019re just in the middle of all this fighting going on. And my poor dad and mom wanted to protect us, so they each laid on us. Dad laid on me, and Mom laid on my brother, so that things shouldn\u2019t hit us. We laid there for hours. And then finally, it\u2019s kind of stopped, so we kind of thought, let\u2019s go back to the house and get our stuff and get out of -- out of here. So when we got to the house, everything was -- they ripped the USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0498 81 pictures, whoever found. See, they thought maybe we had money that we buried. Mut -- somebody must have seen us do that, but they thought maybe it was money and when that wasn\u2019t money, they was mad, so they ripped things, you know. And so my Dad\u2019s -- all that writing went, and we lost a lot of pictures, which we were holding onto like dear life, okay?"
