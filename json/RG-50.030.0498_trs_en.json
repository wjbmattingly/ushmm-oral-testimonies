So my mother called in, went to them that she is making bread. So she says, okay, I'll be there to get it in the morning. So they made the bread, and then next thing you know, somebody comes to tell us, you better leave right now, cause five o\u2019clock in the morning the Germans are going to be here to pick you up. We don\u2019t have bread, you know, obviously, and one of our Italian friends gave us a bread, you know, to take, and my cat, my Muschi, she wanted -- you know, we had to leave her, so I left her with a friend. And it was pouring rain. I had open shoes, but that\u2019s all I had, you know. So anyway, we said okay, let\u2019s go. There was two more families there with -- actually three. Two of them in a different direction -- there was a couple -- like my brother said, somebody Russian. There was a Russian man, Russian Jew. He was married to a Gentile German lady, who stuck with him. They were like so tall, and especially I was so little, I thought they were two giant. But they were tall. And they went one way with another couple who had two boys from Vienna, they were from Vienna. And we went with a couple with two children. Small- little smaller than me, a boy and a girl, so there\u2019s -- they came with us, in the same place. So we kept on walking and walking and walking, and all of a sudden we were ready to enter the woods, and I hear a cat. My cat followed me into the woods. I don\u2019t know how she got out. And, you know, cats don\u2019t like wet, don\u2019t like rain, she came right in the rain with us. So, of course, with everything else, I had the cat, so I picked her up, I don\u2019t care, you know, I picked her up because I felt sorry for her. But later on you will see, the cat li -- saved our life. So anyway, I pick up the cat, and we go into the woods. We have no place to stay, and it\u2019s raining. We had like a tarp, and we put on the floor, and -- to sit on, you know, and it was -- we didn't have much food, the -- these friends gave us some bread, and I don\u2019t know, maybe a piece of cheese, I don\u2019t remember what she gave us. But whatever she wa -- she gave us, was wonderful. So in the morning, then we heard later, this woman comes. \u201cMia,\u201d that was my mother, \u201ca far il pane.\u201d Make bread. Because she gives you the signal when to make the bread, and then she comes and picks it up.

So I told -- you know, everybody, they are here. So the men got out of that building, which was him, his son, and my brother, my father, four of them jumped out of the building, and we didn\u2019t know where they were going, but out. And we quickly -- I put on a kerchief, you know, I made myself really look like -- all of us like farmers, we\u2019re all farmers. Course we didn\u2019t speak German, you know, or anything. And all of a sudden, we hear a gunshot. A gunshot, we didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know if somebody shot us, and we didn\u2019t know if someone shot them. So then here they come to the door, the Germans to our door. And they say something in German, and we just said [indecipherable] you know, like we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. But then they say -- one says to the other, you idiot, you didn\u2019t kill the cat. Thank God. They were shooting at the cat, and as they were talking, the cat came running inside, see? So we were relieved that they didn\u2019t kill the cat, and thank God they didn\u2019t shoot at the men. But the men didn\u2019t know that yet, okay? So they left. They left. We were not important, they left. They saw there was nothing but hay there, and [indecipherable]. So then, we could hardly wait for the men to see -- so here they come, God, all in one piece, you know, with like -- but we knew we had to leave that place. So what we did, outside that house, we made room for our pictures. We buried the pictures, and my dad knew shorthand, and he wrote shorthand every day of our stay in the woods, the whole life he wrote in shorthand. So he put that down there, and pictures of ours from family, you know, whatever we had. I don\u2019t think there was money. Whatever -- anyway, we all buried it. And we figure, but -- you know, pretty down deep so it shouldn\u2019t get wet. And we left there, and we went -- you know, inside the woods a long different direction. And then -- trying to think, you know what happened first, it\u2019s hard to remember. Went there, and we buried that, and then -- and then we went on. Which was a big mistake, cause we got caught in the middle of shooting, the Germans -- and the French liberated us, the French and the Moroccans. And they were shooting at each other, and we were in the middle. Okay? The French -- we finally saw a Frenchman, and we\u2019re so happy, and he says, go away, go away. And we didn\u2019t know why he say -- tell us to go away. You know, you\u2019re so stupid sometimes. Anyway, all of a sudden we\u2019re just in the middle of all this fighting going on. And my poor dad and mom wanted to protect us, so they each laid on us. Dad laid on me, and Mom laid on my brother, so that things shouldn\u2019t hit us. We laid there for hours. And then finally, it\u2019s kind of stopped, so we kind of thought, let\u2019s go back to the house and get our stuff and get out of -- out of here. So when we got to the house, everything was -- they ripped the pictures, whoever found. See, they thought maybe we had money that we buried. Mut -- somebody must have seen us do that, but they thought maybe it was money and when that wasn\u2019t money, they was mad, so they ripped things, you know. And so my Dad\u2019s -- all that writing went, and we lost a lot of pictures, which we were holding onto like dear life, okay?"

And he really taught me to dance. I was the first one on the dance floor, the last one off. He was terrific. And except that he was black, his features were white, you know? And he spoke perfect Italian. And you know, just a dancing partner. So my parents said, look, we\u2019re going down to dance, we\u2019ll be with you, I don\u2019t want you to dance with him all the time. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to dance with him at all if you don\u2019t want me to dance,\u201d you know. Fresh little me. So I stuck close to them, I made believe I don\u2019t see him.
