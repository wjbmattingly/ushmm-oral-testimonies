There was a lot of other people who were a little stronger, and they went around the camp and they start running, and they start saying, we are liberated, we are liberated, you could get up. Whoever lays down there who could get up, get up because we are liberate from the Americans. I never know just how the system works in \u2014 in the army, because I never was in the army.

In case God forbid something like this comes around, we should be united, which we were not united those days, because there were too extreme, and they all \u2014 and they forced us to be extreme and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t feel like being extreme, we just wanted to be good Jewish people.

Because they were so afraid you gon \u2014 you not \u2014 you gonna be a non-Jew. And I think that was the wrong way to force somebody to be a Jew, because you have to be the extreme way. You could be a go \u2014 a good Jew, and you could be Jew in your heart, and \u2014 and not to be the extreme way, to be \u2014 to God and to people.

I had be just in \u2014 in that place where in that town over there, where you could grow up a good Jew.

            "answer": "After I was in the \u2014 in Austria and Salzburg, camp name was Reidenburg, we prepared, you know, I mean people start moving out, they start going to Israel, start going to other countries. A lot of visas came in from almost all over the western world, that they take in so many people, so many people. And due to the fact my aunt, she wrote us we should come to the United States first, so of course you have to prepare yourself to come to the State to see, because like my aunt said, so few were left of her \u2014 of my sister\u2019s children, I would like very much you should come here first, but then you make your destination further. So we start preparing to do \u2014 come to the \u2014 the United States. There was a lot of visas you could go in any other country, like my brother-in-law went to South America. And I had friends, they went to Australia. They went all over the world, but my aim was now the United States. So from Austria they did not take people yet to go to the United States. So we heard in Italy this \u2014 it\u2019s a faster quota there, you could go faster from Italy to the States. So we went to Italy. We went some friends and we went to Italy. So, it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We had to \u2014 from Salzburg we had to go to Innsbruck. From Innsbruck \u2014 this is Austria, from Innsbruck in the area, to go over the border to Italy. So Italy was already independent, and they had the \u2014 watching the border there, and a \u2014 soldier were there and we were trying to go over the border, they caught us a few times. That\u2019s why I will never forget those Italian that time. They caught us twice, and due to the fact I speak Romanian, and it wasn\u2019t too much a \u2014 of a differential for the Italian, so I start talking to the guy, he ask me, where you go? I says, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m looking for a be \u2014 a better world. I\u2019m looking for the \u2014 to settle myself. He say, you want to settle Italy? I says, no, I have an aunt in the United States. He says, okay, but right now what we have to do with you guy, we have to send you back, because that\u2019s the rule. And next time we\u2019ll see. It just happened, the guards there, they saw what\u2019s coming, and they turn around the other way and they say, Avanti! Avanti! Avanti! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. So we went over the border, and we took a train, and we went into Meran, not Milano, Meran. This is then the northern part between Austria and Italy. So we went into that city over there. Of course, the Joint was there already. And from Meran they made arrangements, and we went to Milano. And also they had the camp there, only transit. Meran was a transit camp and Milano was a transit camp. So they, from there we sh \u2014 we went to a place not f-far from Meran, they called it Chiari after, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

In that they had a camp already established to go to is \u2014 to Israel, to go to any other place, or to United States. It was a faster \u2014 you know, faster \u2014 you get visa much faster over there to go wherever you gonna go. So I was in that place in Chiari for a little while, and then I heard that if you go to Bari, it\u2019s much faster from Bari. So we went by train, it took all night. The train were going a little faster than in Romania, so we went all night, we went to Bari. Bari had a camp which it was the \u2014 you could have stayed there and there\u2019s camps there, but there was another place not far from Bari, they called it Trani. And we went to that camp, it also was about five hours or so with the train, approximately. So we went into Trani over there, and we stood there for a little while, a f\u2014 months already. The whole thing took a year and a half or something like this, wh-what I\u2019m telling you, between Austria and Italy all those things. So when it came, there was a delegation over there, and they start taking all the refugee people to go to the United States. Now, it wasn\u2019t so easy to come to United States. First of all, you had to go through from he \u2014 head to tail, they \u2014 they checked you out. Well, they checked out you in general, and they find out \u2014 and they wanted to know if you have anybody sponsoring you. And wanted to know if you have a trade and the feeling, and all those things. And how intelligent you are, they showed something to look. And in books, something to figure out numbers like they do it for children now, they put it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I did put them \u2014 I could put them all together because the colors were so funny, I could put them together. So the bottom line, everything was set, and it \u2014 did they come that we are ready to go to the United States. So from there, from Bari we went to Naples. We stood there for a little while, I think they had some kind of a strike that time, so we hanged out to Naples. And \u2014 and then finally we had a boat, we had [indecipherable] a boat \u2014 matter of fact, they just brought some soldiers over to Italy and the boat was empty to go back, and the boat\u2019s name was General Greely. So we went in in the boat in there, and of course, after being so hungry all those years, I was watching to eat because I shouldn\u2019t get sick again. But I\u2014 I was always hungry. Matter of fact, I\u2019m even hungry now. I mean, I cannot full myself up from those bad days. So I went to the boat, we went in there and right away I volunteer to work. Because wherever I went in Italy, I worked. I made some money in the \u2014 all those places where I stood, I always look for a\u2014 sometimes I worked in the camp, they paid, because the Italian government paid for that. So I had some money and tell you, the first time I saw what life is when I was in Italy. First of all, the people were so nice. It\u2019s a different type of people over there, and so friendly and generous. And I had money, and I never know how to live, and this \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 tell you, this I \u2014 I know this 1s the best life what I ever had up til now, because all the \u2014 matter of fact, we went into \u2014 the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We went in, when we were in Milano, and there was a theater playing that time in this [indecipherable] Milano. I went in there and th-there was no room whatsoever, but due to the fact we told them we are \u2014 we are fr \u2014 refugees, so \u2014 which I speak the language already. We are refugees, so right away they made us at home and they took us in there to see the opera. And I was not much interested in opera thing, so I walked right out the other way, you know, they shouldn\u2019t see me, they made so much effort to get me in. So I walked out. And there was other places which I was interested and they gave us so much respect for the \u2014 because we were refugee, profugo they called it, we are refugees. Matter of fact, a lot of time you could have go from one place to the other over the train free because they know you are a refugee, and what you went through. So finally we go in the boat, General Greely. I said \u2014 they ask volunteers, I went to work in the kitchen, where the food is. So I went to work in there in the kitchen, and I was doing \u2014 in Italy I traveled around from one place to the other one. I went to a lot of place; I went to Pompeii, I went to other places. I went to see, you know, all the old places, and I went to Assisi. Well, ha \u2014 you name it, I went all over Italy to see, because I had an opportunity to travel. So I worked in the kitchen in the boat, I worked in the kitchen. And the third day I got so sick, I got so sick with all the food. Matter of fact, it\u2019s not only me, the whole boat got sick.

It was something. But I have some friends, they live now in Queens on \u2014 in New York. And just a couple of guys, they were standing there and they were laughing [indecipherable] and then nothing affected them whatsoever. So it took a few days pass the island of Capri, and the boat to come in. And a few days after we come to ourselves you know, and we start acting a little bit normal. But the boat, it was some kind of a storm, and you could see the boat, you know, th-the plates in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the mess hall where people were eating, you see, while they were eating, the soup was going one place to the other one, it was going back and forth with the boat and rockling the boat.

Some refugees were fr \u2014 they were Russians, from Russia they came. They were Polish, but they were in Russia. Some refugees [indecipherable] they run away from the Germans, and some of them they run away from the Russian.

So they \u2014 those organizations right away we had \u2014 like I had something written HIAS in my shirt, some people had different organization. So we had to go to the \u2014 each group.

And they waited me \u2014 they waited for me six months before they came, they waited for me. First of all, I could have come really before. I didn\u2019t want to leave Italy. I had such a good life over there, why leave such a good life? Why go away? But my friends told me, this life is good, but United States even is a better life. I say, what do you mean?

Could you imagine if you go to the source where you got all those things? And there how good it could we? So I let myself talk in, I say you are right and we came over.

So he takes the paper, looks in it, he comes to the station the next day, he throws it in the garbage. He says, you see, that\u2019s what you do in United States. You look in the newspaper, you have no time to, you throw it away. I don\u2019t even think he knows anything in that thing because he couldn\u2019t read at all.

So he says, but I\u2019m sure with your background, I think you could get a job over there and you could work in there, provided you like the grease and the dirt. So I went in the place for an interview, and the guy was talking to me in English, what the heck, I know English, I know a few word, okay, okay [indecipherable]. So he says to me, first I want you to go try my friend, he has a place over there and see if he could get you a job. So I went over to the guy over there someplace in Manhattan.

It \u2014 it \u2014 1t was a terrible thing, which I kept on saying I want to go back to Italy. I speak the language there and I had a job with the government, Italian government. And there was a disappointing \u2014 soon I walked down the boat, I was disappointed in my aunt, she didn\u2019t tell us the true, I would have be in Israel now, where I belong; in the army someplace, being a general, who knows? And so it didn\u2019t work out with that, was a very big disappointment. What I am very surprise and very happy, I could tell you I succeeded. In this country I did made it, in general, for one reason; because we pulled in the same direction with my wife. We married from 1953, and now is 1997. And of course everybody has a little quarrel back and forth, and I always back up, because I know she\u2019s right. So I always have the last word, I say, okay, what do you want me to do? But she\u2019s a great lady in general, and also she don\u2019t feel too good now, she has \u2014 arthritis developed in the \u2014 in the camps.

And whatever I do now, I\u2019m very happy in general, and my happiest \u2014 second happiest thing 1s \u2014 was the grandchildren, the family, and then when we go to Israel. Like I said, we go every year, and we see so many friends over there. And I\u2019m just delighted to see the way the country is growing and \u2014 and they cannot say now like they used to say, in Romania used to say, hey Jew, go to Palestine; hey Jew, you don\u2019t belong here.

And it \u2014 very interested that this man went through the same thing that I went through, and by reading all this thing of what he went through, I remember a lot of things. One thing, I was working ina\u2014ina-\u2014ina mine on \u2014 on a stone mine, we were working in the mountains there, and I didn\u2019t know what the heck they were doing there, the German. In the book I see they were trying missiles there. The German were trying the missile, the V-2, whatever they make. And there was other thing. A lot of marsh \u2014 marches we went, and we didn\u2019t have any direction. So he says in the book, we \u2014 we marched a death march to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And from there where he picks up the Auschwitz til the liberation, it \u2014 it\u2019s exactly what I went through, because he was in the same camp. And it\u2019s \u2014 it reminds me the thing, a lot of thing, which I couldn\u2019t remember. Like I was working when they had that mine working in there, in the mountains in there. And I was working for somebody there, for a German guy, a civilian guy, I didn\u2019t know his name. He puts 1t down in the book, what the guy\u2019s name was and it was very interesting to me to see it, which I have a copy and I treasure it very much."

There\u2019s a lot of thing I really forgot. I didn\u2019t cover everything what I wanted to say, because there\u2019s a lot of thing I forgot. So whatever I remembered, I said it, and I hope this thing will go out to schools and to other places. They should hear what happened, and they learn from it. And maybe if there is any problem like the skinheads or the other thing, then those kids will say no, no, I heard it from a survivor and I don\u2019t believe what you say, because it\u2019s not so, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really the truth that the Holocaust existed, which we all know that."
