This is a follow-up interview to a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum videotape interview conducted with Bernard Pasternak on April 20\", 1994. This is tape one, side A. I would like to have you speak to me today a little bit about your liberation and your post-Holocaust experiences. Can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were free, and no longer under Nazi control?",
            "answer": "Well, have to give me a couple of seconds, to turn the clock back, to tell you about it. The first thing on the liberation, I noticed a lot of noise and I didn\u2019t know from where the noise is coming. Then I heard people are saying the Americans are here, the Americans are here. But some people who were saying the Americans are here, they were from far away the noise, because inside on the camp there was still SS, try to get people up, to keep on going for the death march, keep on going. So I could not go any more because of wa \u2014 was very weak. I don\u2019t know, maybe have 60 or 65 pounds. So what I did, I saw bodies, dead bodies laying there, and I figure I\u2019m gonna go between the dead bodies, in the middle there and I had a weak spot on my nose, which all \u2014 blood always comed \u2014 it came out. So what I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak : October 22, 1997 did, whatever what I had, I hit my nose, and I fulled it out with blood, and my mouth was full of blood when the Nazis came around to try to drag the people out. So first of all, the people who did not want to get up, they shot them on the pla \u2014 they killed them. So when they came to me and they saw that I still have a little life in it, so the other guy says, don\u2019t waste your bullets [indecipherable]. So they kept on going. And then a little bit later, the Americans liberated, but they did not come in the camp. That was all on the outside. The thing were t \u2014 when I got up already, how did I get out there? There was a lot of other people who were a little stronger, and they went around the camp and they start running, and they start saying, we are liberated, we are liberated, you could get up. Whoever lays down there who could get up, get up because we are liberate from the Americans. I never know just how the system works in \u2014 in the army, because I never was in the army. The first thing when I got up, I went outside a little bit, I saw the American soldiers in there, and I was told that\u2019s General Patton over there. I said, who\u2019s Patton? I never know this \u2014 those kind of names, because we never heard it. And then later on I find out all whatever happened, how he came there and what he came there. And suddenly a few soldiers came out, American soldier, and they start talking Yiddish me. They say, are you Jewish? I say yes. He says, who else is here? I said, they all Jew, all around me, they all Jewish people over here. Then he start talking, and the first Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u00b0 October 22, 1997 thing they tried [indecipherable] chocolate, chewing gum, they tried [indecipherable] the thing was interesting, the chewing gum, I took a lot of packages in, but they \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 til it was sweet. And when it wasn\u2019t more sweet, I swallow it. Then I got sick, because I didn\u2019t know. And then the guy \u2014 one guy came over to me, another guy, he says to me in \u2014 in Yiddish, he says, you don\u2019t eat that, he says, that\u2019s [indecipherable] only chew it on the mouth. I said, I never saw something like this in my life. And nobody said it, so there was other guys who got sick from it. I must \u2014 I don\u2019t know how many packages I ate up on the time. And then we \u2014 we were \u2014 we get up a little bit and \u2014 and then more problems started in the camp."

Then it \u2014 it arrived the problem was what happened after. We were all \u2014 of course, we didn\u2019t eat for so long, and we were all hungry. And what was the bi \u2014 the biggest mistake, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u00b0 October 22, 1997 what happen. They brought in all the food the SS ha-had accumulated for themselves, and they brought it all in the camp, and we went there, you know, like \u2014 like \u2014 like hungry people, and we start eating and then the problem \u2014 nobody told us don\u2019t eat because the stomach is smaller. And we all sick, so we start eating and most of them died right in the sprot \u2014 in the spot in front of me. I got a flat typhus, and I was too \u2014 took right away to the hospital, and you know who treated me? A Nazi doctor, where he still had the SS sign on him, and he treated me [indecipherable].

No \u2014 nothing would have help it, just miracle thing, and \u2014 and that\u2019s what happened is the way we pulled through. Also, you pull through is the will \u2014 the will \u2014 the willpower to live, and that\u2019s the way it kept us going. We were a few people together there and we stick together til things got a little bit better. And then doctors Interview with Bernard Pasternak ' October 22, 1997 came in.

            "answer": "That \u2014 that hospital actually was a hospital for the SS people. And due to the fact there was a lot of prisoner of war who were Germans, they kept on running the same hospital, the same thing 1-it was, except in \u2014 as \u2014 how shall I say? Instead treating the Germans, they treated us. The hospital was overflowed and it kept on [indecipherable] more and more places and bringing more and more doctors to try to see \u2014 to cure us a little better. And all the medicine already the \u2014 the American provided all this necessary thing for the people to survive. Also, like I was mention before, the willpower to live, we had a lot of encouragement from the American \u2014 for the soldier, from the Jewish soldiers, who told us \u2014 they were speaking, so interested.

Most of them was the f \u2014 French soldiers, they were imprisoned, they brought them in prison, you know, they brought them to the camp, just a little bit before the liberation.

The reason, on the camp, and \u2014 in Buchenwald on the camp, and that s \u2014 it was some kind of a library, at \u2014 but the SS library. On that library walls, they put down names \u2014 I don\u2019t know who put on the names, how they got the names, they put on names who Interview with Bernard Pasternak : October 22, 1997 survive in other camps. So I looked around there and I saw my te \u2014 my sisters in \u2014 in another camp not far from Suico(ph). Now how do you get to Suico(ph) from Buchenwald, the one place, the other one? Then I find out that\u2019s the bus is running from one town to the other one, I had another friend who finds somebody there, and I hop myself on the bus, but 1t wasn\u2019t easy, the bus \u2014 the bus was so fulled up inside, there was no room whatsoever. So we went on top of \u2014 on the bus, on the roof, and we laid down there. It was in \u2014 in July or August, it was \u2014 1t was really so chilly, the weather was so chilly, was so cold, and we didn\u2019t have the proper clothing, but we were in the \u2014 1n top of the bus almost all night, a day and a night something it took. What did we eat? There was some food around. Those people who were in the \u2014 in the \u2014 they were mostly of the Germans \u2014 German people, not any others, so they had some food, and they shared some of us until we arrived in the place and destination where we wanted to be. When we arrived in the place, I find there \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name of this town, but I know it was Suico(ph), ou-outskirt of Suico(ph). It\u2019s Sachsen in Germany. So when we arrived over there, I went to look up, I went to the Biirgermeister and I wanted to find out if there is such a such people, where they are, because they were all registered. What they did there, they \u2014 also the American made the people to take in the refugees in \u2014 in civilian homes. So, due to the fact everybody was registered in town where they are, Interview with Bernard Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 because they had to provide food for them. So he told me yes, there is \u2014 over there and there, there is three Pasternaks. There was my oldest sister Rose, younger sister Raechel(ph), and there was another sister, Gitel.

We didn\u2019t talk about our mother and another sister, because we know they went straight to the crematorium because my mother was sick, and with the little sister. That\u2019s the first question, we tried to figure out a way. And then I had another brother, and I wanted to find him. His no \u2014 his name was Azreal(ph), so we wanted to find him, so we didn\u2019t know where to start looking. And we were in that camp a little while, and I wanted \u2014 and \u2014 and it was \u2014 it \u2014 it really was some kind of a barracks too, after \u2014 after \u2014 when we went out from the civilian, we went in a little barrack because we were ready to be \u2014 to go back into Germany. It\u2019s the reason it \u2014 because that time the allies, they made some agreement with the Russians, that the Russians gonna Interview with Bernard Pasternak : October 22, 1997 come over to Suico(ph) and they gonna divide something [indecipherable] I heard something or \u2014 and \u2014 and that means, the next day, we will be in Russian zone, not in the American zone. It was very interest at that time, we didn\u2019t want to move from there because we wanted really to go straight home to find out who else is alive, and who else we could get reunited. So there was again, soldiers, American soldiers. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know their rank, and they say okay, let\u2019s back up \u2014 in Yiddish, he say let\u2019s back up and \u2014 and go. We going \u2014 we going in to Germany, we going to Frankfurt. I say why? I have it so good over here, for now. I\u2019m gonna ma \u2014 we gonna make all the arrangement, and \u2014 and we gonna go back for my [indecipherable] which it was Transylvania, Mamurish(ph) and Oybarishu(ph), he called it a different name [indecipherable] Yiddish they called it Visho(ph). So I wanted \u2014 so the \u2014 the \u2014 the f \u2014 captain, whatever he was, he had \u2014 he had some stars on the time, was to be a captain. He says to me, you know, you people making a mistake. You just got liberated, and you gonna stay here. You know who\u2019s \u2014 who\u2019s gonna take you over? The Russians. I say look, when we were kids, they told us the life in Russia is so good, he say, you only work and you get everything for nothing. So, you would have no pro \u2014 I mean, we would have no problem, I says, nothing\u2019s wrong with \u2014 with them \u2014 to stay over there and to wait for them. He says, don\u2019t tell me \u2014 don\u2019t say it I didn\u2019t tell you, I didn\u2019t warn you. He say goodbye. The next day, Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u00b0 October 22, 1997 the Russian came in and they \u2014 first of all, that ca \u2014 that barracks over there mus \u2014 was only women. | think me and my friend was the only man, well a \u2014 maybe \u2014 I would say over a hundred girls [inaudible]. Soon that guy comes in and from us \u2014 there was people from Czechoslovakia, there \u2014 Jewish people from there, and they speak the language, the Russian language. The first thing the Russian came in they said, if you people don\u2019t behave, we send you to Siberia. That guy who told \u2014 talked to us about the \u2014 th-this way, he had a couple of spoon in his boots, dirty all around. I couldn\u2019t figure out, I says to friends there, I says, that\u2019s the Russian? That\u2019s what they told it to so good, and all the good thing it\u2019s in there? And he said, that\u2019s the Russian. Now, we had to be very careful not to say anything because th- they were drunk, right away they were drunk. I saw guys, they had two, three watches in th \u2014 in their hand, taking them from other people. So we \u2014 now we were \u2014now we had a problem, tried to \u2014 we should get back to the American zone, but we could not do it. So what we did, we made the arrangement, like I said before, and we went back to Romania. It wasn\u2019t such an easy trip to go back. First of all, we had to get out from Germany, we went into Czechoslovakia, to Prague. We also went with the train. And this was all Russian controlled zone. Those people acted like wild animals, like you see the wild kingdom of the animals. What di \u2014 what did they do? First of all, I saw right away that I am dealing with the devil. So, Interview with Bernard Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 I removed \u2014 I was in \u2014 on one car, one boxcar, I was with some girls, with the girls, like I was saying there was girls. So I says to my sister, first thing I gotta do, I gotta remove the locks. I took the locks off on both side, they should not be able to come in. They were banging all night to come in and to try and rob the people, rape the people, whatever they did. The next day after the night, we \u2014 we got to a station, we got some water there. It was in Czechoslovakia. What happened, I find out what the Russian dids. They were acting unhuman to those girl, the skeletons girl, they were acting. They \u2014 even they had something like a watch or something, they took everything from them away. They were riding also on top of the \u2014 on that \u2014 on the train, and the bridges were low over there, most of them got killed on the spot there, because they were \u2014 they were drunk and standing up there, and they falled off. So from there, after I saw right away the situation again, so the girls come over to me, they say, you saved our lives. I was there with my other friend in there, he says you saved our lives because you \u2014 smart thing to do is to remove the locks, they shouldn\u2019t be able to come in. And then we arrived in \u2014 in Prague, we were there a few days, it to \u2014 it took quite awhile to get for the train there to Prague. And in Prague we were a few days. There was already, I think the Jewish organizations; the first time I saw Jewish organizations try to talk us and try to help us go further."

            "answer": "The \u2014 the Joint. That time was the Joint. So they were a \u2014 also I saw \u2014 I was very surprise to see also people of the Jewish organizations from South Africa. Of course, I learned about South Africa [indecipherable]. There was a woman soldiers, Jewish girls, women soldiers, speaking Yiddish 1n such a funny accent, I never \u2014 never heard something \u2014 I couldn\u2019t figure out \u2014 even I understand, which I \u2014I didn\u2019t speak any English, I couldn\u2019t understand the way they were talking. But m \u2014 the products \u2014 1-1t\u2019s too \u2014 it was the Joint, but most of the [indecipherable] it \u2014 it was written on the can, I\u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m a tuna, you know, a gift from the South African Jews, Johannesburg. I could see the label in \u2014 in front of my eye, there was written. And they made us very comfortable over there and they tried to get us further dow \u2014 further to \u2014 to get to our desin \u2014 destination. So from Prague we took another train, of course. Some people \u2014 not with the same people, some people, they went on different direction. We went into Budapest. We sto \u2014 in Budapest I had very little problem, because Czech, I didn\u2019t speak that language, but in Hungary I speak the language, so we didn\u2019t have \u2014 we had very little problem. Also there was also the Jewish organization like the Joint. I didn\u2019t see the South Africans there, there was only the Joint, the American. And they took over a place, they call it Adjibat(ph) school. There was a school there and the name was Adjibat(ph) and they \u2014 there was a lot of food already, kitchens over there, setting up. But you Interview with Bernard Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 couldn\u2019t go out on the street because they were looking for Nazis, the \u2014 the Russians were looking for Nazis so they had the Hungarians with the \u2014 going around with them. And the \u2014 and they know right away, there\u2019s not the \u2014 don\u2019t look Hungarian because the way you walk, the way you eat, the way the thing, right away they point it out from you. So the Russians gave in the documents that we are re-refugees in Budapest. We also got documents in Prague, which I have them right here. And the reason I| kept all those documents from wherever I went, they gave us a paper and I kept it. I also got the papers from the liberation from Buchenwald from the U.S. Army, which I have it here in my possession. For all those year, I carried that. So in Budapest, I went out in the street, I felt like home, you know, we went out, we took a walk. I find one guy which e \u2014 he was our neighbor, and he was in the Czech army that time. And we walked, we kept on talking, we walk in the street there and finally we saw one guy \u2014 two \u2014 two people, not one, but one guy we recognized. I said, is it the chief of the police of our town? You know what this guy did with him in my \u2014 thi \u2014 this person who I \u2014 I know from home? He \u2014 first he beat the hell out of him, and the Russians came around, there wa a lot of soldiers, they came around and they seen what\u2019s going on, they didn\u2019t intervene at all, til the guy got ready, and then he s \u2014 he says to the Russian, he said, this is the guy, when we were in the ghetto in the \u2014 and boxcars used to come in Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22, 1997 with potatoes or other kind of food for the ghetto, so this guy took away all the food, he gave it to the local people and to us, when it \u2014 in the bottom on the train there was dirt, he said, this is for the Jew. And then this fellow, the Jewish guy, he picked up the \u2014 the Czech soldier and he pu \u2014 picked up a lot of dirt from the floor and he fulled up his mouth, he says, this is the dirt what you told us to eat, now you eat the dirt. And after a few days, we decided we are going to see whoever\u2019s alive. It\u2019s about five an \u2014 500 kilometer from Budapest to our destination. When we got \u2014 it was easy to get, you know, the \u2014 the traveling that I \u2014 the trains used to go maybe 20 miles an hour, the whole train, even the \u2014 it was written 1n the car they go 40 mile, they only go about 20 mile. Sometime you could run faster than the trains, the way they had those trains. And we got home to our destin \u2014 destination, the Oybarishu(ph) Mamurish(ph). We came home, and of course the \u2014 it was a very interesting place. First of all, on the da \u2014 this place, before th-they call it Rishu(ph), it was Austria-Hungary before the first World War. On the fir \u2014 on the W-World War first after, they \u2014 the Romanian took it over. In 1940, the Hungarians took it over. So we were shoved to one \u2014 from one to the other one. When the Hungarians went \u2014 when it was Austro-Hungary, that wasn\u2019t a bad place to live, and to \u2014 it was pretty good over there, because there was a lot of wood, and the Hungarians, the Austrian didn\u2019t have so much wood, the tree, so it was not a bad life. But when Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22, 1997 the Romanian came in, and the Romanian had a lot of wood, so life got deteriorated, it was \u2014 it was such a good, I mean, people were suffering a lot. And when we arrived in the \u2014 on the \u2014 1n the town and the city, manufactured was [indecipherable] city with \u2014 of three \u2014 4,000 Jews in there before the war. When we arrived there, we find a couple of Jewish families in there and we tried to see how we could do something, and tried to build up our lives \u2014 put together the life. But we really couldn\u2019t make it out. We try all kinds of business, we\u2019re trying to bring in store from one \u2014 from one place to the other one, tra \u2014 traveling to the towns, things like this, and the bottom line, we couldn\u2019t make out."

            "answer": "We - we really \u2014 it wasn\u2019t too bad even before we le \u2014 we got along with the Romanians pretty good. It was a city from Romanians, Hungarians, Germans. We had our own, you know, like neighborhoods. This was a German neighborhood, there was Hungarian. But really 1-1t wasn\u2019t that bad before the war with those people, we got along pretty good. But th-the \u2014 the thing is, with the Germans it was another \u2014 another ball game that time because they \u2014 they went \u2014 they called it [indecipherable] they all went to the German army, they all went to the SS army. And of course, that was not, you know, good cooperation with them. So when I was Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u201c October 22, 1997 \u2014 we \u2014 when we were in Viseu, so our first thing, we find our brother in there. He was in the Hungarian army as a laborist. And we find him over there already, but we couldn\u2019t make ends meet over there. So I was there with my \u2014 my brother Azreal(ph), and I was there with my sister Rose and Raechel(ph) and Gitel. But the most interested thing, my sister was married before the war, and my brother-in-law came back and they got reunited again in Viseu in the same town. So \u2014 but there was no more futures because I saw a different type of life after, whenever you travel one city to the other one, and the life in \u2014 in the town was so backwards. So there was really nothing more we could do. So we made preparation. We tried to sell thing, but to who you gonna sell? Because when we came home, most of the houses was robbed. They took everything away, the local people. Even we got along with them nice, but they still, you know, they still tried to get something for nothing and they came down \u2014 they used to live out of town, they came down in the town, they occupied all the Jewish houses in there, and it was no life whatsoever. So our mind was just to get out of there, and to see what we could start up new."

We didn\u2019t know he was in Theresienstadt, we had \u2014 couldn\u2019t find out what camp. Then there was a barber, he was a avrum(ph) de barbera(ph) they called in town. He was a very good friend my father, and then he told us the tragedy what happened. My father knows horses, and he had a friend, he was working in a drugstore, and due to the fact there was a very good combination, and the Germans give him the job taking care of their horses. And then the next day or so, that time it was very big bombardment, they wiped out the camp, right, and my father and his friend Drogas(ph), th-they both got killed. And it was the first day of Chol HaMoed Pesach, and that\u2019s the day we are keeping the Yahrzeit, because we know exactly what the day and \u2014 and the Yahrzeit for my mother, my sister, we keep the first day of when we arrived in Auschwitz, that was [indecipherable]. And we \u2014 it\u2019s actually picked a day, because we don\u2019t know exactly when they went to the crematorium, but according to the rabbi, they told us that when you arrived, that\u2019s the day that you gotta keep the Yahrzeit. But therein \u2014 then, after we find out about our father, so there were no more hope in there, and no more thing, so try to go back from where we came, to Germany, to the American zone, we know we have family in the United States and other family in other areas. So we tried to go Interview with Bernard Pasternak _ October 22, 1997 back because we already heard that they have there DP camps they opened in Austria and Germany and other places. So we go in in that camp and from there probably we\u2019ll be able to go into our \u2014 another country because we have nothing to do any more in here, it\u2019s all washed out. Now, going back wasn\u2019t so easy, it was very hard to go back. First of all, we had to have money to travel, you couldn\u2019t do it. We had a few things, but we hardly got anything for it. So we start traveling, we went back to one city, they call it [indecipherable]. We went over there with the train. From there we had to go in on the \u2014 to the Czechoslovakia side again, in the Allneek(ph) Javorkt(ph) mountains. We went \u2014 they shouldn\u2019t catch us, the Russian, because if they catch you, they were controlled with Russian, [indecipherable] Russian they get you, then like they said, they take you to Siberia(ph). So we went to Czechoslovakia. From there we had to cut into Hungary, also during the day \u2014 it was summer \u2014 during the day we were sitting on the high grasses, lay down over there, because there was a lot of Russian patrols, and a lot of them got caught. And then we went, little by little, til we arrived to Hungary. We went over to Hungary, back to Hungary, and when we arrived there, also we \u2014 they caught us, because a lot of people, they were talking, and you\u2019re not supposed to talk. And they \u2014 that time was the corn harvest, we were sitting in there, and at night we start running again. We \u2014 we went one place, we Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u00b0 October 22, 1997 had a few dollars that time, we sold something. And there was a guy who used to take over from \u2014 who took over the water there with the boats, something [indecipherable] from one place to the other one, so we gave him a few dollar, he took us over in the other side, on the Hungarian side. And then we took a train over there. The train which \u2014 the train will go to Budapest. Now also that train was so full of people, local people, there was no place what to put nothing. We also find out that Hungary has no salt. There\u2019s no salt over there. So we took a few bags of salt, and we \u2014 to take it back to Hungary, because that was a big commodity over there. Oh, actually, the salt we had for nothing, because Romanian had so much salt, which it was no problem. When we took the train, we also had to go on the slate roof. We had to go on the slate roof and lay down there, you know, to keep on going, which it took a few days from one area til we are \u2014 til we got to Budapest. Now who was there? It was there was my brother Areal(ph) and again my older sister with her husband, they remained behind. They \u2014 they decided they not ready to go back yet. So it was my other two sister, my brother and myself. So we stood on that slate roof over there, also the bridge, 1t was so low you had to keep your head down. And a lot of time, you know, the way those trains were going, it\u2019s not like a train, you know, it was shaking you back and forth and throwing you around. Then finally we arrived in a\u2014 in Budapest. And from there, there \u2014 there was Interview with Bernard Pasternak a October 22, 1997 already \u2014 the Joint was there, and put us up there temporary places. We also had to give for the Hungarian newspaper, we had to give interviews to them what happened. And we stood there about a week or so, and then \u2014 the be \u2014 the Bricha, the Jewish orga \u2014 the Jewish Bricha from \u2014 from that time of Palestine. So what the Jewish Bricha from Palestine, working already to try to help people from destination, one the other one. So the bi \u2014 Bricha brought us over to our destination close to the Austrian border. I forgot to tell the name of the \u2014 of the city over there. And from there, the Bricha, they wanted we \u2014 we should go \u2014 we should go further. Th-The destination supposed to be Pa-Palestine that time. So, when we arrived in Saulfil(ph), Soulfil(ph) \u2014 something \u2014 so when we arrived over there in that place, of course we had to cross over to Austria. Now, how do you cross to Austria, because it was all Russians, all around. And then what the border was, it\u2019s so tight, I mean with soldier, that he couldn\u2019t go through at all over there, even through the fields, and more than it was in Hungary and Romania and Czechoslovakia. So w- we sold a few things, a few \u2014 first of all, we sold the salt that we already had, about 50 dollar that time for the salt, 1t was such a commodity. Must have schlepped maybe 200 kilo of salt, between all of us. We had about 50 dollar already. Well, we arrived over there in this place, so they told us, the only way you could go past there, if you have to go, they have to take you over the border. We find out there is Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u201c October 22, 1997 a guy, a Russian guy, a driver, he had a truck there, his name was Sashka(ph). We talked to him \u2014 I mean, I didn\u2019t talk, because I didn\u2019t speak Russian. So there was people who talked to him, and finally he agreed I think five dollars for each of us. We wanted to give him shillings, Hungarian money, but we \u2014 because that was easy to get. He says no, he says, nyeda(ph) shilling, nyeda(ph) \u2014 dollare(ph), dollare(ph). So finally we give him five dollar each, still had a few dollar left, and he fulled up the truck, a open truck. He says, all \u2014 everybody lay down in the truck. We come to the border and the Austrians, they try to stop us with some soldier guard. You know what the guy did? He went right over them. He kept on going like \u2014 like nothing, he didn\u2019t care who stopped him or what, because there was \u2014 to him was no border. And \u2014 and he took us in to \u2014 we passed Wiener Neustadt, and we arrived in \u2014 in \u2014 in Vienna. In Vienna. We atrived in Vienna, that was the destination."

I would say it was summer, and really it could be in September sometime, August, September, because we didn\u2019t stay too long, we got liberated May, and August, September, maybe October, we arrived in th \u2014 1n there. From there \u2014 when we arrived to Vienna, we already had some helping, people helped us Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u201d October 22, 1997 and they told it, there 1s the Rothschild hospital, which they used that hospital Who are they? They \u2014 the \u2014 the Bricha from \u2014 from Palestine, they used that hospital. Of course, who paid? The Joint paid. The American Jew paid for that. So we used the hospital for all the refugees who got together. Now, Vienna you couldn\u2019t get out just like this, because Vienna \u2014 Vienna had the four zone over there. And we were on the American zone. Now how you gonna get \u2014 you couldn\u2019t even go from one zone to the other one. Now how you gonna go 1n, and all \u2014 everybody wanted to go to the American zone because that was the right place to go 1f you wanted to emigrate, or even they had the French zone, the English zone, they didn\u2019t count munch \u2014 much in that, they didn\u2019t care too much about the other zone. So it was very interested when you are in the \u2014 in the hospital, in the Rothschild hospital, they \u2014 the Joint, with the Bricha together, they \u2014 their leaders, they rented a truck, a big truck and they made it special for \u2014 for \u2014 for people to be able to sit down in the \u20141n the side of the truck. And we should go from Vienna, we should go to Linz. Linz is in Austria. Of course Linz was already the American zone. There was a bridge over there, and that divided between the Russian and the American zone. When we got to \u2014 when we got f\u2014 we \u2014 we got on the way, you know, we \u2014 so what happened in the mountain, the truck had an accident, banged with another truck. I hit so bad my arm there, and ripped off the r \u2014 the roof, everything, and we couldn\u2019t Interview with Bernard Pasternak * October 22, 1997 go further. So then we have to take a train. So we come with the train, they fulled up the train with so many people from the camps, ma \u2014 from other camps together [indecipherable] of three, because everybody want to run away. And we got with the train, we got by the border by Linz, the Russians. We were told \u2014 they ask you who you are \u2014 first of all, you don\u2019t speak no Russian, a word, even the people who speak Russians, they shouldn\u2019t say a word in Russian. So they told us we should say we are Greeks. We were displaced, thr-thrown out from Greece, and now we like to go back. The train stopped there by the \u2014 by the bridge there, where it\u2019s supposed to go over to the American zone, on the Russian zone, the train stopped there, and the Russkis came around. They were a little bit better dressed already, they didn\u2019t have that knife and fork and \u2014 and sticked in in their boots. They were a little cleaner, they come around this, and to every car they say, [speaks Russian] that \u2014 that much I learned. And nobody \u2014 everybody looked in them, and we kept on saying \u2014 a guy came over to me, he says to me [Russian]? No, Greco, Greco, Greco. So he kept on going, because that\u2019s what they told. But in that train with me, there was a lot of Russian \u2014 I know what they were looking, they were looking for deserters, mostly deserters. There was a russ \u2014 a lot of Russian Jewish soldier, they deserted and they went to Palestine. I would say most of the credit for the liberation, 1948, comes to those Russian soldier, they were already trained, and they really know how to fight, Interview with Bernard Pasternak * October 22, 1997 those people, that\u2019s why \u2014 I was talking with them after. So finally they \u2014 we went to that bridge and we went into Linz already in the American zone. It was the \u2014 it was something to us like in the liberation from the Nazis, because we really liberated now. We stood in Linz, they had camps there made up for displace persons. So I was talk with my sisters, my brother, I says to the \u2014 I says, you know, this is too close to the Russian. I \u2014 I \u2014 we hated them so much what they did to us. I said, let\u2019s go further and far away from them, far away. So we went into Salzburg \u2014 Salzburg, and they also had camp set up, a displaced person camp."

That\u2019s where we were \u2014 we are a\u2014 we are telling that Pasternak [indecipherable], he \u2014 he \u2014 he was born in 1927, and he lived in the \u2014 in Salzburg, the camp in Salzburg they called Machne Yehuda, estra(ph). He was the electrician in la \u2014 in the camp, and he did a lot of installation work, he made a lot of people very comfortable. People start to come that time, the people who got liberated from Russia \u2014 there wasn\u2019t only concentration \u2014 people from the concentration camp, there was already people they came from Russia. And I \u2014 I tried to do the best and \u2014 and of course there was no pay whatsoever for this, you did it just for the \u2014 for the sake of the people. And that\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a signed by the [indecipherable] and it\u2019s signed by the \u2014 by the whole \u2014 by the whole people in there who was in charge of that camp. But when I was in camp there, I did not really \u2014 I was not such a great electrician to be able to get a job any other place, you know. There, you put a wire right to left, and so you can be an \u2014 you could get by. But I was very interested in the \u2014 in that kind of job for my future, so I\u2014I went and I registered myself in \u2014 in I\u20141n the ORT school. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak * October 22, 1997 They had a ORT school, and I \u2014 I learned there \u2014 I went there electrician school, but I had a problem, yeah, I had a problem at the ORT school. One of the problem \u2014 most of them were speaking Polish, were mostly fr \u2014 they came from Russia. | didn\u2019t speak a word Polish, a few words, so I had a problem, but the problem got solved a little bit, I start picking up the Polish language, so it got a little bit better. I had certificate right in front of my eyes with a picture from the ORT in Salzburg. It says [indecipherable] student of electric, electrician in Salzburg, and this was given out to me in 1948. I also have one \u2014 another one that\u2019s \u2014 th-that [indecipherable] from the [RO \u2014 well, from the ORT, was in \u2014 in Haline(ph).

And this is the certifica \u2014 the certif \u2014 certify that Pasternak Beru \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know I used to call Bernard Beru, now I didn\u2019t even know this, they call me that Beru, b-e-r-u, born in 15/8/1927, in Oybarishu, Romania has been registered in Camp Reidenburg since August 1946 til August 1948.

            "answer": "Mostly Jewish. Mostly \u2014 mostly \u2014 most of them Jewish people. That camp was in Salzburg, in Reidenburg what they called the camp, that was mostly all Jewish people. It was, like I said, there was people from concentration camp, there was people who arrive from Russia, and destination was Israel, because we supposed to get that \u2014 you know, the \u2014 the country is supposed to be born that time. Before \u2014 before even the country was born, I had a little bit, you know, like something, a revenge type \u2014 I felt myself I need some kind of revenge to see what they did to the Jewish people, to the families, things like that. And the only thing what I could do to go in and to \u2014 to go to the Irgun, they had classes 1n \u2014 in the camp they had classes for the Irgun. So I became a Irgunist. I did a few things, you know, right or wrong, whatever it was, so to take some kind of revenge, to see \u2014 and I learned to shoot very good, and I became to \u2014 to be a very good soldier in there. It took months and months. Of course, it was hidden, 1t was underground whole \u2014 the whole thing. There was some already Israelis [indecipherable]. Matter of fact, most of them were Israelis who trained us how to shoot. And I never had a gun in my hand or thing like this. So they had, in Salzburg, they had big parks in there, in \u2014 like amusement parks. I went in the park one time with my friends, and you know, they had this \u2014 to shoot the ducks or the other thing, and I aimed perfect and everything, whatever I want to shoot, so I became \u2014 matter of fact, they even said, 1- Interview with Bernard Pasternak * October 22, 1997 if you go \u2014 when I go to Israel, is gonna be, I\u2019m gonna be the first sergeant without any st-st \u2014 star from the stripe, not from the beginning. They put me on for sergeant right away, the way I was leading, and the way I was operating and \u2014 and the way I was learning the whole thing. I wanted to go to Israel so bad because before the war, and I was a kid, I also belonged to organization Betar. I wanted to go to Israel that time, but I could not go at that time because the parents were ver \u2014 very against, and also the rabbis were very against, and even that time, of which the Romanians didn\u2019t care too much about the organization, we had to be underground 1n account of the Jew, our own Jewish people, because they said to me, if you step out of this city from here, you\u2019re gonna became a non-Jew. So I says, well, there 1s \u2014 my aunt is in the United States and she\u2019s Jewish, and maybe I could go there. No, you cannot go no place, otherwise you\u2019re not gonna be a Jew, you\u2019re gonna throw away your heritage, your Jewish heritage. And they \u2014 matter of fact, really I wanted to go to Israel because my \u2014 my \u2014 I \u2014 the Zionists were so much \u2014 even now, my Zionist was so much in me, I wanted to go just to Israel. I didn\u2019t care, I wanted to be [indecipherable] just to go, and I was young, 17 - 18 year. I could not go because those rabbi didn\u2019t let me. And I tell you the truth, I have a hatred for that, because they hold us back, all the kids. Most of the kids they even \u2014 they even got killed in the concentration camp. So when I was already ready to go to Israel, which I Interview with Bernard Pasternak *\u00b0 October 22, 1997 mentioned, I had an aunt, she lived in the Bronx, and \u2014 156 Honeywell Avenue, and was [indecipherable] Boulevard, so Southern Boulevard. So I went and we didn\u2019t know her address, but my older sister Rose, she remembered she used to write to \u2014 my mother used to write to her sister. She remembered the address by heart. So we wrote her, and she said, dear, we are so happy you are alive, and things like this. She said, don\u2019t try to go any other place, come to the United States first. I have \u2014 matter of fact, I have papers here in front of me. When my aunt send us all paper, you know, the affidavits with working, with all the guarantee. She says, first come here and then you gonna go to Israel, Israel just created right now, it\u2019s gonna be a little hardship. I says, I don\u2019t care the hardship, that\u2019s what I want to do. And finally I couldn\u2019t leave my sister, we \u2014 we have such a few left, so finally we decided we come to United States."

A lot of visas came in from almost all over the western world, that they take in so many people, so many people. And due to the fact my aunt, she wrote us we should come to the United States first, so of course you have to prepare yourself to come to the State to see, because like my aunt said, so few were left of her \u2014 of my sister\u2019s children, I would like very much you should come here first, but then you make your destination further. So we start preparing to do \u2014 come to the \u2014 the United States. There was a lot of visas you could go in any other country, like my brother-in-law went to South America. And I had friends, they went to Australia. They went all over the world, but my aim was now the United States. So from Austria they did not take people yet to go to the United States. So we heard in Italy this \u2014 it\u2019s a faster quota there, you could go faster from Italy to the States. So we went to Italy. We went some friends and we went to Italy. So, it Interview with Bernard Pasternak \"\u00b0 October 22, 1997 \u2014 it didn\u2019t go so smooth either. We had to \u2014 from Salzburg we had to go to Innsbruck. From Innsbruck \u2014 this is Austria, from Innsbruck in the area, to go over the border to Italy. So Italy was already independent, and they had the \u2014 watching the border there, and a \u2014 soldier were there and we were trying to go over the border, they caught us a few times. That\u2019s why I will never forget those Italian that time. They caught us twice, and due to the fact I speak Romanian, and it wasn\u2019t too much a \u2014 of a differential for the Italian, so I start talking to the guy, he ask me, where you go? I says, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m looking for a be \u2014 a better world. I\u2019m looking for the \u2014 to settle myself. He say, you want to settle Italy? I says, no, I have an aunt in the United States. He says, okay, but right now what we have to do with you guy, we have to send you back, because that\u2019s the rule. And next time we\u2019ll see. It just happened, the guards there, they saw what\u2019s coming, and they turn around the other way and they say, Avanti! Avanti! Avanti! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. So we went over the border, and we took a train, and we went into Meran, not Milano, Meran. This is then the northern part between Austria and Italy. So we went into that city over there. Of course, the Joint was there already. And from Meran they made arrangements, and we went to Milano. And also they had the camp there, only transit. Meran was a transit camp and Milano was a transit camp. So they, from there we sh \u2014 we went to a place not f-far from Meran, they called it Chiari after, Interview with Bernard Pasternak 7 October 22, 1997 Chiari. In that they had a camp already established to go to is \u2014 to Israel, to go to any other place, or to United States. It was a faster \u2014 you know, faster \u2014 you get visa much faster over there to go wherever you gonna go. So I was in that place in Chiari for a little while, and then I heard that if you go to Bari, it\u2019s much faster from Bari. So we went by train, it took all night. The train were going a little faster than in Romania, so we went all night, we went to Bari. Bari had a camp which it was the \u2014 you could have stayed there and there\u2019s camps there, but there was another place not far from Bari, they called it Trani. And we went to that camp, it also was about five hours or so with the train, approximately. So we went into Trani over there, and we stood there for a little while, a f\u2014 months already. The whole thing took a year and a half or something like this, wh-what I\u2019m telling you, between Austria and Italy all those things. So when it came, there was a delegation over there, and they start taking all the refugee people to go to the United States. Now, it wasn\u2019t so easy to come to United States. First of all, you had to go through from he \u2014 head to tail, they \u2014 they checked you out. Well, they checked out you in general, and they find out \u2014 and they wanted to know if you have anybody sponsoring you. And wanted to know if you have a trade and the feeling, and all those things. And how intelligent you are, they showed something to look. And in books, something to figure out numbers like they do it for children now, they put it Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u201d October 22, 1997 one, two, thr-three together. I did put them \u2014 I could put them all together because the colors were so funny, I could put them together. So the bottom line, everything was set, and it \u2014 did they come that we are ready to go to the United States. So from there, from Bari we went to Naples. We stood there for a little while, I think they had some kind of a strike that time, so we hanged out to Naples. And \u2014 and then finally we had a boat, we had [indecipherable] a boat \u2014 matter of fact, they just brought some soldiers over to Italy and the boat was empty to go back, and the boat\u2019s name was General Greely. So we went in in the boat in there, and of course, after being so hungry all those years, I was watching to eat because I shouldn\u2019t get sick again. But I\u2014 I was always hungry. Matter of fact, I\u2019m even hungry now. I mean, I cannot full myself up from those bad days. So I went to the boat, we went in there and right away I volunteer to work. Because wherever I went in Italy, I worked. I made some money in the \u2014 all those places where I stood, I always look for a\u2014 sometimes I worked in the camp, they paid, because the Italian government paid for that. So I had some money and tell you, the first time I saw what life is when I was in Italy. First of all, the people were so nice. It\u2019s a different type of people over there, and so friendly and generous. And I had money, and I never know how to live, and this \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 tell you, this I \u2014 I know this 1s the best life what I ever had up til now, because all the \u2014 matter of fact, we went into \u2014 the Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u201d October 22, 1997 government was so nice in general to us. We went in, when we were in Milano, and there was a theater playing that time in this [indecipherable] Milano. I went in there and th-there was no room whatsoever, but due to the fact we told them we are \u2014 we are fr \u2014 refugees, so \u2014 which I speak the language already. We are refugees, so right away they made us at home and they took us in there to see the opera. And I was not much interested in opera thing, so I walked right out the other way, you know, they shouldn\u2019t see me, they made so much effort to get me in. So I walked out. And there was other places which I was interested and they gave us so much respect for the \u2014 because we were refugee, profugo they called it, we are refugees. Matter of fact, a lot of time you could have go from one place to the other over the train free because they know you are a refugee, and what you went through. So finally we go in the boat, General Greely. I said \u2014 they ask volunteers, I went to work in the kitchen, where the food is. So I went to work in there in the kitchen, and I was doing \u2014 in Italy I traveled around from one place to the other one. I went to a lot of place; I went to Pompeii, I went to other places. I went to see, you know, all the old places, and I went to Assisi. Well, ha \u2014 you name it, I went all over Italy to see, because I had an opportunity to travel. So I worked in the kitchen in the boat, I worked in the kitchen. And the third day I got so sick, I got so sick with all the food. Matter of fact, it\u2019s not only me, the whole boat got sick. Everybody got sick Interview with Bernard Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 [indecipherable] throw all the food around there. It was something. But I have some friends, they live now in Queens on \u2014 in New York. And just a couple of guys, they were standing there and they were laughing [indecipherable] and then nothing affected them whatsoever. So it took a few days pass the island of Capri, and the boat to come in. And a few days after we come to ourselves you know, and we start acting a little bit normal. But the boat, it was some kind of a storm, and you could see the boat, you know, th-the plates in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the mess hall where people were eating, you see, while they were eating, the soup was going one place to the other one, it was going back and forth with the boat and rockling the boat. And finally we come to our desti \u2014 destination. We c \u2014 we came to New York. Now"

            "answer": "Well, I had \u2014I figured I have a trade, which it didn\u2019t do much good in this country because they were doing different, but I had a start. And th-the whole thing was in my head just to settle down and \u2014 and to start living like a human being, not to travel around all over. So when I arrived in the \u2014 1n the country, they \u2014 we came straight in the harbor in New York City. I could never find out where the boat landed, it was in December 1949. I could never find out which harbor it come in. I Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22, 1997 wanted to go see the \u2014 really the place. Soon I walked down, there was a lot of organization, there was Christian organization, other organization waiting for their refugees, because in the boat was not only Jewish people, because there was refugees from \u2014 almost from all the Eastern Bloc. Some refugees were fr \u2014 they were Russians, from Russia they came. They were Polish, but they were in Russia. Some refugees [indecipherable] they run away from the Germans, and some of them they run away from the Russian. I don\u2019t know what kind of a people, what their background was, what their pol \u2014 politic was, I don\u2019t know. They were screened in \u2014 in Italy before they came, I don\u2019t know. So they \u2014 those organizations right away we had \u2014 like I had something written HIAS in my shirt, some people had different organization. So we had to go to the \u2014 each group. Matter of fact, I walked over to a Christian organization, I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s all about, and then \u2014 and the \u2014 the woman was so nice, he says, no, he says, the Jude organization is right across on the other side on the hall. So when I came over, the HIAS on Lafayette Street in New York City had already established for refugees who came over from the other side. They had room and board and they were looking for jobs for them, they took us downtown to the \u2014 in another place, to the Joint. I forgot the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the street over there, where they took us in there, and \u2014 and what the interview was for jobs, what we know. So that time, when I came from Italy, my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak ~ October 22, 1997 sisters were here already. They ca \u2014 they \u2014 they came from Austria because they were single and it was easier to get them out. So my sister and my brother came already. And they waited me \u2014 they waited for me six months before they came, they waited for me. First of all, I could have come really before. I didn\u2019t want to leave Italy. I had such a good life over there, why leave such a good life? Why go away? But my friends told me, this life is good, but United States even is a better life. I say, what do you mean? So they says to me, did you see the Marshall plan, an-and all over Austria and Germany and Italy? I say yes. He says, you see, all the star \u2014 things comes from the United States. Could you imagine if you go to the source where you got all those things? And there how good it could we? So I let myself talk in, I say you are right and we came over. And when we were \u2014 they were \u2014 the arrangement from the organization, they made arrangement we should go to Lafayette Street. But my sisters \u2014 sisters and my brother told me, he says, it\u2019s not so cozy with my aunt, the way she wrote we should go. First thing my aunt did, she looked all over our packages, she figured we have a lot of money in there, we brought over from Europe. So it was a different aim and so soon they saw me, they say, you not going to my aunt, he says, you go to the HIAS in there, and \u2014 and be established from over there, whatever you have to do. You want to go from there. So I find they already give me all the information there, so I went to the HIAS. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak ~ October 22, 1997 Now they took taxis, they had taxis to take from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the thing \u2014 from the boat there, from the terminal there. They had taxis to take you to the HIAS. I walked on the street, and I \u2014 with my head down, I looked down. So the guys asked me in Yiddish, he says to me, what are you looking for? Wassusto(ph). I said well, I was told there\u2019s a lot of money in the streets in the United States, I thought maybe I could pick some \u2014 maybe I could pick up some. The guy says to me in Yiddish [speaks Yiddish]. Til you gonna see a dollar, you\u2019ve \u2014 you\u2019re gonna get black and blue til you gonna find a dollar here. You gotta work your head off. I says to my friend, see why we came? You gonna work your head off, you had such a good life in Italy. So he says to me, one guy which you get a \u2014 still in contact \u2014 we still have a few friends we are in contact from the camps. They are spread all over. So, I says to him, okay, let\u2019s see the bottom line what\u2019s gonna happen. So we \u2014 I always wanted to go back to Italy. Whatever I did, I wasn\u2019t happy, I just wanted to go to Italy, I want to go to Italy. So once got together with my sister and my bro \u2014 my brother. He sits down there, he says to me, look, we know you had a good life in Italy, better than we had in Austria, because it\u2019s a different country, different [indecipherable] with better things in there. But I want to tell you something, my brother says to me, when you came with the boat, did you see the Statue of Liberty? I say, what\u2019s the Statue of Liberty? Did you see somebody like a woman holding Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak ~ October 22, 1997 one hand up and one hand down, with a book\u2019? I say yeah. He says, you know what that means by us refugee? The hand up means welcome to United States. The hand down means, you never gonna leave the United States. Here you gonna be buried and die in the United States, you never gonna leave that. So we all start laughing and that\u2019s what it happened, exactly what happened, you just go [indecipherable] think like this, so you\u2019ll always come back to the United States. So we were in the HIAS a week or so, and then they took us to a \u2014 to the Joint in there to start interviewing us. What kind of \u2014 they had a big \u2014 big building over there, just \u2014 I just forgot the place. And there was a lot of people, they interview you in your own language, [indecipherable] what job you could know, what job you could do. And I told them what I could do, and \u2014 but in the meantime til they find something, I \u2014 my aunt had a cousin here, and he was a tinsmith. So in the meantime, I \u2014 I \u2014 of \u2014 I just \u2014I\u2014I was without work maybe \u2014 maybe, maybe two months. So he says to me, look, a temporary thing til you get the real job, you come work for me. I have work for a\u2014 once in a while I have a little work. I do roofing, I do other thing, repairing. So I says, okay. So got a few dollars that time, for \u2014 so I went to work for him, he was someplace in \u2014 in Brooklyn, and you had \u2014 go travel from New York to Brooklyn, if you don\u2019t know you \u2014 you know, you don\u2019t know your way, you don\u2019t know the language. So I supposed to start eight o\u2019clock, I used to leave 5:30 in the Interview with Bernard Pasternak * October 22, 1997 morning because I left a few hours for going from one place to the other one, one train \u2014 I traveled all over the city before I re \u2014 I reached the destination. I think it was in Grammerton(ph) Avenue in Brooklyn, he had a job, til I got used, better and better. And my uncle wanted to show off that he\u2019s a real American when I used to go downtown from him from \u2014 fr \u2014 when I used to go with him, travel around from one place to the other one. So he bought a newspaper, he looks in the newspaper \u2014 I don\u2019t even think he knew how to read that time because the newspaper wasn\u2019t even straight. So he takes the paper, looks in it, he comes to the station the next day, he throws it in the garbage. He says, you see, that\u2019s what you do in United States. You look in the newspaper, you have no time to, you throw it away. I don\u2019t even think he knows anything in that thing because he couldn\u2019t read at all. Why he wanted to make an impression to me, that he \u2014 and then I went out after, I went out with my cousins and they took me around, they took me to ice cream parlor. And I go in there and get an ice cream. She says, you know what you with that? You lick it. I said, no kidding, I said, I didn\u2019t know you lick ice cream. I says, you think I come from the mountains, I didn\u2019t have ice cream in Italy, or in any other place? So \u2014 but I didn\u2019t want [indecipherable] so I\u2019m glad you told me, at least you teach me something, you know, weth \u2014 important thing. So finally I got \u2014 I went back for the interview and for the job, and they still couldn\u2019t find the right Interview with Bernard Pasternak *\u00b0 October 22, 1997 job for me. I find some people who we came over with the boat together, I ask them, where you working? So they told me, I\u2019m working there and there in a metal factory, but it\u2019s so dirty over there, we couldn\u2019t take the dirt. So he says, but I\u2019m sure with your background, I think you could get a job over there and you could work in there, provided you like the grease and the dirt. So I went in the place for an interview, and the guy was talking to me in English, what the heck, I know English, I know a few word, okay, okay [indecipherable]. So he says to me, first I want you to go try my friend, he has a place over there and see if he could get you a job. So I went over to the guy over there someplace in Manhattan. I went in there, I see people working, cutting wood and other thing, just \u2014 just a regular work. Went in there, he start talking to me, I didn\u2019t understand not one word he was saying. I had to work harder, I say okay, okay, I don\u2019t understand a word. I mean, to give me the courtesy, I speak so many languages, can\u2019t you talk to me in a different type of language? So was sticking to the English. So then I went back to the \u2014 to the place where the guy told me he is working. I went in there and comes out \u2014 the guy comes out first, interviews me and then the boss comes out and checks out the interview, see \u2014 he looks at me, he says, you know, I see something in you. I\u2019m gonna give you a job. And I\u2019m gonna try you out, see what you could do. So I went in in that factory over there, machinery, dust flying all over, because that time they didn\u2019t Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u201d October 22, 1997 care too much about the pollution, all those thing. And I went in there and I would take anything, because if you have no language, I mean you don\u2019t know the language, you have to take what you can. So I went in there and start working."

And also some of the people and \u2014 and \u2014 in \u2014 in the job, they were afraid that something is wrong with me because I went to a camp, or maybe I did some kind of a criminal activities I did, why di \u2014 they put me in a camp, because they couldn\u2019t understand why I was, you know, in prison for something like this. So it was very hard to explain, which I could not explain, but after they saw pictures, and they saw the newspapers, so they start to get a little bit educated more, a-and start to accept me. But I should say, the worst \u2014 somebody to call me Jew, or thing like this, yes I do have encounter with the people who were working. I \u2014 I understand already a little bit, and I remember one guy used to call me hey Jew- boy, come over here, hey, Jew-boy. I figured that\u2019s the way you call somebody Interview with Bernard Pasternak October 22, 1997 over, til somebody else told me what it means.

So she picked up the phone and she asked me, 1s true you are going to the army? I says yeah, I just said, I\u2019m supposed to go to the army, I am waiting. And then the meantime I \u2014 give me a lot of courage, because she called, and I said, would you like to go out for a date? She says, okay, before you go to the Korean War, I go out with you. So I went out with her once, I went out with her twice, and it came through that 4-F. She was Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u201c October 22, 1997 going with somebody, if she cared, she didn\u2019t care too much. The cousin where she was living, so she says, gee I\u2019m torn \u2014 my wife says, I\u2019m torn between two things, she says. I got this guy, and I got this guy. I says, what do I do? So the uncle, or the cousin, he says to her, look, I don\u2019t know much about the other guy, but I could tell you this; Bernie comes from Mamurish(ph) and I know all those people, they work very hard, and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t go hungry. And it looks like he did the trick and finally we go out again. And we went in Mount Vernon in the \u2014 and parked there in the park there, we sat down over there and I ask her, I says, look, would you try to get more serious and thing? So we went \u2014 went around for a while. A serious thing, they called it steady that time. But my family wasn\u2019t too keen about her, because my wife has a \u2014 she talks a little loud, but she means nothing, but that\u2019s the way she talks and they couldn\u2019t accept her to \u2014 right away. But I saw in her a different thing. I saw in her a smart, and knows what she\u2019s doing. And I saw in her that we could have a nice future together, because I am not a businessman. I would be very well off if I were to be a businessman. I\u2019m not a businessman type and she is. So she had \u2014 she was always a step ahead of me, whatever I wanted to do. So then, when I was talking to my family, I says look, I says look, this girl who I\u2019m gonna marry, she has more than \u2014 than you think with \u2014 with all the things she says, we \u2014 So they said look, it\u2019s your life and your decision, things like this.

And then they says, if you think so \u2014 so highly about her, we\u2019ll accept your \u2014 your knowhow, your thinking. And let\u2019s see, let\u2019s plan and see what\u2019s gonna work out. And we had our cousin, he was in the jewel business, and we\u2019re talking to him for a ring. This cousin \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to buy a ring and she shou-shouldn\u2019t like it. By the way, I already had 1500 dollars saved, which I was in the country two years, and that\u2019s a heck of a lot of money because I work so much overtime. And I wanted her to encourage that \u2014 like the cousin said, that she not gonna go hungry, so I wanted to encourage her, and I was working that time seven days a week and 10 - 11 hours a day. I had a check of 250 dollar. I was working 70 cents an hour. So when we went to take out the marriage license that time, I had loose change, I says to her, I says, look, Bella, I don\u2019t have any change you could see, but I have my check, you cash it tomorrow, and you pay for the license, two dollar, which I tease her up \u2014 up to today I say, you paid for me.

And as saw the check, she was [indecipherable] right away, she says, gee, this guy makes a lot of money. Because people used to make 60, 70 dollar a week that time, and I had 250 dollar, single guy. So I don\u2019t know if Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u00b0\u00b0 October 22, 1997 that impressed her to marry me, because she \u2014 she didn\u2019t care for money, never cared for money in general. So \u2014 but it \u2014 it helped, I wouldn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t help. And she \u2014 they took the check and cashed it, you know, and \u2014 and I says, you open a bank \u2014 we \u2014 we were only talking about getting engaged. And she had the cousin that he was in the jewelry business, and I had 1500 dollar, and then she picked out the ring of 1200 dollar. So it\u2019s \u2014 were a little over a carat, a carat and a quarter, something like that. She picked out that ring, so I paid the 1200 dollar for the ring."

So we decided we gonna have to change school for him, to make it a little bit closer to Yeshiva University. This way you pick him up, you pick them up all one time. So there was a school, the [indecipherable] School. So we registered him over there, in [indecipherable] and he finished his two year there. He was so Interview with Bernard Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 advanced from Westchester Day School that he always was ahead of the game in school. Til \u2014 in there, there was no transportation at all, so we didn\u2019t have a bus like in Westchester Day School. So what happened in the morning? My wife, before she went to the real estate business, she took them to school every day by day for years and years and I picked him up at night, six, seven o\u2019clock, day by day, all the time. This is the way they got their transportation back and forth. That\u2019s not all, sometime they had games, they had other thing, and I didn\u2019t want him to \u2014 you know, to hold them back from anything, so we took them back at night, sometimes I fall asleep in the car waiting til they get out from the game, and this went on til they all finished, and they all finished Yeshiva University school."

            "question": "During this time, tell me, how was your \u2014 your business, your \u2014 your job world developing?",
            "answer": "Well, I start working in this metal plant, and I was doing very hard work, you know, like \u2014 like a plain labor or things like this. And this boss who hired me, after he says he sees something in me, after a year or so, I was performing very good. Usually in that plant what they did is, if you were working a whole \u2014 a whole year without being out for any good reason, you used to get an award. I always got the award because I was never out. And my record was so great. So I didn\u2019t even know this, this guy was an expert in \u2014 they both was an expert in metal. And he \u2014 one Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u00ae October 22, 1997 time he was watching me, I didn\u2019t even see him watching me. I was working piecework at that time, you really had to move. So he was watching me, and he came over here, he came \u2014 I was speaking English already, with a Yiddish en \u2014 accent. So he came over to me, he says, hey listen. I don\u2019t have a section head over here, would you like to take over the section? Maybe 30 people in there. Me? Me? I don\u2019t even speak the language the right way. How you want me to do something like that? I don\u2019t even write, I can\u2019t even spell. He says, we\u2019ll give you a secretary, we'll give you anything you want, just take over the area. He had 30 people in there, I saw a lot of faults in that department, but I only mind my own business, I did what I have to do. But once I was in charge, I shifted 10 people on the spot. I says, I don\u2019t need these 10 people because this guy could do two jobs. Not to do something which is impossible, because what happened there, they put a line on, and when the one guy finished faster, he was standing around and doing nothing. I says, Okay, you finish this and then you take the other area. And things like this, I shifted 10 \u2014 about 10 people approximately. And then they saw I was doing so good with this \u2014 with thing, they had a meeting, the bosses had a meeting between them. They said, let\u2019s make him a supervisor. Came around again with the same bosses, with the same stories and I told them with the same stories, but I wasn\u2019t so much afraid for the \u2014 for being the supervisor because I had the section head already Interview with Bernard Pasternak \u201d October 22, 1997 taking. I took over the job of supervisor on the \u2014 fine, of course, you get a hundred people involved. And I was running back and forth and try to run the department. And I was so success 1n running the department, that we need more machinery. Okay, we need more machinery. I get machinery, so there\u2019s a lot of places where you buy those machinery, those kind of things. Called me in, he says, you going to Detroit to buy a machine for this. I say, where\u2019s Detroit? What Detroit? So he explained me, and he says, like I was telling you, we get you all the help. You could take somebody with you if you want to, and you going to Detroit to buy the machine. I went to Detroit, come back \u2014 that time, in the 50s, we paid almost a half a million dollars for a machine, and I was trusted with so much money to buy the machine. And put out the machine, I set up the machine, put \u2014 course, I had to learn the business, I had to stay in Detroit for a week, two weeks, to learn the bi \u2014 to learn the machine, the new type of machines. Put down the machine and business started booming again, started hiring more people and kept on going all over the country, I went all over the cun \u2014 Minneapolis, I went all over the country to get machines. Matter of fact, there was another guy, a boss, he was of German descent, and that guy used to travel around too. He went to Germany, he bought a machine. He says to me, Bernie, you going to Frankfurt? I says no, I\u2019m not going there. I said, I don\u2019t want to put my foot down there, I\u2019m not going there. He says okay, this Interview with Bernard Pasternak ia October 22, 1997 is part of the business. It\u2019s something you have to do, and if you won\u2019t do it, then we gonna have a problem. So he says, take somebody with you. I took somebody with me, I went to \u2014 to Frankfurt, I went to other places around there to buy the machine, went back to the old places. And when I stepped down in the airport, Frankfurt am Main, I saw Nazis over there, you know, I see the \u2014 the picture comes back to me. It was so \u2014 you know, in early 60s, it was something, you know, it come back to my mind. So I says to the guy, he was an Italian guy, I says to him, I say, listen. I don\u2019t want to touch a fra \u2014 a\u2014a mark, I don\u2019t want to touch anything here. I\u2019m gonna buy something in the store which 1s made in any other country, and you handle the whole thing. I do the negotiation, and you handle the whole thing. So he couldn\u2019t handle it the right way, so I have to step in anyhow, because it would be a problem. So after the meeting was there, and we bought the machines, that\u2019s already came out for over a million dollar machines, came out the machines, so finally they said stick \u2014 there was a Belgian guy at one who lived in Germany, so he says, okay, we going out to eat in Frankfurt. I says, okay, we going out to eat, but I want to tell you something. I only eat kosher. They all got stung because I \u2014 they didn\u2019t even know I was Jewish. So the other guy says, I don\u2019t even know where they have kosher places in here. So they told the secretary, she kept on looking and looking, looking. Finally they find in the synagogue in Frankfurt, Interview with Bernard Pasternak \" October 22, 1997 there was a Hungarian family that immigrated there, Jewish Hungarian. Matter of fact, she was from Hungary, he was from Israel. They opened a kosher place in there. So they say, oh, we have a kosher place in there. So we were re \u2014 all went in there and eat. Can you imagine that? Making all those Nazis eat kosher food? And when we went in there I said, that\u2019s not enough, I want to do something else too. I say, you want wine? I say yes. Which I don\u2019t drink wine, once in a while. Well, actually [indecipherable] So, I says okay. So they bring out the best wine from France. | said no, no, no, no, no. I want wine from Israel, and I want to see the kosher mark on there. So they brought kosher wine and I had to make all of Nazis drink kosher wine too, so I should get a little bit revenge of them. So we find out the deal, we made up the deal, everything. Went back a few times there because \u2014 and I went the same thing, the same thing what I said now, I never saw a mark and I never touched a mark. And never bought anything except when I bought in the stores, I went in \u2014 I went in with the American dollar to buy, that time. And then came home, we put up all those machines. And from the hundred people, g-grown to 250 people. The business was so booming, the whole plant had over a thousand people. Business was so booming that we had to put in a night shift. So I was in charge in day and night on the plant and the machine. Matter of fact, I got up, I went as high as I became a metallurgent(ph) engineer. I know metal, I know it Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak ia October 22, 1997 anyhow, so I didn\u2019t go to school, but I recognize the metal anyhow, and I told them if it\u2019s stainless steel, if it\u2019s 1ron, how much iron is in there. So I became the metallurgents(ph) engineer, and we hired people, new people. We hired a lot of Italian people because I speak the language and they were very good workers, so I was leaning to the Italian people. And also I never forget what they did for me when they told me Avanti, Avanti. So I never forget, which I have a soft spot for them. I went back a few times to Italy and I have neighbors Italian, I speak to them Italian. But there was one time I couldn\u2019t get any workers. They used to ask me, where you get those people? Do you go to the boat? Do you pick them up there? And so I couldn\u2019t get any people, so they were \u2014 that time \u2014 Puerto Rico opened that time, and there\u2019s a lot of Puerto Ricans came in. And interviewed them, and of course they didn\u2019t speak a word Engli\u2014 interview them. And before they start speaking English, I learned Spanish, because they couldn\u2019t speak the language, so I had to learn Spanish in \u2014 in the job there. So I was \u2014 I had about \u2014 about 250 people, maybe more, in charge day and night of the oldest machinery. And I find I\u2019m working over there 37 year in one place. I was that time in the union, and when they make me all those big \u2014 big \u2014 make me all those proposal, they says, you have to step out of the union, because you cannot be in the union and you cannot be a boss in the side. I came home and I told my wife, I said this and this happen, I could Interview with Bernard Pasternak ia October 22, 1997 became the vice-president in charge of manufacturing, if \u2014 but I cannot be in the union. She says to me, look, you stay where you are. You \u2014 I don\u2019t need a title. You\u2019re doing very good the way it 1s, don\u2019t leave the union. There was a lot of guys that left the union, and it\u2019s true, they \u2014 they lost their jobs. And I was protected from the union. So I was staying in the union. They \u2014 they had no choice, and I didn\u2019t want to leave, so they left me the way it was, and the exemp \u2014 exemption to do something like this, to work for the boss, and to work for the union. Then is \u2014 the plant got bigger and bigger and I retired, and they take over the \u2014 some other people took over the plant, and the plant went downhill, it took about 10 years. I\u2019m retired already 10 years, and they took over the plant and they \u2014 they \u2014 they brought it down and down and down. Finally they sold it, and \u2014 and they moved to Thailand, the whole company moved to Thailand. So they dissolved the pi \u2014 dissolved everything over here. People were coming to me. I had some of the former bosses, they begged me to go and restructure the whole thing, I mean, but I was not interested to go back. I was, but my wife did not want me to go back. She says, enough is enough, so that\u2019s it."

Also was looking for the right girl, which everybody looks for the right man or the right girl, which I could say I find it. We both fit in so much to each other like a pot with a cover. I was very honest all those years, I\u2019m married for so many years. I had my fun in Italy, so I was very, very devoted to the family, and very honest with my wife, on \u2014 pulling on the same track together, we never stepped out of line. Once you step out of line, you lose everything. So we educated \u2014 highly educated our kids. We worked really, really the hardest way we could, we worked seven days a week, that she worked.

We did when they went to the schooling, and we had also, the most important thing was the friends, with which friend you were going. Sometimes they Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Bernard Pasternak = October 22, 1997 went out with friends and we didn\u2019t like their friends, because their friends, they left the kids with babysitters, 1t didn\u2019t work out. So we didn\u2019t agree with that, and the kids, after they finished the Yeshiva University, they decided they want to go to get the profession, so decided he want to go to law.

But I want to tell you something, you gonna be a lawyer, I don\u2019t want a shysie(ph) lawyer in my family, I want the best lawyer there is. If you cannot perform as the best lawyer, I don\u2019t want a lawyer. But thank God he made it, and my wife got her wish, he\u2019s the best lawyer. So my second boy, he came around, I ask him, what you want to do with your life, what you want to do for the future? So he says, I\u2019m gonna be a \u2014 a manager, some kind, industrial managing, things like that. I says to him, look, there are so many thing \u2014 so many people doing that kind of job, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna be some kind of a future. But if you want it, I'll [indecipherable]. So then I find out he is interested to go in law. So he went into law too. And of course my third one followed the same step. What I could tell you one thing, that Iam very happy with their profession, and they\u2019re very established in the \u2014 in their way. By my \u2014 by Jerry I have two grandchildren, and they\u2019re wonderful children. And my younger boy, he \u2014 he live \u2014 Jerry lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.

He has a \u2014 Jerry has a boy and a girl, and my younger boy Steven, he has two girls. One girl 1s named after my mother and my sister, the one I was telling you she died in the camp, Hannah(ph) Esther. My other granddaughter is named through my wife family. And I wanted to have a name for my father so bad, so my younger son, he gave me the whole name, and I called him Moishe Zev. He doesn\u2019t even have an English name, just Moishie(ph). That\u2019s the way they call him. He\u2019s also very \u2014 he succeeds very much in his [indecipherable] in his \u2014 my younger one, he opened his own practice and [indecipherable] in a law firm. And my middle boy, we \u2014 he just got married in November. He was waiting too long, he couldn\u2019t find what he wants to here.

They are very well established themself, and thank God, they don\u2019t need any help from nobody, because they\u2019re doing in their own. And I could say that I made it, what my aim was, my dream, everything came true the way. Of course, like I said, if you married, and you start pulling different direction, you never make it. Once you stay together and you work out your problems together, you make it. I give you an example for myself."
