In the middle of the night the \u0152 they brought big truck, military truck came up \u0152 came in, pulled me out of the bed, put hand on my mouth a nd said, don\u2122t talk, be quiet . And they took me and put me in that truck, and they told me we going to Palestine. But meanwhile, I don\u2122t \u0152 I don\u2122t remember if they took other kids or not with them. It \u0152 I\u2122m not really remember very well. But they took me and they \u0152 we went to different places, I do not know where, what. From one place to another place, again traveled through Interview with Esther Fol November 8, 2008 12Europe again, illegally, just like I did with my mother when my mother escaped from the ghetto and went and traveled, and somehow went back to the city, I think to her husband. That\u2122s why she returned back, because she couldn\u2122t \u0152 nobody help her there and she couldn\u2122t do nothing. So she had to retu rn back. But she \u0152 I was in Belgium before, and France and other countries, and somehow we return back to Poland. I mean, that\u2122s when my mother was still alive. This time I was moving from one country to another country. And the paper, according to the paper, they put me on the ship Sylvania (ph), and they \u0152 we \u0152 to Palestine. In the boat, I had a friend, the name Natala(ph), and she is in Israel today. And she was in my children home too, because I visited Israel in 2004, and we see that we [indecipherable] together, Natala (ph) and me. And on the boat, I do not know \u0152 the British caught us on the boat when we were close to Palestine \u0152 everybody was so happy \u0152 the British caught us and arrested us and put us in a prison. So, I think I was about six year old at that time, I became a prisoner of United Kingdom . And I don\u2122t know how long we were, but in a prison for long time. I was freezing, was not much \u0152 I remember they put fences there, and we were sleeping in a tent in Israel because there was not enough space, and \u0152 and it was very cold and freezing, and not enough food over there to \u0152 and, by the way, on the boat to \u0152 to Israel was not enough food to eat also, and every day we ate only fish. And I hated fish so much Interview with Esther Fol November 8, 2008 13because all \u0152 every meal was only fish, too, there was no other food to eat, any more left. And that was very tough, and that boat was also \u0152 people were, I think, Turkish, Arabs, Turkish were on that boat, too. And they wear the red hat that Turkish wear, and I think they were Turkish, and I used to be afraid of them so much. And somebody was saying on the boat th at they stealing the kids, too. So I always frightened from them. Anyway, on the way back in \u0152 back to \u0152 I mean Palestine, and then Israel was declared as a state, I was taken out of the prison and later on they send me to a foster family in Israel. And the name of the family, Goldschmidt [indecipherable] DDR [indecipherable] near Netanya. And I had foster family, and that was \u0152 life was not easy beginning because I had \u0152 I had to get used to new \u0152 to a family life, which I never had family before. And a home I had never had before. And they were very tough, they were Germans from Germany. And \u0152 Jewish Germans, and they were very, very tough disciplinary people, and they discipline me with the \u0152 a lot of hitting. I got again a lot of hitting. And I did, again, pee-pee in the bed. And th ey hit me for that also. And so the wa \u0152 life wasn\u2122t easy. But then first grade I didn\u2122t do good because in the school, first grade, I used all the time to dream about the fox who eated the kids, except me not. So I couldn\u2122t concentrate in the class, and I was \u0152 I didn\u2122t do good in school. So they decided I\u2122m going to be left over, and take the class first grade again. So the Interview with Esther Fol November 8, 2008 14foster family said no, she cannot. I\u2122m going to sit with her during the summer, and don\u2122t leave her, because she has friends there now, and she used to them. And this will be a crime for her to \u0152 to move to new fr \u0152 kids, and again the same class. So my foster mother sat with me every day, teach me ma th and teach me to read and write, and believe me on that , by the end of the summer I took a test for the first grade, I passed it.

My uncle in \u0152 Isaac Makowski (ph), who lives in \u0152 who at that time lived in Brooklyn , New York, in United States, he was not happy with th e family that I was living, because they were not religious Jewish. They were nice people, Jewish, but they were not Orthodox like he was. He was Hassidic Orthodox Jew. So he contacted [indecipherable] my uncle, my other uncle, and \u0152 and he ask him to sign that my parents were Orthodox, and they wanted me to be Orthodox. So my case became in a court, in Israeli court, and it took long time in Israeli court, and finally the Israeli court decided that I have to be removed for religious reason from \u0152 from Goldschmidt, from my foster family. So, after living in the house four and a half years, I was ordered by the court to remove, if not the ca \u0152 the fa-family would be arrested. So the family had to give me up, and they put me in a \u0152 in a Orthodox boarding school in Israel, and that was in a \u0152 and I\u2122m thinking a la \u0152 not Ramat Gan, that\u2122s was in Benai Brak , very religious place, and they send me to a religious school there, public school, a religious public school there, and to learn the religion. Well, my uncle aimed to bring me to United States, that was in 1953. And I refused to come to United States at the time because I hated him for doing what he did. So that came another family, and th ey told me that my uncle died, and they wanted to bring me to their house, to give me a home. I do not know who they Interview with Esther Fol November 8, 2008 17were. And that family had twins. Babies, two ba \u0152 twins, and I do not know. I found out later on that \u0152 that my uncle just send me a letter, that couldn't be that he died. So, it didn\u2122t work out. But then [indecipherable] so it didn\u2122t work out that way. And then I moved to Ramat Gan , that\u2122s another religious boarding school Ra\u2122anana . Ra\u2122anana in Ra\u2122anana \u0152 Ra\u2122anana , I\u2122m sorry, in Kfar Batya, Ra\u2122anana . That\u2122s a boarding school that I lived there, a elementary school, I was there a few years until 19 \u0152 until my first year \u0152 I finished there my first year high school, and then I asked to be mo ved to kibbutz. I went to Kibbutz Yavne, that\u2122s a religious school, high school, my second year high school in Israel, and I wasn\u2122t happy there. I didn\u2122t like the place. So \u0152 ki bbutz life, whatever it was. So I took a test and I got into a school, for lab technician school. That\u2122s a high school combination with a profession with a lab. So we had four year \u0152 four hours a day, five days a week laboratory, and the rest is a \u0152 mainly was concentrate on chemistry. That\u2122s how I started my [indecipherable] learning chemistry. Well, it started in high school. I was very good in math and sciences. And that\u2122s due to my foster family, maybe, they taught me the \u0152 when my foster mother was sitting with me every day to teach me, when I was living in their house, and that\u2122s how I got good in all these areas. I now focus a lot on school now, no more \u0152 I didn\u2122t have nothing else to focus on, so it was school. I was a very good stud ent, and I lived one Interview with Esther Fol November 8, 2008 18year in \u0152 in the Kibbutz Yavne. And then I went to Ramat Gan , to another family, a family that was also Holocaust survivor from Hungary , I forgot the names. And they had the number on their hand.

I got this information from my uncle, Isaac Makowski (ph) that there was a woman that saved my life, but they didn't know who \u0152 what\u2122s her name was.

I look at her like somebody important to me, that was important because she did visit at me, not every day, was too dangerous during the war, while it was in a children home there, in Slonim . But, very occasionally. It was too dangerous to come, otherwise, they will be suspicious that she knows me."
