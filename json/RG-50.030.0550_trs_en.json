We\u2019|l come talk to him, and see if he related to her. A \u2014 after \u2014 within short time, Dr. Pajewski(ph) come with a Jeep to the village, and they \u2014 he wanted to see Sonja Pajewski(ph), which is me. And he came and found out that we are family members. And then he contacted my uncle in Italy, the brother of my father was station \u2014 was in Italy at the time. And I think it was 1950. And \u2014 1950, and then I got a letter from Italy \u2014 they got a letter from Italy, and that was written in Italian. And, that he, my uncle, and he\u2019s happy that I\u2019m alive, and all that. And then sunny \u2014 one day came somebody from United States, a man, that he say he my uncle \u2014 he \u2014 I have an uncle here, and he is \u2014 his name 1s Isaac Makowski(ph), a brother of my mother, and he want to meet me. And he came to see how I am, and to meet me finally. Not my uncle, but he send somebody else to meet me there. And tha \u2014 to \u2014 to see I\u2019m alive, he found out that I\u2019m alive. That\u2019s happen after the accident with the \u2014 that \u2014 th-the Dr. Pajewski(ph). So, they Interview with Esther Fol \u00b0 November 8, 2008 discover I have family members. Now became another problem. My uncle in \u2014 Isaac Makowski(ph), who lives in \u2014 who at that time lived in Brooklyn, New York, in United States, he was not happy with the family that I was living, because they were not religious Jewish. They were nice people, Jewish, but they were not Orthodox like he was. He was Hassidic Orthodox Jew. So he contacted [indecipherable] my uncle, my other uncle, and \u2014 and he ask him to sign that my parents were Orthodox, and they wanted me to be Orthodox. So my case became in a court, in Israeli court, and it took long time in Israeli court, and finally the Israeli court decided that I have to be removed for religious reason from \u2014 from Goldschmidt, from my foster family. So, after living in the house four and a half years, I was ordered by the court to remove, if not the ca \u2014 the fa-family would be arrested. So the family had to give me up, and they put me in a \u2014 in a Orthodox boarding school in Israel, and that was in a \u2014 and I\u2019m thinking a la \u2014 not Ramat Gan, that\u2019s was in Benai Brak, very religious place, and they send me to a religious school there, public school, a religious public school there, and to learn the religion. Well, my uncle aimed to bring me to United States, that was in 1953. And I refused to come to United States at the time because I hated him for doing what he did. So that came another family, and they told me that my uncle died, and they wanted to bring me to their house, to give me a home. I do not know who they Interview with Esther Fol \" November 8, 2008 were. And that family had twins. Babies, two ba \u2014 twins, and I do not know. I found out later on that \u2014 that my uncle just send me a letter, that couldn't be that he died. So, it didn\u2019t work out. But then [indecipherable] so it didn\u2019t work out that way. And then I moved to Ramat Gan, that\u2019s another religious boarding school Ra\u2019anana. Ra\u2019anana in Ra\u2019anana \u2014 Ra\u2019anana, I\u2019m sorry, in Kfar Batya, Ra\u2019anana. That\u2019s a boarding school that I lived there, a elementary school, I was there a few years until 19 \u2014 until my first year \u2014 I finished there my first year high school, and then I asked to be moved to kibbutz. I went to Kibbutz Yavne, that\u2019s a religious school, high school, my second year high school in Israel, and I wasn\u2019t happy there. I didn\u2019t like the place. So \u2014 kibbutz life, whatever it was. So I took a test and I got into a school, for lab technician school. That\u2019s a high school combination with a profession with a lab. So we had four year \u2014 four hours a day, five days a week laboratory, and the rest is a\u2014 mainly was concentrate on chemistry. That\u2019s how I started my [indecipherable] learning chemistry. Well, it started in high school. I was very good in math and sciences. And that\u2019s due to my foster family, maybe, they taught me the \u2014 when my foster mother was sitting with me every day to teach me, when I was living in their house, and that\u2019s how I got good in all these areas. I now focus a lot on school now, no more \u2014 I didn\u2019t have nothing else to focus on, so it was school. I was a very good student, and I lived one Interview with Esther Fol \" November 8, 2008 year in \u2014 in the Kibbutz Yavne. And then I went to Ramat Gan, to another family, a family that was also Holocaust survivor from Hungary, I forgot the names. And they had the number on their hand. She was one of that that made experiment on her, that doctor \u2014"

And Helena Westerly, and we became good friends. I look at her like somebody important to me, that was important because she did visit at me, not every day, was too dangerous during the war, while it was in a children home there, in Slonim.

And by the time I get there, and I said book. And I had difficulty say th-the rest of it. So they knew that I have to bring a book for them, and that\u2019s how it was. But I got used to all this, but when I came to Israel, they have the \u2014 I remember I was with my friends, the neighbors were my friends, and they were the same age I was, and they \u2014 the plan was, that time, I think, after the war of \u201948, or whatever, I do not know, the plans was there from the [indecipherable] that everybody tells me, you got to go down on the ground.
