It was almost accidental, certainly not historically awaited, and that is, I was -- my parents were at that time living in a town on the Vistula River before it goes into the Gdansk Bay. The name is Gludjan. However that time there were no, very few Jewish people, perhaps, and no rabbis and no moyels and so my mother in her eighth or ninth month of pregnancy went by train two days back to Brezany where a midwife would deliver just a girl."

And in 1938 my family was forced to leave the corridor or and went to Bialystok, and that was an entirely different part of Poland. It was the formerly Russian part. Poland was under occupation for 150 years, and that part of Poland was a czarist part. So everybody spoke Russian and it had the looks of a Russian part. It was poorly maintained streets, whereas Gludjan was a western German, typically German town, and in 1938 for one year I attended the 4\" grade of junior high school, Polish junior high school in the so-called Druszki Gymnasium which was the most expensive but very modern academically very advanced junior high school and high school.

The Soviets occupied as part of Poland. This was the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement. It was fortunate for us as I told you before. The Germans did come to Belsic for one week and promised us a proper, final solution even then, but the Soviets intervened and so we lived under Soviet occupation and most ordinary people, and especially from the viewpoint of a child we had a very good time. This was the time when they sort of tried to schmaltz up to us kids, tried to get us to the Pioneer Organization and the Counselor Organization and politicized us and etc., etc., etc. Pll never forget myself screaming at our landlord: \u2018if you don\u2019t fix that toilet ?'m going to tell on you.\u2019 This was the time, but generally it was a normal time."

They were very careful about anti-Semitism. They put people in jail for anti-Semitic expression, so I saw absolutely, I saw nothing, but of course my friends whose fathers were factory owners and such were sent to Siberia."

Apparently if the workers testified and intervened they might have been given some jail sentence but their family was not removed and otherwise they were removed especially if they were very wealthy and didn\u2019t get out. Most people who had that kind of money could also get out because Lithuania at the beginning was not yet a Soviet republic until 1940. There were quite a few months and many people did go through Lithuania, Romania and such. Some even got to Palestine at that time. Many had gone to China and so forth."

And that let out most of the Jewish boys and girls that I knew. They were all daughters and sons of lower merchants and merchants and as I\u2019m told by a friend whom I know now, my parents were stuck up. And I missed on this and I interpreted all this as it was I who wasn\u2019t popular, nobody liked me, I had no friends and so forth.

This was a Polish girls\u2019 Gymnasium; I was the only Jewish child in class, but so good a student that I was always at the top of the list all the time. But I wasn\u2019t very happy as very young teenager. Also most of the kids, they were a little older than I was and looked down upon me. But when I went to Bialystople, that made my day. I was in a Jewish school with all Jewish girls and boys who all loved me. I became not only popular but I was voted in a an S.0.G.O. whatever, students\u2019 organization president prior to the coming of the Soviets, and then after that when the Soviets marched in I ran into a problem because they voted me in but the Soviets didn\u2019t want to have a non-Communist, and I proudly announced that I was a Zionist. Well, that was the worst thing you should have stated. They were forced by my colleagues to let me be, to be the president of their Utchcom the student committee, but at home my mother packed my valise and waited for the NK VV then -- the KGB now -- to come and take me away cause nobody ever heard for a little pipsqueak of a teenager pronouncing proudly -- that I defended -- that was a left-wing Zionism and very close to Marxism. In fact, Marxists, the Zionists and we the Jews have the same right to feel proud of our nationality, as did the other Soviet republics. I in essence negated the Jewish question of Stalin, the little pamphlet, that the Jews are not really a nation because they don\u2019t have a land of their own."

I was very easily swayed to look the other way and then I joined the Pioneers, you know, which wasn\u2019t much of a plan either, and I sort of had the left-winger\u2019s leniency because of my revolt against my parents and my grandparents. I played with daughters of supers in the house and working kids and so forth. So, in Soviet Bialystok I was very busy with political affairs of the school. I was on the committee and I was in charge of the newspaper and what not, very, very involved with that. Very little time for my poor mother, and it was the first time in her life that she didn\u2019t have a servant. You had to have a doctor\u2019s certificate to be entitled to a maid and she didn\u2019t have. I feel very guilty about that."

And based on that I was able to get my Regents, my graduation diploma because the list of these otlichnica was kept somewhere. I came here to the Soviet consulate, where they piously tried to say to me what are you doing in America, you should go back to the Soviet Union.

I don\u2019t know, besides the leaders who were sent out, some of them, most of them I think, switched.

And it was my sister who was hidden by my aunt for whom Aryan papers, a birth certificate of a deceased gentile Christian child. These papers were bought and she was taken by a guide to another part of Poland, given to a Christian family who were told that she\u2019s the daughter of Polish officers who were executed by the Russians. And subsequent to that I discovered that she was christened by the guide, now that he didn\u2019t tell my aunt. It was just a matter of her giving him a certain amount of gold, dental gold, I suppose, and something, and that\u2019s how my sister became Christian, and she was on her way intercepted by a German officer who said \u201cYude!\u201d to her, because she looks very Jewish. She became frightened. The guide told him, \u201cOH, no, no, no, no, no -- I mean here are the papers, blah, blah--\u201c\u2018 She ran out and locked herself up in a bathroom, refused to leave. It was a tough time.

The tank never came, but an old German came -- a wee old Wehrmacht who was not involved with the Ukrainians, but he was truly helping people settle down on their march towards the train where they were going to be taken, because they were wearing kid gloves with us.

So we stayed in Blitzen and started hearing big guns going off in the East. I went through dysentery and a severe one. I went through typhoid fever, typhus because we were knitting the soldiers\u2019 socks and they came with lice. It was a very big epidemic, lots of people died. I not only didn\u2019t, if you want to know how easily I survived. Because I was a sports-minded, (?) kind of girl. I had typhus and the German doctor disbelieved it because I was picked up from the factory with very high fever, walking. So he personally came to the hospital to examine me and that wasn\u2019t done by German doctors. Because he didn\u2019t believe -- it was after everybody had their typhus, I came down with it. He found that my spleen was yet to be enlarged but everybody had to go through 14 or 16 days. I was done with it in 12. After 14 or 16 days people were just lying and I stood and nothing happened. Furthermore, I ate and nobody ate. So I was never really very skinny because I utilized my fat and I was taught sparingly so I survived the typhus very well."

This painting I have, I made it. It\u2019s in my family. The place didn\u2019t have windows, it had skylights, painted. They waited there until the black (?) was completely enclosed. Most barracks were just free, that one had a little enclosure and grating with wires. At night, a black truck would come and take them to be gassed. So the next morning after a night of anguish and guilt feeling, why didn\u2019t I go with her? Somebody came and said, she isn\u2019t gassed, that\u2019s where she is. I went there and lo and behold, the door was open. Later I learned that there was an explosion in the gas chamber. There was an uprising, they went up with it. Then something, I think the Swiss commission, whatever it was, my mother was there because they separated the old from the younger. Still this kind of selection going on, in part because now they really were taking the young ones to work. They didn\u2019t know yet how they\u2019re going to kill the old, the older people.

They didn\u2019t know if we were army women. They never saw Jews. We were the first liberated Jewish women yet. So we let the Americans pass and sat in the ditch.

I was wise enough to say I better get out of here. Where do I go, I always wanted to go to the university, mind you. I went to Berlin Medical School and it was raining through the roof which was non-existent. They told me the only university which is totally intact is Heidelberg. That sounded great so I had a story. I came to them and said, my medical school told me that I can get a transfer to Heidelberg. I did go to Heidelberg and I said let me know when the papers come from Great Britain. I went to Heidelberg and that was the first time where I became me. Not only did I become me, I enrolled at the university as an under-student but the Philadelphia Inquirer ran pictures of me. Here they are. This was all in the Philadelphia Inquirer playing the piano. You see that Iam corpulent. This is the UNRRA officer and I am sitting in the office. This is Ruth Krager that was in my girls\u2019 dorm. This is the JWV, Jewish center where the GI\u2019s met with the Jewish girls and we had our salami and coke, salami sandwich and coke. These papers appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer and my cousin is in Philadelphia and they discovered a survivor, one lonely survivor there, me. A telegram came, registered to the American council for a visa. At the time where I had already applied for savant (?) because I did speak French. I decided to go to America. Before that time, a little bit before that happened in Heidelberg, a very strange thing occurred. Because I am not an English speaking person and because my behavior was very much like that of gentiles and Wasps and because there was preconceived notion of children of immigrants who came here from the little shtetls without manners and without this and that, that I couldn\u2019t be Jewish. I was summoned before the and I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish -- in other words, I just didn\u2019t fit. The other Jewish boys and girls even at the medical school were more like the type that you would find among New York Jewish people for instance. It was just a total bias. I was summoned to prove that I was Jewish. I was questioned by a Canadian head of the Joint Distribution Committee to prove to them that I was Jewish before I get the toothpaste and the toothbrush or whatever else."

We all signed stateless, we were furious with the Poles. Why would he want me to prove I was Jewish? Surely I wasn\u2019t German, so what was I, Polish? Why couldn\u2019t you give me a toothpaste and toothbrush to a Polish girl? That was horrible, I will never forget this denigrating experience. But eventually my visa didn\u2019t come, I didn\u2019t wait and meanwhile Truman signed a 2,000 person collective visa for professional students and such. I was asked to sign that. I came here on that collective visa and my visa went to somebody else."

I stayed with my relatives for a while. I knew English well enough to immediately enter Hunter College. Tried to get to medical school, didn\u2019t have the money. I knew Russian, taught myself to type and worked as a translator for Russians who went to school. One of these days, I was introduced by This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She was hidden by the Ukrainian family -- that my grandmother couldn\u2019t get off the bed. She was clubbed to death and that my aunt and my cousin, my girl cousin, were taken away. What happened after that, I don\u2019t know if they were shot, executed on the cemetery or wherever or taken to a camp to be executed. Somehow I have the feeling that somebody said my little cousin was trying to run away. He did look Aryan, he was blond and all this."

There was south, they could have taken -- no, Bergen-Belsen was liberated maybe 15 days later so that entire front line was really broken through. The only way they could go is a little further east.

That\u2019s why they are marching us there but never got there. That Polish soldier, I told the American. I said now look, he was kind, he was helpful. I said at least question him. I was under the assumption he was going to be shot. Because later on I did some things I shouldn\u2019t have done. Women captured a horrible, horrible overseer who\u2019s beating, in Germany, beating the women merciless. The captain Lubetsky designed a scheme. He says if I give him to the CID forget it. With the white gloves nothing\u2019s going to be done. I know what we\u2019ll going to do. I have a dumb so-and-so southerner. I will tell him that if this guy budges, he\u2019s to shoot. I\u2019m going to stand there and I\u2019m going to call for him to come to me. Don\u2019t say a word, he said to me. I said okay at first. This procedure was being enacted, something drove me out of it. I screamed, no, don\u2019t you dare to do it and spoiled the story. He said why did you? I says killed in battle but kill, his wife and children are standing, that\u2019s not a revenge. We are not vengeful people and that is what I would like to say to the blacks who executed a Jew. We didn\u2019t do it, very few cases where the people got out of camps and killed Germans. You would have heard about them. We are not vengeful people and I didn\u2019t have it in me at that point, at least, or now. I am not able to go to Germany and enjoy it, sightsee at this point because of the things that have been happening. I cringed when I meet Germans who are the proper age and start questioning me where from Poland, where am I from? I see the type but beyond this ---. \u201cNever again\u201d means don\u2019t let it go and get to that point. That was before. At this point I am most concerned with anti-Semitism whereas before I was concerned with all kinds of biases. This type of development is taking place; I think that this is the most atrocious and vicious because it singles one particular group of people to cure all ills anywhere you go.

So it\u2019s much worse than blacks because they\u2019re not being singled out all over the world. But Jews are, even in Japan, that never had and doesn\u2019t have Jews. Now I\u2019m saying charity begins at home. I put all of my efforts trying to stop this vicious happening. That\u2019s just the way it 1s."
