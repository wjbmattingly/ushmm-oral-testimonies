It was almost accidental, certainly not historically awaited, and that is, I was -- my parents were at that time living in a town on the Vistula River before it goes into the Gdansk Bay. The name is Gludjan. However that time there were no, very few Jewish people, perhaps, and no rabbis and no moyels and so my mother in her eighth or ninth month of pregnancy went by train two days back to Brezany where a midwife would deliver just a girl."

            "question": "And you grew up not in Brezany but in Gludjan?",
            "answer": "Gludjan. Until 1938 I lived in that part. It was known as the corridor. It was everybody\u2019s transit point since ancient times, since the Teutonic orders yet. And in 1938 my family was forced to leave the corridor or and went to Bialystok, and that was an entirely different part of Poland. It was the formerly Russian part. Poland was under occupation for 150 years, and that part of Poland was a czarist part. So everybody spoke Russian and it had the looks of a Russian part. It was poorly maintained streets, whereas Gludjan was a western German, typically German town, and in 1938 for one year I attended the 4\" grade of junior high school, Polish junior high school in the so-called Druszki Gymnasium which was the most expensive but very modern academically very advanced junior high school and high school. And then I entered the high school in 1939 but the high school became in the Soviet 10\" year school . The Soviets occupied as part of Poland. This was the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement. It was fortunate for us as I told you before. The Germans did come to Belsic for one week and promised us a proper, final solution even then, but the Soviets intervened and so we lived under Soviet occupation and most ordinary people, and especially from the viewpoint of a child we had a very good time. This was the time when they sort of tried to schmaltz up to us kids, tried to get us to the Pioneer Organization and the Counselor Organization and politicized us and etc., etc., etc. Pll never forget myself screaming at our landlord: \u2018if you don\u2019t fix that toilet ?'m going to tell on you.\u2019 This was the time, but generally it was a normal time."

They were very careful about anti-Semitism. They put people in jail for anti-Semitic expression, so I saw absolutely, I saw nothing, but of course my friends whose fathers were factory owners and such were sent to Siberia."

            "answer": "Bring class enemy having employed and not having workers testifying for them. Apparently if the workers testified and intervened they might have been given some jail sentence but their family was not removed and otherwise they were removed especially if they were very wealthy and didn\u2019t get out. Most people who had that kind of money could also get out because Lithuania at the beginning was not yet a Soviet republic until 1940. There were quite a few months and many people did go through Lithuania, Romania and such. Some even got to Palestine at that time. Many had gone to China and so forth."

You see, I was nineteen and a half when the war finished and was still adoptable. I think it was still until twenty-one. And he adopted me. But I didn\u2019t know and I went to the United States and he was just heartbroken, and I would have been his daughter in Israel while I was already in the United States."

            "question": "Could you tell us more about growing up in Poland, as a little girl and then as a young adult?",
            "answer": "Well, the times I had in Grujan were not particularly happy for me personally because I had a very strict father, still the Austrian school where you\u2019ve got to be home on time, you can\u2019t go -- you can\u2019t pal around with somebody whom we don\u2019t know. And that let out most of the Jewish boys and girls that I knew. They were all daughters and sons of lower merchants and merchants and as I\u2019m told by a friend whom I know now, my parents were stuck up. And I missed on this and I interpreted all this as it was I who wasn\u2019t popular, nobody liked me, I had no friends and so forth. And I became --I was very bright, and excellent student, so I didn\u2019t suffer any anti- Semitism. This was a Polish girls\u2019 Gymnasium; I was the only Jewish child in class, but so good a student that I was always at the top of the list all the time. But I wasn\u2019t very happy as very young teenager. Also most of the kids, they were a little older than I was and looked down upon me. But when I went to Bialystople, that made my day. I was in a Jewish school with all Jewish girls and boys who all loved me. I became not only popular but I was voted in a an S.0.G.O. whatever, students\u2019 organization president prior to the coming of the Soviets, and then after that when the Soviets marched in I ran into a problem because they voted me in but the Soviets didn\u2019t want to have a non-Communist, and I proudly announced that I was a Zionist. Well, that was the worst thing you should have stated. They were forced by my colleagues to let me be, to be the president of their Utchcom the student committee, but at home my mother packed my valise and waited for the NK VV then -- the KGB now -- to come and take me away cause nobody ever heard for a little pipsqueak of a teenager pronouncing proudly -- that I defended -- that was a left-wing Zionism and very close to Marxism. In fact, Marxists, the Zionists and we the Jews have the same right to feel proud of our nationality, as did the other Soviet republics. I in essence negated the Jewish question of Stalin, the little pamphlet, that the Jews are not really a nation because they don\u2019t have a land of their own."

            "answer": "It sort of disappeared on me. I was very easily swayed to look the other way and then I joined the Pioneers, you know, which wasn\u2019t much of a plan either, and I sort of had the left-winger\u2019s leniency because of my revolt against my parents and my grandparents. I played with daughters of supers in the house and working kids and so forth. So, in Soviet Bialystok I was very busy with political affairs of the school. I was on the committee and I was in charge of the newspaper and what not, very, very involved with that. Very little time for my poor mother, and it was the first time in her life that she didn\u2019t have a servant. You had to have a doctor\u2019s certificate to be entitled to a maid and she didn\u2019t have. I feel very guilty about that."

And based on that I was able to get my Regents, my graduation diploma because the list of these otlichnica was kept somewhere. I came here to the Soviet consulate, where they piously tried to say to me what are you doing in America, you should go back to the Soviet Union. But they did get me testimony of so-and-so, I gave the name of my director that I was a very good student ---- otlichnica."

It was just the beginning; no, after that I never owned up to anything other, oh, I fervently, I very much -- I really enjoyed what was happening. You have to understand this. They made us, as kids feel very important. I discussed this with the people who survived that. We all had the same feeling. Who cared what they did to the grownups, or the capitalists. I mean we were kids and they had all kinds of things for the kids. They had a way of getting us."

I don\u2019t know, besides the leaders who were sent out, some of them, most of them I think, switched. They had a large workers population that possibly support them and the rest were as anybody else. I was very opportunistic. That was the way to get ajob. That was the way to get ahead and my father had a warm feeling about the Soviets because really they saved his life, you know. He was caught up in the revolution. He was captured as an Austrian prisoner of war and when they took him out of that prison, it was going from whites to reds, from whites to reds, and the reds ---"

He was the oldest of three children of my grandfather who always impressed me as an Austrian sergeant who marches through town and everybody would bow to him and that again was an old Austrian household with a very strict father and I guess my father perpetuated this.

My parents were keeping tradition in a modern sense. All these modern children\u2019s holidays were maintained. The little community in --- maintained all the holidays and they had a Zionist organization to which I was not allowed to belong but nevertheless I was taught Hebrew. They imported a teacher from Warsaw, a young man who taught us boys and girls Modern Hebrew and religion with it. To that extent we were Jewish, with all the holidays maintained more or less the way American Jews, those who are not Orthodox, the sort of social life centering around the suburban synagogue, the reform temple.

He went back to Lumber and whatever pedagogy classes and music appreciation and whatever else he had to do and took exams with everybody at home frightened out of their wits while he was studying and took the exams one or two or three evenings and passed and got his license. And he started teaching music in a German school, Folkschule and Gymnasium which 1s the high school, more than a high school. A high school plus. And that\u2019s how he finished his career. He was always a musician; once a musician, always a musician. So he still entertained for the Jewish community, and he gave of himself or organized a mandolin orchestra; he was an extremely gifted musician. He played one, two, three, four, maybe five instruments besides the violin. He orchestrated his own music. He wrote excellent scores for the silent movies. This was a gift. He was an excellent conductor also, a very --- I watch some and I see -- very sad -- when I think of my father; that\u2019s the kind he was, and very gifted, wrote his own music, orchestrated almost anything and he performed all through his life with the children. Kids were very fond of him; he was very handsome. Now I have friends who would say \u201cHah, well of course he looked at me once or twice!\u201d"

And indeed I had a connection, but at first I had to get to know him. So I did get to know him. We fell in love and both of us fell in love and he stayed in our house. My parents were -- because his parents were -- his mother and brother were shot in front of his eyes, and a Lithuanian guard knew him from the school and pulled him out and started -- he didn\u2019t look Jewish -- he says, \u201c\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d -- and got him out, so he was saved. Shot badly.

So that\u2019s the time, on that night before the final solution and that had to be September 4\" or 5\", one of those because my birthday is September 6\" and I was already on -- waiting for the train. We staged, we had it in plan, but now the orders were given. So I was given an order in the morning to go in such and such a place with a grenade and wait for the tank and the tank was going to come and I was told where it was going to come, only I didn\u2019t know how to use that grenade, and I\u2019d seen enough cowboy movies and such type movies where I knew you had to pull something with your teeth, but which part, and what do you do with it? And so I went there and they were firing; we had guns -- it was an uprising. We were -- I don\u2019t know what they were shooting. They were shooting Germans or Ukrainians or something and I was supposed to stand there and wait for the tank. The tank never came, but an old German came -- a wee old Wehrmacht who was not involved with the Ukrainians, but he was truly helping people settle down on their march towards the train where they were going to be taken, because they were wearing kid gloves with us. All alone, nobody was shot at that point. That was one of the gimmicks. \u201cOh come on, you know you\u2019re not going to die. You know that you\u2019ve worked for the Germans.

How do I go? Where do I go?\u201d Nowhere. I got to that square and I became frantic because I saw the steam houses. I was sure this was the gas chamber, and no escape. And again, around the friendly faces of the Ukrainians, I tried to talk Ukrainian to them. \u201cOh, you know, I\u2019m really --\u201c\u2018 I was just out of my wits. Towards the morning I said to myself. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to live.\u201d And all of a sudden I came to my mother and I said, \u201cYou know what, I have a feeling we\u2019re going to live. Now let\u2019s stop that.\u201d Oh, my God, she was petrified. I said, \u201cUh, uh, something tells me I\u2019m going to live.\u201d And I turned around to the others; I said, \u201cLet\u2019s stop being stupid. If they wanted to exterminate us, why did they bring us here and not there?\u201d I was partially right because they did have a selection right there. I was able to push my mother with me and we went to the bath instead of the gas chamber. We got out, the others never did.

Instead of being brought to where we were on top of the field, we were lined up at the bottom of the field precisely at the time that a factory camp like the one described in the book was looking for seamstresses, just for seamstresses. I knew if they say seamstresses from a concentration camp, you raise your hand, oh, yes you are a seamstress. So I raised my hand and the SS woman was picking out specifically fair, gentile-looking, young girls. That was me and in the back of me was my mother.

Made a lot of money but they were all converted to concentration camps. Now without the Wannsee Conference, they were planning for mass executions. So we stayed in Blitzen and started hearing big guns going off in the East. I went through dysentery and a severe one. I went through typhoid fever, typhus because we were knitting the soldiers\u2019 socks and they came with lice. It was a very big epidemic, lots of people died. I not only didn\u2019t, if you want to know how easily I survived. Because I was a sports-minded, (?) kind of girl. I had typhus and the German doctor disbelieved it because I was picked up from the factory with very high fever, walking. So he personally came to the hospital to examine me and that wasn\u2019t done by German doctors. Because he didn\u2019t believe -- it was after everybody had their typhus, I came down with it. He found that my spleen was yet to be enlarged but everybody had to go through 14 or 16 days. I was done with it in 12. After 14 or 16 days people were just lying and I stood and nothing happened. Furthermore, I ate and nobody ate. So I was never really very skinny because I utilized my fat and I was taught sparingly so I survived the typhus very well."

So the next morning after a night of anguish and guilt feeling, why didn\u2019t I go with her? Somebody came and said, she isn\u2019t gassed, that\u2019s where she is. I went there and lo and behold, the door was open. Later I learned that there was an explosion in the gas chamber. There was an uprising, they went up with it. Then something, I think the Swiss commission, whatever it was, my mother was there because they separated the old from the younger. Still this kind of selection going on, in part because now they really were taking the young ones to work. They didn\u2019t know yet how they\u2019re going to kill the old, the older people. I came to her every day and even there they had a selection because the Theresienstadt women came."

            "answer": "In a sense. I was in a different group. Then things became very bad with me. It may have been the beginning of typhoid fever or it may have simply been the food or it may have been an ulcer but I was vomiting. I was taking whatever it was in the morning and vomiting. Taking whatever it was later and vomiting. I knew that that meant that I would die and my mother would see me die. I then decided I'll take a chance. They were taking people, some to work and others to be killed and others to different camps. We were quite close to the front line with the Russians. The Russians came in January, I think; this was November. So I spoke with my mother and I said I am going to try to get you on the list of the capable work. You\u2019re not that old, don\u2019t act old. Act young, perk up and so forth and you will yet go to work. But I can\u2019t wait because I\u2019m dying, I\u2019ve got to get out. Something in the water, or something in the food but I can\u2019t hold it. Yes, she said, I, somehow through a doctor, reached, and there was another one, Weiss I think was his name, a German doctor who was making the selections. He put on the list of those who were capable of work. The rest of those people were left in that place were liberated by the Russians. But my poor mother was taken, with the people who were on the list, on the death march to Bergen-Belsen."

At the end of March, they marched us out of that L towards Buchenwald only they didn\u2019t get too far. They came to a little village Kaunitz, K-a-u-n-i-t-z. I might visit it if I have enough nerve. We sat in the ditches and right in front of us, there moved a jeep with a white star on it. We had better sense than say a boo. First of all, they probably wouldn\u2019t have heard us and second of all, we could have been shot. We looked like the army, later on the patrolling airplane told us they didn\u2019t know what the hell was going. They\u2019d never seen anything like it. We each wore an army blanket on us. They didn\u2019t know if we were army women. They never saw Jews. We were the first liberated Jewish women yet. So we let the Americans pass and sat in the ditch. All of a sudden all of our SS disappeared on us. The overseer, his mistress, everybody except for the Polish SS. He said, Pan (?), he called me Irene, you remember don\u2019t you? I says yes, I remember, stay with us. We saw the whole village was hanging white flags out. At that point I became a front-runner because I knew English."

He gave me, I said are you sure you\u2019re not British? They all started laughing and they asked me who I was. I told them and he said, I don\u2019t believe it. He called in so and so and they came over to us and took out their mezuzah and asked me to identify.. I told them what it was, So they what they call organized, they didn\u2019t organize those tanks right away. They occupied the whole village and kicked the Germans out and said girls, this is yours. Everything 1n it and we will bring you more. And they did! Clothes and chocolate, started pushing on us, crying some of these guys. You are the first surviving girls yet. We can fraternize with you, you\u2019re not German. It was something first for the -- especially the Jewish GI\u2019s. We stayed in that village and that\u2019s when I met Captain Lubetsky who was in charge of the American garrison there who was looking for an interpreter. I was walking with a frying pan to the burgomeister to have it fixed. That\u2019s how brazen we were. Hey toots, said he, and proceeded to talk to me and discovered because I spoke Russian and he was in charge of the PW and DP camps. Come on, he said, you\u2019re going to be working with us. What kind of house would you like? I said with a piano. Okay it will be with a piano. They found a house with a piano and I was working with the army all through. Then the British came and took over. Again I worked with the British and recuperated and traveled to Bergen-Belsen to find my mother. But what was in my mind was what my uncle said. You find your sister. So sometimes in November, I declared myself to be a Soviet citizen because that\u2019s where I thought my sister was. They needed somebody to accompany the Soviets, the PW\u2019s who refused to go back home to the Ukraine which would have been where I wanted to go. I went with them."

From there I went to Poland, to a Jewish committee in Prague. They looked up lists and yes, your aunt 1s in such-and-such place. I went there and they greeted me with where is your mother? We heard she was alive. I went to tell them the story and -- why did you leave her? Can you imagine having this kind of greeting. I needed a psychiatrist right there! They told me, yes, your sister is alive but she never told these people that she\u2019s Jewish. She\u2019s going out with a boy who doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s Jewish.

No, no, she had a boyfriend, her church and so forth. I left and the only way I could go is with the Germans who were being sent to Germany from the Polish part.

This is not a German girl, don\u2019t be fooling around. They were raping Germans. This is the way I got to Berlin, West Berlin, into a British citizen camp which also had the AKA and the AKA army, Those soldiers were telling me, you can tell them the truth now. You don\u2019t have to tell them you\u2019re a British subject by birth here. Oh, no I said. What do you mean, my father, my mother, now I don\u2019t remember who was British. I went back because of my mother or because of my father but my whole family\u2019s there. I was questioned by the British and I am sure that they didn\u2019t believe one word of what I was saying but I was much too young to know from such things. I maintained my story. I was afraid they would send me back. I didn\u2019t tell them and I couldn\u2019t get out of the situation because they had written to Great Britain, it would have come out. I was wise enough to say I better get out of here. Where do I go, I always wanted to go to the university, mind you. I went to Berlin Medical School and it was raining through the roof which was non-existent. They told me the only university which is totally intact is Heidelberg. That sounded great so I had a story. I came to them and said, my medical school told me that I can get a transfer to Heidelberg. I did go to Heidelberg and I said let me know when the papers come from Great Britain. I went to Heidelberg and that was the first time where I became me. Not only did I become me, I enrolled at the university as an under-student but the Philadelphia Inquirer ran pictures of me. Here they are. This was all in the Philadelphia Inquirer playing the piano. You see that Iam corpulent. This is the UNRRA officer and I am sitting in the office. This is Ruth Krager that was in my girls\u2019 dorm. This is the JWV, Jewish center where the GI\u2019s met with the Jewish girls and we had our salami and coke, salami sandwich and coke. These papers appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer and my cousin is in Philadelphia and they discovered a survivor, one lonely survivor there, me. A telegram came, registered to the American council for a visa. At the time where I had already applied for savant (?) because I did speak French. I decided to go to America. Before that time, a little bit before that happened in Heidelberg, a very strange thing occurred. Because I am not an English speaking person and because my behavior was very much like that of gentiles and Wasps and because there was preconceived notion of children of immigrants who came here from the little shtetls without manners and without this and that, that I couldn\u2019t be Jewish. I was summoned before the and I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish -- in other words, I just didn\u2019t fit. The other Jewish boys and girls even at the medical school were more like the type that you would find among New York Jewish people for instance. It was just a total bias. I was summoned to prove that I was Jewish. I was questioned by a Canadian head of the Joint Distribution Committee to prove to them that I was Jewish before I get the toothpaste and the toothbrush or whatever else."

I didn\u2019t have enough guts and knowledge to just tell this guy what here the Polish organization was begging me to sign that I am Polish and give me anything just to sign. We all signed stateless, we were furious with the Poles. Why would he want me to prove I was Jewish? Surely I wasn\u2019t German, so what was I, Polish?

            "answer": "In an easterly direction -- we were between the two fighting armies. They had no way, we were almost at the American lines, we couldn\u2019t go west. There was south, they could have taken -- no, Bergen-Belsen was liberated maybe 15 days later so that entire front line was really broken through. The only way they could go is a little further east. That indeed took a longer time. Buchenwald was liberated much worse, much later and was in a worse shape."

            "answer": "They had an order because each working camp was known as the ouserkommando and we were ouserkommando of Buchenwald. That\u2019s why they are marching us there but never got there. That Polish soldier, I told the American. I said now look, he was kind, he was helpful. I said at least question him. I was under the assumption he was going to be shot. Because later on I did some things I shouldn\u2019t have done. Women captured a horrible, horrible overseer who\u2019s beating, in Germany, beating the women merciless. The captain Lubetsky designed a scheme. He says if I give him to the CID forget it. With the white gloves nothing\u2019s going to be done. I know what we\u2019ll going to do. I have a dumb so-and-so southerner. I will tell him that if this guy budges, he\u2019s to shoot. I\u2019m going to stand there and I\u2019m going to call for him to come to me. Don\u2019t say a word, he said to me. I said okay at first. This procedure was being enacted, something drove me out of it. I screamed, no, don\u2019t you dare to do it and spoiled the story. He said why did you? I says killed in battle but kill, his wife and children are standing, that\u2019s not a revenge. We are not vengeful people and that is what I would like to say to the blacks who executed a Jew. We didn\u2019t do it, very few cases where the people got out of camps and killed Germans. You would have heard about them. We are not vengeful people and I didn\u2019t have it in me at that point, at least, or now. I am not able to go to Germany and enjoy it, sightsee at this point because of the things that have been happening. I cringed when I meet Germans who are the proper age and start questioning me where from Poland, where am I from? I see the type but beyond this ---. \u201cNever again\u201d means don\u2019t let it go and get to that point. That was before. At this point I am most concerned with anti-Semitism whereas before I was concerned with all kinds of biases. This type of development is taking place; I think that this is the most atrocious and vicious because it singles one particular group of people to cure all ills anywhere you go. You name a country where there was no anti-Semitism and no killing of Jews. So it\u2019s much worse than blacks because they\u2019re not being singled out all over the world. But Jews are, even in Japan, that never had and doesn\u2019t have Jews. Now I\u2019m saying charity begins at home. I put all of my efforts trying to stop this vicious happening. That\u2019s just the way it 1s."
