But I wasn\u2122t very happy as very young teenager. Also most of the kids, they were a little older than I was and looked down upon me. But when I went to Bialystople, that ma de my day. I was in a Jewish school with all Jewish girls and boys who all loved me. I became not only popul ar but I was voted in a an S.O.G.O. whatever, students\u2122 orga nization president prior to the co ming of the Soviets, and then after that when the Soviets marched in I ran into a problem because they voted me in but the Soviets didn\u2122t want to have a non-Communist, and I proudly announced that I was a Zionist. Well, that was the worst thing you should have st ated. They were forced by my colleagues to let me be, to be the president of their Utchco m the student committee, but at home my mother packed my valise and waited for the NKVV then -- the KGB now -- to come and take me away cause nobody ever heard for a little pipsqueak of a teenager pronouncing proudly -- that I defended -- that was a left-wing Zionism and very close to Marxism. In fact, Marxists, the Zionists and we the Jews have the same right to feel proud of our nationality, as did the other Soviet republics. I in essence negated the Jewish question of Stalin, the little pamphlet, that the Jews are not really a nation because they don\u2122t have a land of their own. ",

And besides, they said, you are the spiritual kind of person, you write music -- I wrote some part of the songs -- you go to the ghetto and be in charge of our propaganda to get more and more people. So I, from the sort of a way station, went back. That was my first and only encounter, because the second time that there was a chance to go out I was in love with a boy and not ready to leave this -- that was that time -- and so we were caught."

The final solution -- we were going to be -- and we already knew about Treblinka because people were coming back and telling. So we knew there was no hope. So that\u2122s the time, on that night before the final solution and that had to be September 4 th or 5th, one of those because my birthday is September 6 th and I was already on -- waiting for the train. We staged, we had it in plan, but now the orders were given. So I was given an order in the morning to go in such and such a place with a grenade and wait for the tank and the tank was going to come and I was told where it was going to come, only I didn\u2122t know how to use that grenade, and I\u2122d seen enough cowboy movies and such type movies where I knew you had to pull something with your teeth, but which part, an d what do you do with it? And so I went there and they were firing; we had guns -- it was an uprising. We were -- I don\u2122t know what they were shooting. They were shooting Germans or Ukrainians or something and I was supposed to stand there and wait for the tank. The tank neve r came, but an old German came -- a wee old Wehrmacht who was not involved with the Ukrainia ns, but he was truly helping people settle down on their march towards the train where they were going to be taken, because they were wearing kid gloves with us. A ll alone, nobody was shot at that point. That was one of the gimmicks. \ufb01Oh come on, you know you\u2122re not going to die. You know that you\u2122ve worked for the Germans.

Made a lot of money but they were all converted to concentration camps. Now without the Wannsee Conference, they were planning for mass executions. So we stayed in Blitzen and started hearing big guns going off in the East. I went through dysentery and a severe one. I went through typhoid fever, typhus because we were knitting the soldiers\u2122 socks and they came w ith lice. It was a very big epidemic, lots of people died. I not only didn\u2122 t, if you want to know how easily I survived. Because I was a sports-minded, _______(?) kind of girl. I had typhus and the German doctor disbelieved it because I was picked up from the f actory with very high fever, walking. So he personally came to the hospital to examine me and that wasn\u2122t done by German doctors. Because he didn\u2122t believe -- it was after everybod y had their typhus, I came down with it. He found that my spleen was yet to be enlarged but everybody had to go through 14 or 16 days. I was done with it in 12. After 14 or 16 days pe ople were just lying and I stood and nothing happened. Furthermore, I ate and nobody ate. So I was never really very skinny because I utilized my fat and I was taught sparingl y so I survived the typhus very well."

I might visit it if I have enough nerve. We sat in the ditches and right in front of us, there moved a jeep with a white star on it. We had better se nse than say a boo. First of all, they probably wouldn\u2122t have heard us and second of all, we could have been shot. We looked like the army, later on the patrolling airplane told us they didn\u2122t know what the hell was going. They\u2122d never seen anything like it. We each wore an army blanket on us. They didn\u2122t know if we were army women. They never saw Jews. We were the firs t liberated Jewish women yet. So we let the Americans pass and sat in the ditch. All of a sudden all of our SS disappeared on us. The overseer, his mistress, everybody except for the Polish SS. He said, Pan_____(?), he called me Irene, you remember don\u2122t you? I says yes, I re member, stay with us. We saw the whole village was hanging white flags out. At that point I became a front -runner because I knew English."

He gave me, I said are you sure you\u2122re not British? They all started laughing and they asked me who I was. I told them and he said, I don\u2122t believe it. He called in so and so and they came over to us and took out their mezuzah and asked me to identify.. I told them what it was, So they what they call organized, they didn\u2122t organize t hose tanks right away. They occupied the whole village and kicked the Germans out and said girls, this is yours. Everything in it and we will bring you more. And they did! Clothes and chocolate, started pushing on us, crying some of these guys. You are the first surviving girls yet. We can fraternize with you, you\u2122re not German. It was something first for the -- especially the Jewish GI\u2122s . We stayed in that village and that\u2122s when I met Captain Lubetsky who was in charge of the American garrison there who was looking for an interpreter. I was walking with a frying pan to the burgomeister to have it fixed. That\u2122s how brazen we were. Hey toots, said he, and proceeded to talk to me and discovered because I spoke Russian and he was in charge of the PW and DP camps. Come on, he said, you\u2122re going to be working with us. What kind of house woul d you like? I said with a piano. Okay it will be with a piano. They found a house with a piano and I was working with the army all through. Then the British came and took over. Again I worked with the British and recuperated and traveled to Bergen-Belsen to find my mother. But what was in my mind was what my uncle said. You find your sister. So sometimes in Nove mber, I declared myself to be a Soviet citizen because that\u2122s where I thought my sister wa s.

They looked up lists and yes, your aunt is in such-and-such place. I went there and they greeted me with wh ere is your mother? We heard sh e was alive. I went to tell them the story and -- why did you leave her? Can you imagine having this kind of greeting. I needed a psychiatrist right there!

This is not a German girl, don\u2122t be fooling around. They were raping Germans. This is the way I got to Berlin, West Berlin, into a British citizen camp which also had the AKA and the AKA army, Those soldiers were telling me, you can tell them the truth now. You don\u2122t have to tell them you\u2122re a British subject by birth here. Oh, no I said. What do you mean, my father, my mother, now I don\u2122t remember who was British. I went back because of my mo ther or because of my father but my whole family\u2122s there. I was questioned by the British an d I am sure that they didn\u2122t believe one word of what I was saying but I was much too young to know from such things. I maintained my story. I was afraid they would send me back. I didn\u2122t tell them and I couldn\u2122t get out of the situation because they had written to Great Britain, it would have come out. I was wise enough to say I better get out of here. Where do I go, I always wanted to go to the university, mind you. I went to Berlin Medical School and it was raining through the roof which was non-existent. They told me the only university which is totally intact is Heidelberg. That sounded great so I had a story. I came to them and said, my medical school told me that I can get a transfer to Heidelberg. I did go to Heidelbe rg and I said let me know when the papers come from Great Britain. I went to Heidelberg and that was th e first time where I became me. Not only did I become me, I enrolled at the university as an under-student but the Ph iladelphia Inquirer ran pictures of me. Here they are. This was all in the Philadelphia Inquirer playing the piano. You see that I am corpulent. This is the UNRRA offi cer and I am sitting in the office. This is Ruth Krager that was in my girls\u2122 dorm. This is th e JWV, Jewish center wher e the GI\u2122s met with the Jewish girls and we had our salami and coke , salami sandwich and coke. These papers appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer and my co usin is in Philadelphi a and they discovered a survivor, one lonely survivor there, me. A telegr am came, registered to the American council for a visa. At the time where I had already applied for savant (?) because I did speak French. I decided to go to America. Before that time, a little bit before that happened in Heidelberg, a very strange thing occurred. Because I am not an English speaking person and because my behavior was very much like th at of gentiles and Wasps and because there was preconceived notion of children of immigrants who came here from the little shtetls without manners and without this and that, that I couldn\u2122t be Jewish. I was summone d before the and I didn\u2122t speak Yiddish -- in other words, I just didn\u2122t fit. The other Jewish boys and girls even at the medical school were more like the type that you would find among New York Jewish people for instance. It was just a total bias. I was summone d to prove that I was Jewish. I was questioned by a Canadian head of the Joint Distribution Committee to prove to them that I was Jewish before I get the toothpaste and the toothbrush or whatever else."

I was under the assumption he was going to be shot. Because later on I did some things I shouldn\u2122t have done. Women captured a horrible, horrible overseer who\u2122s beating, in Germany, beating the women merciless. The captain Lubetsky designed a scheme. He says if I give him to the CID forget it. With the white gloves nothing\u2122s going to be done. I know what we\u2122ll going to do. I have a dumb so-andso southerner. I will tell him that if this guy budges, he\u2122s to shoot. I\u2122m going to stand ther e and I\u2122m going to call for him to come to me. Don\u2122t say a word, he said to me. I said okay at first. This procedure was being enacted, something drove me out of it. I screamed, no, do n\u2122t you dare to do it and spoiled the story. He said why did you? I says killed in battle but kill, his wife and children are standing, that\u2122s not a revenge. We are not vengeful people and that is what I would like to say to the blacks who executed a Jew. We didn\u2122t do it, very few cases where the people got out of camps and killed Germans. You would have heard about them. We are not vengeful people and I didn\u2122t have it in me at that point, at least, or now. I am not able to go to Germany and enjoy it, sightsee at this point because of the things that have been happening. I cringed when I meet Germans who are the proper age and start questioning me where fr om Poland, where am I from? I see the type but beyond this ---. \ufb01Never again\ufb02 means don\u2122t let it go and get to that point. That was before. At this point I am most concerned with anti-S emitism whereas before I was concerned with all kinds of biases. This type of development is taking place; I think that this is the most atrocious and vicious because it singles one particular group of people to cure all ills anywhere you go. You name a country where there was no anti-Sem itism and no killing of Jews. So it\u2122s much worse than blacks because they\u2122re not being singled out all over the world. But Jews are, even in Japan, that never had and doesn\u2122t have Jews. Now I\u2122m saying ch arity begins at home. I put all of my efforts trying to stop this vici ous happening.
