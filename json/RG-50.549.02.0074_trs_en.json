            "answer": "Middle class, but attend to the pretty good gymnasium. The story was this way, my wi -- my father didn\u2019t believe there will be -- Poland will be free very long time, and he taught me that if I will be survive, I have to s-study in the gymnasium will be the good s -- good language. It was the to -- different schools it we -- I attend to the fi -- first -- first of all he ask me which language I prefer, Russian or German, because it was [indecipherable] I preferred German. Th-The reason I attend to the private s -- g-gymnasium Mikoyrai, what was practically run by the evangeli -- og -- evangi -- no -- the li -- evangelism ch-church, you know? And most these people, the student would attend was from the German family, they speak home German. That what there 1s, on that I was a very poor student with the German. Every year I have a student, you know, which teach me during the vacation. Usually my parents with another parents, you know, hired the student from the Germany, and to -- during the two months we sent for vacation, two or three guys, and tal -- two or three months we talk German only. If we say between us one word Polish, the guy beat us because he thought [indecipherable] that we\u2019re USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 : st -- talking something against him. Th-The reason when I come home I start talk to my mother, you know, the German. And -- and this was -- was very good because this -- th-thanks to this I survive. It was many times this, during the German occupation that I survived. The first -- first day when the German arrived, you know, on the [indecipherable] place, you know, they stop me, the French gendarmerie did, was the French gendarmerie and I was so upset, you know, because W-Warsaw survived -- surrendered, it was the first or second day, and the ger -- the -- they [indecipherable] the people you know, to cover the holes, which was where -- was for the [indecipherable] the bombs. And he ca -- ask me. You have to work in [indecipherable] what for? And I -- very friendly German, I talk with him, what for? [indecipherable] and he told -- he told me [indecipherable] me this, I\u2019m sorry for you. I was so surprised that this way. He think probably that I am German. It was the de -- the reason that many time during the action -- I remembered another time, during the German occupation, I have lot of friends, you know, what speaking for German [indecipherable] you know, and once during there was the people g -- wa -- catch the people to -- to German. We have -- we carry in the pocket, you know, the big sign, and [indecipherable] this was a sign [indecipherable] German member for the na-national [indecipherable] the national socialist [indecipherable], but I will put in the pocket and this way we -- we so like drunk, and to -- oh, you go away. It was the second time I survive, you know, like USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 \u00b0 young people drink? Risk, make a lot of risk. How many times they dri -- they going with the, you know, with the guns during -- because we make a lot of sabotage, lot of working against th-the Nazis. We make many, many different action. The action -- the first my -- action was like in 19 -- 1940 or \u201941, we put the ha -- to -- German got out, the Polish got out, you put the -- no, 1t wasn\u2019t a bomb burst, 1t was like a material would make a fire, what would burn the German tr-tr- trucks and the Polish trucks. You -- it was my first action. And then later we blow that -- I was trained, and we bl-blow that train. The same time I attend to the Polytech Institute because in the m -- in the beginning the German close the old school, and later they opened the school only for the technician school, you know, they need -- they don\u2019t -- they need only the people to work, the working people that there is on that -- they opened the school for the technician and this -- this way we working with -- and I attend to this -- this Polytechnic Institute, I study mechanic engineering. It wa-was not engineering [indecipherable] engineering, they call it technical, the engineering was too high educated for the Polish people, the Polish like -- supposed to be slaves. But the same time wa -- working -- was al- always belong to the underground army, until I was trained like a miner, and my specialist was the blowing the train. I-It was during the action what we did few times, it was action, the -- one day, the same day or the same time was to blow out the train in many places, that\u2019s [indecipherable] it was this organization, and I was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0074 \u00b0 trained, you know, the blowing the train. We trained [indecipherable] the trains would bring supply for that -- wou-would bring supply to the east front, or we blow the train, which was most important, they could [indecipherable] special train would bring the German soldier from the east front to vaca -- for vacation to Germany. There was th -- it was most difficult because this train has a very strong- very strong, you know, safety purpose. On the beginning, on the end of that train, there was a se -- se -- machines gun. Additional, this train has in the front of the machine gun, the locomotive, two cars who are loading with the -- with the sand, you know, to prevent the -- if they were blowing the -- preferred they would be blowing the empty -- the cars, not the -- not the locomotive. There was -- we find this, they will make a method that was special delayed, they will blow up not the empty train, but the train with the -- with the soldiers."
