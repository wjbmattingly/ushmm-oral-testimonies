To me, I was considered too young. I know what he did after the war, I know they were hidden with different families. One of them was in Broek in Waterland, would be with \u2014 would be Friese(ph) and Preym(ph) is the persons who they were hidden ith \u2014 with.

So, my dad had s \u2014 put money away during the war so he could get to it. And so there were \u2014 I do know they were captured once and they escaped. But otherwise, they had left me pretty well in the dark. The only think I knew, I was at \u2014 at the camps, I was picked up. I was with a nurse, picked up and taken to the camps. I found out a few years ago that I was part of a group of kids because at my age you feel, how did I survive the camp, you know, when you\u2019re two and a half years old? I found out I was with a group called unver kenter kinder in, where there\u2019s a whole memorial at the museum. There were 51 of us, almost all of us survived."

And when he got there, someone pointed to a sple \u2014 school buses, or buses, some type, and he pointed to which bus I would be on. So that is basically more than they used to tell me. Because they used to, you know, f\u2014a group of them got together, per se, my parents\u2019 friends, who also either hidden or camp survivors, and they used to discuss things. But I was basically never allowed into the group. I do know my mom has had nightmares. I didn\u2019t know how bad, that she basically had nightmare almost every night.
