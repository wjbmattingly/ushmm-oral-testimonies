But today | know it was true. So -- and do you know then in 1938, Hitler occupied the Sudatin (ph) line?

Anyhow, she sewed, knit woolen materials to friends and got a commission on that. And then she sent all her friends to certain coffee shop in the town. And there they had to say Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Doris Rauch 7 July 7, 1995 Page 7 that they were sent by my mother and she got a percentage from that. So my mother was very capable, although she never really worked. But she was very intelligent and very practical. And although there probably was some money, my father hadn't left anything because we just lived on his salary. But | think my mother inherited money from her mother. And | know she had stocks in the bank because | used to go with her to collect the coupons. But she always made an effort to earn some money herself."

And this woman came to us once a year, usually, and my mother went to visit her. And she smuggled out some money from Germany before they immigrated to Argentina. So we knew what was going on there. And then, also, Hitler occupied Austria in 1938 and one of my mother\u2019s brothers lived in Vienna. So they all immigrated first to Czechoslovakia to Berdenau (ph) before they attempted to get a visa to someplace else. And they did eventually go to France and from France to unoccupied France.

And my mother decided | should attend a Class in a Czech -- that\u2019s what it was. We were not admitted to German-speaking universities. Maybe still to Czech, | don\u2019t know. But | went to a Czech, you would call it maybe post-graduate textile school because Berdenau was full of textile factories. And the so-called English cloth that was so famous really came from Berdenau and was treated in England. You know, they had a special process they treated it with. But it was woven in Berdenau. So she send me to a textile school which did not interest me at all. | mean, we had to learn all about textile machinery and -- well, there was a possibility that perhaps | could become a designer.

We couldn't go into the street | think it was seven or eight o'clock in the evening. We had to stay at home. Then we were concentrated into certain streets of the city, which meant that my mother -- because we lived on such a street, we got, so to speak, renters into the apartment.
