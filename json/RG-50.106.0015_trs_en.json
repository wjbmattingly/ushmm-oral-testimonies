I Doris Rauch 6 July 7, 1995 Page 6 thought he was just bragging in front of me. But today I know it was true. So -- and do you know then in 1938, Hitler occupied the Sudatin (ph) line?

And I wore a Czech flag on my lapel in that year after Hitler really occupied the entire state and we had to wear a star instead of a flag.

And there they had to say Doris Rauch 7 July 7, 1995 Page 7 that they were sent by my mother and she got a percentage from that. So my mother was very capable, although she never really worked. But she was very intelligent and very prac tical. And although there probably was some money, my father hadn\u2122t left anything because we just lived on his salary. But I think my mother inherited money from her mother. And I know she had stocks in the bank because I used to go with her to collect the coupons.

And this woman came to us once a year, usually, and my mother went to visit her. And she smuggled out some money from Germany before they immigrated to Argentina. So we knew what was going on there. And then, also, Hitler occupied Austria in 1938 and one of my mother\u2122s brothers lived in Vienna. So they all immigrated first to Czechosl ovakia to Berdenau (ph) before they attempted to get a visa to someplace else. And they did eventually go to France and from France to unoccupied France.

And my mother decided I should attend a class in a Czech -- that\u2122s what it was. We were not admitted to German -speaking universities. Maybe still to Czech, I don\u2122t know. But I went to a Czech, you would call it maybe post -graduate textile school b ecause Berdenau was full of textile factories. And the so -called English cloth that was so famous really came from Berdenau and was treated in England. You know, they had a special process they treated it with. But it was woven in Berdenau. So she send me to a textile school which did not interest me at all. I mean, we had to learn all about textile machinery and -- well, there was a possibility that perhaps I could become a designer.

And they taught you exactly how much, what you can take. I think it was 50 kilos if I\u2122m not mistaken. And you were allowed to take blankets, you know, feather blankets. And a pail, I guess for washing the floor, but that\u2122s what we were allowed to. And I remember my mother packi ng for this trip and putting a whole little pail again of jam into that pail and covering it up with other things. And I was very upset about it. I thought they would catch her with that and we would be punished. It was very cowardly. But Doris Rauch 16 July 7, 1995 Page 16 fortunately, my m other wasn\u2122t and it was a very good thing that she brought the pail of jam.

It\u2122s my age; I can\u2122t think of what -- a pollster. He came and sewed for us something to cover those feather beds. We each had something -- it was a handle so that we could carry.

And we were in the barracks and were not allowed out. But there were some people who were allowed out, like the guard -- not guards. They were the ghetto policemen who watched over each barracks. And they could go to their administration I think. There were certain people who were allowed out. But I think June 1942, the Czechs still lived in their houses there. Then they were evacuated and then the ghetto was opened, you know. Then we could go out. But we left soon after that so I didn\u2122t experience that.

I don\u2122t know what -- they came into a different camp, but around there too because once, we were allowed to see them. So I left my hand luggage in the barrack, but I myself, stupid as I am, I went into the line where the other people stood in line to get into this one barrack. I had no idea what that was. And when my t urn came, it was pitch dark in the barrack. And there those SS men who made us undress and do all sorts of gymnastics. They went through what -- I probably had a purse, you know, and they found various things in there that they wanted to have. Took them ou t. Then we had to exercise so if we had anything in our vagina that it would fall out. And it was pretty awful, you know, to undress completely in front of those men. But there was nothing we could do. So then, when we got through, we just walked out -- got dressed and walked out and went into the barrack where I had left my luggage. You know, if I had just stayed there, I probably wouldn\u2122t have had to go through all that. But that\u2122s how naive I was. So then they unloaded all the luggage and put it in anoth er barrack. And then we lived in this barrack -- yeah, our families were not there. So we asked them, \ufb01You said we would meet our families here.\ufb02 And they said, \ufb01Well, we sent them to a camp that is heatable\ufb02 (It was September, you know.) \ufb01so they wouldn\u2122t freeze in winter.\ufb02"

She was the only one. And there were some girls there -- there were mostly young girls -- who cried terribly because they were separated from their Doris Rauch 31 July 7, 1995 Page 31 families. And most of us couldn\u2122t understand that. Why were they sent there and the camp had deceived them? We were going to see them again. So we lived for I don\u2122t know how many years, two years or more, thinking we would see our families again. We never heard about gassing or shooting. We had never heard about anything like that. So we spent our time unpacking the luggage. You know that it didn\u2122t occur to us, \ufb01How come -- what do the other people wear whose luggage it is?\ufb02 It didn\u2122t occur to -- or at least not to me. And of course, we had the advantage that if we found something we could use, we took it. But there was also from the luggage jewelry that we gave to the Germans, and money. You know I told you, in the dark barrack how he took things out of my pocketbook. For instance, I had -- it was a pencil, you know like an automatic pencil? But it was a much thicker pencil which my uncle had given me. He used it in his work as and architect. And he had given me that with rolled up money in there. They took it. So they must have known that people hide things. So then, you know, the clothes had to be sorted into, I don\u2122t know, dresses and shoes and whatever. And those SS people took them away by and by. But we found food there, too, so we cooked for ourselves, you know, we found alcohol stoves on which we could cook. And we just used them. And we found our own things, of co urse, which came in very handy later on because we exchanged them for food with the peasants and other people in Estonia so that we were not as starved as most people."

And so in the end, I said I\u2122d do it. That\u2122s how much of a leader I was. So we were there, back in the woods, and then they said we were going to Tallinn, which was Reval then. And we would work in making c lothes, you know, like a manufacturer of coats or dresses or whatever, which was an absolute lie. But that\u2122s what they said.

They started shav ing the heads and she finally convinced him he shouldn\u2122t do that. And so he stopped the whole thing. But to make a long story short, the two escaped together because word about what was going on got to Germany to his superiors and they sent another SS commander and before he even came, I think, they escaped together and hid in the woods.

Do you still Doris Rauch 51 July 7, 1995 Page 51 feel like it? In Hamburg, which was Hamburg Oxensal (ph), I became very sick immediately. I had pneumonia and I think I had typ hoid, but this is not for sure. Pneumonia and pleurisy and typhoid and a terrible diarrhea, probably enteritis or it may have been typhoid, I don\u2122t know. And after a month or so, they built a barrack which they called the ___________, where the sick people were sent. There were only, I think, six or seven of us in there. And I was there for what seems like months, but I don\u2122t know, really, how long it was. But I survived, which was a miracle in itself. And my best friend was at that time the Schreiberen (ph ) in this camp. She was in charge of counting people and she was the secretary to the SS man and so on. And she arranged for me not to have to go to the factory, but to be in the Schneiderstubben (ph) which was the place where they did sewing for the Germa ns. There were a lot of SS men and women there and there was a professional seamstress, also a Jewish lady, from Frankfurt. So that\u2122s where I ended up working. And then one day in April, they said that we would be sent -- that we are being sent to Sweden n ow. And we couldn\u2122t quite believe it, but they said it. So they put us on into cattle cars and we travelled and on the way we saw open cattle cars with dead people in there. And then they unloaded us in, I think it was called L\u00fcneburg, and from there, we w alked to Bergen -Belsen. So the thing with Sweden was not at all true. It was just another of those lies."

Well, fortunately, I didn\u2122t have to survive it there because three days later, the highest SS from Hamburg came back and said the factory needed people. And he started reading all our numbers. But since I had never worked in the factory, he didn\u2122t read my number, but not everyone was around, so when no one responded to a number, I went there because my two best friends were there."

Doris Rauch 58 July 7, 1995 Page 58 I was in psychotherapy for several years. And it was not easy. Every time a letter came from the lawyer in Germany, I thought, No, what now? What would he want now? But in the end of course, it\u2122s -- I could not live from the pension I get here. So that makes a big difference in my life and my lifestyle."

            "answer": "After the war, when we were first -- remember, I told you we were at _________. And then they sent us for recuperation to various plac es in Sweden. And my Czech friends and I were in a town called ________. And there one day -- there we didn\u2122t do anything, you know. They were just nice to us. And we went on hikes and had fun together and bicycles and so on. And one day, they had a sort o f a little feast for us where there came a couple of ministers -- I forget of what religion. And they lectured to us -- I forget about what. And afterwards, there was coffee and cake. There were maybe 30 or 40 of us in the scout hall where we were. And I j ust happened to sit next to one of those ministers and another friend -- the mixed one -- sat on the other side of him. And he asked me where we had been during the war and I told him about Estonia and so on. And he said, \ufb01Strange with Estonia, you know? I have a friend, and Estonian minister, who told me a terrible story about transport that came to Arazecu (ph). (I don\u2122t know whether he said Arazecu (ph)) that came and that some members of his congregation had to shoot those people. And that some of them Doris Rauch 59 July 7, 1995 Page 59 became quite emotionally sick from it.\ufb02 And from what he said -- of course, he didn\u2122t know the details -- I thought that could be us, you know? So he gave me the name and address of this minister. And it took me awhile. I didn\u2122t arrive right away or beware go to see him -- and I never did go to see him. I think I just didn\u2122t want to know really. But I did write him a letter and he wrote me a letter back saying such -and -such happened. That the people had to dig their own graves and were shot on the spot. And he wrote bad words. But he wrote very, you know, consolingly that maybe our families were not among those people because he remembers that there were some Jewish women seen in Reval working there. And maybe that\u2122s where my mother was. And so -- so of cour se, that was us. And so that was that. And then in 1960 -- I think in 1960 -- how did that come about? Well, I can\u2122t tell you the whole story. However, they caught some of those Estonian SS people and -- I mean I can tell you the story, but it would be too long -- and some of our friends who lived in Czechoslovakia -- went to Tallinn as witnesses in the trial of those people."

            "answer": "Yes. And two of them were hanged. And others were convicted in absentia. And one of them was the comm ander -- Laak was his name -- and he -- it turned out that he had immigrated. He had fled after the war to Canada. And the Russians were broadcasting -- there was news about the trial all the time -- and that they were looking for him. And he apparently go t frightened and he hanged himself in Canada. So one of our girls was living in Canada. And she -- when she read in the paper about it, she called the newspaper and said that she was one of his victims. And then the newspapers interviewed some others of ou r girls in New York. And one called me, Doris Rauch 60 July 7, 1995 Page 60 too. I was living in Chicago then. So you know, three of them, at least, are dead. And then -- while the girls were testifying, they took them to that place where it all had happened. And there is a monument there now. And it\u2122s not, apparently not only our transport, the German transport. They also killed some Russians, I think. So it -- on the monument, it was in all languages, I think. And so in 1992, we went there for the fiftieth anniversary of those times, of the day. And one of our friends who was also at the trial as a witness now lives in Switzerland. She escaped in 1968 with her husband. And she really built friendships there in Estonia, and they go there quite frequently to visit. And, you see, this woman, Eu genia __________ works for the Jewish community there. Yeah, this -- Eugenia _____ works for the Jewish community in Tallinn. And she worked on this book for years. She was already working on it in 1992. She found all the documents and it\u2122s all about the Estonian Jews and what happened to them."
