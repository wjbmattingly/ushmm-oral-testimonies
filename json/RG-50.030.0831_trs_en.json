            "question": "I am Leslie Swift , speaking on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , on September 20 th, in New York , and I am speaking to Benni Korzen . And I would just like to start by asking what can you remember \u0152 I know you were very young at the time that all of this happened. Can you tell me a little bit, if anything, that you remember from before the war?",
            "answer": "Sure. I was five, five and a half when, as a result of a very chao \u0152 chaotic and unplanned-for rescue operation, where people got together who had never been involved in saving anybody, decided to get together, save their Jewish neighbors. And so at \u0152 at five and a half years, oh you know, I \u0152 you\u2122re old enough to know what\u2122s going on, and I remember everything that I \u0152 the highlights. But let me just go back and \u0152 and also just explain that I was born in \u0152 in Denmark , and from ninet \u0152 from April \u0152 Denmark was occupied by Germany , April of 1940, and for three years, a little more than three years, for reasons that anybody whose \u0152 knows about history, the Germans pretty much left the population, including the Jewish population of Denmark , sort of alone. One reason was that the German war machine, you know, took advantage of the fact that in Denmark there was a huge production of butter and bacon and all ho \u0152 and stuff like that. So it made sense not to cause any trouble there. Then, something happened in August and September of Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 4 \u212243, as a result of which things changed. And essentially, orders came from Berlin to round up and arrest all \u0152 and, you know, remove all of the dangerous Jews, and bring them down to concentration camps. Anyway, the \u0152 what \u0152 what happened to me was, my parents, in those chaotic days, which were in October of 1943, not knowing exactly what would happen, they decided to place me with a non-Jewish family, a colleague of my father, they were both lawyers, and they fer \u0152 they thought that would be the safer thing to do. And as it turned out, it \u0152 you know, it \u0152 it worked out. I was there, and I stayed there for six to seven weeks, and then one night somebody came and picked me up and took me acor \u0152 you know, during the middle of the night, and I ended up on a boat, and was sailed across to Sweden , where my father had been nervously waiting for a few days. And we then ended up in Stockholm , and stayed there until May, 1945, when we then went back to Denmark . There are some details that \u0152 that \u0152 along the way that I think are important to nat \u0152 to \u0152 to know. What happened between 19 \u0152 April \u212240, and August, or so, 1943, was this relative calm. Then, the \u0152 basically Eichmann decided, and the order came from his office to, you know, not \u0152 no longer, you know, leave the Jews alone. What happened then factually, was that a low ranking \u0152 I think he was a trade attach\u00e9 at th e German embassy in Copenhagen , saw a telefax come in that wi-without any sp \u0152 you know, that \u0152 that gave him the information Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 5 that there was a \u0152 a Gestapo order now, to round up the Jews. He decided, without telling anybody, to tell a Danish friend, who \u0152 whom he knew was \u0152 wawas, you know, a person who \u0152 who would take that information. And that person took it to a high ranking politician, who went to the rabbi, and said, listen, this is about to happen. And the rabbi \u0152 and the rabbi said, I don\u2122t believe that. And there \u0152 th-the reason why he didn\u2122t believe that, was that the king, King Christian the tenth, had, from the time Denmark was occupied, given out many signals that all added up to, nobody touches anybody, because \u0152 as long as I\u2122m the king. And \u0152 and he would sort of demonstrate his attitude by when he took his morning ride, horse ride, through the streets of Copenhagen , whenever he was then saluted by German soldiers, he would simply turn his head away, ignoring them. And so, for three years \u0152 three and a half years, everybody felt that with the king in charge, nothing bad would happen. And that led to the rabbi\u2122s reaction. However, wi \u0152 faced with the very sh \u0152 harsh information, he then \u0152 the rabbi then changed his mind, and at a certain sermon \u0152 evening in the synagogue in Copenhagen , word came out and spread like \u0152 like i-i-instantly. The Jewish population at that time was a little under 8,000, and 90 percent or so, lived in Copenhagen . So it was a very easy way to \u0152 through \u0152 not through anything, other than word of mouth, for everybody to be reached. And that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s when this come \u0152 sort of chaotic and spontaneous \u0152 Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 6 well, it was spontaneous and \u0152 but also, surrounded by chaos, because nobody had done anything of this nature before. That a rescue operation that then took ple \u0152 the \u0152 the major numbers of people who \u0152 who were taken over, happened in October of 1943."

            "answer": "That did not take place until \u212263. What happened was, before that, in ni \u0152 in 1960, I star \u0152 as a young, you know, 22 year old kid, I went to wor \u0152 I \u0152 I started working f \u0152 at a movie company aa \u0152 as a \u0152 you know, a P.A, a production assistant. One day, arrived a crew of five people from CBS in New York . They came to Denmark in order to do a documentary about the rescue of the Danish Jews. And so I was attached \u0152 I \u0152 I spoke English, and I was attached to the m as their sort of show \u0152 their \u0152 their guide. And what happened was, we went around Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 12 and interviewed a number of the people who had been actively involved in the rescue operation. And a-at some point, we sat in the town of Elsinore, which is on the coast, five miles across the water from Sweden , at the office of a bookbinder, who \u0152 whose last name is Kerr (ph). And he spoke not a word of English, so I not only had to, you know, translate, but also sort of try to interpret what he was saying. And that \u0152 it was fine, it went on for 20 minutes, and the CBS writer got all the information he wanted, until suddenly Mr. Kerr (ph) turned to me and said in Danish, listen, I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m busy, I\u2122m a busy guy. Get these damn Americans out, I\u2122ve had enough of them. Which was a \u0152 which made it slightly tricky for me to translate, and I didn\u2122t quite know how to handle that. But I wa \u0152 I was sort of saved by the bell, because in walk \u0152 into his office walked another man and \u0152 and \u0152 who was clearly a \u0152 his, you know, assistant, or friend, whatever, because he was then introduced to all of us. And when it came to me, and \u0152 and he heard my last name, he said, wait a minute, I \u0152 I remember that. Then it turned out that wha \u0152 what unfolded was sort of a \u0152 a \u0152 wa-was as follows: it turned out that this man who came in, whose last name was Larsen (ph), had been the assistant of Kerr (ph) during the transportations, and what then ev \u0152 developed was that it was on Kerr \u2122s(ph) boat that I had been taken across. And he was the one who said, if you puke, you go overboard. And so, all of this happened within two minutes. And h \u0152 Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 13 and of course, Kerr (ph) changed his attitude, and we stayed and had beer and [indecipherable] and \u0152 and lunch, and stayed for hours. And then the next day, that story was then made part of the \u0152 of \u0152 of the documentary. And again, I was, because Kerr (ph) still didn\u2122t speak a word of English, I had to sort of tran \u0152 translate everything he said. He then \u0152 his story, as part of \u0152 of \u0152 of the people rescuing, you know, their Danish neighbors, Danish Jewish neighbors, was that he continued sailing across, even into 1943 - \u212244, the spring, in spite of the fact that it got increasingly difficult, because there were more and more patrols boats. And so it was only on nights without any moon that \u0152 that he could cross without being seen. And what did help his \u0152 his enterprise was that he went \u0152 he was sort of a \u0152 a Scarlet Pimpernel of \u0152 you know, he \u0152 he didn\u2122t pay much attention to his own safety. He \u0152 he \u0152 he went from a very small boat, to a f \u0152 pa \u0152 bigger boat, and by the time, in November of \u212243, he had a \u0152 as, under the circumstance, a very fast boat. And so, he managed to do this until he was caught and almost killed in 1944, and he spent a year in \u0152 in a concentration camp. He also, obviously, survived, because we had this wonderful lunch and thing in \u0152 in \u0152 in [indecipherable]"

            "answer": "I have a very clear memory of spending something like an hour on a fast moving boat, because what also happened was in October \u0152 in November of 1943, pretty much all the Jews had been crossed \u0152 ha-had crossed to Sweden , and so those \u0152 ththe transports then took care of \u0152 had people such as \u0152 on the boat it wa \u0152 it was a \u0152 an RAF pilot who had parachuted over Denmark , and he had to get \u0152 be gotten out. The Royal Air Force, you know, the British air force. And there were some other people. So, later on, while I was still six or seven, and we talked about th-the \u0152 the Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 17 crossing, I \u0152 I wi \u0152 my father said something, and I said, well, it was me and the other saboteurs that \u0152 that crossed th-the water. I \u0152 and because it was sort of a \u0152 a very \u0152 it was the first time I\u2122d bid \u0152 bid \u0152 been on a \u0152 on a boat of that type. It may have been the first time I\u2122d ee \u0152 been on a boat, ever. You know, as a five year \u0152 and a half year old boy, I was very excited about how it worked, and \u0152 and since, at that time, unlike before, during the really chaotic days in \u0152 in \u0152 in October, where ssometimes young children were a \u0152 you know, given sleeping pills, or whatever, to make sure that they would not make noise, this was different. And I guess th-the \u0152 Mr. Kerr (ph) took a chance. I guess he talked to me, and the way I responded made him believe that it was not necessary to \u0152 to, you know, give me an injection to \u0152 for \u0152 for me to keep quiet. So, by the time we arrived in \u0152 near Helsingborg in Sweden , which is across from the shortest distance from Denmark , I\u2122ve \u0152 as we moved into the harbor, along the \u0152 the side, I \u0152 I saw my father from the boat, and he was there with \u0152 I think with a policeman, nervously pacing back and forth. So that\u2122s what I do remember."

And then what Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 18 happened, I don\u2122t remember, but obviously what \u0152 what did happen was that we took a train, my father and I, to Stockholm , where we reunited with my mother."

            "answer": "Yeah. And one reason why, during the interview where I discover \u0152 where everybody discovered that the boat had \u0152 actually had me on board, what actually happened was that the man who walked in with a severe limp, because he\u2122d been injured during the war, where his fellow \u0152 Mr. Kerr (ph) was almost killed, when he was introduced to me, and remember the last name, which is somewhat unusual, there \u0152 the \u0152 the reason why he remembered that was that my father had, as a gift, made \u0152 given him a silver cigarette \u0152 he was a smoker \u0152 and had engraved in it, a thank you note from him, last name being Korzen .

Now, what we\u2122re witnessing these days, having to do with refugees, and \u0152 and immigration, and people trying to escape alive from either war, or related horrible \u0152 horrible to human situation, i-i-is \u0152 is the opposite. And it would be very nice if this example, which is not really that known, could be, let\u2122s say, elevated a-as the role model to \u0152 for everybody to \u0152 to \u0152 to imitate. How that is to be done, remains to be seen. Obviously, it \u0152 it would take \u0152 it would take a \u0152 an attitude that is the total opposite of what\u2122s happening right now. This is 19 \u0152 this is 2015, where, as we witness the debate about who we are, and what we should do, and what we should allow, the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 as I see it, the idiocy of doing the opposite of what this country is all based on. This country is based on having people come here, and then start a life that ends up making a country as good as it can be, because of the people. So there \u0152 so therefore the \u0152 whenever the opposite is being advocated, that to me sounds like it\u2122s based on idiocy, it\u2122s based on ignorance, and anything we can do to counteract that, wwe \u0152 we all have, I think, a responsibility to do.

            "answer": "The answer is no. The previous germ \u0152 our gran \u0152 my grandparents, were somewhat religious. They did not \u0152 they did celebrate the \u0152 the \u0152 the high holidays. I was Bar Mitzvahed when \u0152 13, as the \u0152 as the last of my sibling, and so we were, and still are, what you would call secular Jews. When our son turned 13, and we lived in New York at that time, we did not \u0152 what we did was, we sent him to be tutored by a Yiddish poet, who tutored kids, and dealt with everything Jewish, except for religion: history, music, culture, etcetera. And so, he got his \u0152 his upbringing in the same secular tradition. When my wife and I got \u0152 when I got married, which was in 1964, we went down to city hall in \u0152 in \u0152 in New York , but we really didn\u2122t like the AstroTurf floor, and \u0152 and couldn\u2122t see ourselves, sort of, doing the \u0152 the ceremony there. So we ended up, we lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan , and we ended up finding a rabbi in a synagogue, who was willing to marry us with the understanding that we were secular Jews. And so he \u0152 he promised to stay away from subject that had to do with \u0152 that would not really connect with being a secular Jew. And i \u0152 and the only thing he \u0152 a-and \u0152 and he said, so let\u2122s do it in my chambers, you know, not in the \u0152 in the big space, where Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 21 actually, I think the synagogue seats about 3,000 people. So, we came there with eight friends, and he changed his mind, he said no, let\u2122s go into the big space, even though we are only 12 people. And so, you know, be-be-because he wanted to demonstrate that he could deliver a \u0152 a sermon for people like us, and \u0152 and he \u0152 and I \u0152 I\u2122ve \u0152 he did. So, he managed to stay away from, you know, the word God. And yet, he \u0152 he did not violate his own, let\u2122s say background and principles of being a rabbi. He \u0152 he knew how to do \u0152 to \u0152 to have that \u0152 that balance. So my \u0152 the fact that I was \u0152 went through a Bar Mitzvah, I \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m happy and proud of it, even though the truth is that very shortly thereafter, I lost the ability to s \u0152 to speak whatever Hebrew I had learned. Which is what you need to understand, and \u0152 an -and you know, it\u2122s like, it just ended up in \u0152 in \u0152 in retrospect it\u2122s \u0152 it was a nice experience, it was a nice thing that happened."

It is, you know, people say Holocaust survivor, but it is a very diverse sort of set of circumstances. Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 22",
            "answer": "It\u2122s a very diverse \u0152 yes. One thing that happened very early on, after I settle in New York was my wife and I, we met a \u0152 a young girl our age, and for reasons that neither of us understood, we sort of \u0152 we became fast friends, and still are. This is now 50 years later. She happened to be \u0152 she\u2122s my age, and she was a \u0152 she is a survivor, but under much more dramatic osten \u0152 circumstances, in that she was saved by her grandmother, who was with her. And this was \u0152 she \u0152 she was born in Berlin, and under circumstances that cannot be described any other than miraculous, survived, and ended up in sw \u0152 in Sweden , in Stockholm . And by the time we met her in 1964 in New York , she had, like I, sort of gravitated from wherever, but \u0152 and had no longer \u0152 the fact that she was a German Jewish girl, had totally changed into, she was now a New Yorker . But \u0152 but her story, and her attitude, and her whole demeanor, clearly was something that, you know, it made an impression, and you know, th-the bond that \u0152 it\u2122s not that my story has much to do with hers, because mine is a happy end, and hers is a bittersweet, with a happy end.

            "answer": "No, growing up in Denmark , as \u0152 in Copenhagen as I did, the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the life that began after I came back in 1945, had \u0152 there was n-no anti-Semitism, or any other, let\u2122s say negative aspect of \u0152 of life. Denmark was then a society that had very few prejudices. The Danish \u0152 the Jewish community in Copenhagen , that had been there for a few hundred years, because in 16-something, the king of Denmark had invited a \u0152 a bunch of Jews from Germany or wherever, in sort of middle Europe , to settle, because he was an \u0152 an enterprising builder-type king, and he\u2122d heard that having Jews around would be helpful. And so, from that moment on, the Jewish community grew, and by the time we get to World War II, there were, in Danish culture, a huge impact of the Jewish artists and playwrights, and so on. One play that is always part of the repertory of the Royal Theater in Copenhagen , is written by a Jew, and \u0152 and deals with a Jewish holiday, and the reason for that. So, the au \u0152 so th-the \u0152 when I \u0152 un-until I left in 1964 and settled in New York , the \u0152 th-the \u0152 being Jewish in Denmark was almost somethi ng that people would boast of, or having a Jewish grandmother, etcetera. Things have changed because there have been at \u0152 b-both because of politics, and so on, a-and Interview with Benni Korzen September 18, 2015 24 because of Europe now is \u0152 is a different continent than it was then. So th-th-the wonderful \u0152 let\u2122s say the \u0152 the days of peace and prosperity and cultural exuberance that I re-relate to, when I was very young, that has changed, unfortunately, in the negative direction."
