            "question": "I am Leslie Swift, speaking on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, on September 20\", in New York, and I am speaking to Benni Korzen. And I would just like to start by asking what can you remember \u2014 I know you were very young at the time that all of this happened. Can you tell me a little bit, if anything, that you remember from before the war?",
            "answer": "Sure. I was five, five and a half when, as a result of a very chao \u2014 chaotic and unplanned-for rescue operation, where people got together who had never been involved in saving anybody, decided to get together, save their Jewish neighbors. And so at \u2014 at five and a half years, oh you know, I\u2014 you\u2019re old enough to know what\u2019s going on, and I remember everything that I \u2014 the highlights. But let me just go back and \u2014 and also just explain that I was born in \u2014 in Denmark, and from ninet \u2014 from April \u2014 Denmark was occupied by Germany, April of 1940, and for three years, a little more than three years, for reasons that anybody whose \u2014 knows about history, the Germans pretty much left the population, including the Jewish population of Denmark, sort of alone. One reason was that the German war machine, you know, took advantage of the fact that in Denmark there was a huge production of butter and bacon and all ho \u2014 and stuff like that. So it made sense not to cause any trouble there. Then, something happened in August and September of Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen i September 18, 2015 \u201943, as aresult of which things changed. And essentially, orders came from Berlin to round up and arrest all \u2014 and, you know, remove all of the dangerous Jews, and bring them down to concentration camps. Anyway, the \u2014 what \u2014 what happened to me was, my parents, in those chaotic days, which were in October of 1943, not knowing exactly what would happen, they decided to place me with a non-Jewish family, a colleague of my father, they were both lawyers, and they fer \u2014 they thought that would be the safer thing to do. And as it turned out, it \u2014 you know, it \u2014 it worked out. I was there, and I stayed there for six to seven weeks, and then one night somebody came and picked me up and took me acor \u2014 you know, during the middle of the night, and I ended up on a boat, and was sailed across to Sweden, where my father had been nervously waiting for a few days. And we then ended up in Stockholm, and stayed there until May, 1945, when we then went back to Denmark. There are some details that \u2014 that \u2014 along the way that I think are important to nat \u2014 to \u2014 to know. What happened between 19 \u2014 April \u201940, and August, or so, 1943, was this relative calm. Then, the \u2014 basically Eichmann decided, and the order came from his office to, you know, not \u2014 no longer, you know, leave the Jews alone. What happened then factually, was that a low ranking \u2014 I think he was a trade attach\u00e9 at the German embassy in Copenhagen, saw a telefax come in that wi-without any sp \u2014 you know, that \u2014 that gave him the information Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Benni Korzen \u00b0 September 18, 2015 that there was a \u2014 a Gestapo order now, to round up the Jews. He decided, without telling anybody, to tell a Danish friend, who \u2014 whom he knew was \u2014 wa-was, you know, a person who \u2014 who would take that information. And that person took it to a high ranking politician, who went to the rabbi, and said, listen, this is about to happen. And the rabbi \u2014 and the rabbi said, I don\u2019t believe that. And there \u2014 th-the reason why he didn\u2019t believe that, was that the king, King Christian the tenth, had, from the time Denmark was occupied, given out many signals that all added up to, nobody touches anybody, because \u2014 as long as I\u2019m the king. And \u2014 and he would sort of demonstrate his attitude by when he took his morning ride, horse ride, through the streets of Copenhagen, whenever he was then saluted by German soldiers, he would simply turn his head away, ignoring them. And so, for three years \u2014 three and a half years, everybody felt that with the king in charge, nothing bad would happen. And that led to the rabbi\u2019s reaction. However, wi \u2014 faced with the very sh \u2014 harsh information, he then \u2014 the rabbi then changed his mind, and at a certain sermon \u2014 evening in the synagogue in Copenhagen, word came out and spread like \u2014 like 1-1-instantly. The Jewish population at that time was a little under 8,000, and 90 percent or so, lived in Copenhagen. So it was a very easy way to \u2014 through \u2014 not through anything, other than word of mouth, for everybody to be reached. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s when this come \u2014 sort of chaotic and spontaneous \u2014 https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen \u00b0 September 18, 2015 well, it was spontaneous and \u2014 but also, surrounded by chaos, because nobody had done anything of this nature before. That a rescue operation that then took ple \u2014 the \u2014 the major numbers of people who \u2014 who were taken over, happened in October of 1943."

One day, arrived a crew of five people from CBS in New York. They came to Denmark in order to do a documentary about the rescue of the Danish Jews. And so I was attached \u2014 I\u2014 I spoke English, and I was attached to them as their sort of show \u2014 their \u2014 their guide. And what happened was, we went around https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen \" September 18, 2015 and interviewed a number of the people who had been actively involved in the rescue operation. And a-at some point, we sat in the town of Elsinore, which is on the coast, five miles across the water from Sweden, at the office of a bookbinder, who \u2014 whose last name is Kerr(ph). And he spoke not a word of English, so I not only had to, you know, translate, but also sort of try to interpret what he was saying. And that \u2014 it was fine, it went on for 20 minutes, and the CBS writer got all the information he wanted, until suddenly Mr. Kerr(ph) turned to me and said in Danish, listen, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m busy, I\u2019m a busy guy. Get these damn Americans out, I\u2019ve had enough of them. Which was a \u2014 which made it slightly tricky for me to translate, and I didn\u2019t quite know how to handle that. But I wa \u2014 I was sort of saved by the bell, because in walk \u2014 into his office walked another man and \u2014 and \u2014 who was Clearly a \u2014 his, you know, assistant, or friend, whatever, because he was then introduced to all of us. And when it came to me, and \u2014 and he heard my last name, he said, wait a minute, I \u2014 I remember that. Then it turned out that wha \u2014 what unfolded was sort of a \u2014 a\u2014 wa-was as follows: it turned out that this man who came in, whose last name was Larsen(ph), had been the assistant of Kerr(ph) during the transportations, and what then ev \u2014 developed was that it was on Kerr\u2019s(ph) boat that I had been taken across. And he was the one who said, if you puke, you go overboard. And so, all of this happened within two minutes. And h\u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen s September 18, 2015 and of course, Kerr(ph) changed his attitude, and we stayed and had beer and [indecipherable] and \u2014 and lunch, and stayed for hours. And then the next day, that story was then made part of the \u2014 of \u2014 of the documentary. And again, I was, because Kerr(ph) still didn\u2019t speak a word of English, I had to sort of tran \u2014 translate everything he said. He then \u2014 his story, as part of \u2014 of \u2014 of the people rescuing, you know, their Danish neighbors, Danish Jewish neighbors, was that he continued sailing across, even into 1943 - \u201944, the spring, in spite of the fact that it got increasingly difficult, because there were more and more patrols boats. And so it was only on nights without any moon that \u2014 that he could cross without being seen. And what did help his \u2014 his enterprise was that he went \u2014 he was sort of a\u2014a Scarlet Pimpernel of \u2014 you know, he \u2014 he didn\u2019t pay much attention to his own safety. He \u2014 he \u2014 he went from a very small boat, to a f\u2014 pa \u2014 bigger boat, and by the time, in November of \u00b043, he had a \u2014 as, under the circumstance, a very fast boat. And so, he managed to do this until he was caught and almost killed in 1944, and he spent a year in \u2014 in a concentration camp.

            "answer": "I have a very clear memory of spending something like an hour on a fast moving boat, because what also happened was in October \u2014 in November of 1943, pretty much all the Jews had been crossed \u2014 ha-had crossed to Sweden, and so those \u2014 th- the transports then took care of \u2014 had people such as \u2014 on the boat it wa \u2014 it was a \u2014 an RAF pilot who had parachuted over Denmark, and he had to get \u2014 be gotten out. The Royal Air Force, you know, the British air force. And there were some other people. So, later on, while I was still six or seven, and we talked about th-the \u2014 the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen am September 18, 2015 crossing, I \u2014 I wi\u2014 my father said something, and I said, well, it was me and the other saboteurs that \u2014 that crossed th-the water. I \u2014 and because it was sort of a\u2014a very \u2014 it was the first time I\u2019d bid \u2014 bid \u2014 been on a \u2014 on a boat of that type. It may have been the first time I\u2019d e-e \u2014 been on a boat, ever. You know, as a five year \u2014 and a half year old boy, I was very excited about how it worked, and \u2014 and since, at that time, unlike before, during the really chaotic days in \u2014 in \u2014 in October, where s- sometimes young children were a\u2014 you know, given sleeping pills, or whatever, to make sure that they would not make noise, this was different. And I guess th-the \u2014 Mr. Kerr(ph) took a chance. I guess he talked to me, and the way I responded made him believe that it was not necessary to \u2014 to, you know, give me an injection to \u2014 for \u2014 for me to keep quiet. So, by the time we arrived in \u2014 near Helsingborg in Sweden, which is across from the shortest distance from Denmark, I\u2019ve \u2014 as we moved into the harbor, along the \u2014 the side, I \u2014 I saw my father from the boat, and he was there with \u2014 I think with a policeman, nervously pacing back and forth. So that\u2019s what I do remember."

Now, what we\u2019re witnessing these days, having to do with refugees, and \u2014 and immigration, and people trying to escape alive from either war, or related horrible \u2014 horrible to human situation, 1-1-1s \u2014 is the opposite. And it would be very nice if this example, which is not really that known, could be, let\u2019s say, elevated a-as the role model to \u2014 for everybody to \u2014 to \u2014 to imitate. How that 1s to be done, remains to be seen. Obviously, it \u2014 it would take \u2014 1t would take a \u2014 an attitude that is the total opposite of what\u2019s happening right now. This is 19 \u2014 this is 2015, where, as we witness the debate about who we are, and what we should do, and what we should allow, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 as I see it, the idiocy of doing the opposite of what this country 1s all based on. This country is based on having people come here, and then start a life that ends up making a country as good as it can be, because of the people. So there \u2014 so therefore the \u2014 whenever the opposite is being advocated, that to me sounds like it\u2019s based on idiocy, it\u2019s based on ignorance, and anything we can do to counteract that, w-we \u2014 we all have, I think, a responsibility to do.

            "answer": "The answer is no. The previous germ \u2014 our gran \u2014 my grandparents, were somewhat religious. They did not \u2014 they did celebrate the \u2014 the \u2014 the high holidays. I was Bar Mitzvahed when \u2014 13, as the \u2014 as the last of my sibling, and so we were, and still are, what you would call secular Jews. When our son turned 13, and we lived in New York at that time, we did not \u2014 what we did was, we sent him to be tutored by a Yiddish poet, who tutored kids, and dealt with everything Jewish, except for religion: history, music, culture, etcetera. And so, he got his \u2014 his upbringing in the same secular tradition. When my wife and I got \u2014 when I got married, which was in 1964, we went down to city hall in \u2014 in \u2014 in New York, but we really didn\u2019t like the AstroTurf floor, and \u2014 and couldn\u2019t see ourselves, sort of, doing the \u2014 the ceremony there. So we ended up, we lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and we ended up finding a rabbi in a synagogue, who was willing to marry us with the understanding that we were secular Jews. And so he \u2014 he promised to stay away from subject that had to do with \u2014 that would not really connect with being a secular Jew. And 1\u2014 and the only thing he \u2014 a-and \u2014 and he said, so let\u2019s do it in my chambers, you know, not in the \u2014 in the big space, where Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen \u201c September 18, 2015 actually, I think the synagogue seats about 3,000 people. So, we came there with eight friends, and he changed his mind, he said no, let\u2019s go into the big space, even though we are only 12 people. And so, you know, be-be-because he wanted to demonstrate that he could deliver a \u2014 a sermon for people like us, and \u2014 and he \u2014 and I \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 he did. So, he managed to stay away from, you know, the word God. And yet, he \u2014 he did not violate his own, let\u2019s say background and principles of being a rabbi. He \u2014 he knew how to do \u2014 to \u2014 to have that \u2014 that balance. So my \u2014 the fact that I was \u2014 went through a Bar Mitzvah, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m happy and proud of it, even though the truth is that very shortly thereafter, I lost the ability to s \u2014 to speak whatever Hebrew I had learned. Which 1s what you need to understand, and \u2014 an-and you know, it\u2019s like, it just ended up in \u2014 1n \u2014 in retrospect it\u2019s \u2014 it was a nice experience, it was a nice thing that happened."

One thing that happened very early on, after I settle in New York was my wife and I, we met a\u2014 a young girl our age, and for reasons that neither of us understood, we sort of \u2014 we became fast friends, and still are.

            "answer": "No, growing up in Denmark, as \u2014 in Copenhagen as I did, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the life that began after I came back in 1945, had \u2014 there was n-no anti-Semitism, or any other, let\u2019s say negative aspect of \u2014 of life. Denmark was then a society that had very few prejudices. The Danish \u2014 the Jewish community in Copenhagen, that had been there for a few hundred years, because in 16-something, the king of Denmark had invited a \u2014 a bunch of Jews from Germany or wherever, in sort of middle Europe, to settle, because he was an \u2014 an enterprising builder-type king, and he\u2019d heard that having Jews around would be helpful. And so, from that moment on, the Jewish community grew, and by the time we get to World War II, there were, in Danish culture, a huge impact of the Jewish artists and playwrights, and so on. One play that is always part of the repertory of the Royal Theater in Copenhagen, is written by a Jew, and \u2014 and deals with a Jewish holiday, and the reason for that. So, the au \u2014 so th-the \u2014 when I \u2014 un-until I left in 1964 and settled in New York, the \u2014 th-the \u2014 being Jewish in Denmark was almost something that people would boast of, or having a Jewish grandmother, etcetera.
