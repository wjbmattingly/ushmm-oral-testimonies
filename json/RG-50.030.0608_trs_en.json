Mr. Gureckas, I just asked you about what was the year \u0152 what was the next half year between January and June 1940, what events took place, what things developed, but I thought of another question I wanted to ask, preceding that. And that is, of all these betrayals that we\u2122re talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government, what was left of it, betrayal by the, you know, small group of let\u2122s say refugees from tsarist Russia, who liked the idea of Russian domination, even if it was with their internal enemies before, betrayal by the Jewish community, or betrayal by Lithuanian \u0152 Gentile Lithuanians, ethnic Lithuanians, who were communists themselves. Which betrayal do you think you felt in your heart most keenly? Or maybe another betrayal?",
            "answer": "No, no. I think the Jewish, because several things. Russian community was so small that it was really insignificant. Our government, pretty \u0152 find out that there was a split of opinion about that, and there was b-betrayal in the high military command. So \u0152 also, you know , difficult. Now, Jewish, proble \u0152 problem is that \u0152 because maybe we were \u0152 or were \u0152 were mistaken, but we had the impression that the Lithuanian Jewish relations are very good. That there is no ispy \u0152 th-there was some Jewish communists, okay, you know \u0152 well, more than Lithuanian maybe, Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 122percentage-wise, but that was not rea lly significant. The Jewish community supported Lithuanians in the Vilnius question. They supported Lithuania\u2122s independence, they \u0152 Smetona had very good relations w ith the Jewish community\u2122s leaders, you know? So we didn\u2122t see the reason why \u0152 we, as I said, maybe they felt being discriminated, because it was difficult for them, you know, to \u0152 to \u0152 you know, to become officers in the army, in the police, and something like that. There was some ethnic discrimination in Lithuania . But those who really wanted could, you know, like Gensis(ph) was an officer in Lithuanian army, and very valued. So there \u0152"

He became officer in the Lithuanian military school, and had a very distinguished career in Lith uanian army, in the war with Poland. So, just one example, there were other officers, Jewish officers in Lithuanian army. But benda \u0152 generally, Lithuania being a small country, just esta blished, and in big tr \u0152 big conflict with Poland, and with Germany because of Klaipda, were looking \u0152 they Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 123were discriminating not according to religion or race or anything like that, but about the perceived loyalty to the state.

They were yus \u0152 universal peopl e, they \u0152 they were not \u0152 not that much ag-gainst Lithuania , but ri \u0152 but discounting Lithuania. And that also for having some \u0152 somebody like that in military or police would seem l-like risky, you know, h-h-he doesn\u2122t care about this country. So then, Germans. Lithuanian Germans ou-outside Klaipda were mostly loyal, very loyal, just like I told about that, you know, which I re-reme \u0152 remember in Taurag, Greigoris(ph), who \u0152 who refused even to \u0152 to go to Germany. And the same thing in Panev\u017eys , most of the Germans are loyal, but Germans still, you know, some. And then later, you know, there were Tartars and Karayims, there were no discrimination whatsoever. Their \u0152 their religion was different, Tartars were Muslim, Karayims had their own religion, Jewish based, you know. The race, you can s-see Karayim, you know, you could see from \u0152 from the face, from the features. Nim \u0152 Kara \u0152 Tartars not so much, was Karayims. But that didn't matter at all. Their people even in \u0152 in the army made the Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 124career, good career, you know. There were generals, Tartars, there were colonels, Karayims, you know. They were as good or better than Lithuanians, no \u0152 no problem. So, the base of discrimination was perceived loyalty of the mi-minority."

And Yi-Yiddish didn\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t bother anybody, Hebrew didn\u2122t bother anybody, but Russian, why Russian, you know? But \u0152 but \u0152 but I heard myself, I mean, f-father and son Jewish speaking in Lithuanian. So there were those who did that, you kn ow, and w-went to Lithuanian language. Even in this museum I saw a Jewish girl writing in ghetto her d \u0152 her diary in Lithuanian because she \u0152 she ju-just didn\u2122t know ji \u0152 Yiddish that well. So, there were \u0152 it was \u0152 it was a big community, it was varied situations, but generally, right or no \u0152 or not, but in the people there was a sense of betrayal beca use they thought that the relations were good, and they didn\u2122t see the reason why the Jewish community is acting that way, or much of the community, in particular the younger generation. The older generation, of course, didn\u2122t partici \u0152 participate in \u0152 in that, but as I said, they just \u0152 they just were in \u0152 behind the picture, yo u know. Nobody cared much about the \u0152 the Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 127rabbis or something like that, how \u0152 how they look at the things. Now, I also write in my memoirs that, one interesting thing that one of our \u0152 our family\u2122s friend was Dr. Bridges family, Dr. Bridges, Andrew Bridges was a doctor, you know, his specialty eyes, you know, and he had some Jewish friends, some Jewish also doctors. And during the Soviet occupation, the first year of \u0152 the first Soviet occupation, he-he was told by one of his friends, Jewish friends, that the Jewish community leaders from the independence period, were concerned about this reaction of the younger generation, and they called some of the active \u0152 well, pro \u0152 pro-communist, younger, active people and ta lked with them, and asked them not \u0152 not to overdo things, that it is dangerous, that the Jewish community, living hundreds of times bet-between other nationalities, tried not to become hostile to the people they are living between. Tried to be neut ral, you know, and th -th-they e \u0152 taking sides, they couldn\u2122t have survived, beca use they would also, you know, provoke a lot of hostility. And they asked those younger generation Jews to tone down, to tone down. And they said the younger \u0152 the you ng people just lef \u0152 la \u0152 just laughed at them. The old people they don\u2122t understand anything, and their rules, I mean, are ob-obsolete and \u0152 and didn't want even to lis ten to them. So apparently even in the Jewish community, there was some perception that somebody is o-overdoing the things. Now, was \u0152 as I say, you know, those who were against this reaction, you know, they we \u0152 they were \u0152 they were i-in \u0152 invisible, they tried to be-become Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 128invisible. Now you asking about the peri od from \u0152 in early 1940s. Really the breakthrough was the annexation earlier, in 194 0, August, I think the third or fifth, about that time. Right after the annexation, the thing changed. Now the terror intensified consid \u0152 considerably, and the resistance started getting organized. So now, la \u0152 a lot of people, even in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in my class, like Grimkas(ph) and Ar-Arbuk(ph) were arrested from resistance. But even the [indecipherable] resistance, the people who were prominent in the \u0152 in the society generally, most of them were arrested, th-thousands now. Now it became a mass thing. Now there was nationa \u0152 nationalization; the business es tablishments, commercial establishments, industrial things were nationalized. I was my-myself, we \u0152 we s-students had to go there, write, you know, in the \u0152 whatever belongs to that merchant establishment, and to be nationalized with the owners. Now, somehow you know, the Lithuanian owner who owns some business or \u0152 or \u0152 or \u0152 or business establishment, they \u0152 they were just thrown out. Now the Jewish, usually you know, still remain there as a specialist. Just because usually there were some in the family, or in \u0152 in their circle who had influence with the new government. So apparently they tried, you know, to help each other. And pretty ba \u0152 became pretty obvious, you know, the things are nationalized, the Jews are still in their places, running the business as before. Of course now, in government\u2122s name, for \u0152 in government\u2122s account, Lithuanians are just without a job, you know, just \u0152 ju st waiting around. What\u2122s the matter, you Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 129know, it\u2122s always the \u0152 these \u0152 these things started accumulating. The resentment against the Jewish reaction increased strongly. As the terror increased, increased the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the reaction. Also, because some of them, you know, even communist Jews went into the security e-e-establishment."

I don\u2122t know what \u0152 whether all of them, of course, maybe o-ob \u0152 obviously, there should have been people who approved. Af-After all, there were people who participated. But generally, you know, when you go to the city and see the people, you \u0152 you can see that ever ybody\u2122s kind of like paralyzed from horror, what\u2122s going on. You ga \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 any revenge, anything about the Jews was Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 181forgotten by that time, long ago. When the Jews were brought into the ghetto, you know, the Lithuanians, th-that \u0152 that was the end. The Lithuanians didn\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t approve of that; a ghetto as it was established there, didn\u2122t approve of that, and so \u0152 but yeah, that\u2122s \u0152 that is a terrible, a terrible thing. Yeah, we \u0152 we went then, after the execution, oh several, several weeks after the execution, and we went to a farm where one of our friends had the girlfriend iin that farm. The farm was nearest farm to the execution place. And we wanted to find out. We \u0152 we knew, I mean, it \u0152 it was a horrible thing happened of a gur \u0152 trem endous significance. Wanted to find out wa-wa \u0152 wh-what \u0152 what it was. And they said well, the girl couldn\u2122t tell us anything because when the executioner cames, the fa \u0152 th-the \u0152 the parents, they say, hid her. Told her to go upstairs, yo u know, and the \u0152 and to hi de, and because those \u0152 the killers were going around the co \u0152 the house drinking water, vodka, everything. But we didn\u2122t really, in such a detail as this from Bir\u017eai told, there was nothing \u0152 nothing \u0152 nothing. The same thing, the same Germans and Lithuanians. German officer also killing, you know, babies. Apparently still there\u2122s some resistance of the executioners to kill babies, so the officer had to take them up on himself. I\u2122m just \u0152 I suppose, that \u0152 that\u2122s my deduction. The story was told that, you know, one Lithuanian officer was married to a j \u0152 Jewish girl, and when the Jews were brought to the ghetto, he went together with her. Lived together with her, and when they Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 182brought to the execution, he went together with her. And he was told, you know, to go out \u0152 go away, you know. He refused, he went with his wife and was killed there."

So, Germans also realized that they are in bad shape now.

So I w \u0152 I volunteered for that, not wanting to go anywhere else. My resistance leader approved of that."
