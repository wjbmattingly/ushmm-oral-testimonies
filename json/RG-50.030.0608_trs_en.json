Mr. Gureckas, I just asked you about what was the year \u2014 what was the next half year between January and June 1940, what events took place, what things developed, but I thought of another question I wanted to ask, preceding that. And that 1s, of all these betrayals that we\u2019re talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government, what was left of it, betrayal by the, you know, small group of let\u2019s say refugees from tsarist Russia, who liked the idea of Russian domination, even if it was with their internal enemies before, betrayal by the Jewish community, or betrayal by Lithuanian \u2014 Gentile Lithuanians, ethnic Lithuanians, who were communists themselves. Which betrayal do you think you felt in your heart most keenly? Or maybe another betrayal?",
            "answer": "No, no. I think the Jewish, because several things. Russian community was so small that it was really insignificant. Our government, pretty \u2014 find out that there was a split of opinion about that, and there was b-betrayal in the high military command. So \u2014 also, you know, difficult. Now, Jewish, proble \u2014 problem is that \u2014 because maybe we were \u2014 or were \u2014 were mistaken, but we had the impression that the Lithuanian Jewish relations are very good. That there is no ispy \u2014 th-there was some Jewish communists, okay, you know \u2014 well, more than Lithuanian maybe, 122 Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 percentage-wise, but that was not really significant. The Jewish community supported Lithuanians in the Vilnius question. They supported Lithuania\u2019s independence, they \u2014 Smetona had very good relations with the Jewish community\u2019s leaders, you know? So we didn\u2019t see the reason why \u2014 we, as I said, maybe they felt being discriminated, because it was difficult for them, you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 you know, to become officers in the army, in the police, and something like that. There was some ethnic discrimination in Lithuania. But those who really wanted could, you know, like Gensis(ph) was an officer in Lithuanian army, and very valued. So there"

But benda \u2014 generally, Lithuania being a small country, just established, and in big tr \u2014 big conflict with Poland, and with Germany because of Klaip\u00e9da, were looking \u2014 they 123 Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 were discriminating not according to religion or race or anything like that, but about the perceived loyalty to the state.

They were yus \u2014 universal people, they \u2014 they were not \u2014 not that much ag-gainst Lithuania, but ri \u2014 but discounting Lithuania. And that also for having some \u2014 somebody like that in military or police would seem I-like risky, you know, h-h-he doesn\u2019t care about this country. So then, Germans. Lithuanian Germans ou-outside Klaip\u00e9da were mostly loyal, very loyal, just like I told about that, you know, which I re-reme \u2014 remember in Taurag\u00e9, Greigoris(ph), who \u2014 who refused even to \u2014 to go to Germany. And the same thing in Panev\u00e9zys, most of the Germans are loyal, but Germans still, you know, some. And then later, you know, there were Tartars and Karayims, there were no discrimination whatsoever. Their \u2014 their religion was different, Tartars were Muslim, Karayims had their own religion, Jewish based, you know. The race, you can s-see Karayim, you know, you could see from \u2014 from the face, from the features. Nim \u2014 Kara \u2014 Tartars not so much, was Karayims. But that didn't matter at all. Their people even in \u2014 in the army made the 124 Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 career, good career, you know. There were generals, Tartars, there were colonels, Karayims, you know. They were as good or better than Lithuanians, no \u2014 no problem. So, the base of discrimination was perceived loyalty of the mi-minority."

And Y1-Yiddish didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t bother anybody, Hebrew didn\u2019t bother anybody, but Russian, why Russian, you know? But \u2014 but \u2014 but I heard myself, I mean, f-father and son Jewish speaking in Lithuanian. So there were those who did that, you know, and w-went to Lithuanian language. Even in this museum I saw a Jewish girl writing in ghetto her d \u2014 her diary in Lithuanian because she \u2014 she ju-just didn\u2019t know ji \u2014 Yiddish that well. So, there were \u2014 it was \u2014 1t was a big community, it was varied situations, but generally, right or no \u2014 or not, but in the people there was a sense of betrayal because they thought that the relations were good, and they didn\u2019t see the reason why the Jewish community is acting that way, or much of the community, in particular the younger generation. The older generation, of course, didn\u2019t partici \u2014 participate in \u2014 in that, but as I said, they just \u2014 they just were in \u2014 behind the picture, you know. Nobody cared much about the \u2014 the 127 Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 rabbis or something like that, how \u2014 how they look at the things. Now, I also write in my memoirs that, one interesting thing that one of our \u2014 our family\u2019s friend was Dr. Bridges family, Dr. Bridges, Andrew Bridges was a doctor, you know, his specialty eyes, you know, and he had some Jewish friends, some Jewish also doctors. And during the Soviet occupation, the first year of \u2014 the first Soviet occupation, he-he was told by one of his friends, Jewish friends, that the Jewish community leaders from the independence period, were concerned about this reaction of the younger generation, and they called some of the active \u2014 well, pro \u2014 pro-communist, younger, active people and talked with them, and asked them not \u2014 not to overdo things, that it is dangerous, that the Jewish community, living hundreds of times bet-between other nationalities, tried not to become hostile to the people they are living between. Tried to be neutral, you know, and th-th-they e \u2014 taking sides, they couldn\u2019t have survived, because they would also, you know, provoke a lot of hostility. And they asked those younger generation Jews to tone down, to tone down. And they said the younger \u2014 the young people just lef \u2014 la \u2014 just laughed at them. The old people they don\u2019t understand anything, and their rules, I mean, are ob- obsolete and \u2014 and didn't want even to listen to them. So apparently even in the Jewish community, there was some perception that somebody is o-overdoing the things. Now, was \u2014 as I say, you know, those who were against this reaction, you know, they we \u2014 they were \u2014 they were 1-in \u2014 invisible, they tried to be-become 128 Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 invisible. Now you asking about the period from \u2014 in early 1940s. Really the breakthrough was the annexation earlier, in 1940, August, I think the third or fifth, about that time. Right after the annexation, the thing changed. Now the terror intensified consid \u2014 considerably, and the resistance started getting organized. So now, la \u2014 a lot of people, even in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in my class, like Grimkas(ph) and Ar-Arbuk(ph) were arrested from resistance. But even the [indecipherable] resistance, the people who were prominent in the \u2014 in the society generally, most of them were arrested, th-thousands now. Now it became a mass thing. Now there was nationa \u2014 nationalization; the business establishments, commercial establishments, industrial things were nationalized. I was my-myself, we \u2014 we s-students had to go there, write, you know, in the \u2014 whatever belongs to that merchant establishment, and to be nationalized with the owners. Now, somehow you know, the Lithuanian owner who owns some business or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or business establishment, they \u2014 they were just thrown out. Now the Jewish, usually you know, still remain there as a specialist. Just because usually there were some in the family, or in \u2014 1n their circle who had influence with the new government. So apparently they tried, you know, to help each other. And pretty ba \u2014 became pretty obvious, you know, the things are nationalized, the Jews are still in their places, running the business as before. Of course now, in government\u2019s name, for \u2014 in government\u2019s account, Lithuanians are just without a job, you know, just \u2014 just waiting around. What\u2019s the matter, you 129 Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 know, it\u2019s always the \u2014 these \u2014 these things started accumulating. The resentment against the Jewish reaction increased strongly. As the terror increased, increased the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the reaction. Also, because some of them, you know, even communist Jews went into the security e-e-establishment."

But generally, you know, when you go to the city and see the people, you \u2014 you can see that everybody\u2019s kind of like paralyzed from horror, what\u2019s going on. You ga \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 any revenge, anything about the Jews was Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 forgotten by that time, long ago. When the Jews were brought into the ghetto, you know, the Lithuanians, th-that \u2014 that was the end. The Lithuanians didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t approve of that; a ghetto as it was established there, didn\u2019t approve of that, and so \u2014 but yeah, that\u2019s \u2014 that is a terrible, a terrible thing. Yeah, we \u2014 we went then, after the execution, oh several, several weeks after the execution, and we went to a farm where one of our friends had the girlfriend 1-in that farm. The farm was nearest farm to the execution place. And we wanted to find out. We \u2014 we knew, I mean, it \u2014 it was a horrible thing happened of a gur \u2014 tremendous significance. Wanted to find out wa-wa \u2014 wh-what \u2014 what it was. And they said well, the girl couldn\u2019t tell us anything because when the executioner cames, the fa \u2014 th-the \u2014 the parents, they say, hid her. Told her to go upstairs, you know, and the \u2014 and to hide, and because those \u2014 the killers were going around the co \u2014 the house drinking water, vodka, everything. But we didn\u2019t really, in such a detail as this from BirZai told, there was nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 nothing. The same thing, the same Germans and Lithuanians. German officer also killing, you know, babies. Apparently still there\u2019s some resistance of the executioners to kill babies, so the officer had to take them up on himself. I\u2019m just \u2014 I suppose, that \u2014 that\u2019s my deduction. The story was told that, you know, one Lithuanian officer was married to a j \u2014 Jewish girl, and when the Jews were brought to the ghetto, he went together with her. Lived together with her, and when they 182 Interview with Algimantas Gureckas October 14, 2010 brought to the execution, he went together with her. And he was told, you know, to go out \u2014 go away, you know. He refused, he went with his wife and was killed there."

Estonian [indecipherable] legion, and Latvian, two divisions. Estonian, one division, Latvian, two divisions. And Lithuanian, Lithuanians just boycotted. Nobody really, excepts few invalids reported to the induction center. Well, they became so angry, they closed the universities, because they realized that the students were behind it, and they arrested the \u2014 you know, s \u2014 I don\u2019t know, about 50, maybe less people very known in Lithuania.

So I thought that the only thing I have, if I don\u2019t want, you know, that my family will suffer [indecipherable] for that, I \u2014 I would rather collec \u2014 select, you know, where do I am going under the Germans. And I selected so-called Reichsarbeitsdienst. A Reichs labor service, which all the Germans had to \u2014 to go through before going into the military service, but also the girls had to go through that. So I w \u2014I volunteered for that, not wanting to go anywhere else. My resistance leader approved of that."
