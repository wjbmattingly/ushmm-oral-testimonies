He started anot her Czech opera, and then when German Jews came, and these were -- the German Jews they were not -- there were very few young people, very few. Very few young middl e class, these were older, upper middle class, and then the -- the prominent ones, the old ones who fought in World War I, with whom the German played a cruel game. They promised them -- or told them, leave everything here, your furniture, your money, your belongings, the -- the glass in the showcase. We are bringing you to a spa wh ere you will have no worry. You will have maid service, and room service, and food service, and laundry service. And these guys, after observing three or four or five years, how the Germans treat -- how the Nazis treated the German Jews in Germany, still believed the officer\u2122s word. The -- the reason that they came, at a time when the ba rracks, and the houses of the town population were already filled, and the only place for them was in the attics of the barracks. They will put straw mattresses on the floor, and you can imagine the old people going down to the floor to lay down to sleep, and even worse to get up to sleep. And if you have heard about it, older people have to go to the bathroom more ofte n. So first to get up, and then climb over -- I guess these mattresses were one next to the other, to accommodate as many as possible, climb over the people with a dim light, because the light was dim so the rest can sleep. 64 And go down a flight of stairs, and then still the bathroom was not next to the stairs, still go on. And if they couldn\u2122t hold it, I don\u2122t have to describe you the hygienic and sanitary conditions that have developed, which contributed to the acce -- accelerated death rate. And also, many of them lost will to live . They were de -- they were deceived, heartbroken by the German officers and -- to whom they had so much trust. And so many suicides among them, among the old people. A nd then, as I said, quick deterioration through lack of sanitation and -- and cleanliness, and that was a very poor sight. But Schacter immediately took his Czech Jews, and started to study \ufb01Marri age of Figaro,\ufb02 for the same purpose, to pep up that -- those Ge rman prisoners. And \ufb01Magic Flute,\ufb02 and the Czech singers were s -- most of the Czechs spoke German, because not only at the -- at the border area, but most Czechs had frequent use for the German language. So German was pretty used among the Czech Jews."

            "answer": "How did it come about? Now there is a -- a saying going around, and you must have heard it, that the Germans picked Theresienstadt as a town to show off with. It wasn\u2122t that way. I mentioned it among other things in thei r hometown, they had to turn in their musical instruments, and some didn\u2122t. And some even had the chutzpah, people who will read this may know what that means, had th e guts to bring those ins -- smuggle those 65 instruments with i -- within those 110 pounds , instead of food and clothing, into Terez\u00edn, because they were so -- such ardent musician s, amateurs and professionals, who loved to play, and because everybody thought it\u2122s going to be over in six months. I spoke about the optimism. When the six months were over, they gave themselves another six months. So they played in attics, and in cellars, to stay in shape for when they come out, they should be in the same performance level as they came in. And although there are no -- were no Germans in the ghetto, nothing escaped them, they found out. And now a terrific fright and concern gripped everyone in the ghetto, because the Germans -- a few Germans kept all these thousands of Jews in check by imposing corrective punishment. So what that means, were two kinds, either right away into the transport, with -- and these people were marked, when they were in the transport, in Auschwitz they know who they are, and they select them -- direct them to the appropriate side, punishing side, or the small fortress. So nobody wanted to involve thei r wife, parents, children, siblings in such a punishment, so there was a big concern. The head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein told the camp commander why -- I mean, not in this exact wording, I\u2122m paraphrasing, why would you punish these few people? Look at the amount of talent you have accumulated here, why don\u2122t you think of a progr am where you can utilize them to show the world how well you treat the Jews? That\u2122s when this idea came into being. It was not a preconceived idea with the Germans before the ghetto was created. So not only were these Jews not punished, and could retain their instruments, more instruments were brought in from Prague, and before they dete rmined how they are going to do -- show the world how well they treat the Jews, they already divide -- devised a beautification program in anticipation of that, and a free tim e activities department was created. And in the frame of this orchestras -- jazz has just come to -- to Europe from United States, so we had a five member -- what is it called? Ghetto swingers. Ghetto swingers jazz team. Then there were the two musicians who played in the caf\u00e9. One of them was my cousin, the accordionist, he was a piano and accor -- but there he played the accordion, and one was a violinist. And -- and other of the quartets, and unbelievable, not the Germans, and not the Council of Elders could have imagin ed what\u2122s getting news there. And not only music, there were theaters -- there were all the actors from -- from all these towns. The theater, cabaret, those are very popular because they were throwing these verbal darts at the Germans, in Czech language. Maybe some even in German, I don\u2122t know about those. And this was very uplifting, and very helping in -- in really reducing the anxieties of the life that was destined for us. There were lectures. There were 1240 lectures on different subjects. This is based on the notes from that -- that they found from that free activity -- free time activity list, by prof essors, chemists, biologists, rabbis. Nobody went to the temple, but they went there to listen to th e rabbi. And people who had no interest in chemistry and so, went to j -- just to get di versification, and -- and getting away from -- from this dread life of ghetto. By the way, th ey called -- you know, Terez\u00edn in German is Theresienstadt, and the Nazis told these prominent people they go to Theresienbath, which is a Theresien spa. I didn\u2122t say it when we were on the subject. So it is an unbe -- there was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in New York or -- or anywhere else, in a day. And people after work went, and they -- they shortened their sleeping time, because they were not really st rong with the -- with the food they were getting, and I don\u2122t take blame for it. I just did what was -- we had. But it was -- it was unbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew like mushrooms after the rain. 66"

It wasn\u2122t difficult for me to fall asleep until I\u2122ve been awakened with a -- a rifle butt by an SS ma n. I think the -- the -- my meister must have told the guard that his helper is missing. So he found me. I\u2122m glad I\u2122m not bald because I have a very ugly prot rusion still, on my head. And so he kicked me in the behind and sent me back to work. I was lucky he didn\u2122t deport me. So I did my work again, you know, you get this kind of encouragement with a boot, you continue to work. One day after the shift, we go back to camp, there was a snow on the floor -- on the ground. And I had wooden shoes, those Dutch wooden clogs, that was the only shoes that fitted me, that I got exchange. They were good -- a good and the bad side. The good was 108 it insulated from the cold of the ground, but uncomfortable because they were not flexible. Walking back to the camp, I see ahead of me a huge -- only maybe it just seemed that -- that huge to me, onion on the edge -- on the side of the road. So I look back where the guard is, and told the guy behind me, step a little bit out of formation, cover me. And I bent down, and picked it up an d put it in the jacket to take it to camp, because whatever either one of the three of us found, stole, or otherwise, we shared. So I took it in to share it with them. And we were brought in a nd lined up on the roll call area for frisking. We were frisked on -- infreque -- not infrequently like little, but unannounced because we were working with tools, and we could have made some weapon, a knife, or -- or something which the Germans did not like very much. So what do I do with the onion? If I throw it aw ay and don\u2122t say it was me, everybody gets punished, the old theme of collective punishment. If I say it was me, they beat me to a pulp because they won\u2122t believe I found it, they will think I stole -- they will insist I stole it. Only one way out, to eat the onion, quickly. This is with the peel and with those little roots on it. The eyes were -- tears were coming down my cheeks, and the nose was running, and sweat in that cold, wintry day, sweat was coming up on my forehead. And when he ca -- I finished it before he came to me, and I didn\u2122t dare to breathe while he was frisking me.

But early in the morning on th e third day I felt -- I -- I will be one of those shot on the road. I am weak, tired, tough trying to drag my feet. And the kids were in -- in fairly good shape, because I mentione d the smaller ones and skinny one tolerated it better. So I said, if I stay here, I get shot . I try to escape. Whatever chance I have, I will take it. If it\u2122s 10 percent, I\u2122ll take 10 percent of success to escape. And so I told them, stay together and help each other if you need to, and I can\u2122t any more, and I have no use to you anyway. So we come to a forest, tall forest on both sides of the road, no moon, real 111 dark. So that was the moment. I slipped to -- in to the ditch on the side of the road. I don\u2122t know why I didn\u2122t encourage the kids to do it too, but I felt I don\u2122t want to be responsible in case -- you know, to suggest something wher e they may suffer. And I laid down in the snow, face down. And there was -- must have been a zealous guard who shot me. And whether it was the dark, or whether it was frozen fingers, I don\u2122t know. He shot me under the arm, and the bullet got stuck in the rib. And the snow -- the -- the blood was color -- starting to color the snow, and that wa s good, because nobody else attempted a second shot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly had strength to pick myself up, and went into the forest, and found like minded people, other prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot. So we huddled together and used the blanket in ma -- outside in -- in Ja nuary in the forest with this -- just a cotton uniform, and I think we all sl ept, sitting, holding each other. And in the morning we went to the edge of the forest, that the road we came from, looking whether we find a sign where we are, what\u2122s happening. And we see the top of the hill another camp. The gate is open, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners walking in and out. So inside the forest we ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, we could run, near to that camp, and we asked one of the prisoners, \ufb01Well what -- well what is this?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I don\u2122t know, but before dawn, all the Germans jumped into ca r -- into the trucks and took off.\ufb02 Didn\u2122t even take the time to liquida te the camp, with machine guns, and -- and hand grenades. So what really happened, in that area, a Russian tank force cut a wedge into the German front. And of course they didn\u2122t want to be caught by the Russians, so they jumped in the trucks and left in a hurry. We -- I went into the camp, and saw guys from our camp. I said, \ufb01Where were you located?\ufb02 Sort of the la st block, because that was the last group that arrived there. And I found the two kids th ere, and we started to look for food, but we didn\u2122t find any, because those who were ther e already, they plundered the -- the -- the potato storage, and all -- all other storages. But somebody told us there\u2122s, on the side the road, is a abandoned village where the German population ran the same way as the SS, and there\u2122s food in their pantries. So we went there, not far, and there\u2122s food. Everything except bread. They must have taken the loaf and bread and ran. The speed at which they ran wa -- showed itself. That was unfinished food, even unfinished food on the table, and the rest was burned in the oven, or on top of the range. So we had food, and there was no -- at that time there was no refrigeration in Europe [indecipherable] I don\u2122t know, a few people may have had a refrigerator , and -- we want to break --"

People were -- had all kinds of preservation methods of food without refrigerator. So the first thing I found was a -- like a gallon jug glass jar, with roasted pork, covered with rendered lard, which prevents the -- the oxygen reaching the meat, and the meat therefore, does not s poil. And after months of Auschwitz diet, and three days absolutely nothing, I dug into that lard, and ate it like that. No bread, no nothing. And I still don\u2122t understand that this didn\u2122t kill me faster than -- than the 113 Auschwitz diet. But it had a effec -- had it\u2122s effects. This was a huge place, the -- that camp was called Blechhammer, and it was pa rt of a huge industrial complex. All the camp inmates were working in it -- of for ced laborers from occupied countries were there, and POW\u2122s were also there, and we re working. We found the camp of the British prisoners of war, and for some reason -- they were bombing London, but for some reason they were treating the British POW\u2122s very we ll. We found in that barrack warm uniforms, boots, socks, scarves, caps, coats, and a lot of toilet paper, which saved us from result of the way we were eating. There were 10 of us in -- in one of those barracks, there were two toilets, one on each end, and that wasn\u2122t enough. So they brought from the village, I don\u2122t know, somewhere, a huge half barrel, li ke a big whiskey barrel. I put two boards across so four could sit at the same time. Th at bad it was. I started to improvise cooking, and one guy was helping me, and eight did -- the rest of the 10, the eight went to town to bring supplies. The one kid I mentioned was working the carpentry shop in Terez\u00edn, he made a sled so more stuff could be brought. And there\u2122s one point he brought the whole -- took out from one of those houses a kitchen st ove, including the pipes. He installed it, and then we were really cooking. The Russian soldiers came to eat, to us, because they didn\u2122t get food like that. It was another comp liment for the aunt. And we\u2122re cooking till 10 in the evening, and by 10:15, there wasn\u2122t a bite to be had. That\u2122s how we ate. No -- no control. And the Russian soldiers told us how wonderful Communism is, everybody is even, and it\u2122s the best system, until a Jewish officer came, a Russian Jewish officer, said, \ufb01Don\u2122t believe a word.\ufb02 We were thinking of Communism, because that\u2122s a -- was presented to us as a real equal society, a society of equal people. But he set us straight. We were six weeks in that British barracks, because between wh ere we were, and our home, they were still fighting. You know, from the east front, we were here, and Prague was here, and the Russians were only getting there. So for six weeks we suffered terrible diarrhea. And in spite of it, I gained 79 pounds within six weeks, with my own cooking. I said -- what\u2122s her name, I fi -- know this -- this diet advertiser, Jenny Craig would have gone crazy if she heard that somebody gain ed 79 pounds in six weeks. And everybody -- after six weeks we moved out of there, and went to Katowice -- here come friend of the spelling. And they put us up in the schoolhouse where or -- other -- other form of prisoners were. And the Polish Red Cross gave us identification papers based on what we told them, because we didn\u2122t have anything to show. But we needed something because we were in the Russian occupied zone, and I don\u2122t know how long we were there. One of the tenant was a chemist, and he found a job in a smoke factory there, to earn some money. And next day he comes and says, \ufb01Come with me, they need a cook in the employees cafeteria, in the manager\u2122s restaurant .\ufb02 I have absolutely no recollection that I worked there, until I read one of the two kids memoirs, where he names the factory. So the name immediately sprang up, and I knew I know it. But even with that knowledge, I could not remember that I worked there. But I must have, because th ey all told me, and I brought food to the school for them. So -- and I don\u2122 know how long we were there. Somehow time is not very noticeable, if you don\u2122t have a calendar, you don\u2122t have a routine, and that responsibility. Okay, and then we picked ourselves up and went home by means of freight trains, military trucks, horse-drawn carriages, walking. We were already strengthened -- strong by that time. The day we mo ved out from that British barrack, the diarrhea stopped like immediately. And our digestiv e systems started to work normally, cause we didn\u2122t eat like pigs any more. Oh, there was a -- and one story, and 114 it\u2122s a funny story, one of the guys came and sa id down a little past the village is a pig farm, and a lot of pigs there, and nobody\u2122s watching them, feeding them. So I found some -- a little hammer and a piece of rope, and we said we go down and get ourselves a pig with the sled. And I go there, and there were lots of pigs running around, and they were in the building. So I found one, tied a rope to his hind leg, and tied the rope to the -- to that column, the supporting column, and hit him on the head, that\u2122s how you kill pigs. But the hammer was small, and I was not st rong enough yet, and when you hit them here, it swells up and you can never break his skull any more. So it was screaming there, and suddenly we hear machine gun fire. I -- oh my God, the Germans are back. So we look out, and on top of that farm, a Russian co lumn, military column pass by, and one was shooting the pigs with a machine gun, and they were throwing them at cars and trucks as they ro -- drove by. And the guy sees me with a knife, and commandeered me to about 12 or 13 pigs to eviscerate them. They want -- he want only the meat, not the innard. So I did that, and I said, \ufb01Now I worked for you, now you come and shoot my pig.\ufb02 And one of those wanted only the two hind legs, it was a [indecipherable] soldier. So we had one and a half pig, and a innards from a liver, and the organs from 12 more pigs. I don\u2122t even know how we brought it all on that sled. We we re rendering the lard till 10 at night. And there was no worry about refrigeration, it was cold enough. So that -- we consumed all that -- I\u2122m sorry -- okay, we started on our way home from Katowice, and we had to go -- I told you all the means we went, but I have to turn around to tell you -- to give you the direction. We were here, in Katowice. We went to the Ukraine, to Romania, to Hungary, Austria and Prague."

There was a crematorium in Terez\u00edn. They started first, when few people died, individual graves. My grandmother is in an individual grave. Then mass graves, without -- without coffins b ecause the Germans wouldn\u2122t supply wood for that.
