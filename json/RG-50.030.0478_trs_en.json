And there was no friction between the Germans and the Jews until I think in 1930, when Hitler came to power, he started to demand of the leaders of that German Nationals -- of those German Nationals, to start to agitate, and complain about oppression by the Czechoslovakian government, and it -- and demand to be annexed by the Nazis. And by 1933, it -- three years later, it came to the point where my father as a Jew couldn\u2019t make a living among those Germans. And he moved to Prague."

So I don\u2019t know what -- we found out in the archives that his father was a -- had a small store in a -- in a very small town in central Bohemia. And -- so at age 16, he went to Vienna, to be able to earn some money, and he worked himself up to a tremendous position in a textile factory, to the point where he supported his brothers to go to school, and accumulate a dowry for his three sisters. So in World War I, he must have been acknowledged by the military as a good administrator, so he became administrator of a hospital in Karlsbad. And there he then later settled.

They were aware of being Jewish, and if they weren\u2019t aware th -- of, this would have made them aware. But the Czech -- Czechs were not antisimic -- not aggressively anti-Semitic. I think they handled the Jews in a way that they didn\u2019t know what they are, and how different they are from them, and kept them a little at arm\u2019s length. And some would be very nice to you, and then when you turned your back they would say, there goes the dirty Jew. This kind of hidden anti- Semitism. But I never -- I never suffered by it."

I spoke about the optimism. When the six months were over, they gave themselves another six months. So they played in attics, and in cellars, to stay in shape for when they come out, they should be in the same performance level as they came in. And although there are no -- were no Germans in the ghetto, nothing escaped them, they found out. And now a terrific fright and concern gripped everyone in the ghetto, because the Germans -- a few Germans kept all these thousands of Jews in check by imposing corrective punishment. So what that means, were two kinds, either right away into the transport, with -- and these people were marked, when they were in the transport, in Auschwitz they know who they are, and they select them -- direct them to the appropriate side, punishing side, or the small fortress. So nobody wanted to involve their wife, parents, children, siblings in such a punishment, so there was a big concern. The head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein told the camp commander why -- I mean, not in this exact wording, I\u2019m paraphrasing, why would you punish these few people? Look at the amount of talent you have accumulated here, why don\u2019t you think of a program where you can utilize them to show the world how well you treat the Jews? That\u2019s when this idea came into being. It was not a preconceived idea with the Germans before the ghetto was created. So not only were these Jews not punished, and could retain their instruments, more instruments were brought in from Prague, and before they determined how they are going to do -- show the world how well they treat the Jews, they already divide -- devised a beautification program in anticipation of that, and a free time activities department was created. And in the frame of this orchestras -- jazz has just come to -- to Europe from United States, so we had a five member -- what is it called? Ghetto swingers. Ghetto swingers jazz team. Then there were the two musicians who played in the caf\u00e9. One of them was my cousin, the accordionist, he was a piano and accor -- but there he played the accordion, and one was a violinist. And -- and other of the quartets, and unbelievable, not the Germans, and not the Council of Elders could have imagined what\u2019s getting news there. And not only music, there were theaters -- there were all the actors from -- from all these towns. The theater, cabaret, those are very popular because they were throwing these verbal darts at the Germans, in Czech language. Maybe some even in German, I don\u2019t know about those. And this was very uplifting, and very helping in -- in really reducing the anxieties of the life that was destined for us. There were lectures. There were 1240 lectures on different subjects. This is based on the notes from that -- that they found from that free activity -- free time activity list, by professors, chemists, biologists, rabbis. Nobody went to the temple, but they went there to listen to the rabbi. And people who had no interest in chemistry and so, went to j -- just to get diversification, and -- and getting away from -- from this dread life of ghetto. By the way, they called -- you know, Terezin in German is Theresienstadt, and the Nazis told these prominent people they go to Theresienbath, which is a Theresien spa. I didn\u2019t say it when we were on the subject. So it is an unbe -- there was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in New York or -- or anywhere else, in a day. And people after work went, and they -- they shortened their sleeping time, because they were not really strong with the -- with the food they were getting, and I don\u2019t take blame for it. I just did what was -- we had. But it was -- it was unbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew like mushrooms after the rain. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And the job had a good side and a bad one. Everything 1n life, I guess, has a good and a bad side. The good one was when a wagon with garbage came in, I had the first pick.

Walking back to the camp, I see ahead of me a huge -- only maybe it just seemed that -- that huge to me, onion on the edge -- on the side of the road. So I look back where the guard 1s, and told the guy behind me, step a little bit out of formation, cover me. And I bent down, and picked it up and put it in the jacket to take it to camp, because whatever either one of the three of us found, stole, or otherwise, we shared. So I took it in to share it with them. And we were brought in and lined up on the roll call area for frisking. We were frisked on -- infreque -- not infrequently like little, but unannounced because we were working with tools, and we could have made some weapon, a knife, or -- or something which the Germans did not like very much. So what do I do with the onion? If I throw it away and don\u2019t say it was me, everybody gets punished, the old theme of collective punishment. If I say it was me, they beat me to a pulp because they won\u2019t believe I found it, they will think I stole -- they will insist I stole it. Only one way out, to eat the onion, quickly. This is with the peel and with those little roots on it. The eyes were -- tears were coming down my cheeks, and the nose was running, and sweat in that cold, wintry day, sweat was coming up on my forehead. And when he ca -- I finished it before he came to me, and I didn\u2019t dare to breathe while he was frisking me.

So that was the moment. I slipped to -- into the ditch on the side of the road. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t encourage the kids to do it too, but I felt I don\u2019t want to be responsible in case -- you know, to suggest something where they may suffer. And I laid down in the snow, face down. And there was -- must have been a zealous guard who shot me. And whether it was the dark, or whether it was frozen fingers, I don\u2019t know. He shot me under the arm, and the bullet got stuck in the rib. And the snow -- the -- the blood was color -- starting to color the snow, and that was good, because nobody else attempted a second shot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly had strength to pick myself up, and went into the forest, and found like minded people, other prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot. So we huddled together and used the blanket in ma -- outside in -- in January in the forest with this -- just a cotton uniform, and I think we all slept, sitting, holding each other. And in the morning we went to the edge of the forest, that the road we came from, looking whether we find a sign where we are, what\u2019s happening. And we see the top of the hill another camp. The gate is Open, no guard in the watch tower, and prisoners walking in and out. So inside the forest we ran -- suddenly we could not only walk, we could run, near to that camp, and we asked one of the prisoners, \u201cWell what -- well what is this?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but before dawn, all the Germans jumped into car -- into the trucks and took off.\u2019 Didn\u2019t even take the time to liquidate the camp, with machine guns, and -- and hand grenades. So what really happened, in that area, a Russian tank force cut a wedge into the German front. And of course they didn\u2019t want to be caught by the Russians, so they jumped in the trucks and left in a hurry. We -- I went into the camp, and saw guys from our camp. I said, \u201cWhere were you located?\u201d Sort of the last block, because that was the last group that arrived there. And I found the two kids there, and we started to look for food, but we didn\u2019t find any, because those who were there already, they plundered the -- the -- the potato storage, and all -- all other storages. But somebody told us there\u2019s, on the side the road, 1s a abandoned village where the German population ran the same way as the SS, and there\u2019s food in their pantries. So we went there, not far, and there\u2019s food. Everything except bread. They must have taken the loaf and bread and ran. The speed at which they ran wa -- showed itself.

But it had a effec -- had it\u2019s effects. This was a huge place, the -- that camp was called Blechhammer, and it was part of a huge industrial complex. All the camp inmates were working in it -- of forced laborers from occupied countries were there, and POW\u2019s were also there, and were working. We found the camp of the British prisoners of war, and for some reason -- they were bombing London, but for some reason they were treating the British POW\u2019s very well. We found in that barrack warm uniforms, boots, socks, scarves, caps, coats, and a lot of toilet paper, which saved us from result of the way we were eating. There were 10 of us in -- in one of those barracks, there were two toilets, one on each end, and that wasn\u2019t enough. So they brought from the village, I don\u2019t know, somewhere, a huge half barrel, like a big whiskey barrel. I put two boards across so four could sit at the same time. That bad it was. I started to improvise cooking, and one guy was helping me, and eight did -- the rest of the 10, the eight went to town to bring supplies. The one kid I mentioned was working the carpentry shop in Terezin, he made a sled so more stuff could be brought. And there\u2019s one point he brought the whole - took out from one of those houses a kitchen stove, including the pipes. He installed it, and then we were really cooking. The Russian soldiers came to eat, to us, because they didn\u2019t get food like that. It was another compliment for the aunt. And we\u2019re cooking till 10 in the evening, and by 10:15, there wasn\u2019t a bite to be had. That\u2019s how we ate. No -- no control. And the Russian soldiers told us how wonderful Communism 1s, everybody is even, and it\u2019s the best system, until a Jewish officer came, a Russian Jewish officer, said, \u201cDon\u2019t believe a word.\u201d We were thinking of Communism, because that\u2019s a -- was presented to us as a real equal society, a society of equal people. But he set us straight. We were six weeks in that British barracks, because between where we were, and our home, they were still fighting. You know, from the east front, we were here, and Prague was here, and the Russians were only getting there. So for six weeks we suffered terrible diarrhea. And in spite of it, I gained 79 pounds within six weeks, with my own cooking. I said -- what\u2019s her name, I fi -- know this -- this diet advertiser, Jenny Craig would have gone crazy if she heard that somebody gained 79 pounds in six weeks. And everybody -- after six weeks we moved out of there, and went to Katowice -- here come friend of the spelling. And they put us up in the schoolhouse where or -- other -- other form of prisoners were. And the Polish Red Cross gave us identification papers based on what we told them, because we didn\u2019t have anything to show. But we needed something because we were in the Russian occupied zone, and I don\u2019t know how long we were there. One of the tenant was a chemist, and he found a job in a smoke factory there, to earn some money. And next day he comes and says, \u201cCome with me, they need a cook in the employees cafeteria, in the manager\u2019s restaurant.\u201d I have absolutely no recollection that I worked there, until I read one of the two kids memoirs, where he names the factory. So the name immediately sprang up, and I knew I know it. But even with that knowledge, I could not remember that I worked there. But I must have, because they all told me, and I brought food to the school for them. So -- and I don\u2019 know how long we were there. Somehow time is not very noticeable, if you don\u2019t have a calendar, you don\u2019t have a routine, and that responsibility. Okay, and then we picked ourselves up and went home by means of freight trains, military trucks, horse-drawn carriages, walking. We were already strengthened -- strong by that time. The day we moved out from that British barrack, the diarrhea stopped like immediately. And our digestive systems started to work normally, cause we didn\u2019t eat like pigs any more. Oh, there was a -- and one story, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 it\u2019s a funny story, one of the guys came and said down a little past the village 1s a pig farm, and a lot of pigs there, and nobody\u2019s watching them, feeding them. So I found some- a little hammer and a piece of rope, and we said we go down and get ourselves a pig with the sled. And I go there, and there were lots of pigs running around, and they were in the building. So I found one, tied a rope to his hind leg, and tied the rope to the -- to that column, the supporting column, and hit him on the head, that\u2019s how you kill pigs. But the hammer was small, and I was not strong enough yet, and when you hit them here, it swells up and you can never break his skull any more. So it was screaming there, and suddenly we hear machine gun fire. I -- oh my God, the Germans are back. So we look out, and on top of that farm, a Russian column, military column pass by, and one was shooting the pigs with a machine gun, and they were throwing them at cars and trucks as they ro -- drove by. And the guy sees me with a knife, and commandeered me to about 12 or 13 pigs to eviscerate them. They want -- he want only the meat, not the innard. So I did that, and I said, \u201cNow I worked for you, now you come and shoot my pig.\u201d And one of those wanted only the two hind legs, it was a [indecipherable] soldier. So we had one and a half pig, and a innards from a liver, and the organs from 12 more pigs. I don\u2019t even know how we brought it all on that sled. We were rendering the lard till 10 at night. And there was no worry about refrigeration, it was cold enough. So that -- we consumed all that -- I\u2019m sorry -- okay, we started on our way home from Katowice, and we had to go -- I told you all the means we went, but I have to turn around to tell you -- to give you the direction. We were here, in Katowice. We went to the Ukraine, to Romania, to Hungary, Austria and Prague."

Then mass graves, without -- without coffins because the Germans wouldn\u2019t supply wood for that.
