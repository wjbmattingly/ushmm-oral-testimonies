And for years and years I used to daydream and night dream \u2014no, night dream I was dreaming about horrible things and I was a \u2014 afraid of getting out of the \u2014 of the bed. Was quite awful, the night dreams. But during the day I used to daydream that they \u2014 they will come back. They will come for me. So all \u2014 each time when somebody came, you know, it was a new hope. But then Badana(ph) said, that\u2019s it, stop. I don\u2019t want it any more. And then, when my \u2014 when we heard from my uncle, I think that 1t was after the \u2014 no, 1t was before the war, before the \u201948 war. He discovered me through Aliyah Tenora(ph), through the youth organization. And he started to write letters, and s \u2014 and send me all kind of beautiful clothes, because at that time we all had \u2014 all the children had clothes from people from America, from [indecipherable]. Only me, I didn't have \u2014 also, I wouldn\u2019t have because my adopted mother was a very idealistic person and she wouldn\u2019t accept it, you know, that \u2014 but he did send me things, beautiful things. And also, Hilde Huppert used to come to visit me, and Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph), this lady with the child. She \u2014 they both used to come to visit me. And Hilde used to bring me all things that she was knitted, cause she was a very good knitter. And I have a picture of myself with the knitting sweater that she have. And so, in this sense, I \u2014 I felt okay with the other children. And then was the \u201948 war, was another war. So from war to war, and the \u2014 again, I think that I was on my own. I was \u2014 I wa \u2014 not on my own at that time, because \u2014 but then a \u2014 was the kindergarten teacher, so she was with the other children. That what my brother meant when we were alone, with [indecipherable] parents. And I remember sitting on this truck with my six months old brother on my lap, when all the other mothers were sitting with their babies, with their children, and I was sitting with him. So, I was on my own."
