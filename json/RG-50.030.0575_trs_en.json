So, they didn\u2122t want, becaus e that was their idea in that time. And there were very, very sad stories becaus e of that. Nobody ask questions, nobody talked. We didn\u2122t talk.

And \u0152 and also, I was \u0152 I am \u0152 I \u0152 well, I remember very early in my life that I was thinking that I probably did something horrible, if that\u2122s what happened to me. So, if I don\u2122t have mother and father, and no \u0152 so, that was a thought that walked with me qu ite a long \u0152 many years in my childhood. Then, there were \u0152 people used to come to look for their relatives, the first years. And each time wh en they came, I was already \u0152 already was thinking that maybe one day, you know, the door will open and my mother will come in, or my father. And for years and years I used to daydream and night dream \u0152 no, night dream I was dreaming about ho rrible things and I was a \u0152 afraid of getting out of the \u0152 of the bed. Was quite awful, the night dreams. But during the day I used to daydream that they \u0152 they will come back. They will come for me. So all \u0152 each time when somebody came, you know, it was a new hope. But then Badana(ph) said, that\u2122s it, stop. I don\u2122t want it any more. And then, when my \u0152 when we heard from my uncle, I think that it was after the \u0152 no, it was before the war, before the \u212248 war. He discovered me through Aliyah Tenora(ph), through the youth organization. And he st arted to write letters, and s \u0152 and send me all kind of beautiful clothes, because at that time we all had \u0152 all the children had clothes from 45 people from America, from [indecipherable] . Only me, I didn't have \u0152 also, I wouldn\u2122t have because my adopted moth er was a very idealistic person and she wouldn\u2122t accept it, you know, that \u0152 but he did send me things, beautiful things. And also, Hilde Huppert used to come to visit me, and Nuta(ph) Gudkowski (ph), this lady with the child. She \u0152 they both used to come to visit me. And Hilde used to bring me all things that she was knitted, cause she was a very good knitter. And I have a picture of myself with the knitting sweater that she have. And so, in this sense, I \u0152 I felt okay with the other childre n. And then was the \u212248 war, was another war. So from war to war, and the \u0152 again, I think that I was on my own.
