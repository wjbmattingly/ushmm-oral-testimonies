            "answer": "They are in Poland, yeah, the ma \u2014 the kibbutz \u2014 the kibbutz mot \u2014 founders are all Polish. And few of them came \u2014 my adopted mother, her name is Badana(ph), the \u2014 the \u2014 her family had the school and kindergar \u2014 garten in Hebrew, in Lodz. So, their first language is Hebrew. And the \u2014 some of the people in the kibbutz, they were in the kindergarten and in the school. This is the Katznelson(ph) family which Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 44 the Katznelson [indecipherable] family which was [indecipherable] very, sort of known family. So, they didn\u2019t want, because that was their idea in that time. And there were very, very sad stories because of that. Nobody ask questions, nobody talked. We didn\u2019t talk. Of course, I didn\u2019t talk, because I want \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to be like the rest, wanted just stories that I\u2019m telling. And \u2014 and also, I was \u2014 lam \u2014 I - well, I remember very early in my life that I was thinking that I probably did something horrible, if that\u2019s what happened to me. So, if I don\u2019t have mother and father, and no \u2014 so, that was a thought that walked with me quite a long \u2014 many years in my childhood. Then, there were \u2014 people used to come to look for their relatives, the first years. And each time when they came, I was already \u2014 already was thinking that maybe one day, you know, the door will open and my mother will come in, or my father. And for years and years I used to daydream and night dream \u2014no, night dream I was dreaming about horrible things and I was a \u2014 afraid of getting out of the \u2014 of the bed. Was quite awful, the night dreams. But during the day I used to daydream that they \u2014 they will come back. They will come for me. So all \u2014 each time when somebody came, you know, it was a new hope. But then Badana(ph) said, that\u2019s it, stop. I don\u2019t want it any more. And then, when my \u2014 when we heard from my uncle, I think that 1t was after the \u2014 no, 1t was before the war, before the \u201948 war. He discovered me through Aliyah Tenora(ph), through the youth organization. And he started to write letters, and s \u2014 and send me all kind of beautiful clothes, because at that time we all had \u2014 all the children had clothes from USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0575 45 people from America, from [indecipherable]. Only me, I didn't have \u2014 also, I wouldn\u2019t have because my adopted mother was a very idealistic person and she wouldn\u2019t accept it, you know, that \u2014 but he did send me things, beautiful things. And also, Hilde Huppert used to come to visit me, and Nuta(ph) Gudkowski(ph), this lady with the child. She \u2014 they both used to come to visit me. And Hilde used to bring me all things that she was knitted, cause she was a very good knitter. And I have a picture of myself with the knitting sweater that she have. And so, in this sense, I \u2014 I felt okay with the other children. And then was the \u201948 war, was another war. So from war to war, and the \u2014 again, I think that I was on my own. I was \u2014 I wa \u2014 not on my own at that time, because \u2014 but then a \u2014 was the kindergarten teacher, so she was with the other children. That what my brother meant when we were alone, with [indecipherable] parents. And I remember sitting on this truck with my six months old brother on my lap, when all the other mothers were sitting with their babies, with their children, and I was sitting with him. So, I was on my own."
