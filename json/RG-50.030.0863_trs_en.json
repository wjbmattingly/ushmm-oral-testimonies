He went to his boss at Sears Roebuck and said that, you know, these people will not be a burden, the man is a doctor, he\u2122ll come to United States, he\u2122ll practice medicine here, but Interview with Erika Tamar December 18, 2015 37he needs this affidavit.

One day on deck I was swamped by a wave, and my leggings, or whatever I wore, were soaked, and I was just standing there by myself helplessly, and I didn\u2122t know what to do. And this young woman saw me, and took me to her stateroom, and got me out of my wet leggings and gave me something dry to wear. And I remember a stateroom full of colorful birds. Now, this is a four year old\u2122s memory. It\u2122s perfectly possible that there were three birds. I just remember all these birds, ma \u0152 I have no idea.

I know I spent time there, and I do know I slept there at least once, and that it wasn\u2122t my imagination because she sent a letter to my mother, she got my mother\u2122s address. She put me to sleep, and she says, sweet dreams, and I said, I\u2122m going to dream about my mother. And she wrote that to my mother. So that clarifies that I really did sleep in her stateroom."
