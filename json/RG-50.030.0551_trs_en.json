And then, by the age of around two, we were put in hiding in a place called Vales(ph) Galant(ph), and I have absolutely no memory of that time. And after I think about \u2014 well, I guess around 1945, we were brought by relatives to an orphanage. I just today learned that we were in several places, but I only know of one place, Taverne, an orphanage in Taverne, a Jewish orphanage, where I was until the age of [indecipherable] until 1948, when \u2014 Interview with Annette Fein : November 7, 2008 where I then was adopted by American citizens, who were bo-both born in Russia, but they were both \u2014 they were both already American citizens, and we \u2014 I believe that happened in 1947, and it took about a year for the whole process to be finished, and I moved to America at the age of eight, 1948."

And, again this \u2014 this interior decorator said to me that we went to school, evidently, and in order to go to school, we left the orphanage and passed a Catholic school. So, perhaps that kind of \u2014 so, for \u2014 at that point, that explained to me why I remember something like that. The details, nothing at all, right. And there was one other thing of someone \u2014 and again, I\u2019ve never delved into it, because it\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a pleasant thing to remember, about \u2014 something about a tree, and a \u2014 interestingly enough, I had a time when I di\u2014 I would paint a lot of trees. And someone once decided that it wou \u2014 it showed that I \u2014 my \u2014 I hadn\u2019t \u2014 that I didn\u2019t have roots, and that was why I was drawing trees. And I said, fine, that\u2019s, you know, pretty clear, and understandable. But there was one thing that there was a mat \u2014 someone who had a lot of keys, and I think there was a name called zoo or zoe or something like that. And this could have been a dream, or it could have been something in detail, that someone was hanging from a tree, that\u2019s all I remember. I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 it was never made \u2014 never clear, and I really don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not all that interested to know too much about that. [indecipherable]"
