Now, a [indecipherable] statement is that Lodz was the second largest city in Poland, Warsaw was the capital, Lodz was the industrial city, and it was called the Polish Manchester. And the -- really the only industrial city in Poland, which meant that it was also a city of social and political ferment. The union -- uni -- birth of the unions, the workers movement etcetera, and I was born in that atmosphere. A big city coming into being as a substantial industrial city, in a Poland that was mostly, or only agricultural before. The city -- the population of the city consisted of sort of three parts. Pol -- Poles, Jews, and Germans. The industrial trend was coming from the west, so the Germans were a very important element, establishing all kinds of industrial complexes, but the main thing how this textile business came to be, is through -- I don\u2019t know th-the name would it be -- for people working at the loom in their own apartments. So they would be home workers, and when you -- when I was going to school, from my home to my school, I would pass many homes where on the first floor you could hear the click of the looms, one after another and you saw men sitting in the loom and working. That -- that was the basic thing, what built, you know, industry in Lodz. And then of course, the -- were the big manufacturing things and Germans, it was mostly in German hands, big, you know, big stores, and big commerce, led mostly by Germans and Jews and Poles. So it was a three part city that lived pretty much in peace til the war broke out."

She never used the name, neither did I, but looking back when I got in touch with my feminism in modern times here, in America, I was recalling that where I -- where I got it from. And I don\u2019t know, life was good, and I knew that. Why? Because I was very observant, and I was, you know, had many friends, and visited, and revisited. And also each time when I went to another home, my mother was drilling me, what did you see, what was the furniture, who lived there, etcetera."

So -- but I also saw the relationship, you know, in the homes, and I always came back and ti -- this time that the relationship were the best in my home, between my parents and between my parents and children. But i -- so what she was saying about her life was sometimes she got very a -- not sometimes, very often, she was very angry. She was also very laughing and singing, you know, so all -- all emotions were just on the surface. And she would say, when she was angry with my father a little too much, I would say, \u201cMother, what do you want? Don\u2019t you realize you have the best husband, and I have the best father?\u201d She says, \u201cI realize that, but look at his life and look at my life. He gets up, I fix breakfast, he eats, he gets dressed. I see that he\u2019s properly dressed and go -- he goes to work outside, for fun. What do I do? I clean, I cook, I clean, I cook, I shop and clean and cook. And I would like to work, I would like to be in the outside world.\u201d So I said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you?\u201d Because I cannot. You know, she was the daughter of a pretty well to do -- a construction -- a builder, he was building houses. And before the w -- first war, they were quite well-to-do. After the war I saw a lot of paper money around, bags of paper money, and I knew that that\u2019s where the money went. You know, there was a total wipe-out. And she says, \u201cI could not work, my father would never let him, it would be a bad mark, if he -- his daughter, Shlomo Gavcewicz\u2019s daughter would work? Never. And now, since I am married, if I would work, that would mean that your father is not capable of supporting a family. So I cannot do that, it would be hell. That\u2019s my life. But you, you will be different. You will get all the education so that you can work, and life will be different for you.\u201d That was my mother."

            "answer": "Not at all. Straightforward. And about bitterness and anger, I -- you know, particularly when I became a physician and I learned from families for women and I notice that the biggest characteristics of women\u2019s upbringing was don\u2019t be angry, cover it, don\u2019t be a -- and I -- at first I didn\u2019t understand, but then I understood that those were the messages in this culture that families gave to girls. Anger is for boys, and for you, be nice and sweet. So, I remember then, you know, how my life -- when I was angry, Mother never stopped me, only let me -- let me fume, then at one point she says, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re angry. How long -- how long will it last?\u201d That stopped me. In other word, you can get angry, it\u2019s okay with me, but don\u2019t overdo that."

You see, to our right was Russia, that just became Bolshevik Russia, and that was a big experiment, and we couldn\u2019t stop talking about it. You know, kids. Grown-ups, too, but it was a forbidden thing to even think about. Ye -- Communism was forbidden by the Polish reactionary government, and other governments, you know, it was a sort of a new things, and so that was all discussed in hush with friends, so I had some friends that were very interested in the question as was I, and I was reading to no end, all the, you know, chief writers of Communism, Socialism. And I know that was not against what my father was thinking, but we nev -- it was unspoken because if you were caught and went to -- the thing was that the kids that were then caught in the -- this Communist spirit, and infiltration, you know, there was infiltration from Soviet Union by youths, too, and you could hear murmurs, you know, when we were going out of school by Friday, come to the meeting, come to the meeting here and here. And we knew that was Communist meetings, but you didn\u2019t dare to think about it because you could get expelled from school, and kids were getting expelled from getting involved in Communist cells. But the curiosity at that age is so strong, that I could just not -- you know, put it together aside. So we had couple kids that were on the same wavelengths and we would read and discuss, and discuss, particularly about w-what is -- how -- what are the best way to edu -- to bring up children. And you know, part of the Communist agenda was to -- to -- to put a wedge between parents and children and took away ch- take away children, often to -- for separate education and so on. And that was dangerous stuff, you know, at home to talk about. But we talked nevertheless, and what we think, what would be better, there was endless discussions. And then one time -- this friend of mine that was mostly knowledgeable said, look, there is a meeting such and such a day, such and such a place, I have a friend and he wants us to go, a-and participate there. So I said, \u201cYou know, Stephanie, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d \u201cOh, who cares, come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go.\u201d So we went, and that was the friend that took us there, and it was in the Polish section of town. Actually, 1t was in the section of town that later was turned into the ghetto for Jews. So we were in there on a little, small, apartment, you know, very high up, and there were people around the table. It was cold, it was winter, 1t was bitter cold. And there was a little iron stove that was giving a little heat, and a lot of people, and so we were sitting there. And you know the saying is that poverty s-smells. That was just my experience, the poverty stunk there. It was so poor. People were from the very, very poor population, sitting, and there was this guy, and this guy just came from Russia. Communist, propagandist, and was talking, and everybody was hushed and listening. And he was talking what a great country Soviet Union is, how things are good, how poor people are doing well, how the regime 1s taking care of poor people, etcetera, etcetera, and of course they all listened and loved it. And, okay, so we went -- you know, that was after that, went home and I had all kinds of -- they were really not mixed feelings, I understood very well why this guy looked and was received like a -- as a prophet. You know, smelling the smell of poverty, and the posture of those poor people, you know, the babushkas and so on. I said, well they are looking for a prophet. They have it so bad that I am not surprised that they are looking for that. But then I said, you know, as for -- later on I said, well, it\u2019s not my life. I am not part of it. He da -- you know, he cannot speak to me, he did not speak to me. And that was it for me, you know? The contact with Communism, and the aura of paradise, but I understood that. So that was this episode of my life."

It was a- avery sore spot between Poland and Germany. Poland in s -- Danzig -- Gdansk and Danzig, both countries thought it belongs to them. Finally, after the first World War, there was this agreement that Poland got a little bit of corridor, because Poland wanted some access to the sea, Baltic Sea. And if -- 1f Gdansk become Danzig, you know, Poland would have nothing. So they agreed to a small corridor that would lead to the Baltic Sea, so that both countries had access, and that Gdansk, or Danzig -- Poland will have access to -- to Gdansk to use it as a port. They were building another port, Gdynia, but that was later. Okay, so that was sort of a sore spot between the two countries, and a sore spot to erupt. The news came that Polish troops crossed into Germany across this small corridor, and germa -- Germany was ready to attack. What turned out later that the troops -- Polish troops were Germans dressed in Polish uniforms. So they provoked that, and they attacked. In Lodz what did we do? Well, we knew they are coming, and we developed, you know, sort of on the street, some defense. We will be watching or walking the streets, particularly the youth, and I was part of it, and watching for signs of airplanes coming, German airplanes at-attacking. So we were watching -- you know, walking around the blocks for a couple days. And then finally the news came on the radio that the German are on Polish so -- soil, and they are coming. So what I remember about that? I was there -- we were there, my grandmother and my mother. I think Father was at work, and my mother burst out crying. And she says, \u201cI won\u2019t make it, not a second time. Lived through the first World War, it was horrible, I won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d And to me it was, my God, if Mother says that, I am doomed as well, I cannot take it, I cannot do anything like that without my mommy. So that was it. So we were still marching and watching, and watching and reporting to the elders. Nothing was happening, and then all of a sudden we ha -- we heard some bombs falling. But Lodz did not suffer from the bombing. It was, you know, here and there [indecipherable] nothing was happening, and one day the troops were marching in. And the Germans were in. And we were still waiting. We were ating -- waiting, and pretty soon the Germans started to paste orders on the w -- on the street walls, you know, the special walls when you put -- what do you call it when you put news?"

And some others started -- began to go to Jewish neighbors and taking out things, furniture, etcetera, etcetera. Sort of unprovoked, nothing, it was the Pole that started the war with the Jews. And I remember I was so furious about it. We had a neighbor, another neighbor who was a middle-aged woman, a businesswoman, she was a widow, and she and her son were running a little factory, they were making cardboard boxes. And she spoke perfectly German and so on, and I talked with her and I say, \u201cWhat do we do, Mrs. Kronenburg?\u201d And then I say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s do something.\u201d And she says, \u201cHow about you and me will go to the German quarters and report our neighbors, they are robbing us?\u201d I said okay, and Mother said okay, she didn\u2019t want to go. And that Mrs. Kronenburg spoke German very well. I spoke German too because German was second language in -- in -- in high school, foreign language. So we went to the German commando, very innocent, you know, and we asked to talk to the chief, and we tell him such and such, with disgust, that we are being ro-robed -- robbed, and that -- is that legal, is that how it should be? And he says no, it should not be. So he s -- asks an officer to come with us and stop the rob-robbery from our neighbors. And the officer came with us and talked to the neighbors that were robbing.

Not his orphanage, but the Polish population. And that we would, boys and girls go there and learn farming in preparation for the -- to go into Palestine and become kibbutznik farmers. So, you know, we needed to have the permission of our parents, and then a group of us went there. And we spent a full year there. And it was a wonderful time, a time that permit us who were willing to be there, to forget where we were. It was out of this world, really. It was a huge house, a orphanage, you know, so there was big halls. And our group was probably not more than 20 boys and girls. Boys separate, girls separate bedrooms, etcetera. And in the morning we would go to school. We would go by -- by carriages, you know, we had some people that were bringing u -- by horse and buggy, big buggy, to school, and then afternoon we would come to the farm. We call it Hak\u2019shara, which is Hebrew for farm. And it has the Zionist implication, but we couldn\u2019t give a damn about -- at that time about the implication of Palestine, 1t was just a lovely place. It was a farm that used to be used -- you know, it was used by Poles as a farm, and also had animals. It had goats, and chickens, etcetera. And there was one guy, he was a German Jew who was a farmer, and knew about, you know, farming, and other than going to school, homework, etcetera, he would teach us what to do. In other word, we would sow seeds, and all kinds of thing, and take care of the growing crop. There was a orchard, and there were the animals. The animals we would -- let\u2019s see, there were some cows, and there were some goats, and we would learn how to milk them. And then distru -- distribute the milk by buggies, and -- horse and buggies to cooperative, to stores, you know, run by the -- by Rumkowski that will be selling it to the population on carts and so on. So it was a ideal love -- life, really. Very gratifying. Of course, we paired up, boys and girls, and so were some romances going and that was, under the circumstances, unheard of. We -- of course, were properly chaperoned by mothers that would take turn and come for overnight to be with -- with the -- you know, with us, to make sure nothing was happening. So that was the --"

And we -- we were living there totally, and working. So that was -- lasted for awhile, and that was finished. Now, we were doing the -- the prevat -- prefabricated parts with cement, mixing cement, pouring it into forms, taking out -- you know, we learned the whole production of how do you do -- how you do it. And that ended. But another job that I had was working in a kitchen, and that was the best job. An-And really ended badly. There was a occasion to go to work for a kitchen that was established -- kitchen restaurant, so to speak, establish by Rumkowski that was producing dinners one -- once a day dinners for people that work in different kind of industries and were given a bonus to come to this -- to this kitchen for a dinner, for a week or two weeks or so. It was a extra sort of a pay-off for good work and so on. And working in that kitchen, of course it was wonderful, because you could eat, okay? You didn\u2019t have to be hungry, right? So -- and it was nice, there was a nice by -- bunch of girls, familiar also from the school, and it was nice to work there. We made hamburgers, we do this, we chopped up all kind that was needed 1n the kitchen, under the supervise -- supervision of women cooks. And then what happened was that there was a Sonderkommando older guy, you know, that I and he knew each other, I don\u2019t remember from where, but there were no hard feelings bet -- between us, there was some hostility. I don\u2019t know what -- what was the cause, but at any rate, he was on duty one day, and I went -- supposedly I was asking the cook that was serving the soup -- I was serving -- you know, the guy that -- the Czech that was supervising the women police, and he was there e -- as a client, and I suppose that he asked the server to give me a little more in the plate of soup, because I wanted to, you know. And this Kohn, Kohn was his name, caught me doing that, and therefore did saw that I was kicked out from the kitchen, from my good job. Himself was a -- a s-son of a gun, you know, terrible guy to get to be accused of anything. And -- an-and -- and that was it, so that job ended, and I was sent, as a punishment, I was sent to a -- to a resort, a -- a factory that was making stuff out of wood. That means they were making wooden chairs, wooden wagons, you know, wheels, wooden wheels. It was a huge factory, under one roof, you know, just huge, full of machineries that produced a lot of dust when you worked them. So that was my punishment. I was sent to Siberia, and I was there for about a year or so. It was a tough year, really. Hard work, a lot of dust, and I was punished, you know, that was punishment. So what can I say."

So we knew broadly what was happening, and we knew where the Germans were, you know, the trip to Siberia, and Stalingrad.

And we began to worry about it because she could be the next deported person. So the question was how do we get -- we need to get her a job. Who will get her a job? My father could not hit right. And then was the -- also the peculiar situation in ghetto of reversed roles. You know, the people -- kids like myself that were coming of age in the ghetto, but they were children in school, but by the time it was going on, they were 17 - 18. There was the support of the -- of the ghetto. That on them leaned the economy of life in the ghetto. Those were the people with strength, that could work and buy time for Rumkowski from the Germans. So all of the sudden I became very important in the group -- in the populati -- in the, you know, population. And influential. So my father said, \u201cWell you have to do something.\u201d But what can I do? We have to do something. At this time I was working 1n this housing department which had couple bosses, one older man, and his assistant -- I forget their names, Wolf -- one was Wolfe, the young one was Wolfe, and the older I don\u2019t remember. And the -- you know, older guy and his assistant was the younger guy, and they -- you know, we had very good relationship, they respected me, I respected them, 1-it was nice. So I said, I have to go to both of them and ask if they can find a job for Mother. It was a dangerous step, because you had to pay. And what does a young girl pay? How does a young girl pay? Sex, right? So that was written in big letters. Am I willing to pay that for my mother getting a job? I had to count on that, when I go to one or the other. That\u2019s how Rumkowski comes in that category, too. When people came, women, particularly young women came to him with begging for some favor, like for a sick person to get some medicine, or what n -- extraordinary thing, they had to pay. So I said, what do I do? And I cannot talk to Father about that. So I said, well, God help me, and I go to both of them. But to one, the older one, he was a chief, and tell him such and such, and I need a job for Mother, to keep her alive. What can I tell you my surprise that he didn\u2019t ask for a prize, and he got Mother a job in a kitchen in some resort, you know, in some factory. And Mother started to work.

So we waited longer, longer, til it cleared, til it was to -- completely quiet and got 8 dark. And started to listen what\u2019s going on on this side. And we heard voices. We heard voices, and we heard a language -- a Slavic language but could not distinguish. It was not Polish, but we knew that 1-in Germany there were many workers -- farm workers taken from Russia, from Ukrainia, from Belarus. So that all could be there. So after we got some reasonably time, we said, oh we have to go and see who is there. So we went and opened the door, and say hello, and happy to see you, and there were few women and few men sitting around. And they don\u2019t look very favorably at us. And they say -- they -- they didn\u2019t say anything, they knew who we are. Shaved heads, you know, schmates on us. So we say, yes we just run away from the -- from the march, and we ask for help, kindly. You are Jews. Get out of here. Okay. There was no way to discuss an answer like that coming from the group. So we left, and we were in the -- you know, on the outside again, and what to do? Well -- and they also said there are Germans in the village, and they will catch you. So we thought they may be right, they don\u2019t have to be right. Our thinking was clear, you know, in all that, the thinking was clear. So we look around, and started to explore slowly. And what we see on the street in the middle of the road, many dead German soldiers, okay, with guts spilling out, and -- there was a fight, there was a battle, and left the Germans behind, so they are -- the Russians are probably advanced beyond that village. That would be then to the east, and the Russians would be going west. So finally we see a house on a little hill, so we go out there. We\u2019re looking now for shelter. And we see the door is locked, but the key 1s hanging on the left hi -- side of the door. The family left the key so when they come back they open the door again, okay? Evacuees. So we opened the door and farn -- found a well supplied household, and food and wood and coal, you know, to heat and to eat and get sick from overeating. And we made ourself at home there. And y -- cured our stomach eventually by, you know, getting to some normal eating. And then what do we do? It\u2019s quiet, nobody moves. The 9 next few days we were explore the village slowly, seeing if somebody is there or not, and we didn\u2019t find anybody so we were just, you know, nursing ourselves. It was warm and clean, and clean linen, and clean clothing, it was paradise. A German paradise. We can laugh now, huh?"

We could oversee the road, the main road, east west, and we say who -- it\u2019s a army we hear, who can it be? Either Germans or Russians. We didn\u2019t dare to move, but eventually we say we have to see who it is. So we were slowly walking down that hill and looking and trying to find who they are, and what we saw was a lot of white. A lot of white horses, white, little horses. Soldiers on the horses are marching in white, and white hats and white fur. I say, well it looks like Siberia, you know, snow. So that -- perhaps they are Russian. So we go closer, eventually, and then we had no doubt they are Russians, you know? Because -- indeed, you know, the white hats and white thing and white horses. Everything to camouflage in Siberia, but that was winter, so that served everywhere in that part of Europe. And we see, you know, officers on horses along the marchers and we say, well, let\u2019s take a chance, let\u2019s go and talk to the officers. So we approach couple officers and we threw ourself in their arms and say, thank God, you are saving us, you know that? Well, they were glad to hear that, you know. They- you know.

Two, three days 0 pass, and then we see a bunch of young women marching 1n the direction of our house, because our house was lit.

So they come closer, and we say, what happened to you? And they say, well, we were raped by the Russian army. And they are coming here, too.

The big powers organized DP camps, displaced people camps, in which they put Jews, and Jews were in those camps for five, six years, cause nobody wanted to give them a visa, okay?

So I enrolled in school, the university opened in Frankfurt [indecipherable] in medical faculty, and I enrolled, and I could do it because German government paid for tuition, it was the beginning of reparations for -- you know, for Jews after the war.

And then I realized that I -- you know, I had a lot -- my practice was mainly women -- women and children, very few men. Family, so the husband would come and so on, but mainly women. And I was taken aback by observing how many women suffered from depression, deep depression. And that was a well- to-do suburb of Cincinnati, where families were ma -- mainly coming to work with Cincinnati with General Motors, Ford company, PNG. So they were -- the husband were -- had good jobs. The wives were taking care of the house and children, and I would see them in my office, and they would come with all kinds of physical symptoms. And we did the work and nothing showed. So I would have to tell them that I could not find anything else, so I don\u2019t know why you -- why you hurt here and there. And try to sort of enlarge the questioning, what and how. I was doing a lot of house calls, not because I was so generous, but maybe I wanted -- I was used to house calls back home. But I wanted to get to know the country I am living in, and that was a very good way to do it, to see people\u2019s homes, and how they lived. So I know the ones -- one thing I knew that was very stressful, and that was the big companies were promoting people, but you paid a price for it. The promotion would come and you had to move to another part of the 9 country. If you get the promotion in Cincinnati, you would be sent to the west coast, and from the west coast you would be sent to Cincinnati. So the family was always in a turmoil, having to live with the idea that every two years you have to move, if you want to move up the ladder. And it was the wife that had to put in roots quickly, school, church, neighborhood. I knew that that was a chore, but they were always sen -- saying that they are treated well -- they are treated well. The husband really didn\u2019t move. He was still in the circles of national commerce, or productivity. But the wife had to change totally her surrounding, and make it easy for the husband. So I know -- knew that, but beyond that I didn\u2019t know. And I had friends, they were either in training of psychiatry, or psychiatrists, and they told me about it, and what -- and I didn\u2019t know anything about Freudian psychiatry in Germany. We were learning psychiatry, you know, but not about Freud. So, you know, the dynamic psychiatry, it was fresh to me, and it was exciting, so I said, I ka -- I have to do it. That\u2019s -- I went into training."
