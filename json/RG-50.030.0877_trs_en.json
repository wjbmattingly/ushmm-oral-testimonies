Q2: The museum recently acquired the research collection of Leonard and Edith Ehrlich, two survivors from Vienna, who spend a good 40 years researching the history of the Jewish community Vienna during the Holocaust. And having emigrated to the United States, they spent many years interviewing survivors from Vienna who were in the United States. And those survivors, and these interviews were done in the 1970s, so the survivors whom they interviewed were often individuals who had a role within the administration of the Jewish community Vienna. The research collection includes dozens of these audio cassette tapes, Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herta Baitch ** May 10\", 2016 which the museum only recently digitized, and we still have not gone through all of the cassette tapes, but we started to do so just only recently, and we came across one interview that was conducted in December 27\", 1974, in New York, in the office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and it is an interview with Margaret Feiler, the name who \u2014 who you will recognize.

The community intended to send, I think it was two social workers, who also wanted to emigrate, who had the affidavits, sent them with the children to the United States. They all required for visa around August \u2014 September. And of the children, only nine got visas, for reasons which we never knew. And none of the two social workers got visa.

Well, I didn\u2019t know what [indecipherable], but there was a so-called democratic [indecipherable] which I think [indecipherable] in all of \u2014 of Vienna. Well, it was a hopeless affair. It was somebody who really \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t think why anybody would spend money on something like that, but it was idealism. Now don\u2019t ask me whether I quor \u2014 voted for that, because I won\u2019t admit anything. But when I was asked, that\u2019s what I said. And all I can tell you is that I got the visa. I: [inaudible] M: That\u2019s \u2014 that was my [indecipherable]. So anyway, I got the visa, and when I came for the examination, you know, you had a medical examination, this is the second point for the American consulate [indecipherable] whatever you want to say, they asked me two questions. One said \u2014 one question was, what is your true hair color \u2014 implying that it was dyed, which it never was, and the second was, in what month are you [indecipherable] I; It was what? M: In what month are you [indecipherable]. These were the two questions. So \u2014I mean, you can imagine the atmosphere, this was the atmosphere. So anyway, I got the visa in October, I got the \u2014 I left on November 30\", I brought the children out. Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herta Baitch *\u00b0 May 10\", 2016 There are some \u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s here on file, and I don\u2019t think I have it. I had written a column for that newspaper that the community [indecipherable] was called in those days, and I wrote about how I brought back the children, and it was very interesting for the people [inaudible]. So that was the story of, in those days, of the immigration. Now, of course, this is what I know myself. Now one other thing. Murmelstein had over [indecipherable] was very anxious [indecipherable] but he also [indecipherable]. And so the only hope was that a job offer would come from the United States. And he was afraid \u2014 first of all, he didn\u2019t want to stay. [indecipherable] to stay, but I was so optimistic, he didn\u2019t want to stay. Number two, he was afraid that the more he knew, and the more he was involved with the Gestapo, they may, in the end, not let him go, not let him even survive. He was always afraid for his life. He said he\u2019s getting deeper and deeper into this, and he is not going to survive. So when I went to the United States, I promised [indecipherable] when I come here, that I would see Rabbi Young, and that I would talk to Rabbi Young, and ask him to get him a job offer as a rabbi. I: Who is Rabbi Young? M: Rabbi Young is \u2014 has a\u2014 a community, a \u2014 a \u2014 a synagogue on the west side. I can get you details from [indecipherable]. He is of German extraction. He\u2019s not a refugee, but he is \u2014 when you talk to him, you can hear he is German. That the first Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herta Baitch >\" May 10\", 2016 thing I did \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know whether it was the first week or the second week. But you see, as [indecipherable] in New Rochelle in jan \u2014 the end of January. So it must \u2014 all this was the end \u2014 the last few days in December, the first two days in January. Before I did anything, I went to Rabbi Young. I was admitted to his study, and I started to talk, and he cut me short and he said, not a word about Murmelstein. Don\u2019t mention the name to me. I know all about him. I said, now, wait a minute. I\u2019ve been working with him. Don\u2019t tell me, I know all about it. There is not a thing I\u2019m going to do, he should be happy his name isn\u2019t mentioned in the United States. And he practically threw me out, I mean it\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was polite enough to say goodbye, but you know [indecipherable]. So I wrote it. I wrote to Murmelstein about it, and this what I want to tell you, because you see, I don\u2019t know how Murmelstein behaved in Theresienstadt. I can imagine that all sorts of things happened. It could be, because the atmosphere in Theresienstadt was quite different from the atmosphere in Vienna, and I don\u2019t know what people do to survive [indecipherable]. All sorts of things can have happened. But I do know what happened when I was still in Vienna, and I know that there was nothing that he did [indecipherable] because I was [indecipherable] all night. I went home to have a shower, you know, that was it. And nevertheless, that rumor had reached already the United States, at that time.
