Q2: The museum recently acquired the research collection of Leonard and Edith Ehrlich , two survivors from Vienna , who spend a good 40 years researching the history of the Jewish community Vienna during the Holocaust. And having emigrated to the United States , they spent many years interviewing survivors from Vienna who were in the United States . And those survivors, and these interviews were done in the 1970s, so the survivors whom they interviewed were often individuals who had a role within the administration of the Jewish community Vienna . The research collection includes dozens of these audio cassette tapes, Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th, 2016 52 which the museum only recently digitized, and we still have not gone through all of the cassette tapes, but we started to do so just only recently, and we came across one interview that was conducted in December 27 th, 1974, in New York , in the office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and it is an interview with Margaret Feiler , the name who \u0152 who you will recognize. She is the only adult chaperone who was on your transport. And the interview is, all in all, it\u2122s about three hours long, and \u0152 and she recounts everything that she did for the Jewish community. And at one point in the interview, she starts to mention an American committee for children, which arranged for originally 30 children to be brought to the United States , and then in the end, eight or nine children ended up being on the transport.",
            "answer": "Oh my God. Q2: And that is the ex \u0152 the excerpt that we would like to play for you now. It\u2122s about nine minutes long. [technical problem ] [The following is from the 1974 interview with Margaret Feiler . For the full audio recording, see Oral history interview with Margaret Feiler, RG-50.862.0001, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum collection] \ufb01M: \u2013for a group of children, I think it was 30-odd children. There must be something on file on this. Probably not on this file, but she has the file. Children Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th, 2016 53 whose fathers had died in some concentration camp, either Buchenwald or Dachau , and whose mother had a quota which didn\u2122t come up; Hungarian or Romanian or Polish. Such children \u0152 they made a group of such children, of 30-odd children, and they arranged for foster parents, here in the United States . The community intended to send, I think it was two social workers, who also wanted to emigrate, who had the affidavits, sent them with the children to the United States . They all required for visa around August \u0152 September. And of the children, only nine got visas, for reasons which we never knew. And none of the two social workers got visa. And nobody else got visa, not in September. Not in August, not in September, I don\u2122t know how far back, but not in August, not in September, and not before I got my visa. Now, I started talking to anybo \u0152 I [indecipherable] when I got the visa, they asked me whether I would take those nine children, and that\u2122s what I did. And that\u2122s how JDC even paid for my fare, because I was the escort. They paid for those nine children\u2122s fare, and my own, and we came here. I went via Berlin, where I picked up the 10 th child, that also wasn\u2122t [indecipherable] and I brought them to the United States , via Lisbon . It was the first transport via Lisbon , through occupied France [indecipherable] . Now, to come back to the visa, I asked the people who had gone to the consulate, two social workers, and everybody else to whom I could talk, because most of them came to the community in order to Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th, 2016 54 communicate to their relatives here that they couldn\u2122t come because they didn\u2122t get the vi \u0152 the visa. I asked them, what were you asked, because they were asked questions. And there was one thing that they all had in common, all of them. There must have been 20 people. They had been asked how they had voted in the last election, in the last free election that Austria had, which was some time in spring \u0152 I don\u2122t know when it was. The last thing \u0152 I asked that question, how \u0152 I: Is that before or \u0152 before \u0152 M: Before Hitler. I: 1934? M: Right. I: There was not election \u0152 M: No, no, no, no, no, we had elections to \u0152 I: Was there election between \u212234 and \u212238? M: Oh yes, yes, there was. Was [indecipherable] But they have asked them \u0152 I can\u2122t re \u0152 I can\u2122t really tell you what year it was, because I know only the question. But they asked, how did you vote during the last three elections? And all of them, every one of them had said, either a social democrat or a Christian socialist. Well, there was no other party. Very few said Christian socialist, but I know that the very few who had said that, and one had said social democrat. None of them had gotten a Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th, 2016 55 visa. And the other questions, I didn\u2122t find any other question that could be [indecipherable] . So I started thinking. And I was asked the same question. Well, I didn\u2122t know what [indecipherable] , but there was a so-called democratic [indecipherable] which I think [indecipherable] in all of \u0152 of Vienna . Well, it was a hopeless affair. It was somebody who really \u0152 I can\u2122t \u0152 I can\u2122t think why anybody would spend money on something like that, but it was idealism. Now don\u2122t ask me whether I quor \u0152 voted for that, because I won\u2122t admit anything. But when I was asked, that\u2122s what I said. And all I can tell you is that I got the visa. I: [inaudible] M: That\u2122s \u0152 that was my [indecipherable] . So anyway, I got the visa, and when I came for the examination, you know, you had a medical examination, this is the second point for the American consulate [indecipherable] whatever you want to say, they asked me two questions. One said \u0152 one question was, what is your true hair color \u0152 implying that it was dyed, which it never was, and the second was, in what month are you [indecipherable] I: It was what? M: In what month are you [indecipherable] . These were the two questions. So \u0152 I mean, you can imagine the atmosphere, this was the atmosphere. So anyway, I got the visa in October, I got the \u0152 I left on November 30 th, I brought the children out. Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th, 2016 56 There are some \u0152 I don\u2122t think it\u2122s here on file, and I don\u2122t think I have it. I had written a column for that newspaper that the community [indecipherable] was called in those days, and I wrote about how I brought back the children, and it was very interesting for the people [inaudible] . So that was the story of, in those days, of the immigration . Now, of course, this is what I know myself. Now one other thing. Murmelstein had over [indecipherable] was very anxious [indecipherable] but he also [indecipherable] . And so the only hope was that a job offer would come from the United States . And he was afraid \u0152 first of all, he didn\u2122t want to stay. [indecipherable] to stay, but I was so optimistic, he didn\u2122t want to stay. Number two, he was afraid that the more he knew, and the more he was involved with the Gestapo, they may, in the end, not let him go, not let him even survive. He was always afraid for his life. He said he\u2122s getting deeper and deeper into this, and he is not going to survive. So when I went to the United States , I promised [indecipherable] when I come here, that I would see Rabbi Young , and that I would talk to Rabbi Young , and ask him to get him a job offer as a rabbi. I: Who is Rabbi Young ? M: Rabbi Young is \u0152 has a \u0152 a community, a \u0152 a \u0152 a synagogue on the west side. I can get you details from [indecipherable] . He is of German extraction. He\u2122s not a refugee, but he is \u0152 when you talk to him, you can hear he is German. That the first Interview with Herta Baitch May 10 th, 2016 57 thing I did \u0152 I \u0152 I don\u2122t know whether it was the first week or the second week. But you see, as [indecipherable] in New Rochelle in jan \u0152 the end of January. So it must \u0152 all this was the end \u0152 the last few days in December, the first two days in January. Before I did anything, I went to Rabbi Young . I was admitted to his study, and I started to talk, and he cut me short and he said, not a word about Mur me lstein. Don\u2122t mention the name to me. I know all about him. I said, now, wait a minute. I\u2122ve been working with him. Don\u2122t tell me, I know all about it. There is not a thing I\u2122m going to do, he should be happy his name isn\u2122t mentioned in the United States .
