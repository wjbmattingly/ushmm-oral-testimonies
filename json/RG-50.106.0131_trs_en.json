It -- 1t\u2019s unusual, I think for the Jews to possess land, right, in Latvia. So they considered themselves more or less well -- well off, right? And so my mother actually, since her childhood, she worked in the farm and worked in the store and worked in the office, keep the book -- bookkeeping with her sister and older brother. Her older brother went to Daugavpils and then became a -- a -- a businessman. And she and her older sister and their mother, they -- they ran the st -- the business. And my -- on my father\u2019s side, my father was a blacksmith and so they were poorer, much poorer. And my -- you see, my mother was a foo -- of the so called -- maybe they considered themself intelligentsia or something. So she married late, because she was very choosy, I think. So -- but she realized that my father was a good man and had a -- a head on his shoulders, so I guess it\u2019s how - what happened."

And I wouldn\u2019t say I can say for sure that they were bombing us at this particular time, but I am sure that the train was the last one to leave Riga. I can\u2019t say the date, but this was the last train. And I was -- sat in the train, it was a mixed train of civilians and military.

We boarded our train back and it turned out that the last three cars, railroad cars, they were blown apart, and my mama to -- mama told me that about 40 people died in the train.

I'll call it -- my mother\u2019s uncle had seven kids -- seven children. Their name was Kuperschmidt and then the -- they remained in Riga with all -- with all seven kids and ob- obviously they were killed. And my grandfather remained in his town Barovka and he was shot. My mother\u2019s sister, her name was Dwara. In Russian they used to call her Vera. She was kept alive with her son, as my mother told me, for awhile, because she was a translator for the Germans, translated from German into Latvian and Russian, I know this. And my ol -- uncle, with his wife -- yeah, ma -- my -- my aunt, she was married in 1935 or \u201936 and her to a person named Opanansky, who was Sa -- later in Soviet army, and he was killed in action. And she -- she had the small child, two years old, so was -- she was killed in -- with the small child, two Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Michael Lin . February 27, 2000 year old male. And my u-uncle, he was shot in the -- in the fortress of Daugavpils with his wife and the three year old too -- male child. And then I had the -- my grandmother\u2019s sister, on my mother\u2019s side, sh-she -- she didn\u2019t have her own kids, but she -- she married to a person who had his own four. But two of them escaped. One of them actually, a woman, I don\u2019t remember her name, she was a communist. And in 1937 the -- she was caught by Latvian police and probably worked over good in the prison. And then they probably released her and she went to Russia. But you know what happened in Russia in 1937. So they -- they grabbed her and sent her to Magadan. She got married in Magadan, f-far eastern Pacific Ocean, she got married. And I saw her in 1957, she had a son. And sh-she spent 20 years in Magadan, from \u201937 to *57, it was precisely when I came from the army and I saw her. It was strange that she never blamed the communists for her misfortunes, which was very strange. And my grandmother\u2019s si-sister, as I mentioned, they were business people, dealt in lumber and had properties and houses in Daugavpils, so everything gone.
