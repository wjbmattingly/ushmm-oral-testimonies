And he was going to their -- to the -- to their building and one day he comes in and -- and one day he comes in there, and a Russian prisoner says, doc, I gotta tell you a secret, but don\u2019t you dare tell -- tell that I told you. And he says, well, what\u2019s that secret? He says they\u2019re digging graves in Cusack and in a day or two they\u2019re gonna have liquidation for the ghetto. So he came to the ghetto and he says, in Jewish, kinderloch, run, because so and so and whatever. So my parents heard that and they -- they had a Ukraine family that they had no children, and they said -- my parents gave them money, gold, and whatever, jewelry, and they promised that they gonna save me and my older brother. And my mother and dad said that we should go there. And I said, no, I\u2019m not going. If they going to kill you, I\u2019m not going. I\u2019m staying here. And well, when my mother said something like that, I ignored her, but when the da -- when my dad said something, it meant business. And she started to pack for me that we are leaving. And I says, if I go, I am not taking nothing, and I\u2019m not going. And they said, no, we made arrangements, and you and your brother are gonna go there, and she\u2019s gonna save us. And well, I said, I guess we have to go. And it got dark, it got maybe eight o\u2019clock, nine o\u2019clock, I\u2019m not sure, and we ran out from the ghetto. The ghetto was not wired, you can go. And we heard shooting. Somebody was shooting, and we hid under a bush. And then there was a -- I remember, was a -- like a -- not a -- pond, or what, and you had to cross that in order to run away, and we jumped over there, and I was 10 years old, 11 years old, I didn't know how to swim, and my brother pulled me out by my hair, and we -- he was a -- a man, a boy, and he stronger than I am, he knew how to swim, and he saved me. And we ran over that water, or whatever, I di -- I can\u2019t tell you what it was. And we were hiding under that bush. And we went, we ran. It took us more than an hour, two hours to get to that -- to those people. And we came and it was already 10 o\u2019clock. We knocked in the door, and we said, we came to you, and we didn\u2019t say nothing, killing or whatever. And she said, oh my God, oh my God. And she said - we Said, we like to stay here for a day or two. And she says, oh, okay, then you can go in the barn and hi -- and sleep there. And we did. And in the morning she came, and she says, I heard that they killed already, everybody in Koretz. It\u2019s -- everybody\u2019s killed. And -- and we started to cry, and we knew that that\u2019s it, they killed our parents and the two brothers. And every morning she would come in and tell us that we must leave because they gonna find out that she is hiding Jews, then they gonna kill her. And that was every morning. And she would bring us a piece of bread and a glass of milk. And anyway, I told my brother, I\u2019m leaving. I can\u2019t stay here. And he says, well, there\u2019s nothing we can do. And I wa -- in the morning, I got up, and I says, I\u2019m going. Because she would come in and she said we must leave. And I said good-bye and I walk out from that barn, and I didn\u2019t know where to go, because we were border with Russia, and that was Russia til 1939, and we were Ukraine Poland. And I -- I says, what do I do? Where do I go? And I went the other way, where Ukraine. And I walked and walked, and where I\u2019m going, I don\u2019t know. I walked for a couple hours, and I saw two men working on field. And I walked over, and I told them, my name is Manya, and I\u2019m from a village, and I have no mother. My mother died, and my dad remarried, and I have a stepmother and she doesn\u2019t want me, and I\u2019m looking for to be a maid. Maybe you know who needs a maid. And he says to me, aren\u2019t you Jewish? And I says no, I\u2019m not. And he says, well, if you wait an hour or so til I finish my work, I think my neighbor may hire you. I said okay. Didn\u2019t eat nothing, nervous, scared, don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen. And he went into the house and he wrote the address, and made a little map for me. And he says, go there, he is my neighbor, he might hire you. And I did follow the map. Where I\u2019m going I don\u2019t know, but finally I did find th-there, the neighbor. And it was kind of dark. I came in, I knock on the door, and I show him the na -- the piece of paper, and he says to me, aren\u2019t you Jewish? And I said, no, I\u2019m not. And she says, well, what can you do? What do you want to get paid? I said, a piece of bread. And she said, what can you do? And I says, try me. And she says, okay. And I stayed there. Every day, are you Jewish, are you -- your mother was Jewish? I said no, not at all. And I worked very hard. Very, very hard to please, and I didn\u2019t know from one day to the other day if Pll survive. And -- and that\u2019s about all. I stayed there til the Russian liberated us."
