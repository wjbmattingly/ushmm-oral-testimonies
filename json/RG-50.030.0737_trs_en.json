You know, I \u2014 they were talking about it. Pilsudski had a very hard life because his sister used to come and sit in my grandfather\u2019s house. On the deck there were flowers. Oh, it was so beautiful over there, You cannot imagine how many flowers, agave, you know, was growing, and everything. Palms, little. And sh-she was talking and she was saying that you know, when you are in the government like my brother is, they print special papers for him. He cannot even get the news. I can tell you what\u2019s going on in the country, but they \u2014 other groups, you know, they surround you. They are like plague, you don\u2019t know. You have advisors, I guess in every government it\u2019s the same thing, you know, they \u2014 th-they \u2014 they \u2014 they do everything. But she was saying that it\u2019s a famous building in Warsaw, dom bez kantow. Kant means a corner, but 1t also means without cheating. So they said when they were building this building, they came to Pilsudski and said, well, build one building bez kantow. Build one building without cheating, you know. And they cut off the corner, it\u2019s said to this day you Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski ~ June 20, 2014 can go on computer and you write dom bez kantow and they show it in Warsaw, the home. And this became famous dom bez kantow. So you know, it\u2019s not easy to be a ruler."

They \u2014 once you go to Siberia you saw all kinds of people, Germans, Ukrainians, they used to call [indecipherable], T'artars from Crimea they were deporting over there. They were deporting people for years. This is one procedure in Russia, take people and send them to Siberia, it\u2019s empty. You know, you were going for days on, and you hardly Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski * June 20, 2014 saw a little station, where they only had water and maybe some coal for the railroad, and the train. It was a \u2014 it\u2019s like ano man\u2019s land, you go and go and there\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s a disaster. And then, in some places they build like [indecipherable] the soil was very good, you know. But this was funny. I\u2019Il tell you something; we were there, I never saw a rabbit, I never saw a fox, I never saw any animal alive or dead. Whether they ate them when they were starving, when there was starvation in the [indecipherable] you know, or \u2014 or what, I don\u2019t know. Because I was fr \u2014 with a friend Fruzhinski(ph) later in India and he was working in sulfur mine and there was a lot of gold. And the mine, being broken, pressed his chest in. He couldn\u2019t be 1n the army, you know, he had a hole \u2014 hole in there. And he said that that mine, all the Russians were laughing because Americans came in the 30s, engineers, and they developed that mine. And he said, how stupid Americans are. Don\u2019t \u2014 Russians were saying, don\u2019t they know how secretive Russians are? Of course they had an accident and they buried them over there. Once the mine was open [indecipherable] America the worst place in Russia, gold mine, and the worst concentration camp, where if you lasted two years you were lucky, they \u2014 you froze, it\u2019s na \u2014 close to Alaska. That was be \u2014 opened up with American help. How about [indecipherable], the city Volga(ph)? Volga(ph) was built by all this \u2014 a fort. So you know, America did all the business they could, Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski *\u00b0 June 20, 2014 and they say Russia was starving its people, selling its food and trying to get machinery and everything from America. And America did business with them, capitalists, what do they care? They don\u2019t care whether hundred million people died. To hell, as long as I make my million, that\u2019s my opinion. I don\u2019t know whether I should say that, but as long as you can make money, it\u2019s all right. You see, brokerage houses, when I started, were private companies, they were partnership. And if they were doing business, they were very, very afraid. If they made something wrong, it was their pocket. And then they allowed them to become corporation. So now people who run corporation can steal, make themselves rich, and if they get punish, who pays the stockholder? The stockholders are punished, and they lose the money."
