They \u0152 once you go to Siberia you saw all kinds of people, German s, Ukrainians, they used to call [indecipherable] , Tartars from Crimea they were deporting ov er there. They were deporting people for years. This is one procedure in Russia , take people and send them to Siberia, it\u2122s empty. You know, you were going for days on, and you hardly Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20, 2014 55saw a little station, where they only had water and maybe some coal for the railroad, and the train. It was a \u0152 it\u2122s like a no man\u2122s land, you go and go and there\u2122s nothing. It\u2122s a disaster. And th en, in some places they build like [indecipherable] the soil was very good, you know. But this was funny. I\u2122ll tell you something; we were there, I never sa w a rabbit, I never saw a fox, I never saw any animal alive or dead. Whether they ate them when they were starving, when there was starvation in the [indecipherable] you know, or \u0152 or what, I don\u2122t know. Because I was fr \u0152 with a friend Fruzhinski (ph) later in India and he was working in sulfur mine and there was a lot of gold. And the mine, being broken, pressed his chest in. He couldn\u2122t be in the army, you know, he had a hole \u0152 hole in there. And he said that that mine, all the Russians were laughing because Americans came in the 30s, engineers, and they develope d that mine. And he said, how stupid Americans are. Don\u2122t \u0152 Russians were saying, don\u2122t they know how secretive Russians are? Of course they had an accident and they buried them over there. Once the mine was open [indecipherable] America the worst place in Russia, gold mine, and the worst concentration ca mp, where if you lasted two years you were lucky, they \u0152 you froze, it\u2122s na \u0152 close to Alaska. That was be \u0152 opened up with American help. How about [indecipherable] , the city Volga (ph)? Volga (ph) was built by all this \u0152 a fort. So you know, America did all the business they could, Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20, 2014 56and they say Russia was starving its people, selling its food and trying to get machinery and everything from America. And America did business with them, capitalists, what do they care? They don\u2122t care whether hundred million people died. To hell, as long as I make my m illion, that\u2122s my opinion. I don\u2122t know whether I should say that, but as long as you can make money, it\u2122s all right. You see, brokerage houses, when I started, were private companies, they were partnership. And if they were doing business, they were very, very afraid. If they made something wrong, it was their pocket. And then they allowe d them to become corporation. So now people who run corpor ation can steal, make themselves rich, and if they get punish, who pays the st ockholder? The stockholders are punished, and they lose the money."

But he knew him from first World War, because I think after the first World War, Hoover sent money to newly resurrected Poland , and somehow he must have been involved in that money. Because I remember that my father became a mayor of a small town where my sister was born. Actually \u0152 wait, what\u2122s its name, you see \u0152 and over there, my father received money to give to people who have trouble. So my fa ther knew some Polish people. He didn\u2122t know the Jewish community well, and he we nt to a rabbi. And my father said to a rabbi, give me the name of the Jewish peopl e that need financially help, because we got some money from the government, and we can help. And \u0152 and the rabbi gave him the names, and my father said, well, I know this fellow, he needs help, this guy. And the rabbi said no, they are healthy, they can work. Only give to them that are sick. Don\u2122t give to the people that are we \u0152 healthy, because they will stop working. My father was always telling me. So, you know, there was some help for people \u0152"

There were people telling me, you stupid going to school. I said, oh yes, I\u2122m stupid. I had a gi rlfriend, very nice, and she told me, you stupid going to NYU. I said, well, but I\u2122m going to study, and I\u2122m going to finish Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20, 2014 163this school. And you know, there were a lot of things in life, and you always look for something. And I had one big objective, that I had my father who told me, take care of your mother and your sister. And I took care of them. My sister died in 2001, you know, and to the last day I alwa ys took care of her, and I did everything that I could to help my sister, my mother. And you know, my cousin, responsibility for that. And also, in my life, it was funny, but I took care of other people. I was \u0152 we were drafted into American army, and there was a Ukrainian fellow sleeping about me, and he started comp laining that he has stomachache. So I said, give me your knee. I pulled his knee, oh, appendicitis. So I ran to the company headquarters and I said, get me an ambulance quickly, we have to take this fellow for operation. They told me, who do you know, what do you know, you think you stupid or something, he\u2122s goldbricking. So I went back, I waited 15 - 20 minutes, I came back. You know, we\u2122re going to sue you if he dies. He may die soon. They called ambulance, straight from the barrack on the operating table, it was appendicitis. There was a fellow in Korea, and he used to stand and bu rn his legs, and I realized that he was so depressed, that he didn\u2122t pain, because we had those Coleman stoves. So, how to help him? He had very thick glasses. So I said, put your thick glasses right next to your bag, and in th e morning step on them and crush them. And he crushed them. Doctors didn\u2122t pa y attention, nobody. They send him to Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20, 2014 164Japan , and of course he was sent back home. He was a mental case, you know. Look at my wife.

I tell you like in Karachi, we were \u0152 there was a club for British soldiers and diving and everything. I got to know the Canadian fellow who Interview with Stanley Kiersnowski June 20, 2014 166was running. We used to steal Indian boats and go sailing, the two of us together.

I told you in American Red Cross I made contacts with those soldiers, and I have everythi ng. So I always had some money, you know, for these things. Then I ran photography, and I started making money on photography. You constantly had to fi gure out something. When I came to America I had no money, so I took a course in radio and television, I started learning how to do. And you know, and then I didn\u2122t finish it because I went to Korea. But I le \u0152 I learned so much about electricity that \u0152 you have to ask people, and you have to talk to people so much, because you learn something from everybody.
