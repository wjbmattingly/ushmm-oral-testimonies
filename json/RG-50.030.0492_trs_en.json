But we had as many as 20 boys in that house, you see, and on the first floor was a sort of a big room with a theater and so on, where the boys could at least take some exercise. And then, on the top there were his office and so on. And the boys actually lived in that house, you see, for -- they could not go out, right? And -- and that\u2019s the reason why he got in touch with me, because we wanted to, you know, on Sunday -- on Saturdays and Sundays, well mostly on Sundays, I suppose, we gathered, you know, neighborhood boys and so on, right, and then the Jewish children joined them and so -- so they could get some exercise and fresh air."
