When the Hungarian people came, these last transports of this brick factory, it was called the sigamnalaager, gypsy lager. The number of the lager was called 32C. Later, I learned that the gypsy people were living there with family. It was a family lager. They killed them before the Hungarian Jews were brought there because they needed the place. Very few gypsies who were in Auschwitz survived Auschwitz. Most of them were killed at that time. We came there and the second day or the third day, we were newcomers. We were very stupid. We didn\u2019t know the regulations. For instance, we got some bread. Then people were coming and telling if you give me a piece of bread, I give you this pot and you can eat from this pot. One of my friends bought a pot to have a pot from barrack. Later on came, not the Germans, Port, \u2018toot\u2019 and then came another one and took it away because it was not allowed to have the pot. The pots were distributed before getting the food and then it was collected again. You couldn\u2019t own a pot and the people who sold the pot for bread knew it but she was hungry. Morika, that was Morika. We were stupid and I don\u2019t know, somehow, they arranged a transport from Yangers and we were standing there and one person was missing. I think one person was running away from this transport and they needed somebody. We were standing there with mother and they just took me and pushed me in this transport and we were separated. If I were not so stupid, some days later, I would run away again but I didn\u2019t run away. That was the transport, I was separated from mother. Then they took us to the next lager, took we to be which had only the wire, which was separated with this electrical wire from the other one where mother remained. I was there. I sleep and I heard they wanted to send for work, these transports. But it turned out that somebody had scarlet. Scarlet fever from these transports. So they stopped all the transports and we had to remain there. So mother was here and I was there. I could speak to her. It was not so easy but I have spoken to her every day, but in the very early morning because there were these towers in Auschwitz and in every tower was a German, an SS. If he thought that at the wire, there are too many people, he shot. I have seen with my eyes two girls who were shot. One was speaking with her sister who was on the other side and one was speaking with her mother. I have seen two girls who were shot."

You had to stay there all the day, not to see. But somehow, --. I remember when they brought new people. For instance, from Slovakia, they first, as ve told you, only the girls were taken away. The unmarried girls. For instance, one, a cousin of mine who used to live there was taken because she was unmarried but two others who were married could stay there. They were taken later on in September from Slovakia to Auschwitz. I remember when they brought this transport, when the transport was coming and how few people could enter the lager. Maybe, I don\u2019t know how many they brought. After my mother, because a sister of my mother used to live in Yeetro and the whole family. I told mother that they were brought, I have spoken to people who entered the lager and so I knew that they were taken and that nobody among them, entered the lager. I remember that I told mother that your sister came and her family, her two daughters and husbands, and grandchildren and nobody entered the lager."

That was the whole transport. It was the oldest part and all the circumstances were much worse. It was Ausenkommando, I told you, we had to work. We had to dig potatoes inthe pun __\u2014\u2014_\u2014\u00ab.~ We had to put potatoes in heaps and cover with earth. It was raining, everything was wet; all the potatoes got rotten. One day we were -- and it was a very heavy work because you had to carry it across; it was a hard work. You had to carry the potatoes. One day it was put there, the other day we had to remove them from there. It was silly work only it was very, very difficult, very hard work. In this potato, I got ill very soon. I was not so strong any more. I never was a strong person and I got ill. In the meantime, the evacuation of the camp was continued and we were taken from this old part of this lager back to where I used to be, back to this relatively new part, this B2B where I have known all the physicians. Them I felt ill and I was ill and I sent to these physicians whom I knew and they put me in this rever , you know what arever __ is, it was a small hospital where ill people could stay as long as they were not selected. At that time, the selection was not as bad any more. After they knew the crematorium didn\u2019t work.

Ihad one only ___ to sleep, underwear. I hated it, you can imagine. I hated it, it was so --. I have worn it day and day and day after this one only thing. We were there and I thought -- I washed it and it was wet. We went to sleep and the wet underwear was somewhere there. It was stolen. So it was November and I had to stay the opel and I had no underwear. Even today, I am very sensitive. I got cold, you notice, the weather and even today I suffer with it. Then, it was some days I was walking without this underwear and then we went somewhere there was a bath, where there was warm water and you could take a bath, there and somehow there, we manages to buy for me, I was with a friend together -- I always looked for a friend to have somebody, not to be alone -- and this was a very good friend of mine. We went there and we bought for a bread because we had, in this work, in this potato work, we got more bread than usual. We had bread and we bought for me underwear, warm underwear for one bread. We put together our -- and then I had it. I remember it was such a cold, I got such a bad cold, because to stay out as long without underwear, that I had diarrhea and I had to urinate always, I was really ill. It was while we were standing in the opel and I found that I must go up. I told Markget, Pl sit down and I'll manage my work. She began to cry, Eva don\u2019t do it. If the German will see you, what you are doing, she will kill you. She will hit you, beat you until you are dead. I told her, I can\u2019t help, I must. I had the chance, I was not seen. It was dark already and so I could manage it. I felt that I must do it because otherwise -- it was stupidity because standing is possible --but I hated it. To get dirty."

Then the physicians who knew me took me to the revier, to the small hospital. But I missed you a very important -- I missed a very important detail of the potato. In this potato field, we worked together, Ukrainian girls who were from the countryside, who were big and strong and for whom this work was nothing special. We used to live in the same block together with them. They were very, very rude with us. In the morning they took -- in Auschwitz you are not allowed to drink water, there is no drinking there, many people died because they drank this water and typhus, I don\u2019t know what and died in diarrhea. They took the -- in the morning they brought tea. It was not tea but it was something but it was boiled water. They took this hot water and they washed themselves in it. We remained, we didn\u2019t get anything to drink in the morning, so they were so rude. We had to go to the kitchen and steal tea which is a stupidity to steal boiled water but we had to drink something. If the German see us, that we are stealing the tea from the kitchen, it would be a bad story. We had to do it because we knew we have to drink and we are not allowed to drink the water. That was our drink for the whole day. Then they carried a big -- these Ukrainian girls , they were strong -- and they carried many potatoes. We can\u2019t keep up with potatoes in this carriage. She told the German officer, look, the Jew has so few potatoes and I am carrying so much. We managed to escape somehow from the German that she couldn\u2019t observe that we are carrying a few, only on the bottom of this thing. But she told the German, look what they are doing. Then we got hit. We were beaten, They were really very, very -- [\u201cSo they were not Jewish\u201d] No, no. They were from the countryside. I can\u2019t help but these are my memories from the Ukrainian girls. They were even worse than the Germans with us. That was the end of my working career in Auschwitz, when I got to this revier. I don\u2019t know why, I could do eel and eel. I couldn\u2019t recall why."

On the 27\" when the cannon, in the morning everything it was silence, stopped, the cannon stopped and everything stopped. At noon, the first Russian soldiers arrived to the camp. They were wearing this white gown, it was winter. At twelve o\u2019clock, I went to bring some coal to heat this, because it was a long, long oven along the whole barrack which could be heated. It was not warm but it was not ice cold in the barrack and we could heat it some of. We went to bring fuel and then we have seen the first two soldiers who were coming. That was the first camp where they found living people. People who were alive. They passed already, the Russian army, passed already Treblinka and Majdanek and nobody was there alive. It turned our that Auschwitz was undermanned too but I had no time anymore to do anything. They just run away, the Wehrmacht army never came to the camp who were fighting back. The SS run away and the Wehrmacht didn\u2019t come. In the afternoon came a high ranking officer, a Russian officer, early afternoon. He went in every barrack, it was only two parts of Birkenau. He told us that this is a surprise for them; that they can find here people who are living. They are not prepared for that. They can\u2019t give to eat anything else but tea and sweet. That they bring as much as we want and he will promise that in five days we will have everything to eat. That was our chance. Because these ill people who were starved, that they couldn\u2019t eat anything else but tea and sweet, that was the best solution for them. American and English soldiers made a big fault when, for instance in Bergen-Belsen, the English people gave food, rich food for these people. We know it because a cousin of his was there and many people died because of the rich food. Here in Auschwitz everybody had to eat because they had nothing. But in two days, we got food already, not in five, in two days they could give us food. Then they took everybody from Birkenau to the main lager where the barracks were bleak. It was an old soldier camp from the Polish army, the main camp in Auschwitz. Everybody was taken there from these wooden barracks/ Everybody was -- it was a military hospital for at least ill people. Sorry to say, there were many people who died later on because they were so ill, that they couldn\u2019t be cured. I must say that maybe they had not the best and the most up-to-date medication, but they were very, very careful. I got the best treatment, the best care. I thought and I am -- and then afterwards I went down. You were elevated. They didn\u2019t have to keep me anymore and I was very, very ill. When I went in my -- four people were very III afterwards and I was one of them. I was 27 kilos that was the lowest weight because I couldn\u2019t eat. I got more to eat and better there than anybody else. They couldn\u2019t eat it. I got every day an egg and milk, it didn\u2019t help me. What was the most important, I got a weight gain. Somebody had to sit beside me, beside my bed all the night and to tell the physician if I don\u2019t feel well. Somebody helped me, to call the physician. One night, I was really very ill. I remember the physician was standing beside me. I don\u2019t remember when I lost consciousness but I remember that the physician stood beside me and was feeling,my pulse and asking me do you feel better now? I told her yes, now I feel better. Because in the evening, I told the person who had to sit beside me, he was a man. That I feel very bad today. I had a very bad day today. I don\u2019t know when I lost my consciousness but the doctor was there. In the morning came, it was called in Russian, a Stiab. It is a German name that it was a military staff and the head was a physician and he was a colonel and he knew everybody. That was in the night and at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, he was at my bed and asked me what happened to you, in the daytime you were not so ill. I have seen you at noon and everything was okay with you and what happened to you in the night that you were so ill? He knew everybody and he visited and from that time, I remember, that several times at midnight, I awake that he 1s standing at my bed and feeling my pulse, my heart rate.

I went to the council, to a high- ranking officer in Ka___ I know who he was. I was told if I give him sum, I can leave the camp. He will give me document and I can go wherever I want but I have no money. He told me if I go, that the paper that you have is nothing. If I go to the Russian people, I can get the same paper from them. It is nothing like you have. I was very angry. I decided that I will go to the State Department in Russian. I have to find somebody who will believe me, that I am Hungarian and a Jew and I have to go home. From Ka ___, the Red Cross gave me fare, the , to go to Russia. I went to the State Department and I went and I found somebody who was responsible for the east European countries. I told him that I am an Hungarian and he answered me Hungarian. It turned out that during the war he was in Hungary and he had a Hungarian wife. He spoke Hungarian and then he told me that he will arrange me. He began to call everybody and he told me that he will arrange for me permission to leave the country. I will get it from him but I have to come back in ten days because he tried to arrange it at once but it doesn\u2019t work. He needs time and I should return in ten days. I went back to Ka___ I was living there at the Red Cross. They had such a house there. In ten days, I went again to Russia and I got this paper. Then I had to go to this country official again that he should give me the stamp on this. Then he was very nice and he told me, I told you that you need a good document and that is a good document what you have now. Now you can leave the country. So he was very polite and very nice with me. I could come home, not so easily. It was funny because it was a group of Hungarian people. The most stupid story you have ever heard. It was a family with two children and I don\u2019t know, with somebody else with two other people who had the same document what I had. A couple, it turned out that he was a Jew and she was a Christian and he was one of the men who hadn\u2019t got a Hungarian citizenship but he had a Polish citizenship. These people from Hungary were taken away in \u00b041 to somewhere, to Ukraine. They all were killed by the Germans there. Somehow, because the wife told that I don\u2019t leave him to go alone and I go with him, somehow, this very simple Christian woman, she could save his life. They came back from Ukraine with the same paper that they got somehow, the same paper what I had. I came home with this group. At the frontier, it was \u201946, the Russian officer didn\u2019t like us to enter the country. They say they will have to check who we are. We had to stay at the border; it was joined there already, this Jewish organization from here, from the state. They gave us food, they gave us where to sleep. We had to wait there. That was on the Hungarian border. I knew, somehow, these are Hungarian- speaking people who are living in this village. I spoke to somebody because in this village used to live the brother-in-law of this boy with his sister. They used to live in this village. What do you know about Mr. Mueller, this boyfriend who disappeared in Russia. I asked the people, do you know Mr. Mueller? They told yes, he\u2019s living, the wife is dead but he\u2019s still living. He is in the Hungarian part of the city which is called Est. I asked, how can I contact him, I asked this man. He told go to the riverside, that is the Danube, everybody knows him in Est__, asked the smugglers. The smuggler will take with pleasure your letter to Mueller because he is a rich man and he will give them money. If you write that you are here, he will manage somehow that you could cross the border. I did it and it happened that next day came somebody from the other side and looked for me in the joint. I told him that the check \u2014_ I\u2019m not allowed to know that he came to take me over. I should insist that I want to go and they will allow me without the permission but they will allow me to go. They will tell that they don\u2019t let me back if I can\u2019t cross the border but I should insist. The Hungarian said he will manage that I can enter the country. He came, I don\u2019t know. We told the wife that he came here. It happened like that, that I crossed the border and that the Hungarian say that I was accepted.. He waited for me already for me at the border. That is how I came home. In \u00b048 it turned out that I have -- I had relatives, and in \u201948 it turned out --. I always had some pain here and in \u201948, it turned out that itis TB. It was rather neglected as I walked with it two years long and I had to go to sanatorium and to lay for two years. Because I had it in the backbone and that was the __ treatment, now they have more medication. After coming home, I entered the university in \u201946. I had two years in the university. Then I gained a break because of this illness. That was four years and then I finished, in \u201955, I finished the university. I got excellence."
