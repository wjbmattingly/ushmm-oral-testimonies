Then he took the next one and it went through, and he started louder, was ist ein das? And then the next one, and all of it was bad, all of it was bad. How could I tell him that I just could not function? I \u2014 I \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t do RG-50.030*0584 \u201d it any more, I was so tired, and so hungry, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. So after the \u2014 after a few, he took the ammunition and with every one he knocked on my hair and screamed, was ist ein das, was ist ein das? And then he walked away to his office, which was off the machine room. After a few minutes he came back and called me. As I was walking behind him, I knew. I knew what it meant. And I could s \u2014I could see the silence of the \u2014 I could hear the silence of my fellow prisoners and I could see their tears as I was ma-marching behind him. And all I remember is thinking, what will it do to my father when he finds out that he had lost me too? I \u2014 I knew what my fate will be. I came to his office, and he looked at me and looked at me and looked at me and paused. And then he said, take the broom, sweep my office, and go back to work. I don\u2019t know if my youth moved him, if he had maybe a daughter my age. But something moved him. I also am convinced that when I was not taken in Plaszow, it was because I was small and I was standing behind somebody and they simply did not see me. Because there\u2019s absolutely no reason why I am here and my brother and others are dead. Th \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m convince of it, that they just did not see me. And it\u2019s not because of I \u2014 because I was hiding, because I wasn\u2019t. I\u2014 you know. So \u2014 so that was my other miracle, [indecipherable] that I went behind him and \u2014 and he decided, go back to work. But when my father found out, he was so worried that I will not survive this camp, because it was such horrible work, that when he \u2014 when we went to see Aunt RG-50.030*0584 \u201d Pauline, he \u2014 and she also, was terribly worried about me. So they decided that she will talk to Cuneman(ph) to move my father and me to werk A."

From newspaper clippings smuggled into the ammunition factory by a non-Jewish Belgian friend, we knew that the situation did not look good for the Germans. One evening, as we lay stretched on our plank beds, we heard sounds of shelling, gunfire and explosions. We knew that these were the sounds of the American front being so RG-50.030*0584 \u201c\" near. What sweet sounds they were. Our hopes for being soon free rose high. Unfortunately, our euphoria was very short-lived. Around nine or 10 o\u2019clock the same evening, we were ordered to assemble outside on the assembly field. I don\u2019t remember if we were told for what purpose. We were given some supply of food, and we were marched out of the camp into the darkness of the night. About 5,000 women began their new journey. A journey which became known as the death march. We marched and marched. Days replaced nights. We kept marching, given short periods of rest. We mar-marched in sunshine and we marched in the rain. We marched through towns, and we marched through villages. No one knew where we were going. Later we found out that we were walking between the American and the Russian front. While we were marching, we were heavily guarded by our captors. They were working in shifts. Replacements for them were coming on trucks. Food was delivered to them, while our was long gone. The officers among our captors were driving by in comfortable cars, enjoying the sight of marching subhuman creatures. Their spotless starch uniforms were highly polish \u2014 and highly pol- polished boots, must have been quite a contrast with the wrecks and filths we were in. I remember when others were given to rest, we turned the seams of our prisoners striped clothes from inside out, and squashed as many lice as we could between our fingernails. The itching was unbearable. By now some of the events are blurred. Others are more deeply engraved in my memory. I still can see half faces of the RG-50.030*0584 \" German civilian population, the other half hidden behind the curtain, watching as we marched. What were they thinking? What did they feel? Once, taking a rest near woods, we heard shots. We found out later that someone was shot trying to escape. How could anyone hope to escape? Besides being so heavily guarded, we had only our prisoner\u2019s clothes on. How far could we go without being caught? So we kept marching. We ate grass, and even this was forbidden, if a cruel guard chose to do so. Days and nights went by. More and more people were unable to keep walking, and each of us was too weak to be able to help someone else. We could hardly lift our own feet. How dreadful and painful it was to have to leave someone dear behind to die. We came up on a desolate concentration camp. There was no movement anywhere. It was so eerie. Where were the people? Were they also marching, or were they shipped into crematoria? When we still had strength to talk, we kept evaluating our situation. One terrifying thought went through our minds. We were fearful, and then when the Germans will realize that they have lost, they will shoot us anyway. We imagined that they will need our uniforms to make an easier escape. There was so little hope for our survival, one way or the other. How they do it, keep marching. My most vivid memories are of a situation which occurred on a farmland. Naturally, we were very hungry, and exhausted when others came to rest. Some prisoner noticed in the distance of the field, a wagon loaded with potatoes, which several farmers were about to plant. As soon as some of the women prisoner noticed RG-50.030*0584 \u00b0* it, they began running to grab some potatoes. My Aunt Polly started to run. I grabbed her with the little strength I had left, and pleaded with her not to go. Just then rifle fire started blasting and that women were falling everywhere. A young woman, she could have been between 18 - 20 years old, was shot in the leg. She tried to get up, but couldn\u2019t. She was not too far from us. What pain and terror were reflected in her eyes. She screamed and pleaded for help. The Germans took their time to kill her. We kept walking, leaving more and more people behind, often stepping over them. As we grew weaker and could hardly walk with our eyes open, letting ourselves to be pushed by the mass of people, my \u2014 my aunt and our small group of friends around us tried to reassure ourself that one or the other are still with us. From time to time we called each other\u2019s names in weak voices, and our responses brought some relief to the others. The rest periods were welcome, but it was increasingly more difficult to get up, and to keep marching. Actually, for most of us, 1t was impossible to get up, but as soon as a shot was fired into the helpless prisoners, we collected our bit \u2014 last bits of energy and kept going. One day we found ourself on another farmland. There was even food for us in kettles in a huge barn. After eating and some rest, we were ordered once more to get up and to continue to march. Only this time, some of us were no longer able to do so. We reached our limits. We had to give up. We were told that if we will not vacate this barn, it will be locked and burned with us in it. It seemed that our fate was sealed. RG-50.030*0584 \u201c Some women were still able to get up and go. We found out later that they were shot, and that that Nazis did use their uniforms. As for us in the barn, freedom came in the last moment, and a Russian soldier on a motorcycle, leading the way to more Russian soldiers on trucks appeared and prevented the burning of the barn, with our living corpses in it. I have no recollection of what I felt at the time of our liberation. I \u2014I don\u2019t remember if I fully comprehended that it was all over, and we were finally and truly free."
