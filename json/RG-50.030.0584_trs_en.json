So, when we came to \u0152 they took us to delouse, because there was a terrible RG-50.030*0584 48epidemic of typhoid in the camp, and then it was already under control, but every so often, they took us to delouse us, our clothes, our hair, us, to Camp A. When I came to Camp A, a group of people were walking ther e, and I looked at them and I said, are these human beings? Are these human beings? The people were yellow green; their eyes, their teeth, their fingernails, everything was yellow green. I said, who are these people? They were people from Camp C, the worst of the camp, which the people were working \u0152 working with poison ous gases, and they were dying a slow death. It was \u0152 the book I have about Skarzysko-Kamienna called, \ufb01Death Comes in Yellow,\ufb02 is because of the people. When we came to werk A, often, we have to \u0152 they assembled us on a big assembly place, and we had to watch executions of prisoners by hanging or by shooting. So, wh en I was \u0152 when we were supposed to go to werk A, my emotions were really torn, because I was so happy to be able to see my beloved aunt and uncle, but I was so afraid to see an-another execution. The worse were also \u0152 okay \u0152 one day I was so tired working at this huge machine, and it was the end of the shift, and I was \u0152 I just didn\u2122t know what to do, I just \u0152 I didn\u2122t \u0152 I was almost sleeping and working. And the obermeister came to check the ammunition, and went to \u0152 took some of mi ne and it went throu gh, and he\u2122s got, was ist ein das, what is this? Then he took the next one and it went through, and he started louder, was ist ein das? And then the next one, and all of it was bad, all of it was bad. How could I tell him that I just c ould not function? I \u0152 I \u0152 I just couldn\u2122t do RG-50.030*0584 49it any more, I was so tired, and so hungry, I didn\u2122t know what I was doing. So after the \u0152 after a few, he took the ammunition a nd with every one he knocked on my hair and screamed, was ist ein das, was ist ein das? And then he walked away to his office, which was off the machine room. After a few minutes he came back and called me. As I was walking behind him, I knew. I knew what it meant. And I could s \u0152 I could see the silence of the \u0152 I could hear the silence of my fellow prisoners and I could see their tears as I was ma-marching behind him. And all I remember is thinking, what will it do to my father when he finds out that he had lost me too? I \u0152 I knew what my fate will be. I came to his office, and he looked at me and looked at me and looked at me and paused. And th en he said, take the broom, sweep my office, and go back to work. I don\u2122t know if my youth m oved him, if he had maybe a daughter my age. But something moved him. I also am convinced that when I was not taken in Plasz\u00f3w , it was because I was small and I was standing behind somebody and they simply did not see me . Because there\u2122s absolutely no reason why I am here and my brother and others are dead. Th \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m convince of it, that they just did not see me. And it\u2122s not because of I \u0152 because I was hiding, because I wasn\u2122t. I \u0152 you know.

They were older, I was the youngest, and we were cleaning with big, metal rods, we were cleaning scratches inside of the bombs. I learned the most beautiful poetry during this time, Polish poetry. The two sisters started one day to \u0152 just bring something from the outside world. And I was so hungry to learn, I said, teach me. And so they started \u0152 I star ted memorizing in the words which we couldn\u2122t pronoun \u0152 which I could not remember. Somebody smuggled a piece of chalk, so I wrote it on the bomb.

            "answer": "And he survived. Okay, it was at the end of March or beginning of April, 1945. From newspaper clippings smuggled into the ammunition factory by a non-Jewish Belgian friend, we knew that the situation did not look good for the Germans. One evening, as we lay stretched on our plank beds, we heard sounds of shelling, gunfire and explosions. We knew that these were th e sounds of the American front being so RG-50.030*0584 60near. What sweet sounds they were. Our hopes for being soon free rose high. Unfortunately, our euphoria was very sh ort-lived. Around nine or 10 o\u2122clock the same evening, we were ordered to assemb le outside on the assembly field. I don\u2122t remember if we were told for what purpose. We were given some supply of food, and we were marched out of the camp in to the darkness of the night. About 5,000 women began their new journey. A jour ney which became known as the death march. We marched and marched. Days re placed nights. We ke pt marching, given short periods of rest. We mar-marched in sunshine and we marched in the rain. We marched through towns, and we marched through villages. No one knew where we were going. Later we found out that we were walking between the American and the Russian front. While we were marching, we were heavily guarded by our captors. They were working in shifts. Replacements for them were coming on trucks. Food was delivered to them, while our was long gone. The officers among our captors were driving by in comfortable cars, enjoying the sight of marching subhuman creatures. Their spotless starch uniforms were highly polish \u0152 and highly polpolished boots, must have been quite a contrast with the wrecks and filths we were in. I remember when others were given to rest, we turned the seams of our prisoners striped clothes from inside out, and squash ed as many lice as we could between our fingernails. The itching was unbearable. By now some of the events are blurred. Others are more deeply engraved in my memory. I still can see half faces of the RG-50.030*0584 61German civilian population, the other half hidden behind the curtain, watching as we marched. What were they thinking? What did they feel? Once, taking a rest near woods, we heard shots. We found out later that someone was shot trying to escape. How could anyone hope to escape? Besides being so heavily guarded, we had only our prisoner\u2122s clothes on. Ho w far could we go without being caught? So we kept marching. We ate grass, and even this was forbidden, if a cruel guard chose to do so. Days and nights went by. More and more people were unab le to keep walking, and each of us was too weak to be able to help someone else. We could hardly lift our own feet. How dreadful and painful it was to have to leave someone dear behind to die. We came up on a desolate concentration camp. There was no movement anywhere. It was so eerie. Where were the people? Were they also marching, or were they shipped into crematoria? When we still had strength to talk, we kept evaluating our situation. One terrifying thought went through our minds. We were fearful, and then when the Germans will realize that they have lost, they will shoot us anyway. We imagined that they will need our uniforms to make an easier escape. There was so little hope for our survival, one way or the other. How they do it, keep marching. My most vivid memories are of a situation which occurred on a farmland. Naturally, we were very hungry, and exhausted when others came to rest. Some prisoner noticed in the distance of the field, a wagon loaded with potatoes, which several farmers were about to plant. As soon as some of the women prisoner noticed RG-50.030*0584 62it, they began running to grab some potatoes. My Aunt Polly started to run. I grabbed her with the little strength I had left, and pleaded with her not to go. Just then rifle fire started blasting and that women were falling everywhere. A young woman, she could have been between 18 - 20 years old, was shot in the leg. She tried to get up, but couldn\u2122t. She was not too far from us. What pain and terror were reflected in her eyes. She screamed and pleaded for help. The Germans took their time to kill her. We kept walking, leaving more and more people behind, often stepping over them. As we grew weaker and could hardly walk with our eyes open, letting ourselves to be pushed by the mass of people, my \u0152 my aunt and our small group of friends around us tried to reassure ourself that one or the other are still with us. From time to time we called each other\u2122s names in weak voices, and our responses brought some relief to the others . The rest periods were welcome, but it was increasingly more difficult to get up, a nd to keep marching. Actually, for most of us, it was impossible to get up, but as soon as a shot was fired into the helpless prisoners, we collected our bit \u0152 last bits of energy and kept going. One day we found ourself on another farmland. There was even food for us in kettles in a huge barn. After eating and some rest, we were ordered once more to get up and to continue to march. Only this time, some of us were no longer able to do so. We reached our limits. We had to give up. We were told that if we will not vacate this barn, it will be locked and burned with us in it. It seemed that our fate was sealed. RG-50.030*0584 63Some women were still able to get up and go. We found out later that they were shot, and that that Nazis did use their uniforms. As for us in the barn, freedom came in the last moment, and a Russian soldier on a motorcycle, leading the way to more Russian soldiers on trucks appeared and pr evented the burning of the barn, with our living corpses in it. I have no recollection of what I felt at the time of our liberation. I \u0152 I don\u2122t remember if I fully comprehended that it was all over, and we were finally and truly free."
