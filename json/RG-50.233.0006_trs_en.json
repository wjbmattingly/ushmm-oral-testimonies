I have to say the way it is whether you\u2122re Christian, whether you\u2122re believer or not. You do this, to say as it was. Very anti-Semitic. The Polaks, very stupid. They only know one thing. We Jews killed our God! That\u2122s what they knew. For instance, it came, let\u2122s say twice a year you have for two or three weeks, a holiday from the school. Once a year, vacation, two months. Let\u2122s say that twice a year like Christmas time or Easter, right? The two holidays is about Jesus Christ -- I woul dn\u2122t say us Jews. We knew a little bit more those days what\u2122s with Jesus and what\u2122s the story. They didn\u2122t know nothing; they only knew one thing. You killed our God! If he is a god, how can you kill him? Alright, now I am different than I was then. Tough on Judaism 4also. Because I know more the reality; I am more educated and so on and so on. That time I was Jew 100%. Now I\u2122m born Jew, I am Jew but I\u2122m different. Not agreeing with everything -- so going, let\u2122s say it was the Christmas holiday, the last day of the holiday, the last day in school before the holiday. Then the action for two, three weeks. They came with stri ngs and to the string attached weights, like a kilo weight, a half a kilo weight and that\u2122s the way. They knew that they were going out from the school. If it ha ppened during the day, I go to the teacher and I put a report, something happens. Not too much, but something. But this time he knows in the afternoon, he\u2122s out from the school for three weeks -- kill that Jew, hit that Jew. So that\u2122s the way they were hitting.

Unfortunately it happened to me this week I told you. When they came out, we were walking. Oh, you Jew! Bang! It happened to me this week, almost the same thing.

Of course, there was anti-Semitic and so on and so on but I wouldn\u2122t let them think you heard, you Jew, you Jew. You killed our God, you Jew killed our God. I loved the school, I was going to the school. I loved it, I wanted to go further whether I could afford or not. But unfortunately, the anti-Semitism was very big.

            "answer": "Yes, anti-Semitism was very, very big. A Jew couldn\u2122t get too much of it. They say it is -- they say -- he couldn\u2122t get to a higher -- no. They felt it in the school, on the street; they felt it all over, all over. The Germans, they knew where to make the crematoriums. They didn\u2122t make too many in Czechoslovakia, different people. Same Catholics, different. But in Poland, all the crematoriums, all the camps were in Poland. I was in the camp in the beginning, near our hometown. I didn\u2122t have to run away. I could have walked away but where? You walk away and the Polak will give you for a kilo ______, for two pounds of sugar. If not for him, I would run, always on the run. He didn\u2122t let me. The last three months we were not together. This because they separated us whatever. But whenever I wanted to go, run --. One year we we re on the camp near our hometown. I was going out from the camp. I was that time, I was a bricklayer. Bricklayer, cememting, this and that. You were looking for places that you should be inside. Because fighting with hunger is one fight but fighting with the weather and the cold, two fights was way too hard. You were looking for \u0152 but looking; it\u2122s not you\u2122re given application. But I ws a young fellow, I don\u2122t know. They tell me that I am smart and this and that. Fine, inside, going out for sand, for this. Let\u2122s say a village nearby and going out for lime, to dig lime, I could have gone away. That was in 1942, I had no guards over me. Only me and the polka with the horse and carriage. All of a sudden I hear a voice. What is the voice? Hey you, boyfellow, how can I get into the camp? I saw he\u2122s a Jew. I says, who are you? He tells me the name. In the villages, very few Jews lived. The ones who lived, you knew his name even if you didn\u2122t know him. I am Zalek Division he said. I look at him. Why do you want to go into the cam p? I haven\u2122t got place where to go. I gave them away everything \u0152 all mine wh atever, gone. I don\u2122t want to hear. I haven\u2122t got where to go. I\u2122m sick and tired already. What\u2122 ll happen, will happen, what we were told will be with me. I says don\u2122t do it. It\u2122s not so easy to get in because you got all -- they counting you, you come in, they counting you. It was not a question to run away. The question was, where will I hide? I see the German, the uniform, I run away from him. But I see a Polak, do I know which one is good and which one is no good? But I still wanted to run away. But he didn\u2122t let me. He was then -- he like 24 years difference from me. I was a young boy, 18, 19 years. Run, no. Besides this, if you going to run away, they take the next ten and they kill. Especially first was the family, it\u2122s the same name, you can\u2122t deny. So that was the story. We suffered in this hometown -- it was four kilometers from the hometown. When we got to work they came for this work with a horse and carriage to give a day\u2122s duty, performance, whatever. What did they do for us? They didn\u2122t have to do, ju st look away. yes, you gave them the good shirt from your body, they gave you a kilo bread. But we knew, for two pounds of sugar, the Germans gave a proclamation: If you bring one Jew a 6family, two pounds of sugar, they did it. Isn\u2122t that a shame? Don\u2122t do for me good but don\u2122t do it for me either."

A week before, it was bombs, which people got killed al ready, in front of me. One woman got killed -- I run out with a cover to cover her and so on. The second day they came in so naturally, we all start praying, we were afraid. After the Germans start to go around, nothing will happen, everything is quiet, we should go out on the street normal.

The Ukrainians were the guards but beside the Ukrainians was the lagerfuhrer, the SS man, that Fiess and he has his helper a nd a few officers but they were with the guards. Those Ukrainian guards, they were not allowed to go in the camp. They were allowed their duty, not in the camp. You ask me a question, what did they have a business to go in the camp? there was a lot of business. For instance, you came home -- we had a stock market, as I to ld you, we had bargain of this. They didn\u2122t have too much to eat so they, from the guard, they came in, not all of them, whoever was duty-free and they was looking by us. Or sometimes, when we came in by the gate, counting so they can pull you out. In the boot, this they were allowed and to strip you and to look. Sometimes you find money also. Anything you were not allowed you could find, otherwise, we were not able to survive and so on and so on. In 1943, when it was the Warsaw uprising and the rest of the people, they brought to Treblinka. Why I mentioned this? it\u2122s a connection. From Treblinka, 800 people, they brought to us, to Budzyn in that camp. Eight hundred people, well-dressed,_______ they brought them to us, 800. When they brought them to us, so the Ukrainian______ I\u2122m an old calhoon but those arte the new ones and they knew, the Germans didn\u2122 t know so much as the Ukrainians, they knew that they have money and so on and so on. Going in from work,_____, that\u2122s a new one, a Ukrainian pulled him out, stripped him --they stripped once my uncle also. They came in, in the barra cks. Once, if the lagerfuhrer, that Fiess or his helper, adjutant, came in and saw in the guard. And the guard said, this one, where are they? Right away you guard, you are not allowed to do that \u0152 shoot him. So they were sleeping, thos e var_____people and this and that. Many came over to me, they say this all the tim e, I\u2122m an honest guy and so on. Abie, do me a favor. Here\u2122s 5, 600 zlotys, hide them. Where did you hide them? At wotrk. If tomorrow you didn\u2122t go there, -- I had a young fellow, a Yugoslavian. He was a year older than I am. I remember his name, German, which he was my master, I worked for him. I had to____________. I had a hiding____, he knew. I didn\u2122t tell him exactly and I had the key. There were no honest people, listen, when it comes to a piece of bread, it\u2122s a different story. But they saw the honesty in me, this one gave me 800 zlotys, this one gave me 500, to hide it every time. They give me and I had it on the top, on the attic in the sand. Once I came there and it was dry there, nothing there. Somebody looked, they see what I\u2122m doing, can\u2122t say a word, you got to keep your mouth shut because --. That\u2122s the way when the Russian people came to us and they were________. They told us stories from Treblinka and so on and so on. Then they decided to liquuidate that camp. Before that liquidation of the camp, all of a sudden, there was typhus. There was no water. That was, I think, in \u212243. There is typhus. Are you surprised? Whoever was sick, there were both \u0152 the stomach typhuses and there is a planastic like a rash from. I had both. Whoever si ck, they took one barrack and there they put the people. Every morning that Fiess came in before breakfast. We called his machine gun, this hunsagle. What is a huns agle, we always called it, he shouldn\u2122t understand because a lot of Jewish is lik e German. Hunsagle means like hands-up 17and that carbine, machine carbine looked like it. He\u2122s going already with the --. Every morning he came in and he took us people, he rush them off from the barrack and running. Besides this, there wasn\u2122t those blocks, those blocks you saw. Was block 2, outside from the fence, right across the street. There was that block and in that block was a lazarett. It means a hospital. If you was sick, they took you there. It was like, it was -- in camp was tailor place, shoemaker place, it was for us. But in that block was for the SS. Some people were there and there was a lazarett also. Other times, he took out and he shoot. He was already in the typhus. But listen, he was a man of 35 at that time, 38, a strong guy. He could make it. I was a little kid 18 years old. But we didn\u2122t go that far, we worked in the colony so it was like ten minutes from the camp. Every day I want to work. I went to work. I dsat down, I sit. I couldn\u2122t do nothing. That guy, Brumula, what is the hell the matter with you? I said, k eep your mouth shut. I was returned like this. He only pray to God he should be an SS man and I should be in his camp. I said you shouldn\u2122t live to that. His father was one foot shorter and he wass in the werk there and he was an SOB. He brought me to eat from his house. If he should know that, he should spend with me again. It was \u0152 (female voice: it was life or death every minute). So you go into a story. I could not survive to stay in camp, it\u2122s the death. If I would have to go the three, four kilometers to the barrack, but here ---. We had the obermei ster, that was the head supervisor from the milers. He was so short, Schultz, a German from Ostowiec. He had here an STP National Organization with the H_____. He was a good guy, they were good_______. Not from the Lithuanians, Ukrainians but from the Germans, but fortunately I have to say the truth. He comes in, hey Morris to him. What is with your son Brumula. If he\u2122s sick, he has t p. He said to me, meister Schultz, sh --, sh --. No he has to stay in the lazarett. That means the hospital. Comes over to me, how you feel? I feel all right. You don\u2122t be ask me, you don\u2122t feel right. You got to stay in the hospital. You were not allowed to tell outside what is going on inside. If they found out, so you know what is the result, what the verdict is. But whoever wanted to find out something, he found out. One day he comes over to me, tell you that time I was as tall as him. I know already what\u2122s going on here. I keep my mouth shut. You\u2122re af raid to go because Fiess every time he shoots, you\u2122re dead. I don\u2122t say a word. That\u2122s an interesting story. I know already what to do. I don\u2122t answer nothing. What is he going to do but ---. I says I\u2122m going, kill, kill me, what\u2122s the differenc e? He went over to that Fiess and he told me,______ and Heil Hitler, you know, break bodice. Hey, listen, I have by me such a good faulker and so on and so on but he\u2122s thinking he needs a lazarett. So let him go in. He says sh, sh. I won\u2122 t guarantee, not in that barrack. I want him in the lazarett. That\u2122s the way he to ld me the story. I didn\u2122t hear. You stay tomorrow in lager and you will go to the lazarett and don\u2122t be afraid of nothing. Tomorrow they took me into that block 2, to that lazarett. Than that block 2 in lazarett in this bed was laying a man probabl y I have in the picture, that his sister, like that Stochman was from the men, the leader, his sister was from the women. Her brother was laying in one bed with something I sign here. They put me next to his bed and they also put me in so mething like 00 I don\u2122t remember what it was, a sign.
