Which they survived, a lot of them did not survive. That girl, right, she\u2019s a grandmother, she lives in New Jersey. A few boys here, old friends, which we went together to cheder. We went from the first to the seventh class, we are together. I have a friend here, not far from here and we meet together. We have our -- everyone, that\u2019s since 1900\u2019s that emigrated here, they made societies, like our society, the Krasnik Society, which we meet every month and we do in charity everything and so on between us and for Israel and in general. Now, for instance, in the wintertime we don\u2019t 2 have because we all older people, so they are in Florida here and there. March, we Start again, which we used to meet in Manhattan. Now, most live in Brooklyn SO we meet here in Heights Congregation. We make a party once a while; we have our own cemetery and so on. That\u2019s almost every hometown has but a lot, like the youth, don\u2019t go in so they give up. Which I\u2019m trying now to take in my kids to it. Of course we had friends; we played together, we went to school together, yes, yes. Other than Jewish friends, very little. I especially had a few because, as I said, we lived in a street, one side was Jews and one side was non- Jews. But mostly like the little towns, most of 1t populated from the Jews. Like the surroundings around, like the farmers and this, they lived around the town. They called it in Jewish the shtetl."

It was like a ghetto life. That time we didn\u2019t realize now. Now we realized, we live in a big city, all kinds of nationalities, we realized that it\u2019s a different life.

            "answer": "Yes. Like for instance, here we celebrate a Christmas altogether nice whether you believe or not, we celebrate together. I lived with neighbors, Italian; I am Jewish. It\u2019s Hanukkah, I put out the candles; they put out whatever it is. It\u2019s mutual. But there it wasn\u2019t unfortunately. I have to say the way it is whether you\u2019re Christian, whether you\u2019re believer or not. You do this, to say as it was. Very anti-Semitic. The Polaks, very stupid. They only know one thing. We Jews killed our God! That\u2019s what they knew. For instance, it came, let\u2019s say twice a year you have for two or three weeks, a holiday from the school. Once a year, vacation, two months. Let\u2019s say that twice a year like Christmas time or Easter, right? The two holidays is about Jesus Christ -- I wouldn\u2019t say us Jews. We knew a little bit more those days what\u2019s with Jesus and what\u2019s the story. They didn\u2019t know nothing; they only knew one thing. You killed our God! If he is a god, how can you kill him? Alright, now I am different than I was then. Tough on Judaism 3 also. Because I know more the reality; I am more educated and so on and so on. That time I was Jew 100%. Now I\u2019m born Jew, I am Jew but I\u2019m different. Not agreeing with everything -- so going, let\u2019s say it was the Christmas holiday, the last day of the holiday, the last day in school before the holiday. Then the action for two, three weeks. They came with strings and to the string attached weights, like a kilo weight, a half a kilo weight and that\u2019s the way. They knew that they were going out from the school. If it happened during the day, I go to the teacher and I put a report, something happens. Not too much, but something. But this time he knows in the afternoon, he\u2019s out from the school for three weeks -- kill that Jew, hit that Jew. So that\u2019s the way they were hitting. You came home bloodied, with blood, with faces like this. You killed our God! That was the only thing. That was Christmas time. It came ---."

You went through the main street like they call it here Kasioska, there was the movie. As a matter of fact, from the movie was a Jew. At that time wasn\u2019t movies like today. There was outside all the pictures what the movie 1s. The movie was calling G___. Now, why, it\u2019s not Polish, maybe it was ---. That was all the story when Christ raises and so on and so on."

            "answer": "When you pass there, it\u2019s the same thing, it\u2019s the same thing. Anti-Semitism was very big. Let\u2019s say Saturday afternoon, we were juvenile boys, we went out for a walk in the main street. As I said, the whole shtetl was Jews. Around -- so Polaks when they came out. Unfortunately it happened to me this week I told you. When they came out, we were walking. Oh, you Jew! Bang! It happened to me this week, almost the same thing. Where I work on Seventh Avenue between 38\" and 37\" Street. I leave work at a quarter to six. You go out, it\u2019s a big traffic of people. I have to go this way to 42\u2122 Street station but people, they going en masse to the station, to the Penn station. One young fellow, taller than you -- it was raining. Alright, a short fellow like me with the umbrella, maybe I didn\u2019t have it down, the umbrella. Alright, while walking you walk this way, this walk that way. But one tall guy, a young fellow came towards me and like this with his rear almost to my face. What\u2019s the memory? I shouldn\u2019t say what. You son-of-a-bitch \u2014 he could have gone and killed me. I was sorry after what I said but it remind me of the years in Poland. But alright, sometimes, as I said, you said excuse me, he didn\u2019t, alright. But this, a young fellow, so it remind me of this. Of course, there was anti-Semitic and so on and so on but I wouldn\u2019t let them think you heard, you Jew, you Jew. You killed our God, you Jew killed our God. I loved the school, I was going to the school. I loved it, I wanted to go further whether I could afford or not. But unfortunately, the anti-Semitism was very big. We had in our hometown, we had the gymnasium. It\u2019s like here, 4 college. Here gymnasium 1s like for the . But very seldom a Jew could go in, even if he could pay."

            "question": "Right.",
            "answer": "Yes, anti-Semitism was very, very big. A Jew couldn\u2019t get too much of it. They say it is -- they say -- he couldn\u2019t get to a higher -- no. They felt it in the school, on the street; they felt it all over, all over. The Germans, they knew where to make the crematoriums. They didn\u2019t make too many in Czechoslovakia, different people. Same Catholics, different. But in Poland, all the crematoriums, all the camps were in Poland. I was in the camp in the beginning, near our hometown. I didn\u2019t have to run away. I could have walked away but where? You walk away and the Polak will give you for a kilo , for two pounds of sugar. If not for him, I would run, always on the run. He didn\u2019t let me. The last three months we were not together. This because they separated us whatever. But whenever I wanted to go, run --. One year we were on the camp near our hometown. I was going out from the camp. I was that time, I was a bricklayer. Bricklayer, cememting, this and that. You were looking for places that you should be inside. Because fighting with hunger is one fight but fighting with the weather and the cold, two fights was way too hard. You were looking for \u2014 but looking; it\u2019s not you\u2019re given application. But I ws a young fellow, I don\u2019t know. They tell me that I am smart and this and that. Fine, inside, going out for sand, for this. Let\u2019s say a village nearby and going out for lime, to dig lime, I could have gone away. That was in 1942, I had no guards over me. Only me and the polka with the horse and carriage. All of a sudden I hear a voice. What is the voice? Hey you, boy- fellow, how can I get into the camp? I saw he\u2019s a Jew. I says, who are you? He tells me the name. In the villages, very few Jews lived. The ones who lived, you knew his name even if you didn\u2019t know him. I am Zalek Division he said. I look at him. Why do you want to go into the camp? I haven\u2019t got place where to go. I gave them away everything \u2014 all mine whatever, gone. I don\u2019t want to hear. I haven\u2019t got where to go. I\u2019m sick and tired already. What\u2019ll happen, will happen, what we were told will be with me. I says don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not so easy to get in because you got all -- they counting you, you come in, they counting you. It was not a question to run away. The question was, where will I hide? I see the German, the uniform, I run away from him. But I see a Polak, do I know which one is good and which one is no good? But I still wanted to run away. But he didn\u2019t let me. He was then -- he like 24 years difference from me. I was a young boy, 18, 19 years. Run, no. Besides this, if you going to run away, they take the next ten and they kill. Especially first was the family, it\u2019s the same name, you can\u2019t deny. So that was the story. We suffered in this hometown -- it was four kilometers from the hometown. When we got to work they came for this work with a horse and carriage to give a day\u2019s duty, performance, whatever. What did they do for us? They didn\u2019t have to do, just look away. yes, you gave them the good shirt from your body, they gave you a kilo bread. But we knew, for two pounds of sugar, the Germans gave a proclamation: If you bring one Jew a 5 family, two pounds of sugar, they did it. Isn\u2019t that a shame? Don\u2019t do for me good but don\u2019t do it for me either."

            "answer": "Well, the war started September the 1\u2018. Naturally, as the war is, bombs with everything, whatever. I didn\u2019t understand too much. I didn\u2019t know too much. Two weeks later, the Germans came into our hometown. It happened, it was the first, or the second day of Rosh Hashanah, the New Year\u2019s. Of course, we didn\u2019t believe it or not in the synagogue. It\u2019s not like the big town, every corner you had a synagogue. In the little towns, I don\u2019t know how it was in the big towns, the little town was a shul and a basm . That means one is the synagogue and one is like other than a synagogue. Let\u2019s say the synagogue every Saturday, the basm____ was for every day, day and night, even to go in for a whole night, if you were cold, to warm up. So it\u2019s Rosh Hashanah, New Year\u2019s. Before New Year\u2019s people like leaders grabbed the scrolls, the Torah, which you probably know, the scroll and they brought them. Let\u2019s say, this one brought to his house and around the neighbors, we prayed there. Was the first day or the second day of Rosh Hashanah, we heard, of course, shooting and this and that. A week before, it was bombs, which people got killed already, in front of me. One woman got killed -- I run out with a cover to cover her and so on. The second day they came in so naturally, we all start praying, we were afraid. After the Germans start to go around, nothing will happen, everything is quiet, we should go out on the street normal. About two, three days later started the feelings of the German. First they took -- in Polish they call it , hostages. Let\u2019s say this one 1s a rich one, they went into the magistrate, to the - and they got through the big Jews. They took this one, they took this one, they took this one. One they killed right away to show us what\u2019s all about it if we don\u2019t -- if we revolt against them or what. It started, they were there. Naturally -- and we didn\u2019t know. Now we know what the politics was between Stalin and Hitler. They made some kind of --."

The next day they came in a patrol; with a tank and the school square where I went to school. We all around to look; everybody looked. The Germans were laying down looking at the tank and so on. I didn\u2019t understand Russian but it\u2019s almost similar. All the people understood. They said like they are twenty kilometers from us. It\u2019s more possibility that they\u2019re going to turn back till the Bok, the River. That\u2019s what happened, they turned back.

I said how can I leave you. The grandfather was laying in bed paralyzed. He couldn\u2019t move, he couldn\u2019t talk. It was naturally, seven years already. The only one because he and me, we were 1n the town. But he was a businessman with his wife and children and I was near my grandmother. So nobody understood it, only me. For instance, they bombed before they came in. I took him on my back, as little as I was, and I dragged him to a cellar whatever. He says I don\u2019t want to live no more. So nobody understood him, that\u2019s enough for me. My grandmother says, go run. I says, where I\u2019m going to run? Leave you with the sick grandfather? No. Those days wasn\u2019t like today but I am today in this respect, I am today ess in this respect, no time old fashioned like. I\u2019m American, I\u2019m modernized but in this respect, I don\u2019t want my pleasure I want my family to give . So I says no, that\u2019s all there is to it. After he run away with his wife and children to a village, people were running even before they came in. How could I, I wouldn\u2019t go nowhere. Then it started with the Germans. They were there -- people ran, people came back. Naturally youth people. I had friends, people came back; they got stuck. They couldn\u2019t go back, they went to concentration camps.

Hey Jew, hey Jews, you cleaning for us. Like this, all standing in the road, that was the memory it was. It was plenty snow; God gave us also plenty . Poland had also a pact with Hitler and Stalin. Besides this, they found a lot of work. The minute they came in, our hometown was an industrialized city. It was like in central Poland. My grandmother told me in the other war, they came in and they got out. So they, the Polaks, were building ammunition places and so on and so on. Lately they found it out that mostly the architects and everything, they were Germans and it was everything and they made big places around the city. There they took us to work. What was then to do? The Polaks, the farmers, they had to bring in the tags like. What was the tags? The grain and so on and so on. We were working there, shipping there on the wagons, it was all kinds of work to do. There was a big \u2014 then the Germans started there to make, they figure out already that they\u2019re going to go in war with Russia. Now we know it. All of a sudden, there was a valley which it was filled from the Polaks. They took it away and they started to 7 build a -- in German, they call it . What does it mean? That means gasolines, with oils, with everything towards the war. On the ground, they took us, we had to go every day from the house to work which the Judenrat -- probably you heard of the Judenrat -- they send you -- every day off to work. If you didn\u2019t go, they came for you with the Jewish police and they arrested you. Let\u2019s say if I didn\u2019t have a few days\u2019 work for me, I went out on the square there; you came along, you gave me ten zlotys, I work for you. First I look to who has. Every day I was at work. Whether voluntarily or not, being home, they going to catch me just the same. I needed a couple zlotys to make a living. In the meantime, you were at work, the Polaks brought in potatoes and all kinds of vegetables."

The rail was going and the by the Polaks and they did that. Enough so that half a year later, they started the war so everything was from us. The first station to send them the work. Then they make a hanger , It\u2019s a big \u2014 airplanes, they started. We didn\u2019t make them but we fixed them and everything and so on. Like in 1943, was the first aus ____s means to send away the people. They knocked it - yes, before that, in spring, all of a sudden, that was \u00b043, in the middle of the night, they came and says from Lublin to the Judenrat and they told them what they want them to do. We didn\u2019t know. They knocked at every door, every Jewish door, the Judenrat, the Jewish police, had to show them which is a Jewish home. They knocked on every door and they kicked them out on the square, on the school place there with Germans and Jewish police, Polish police around, to watch them who they took out. I lived in that house, as I said, on the other side was Polak. My grandfather died already. He died right in \u201940 which now, next month is the anniversary, 50 year, in 1940. He says 52. I, with the grandmother in our house. He lived at the end of the street with his in-laws. There was he and his wife, three children. There was a brother-in-law. He came back from Brussels in \u00b038. Three years he couldn\u2019t stay, the war goes, he came back. When he came back from Marseille till German -- he had to go by train -- when he saw everything, he said, give me a little boat and I go back already. He saw everything. Him and his son and his wife, and another brother-in-law with a son, they all took out. There was the that saved him, from seven o\u2019clock until six in the morning. Six o\u2019clock in the morning, they knocking on our door. My grandmother said, you don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll go to the door. You hide under the bed. She yells out, who is it, who is 1t? She says, mother-in-law in Jewish, schiga, it\u2019s Liah, open up. She\u2019s crying. She opens up, she comes in and cries. They took away everybody from their house, except the women, except her with the children. The sister, the son they took and the mother. They took everybody. We didn\u2019t know from nothing. They didn\u2019t act from under but she says it\u2019s going on \u2014 renting people to go. I said, you go out and see what you can do and I go and change it. My grandmother, she should rest wherever she is, she says no. I says, look if they are going to take away him , we all going to die from hunger. 8 If I going to be away, he\u2019s going to be here. I was a child. They say what kind of business you make, you didn\u2019t make business. But what he had, from the tailoring, from the magazines, he sold something. I couldn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t know, I was achild. I said, Jetma, please let me go and see. Naturally it was going on like a stock market. Whoever gave money, got it. She didn\u2019t give money, I went to . She was running there and back. By four o\u2019clock was a shooting and they took almost four kilometers to the station. They took them all to the station and from there they didn\u2019t know where. They started to find out, we find out where they are. They separate them into two camps. He was in a different camp, his brothers-in-law were in a different. It was near the Russian border which before the war was there. I would say, very big jails from the Polaks. They called it Ka . There they send away like spies or whoever didn\u2019t make right business or didn\u2019t pay taxes \u2014 there they land. Well, you start with some people with a horse and carriage, they went there. They started, after six weeks, naturally you have to give money. Me, and I have one fellow in Israel and one fellow here, we went to change them. They came to, hey, you little guy, you going to change? I said, I firsr paid. After six weeks, I changed him. This was like forced labor. He was writing if you not going to take me out, I\u2019Il die there. The water was straight out of the river, which is going a little river to the big river, the Bok, which was the border between Russia and Germany.

What can you take with you? My grandmother she had to take -- whatever she took with her, how you call it when you die? A shroud, that\u2019s what she had with her because she wasn\u2019t as committed and that\u2019s what she had with her. They took us out and we\u2019re standing in the market; it\u2019s full.

All of a sudden, he says to me in German, hey ; hey young fellow, what are you doing here? Where is your family. I had my grandmother Ria. Over there, people were separate. I hear yelling, Avum \u2014__Avum____, that\u2019s me. Abraham, Avumeral, a little one is Avumeral, a big one is Ava. David, Davidol. His wife and she is yelling. Her sister with her husband --."

I says to Tante _._ They hit me, go back. Her sister and the husband what I mentioned 10 and the other brother with a son and the mother, they pulling Liah, come, come, we'll have a good place on the train. They were standing cattle and she, the minute, she had a feeling she didn\u2019t want to go, to have a good place. When swhe saw me, then more of it. This going back to that labor department, that guy, he pulls me out. Where is your family? My grandmother, next to me, and he pulls me standing people like by the building where the station is. We standing there and the police with guns, they push them to the wagons and us, they turning back to go home. While we were going home, they were waiting horse and carriage, they prepared. They callitthe _ from the Polaks. They took people on back but me with my grandmother till what, there was no. So we were walking. As we were walking the four kilometers, we found plenty dead people; all the people which we knew them very well. Probably they couldn\u2019t walk, they shoot them. We go about three kilometers, almost our town. Our town was on hills but the main town was in a valley. But it was a lot of hill down. When you\u2019re standing on this side of the town, you could see the whole town until over the other hill. We come and already they call it the w b , the wide mountain. You go into the town, comes along a Polak on his horse and carriage and he says to my grandmother which he knew her when probably they came to buy suits, he says to her, Altaruver that means my grandfather was alta, she is Altaruver, die son Herschek is home. What did he say? I says, Grandma, you heard what he said. What, is he joking? They didn\u2019t do enough to us? The Polaks . AS we come on the top of the hill to go down to the town, we see lights in his house. I say grandmother; she says probably the Polaks they already plundering, stealing. It was like half an hour ago, maybe took ten minutes. We come into the house. He is there with his wife and with his children and crying over. the name of her sister to have a good place. When I saw you, she says, I didn\u2019t want to go. What was the reason? Now, we knew the reason after, when we came back. When that arbeit , 1t means the labor department, a German, he looked around, it was like to send away half a town. The Judenrat knew it but we didn\u2019t know it. When he looked around, everybody looked for himself, especially the Germans. The German like this, if he wouldn\u2019t have that function, where will he go? in the war. Nobody wanted to go in the war, no matter how patriotic they were, how good it went for them. He had a function in this city, it\u2019s good. He looked around, he saw that there is more than a half gone and who remained? Older people, he wants to have the labor he needs. So he run to the station and he took out the people. Of course we came into his house. Then he says right away, go home to our house. Because in our house, was everything so we went there. That was 1941. Every day, to work, we saw already what the Germans are and so on and so on. There wasn\u2019t a family that people wasn\u2019t missing. After we found out, they took them to Belzec. There, nothing more to hear. What can I say how the turn was black, like in Jewish they say, Schwarz. Every day goes on work in this and that. I worked in the shop. Before they took away, as soon as the Germans came in, they took away 21 youths, I show you in the book, our hometown. The nicet youth, 21, 22, they took them away in the middle of the night after they ---. So every day to work, it comes for the two. In 1941, broke out the war with Russia. 11"

Those Ukrainian guards, they were not allowed to go in the camp. They were allowed their duty, not in the camp. You ask me a question, what did they have a business to go in the camp? there was a lot of business. For instance, you came home -- we had a stock market, as I told you, we had bargain of this. They didn\u2019t have too much to eat so they, from the guard, they came in, not all of them, whoever was duty-free and they was looking by us. Or sometimes, when we came in by the gate, counting so they can pull you out. In the boot, this they were allowed and to strip you and to look. Sometimes you find money also. Anything you were not allowed you could find, otherwise, we were not able to survive and so on and so on. In 1943, when it was the Warsaw uprising and the rest of the people, they brought to Treblinka. Why I mentioned this? it\u2019s a connection. From Treblinka, 800 people, they brought to us, to Budzyn in that camp. Eight hundred people, well-dressed, they brought them to us, 800. When they brought them to us, so the Ukrainian I\u2019m an old calhoon but those arte the new ones and they knew, the Germans didn\u2019t know so much as the Ukrainians, they knew that they have money and so on and so on. Going in from work, ; that\u2019s a new one, a Ukrainian pulled him out, stripped him --they stripped once my uncle also. They came in, in the barracks. Once, if the lagerfuhrer, that Fiess or his helper, adjutant, came in and saw in the guard. And the guard said, this one, where are they? Right away you guard, you are not allowed to do that \u2014 shoot him. So they were sleeping, those var people and this and that. Many came over to me, they say this all the time, I\u2019m an honest guy and so on. Abie, do me a favor. Here\u2019s 5, 600 zlotys, hide them. Where did you hide them? At wotrk. If tomorrow you didn\u2019t go there, -- I had a young fellow, a Yugoslavian. He was a year older than I am. I remember his name, German, which he was my master, I worked for him. I had to . [hadahiding _, he knew. I didn\u2019t tell him exactly and I had the key. There were no honest people, listen, when it comes to a piece of bread, it\u2019s a different story. But they saw the honesty in me, this one gave me 800 zlotys, this one gave me 500, to hide it every time. They give me and I had it on the top, on the attic in the sand. Once I came there and it was dry there, nothing there. Somebody looked, they see what I\u2019m doing, can\u2019t say a word, you got to keep your mouth shut because --. That\u2019s the way when the Russian people came to us and they were . They told us stories from Treblinka and so on and so on. Then they decided to liquuidate that camp. Before that liquidation of the camp, all of a sudden, there was typhus. There was no water. That was, I think, in 43. There is typhus. Are you surprised? Whoever was sick, there were both \u2014 the stomach typhuses and there is a planastic like arash from. I had both. Whoever sick, they took one barrack and there they put the people. Every morning that Fiess came in before breakfast. We called his machine gun, this hunsagle. What is a hunsagle, we always called it, he shouldn\u2019t understand because a lot of Jewish is like German. Hunsagle means like hands-up 16 and that carbine, machine carbine looked like it. He\u2019s going already with the --. Every morning he came in and he took us people, he rush them off from the barrack and running. Besides this, there wasn\u2019t those blocks, those blocks you saw. Was block 2, outside from the fence, right across the street. There was that block and in that block was a lazarett. It means a hospital. If you was sick, they took you there. It was like, it was -- in camp was tailor place, shoemaker place, it was for us. But in that block was for the SS. Some people were there and there was a lazarett also. Other times, he took out and he shoot. He was already in the typhus. But listen, he was a man of 35 at that time, 38, a strong guy. He could make it. I was a little kid 18 years old. But we didn\u2019t go that far, we worked in the colony so it was like ten minutes from the camp. Every day I want to work. I went to work. I dsat down, I sit. I couldn\u2019t do nothing. That guy, Brumula, what is the hell the matter with you? I said, keep your mouth shut. I was returned like this. He only pray to God he should be an SS man and I should be in his camp. I said you shouldn\u2019t live to that. His father was one foot shorter and he wass in the werk there and he was an SOB. He brought me to eat from his house. If he should know that, he should spend with me again. It was \u2014 (female voice: it was life or death every minute). So you go into a story. I could not survive to stay in camp, it\u2019s the death. If I would have to go the three, four kilometers to the barrack, but here ---. We had the obermeister, that was the head supervisor from the milers. He was so short, Schultz, a German from Ostowiec. He had here an STP National Organization with the H . He was a good guy, they were good . Not from the Lithuanians, Ukrainians but from the Germans, but fortunately I have to say the truth. He comes in, hey Morris to him. What is with your son Brumula. If he\u2019s sick, he has tp. He said to me, meister Schultz, sh --, sh --. No he has to stay in the lazarett. That means the hospital. Comes over to me, how you feel? I feel all right. You don\u2019t be ask me, you don\u2019t feel right. You got to stay in the hospital. You were not allowed to tell outside what is going on inside. If they found out, so you know what is the result, what the verdict is. But whoever wanted to find out something, he found out. One day he comes over to me, tell you that time I was as tall as him. I know already what\u2019s going on here. I keep my mouth shut. You\u2019re afraid to go because Fiess every time he shoots, you\u2019re dead. I don\u2019t say a word. That\u2019s an interesting story. I know already what to do. I don\u2019t answer nothing. What is he going to do but ---. I says I\u2019m going, kill, kill me, what\u2019s the difference? He went over to that Fiess and he told me, and Heil Hitler, you know, break bodice. Hey, listen, I have by me such a good faulker and so on and so on but he\u2019s thinking he needs a lazarett. So let him go in. He says sh, sh. I won\u2019t guarantee, not in that barrack. I want him in the lazarett. That\u2019s the way he told me the story. I didn\u2019t hear. You stay tomorrow in lager and you will go to the lazarett and don\u2019t be afraid of nothing. Tomorrow they took me into that block 2, to that lazarett. Than that block 2 in lazarett in this bed was laying a man probably I have in the picture, that his sister, like that Stochman was from the men, the leader, his sister was from the women. Her brother was laying in one bed with something I sign here. They put me next to his bed and they also put me in something like 00 I don\u2019t remember what it was, asign. He, as he went to that camp in, how far was it? Across the street 17 from his location to run around to those people. Then he went to him to the lazarett in block 2 also. He comes in, he looks around and he goes away. he wanted, usually from there, they didn\u2019t take out. One day, I don\u2019t know that but that\u2019s what they told me, I was in the high fever. You have high fever, you shouldn\u2019t know from it, and you don\u2019t know where you stand. Let\u2019s say every morning he came in high bush, v how you feelo? Went away. He saw him going away already, thank God, but I was in very high fever. He came in and he asked something. Instead to say something, I swing with my arm. I don\u2019t know, till today I don\u2019t believe it but the next door man, when he get out, he said to my Uncle Morris, you know what your Brumula did? I don\u2019t know of nothing. When I swung like this, of course I didn\u2019t hit him, he said (female voice: he was delirious) in German, like the gendarme in German, du , that means you dog, a swine is like a pig, you had luck. If not for this, I don\u2019t know of nothing. I can\u2019t say nothing. I don\u2019t want even to put in the record because ----."

I stood and I worked, that\u2019s all. The same story, when it came that typhus and everything, Trawniki, what I mentioned, there is Pl another camp like this. We worked for Henklewerk.

There is standing already little pumps with gasoline to do us the same thing. People want already to jump on the wires. They say I rather get killed from the wire that he should kill me.

In the front, nobody want to go \u2014 all patriots up front. He\u2019s something, had a conversation with Lublin with Henklewerk there and Henklewerk stopped it.

They probably were afraid of the partisans because when we walked to work, a lot of times disappeared and so on and so on. They had to cross the main road and this and that. They brought in a little town what they were still in that town; they brought them in. so they started to disappear so they figured different. Why here, be there. They build another camp. It became, instead of camp, became KZ. That means concentration camp. A lot of them have the KZ. Instead I have the number.

We were there and when it started more with the war and so on and so on and Germany is squeezed so they started little by little to liquidate that camp. Because they figured and so on and so on. As I said what they did there, they brought tanks, one soldier, we had to fix in the tanks from the Ukrainians\u2019 Russia, they were pigs, dead ones. which we had a by that and so on and so on.

Let\u2019s say I had a complaint from you. I went in and I 19 complained to . In the nice Jewish way that ultimately they should know from it.

It\u2019s Majdanek the camp, but Majdanek had about ten fields. Each field was a camp. But this was also a field where the whole administrations are. The magazines with the and so on. Comes over a guy, here with a red triangle, red triangle is politicians. Green 1s like us. He was with a high vake. My name is Franz, I\u2019m an arrister. I am from this magazine but I am a prisoner just like you, he said. Arrister. He tells me, I was not in touch with Hitler, you know what that means? To kill him, politic.

It seems to me by the German, Abraham is Brumula, Brumula, fine. Who is he? I says, this is my father. You be the kapo he says, you know what means kapo. I am the kapo but you\u2019re going to be like the foreman of over those ten peoples. Say yes. Yes. I didn\u2019t like it. Then he calls me in in his magazine, whole magazine, shoes, clothing and everything. He has the two Russians; they standing with picks and picking these things. You see what they doing? I see. You know why they doing, he tells me. You going to pick like this and the picker don\u2019t go in, either bring 1t to me, whether it\u2019s a shoe or whether it\u2019s a garment or rip it and see what\u2019s there. Chances are there is gold. Do the same thing. I do, I do. I don\u2019t find nothing. He took me by the collar and threw me out. Go back to your place there. He brought in bread, this and that every morning, from where he got that bread or whatever, I don\u2019t know. Across the street was the magazine, there was an undersh , a German and another Ss man and there were three, four Polish guys, intellectuals from the colleges which they were also like prisoners but in a different way. They were working and this and that. They kept records and everything. Every morning, he took a wagon, those German wagons and he packed himself in. You could, you wouldn\u2019t recognize whether he has in the bag that thing or in the front with food with everything. He put clothing, dirty clothing and like horses,us, and we went to the vasherei to the washroom where the women worked. Our women there from our townspeople. He gave them 21 bread, water, marmalade this and that enough. Every day like this. I was the -- he said take a few guys. Anyway, one day he comes over to me. He gives me a boot and my uncle one boot. He says Brumula be careful, your father too. I need the upper soft -- the bottom, never mind. But you can look maybe. I start to pinch, it don\u2019t go. I\u2019m getting . Those Russians they were already experts. They saw already what -- and my uncle does it the same thing; happens to him the same thing. He don\u2019t know what I am doing. When he took out, there is a piece where they were laying in it. He took the pieces but this part of the shoe where it was inside, he threw it on the floor. Those Russians, they were so smarter, they were longer than us there; he picked it up. It was their foreman like I was by the Jew. He had one arm like this; he called him over and he shows him that and he says that means 14, 14 pieces. I saw this, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I get up from my chair and I go into the magazine and I says to him Frank, I found something here. How much/ I took out, not all of them. I kept by me three pieced and I give it to him. How about your father? I says I don\u2019t know. Before I says I don\u2019t know and I got back to my seat, that foreman from the Russian, he took down my number, it wasn\u2019t numbers yet, this is in Auschwitz but we had here a number and the uncle, he took down those numbers and went into the magazine and told the over there. He was a Polish-German, he spoke Polish what happened here. The minute he comes in and he calls my uncle\u2019s name, number, there was no names. Called him and an SS man behind him and they\u2019re taking him across the street in their office. I running to the magazine and says Frank, look what happened here. Don\u2019t be afraid. When they called him in, he took everything out and he put it on the table. You have no more? No. Those Polaks, those students back and they call him in. They call him in and that Frank, don\u2019t be afraid. He didn\u2019t ask me if I have something or I don\u2019t have something, nothing.
