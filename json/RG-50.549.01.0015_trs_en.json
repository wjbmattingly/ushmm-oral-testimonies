Because if I'll be je alous, it won't help me get that dress because I can't afford it if I don't have that three, five hundred do llars. And it won't make me happier if I'll have that dres s. And if I didn't pay for the dress, it would make me worse because why should I go with a dress that I owe the money and I don't know from where I will take the money.

No, it was, no. But to tell the true, I don't know. She, I think she taught me not to be jealous. And I don't want to be jealous, I'm happy. My sister-in-law says a lot of times, \"When will you change?\" She doesn't want me to be mean to her, to her I should be good, to othe r people I should be mean. She's also, she's very jealous if I'm nice with somebody. She wants to be the first. It's a character. It's like you want everything for yourself and I tell her, \"You are ad dicted to me\". She say, \"Yes\". It's a feeling that a person has. I'm not possessive, I don't want a person to be only mine, she can be everyone's person. But why be possessive ? Will it help? No. It won't help none to be possessive. So what can I hel p? I don't want to be possessive and I'll never be."
