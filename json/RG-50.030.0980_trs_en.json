Germans are attacking them. They come here eventually or maybe Polish army would defend them. Maybe French and Germans would attack from the west. The whole resistance was hinging on that promise cause otherwise Polan d realized it, its population realized that they didn\u2122t have any chance because the Germans who had huge amount of the very well, well trained, well equipped, quite modern arms, artillery, airplanes and so on. And so what happens here that my parents at the very beginning, after the first bombing, ple in that group, plus the owner of the big truck, Mr. Victor was his name. We packed our belongings within hours. Packed our belongings on the top of the truck and we are running towards Russia to escape Germans. On the roads and roads were narrow, whole traffic was mostly towards east. And there were columns and columns. Sometime trucks which were rarity. Small cars also rarity. Mostly was carts pulled by horses and people loading their belongings and there were columns as long as you can reach by eyesight. What German fire, the planes were doing. They were running along, flying along these roads and from the machine guns and also small bombs they were dropping on these convoys. So whatever it would have and we could distinguish between Polish aircraft and Interview with Wies 10 August 15, 2018 German aircraft. There was something different . And my task on the top of the truck was to look to the west and watch and listen for the so bringing attention of the adults and then what people were doing, they running quickly to the left and the right side leaving truck in the center of the road. And they were hiding in between the potato or rye or wheat you know whatever we could \u0152 or trees if it was nearby. And we\u2122re sitting there waiting until they go away because they came for a couple of minutes and they were gone and then nothing regular or they are not \u0152 unpredictable. This way we reached Russian borders which was Soviet Union at that time but we called it Russian. And since Russians enter Poland from the east on were at that time in Russia already, not d eep. And we are ordered to go back towards west, towards Poland itself w hich was still Poland but it was already occupied by Russians that territory. And not many people know that the Russia took re that. However the population density was much higher in the western territories which were eastern territories. Also eastern territories had much more minorities and so and Russia started to resettle Poles to Siberia, or to west, Kazakhstan , towards Siberia. They had to, were less organized than German but they had trains which were equipped with pig, with cars adapted to transport pigs. There were no passenger cars. And they were sent to which they later was called Kulaks, gulags."
