In about 45 years ago when I was already in this\ncountry, I acquired a nickname Wes, because it was easier for Americans to remember. So\nreturning to my date of birth, I was born on May 17, 1935. Iam 83 years old now. I was born\nobviously before World War Two in a small Polish town which was about half and half, Polish\nCatholics and Jews, mostly Orthodox. The, one of the most important things to know about this\ntown that was a very historic town which these two religions coexisted with the best harmony\none can imagine. There are no recorded incidents of any conflicts between these two religions in\nthat small town. And the town was located about 20 miles southeast of Warsaw. My mother\ncame to this town in 1929 or 1930. My father was born in nearby and lived most of his adult life\nin that, in town, or in concentration camps or in western Poland where he resettled.\n",

            "answer": "My father was born in year 1905 and my mother was born in 1910. So and they were, my mother came to town as I said from southern Poland which used to be called, before 1918, before Poland regained its independence was called Galicia which was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Those who know history will know that Poland didn\u2019t exist on the maps for about 125 years. And when it regained independence in 1918 was made up of three previously partitioned parts \u2014 Prussian on the west, Russia on the east, and Austro-Hungarian Empire on the south, which included Galicia."

            "question": "How did your parents meet? https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 4 August 15, 2018",
            "answer": "My parents met most likely if I can recall it well, in the post office of Gora Kalwaria. My mother was a teacher in nearby village. And my father at that time was working in the post office. My father was a bachelor at that time and he had great ease of communication with people so I am not surprised that they met. They married in 1931. I have beautiful picture showing their wedding and I was born four years later. My father was an accountant. He worked in the bank for some time and also in post office. And my mother was grammar school teacher. She was really gifted and praised by many parents for her exceptional human skills and ability to communicate with children and motivate children. So my first memories were started with the age about three. When my father was assigned a job, temporary job outside of our town and I was sent to the store and I already at that time had a good sense of humor. I was kind of the cracking jokes which I believe were told to me and then I think I remembered, but I\u2019m not sure which 1s it. My first major shocking experiences were related to the war because in 1939 at the beginning of September, when Germans were bombing Polish cities and they attacking Poland from the west, Warsaw was attacked relatively early by bombers. And although there was only 20 miles between Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria, German bombers apparently made mistake and they were looking for military objects. They bombed the residential part of our town, although there were military barracks on the other end of the town. They were all made of bricks, covered with the yellow shingles made of clay. And from the air they could have looked identical to the big hospital area which was next to my house. So they made a mistake and they dropped several bombs and one of them landed very near of my house where family of 11 people, escapees from Warsaw were hiding in. The escapees from Warsaw when they thought, they saved their lives by running from Warsaw. However, German bomb dropped on that house killed all of them, ten of them were killed. Only one person was saved."

            "answer": "So starting with my father, my father\u2019s family was -- it\u2019s a long history cause one of my uncles was keeping the history of our family. Unfortunately this book which was, hand written book, which was keeping notes was destroyed after the war. But what I remember was read to me was that Polish kings nominated in 17\u201c century, one of our ancestors, he was a general, Yosef Orlowski, as a commander of old town which had the medieval walls around it. And then there was water around, I\u2019m missing terms."

But it took him 11 and a half months by foot to get from Siberia back to the area which he lived near Warsaw. Meanwhile, all his property including quite an amount of land was confiscated by Russians so he had to start his life from square one. He managed to have two children, a boy and girl which were raised by somebody else because he became ill and he died very shortly afterwards.

            "question": "Does your mother\u2019s family have a colorful past just like that?",
            "answer": "Just returning to my father, to my grandfathers. They came from an impoverished nobility of medium kind of the level they had their own coat of arms and everything was recorded and my uncle was keeping these records which unfortunately were destroyed. On my mother\u2019s side. My mother came \u2014 my mother was raised on a small farm in the mountains. She I would call it, she was a mountaineer. I was visiting this area many times after the war and I met all her cousins. Family was rather big and when my father was born he was the oldest. He had three sisters. My mother had one sister and four brothers. And there were two or three who died because of the illnesses of the time and bad medical care obviously. So it was I would say strange combination of the history of these two families and I have to admit that my parents were not the best matched couple, as I see it, especially from the distance of time. However, I loved my both parents and when my father was arrested in 1943 in Warsaw, he was traveling between Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria often, and trading with different items. One of the most important items he was trading was golden coins because those who know life in Poland, during the occupation they would know that everybody was trading, even children. There was either barter or cash. Everybody knew value of everything else. All was illegal. Germans absolutely didn\u2019t allow trading unless it was sanctioned by them, by stores which they would https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 7 August 15, 2018 approve and you have to be either confident or some other, doing some other functions, useful for Germans. Or the trades was illegal. And, but everybody was really smuggling to survive. Jobs were very scarce. Food was difficult to obtain. Even if you had money, you couldn\u2019t enter the store and buy what you wanted. So my mother was an early \u2014 when my father was traveling between Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria, my mother was very involved in social movements. My mother was involved in the trade union, the labor union, teachers labor union. She was demonstrating in 1937, 8, I know from her memories. I was too small to remember that. There were demonstrations for higher salaries, for better working conditions and so on. Partially successful. During the war my mother relatively quickly joined underground movement which was led by Polish government in exile in London. It was pro-western, it was called Armia Krajowa [ph] in English. Actually 1t was AK in English was national army. Yes."

            "question": "Can you tell me about your mother\u2019s occupation as a teacher, what she taught and her role within the community?",
            "answer": "Before war, my mother was teaching grades one to five, I believe, four or five. And she was teaching all basic things. Usually teachers on that level they didn\u2019t have specialty so she was teaching history, geography, Polish language, less sciences. However, during the war, Germans- it was very lucky that in our town there were somehow more liberal. And we had two schools and each was \u2014 had classes one to seven. However, what I heard at the same time in different parts of Poland, they were allow, the classes were only from one to four. And obviously they would allow teaching history, geography, anything which would enlighten people. They wanted Poles to just read and write and do the basic calculus. They didn\u2019t, the all middle schools, all universities were all forbidden. However, there was a lot of underground schooling. There were regular classes in people\u2019s houses. Some of them denounced, people were arrested. Torture sometimes. There were all kind of sanctions, but many, many of the schools because of the solidarity between the people. Everybody was interested having the children educated in spite of German restrictions. Most of the schools I would say survived and there were all different levels. Diplomas were given. Exams were passed. It was just very normal and popular for -- and people were chipping in, in different ways. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 8 August 15, 2018 For example, the parents of this \u2014 for example my mother was giving tutorials after the regular school hours. There were, different kids are coming different days, different hours to my house and my mom was teaching them, helping them to catch up to the level which was expected and there were either less talented or they had harder conditions at home. Parents which are uneducated and they couldn\u2019t help them with homework. So my mother was fulfilling that role. And well she was paid with real goods, usually food. Like farmers cheese, homemade bread, eggs, carrots, onions, chickens sometime which was already plucked and ready to cook for soup or whatever. So we are relatively, relatively and there were periods of time when there was shortage of food, where there were no tutorials and they depended on detention and what was happening outside where, especially at the beginning of the war and just before the end of war, when they were first uprising in Warsaw ghetto and then Warsaw uprising of 1944 which were major upheaval for the Warsaw and the near surroundings where we lived."

            "answer": "Yes and no. There was some talks but most of the population were kept in the belief and that included Jewish population. I mean all citizens were kept under belief that 1f Germans attack. It was considered a, such a possibility, French and English are going to attack from the west because there were international agreements signed between the governments who were the western powers declare that if the Poland is attacked they are going to attack as well. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 9 August 15, 2018 However, what we learned later and obviously Hitler and his intelligence services had very good recognition of the mood and plans which French and German had and that\u2019s what I learned was later obviously when I was four, five, six years old I didn\u2019t know that. But I knew it shortly after the war. Germans kept 92 percent of their armies in the eastern front and there were absolutely vulnerable from the west. And Poles, Polish army and civilians were defending Warsaw for several weeks. Warsaw was encircled by German army but there were organized resistance. There was some w, ammunition and arms to protect Warsaw against the German army and it was very harrowing defense. However Germans had superiority in the air. They were bombing and they had superior tanks so in spite of the barricades and all these fortifications which were built around the outskirts, on the outskirts of, of center of the city, was conquered after several weeks."

            "question": "What was the response from your parents when the war began? Was there any talk about fleeing the area and going elsewhere?",
            "answer": "Yes, it\u2019s very good question because what happened here. After the first bombs were dropped on Gora Kalwaria, there was real -- start to be just somewhere else. Germans are attacking them. They come here eventually or maybe Polish army would defend them. Maybe French and Germans would attack from the west. The whole resistance was hinging on that promise cause otherwise Poland realized it, its population realized that they didn\u2019t have any chance because the Germans who had huge amount of the very well, well trained, well equipped, quite modern arms, artillery, airplanes and so on. And so what happens here that my parents at the very beginning, after the first bombing, organized a group of families, perhaps was six, seven people in that group, plus the owner of the big truck, Mr. Victor Balitzky was his name. We packed our belongings within hours. Packed our belongings on the top of the truck and we are running towards Russia to escape Germans. On the roads and roads were narrow, whole traffic was mostly towards east. And there were columns and columns. Sometime trucks which were rarity. Small cars also rarity. Mostly was carts pulled by horses and people loading their belongings and there were columns as long as you can reach by eyesight. What German fire, the planes were doing. They were running along, flying along these roads and from the machine guns and also small bombs they were dropping on these convoys. So whatever it would have and we could distinguish between Polish aircraft and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 10 August 15, 2018 German aircraft. There was something different. And my task on the top of the truck was to look to the west and watch and listen for the sounds and I was the one who was bringing attention of the adults and then what people were doing, they running quickly to the left and the right side leaving truck in the center of the road. And they were hiding in between the potato or rye or wheat you know whatever we could \u2014 or trees if it was nearby. And we\u2019re sitting there waiting until they go away because they came for a couple of minutes and they were gone and then maybe next time, whether it will be the same day or maybe three times next day. It was nothing regular or they are not \u2014 unpredictable. This way we reached Russian borders which was Soviet Union at that time but we called it Russian. And since Russians enter Poland from the east on September 17, we were at that time in Russia already, not deep. And we are ordered to go back towards west, towards Poland itself which was still Poland but it was already occupied by Russians that territory. And not many people know that the Russia took more territory in 1939 or September than Germans took before that. However the population density was much higher in the western territories which were eastern territories. Also eastern territories had much more minorities and so and Russia started to resettle Poles to Siberia, or to west, Kazakhstan, towards Siberia. They had to, were less organized than German but they had trains which were equipped with pig, with cars adapted to transport pigs. There were no passenger cars. And they were sent to which they later was called Kulaks, gulags."

            "answer": "They were scared by themselves so you know this is the time when children mature much faster than their chronological calendars. During the war my father was already in Auschwitz. My mother was part of this underground movement and during the day quite often when she was at work, my house looked normal. There was nothing unusual but on occasion, once every week, every two weeks on an irregular basis, we have a crew coming to our house. Crew, and those are the members of the same underground movement which my mother belonged and they were coming with the radio transmitter, receiver in pieces. Some of the pieces were hidden in our house. Some of -- they were bringing and putting together in minutes literally and they are starting communication by Morse code with radio base which was located on the outskirts of London. And they are communicating forth and back, sending information which 1s coded also besides the Morse code. They were also using some coded, so it was not easy. However, Germans knew about these stations, that they exist. However, they couldn\u2019t easily find them because they are villages, small towns. They couldn\u2019t be everywhere all the time so my task was that as soon as the station was ready to go, I was told to go outside, although I remember some time the Morse code I can hear it today (sound effects) are the key. My task was to go outside and I had friends who were fulfilling similar role, although some time they were, didn\u2019t know all the details, because we didn\u2019t talk among our self, all the details for obvious reasons. And was to look for the German, they look like a pick-up truck today, but it was a low truck, small truck, which dipole antenna which, the antenna which allows to determine from which direction signal is coming, from that station. So to determine where is exact location of that station, of the transmitter, they had to have two measurements from different angles. And then on the map they could identify very exactly which, almost which house, that this transmitter was located. So my task and my friends\u2019 task was to detect existence of this German trucks nearby and notify my mother one to another one were standing on the corners of the streets. So within seconds my mother knew there is a truck nearby. And my mother was running inside of our house and telling the crew. They were taking apart that radio station, hiding whatever they could, take the rest of https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 12 August 15, 2018 them and they obviously they are not running around the streets. They are going in the back of our house, through the orchards. Orchard to orchard. Orchard to orchard, never going through the town itself, but on the outskirts, through the dense whatever the forest and usually there were no Germans in this area. Besides they knew exactly where the concentration German where police headquarters. When they come into town they knew exactly where to go and not to go."

She knew how to shoot but she was not really specially trained. And there was not a role for the women. There was mostly role for men. The women had a lot of supportive roles. One of them, for https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 13 August 15, 2018 example was, and there was, as a part of underground movement, but also as the interest of my mother. Because as a teacher she had a lot of Jewish kids as her pupils. By average, her classes was around 50 percent of the kids were Jewish, before ghetto was created in 1940. For, and it existed for about half a year. So my mom had a lot of good acquaintances, I wouldn\u2019t say closest friends. But a lot of people who respected her and from both religions and including Orthodox Jews who, many of them they were sending their kids not only to cheder, Jewish school, but they sent them to the public schools, to the Polish because they were doing business. Most of the stores in our town were Jewish owned. There were excellent relationship between both religions and as I mentioned no accidents. So my mom was involved and at the very beginning there was a lot of smuggling going between Warsaw which was the biggest center where you could get food. Or from countryside farms, to the ghetto in Gora Kalwaria. Ghetto in Gora Kalwaria was very unusual because it did have sections with the barbed wire fences. However specially during the night, the traffic was unbelievable. That somehow people were able to bribe the guards which were part of Judenrat organization which was set up to communicate between Germans and the Jewish population."

And there is too many names to mention here, but they are people still alive, my peers or people who are already recorded in the archives of Holocaust Museum, like Mr. Felix Kartman and Mr. Avram Henrik Price. There are You Tubes, they are very detailed interviews with him. He, I was -- my mother was on very good terms with him. Last time I visited him about ten years ago, and I spoke to his sister a couple weeks ago by phone. This gentleman died in the age of 101 and a half. Unbelievably strong physically and mentally. He describes his life in great details and there is so much to be learned about his life and the life of other people."

By normal life I mean people are working in ghetto. People are trying to preserve food, to sell items.

They would be saved from \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to admit that this is any of kind of the organized massacre and they are going to be killed. Everybody had hope and as you well known that kept people going and living because once you remove the hope from human beings, the whole life doesn\u2019t make sense. So obviously there were moments when people becoming depressed or they stop to be positive and optimistic, but there was role of others to keep the spirit alive and so there were all kind of preoccupations, including small theater, singing groups, educational aspects, organizations were getting together and having discussions."

It\u2019s made of the sourdough bread which is added some aging, you know like you make kefir. Ferment. Went through the process of fermentation. So to get the essence of that I was coming to their house and bringing empty bottle, like one liter bottle. I was paying for it, whatever was asked. And then it was like a broth for making a soup. Potato was added and one of my (part of our?) when my mother was in school I was doing the cooking. I was preparing dinner. And my mother and \u2014 I was six, seven, eight year old but I was preparing dinner. My mother came from school quite often and either dinner was ready or not much left to finish the dinner.

At the beginning of ghetto when she was surrounded and she was forced to resettle and live in that ghetto, she escaped, like a lot of people did. But not high percentage. And she, and it was interesting that people who were escaping from ghetto, they either tried to be in countryside which was easier to hide. Living with a farmer like this gentleman, Henrik Price. He was adopted. He got the false document and he was adopted by a family of farmers who had son of similar age who didn\u2019t return from war.

And a long stick and that\u2019s the way they got on the other side of the river. The river was quite substantial and you could get in troubles if you tried to swim across. Anyhow so she went to another ghetto which was much more liberal so https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 17 August 15, 2018 to speak, much easy to get in and out and so on. And then again she escaped from there because he was able, he was working at the cemeteries of smaller towns and he found on the grave a name of the Polish woman and her name was Yanina, fitting the age. He went to the priest and he got falsified document for the name of Yanina, I forgot the name. And she was under that name til they got married, this couple but meanwhile there was not the end of this story. Meanwhile she was sent under the falsified name and there was Jews, not as much as non-Jews. They were sent to Germany to work on the farms because Germans were short of manual, menial workers. And so a lot of Poles, depending on the historian, but their calculation at least one million Poles worked on the farms in Germany during the war and were obviously all forced. They were paid a little bit, tiny bit, given food and shelter and many of them survive. And to the extent that the family of bakers who owned the bakery, German in the small town, they loved her so much that they were being ordered. They wanted to give the bakery to her. However she didn\u2019t want to stay in Germany. She returned after the war to Gora Kalwaria and she married my friend\u2019s uncle. Her name is Salome, or Solika they called her, her real name and again I forgot her real last name. But they had two children. They have children again and my friend was baptizing.

She very strongly believed in social justice, fairness and she was a real patriot. She wanted to help the country. Already had huge sacrifice by having our father not to be supporting family anymore, being tortured. And certain point we stop to get letters from him. We believe that he died. So when he showed up in 1945 was a huge surprise for us because there was no communication, no letters. We didn\u2019t expect at all. Basically everybody we buried him and say you know end. And then when he show up we are shocked."

Trains in our town were very, were narrow gauge. And it was going to Warsaw and then to another town, Gruyets. So was relatively, 20 miles in one direction, 20 miles other direction and it was very local, not connected with the regular gauge normal trains. But there were trains not far from us and this unit which was training them, they were going different places, having different tasks, including I was witnessing the report which they had a task, a nearby forest. There was a big opening which could have been turned into the grass field, runway for planes with the big tires which they were able to land and take off in the middle of the night so that task was on the, it was a big forest on the outskirts of the forest. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 26 August 15, 2018 These units were guarding whether Germans are nearby here.

I knew everything because out of boredom nobody was at home. I went to that hiding place what they are talking about to check whether this gun is still there. I was I self-trained myself. So after the war when German army left certain amount of arms. Whenever you went there were all these mines in the fields were a lot of arms here and there. Me and my friends were taking the arms and ammunition. We went into the trenches and there were nobody else there and we were doing full, full shooting like on the shooting range and we knew safely we could manage and nobody train us.

And a friend of mine, two years, three years older than me, a brother of good friend of mine. I just stopped to think a couple days ago. He was learning how to disarm that, these mines. And similar, his friends and their friends were hired by farmers which was I think cruel to let young people go into the fields. And they were many of them successful. Some, many of them survived, but some unfortunately made mistakes somewhere or they didn\u2019t know they stepped on a mine which were all hidden under the ground and they didn\u2019t have electronic equipment to detect it."

I saw him and he was killed and I was shocked, but I could have been one of them. So I was lucky during the war because every day when we are leaving home in the morning, we were not hundred percent sure that we were going to be back that evening. Threat of being killed was very real and so many, many incidences where people were killed, either because they didn\u2019t stop when they told to stop. They had something hiding on their body or something and they want to be discovered or simply Gestapo didn\u2019t like or they already knew this person or whatever and they were looking for him.

Under their movement which I think it\u2019s the main explanation. A lot of institutions which were, had German names and had to do with the Polish population who had to do with rations. We had, food was available with coupons. You were getting coupons. So many kilograms of sugar per month or per week and one loaf of bread per week per head. These organizations were, had employees which are Polish origin and many -- I wouldn\u2019t say majority but some of these positions were infiltrated by Polish underground movement. People who secretly worked for Polish underground movement. And they will bring information and early enough my mother was informed there is an opportunity to get a document to do the function which was collecting weather, like rain, snow, the amount observation of the sky when the clouds, how low, when sun and she was, she got a book written in German called and every day at certain hours you had to fill. Sometimes in German, simple words. I don\u2019t remember now but and the numbers. Hours and the amount, how many centimeters of rain that night was and so on. And this information was collected by meteorological service, German, which were used by German Luftwaffe. German military efforts. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 30 August 15, 2018 That gave my mother an Auswise, the document which we call it IDcav today was the picture or in German and that whenever she was traveling between Gora Kalwaria and Warsaw and she was traveling sometimes to take big round yellow cheese, which she was getting at a very low price and she was selling it in Warsaw in certain place. Sometime that cheese had inside underground documents. And my mother was having in a suitcase. She was very fashionably dressed, had perfumes. She knew quite well German. And she was traveling and she recalls one specific case when she was standing on the tramway stop. Tramway came. One section of the tramway nor fila Deutsche, was German officer seeing a lady who 1s trying to lift the suitcase. So he helped her to enter Polish section, put her luggage on the shelf above the head and then it went to Deutsche section. He didn\u2019t realize that he is lifting underground army\u2019s literature, hidden in the cheese inside."

Whether my life is in jeopardy or how to read what eyes don\u2019t see, so to speak. There were no newspapers, no radio. Germans were communicating with Polish population by hanging two language posters explaining you know such and such a day new regulations.

But sometime was not sufficient. They had you know they all kind of relationships. German to survive in Poland locally, they had to somehow relate. They couldn\u2019t be just suiting left and right. They needed food, they needed labor. The ghetto itself had assignments. The Jewish authorities, Judenrat authorities had assignments. So many people they need for work. Every day different people. Sometimes people worked two, three times a week. Sometimes were paid a little bit, others were not paid. They all varied but assignment was they needed. So for road work, for some other repairs, for some help with bringing food, here or there. Last was food because with food, people would be stealing food so they tried to separate food from people. But they didn\u2019t have enough people of their own. Soldiers had tasks in the army or they went to the front, eastern front. They had to coexist somehow. So they tried to bribe people by promises. But as you know all the \u2014 most of the people who cooperated openly or the Jewish police which was guarding ghetto in Gora Kalwaria. They were the last one to be packed in the last cart and they were sent to Warsaw ghetto and then to Treblinka and you know other -- to gas chambers. Germans didn\u2019t feel loyal towards those who were cooperating with them. But at the time when they need it, they found all these people who were willing to cooperate. Those were the times. It was interesting. Let me tell you just one thing. My mother had the observation that in war time is the time when you have the opportunity to recognize who are good people, who are bad people. That among our acquaintances, friends, acquaintance of the acquaintances, people who would expect to be honest to be fair, to be real human beings, with empathy were surprised. Those were expected, they passed the exam so to speak and people whom we treated with thoughts that they are not worse to have respect, they became real heroes. Really honest people who so to speak passed the exam of humanity. And that was one of the major lessons which my mother and I learned, that the real people you recognize when real test, real need comes in life. That people have different recaniam, different layers and you have really to know the essence of a human person is to remove all these layers first. And the war is the time when real test on the characters of the people. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 34 August 15, 2018"

            "answer": "So in 1943, during the Warsaw ghetto, before the Warsaw ghetto uprising, I was in Warsaw several times. My mother was coming, doing some trading and visiting friends. We had some friends in Warsaw and on several occasions my mother took me and we walked along the walls of the ghetto. There was a section, I forgot the name of the street, but I could reconstruct it where the cobblestone pavement of the street, sidewalk on outside street paved, and then the wall of the ghetto was almost on the edge of the street, or very narrow sidewalk. The wall on that section was, had no windows and you can see the signs where windows were removed and the holes were filled with the brick. The walls were I would say about 8 meters, eight yards, about tall. I didn\u2019t see anybody on the top. There were barbed wires on the top, but at the bottom where once in a while there were small narrow windows, which had iron bars densely installed that a person, no maybe cat could sneak in but a person couldn\u2019t. But often when we are in the same area, we saw children\u2019s heads sticking out, outside through that window and they were either, they would see quite often people walking on the other side and they were showing that give me something, give me something. And not far from there was a stand with vegetables, where you can buy carrots, onions, celery, something which you can you know person can eat raw and on several occasions my mother with as little money as we had, were buying couple carrots and I exclusively, my mother was observing when the gendarmes were walking their backs towards, back another one. So it means they walking away and they were not opposite direction and they were not looking at us on the sidewalk on the other side of the street. And we are throwing these carrots and these kids were grabbing them and eating them. You can see them. They were very hungry and every piece of carrot was consumed almost on spot. You can see how was appreciated. So my mother, I think she did it for, that she could throw it our self, but she was giving it to me to teach me be empathetic and help other children. Children helping children. There was, on several occasions I remember that we are doing. And also my being was our standing on the tram stop. It was like a raised area and in one particular place there was Ulitsa Puovska [ph] and there was like tramway place where they were, hangar where there were https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 35 August 15, 2018 several trains were ready to, they were stored there temporarily.

And this particular day afternoon, sunny day, a truck comes and there were soldiers come from the cabin and truck is covered and full of the prisoners. And they commanding them to get out. They putting them against the wall and one with the machine gun, kills the entire row. And other prisoners are asked, another truck comes and asked to take these bodies with hands and legs. You know one person holding legs and \u2014 to throw them on that truck and they were taking them away. After they left, we couldn\u2019t, we\u2019re encircled by the police so we couldn\u2019t go.

They did it in public places, purposely to spread a fear. To spread the, to tell people watch it because if you don\u2019t behave you will be killed as they are. That was the message that they wanted to send and so it was interesting reaction of the people. Once, of the people who were watching that, once -- because we are very close. We are I would https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 36 August 15, 2018 say less than hundred yards from that. Not always every of these prisoners who were killed on spot. Sometimes they were moving so Germans were still walking around and they were shooting in their head here and there. From the, you know hand gun. Once that show ended the trucks went and police freed us to proceed. Trams were not moving, traffic was stopped for that execution time. There was, I don\u2019t know, maybe 20 minutes, something like that, lasted. Then they restored the traffic and then people were going to the execution place and the walls were full of blood. Blood was in the street, curb where the rain normally goes, how do you call it?"

We have Zen meditation, here once a week. but I did it every day, twice a day sometimes, just to restore my senses because it\u2019s deeply, deeply disturbing experience just to talk about that. This is not somebody\u2019s else story. It\u2019s not a movie which one saw. This is, was my life. My childhood which I basically didn\u2019t have because I didn\u2019t have normal play. I, yes, we did try during the war sports. I was very achieved, hundred meter dash, runner. Javelin champion and triple jump and long jump and high jump and -- were my specialties. Yes, sports helped a lot but still didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what would be if was not that sport. I don\u2019t know if I had to be just with my thoughts. So yes I did, I recognized the importance of physical movement, being in the nature and so on and today I am struggling with my memories. So it\u2019s not easy experience. Not easy to talk about that but I think it\u2019s important that other people my age and even younger who still remember what similar experiences they had in their life that it\u2019s passed to the next generations so wars will be forbidden by law. I\u2019m smiling at this point, but people will fully realize the consequences of the war. This is not that only people die on spot, that people were buried, that people lose their members of their families. They are injured physically but the injury, the mental injury so to speak which stays perhaps even more than one generation."

Wes, we ended our last conversation talking about the end of the war but we want to back up a little bit to talk about your father\u2019s experiences when he was deported to Auschwitz and then spent time in different camps. Wes Orlowski: Yes, so my father was outside of our home about 25 kilometers from us in center of Warsaw when he was arrested by Germans, taken to the temporary headquarters where he was tortured. They didn\u2019t extract much from him because he didn\u2019t know what they were expecting him to know. And then he was transported to Auschwitz and \u2014"

In Auschwitz, depending on the period of time by, but by the end of war, Germans were more lenient, when it comes to the, allowing families, prisoners and prisoners them self to communicate between them self. So we are allowed that by the end of war to send some short letters, written in German and small packages. Packages had to be limited in size and weight and mostly vegetables which he had to share with his inmates, that were in the same room where \u2014 the particular one which I visited years, many years later, he was, they had bunk beds in one room. Eleven of them and so when he received the parcel he, as well as if they did, they had to share it with the inmates."

It means shortly before he was deported to Mauthausen and then shortly after he arrived in Mauthausen. So my father survived both camps, through several, because of several factors. One of them he knew some German but he was learning very fast due https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 40 May 23, 2019 to the presence -- he befriended some people there who knew German and they were kind of self, teaching themselves, so my father was participating in this informal classes. Second, he was relatively healthy. He was entrepreneurial because in files I found that he was listed as a gardener. I never knew that my father had any talent for gardening, but he was gardener in Auschwitz. And then what I knew was that he had skills as an accountant and they employed him in the office for keeping some records, probably you know suitcases, shoes and whatever. They, as we know, Germans are very systematic and they were keeping records of everything. So my father survived and they were also, he had some access to the kitchen as a help. And then everybody in the kitchen you try to steal as much as possible so you can have food later. Everybody was doing that. There are some reports. My father didn\u2019t do that but people who were wearing, carrying bread in their pockets til the end of their life, long time after the liberation. And they were, you know 50 years later but they are still carrying bread in their pockets.

And so I received, I still preserved one letter from before leaving the Auschwitz and then I have one letter which was sent to sister of my mother. She lives, she lived in Silesian region which was southern Poland, much closer to Austria. And that was written obviously in German with both cases there are his numbers which he had engraved on his hand, he mentioned.

My father somehow was able to survive all these atrocities and later he told me and I complemented my knowledge by reading more about that. The conditions for, in, for prisoners in Mauthausen were much, much worse than in Auschwitz. Mauthausen was considered one of the most severe German camps where first prisoners and the camp was set already after the, on the Anschluss but Austria invaded 38 I believe. They started this camp in the quarry. They digging huge, huge area of quarries in the side of the mountain to prevent this place to be bombed by the enemies\u2019 bombers. And there were the entire parties. The planes they were built there. The ammunition was put together from the parts. There were, they worked into shifts. Sometimes three shifts, taking turns. The prisoners were very poor. The average life span for the prisoner in Mauthausen was two months. And my father survived seven months and was liberated in 1945 on May fifth by a unit of US Army."

There were a lot of what you would call today PTSD, was not known at the time. But all forms of that kind of trauma was engraved deeply.

But nearby there was a big artillery unit, German. And there was aiming obviously towards east against Soviets. Then certain day in the morning we see they are turning their guns aiming to the west, 180 degrees reversal and we were completely shocked. Well what\u2019s -- they will be shooting their own units. Then we realized that they were ready to defend against the encircling, which took place. The Russians broke the front. At the beginning of January. Eventually the liberation of Warsaw took place on January the 17\", 1945. But before that these German units which were in our neighborhood in the countryside, they were aiming towards west. They are not shooting at that time, but they were aiming towards west. Because Russian army already encircled them from the, from the west. The only open area where they had is towards Warsaw, towards north. So they eventually put the stuff together. They hooked their artillery units to the trucks and they left towards north.

They were not accepted officially by the communist authorities because they were specially history books you know. In math or biology you cannot change much, but history books they were no, no for the communist times. The communist authorities. So a lot of teaching was based either from these fragments of the books which were left by, saved by the teachers. Or from their memories. Or teachers were teaching one another Some of that, depending who was behind the pack, who was unofficial and they were kind of the -- between the real facts and phantom history which communists wanted to teach. And the history as the older people knew. History is not only what is in the books but what\u2019s in people\u2019s memory, especially older people\u2019s memory. So there were very difficult times. My mother was very involved in the teachers union. Before war she was participating in demonstrations in Warsaw. But after the war there was obviously the teachers union, labor union was penetrated by communists. They were open or secret agents. So we need to learn quickly who to speak to what extent. We had to learn how to read between the lines what\u2019s in newspapers. We had to learn quickly not to believe official propaganda. We have to learn quickly how to, man or woman, a radio receiver and how to listen to radio Free Europe or BBC from England.

Several transmitters on different frequencies and to learn that the Polish authorities are having radio stations on the same frequency located in Poland which does, were sending huge noise garbled up and noise mechanical noise which the purpose of that was just to squash the regular signals coming from Radio Free Europe from Germany."

So to speak, symbolically. And people who we had high esteem appeared not worse you know opinion so to speak because they became either selfish or they became agents you know and they were ready to spy on you and report to authorities.

            "answer": "This was an interesting process. There was a dynamic process. And to the extent that these things are written and I witness the situations like that. People who were discovered by the Polish underground movement during the war, that they were cooperating with Germans and they were caught and proven, they were taken on the side somewhere in the, outside of everybody\u2019s view and they were shot and killed by the special units of Polish underground movement and it was very obvious reason. To give a lesson to rest of the society that it\u2019s not the approved way of behaving. Plus they had to be removed because they are doing so much damage and so many people lost lives because of the people like that. So yes, they were, there are all kinds of the behaviors. There are people who were indecisive that then became very cooperative. People who were cooperative and they change their mind and they became selfish. There were trial periods for everybody. Everybody was certain way exposed and tested. And there was nobody basically who could stay in their comfort zone and stay unengaged in any way."

            "answer": "Yeah, so my education started from self-education. So when my mother was giving tutorials, I was sitting playing with my toys in the other room. Doors were open. I was on the floor and my mother didn\u2019t know that I am absorbing everything what she was teaching there like a sponge. To the extent when I was ready to go to the first grade, teachers who were examining me, they said no you can go to second grade and you are, you know more about that. So my mother herself was surprised but I went to the second grade and from the, from that second grade to the end of my high school, I was always to the last class, I was always a best student. I had the best grades. However, in the last two years of my high school there was an older than all of us, young man came and he was studying in the seminary for priest. And he knew Latin like nobody else. He knew French like nobody else. And he was good but not as good as I was. But I had quite a https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 49 May 23, 2019 problem because I was accustomed to be the best. There were all kids who were coming to me with you know problems to solve or something. I was helping. I was not selfish. I was very helpful to other students. However in that last just before graduation I had problem with competing with this young man. As I said he was four, four or five years older than us and he had so much schooling in that seminary so anyhow. To get, I graduated from high school in 1952, the same year I applied to Warsaw Polytech to the department of electronics which was a direction, well 1f young men ask older men where he should go and the movie Graduate I believe you would say plastics. At that time it was electronics was a popular direction everybody wanted to learn about electronics. And we had competitive exams. I went through that. I started studying in, 1t was 11 semester program. There was an experimental program where we couldn\u2019t get a BS, bachelor of science. We had to go for a masters. So in one chunk without interrupting there was the first course of that entire college. I had to go and for master\u2019s degree. So after almost ten semesters, when I was done with my regular study at the class, where it was the time to write dissertation, myself and two of my closest friends, we started to work in industrial institute for telecommunications. And was semi military institution but was a lot of work there for civilians. In our case we are doing parts for radars which were later installed on commercial ships and ocean going ships. So they were, when I was writing my dissertation, I had to do a lot of translations from literature, not only in English but in French and I was fluent in French at that time. In Russian, in Italian, and obviously in Polish so I had to be in, from the technical translation point of view, fluent in five languages."

But then he was taken to Auschwitz. That didn\u2019t prevent two contractual workers from France. One was of Russian origin and the other was of Polish origin. I remember even names.

So he and his family escaped to Paris. And he was educated there so he was fluent in Russian and I remember he was talking a little bit of Russian to me, both of them talking French and Mr. Stanislaw Malinowski was knowing Polish but kind of the broken Polish. So an interesting conversation at the table. They were bringing me some food with them. They were cooking together. And they were for example first time I ate frog, the frog legs.

Then my mother\u2019s colleague, teacher of the French. It was 1944, 45 and 46. I was coming to her home and helping her to, with the chores, household chores and she was speaking French exclusively to me. She wouldn\u2019t allow me to speak Polish. So I was quite fluent. I didn\u2019t know much grammar but I was fluent in everyday talk. I, you know, simple sentences. And eventually I was learning in school grammar. So when I graduated high school I was good in Latin, four years of Latin, four years of formal schooling, high school in French. And the learning Russian caught with me only in college. First time I had to go which was unusual. My times, most of the high schools and regular schools had to have Russian. Somehow my school, my high school omitted or they were able to avoid teaching that. They didn\u2019t have teacher and it was not popular, Russian. That was very helpful for me. French, but English I started to learn preparing my dissertation but it was very, my master\u2019s degree dissertation was 56, 57, 58, 59 I graduated.

There was everything helpful until the -- all my life foreign languages were saviors and I was many time in my life, I was lucky. I would say. Among other things I was in right place, right time. That was part of the luck. But I developed the skills for languages and also human skills. I think coming from the training during the war and after the war and balancing acts which we had to all of the time, whom to trust, to what extent and how to build relationships and friendships and how to value real relationships, the real friendships.

Small cities, small towns are in the kind of the dream certain way. Everybody knows everybody. They have set of expectations you have to follow. In big cities people disappear. They don\u2019t really care for neighbors anymore. They can be on same corridor, have doors and they don\u2019t say good morning to one another. They pretend that they don\u2019t, they avoid other people. This is not the case. Warsaw at that time had a lot of population coming from smaller cities and from countryside. So these people brought a culture of small town, plus the experience the older generations you know of the war. People were much more friendlier, helpful, paying attention one to another, not being afraid to look into other people\u2019s eyes. When I came to this country one of the first warnings I was told not to look into the eyes of young men especially. Being a young man because that\u2019s considered as a challenge.

And I had several of those on the, at my first year of college. They were sons usually or daughters of communist activists. In my case I had several colleagues who were children of the communists expelled from Belgium and France and they were sent to Poland. For their activities, communist activities. They wound up in Poland. They had children and these children got without the exam special exemption. They became the students at the elite best of the best schools. One could get.

There were activists with the bands on their arms, marking they are activists of the youth organization and they were boarding so nobody could run away from that march.

            "answer": "Yes, as it happens because of my age. I was 19. I was 35 years old, 34 when I interviewed in American embassy. Very rigorous interview, in our language obviously. And what I was doing, research and I was not member of any organization since that when I was expelled from the \u2014 usually I never was member of the communist party, of this workers thing. I was not involved so that was probably helpful and they were interested what I was doing in my research. I had to document everything and, from my supervisors and all of it. And I was sent home and they told me they will notify me soon and there was no word for many, many months. I went on vacation next year. I returned from vacation. That was August 1970 and I was told that I was approved and I should leave in two weeks. So I had two weeks\u2019 time to put my ducks in a row. Make order in my desk and leave the work which I was doing with somebody else and for one year I was traveling from monetary \u2014 for one year I was allowed to buy the ticket. I believe I bought the ticket or was offer. I don\u2019t remember at this moment. But the Fulbright fellowship was extremely low. When I arrived in United States, I barely had enough money to pay one room in dorm like situation. But it was private house where I shared the house with ten other students, one kitchen, one refrigerator. Maybe one or two bath, two bathrooms for 11 people. Walking distance to the college and I had to skip some meals in cafeteria because I didn\u2019t have enough money. There was like 300 something dollars per month, for to pay my dorms. Tuition was paid obviously. Cause I couldn\u2019t pay tuition from that. But I remember going to McDonald\u2019s was a luxury for me. I couldn\u2019t have afford. I had to buy bread, simple foods. Do my own sandwiches for lunch. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 60 May 23, 2019 Eat very simple breakfast. And for dinner was big treat to go cafeteria and have a simple meal. So it was really, really you, you hear that somebody 1s on Fulbright fellowship, maybe now they are paying them. But for us, when I arrived in 1970 was so discriminatory and, and awful my fellowship. I learned later from boys from India, from other countries who came, it was unbelievable simple life style. What I had to endure."

But she acknowledged it and that was one of the curious points. Anyhow, by mistake I learned it later. I was put on the regime which was very unusual. There is this science, this gentleman, the professor who was my guide so to speak. And then there was one like student advisor for the entire university. They applied a wrong paragraph from some regulation book. I was treated as Soviet diplomat. I was not a diplomat. I had passport which I, yes, there was not my private passport. Passport was the property of the government. When I was going to return to Poland, I had to, next day to return the passport because passport at that time was not my document. It was official document of the government. Although it\u2019s my photograph, my \u2014 but anyhow, they applied this new rule by mistake. I learned later.

She 1s using for many years now only this. Because it\u2019s more convenient. What\u2019s interesting is that because of the agreement between the governments, US and other countries signed an agreement that if US is going to grant Fulbright fellowship, these grantees cannot apply for US citizenship or even for green card. And I was only you know I did time was started to be counted from the day of the departure of this guarantee from the US. So when I departed what counted on me that\u2019s several months I was in Poland and there were supposed to be 24 months period. So in spite of being married to the US citizen, I was not able to be with my wife. So they recommended what they, that I will go to Canada, let\u2019s say. And she will come to Canada or, stupid restriction. Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State at that time. So this was restriction by State Department which was the one which was issued the Fulbright Fellowship.

I became more, the equipment which was used for civilian purposes but also for military purposes. And that was becoming difficult for me. I became more thinking a line of Quakers which I met a lot of Quakers and I became Quaker about 30 years ago. And that changed my life in many ways. My wife and my son are Quakers. We are very active in Great Barrington. So you know views change and I was changing to. I was as I call it going forward. Instead looking back. But my past is very colorful and you had a lot of difficult times which I had to overcome in many ways. And enjoy every day as it comes instead looking too much in the past. There was too many things in my childhood and in my early age, including as I often say I was able to survive two totalitarian systems. One German occupation when police had to pay attention. We in Poland we didn\u2019t use the word Nazi occupation as it\u2019s used over in this country. We were saying German occupation because it was Germany was occupying, not Nazis. Nazis was a party that took control of Germany, but there was Germans. Germany couldn\u2019t conduct the war without support of majority of the country. And the sons and daughters were dying on behalf of Germany, not Nazis. And I wanted to emphasize it again and again because it\u2019s a very strong falsification of the history. This is not the way history 1s being seen in Eastern Europe. When I hear there was a Nazi occupation of Poland I am getting kind of the goose skin, because when I was leaving home I would have been killed by a German soldiers or you know Gestapo. I didn\u2019t care whether he https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 64 May 23, 2019 was Nazi or not Nazi. Nobody in Poland was really paying attention to whether it as Nazi or not Nazi. My father was tortured and taken concentration camp was not important for him whether Nazis or not Nazis. He was beaten, kicked and, and was losing teeth because of beating and not because you know Nazis or not Nazis. He was beaten by Germans. That\u2019s a very strong powerful point for me but I wanted to make it because there is so much of distortion of the history. Only eyewitnesses can tell the truth. And all historians who didn\u2019t experience that they can have all kinds of the fantasies, they can write all kind of the things, but we in Eastern Europe we learned how to read between the lines and what\u2019s the truth and what\u2019s the falsification afterwards. One of the reasons I am giving this interview 1s I want to present the facts as they were at the time, not as they are being seen from the perspective of 50, 60, 70 or 80 years. Because there is no substitute of living facts. Experiencing on your own body. And there 1s no, there is no substitute for oral histories. I think what the museum 1s doing is extremely, extremely important. To have eyewitnesses. Yes, they might be sometimes colored by individuals but, but they are giving a sense of the times. You cannot publicate what I am saying here. Those are all my personal experiences, or they were through my friends, my family, whom I trust. They were not told to me by somebody, occasionally at the -- you know bar drinking beer or whatever. So they could be colored by somebody being tipsy you know or purposely distorting the truth. No, those are the facts you know. They are part of my life in living memory."

And we were doing, it was the beginning of the chips and, and computers. There were mini computers, small computers because there were PDF 11 already at that time which was like a big refrigerator, big refrigerator really. And those are many of them in NVA department at Yale. However, people needed custom made like you would call it laptop with special features today, much more primitive than today\u2019s laptops you can imagine. But anyhow there was 70s and we are pioneering the work of custom made. I remember the CPU units the heart of the computer coming in the book where was it was cellophane. It was kind of glued to the page, the rigid page and you had to cut it out and you know find the appropriate sockets for it and then build everything from with the resistors, capacitors and there was iron, hot iron you know and solder. You were building it on the printed board. Those are the electronics, basic electronics at that time. So there were interesting times. My interest gradually was shifting, when I was already at Yale, towards the use of the alternative sources of energy, I was interested in solar wind and micro, micro, hydro small hydro which you can install in streams you know you don\u2019t need big river for that. So I started with a friend of mine who was graduate of Yale School of Architecture, we started an organization called ATAG, appropriate technology assistance group and we are giving consulting to the individuals and organizations which were interested in using like windmill or having solar collectors which were very expensive at the time, not like today."

Just electricity. Because they were huge hogs of electricity so this is the, utilities started with these houses and, and buildings which were exclusively supplied with electricity.

And it\u2019s a lot of things to be learned from other people. One of the most shocking things for me to find when I arrived here in the United States in 1970 was the lack of the appreciation by younger, appreciation of the other generation and their experience by younger generations. The gap between certain age groups is I think very damaging for society and culture as it is. And societies as they are, are losing a lot without consulting what they are doing with the older generations. And I think it\u2019s a huge mistake, culturally. I think huge mistake in educational system that schools are not encouraging older people to come be tutors. The, you know younger generation, they think they know everything and they know better and they have no respect of older people. So they gap between grandparents, children and especially grandparents and their grandchildren is in my opinion unacceptable. That needs to change because it\u2019s a question of survival of, of the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Wieslaw (Wes) Orlowski 68 May 23, 2019 nations, of people as they are and not to speak about environment which needs to be respected. But I would start with the restoring the bridges, crossing the bridges which are huge, huge gaps between the generations. It just I\u2019m sure it change in Poland as well, but this was not my youth and not my middle age but I was growing up. The respect for older people was much higher in Europe. In general in Poland. The family links were much stronger and friendships and intergenerational communications and the respect and just spending time together and talking, talking about how was it. To learn something from that. Not to repeat the same mistakes. Again and again. And I am observing that too many there are many things would be, could be avoided if younger generations were more open learning from older generations. That\u2019s my main message which I would like to convey to younger people."
