This is an interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on November 23rd, 1998, in Woodmere, Long Island.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape one, side A. This 1s a brief ambiance in the home of Frima Laub. This 1s a few seconds of silence in Frima Laub\u2019s home. There 1s, in the background, all sorts of, I guess wind blowers. They are -- It\u2019s a beautiful fall day and neighbors are taking the opportunity to clean off the leaves. So, we are starting, along with the lawn material, which we will forget about. I wanted to ask you first, Frima, if you could give me your full name as a child and the name of each of your immediate family members and just a little bit about them. Maybe where you all were at first.",

Okay, before the war, we live in a very lovely city, by the name of Volachisk -- I\u2019m sorry, not Volachisk, Proscurov, which is near Volachisk and Potvolachisk, where the rest of my relatives were born. Some were born in Volachisk, some were born in Potvolachisk. But, we moved when I was still a little girl. We moved to Proscurov, which is a larger city."

            "question": "We-We\u2019ll -- We\u2019ll return later to your relationship with your -- your family members, but first, I wanted to ask you some of the things, just to clear up from the 1990 interview that was done at the Holocaust Museum. Did you have any idea of what year it was, or how old you were when you first stayed alone with the Gentile woman?",
            "answer": "Yes, that was in 1942, after the second pogrom in Proscurov. This is where -- My mother felt that she had to leave the city, of course, with my sister -- at that time, we didn\u2019t know where m -- our father was. And my brother, of course, we didn\u2019t know where he was, since he was in Kiev, since before the war -- the war started. So, that was after the second pogrom, when my mother felt everybody was killed in the city and she had to run away because they were searching for remaining Jews. So, that\u2019s when she left me with that Gentile lady. So, I was six years old, little bit over six, yeah."

            "question": "And I had a question -- two questions, actually, the first one being, do you know -- do you understand now and did you understand then, why your mother left you alone?",
            "answer": "It\u2019s such a interesting question. Did I understand? I -- Obviously, I must have understood something when she said, \u201cYou have to stay here. I must leave with your sister. But,\u201d she said, \u201cin the spring, someone will come to get you and bring you to me, wherever I\u2019m going to be.\u201d A-And as much as I didn\u2019t like the thought that my mother was leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was crying and my excuse was, \u201cMama,\u201d I says, \u201cbut I have a headache.\u201d Cause I felt, maybe if I tell her I have a headache, she will stay. And she said to me, she said, \u201cThe lady will give you an aspirin, and you'll feel better. And here.\u201d She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, \u201cIn case you want to buy yourself something and you need money.\u201d So she gave me the hundred rubles and she kissed me goodbye, she walked out. Now -- She walked out, I -- I guess there was something that I must have understood when she said, \u201cI must go, and I can\u2019t take you along,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it is too cold outside.\u201d\u2019 And -- And 1-in Europe, the winters are extremely cold. You can really freeze. And -- And I had very little clothing, because that clothing wasn\u2019t even mine, it was the clothing that belonged to somebody else from the first pogrom yet. So, I guess, in the way, I understood that it\u2019s cold outside and I might get sick or freeze and my mother said she must leave and I knew one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to escape. So, that was my understanding, and I didn\u2019t make a scene. I just said, \u201cMy head hurts.\u201d That\u2019s all."

As the years went by, I guess somebody would say, \u201cOh, Ma, you left me.\u201d or \u201cYou abandoned me.\u201d I never felt that way. And I just never discussed it with her and I -- but I did asked her, when we were reunited and she held me on her lap -- see, now I remem -- I remember, and my first question was, \u201cMama, why did you leave me?\u201d That I did, yeah. And she just explained to me again what she said, \u201cI had to leave, 1t was too cold and I was afraid if I take you, you might freeze to death.\u201d\u2019 Cause even the clothe -- my clothing consisted of knee-highs and a pair of short boots. A little skirt, a sweater and a little jacket with a scarf, that\u2019s it."

            "answer": "W-We lived in this very, very small town, it was occupied Romania and I understand this was still part of the Ukraine, but it was next to Romania and they call it occupied Romania. Mostly, there was a handful of Gentile people with a few homes, and -- a-and farms -- fields, they had a lot of fields. And this handful of Jewish people lived with the Gentile families, like we did. We lived with this Gentile gentleman. We were two families in one of his rooms, because that\u2019s all he had 1s one room. And -- And he slept on top of the brick oven and we had -- yeah, our life wasn\u2019t that simple. There was no bathrooms, either. If you had to go to the bathroom, you had to go out in the fields. Those days, things were not the way they are today. And so there was one bed, on -- on that bed there was a mother and a daughter whose fingers were a bit froze -- yeah, frozen from -- from the cold -- yeah, from the cold weather. They were trying to hide and wherever they hid, they obviously were not dressed properly."

So, they slept on one -- it wasn\u2019t really a bed, it was one of those four legs and -- a-a-and -- and some hay on it, I mean, that was the bed. And we had another bed, which was a little bit bigger, because my mother, myself, my sister and then later on, a cousin of ours joined us, too. So we all slept on the same bed and instead of sleeping horizontally, we slept diagonally. And if there wasn\u2019t enough room, so one of us will sleep on the floor. A-And that was o-our quarters. Now, what we did is -- is -- we had no money to pay for our -- our rent. So, we worked for this gentleman. Of course, we were very grateful, the fact that he even gave Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection us a place where to sleep -- where to sleep. So, we worked on his -- on his fields and I was one of his workers, and my job was to -- with my fingers, I would have to dig out the potatoes from -- you know, from under the earth. And I cleaned them up, put them in a sack and tied the sack and then, you know, just so -- drag it to his warehouse, which I don\u2019t know how many blocks it was exactly, I never counted it. To me, it was just part of my life. And for that, he would give me a loaf of black bread. So, we didn\u2019t have to pay for the rent and he gave me a loaf of bread and that was a tremendous salary."

You wo -- just would have to be very careful 1f sometimes a German would pass by 1n the street, you understand? Or -- Or someone, some other Gentile would know that you were Jewish, he might just go to the German and tell them, you know, in this house, they have Jews. So, actually, we were hiding out and nobody was supposed to know that we are Jews, except for the person with whom we lived, he knew that we were Jewish. So, that\u2019s how it worked."

Well, you know, in those years, 1n my -- my times -- you\u2019re talking 55 years ago, there was no such thing as Civil Rights, there wa-was only such a thing as good people versing not such good people. And he was one of those top people, who -- all he knew was perhaps for -- because of his belief, that God said, you know, you should help others and that\u2019s what he was doing.

That reminds me, after the liberation, when we came back to Proscurov, to our home, every night for a whole year, until \u201845, the German planes, 30 or 40 of them would come over every night and bombard the city. And so, we would hear that noise, f- from those planes approaching us and then, of course, either we -- if we had enough time, we would run to shelters and if we didn\u2019t, we would just lie on the floors and -- and our ho -- our glass, you know the windows would be open and we would have tapes on them, that th-the -- the glass should not shatter and we would lie under our beds until they finished bombarding and they left.

            "answer": "I was, at that time, eight. Eight years old, that was in 1944. And, actually the Russians liberated us, okay, the Russian army. And there was -- it was really horrible, because for a day and night, there was door to door fighting between the Russian soldiers and -- and the Germans. And, course the following day, when -- when we realized that we were free, that -- I ran into the house -- to that -- to our room, where that lady with her daughter were and these poor people, you know, their fingers were all frostbitten and well, while they were there, I used to go in the fields and look for a special leaf. There was a special leaf which, when you would put to the infected area, that at least alleviated their pain. Cause, you see, we could not get to a doctor and we were not allowed to go to a hospital and nobody was supposed to know that we were Jews. So, we couldn\u2019t call for help to help that mother and daughter who were constantly in excruciating pain because those -- that area where the fingers fell off, was just closing and half -- it wasn\u2019t completely closed. So -- So I was told that if I can find those type of leaves in the fields, then they would put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would alleviate their pain. So, I used to do that. But then, when we were told that we are liberated, we are free, we don\u2019t have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the street and I ran in to give them the good news. And I was so happy, I was jumping and this poor lady, now I understand, you know, how she felt. Then, I couldn\u2019t understand. She took a broom and she started hitting me. And she said to me, \u201cWhat is there to rejoice?\u201d Because she and her daughter, they were really cripples. And -- And I was jumping for joy, so she beat me up with a broom. And she said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing to rejoice about.\u201d I says, \u201cBut we don\u2019t have -- the Germans are gone, the Germans are gone.\u201d She said, \u201cOh. So?\u201d And that was that, you know, and I just walked out of the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection house, because I was afraid she will beat me up some more, so that was that. Then, we also ran to see the first Russian airplane that landed in that -- 1n our little town. And it was on the hill and it was very big and I was so happy to see this big plane, because when I was little and I would go with my father for walks and I would see an airplane in the sky and I would say, \u201cPapa, how does this plane fly?\u201d And he would say, \u201cThere is a man in it.\u201d And I would say, \u201cBut it\u2019s so small, how can a person sit in it?\u201d And he would say to me, \u201cIt seems to you that it -- he\u2019s -- this plane is very small. That\u2019s because this plane is so far, far away. But it\u2019s really very, very big.\u201d Well, this was my opportunity to see this big plane on the hill -- course with the -- with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh, ar- that was a sunny day and oh, I was so happy. And then, we heard that this was the day that the Germans were planning to kill that handful of Jews that were hiding out with the Gentile people. They had already dug up a ditch for us. But the Russians came in and never gave them a chance to kill us. So, 1-1-1t was a tremendous celebration. I remember we were just dancing in the street and was just something so very special."

So, I -- I -- I just wou -- don\u2019t know exactly how my mother got the money. I think what my mother did is whatever we had, like even the sheets she sold, like if you had them -- we had a sheet and maybe a pillowcase and maybe a blanket. She must have sold it to the people there and that\u2019s how she got money for us to take a train and go back home. And so, it\u2019s a few -- was a few weeks later that we went home to Proscurov.

            "answer": "Always remembered clearly. In fact, whenever I talk about my experience, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s right here. It\u2019s like \u2019'm watching a movie. Right in front of me, there\u2019s a screen and I'll see it all over again. See, I can tell you how the sky was. When it was shining, when it wasn\u2019t. When it was raining. When we were walking -- the first pogrom when they lined us up and we were walking towards the outside of the city to the slaughterhouse. It was cloudy, it was drizzling, it was dreary, it was cold and yet, the liberation, it was sunny, the sun was shining, the sky was blue. I can remember everything.

Like, Pll walk in the street and I'll see -- I'll -- Pll hear a German Shepherd and that\u2019s -- right away, I got back to what has happened to me during those years with the German Shepherds. When I pass a house that has a -- that looks like -- a little like a barn o-or has a barn in back o-of, that brings back memories again. So, every movement in my life and everywhere I go, I see my past. I see a cat, brings back memories. Even -- That\u2019s just unbelievable, but even, you know, the Germans, the SS, their hats. They had these caps with like a brim up front, but up front was very high and then they had insignia, the insignia. Sometimes I\u20191l see someone with a hat similar to that and it like takes me aback. Right away, I'll look at that.

Then in Poland we stayed maybe a day or a day and a half, right. And then from -- from Poland, we had to cross a border to Germany. Now, it is illegal, in those days, it was illegal to cross the borders, unless you had, of course, all the right papers, or whatever. Well -- And, of course, you cannot be Jewish, either. And that\u2019s already, even after the war. But, what my mother did is -- there were always people who for money would smuggle you, okay?

So, this was -- the arrangement was a --a military truck, who was not -- who was -- did not belong to the military any longer, it belonged to those group of men, two or three of them, who would smuggle people for X amount of money. And so, you know, you had to pay for each head, whatever it was and I remember so distinctly, this was this -- you know, th-those military trucks that have canvas on top? You know, those canvas trucks, right? And we must have been maybe 25 - 30 people, with little children, okay? Some were sitting on the side, you know, the benches on the side.

So, as they started walking to the back, to open up the canvas and see what material they were carrying, our driver took off. And they started shooting at us. And he was zigzagging and we were not hit. Were we lucky? I\u2019m lucky all the time. And we made it to Germany, okay? Now, we arrived in Germany, it was dark. And there was a -- see, once you\u2019re in Germany, they knew that these Jews were displaced persons. So they -- no problem, they would just -- you know, ha -- we had to fill out papers, they would register us, who we are, blah, blah, blah and they would -- and -- an-and they was send us to Berlin. Berlin was like the headquarters for all the Jews that were coming from all over the world and from -- from Berlin, they would send us to different displaced person camps -- DP camps they were called. So, all over Germany, they had these DP camps, okay? Our camp was in Bavaria, part of Bavaria. And -- And the city -- the name of the city was Poking, but our camp was outside of Poking, our DP camp, which wa -- there were like -- there were wooden barracks and I don\u2019t know if these barracks were built after the war or they were there before the war, I really don\u2019t know.

I was allowed to work 20 hours a week, so I always had, you know, a few dollars of my own. And I -- I-I met, in my class, my classmate. We became very good Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection friends, with this young lady, her name was Sivia and she lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and she would occasionally invite me to her house for, you know, for the weekend. And then one day she said to me, \u201cYou know, I know s -- a very nice fellow I would like you to meet.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh Sivia, I have so many blind dates. I really don\u2019t want to meet any more.\u201d And she said to me, \u201cBut he\u2019s very nice, and I do want you to meet him. So, let me give him your telephone number and I\u2019Il never bother you again.\u201d Well, she gave Harry, my husband my telephone number, and he called me. So, we made a date, the day my brother was getting married. So he should come to the wedding and pick me up. And that\u2019s what he did. And so, we met. And we went out and I guess there was something that we developed in common. And then, after, you know, dating him for about five months -- from January, February, March, April, May, June, five months and he never said anything. So, I said to myself, \u201cOkay, Pll make him talk.\u201d I can\u2019t go on, you know, I just come out and ask him, \u201cWell, are we serious? I-Is -- I mean, are you interested in me or what?\u201d So, I said to myself, \u201cOkay, that gives me a chance to go back to visit my mother.\u201d Okay? And that wa -- no, the ma -- ma -- I\u2019m sorry, my mother was here, the rest of the family, right. I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to go to Cuba.\u201d And that\u2019s what I did. So, we were dating for f-five months, he said nothing, so I told him, \u201cI\u2019m going back to Cuba and -- and I\u2019Il decide if I\u2019m -- you know, I'll think about if I\u2019m coming back or not coming back, I\u2019m --\u201d this, that. So, I went back to Cuba and he started writing letters. Every day I would get a letter from him and telephone calls and this and that and this and that. And then, in the meantime, I -- I was teaching in the -- in the Hebrew school in Cuba, Judaism. And Labor day, my husband surprised me and came to visit me, to Cuba, and -- you know, in those days we had no jets. I-It -- He had to fly four and a half hours -- five hours to get to Cuba from the u -- from New York. But he came and he met the rest of the family."

Also, the first pogrom, when we ran away, we met in his house, you know, we are supposed to an-and we did, we met in his house an-and he let us stay overnight in his cellar and I remember the rats were running all over us, but we stayed at night there. Now, when we came back -- after liberation we came back home, we were notified by his wife that the Russian government wants to put him in jail because he was -- he was an informant and -- yeah, he was an informant and we don\u2019t really know what happened, what he did, because we were in Romania, right?

It\u2019s like -- 1-1t\u2019s in front of you all the time, because when I talk about it, I relive those days, that time, you know. So it\u2019s like -- Well, actually, I live with it every day, even if I don\u2019t talk about it. As I walk the streets, if I hear a German Shepherd bark, right away it goes back to what happened to me in the past. Something very funny, if I see a-an army officer or someone who wears, you know, the hats that -- that the officer wear, and it\u2019s high up front, they remind me very much of the Gestapo hats, and this upsets me. Then, since we live not too far from the airport -- I told you that last time, many times, I don\u2019t know what, but suddenly there\u2019s that noise, and that noise reminds me, after the war, for about one year, maybe a little longer, the Germans used to come in like 30 - 40 planes, to bomb the city where I lived. And so, as they were coming, there was the tremendous noise. And at the airport here, I can hear it too, and I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t understand why this -- you know, why this noise comes from the airport. And I get very upset, because I open the door and I will look up to the sky, like thinking that a plane\u2019s coming in to bomb the city, God forbid. Oh my God, that\u2019s terrible."

            "answer": "No. We were never able to talk about the Holocaust. She would talk about it, and you know, not much. It -- I think what happened is, remember I mentioned to you that when we came to Cuba, after -- after the war, after we left Germany, and we went to Cuba because my mother had one of her sisters living there. Actually, we were supposed to come into the United States, but because there was a delay and my mother somewheres heard that there\u2019s going to be a World War Three, and she became panicky, she wanted to get out of Europe. So she wrote to her sister and her sister quickly made out the papers, and we came to Cuba. When we came to Cuba, my aunts from the United States, also came to Cuba, to greet 1s when we arrived, which was wonderful, and was a beautiful, sunny day. It really was gorgeous. And my mother wanted to tell them about our experience, about her experience and -- and everything that we went through, and all they said is, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s finished with, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s passe. Now you\u2019re in a free country, you\u2019re with your family, you have nothing to fear, and we don\u2019t tal -- you don\u2019t tal -- you don\u2019t -- you shouldn\u2019t be talking about it because there\u2019s nothing to talk about, finished.\u201d So, I guess, after that, she was sort of, you know, she wouldn\u2019t talk about it much. But occasionally, I would hear her say, remember, you know, \u201cRemember Frima, remember?\u201d I do. I do remember very much. So we never really sat and spoke about it. It\u2019s like she remembered her life and I remembered my life. And -- A-And -- And also, I remember distinctly that -- 1-in those days -- I mean, you\u2019re talking about what, 40 years ago, or 50 years ago? It was something that if we did -- if she said, \u201cRemember this?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d I would start crying right away. So, it was something that you just couldn\u2019t talk about it. Besides, it was always in my mind you\u2019re not supposed to talk about it, because it\u2019s already past. So, we didn\u2019t really discuss it, we didn\u2019t really talk about it."

I mean, we lost a big family, including my father, a grandmother, a -- aunts, uncles, cousins.

            "answer": "That -- Well, 1-1t, you know, everything is possible. I never really asked them why, you know.

It\u2019s just like I was afraid to tell my children when they were little, because I didn\u2019t want them to think that this is what\u2019s going to happen to them. So, I didn\u2019t tell my children anything. I-In fact, my kids, you know, when you\u2019re used to -- to a mother with an accent, they just thought, you know, this is -- it\u2019s normal, and -- and then, you know, later on in life, when they did hear about the Holocaust, and every so often I would tell them a little bit, because I felt that when they were teenagers already, they wouldn\u2019t be so afraid.

The Holocaust -- The Hitler times were completely different from any times in history. And what he did to a nation, the Jewish nation, is beyond explanation, beyond comprehension, beyond understanding.

Different nationalities. So -- And the world let him do it. Everyone just sat back and, well it\u2019s not our business, right?

            "answer": "Well, simply because I think that children will be able to learn an awful lot from my experience. Since I was such a little girl and I had a -- I think it was quite an imagination, to be able to survive, alone, without a mother, without any family, thinking and always being a step ahead of my enemy. That, I think, would give the children who will get to read the book, you know, the strength, perhaps intelligence too, that hopefully they are never in trouble, but if they are, they can think that they can do certain things to survive, and not panic and think, well, you know, there\u2019s nothing they can do. Yes, they can do, because if they learn, a -- they can remember. And by remembering, you -- you know, you react differently. Like when you don\u2019t know anything, you don\u2019t know. Today I look at -- at children five years old, or five and a half, or six, and I say to myself, \u201cOh my God, at their age, I already was hiding.\u201d I knew that no one is supposed to know that I am a Jew. Yet, I knew, that in order to fool others, they should think that I\u2019m not Jewish, I wore a big cross, okay? I had to hide and I had no place where to sleep, so the lady that throws me out of her house, I sleep under her house. And she doesn\u2019t even know. See how I was thinking to survive, ha -- what to do. That she\u2019s not supposed to know, because if she would know, she would -- certainly wouldn\u2019t let me sleep under her house, because she was afraid. But yet -- But yet, I did it, cause I wanted to live, and I wanted to survive. I also knew that -- you know, that I should never walk on the same street twice. People should not suspect that maybe I\u2019m a Jew. And a Jew 1s being killed, so --"

            "answer": "Well, you know, the clothes that I have -- that I was wearing, wasn\u2019t even mine, because I don\u2019t know if I told you or I told the museum, is this was when we were taken to be killed. And so we were completely undressed, except for the panties -- underwear. But, when we got to the slaughterhouse, where they did the killing, the mass killing, a- and my mother spoke to this SS person, asking him if they kill Ukrainians, too. And she gave him the whole story, that she was on her way with her two girls, to this town, which- which was not too far from where the killing wa -- was going on, to see her husband, who was in jail. And he believed her, and then he put us inside the slaughterhouse, we should wait until he brings in a translator, a Ukrainian translator. And then, after he told the translator to take us back to the city, we needed clothing, we were naked. So, he took my sister, told my sister to go outside, and they had mountains, hills of clothing, from everybody else. And so she picked whatever she thought would fit me, herself and my mother. And so, this is what I was wearing, which was a pair of boots, short boots. And I had knee highs, a little sir -- short skirt, a sweater and a little jacket and a scarf. This was my clothing. And I remained with this clothing until the end of the war, which was from \u201941, that\u2019s right, okay? \u201941, so when we were -- the second time in the ghetto, of course my mother washed it, you know, and cleaned it, okay? But, after I was on my own, the six months, I never took it off. I slept this way, and I wore it during the day, cause I had nothing else to wear. You have -- I had no place to take a shower or a bath. So that\u2019s how it was. Unfortunately, 1f you remember I told you, that although I stayed with the lady for two weeks, I was infested with lice. And that 1s because the only time that I got a bath is when my mother brought me in two weeks before. So that day, sh -- that evening, she gave me a bath. But then, the other two weeks that I stayed with her, she didn\u2019t give me a bath. So, I became infested with lice. And so, when she ask me to leave her house, I walked out, and I went to our friend\u2019s, which we used to visit every so often. We bought our house from them, and I remembered where my mother u -- my mother, my father, when we used to go visiting them, and I would walk the same way, they were on the other end of the city, I -- you know, I don\u2019t remember exactly how long it took me to walk. But I walked, and I -- you know, I -- I went to her and she realized that I was s -- I was infested. So, in the winter -- it was already in the winter was very, very cold, she took me into her barn, undressed me, took my clothes and hung it outside, so everything can sort of freeze. And she shaved my head, and -- and she gave me a bath and she put cream over my head, because I had, you know, rashes. I had blood, abs -- just blood already, dripping down my -- my head, because it was so itchy. And I stayed with her for a week, and then she said I have to go. So, how did I survive? Well, I used to go every so often to our neighbors, Gentile neighbors, cause there were no Jews already, in the city. So I would go to them, and they would give me bread, maybe potato soup, a glass of milk. Sometimes they\u2019Il give me fruits. Now, this kept me going. So, I didn\u2019t go every day to them, you know, I couldn\u2019t be seen going to the same place all the time, because then they\u2019Il be always someone who will detect, and feel, you know, that this must be a Jewish kid. So I -- I -- this was always in my mind, I have to be very, very careful, and I was. So whatever they gave me, I made sure that I just save enough to have until I go again next week, or you know, or two weeks later. So, that\u2019s how | a -- and I -- I -- I always tried to go to different neighbors, and one shouldn\u2019t know if, you know, that I went to this one or that one. That\u2019s how I survived.

They would not ask me to stay with them, because they were also afraid. So, if I came and I just -- could you give me -- you know, could you give me something to eat, do you have something? In fact, if I remember correctly, I don\u2019t remember even walking in into the house, but rather, staying outside in the back and they would bring something out to me. Do you understand? So, 1- 1-1t was -- [ -- I -- I think it was quite frightening for them, you know, worrisome for them to -- to deal with something like this, because you know, they could not completely ignore me, and they could not completely reject that I -- if I\u2019m asking for food, so they gave me the food, which was -- that was very nice. If not for them, where would I be going to eat? I couldn\u2019t go to strangers. But if you -- I don\u2019t know if I mentioned that last time, one day, it\u2019s been awhile and I had no food, and here I\u2019m walking, you know, on one of the avenues, and there\u2019s a restaurant and it has a very big window, a glass window, and people are sitting and eating and I\u2019m so hungry. I -- I imagine -- I -- I -- it must have been I didn\u2019t have enough food, really, left. So I\u2019m standing at that window and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m looking in and I see there\u2019s people sitting, there\u2019s one seat available, by the counter. So, I walked in, and I just went over and I sat down. And I\u2019m sitting down next to a gentleman, a -- I don\u2019t know him. A-And the young lady, the waitress, came over and asked me what I wanted. Well, you know, I always remember that I\u2019m not supposed to eat things that are not kosher. So, I asked her for potato soup. So, potato soup has nothing, it\u2019s just water and potatoes, and carrots maybe, maybe. And so, she was -- she thought that I was together with this man. So, of course, she served me, she brought me th-the -- the potato soup, and I finished eating it, and she came over and she said, \u201cYou -- You\u2019re paying? Are you paying?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d Which I didn\u2019t, because the hundred rubles that my mother left me, I -- I bought myself a cross, so I can fool everyone. So -- And I started crying. So, the gentleman just took the bill from her, and he said nothing. I think he may -- maybe he realized that, you know, or maybe he just thought I was an orphan, or maybe he just thought -- well, he couldn\u2019t even know -- he -- he couldn\u2019t really know that I was Jewish, because I had that big cross, and I made sure that everybody sees it, okay? And then, I don\u2019t look Jewish either. So, he must have thought, you know, this kid is just an orphan from somewheres, whatever, and -- and he just said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d and I was crying, and I just walked out crying. But at least I had the soup, and I had the potato -- I mean, the potato soup, which was -- I don\u2019t know how long it lasted me, but that\u2019s how I managed.
