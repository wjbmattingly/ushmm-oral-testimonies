This is an interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on November 23rd, 1998, in Woodmere, Long Island. This 1s a follow up interview to a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum videotaped interview, conducted with Frima Laub on May seventh, 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape one, side A. This 1s a brief ambiance in the home of Frima Laub. This 1s a few seconds of silence in Frima Laub\u2019s home. There 1s, in the background, all sorts of, I guess wind blowers. They are -- It\u2019s a beautiful fall day and neighbors are taking the opportunity to clean off the leaves. So, we are starting, along with the lawn material, which we will forget about. I wanted to ask you first, Frima, if you could give me your full name as a child and the name of each of your immediate family members and just a little bit about them. Maybe where you all were at first.",

Some were born in Volachisk, some were born in Potvolachisk. But, we moved when I was still a little girl. We moved to Proscurov, which is a larger city."

I must leave with your sister. But,\u201d she said, \u201cin the spring, someone will come to get you and bring you to me, wherever I\u2019m going to be.\u201d A-And as much as I didn\u2019t like the thought that my mother was leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was crying and my excuse was, \u201cMama,\u201d I says, \u201cbut I have a headache.\u201d Cause I felt, maybe if I tell her I have a headache, she will stay. And she said to me, she said, \u201cThe lady will give you an aspirin, and you'll feel better. And here.\u201d She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, \u201cIn case you want to buy yourself something and you need money.\u201d So she gave me the hundred rubles and she kissed me goodbye, she walked out. Now -- She walked out, I -- I guess there was something that I must have understood when she said, \u201cI must go, and I can\u2019t take you along,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it is too cold outside.\u201d\u2019 And -- And 1-in Europe, the winters are extremely cold. You can really freeze. And -- And I had very little clothing, because that clothing wasn\u2019t even mine, it was the clothing that belonged to somebody else from the first pogrom yet. So, I guess, in the way, I understood that it\u2019s cold outside and I might get sick or freeze and my mother said she must leave and I knew one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And she just explained to me again what she said, \u201cI had to leave, 1t was too cold and I was afraid if I take you, you might freeze to death.\u201d\u2019 Cause even the clothe -- my clothing consisted of knee-highs and a pair of short boots.

Mostly, there was a handful of Gentile people with a few homes, and -- a-and farms -- fields, they had a lot of fields. And this handful of Jewish people lived with the Gentile families, like we did. We lived with this Gentile gentleman. We were two families in one of his rooms, because that\u2019s all he had 1s one room. And -- And he slept on top of the brick oven and we had -- yeah, our life wasn\u2019t that simple. There was no bathrooms, either. If you had to go to the bathroom, you had to go out in the fields. Those days, things were not the way they are today. And so there was one bed, on -- on that bed there was a mother and a daughter whose fingers were a bit froze -- yeah, frozen from -- from the cold -- yeah, from the cold weather.

And we had another bed, which was a little bit bigger, because my mother, myself, my sister and then later on, a cousin of ours joined us, too. So we all slept on the same bed and instead of sleeping horizontally, we slept diagonally. And if there wasn\u2019t enough room, so one of us will sleep on the floor. A-And that was o-our quarters. Now, what we did is -- is -- we had no money to pay for our -- our rent. So, we worked for this gentleman.

To me, it was just part of my life. And for that, he would give me a loaf of black bread. So, we didn\u2019t have to pay for the rent and he gave me a loaf of bread and that was a tremendous salary."

And, course the following day, when -- when we realized that we were free, that -- I ran into the house -- to that -- to our room, where that lady with her daughter were and these poor people, you know, their fingers were all frostbitten and well, while they were there, I used to go in the fields and look for a special leaf. There was a special leaf which, when you would put to the infected area, that at least alleviated their pain. Cause, you see, we could not get to a doctor and we were not allowed to go to a hospital and nobody was supposed to know that we were Jews. So, we couldn\u2019t call for help to help that mother and daughter who were constantly in excruciating pain because those -- that area where the fingers fell off, was just closing and half -- it wasn\u2019t completely closed. So -- So I was told that if I can find those type of leaves in the fields, then they would put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would alleviate their pain. So, I used to do that. But then, when we were told that we are liberated, we are free, we don\u2019t have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the street and I ran in to give them the good news. And I was so happy, I was jumping and this poor lady, now I understand, you know, how she felt. Then, I couldn\u2019t understand. She took a broom and she started hitting me.

Then, we also ran to see the first Russian airplane that landed in that -- 1n our little town. And it was on the hill and it was very big and I was so happy to see this big plane, because when I was little and I would go with my father for walks and I would see an airplane in the sky and I would say, \u201cPapa, how does this plane fly?\u201d And he would say, \u201cThere is a man in it.\u201d And I would say, \u201cBut it\u2019s so small, how can a person sit in it?\u201d And he would say to me, \u201cIt seems to you that it -- he\u2019s -- this plane is very small. That\u2019s because this plane is so far, far away. But it\u2019s really very, very big.\u201d Well, this was my opportunity to see this big plane on the hill -- course with the -- with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh, ar- that was a sunny day and oh, I was so happy. And then, we heard that this was the day that the Germans were planning to kill that handful of Jews that were hiding out with the Gentile people. They had already dug up a ditch for us. But the Russians came in and never gave them a chance to kill us. So, 1-1-1t was a tremendous celebration. I remember we were just dancing in the street and was just something so very special."

And then ho -- all -- a-after we were lined up to go, you know, to the slaughterhouse I call it, you know, where they did the killings, on both sides of the roads, on the road that we walked towards the slaughterhouse, they had the SS, with the German Shepherds, standing there.

And during the time that I was alone, and I was walking the streets, I used to hide between the trees at night, when I would go back to the ladies house, to sleep under -- under her house, I would go between the shadows of the trees, I should not be noticed by the German Shepherd. Because, you know, they -- they -- if they see a shadow, they'll -- they\u2019Il run after a shadow. I was ou -- I tried to be so careful. I-It was unbelievable. And their barking just never left me. And the fear of what they can do to you, with their masters, I mean, 1-is something that did not change my feelings and th-this is unfortunate that -- the language -- a-and I would just never go back.

Every night, when I climbed in, you know, in -- one, two o\u2019clock in the morning when I climbed in to my -- my -- my doggy, to sleep with, I would take off my cross and in Hebrew I would say my prayers, those prayers that my mother taught me when I was a little girl."

Since I was such a little girl and I had a -- I think it was quite an imagination, to be able to survive, alone, without a mother, without any family, thinking and always being a step ahead of my enemy. That, I think, would give the children who will get to read the book, you know, the strength, perhaps intelligence too, that hopefully they are never in trouble, but if they are, they can think that they can do certain things to survive, and not panic and think, well, you know, there\u2019s nothing they can do. Yes, they can do, because if they learn, a -- they can remember. And by remembering, you -- you know, you react differently. Like when you don\u2019t know anything, you don\u2019t know. Today I look at -- at children five years old, or five and a half, or six, and I say to myself, \u201cOh my God, at their age, I already was hiding.\u201d I knew that no one is supposed to know that I am a Jew. Yet, I knew, that in order to fool others, they should think that I\u2019m not Jewish, I wore a big cross, okay?

And then, after he told the translator to take us back to the city, we needed clothing, we were naked. So, he took my sister, told my sister to go outside, and they had mountains, hills of clothing, from everybody else. And so she picked whatever she thought would fit me, herself and my mother.

This was my clothing. And I remained with this clothing until the end of the war, which was from \u201941, that\u2019s right, okay? \u201941, so when we were -- the second time in the ghetto, of course my mother washed it, you know, and cleaned it, okay?

Unfortunately, 1f you remember I told you, that although I stayed with the lady for two weeks, I was infested with lice. And that 1s because the only time that I got a bath is when my mother brought me in two weeks before. So that day, sh -- that evening, she gave me a bath. But then, the other two weeks that I stayed with her, she didn\u2019t give me a bath. So, I became infested with lice. And so, when she ask me to leave her house, I walked out, and I went to our friend\u2019s, which we used to visit every so often. We bought our house from them, and I remembered where my mother u -- my mother, my father, when we used to go visiting them, and I would walk the same way, they were on the other end of the city, I -- you know, I don\u2019t remember exactly how long it took me to walk. But I walked, and I -- you know, I -- I went to her and she realized that I was s -- I was infested. So, in the winter -- it was already in the winter was very, very cold, she took me into her barn, undressed me, took my clothes and hung it outside, so everything can sort of freeze. And she shaved my head, and -- and she gave me a bath and she put cream over my head, because I had, you know, rashes. I had blood, abs -- just blood already, dripping down my -- my head, because it was so itchy. And I stayed with her for  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, how did I survive? Well, I used to go every so often to our neighbors, Gentile neighbors, cause there were no Jews already, in the city. So I would go to them, and they would give me bread, maybe potato soup, a glass of milk. Sometimes they\u2019Il give me fruits. Now, this kept me going. So, I didn\u2019t go every day to them, you know, I couldn\u2019t be seen going to the same place all the time, because then they\u2019Il be always someone who will detect, and feel, you know, that this must be a Jewish kid. So I -- I -- this was always in my mind, I have to be very, very careful, and I was. So whatever they gave me, I made sure that I just save enough to have until I go again next week, or you know, or two weeks later. So, that\u2019s how | a -- and I -- I -- I always tried to go to different neighbors, and one shouldn\u2019t know if, you know, that I went to this one or that one. That\u2019s how I survived.

But, if they in -- they are taught since they\u2019re very little, that that -- you know, the hostility towards Israel, so how can they grow up wanting peace? How can there be peace if they hate their next door neighbor? They don\u2019t want to tolerate a next door neighbor.
