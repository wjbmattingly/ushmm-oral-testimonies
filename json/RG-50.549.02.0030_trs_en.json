This is an interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on November 23rd, 1998, in Woodmere, Long Island.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possibl e. This is tape one, side A. This is a brief ambiance in the home of Frima Laub. This is a few seconds of silence in Frima Laub\u2122s home. There is, in the background, all sorts of, I guess wind blowers. They are -- It\u2122s a beautiful fall day and neighbors are taking the opportunity to clean off the leaves. So, we are starting, along with the lawn material, which we will forget about. I wanted to ask you first, Frima, if you could give me your full name as a child and the name of each of your immediate family members and just a little bit about them. Maybe where you all were at first.",

Okay, before the war, we live in a very lovely city, by the name of Volachisk -- I\u2122m sorry, not Volachisk, Proscurov, which is near Volachisk and Potvolachisk, where the rest of my relatives were born. Some were born in Volachisk, some were born in Potvolachisk. But, we moved when I was still a little girl. We moved to Proscurov, which is a larger city."

Did you have any idea of what year it was, or how old you were when you first stayed alone with the Gentile woman?",
            "answer": "Yes, that was in 1942, after the second pogrom in Proscurov. This is where -- My mother felt that she had to leave the city, of course, with my sister -- at that time, we didn\u2122t know where m -- our father was. A nd my brother, of course, we didn\u2122t know where he was, since he was in Kiev, since before the war -- the war started. So, that was after the second pogrom, when my mother felt everybody was killed in the city and she USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 4 had to run away because they were searching for remaining Jews. So, that\u2122s when she left me with that Gentile lady. So, I was six years old, little bit over six, yeah."

            "answer": "It\u2122s such a interesting question. Did I understand? I -- Obviously, I must have understood something when she said, \ufb01You have to stay here. I must leave with your sister. But,\ufb02 she said, \ufb01in the spring, someone will come to get you and bring you to me, wherever I\u2122m going to be.\ufb02 A-And as much as I didn\u2122t like the thought that my mother was leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was crying and my excuse was, \ufb01Mama,\ufb02 I says, \ufb01but I have a headache.\ufb02 Cause I felt, maybe if I tell her I have a headache, she will stay. And she said to me, she said, \ufb01The lady will give you an aspirin, and you\u2122ll feel better. And here.\ufb02 She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, \ufb01In case you want to buy yourself something and you need money.\ufb02 So she gave me the hundred rubles and she kissed me goodbye, she walked out. Now -- She walked out, I -- I guess there was something that I must have understood when she said, \ufb01I must go, and I can\u2122t take you along,\ufb02 she says, \ufb01because it is too cold outside.\ufb02 And -- And i-in Europe, the winters are extremely cold. You can really freeze. And -- And I had very little clothing, because that clothing wasn\u2122t even mine, it was the clothing that belonged to somebody else from the first pogrom yet. So, I guess, in the way, I understood that it\u2122s cold outside and I might get sick or freeze and my mother said she must leave and I knew one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 5 escape. So, that was my understanding, and I di dn\u2122t make a scene. I just said, \ufb01My head hurts.\ufb02 That\u2122s all."

And I just never discussed it with her and I -- but I did asked her, when we were reunited and she held me on her lap -- see, now I remem -- I remember, and my first question was, \ufb01Mama, why did you leave me?\ufb02 Th at I did, yeah. And she just explained to me again what she said, \ufb01I had to leave, it was too cold and I was afraid if I take you, you might freeze to death.\ufb02 Cause even the clothe -- my clothing consisted of knee-highs and a pair of short boots. A little skirt, a sweater and a little jacket with a scarf, that\u2122s it."

            "answer": "W-We lived in this very, very small town, it was occupied Romania and I understand this was still part of the Ukraine, but it was next to Romania and they call it occupied Romania. Mostly, there was a handful of Gentile people with a few homes, and -- a-and farms -- fields, they had a lot of fields. And this handful of Jewish people lived with the Gentile families, like we did. We lived with this Gentile gentleman. We were two families in one of his rooms, because that\u2122s all he had is one room. And -- And he slept on top of the brick oven and we had -- yeah, our life wasn\u2122t that simple. There was no bathrooms, either. If you had to go to the bath room, you had to go out in the fields. Those days, things were not the way they are today. And so there was one bed, on -- on that bed there was a mother and a daughter whose finge rs were a bit froze -- yeah, frozen from -- from the cold -- yeah, from the cold weather. They were trying to hide and wherever they hid, they obviously were not dressed properly."

So, they slept on one -- it wasn\u2122t really a bed, it was one of those four legs and -- a-a-and -- and some hay on it, I mean, that was the bed. And we had another bed, which was a little bit bigger, because my mother, myself, my sister and then later on, a cousin of ours joined us, too. So we all slept on the same bed and instead of sleepi ng horizontally, we slept diagonally. And if there wasn\u2122t enough room, so one of us will sleep on the floor. A-And that was o-our quarters. Now, what we did is -- is -- we had no money to pay for our -- our rent. So, we worked for this gentleman. Of course, we were very grateful, the fact that he even gave USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 7 us a place where to sleep -- where to sleep. So, we worked on his -- on his fields and I was one of his workers, and my job was to -- with my fingers, I would have to dig out the potatoes from -- you know, from under the earth. A nd I cleaned them up, put them in a sack and tied the sack and then, you know, just so -- drag it to his warehouse, which I don\u2122t know how many blocks it was exactly, I neve r counted it. To me, it was just part of my life. And for that, he would give me a loaf of black bread. So, we didn\u2122t have to pay for the rent and he gave me a loaf of bread and that was a tremendous salary."

Or -- Or someone, some other Gentile would know that you were Jewish, he might just go to the German and tell them, you know, in this house, they have Jews. So, actually, we were hiding out and nobody was supposed to know that we are Jews, except for the person with whom we lived, he knew that we were Jewish. So, that\u2122s how it worked."

            "answer": "I was, at that time, eight. Eight years old, that was in 1944. And, actually the Russians liberated us, okay, the Russian army. And there was -- it was really horrible, because for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 11 a day and night, there was door to door fighting between the Russian soldiers and -- and the Germans. And, course the following day, wh en -- when we realized that we were free, that -- I ran into the house -- to that -- to our room, where that lady with her daughter were and these poor people, you know, their fingers were all frostbitten and well, while they were there, I used to go in the fields and look for a special leaf. There was a special leaf which, when you would put to the infected area, that at least alleviated their pain. Cause, you see, we could not get to a doctor and we were not allowed to go to a hospital and nobody was supposed to know that we were Jews. So, we couldn\u2122t call for help to help that mother and daughter who were cons tantly in excruciating pain because those -- that area where the fingers fell off, was just closing and half -- it wasn\u2122t completely closed. So -- So I was told that if I can find those type of leaves in the fields, then they would put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would alleviate their pain. So, I used to do that. But then, when we were told that we are liberated, we are free, we don\u2122t have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the street and I ran in to give them the good news. And I was so happy, I was jumping and this poor lady, now I understand, you know, how she felt. Then, I couldn\u2122t understand. She took a broom and she started hitting me. And she said to me, \ufb01What is there to rejoice?\ufb02 Because she and her daughter, they were really cripples. And -- And I was jumping for joy, so she beat me up with a broom. And she said, \ufb01Well, there\u2122s nothing to rejoice about.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01But we don\u2122t have -- the Germans are gone, the Germans are gone.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Oh. So?\ufb02 And that was that, you know, and I just walked out of the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 12 house, because I was afraid she will beat me up some more, so that was that. Then, we also ran to see the first Russian airplane that landed in that -- in our little town. And it was on the hill and it was very big and I was so happy to see this big plane, because when I was little and I would go with my father for walks and I would see an airplane in the sky and I would say, \ufb01Papa, how does this plane fly?\ufb02 And he would say, \ufb01There is a man in it.\ufb02 And I would say, \ufb01But it\u2122s so small, how can a person sit in it?\ufb02 And he would say to me, \ufb01It seems to you that it -- he\u2122s -- this pl ane is very small. That\u2122s because this plane is so far, far away. But it\u2122s really very, very big.\ufb02 Well, this was my opportunity to see this big plane on the hill -- course with the -- with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh, ar -- that was a sunny day and oh, I was so happy. And then, we heard that this was the day that the Germans were planning to kill that handful of Jews that were hiding out with the Gentile people. They had already dug up a ditch for us. But the Russians came in and never gave them a chance to kill us. So, i-i-it was a tremendous celebration. I remember we were just dancing in the street and was just something so very special."

They had these caps with like a brim up front, but up front was very high and then they had insignia, the insignia. Sometimes I\u2122ll see someone with a hat similar to that and it like takes me aback. Right away, I\u2122ll look at that.

And we went out and I guess there was something that we developed in comm on. And then, after, you know, dating him for about five months -- from January, February, March, April, May, June, five months and he never said anything. So, I said to mysel f, \ufb01Okay, I\u2122ll make him talk.\ufb02 I can\u2122t go on, you know, I just come out and ask him, \ufb01Well, are we serious? I-Is -- I mean, are you interested in me or what?\ufb02 So, I said to myself, \ufb01Okay, that gives me a chance to go back to visit my mother.\ufb02 Okay? And that wa -- no, the ma -- ma -- I\u2122m sorry, my mother was here, the rest of the family, right. I said, \ufb01Okay, I\u2122m going to go to Cuba.\ufb02 And that\u2122s what I did.

Also, the first pogrom, when we ran away, we met in his house, you know, we are supposed to an-and we did, we met in his hous e an-and he let us stay overnight in his cellar and I remember the rats were running a ll over us, but we stayed at night there. Now, when we came back -- after liberation we came back home, we were notified by his wife that the Russian government wants to put him in jail because he was -- he was an informant and -- yeah, he was an informan t and we don\u2122t really know what happened, what he did, because we were in Romania, right?

My mother took me to court and I remember it was a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 68 round room.

And so we were completely undressed, except for the panties -- underwear. But, when we got to the slaughterhouse, where they did the killing, the mass killing, a-and my mother spoke to this SS person, asking him if they kill Ukrainians, too. And she gave him the whole story, that she was on her way with her two girls, to this town, which -- which was not too far from where the killing wa -- was going on, to see her husband, who was in jail. And he believed her, and then he put us inside the slaughterhouse, we should wait until he brings in a translator, a Ukrainian translator. And then, after he told the translator to take us back to the city, we needed clothing, we were naked. So, he took my sister, told my sister to go outside, and they had mountains, hills of clothing, from everybody else. And so she picked whatever she thought would fit me, herself and my mother. And so, this is what I was wearing, which was a pair of boots, short boots. And I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 84 had knee highs, a little sir -- short skirt, a sweater and a little jacket and a scarf. This was my clothing. And I remained with this clothing until the end of the war, which was from \u212241, that\u2122s right, okay? \u212241, so when we were -- the second time in the ghetto, of course my mother washed it, you know, and cleaned it, okay? But, after I was on my own, the six months, I never took it off. I slept this way, and I wore it during the day, cause I had nothing else to wear. You have -- I had no place to take a shower or a bath. So that\u2122s how it was. Unfortunately, if you remember I told you, that although I stayed with the lady for two weeks, I was infested with lice. And that is because the only time that I got a bath is when my mother brought me in two weeks befo re. So that day, sh -- that evening, she gave me a bath. But then, the other two weeks that I stayed with her, she didn\u2122t give me a bath. So, I became infested with lice. And so, when she ask me to leave her house, I walked out, and I went to our friend\u2122s, which we used to visit every so often. We bought our house from them, and I remembered where my mother u -- my mother, my father, when we used to go visiting them, and I w ould walk the same way, they were on the other end of the city, I -- you know, I don\u2122t remember exactly how long it took me to walk. But I walked, and I -- you know, I -- I went to her and she realized that I was s -- I was infested. So, in the winter -- it was already in the winter was very, very cold, she took me into her barn, undressed me, took my clothes and hung it outside, so everything can sort of freeze. And she shaved my head, and -- and she gave me a bath and she put cream over my head, because I had, you know, rashes. I had blood, abs -- just blood already, dripping down my -- my head, because it was so itchy. And I stayed with her for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 85 a week, and then she said I have to go. So, how did I survive? Well, I used to go every so often to our neighbors, Gentile neighbors, cause there were no Jews already, in the city. So I would go to them, and they would give me bread, maybe potato soup, a glass of milk. Sometimes they\u2122ll give me fruits. Now, this kept me going. So, I didn\u2122t go every day to them, you know, I couldn\u2122t be seen going to the same place all the time, because then they\u2122ll be always someone who will detect, and feel, you know, that this must be a Jewish kid. So I -- I -- this was always in my mind, I have to be very, very careful, and I was. So whatever they gave me, I made sure that I just save enough to have until I go again next week, or you know, or two weeks later. So, that\u2122s how I a -- and I -- I -- I always tried to go to different neighbors, and one shouldn\u2122t know if, you know, that I went to this one or that one. That\u2122s how I survived.

In fact, if I remember correctly, I don\u2122t remember even walk ing in into the house, but rather, staying outside in the back and they would bring something out to me. Do you understand? So, i USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 86 i-it was -- I -- I -- I think it was quite frightening for them, you know, worrisome for them to -- to deal with someth ing like this, because you know, they could not completely ignore me, and they could not completely reject that I -- if I\u2122m asking for food, so they gave me the food, which was -- that was very nice. If not for them, where would I be going to eat? I couldn\u2122t go to strangers. But if you -- I don\u2122t know if I mentioned that last time, one day, it\u2122s been awhile and I ha d no food, and here I\u2122m walking, you know, on one of the avenues, and there\u2122s a restaurant and it has a very big window, a glass window, and people are sitting and eating and I\u2122m so hungry. I -- I imagine -- I -- I -- it must have been I didn\u2122t have enough food, re ally, left. So I\u2122m standing at that window and I\u2122m -- I\u2122m looking in and I see there\u2122s people sitting, there\u2122s one seat available, by the counter. So, I walked in, and I just went over and I sat down. And I\u2122m sitting down next to a gentleman, a -- I don\u2122t know him. A-And the young lady, the waitress, came over and asked me what I wanted. Well, you know, I always remember that I\u2122m not supposed to eat things that are not kosher. So, I asked her for potato soup. So, potato soup has nothing, it\u2122s just water and potatoes, and carrots maybe, maybe. And so, she was -- she thought that I was together with this man. So, of course, she served me, she brought me th-the -- the potato soup, and I fi nished eating it, and she came over and she said, \ufb01You -- You\u2122re paying? Are you paying?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t have any money.\ufb02 Which I didn\u2122t, because the hundred rubles that my mother left me, I -- I bought myself a cross, so I can fool everyone. So -- And I started crying. So, the gentleman just took the bill from her, and he said nothing. I think he may -- maybe he realized that, you know, or USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 87 maybe he just thought I was an orphan, or maybe he just thought -- well, he couldn\u2122t even know -- he -- he couldn\u2122t really know that I was Jewish, because I had that big cross, and I made sure that everybody sees it, okay? And then, I don\u2122t look Jewish either. So, he must have thought, you know, this ki d is just an orphan from somewheres, whatever, and -- and he just said, \ufb01It\u2122s okay, it\u2122s okay,\ufb02 and I was crying, and I just walked out crying. But at least I had the soup, and I had the potato -- I mean, the potato soup, which was -- I don\u2122t know how long it lasted me, but that\u2122s how I managed.

You know, we were hiding from the Germans. And then, you know what happened. This neighbor of ours would bring us, once a day she would bring us food. And then one day somebody must have seen her do it, and they called the -- the SS, and they followed her while she was walking, bringing us food, and she started yelling to us, \ufb01Save yourselves, save yourselves,\ufb02 and we were, you know, o -- i-in -- in the attic of the barn, and so my mother and sister, in the back, you know, everything is wooden, you know, panels, broke two wooden panels, and we jumped like two stories down and we ran and we escaped.

And -- And we started building and building from nothing, from ashes. So, I wish that other people, you know, who are really USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 141 down, and -- and -- and don\u2122t have much, they should look to -- look up to the survivors and say, look at them. They came from -- from -- really from hell, and look at them. They have a home, they make sure the children go for an education. They -- They live nicely, you know? They -- Their lives are -- I mean, not all are millionaires, but most of them accomplished something. And the accomplishment is, they don\u2122t -- they -- they don\u2122t have to beg, because they all make a living somehow. And their children are all educated. In fact, I got to tell you this, when I lived in Brooklyn, there were 13 religious families, that\u2122s it. I mean, in that area, 13 religious families, Holocaust survivors, all of us, all 13 families. Now, out of these 13 Holocaust survivor\u2122s families, many of us never went to school. Of course, I went to school, cause I was the -- you know, I was a baby when I -- when I -- when World War Two started. But, they were already older, so when they came to the United States, they didn\u2122t have the time to go to school. They had to make a living, they had to survive here. But out of these 13 Holocaust surviving families, we gave to the world, nine doctors. Nine doctors, that\u2122s without counting lawyers, accountant, engineer, dentist. Nine doctors. That means some of the families had two doctors in the families."
