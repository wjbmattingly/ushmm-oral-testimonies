So, she said, go there, and I'll bring you tomorrow some food. So I went there. She knew \u2014 she pointed where the part is, and you know, there were corn that were camouflaging me, and there was a \u2014 a little di \u2014 ditch \u2014 ditch, you call it a ditch. So I lied in that ditch, and I was saying the Sh\u2019ma, because I knew the meaning of the Sh\u2019ma. I have it in the book in English, a few words, hear oh God.

So I ate this, and then the other day, I figured, I must go to the pump. We didn't have like a \u2014 to get water, or \u2014 closer. So, I had to cross a street, and cross a few houses \u2014 I mean, pass by a few houses and get a drink of water. So I\u2014 I went there \u2014 I mean, I was going to cross the street to get from the pump some water. So of course, I couldn\u2019t because one of the people that I walked by, one of the neighbors, I said, can I get a f \u2014 a little bit of water from you? And so she sends a policeman to \u2014 she said, oh, a Jewish girl just went. So I ran back to that ditch, and he was yelling, we\u2019ll kill you anyway, we'll find you. So \u2014 we know, she said in a \u2014 in a navy blue coat. So I threw out the coat, because I heard her. Wasn\u2019t a long coat, a short coat. And I put \u2014 run into that ditch. So they started shooting, they didn't \u2014 there was corn, high corn, they didn\u2019t see the ditch.

So I said, well, it\u2019s after the action, they called it an action. Ill go to my neighbors\u2019 house, who were Christians, and they were nice people, I said, and they will help me out to get to the ghetto and see if my father is alive. Because I still felt, why survive, Ill be killed anyway, you know, even though at 16, I felt this way because I was suffering my little girls \u2014 little girls, my little sister, the other sister, they were questioning it and they got killed. So what am I so special, you know? So then they \u2014 that was Sunday morning, and I said th \u2014 to the teacher, to Pani Fiedrowiczowa, | said, I\u2019m going to go to that neighbor. I\u2019m a little repetitious, but forgive me because I can\u2019t think straight when I think about it. So she said, no, you can\u2019t go. I said, why not? So, she said, it\u2019s Sunday, you\u2019re not dressed right, you cannot go to your neighbor. You\u2019ll go tomorrow, Monday. So I figured, she means well. So, of course I didn\u2019t go. And Monday morning she brought me eggs, and \u2014 and water to drink, and she was very, very nice. So Monday morning, I went to my neighbor. And my neighbor was next to my uncle\u2019s house, you know. My uncle got killed, they all got killed. So I said to her \u2014 I knew that he \u2014 she has \u2014 they were villagers, but they were police, that she\u2019s not gonna send me a policeman that\u2019 11 take me to the Germans.

But the police said \u2014 two policemen she has ha \u2014 she had, from the village, said to me, well, you\u2019re alone? I said no, I have my father. I didn\u2019t know if he survived.
