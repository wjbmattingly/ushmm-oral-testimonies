She knew \u0152 she pointed where the part is, and you know, there were corn that were camouflaging me, and there was a \u0152 a little di \u0152 ditch \u0152 ditch, you call it a ditch.

So I ate this, and then the other day, I figured, I must go to the pu mp. We didn't have like a \u0152 to get water, or \u0152 closer. So, I had to cross a street , and cross a few houses \u0152 I mean, pass by a few houses and get a drink of water. So I \u0152 I went there \u0152 I mean, I was going to cross the street to get from the pump some water. So of course, I couldn\u2122t because one of the people that I walked by, one of the neighbors, I said, can I get a f \u0152 a little bit of water from you? And so she sends a pol iceman to \u0152 she said, oh, a Jewish girl just went. So I ran back to that ditch, and he was yelling, we\u2122ll kill you anyway, we\u2122ll find you. So \u0152 we know, she said in a \u0152 in a navy blue coat. So I threw out the coat, because I heard her. Wasn\u2122t a long coat , a short coat. And I put \u0152 run into that ditch. So they started shooting, they didn't \u0152 there was corn, high corn, they didn\u2122t see the ditch. So I survived that night, and then I went the next morning \u0152 no, I didn\u2122t go to the pump the next morning, because I knew that she is gonna \u0152 but again, I figured, I have to take a drink of water before I get killed. The idea was to go. I get up and I see my teacher cutting the corn, Fiedrowiczowa, I remember her name. So, I said, Pani Fiedrowiczowa, in Polish. I am very thirsty. Can you bring me some water? Oh, I\u2122ll bring you some wa ter. Don\u2122t go too far. Bring me \u0152 so she Interview with Esia Shor February 22, 2010 23brought me some water. And the next \u0152 so I drank, drank the water. And then the next day was Sunday. This was Friday \u0152 I mean Saturday, and the next day was Sunday. So I said, well, it\u2122s after the action, they called it an action. I\u2122ll go to my neighbors\u2122 house, who were Christians, and they were nice people, I said, and they will help me out to get to the ghetto and see if my father is alive. Because I still felt, why survive, I\u2122ll be killed anyway, you kno w, even though at 16, I felt this way because I was suffering my little girls \u0152 little girls, my little sister, the other sister, they were questioning it and they got killed. So what am I so special, you know? So then they \u0152 that was Sunday morning, and I said th \u0152 to the teacher, to Pani Fiedrowiczowa, I said, I\u2122m going to go to that neighbor. I\u2122m a little repetitious, but forgive me because I can\u2122t think straight when I think about it. So she said, no, you can\u2122t go. I said, why not? So, she said, it\u2122s Sunday, you\u2122re not dressed right, you cannot go to your neighbor. You\u2122ll go tomo rrow, Monday. So I figured, she means well. So, of course I didn\u2122t go. And Mond ay morning she brought me eggs, and \u0152 and water to drink, and she was very, very nice. So Monday morning, I went to my neighbor. And my neighbor was next to my uncle\u2122s house, you know. My uncle got killed, they all got killed. So I said to her \u0152 I knew that he \u0152 she has \u0152 they were villagers, but they were police, that she\u2122s not gonna send me a policeman that\u2122ll take me to the Germans. I somehow have the confidence in her as a neighbor. And Interview with Esia Shor February 22, 2010 24sure enough, the confidence was right. But the police said \u0152 two policemen she has ha \u0152 she had, from the village, said to me, well, you\u2122re alone? I said no, I have my father. I didn\u2122t know if he survived. We need 200 rubles for this, to take me to the ghetto, because in a way, they are taking a chance. So yeah, my father\u2122s alive, he\u2122ll gi-give you the money. My fa ther didn\u2122t have any money, but they took me to the ghetto through the entrance, and they said that the Germans said that they should take me to the ghetto, I still can work and so on.
