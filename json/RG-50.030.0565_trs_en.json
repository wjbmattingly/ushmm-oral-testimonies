Nobody would say a word. But, you know, I \u2014 I was challenged by them, that Jews don\u2019t fight, and Jewish girls specially don\u2019t fight. So that\u2019s why I went. Why would I go with them? And I wanted to do something in revenge, what they did to my family and the rest of the Jews. So this was my experience with a \u2014 forgot, they were [indecipherable] I think. And then the man survived, that I took care of him."
