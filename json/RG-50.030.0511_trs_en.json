Maybe seven, eight -- six, seven, eight years old, I don\u2019t know for sure, he got sick and tired of traveling with those big sample cases, so he hired -- he bought a car and he hired a chauffeur, because he was not very adept at driving.

So to break in to the -- like what they call [indecipherable] which is the wurst, sausage business and ja -- ham and things like that, it\u2019s not the easiest, so you have to really make a good product. But the Germans are fabulous when it comes to sausages and such. So the boys were good, they made inroads, slowly. The only thing wrong about the whole situation was there were young boys.

So the boys discovered the races, they discovered the women, and they discovered gambling. Now, they were drawing a fairly decent salary, but that wasn\u2019t enough for the lifestyle. So what they did, unbeknownst to my father, obviously, they looked at the delivery schedule for the -- today. So they filled the truck with all the stuff, and before the regular delivery boys could start, they went to the customers and sold the stuff at a little discount. So when the regular discount -- ah, the regular driver came along, sorry, you delivered this morning. So before my father found out, it was a little late. The business was shut there. So who was stuck with everything? My father had to pay off the machinery, had to pay off the trucks, have to pay off everything. So whatever money you have goes down the sewer. And the guys, couple of them, disappeared to the hospitality of countries such as Argentina.

Now when I say barracks, which goes for any time that I mention a barrack, this is something like a wa -- one inch thick, you know, which 1s like three-quarters thick woods, and one layer, and covered with black tar paper, which is wonderful in the summertime, because the black reverberates the sun, and takes it in.

So, had maybe 20 barracks per, and they had letters, A, B, C, D, you know, and so on, so forth. So I -- I believe my memory serves, I went in number H. Of course, the only trouble was that the barracks were of the same construction, even though we\u2019re facing winter now. Same thing, black tar, once inch ply -- one inch wood. Now the only thing is, no Senegalese left their deposits there. This was okay because who was there before us were the Spanish refugees. And a few Spanish refugees were still left there to do maintenance work, the nicest young men you ever met in your life. Friendly, gregarious, helpful, God knows what.

From the s -- the back is covered, the front 1s open, and there\u2019s a walkway, and then you -- whatever one of the latrines, there might be 10 spots per, maybe more, I don\u2019t know. I doubt -- I didn't make a business of committing that to memory, it wasn't that pleasant. They weren't close by. Why was that bad? In San Cyprian they were God knows how far away on the -- on the border of the ocean. Over here, it started to rain and the soil, which was clay, turned to mud. Now we had to be very careful because you sank in up to here, because the mud has a tendency to suck your shoes right off your feet. I got pictures to prove all that, too. This is not something that I make up. So it was quite unpleasant. So sometimes -- they had made a little walkway, you know, threw some pieces of wood over there on some runners, you know? So that was already pretty good, but that wasn\u2019t all over, you know? So anyway, the food was horrible, and they didn\u2019t mistreat us. We never had to wor -- look, we were so damn weak, my stomach growling all the time, I was hungry all the time. Whenever I say hungry, I mean not hey, I would like to eat some, I mean hungry that you were starving, okay? And the stomach is growling, there\u2019s nothing in there.

So they shipped them over to the United States, and the United States said the same thing, so what was left over, they send them right back to Germany, and the Germans said, you see, I told you nobody wants the Jews. So we happened to wind up with survivors from the Saint Louis. Now these were all top of the line people. I mean, we\u2019re talking the intelligentsia, you know? Lawyers, writers, movie producers, and whatnot. And they showed the stress of the trip there. I remember one movie producer, must have been in his heydays maybe 250 pounds. Well, the reason I can say that 1s because first of all, those barracks didn\u2019t have any yo -- windows. A door at one each -- a door at each end. And we had one bulb hanging from the ceiling in the middle, which went on for one hour at night, if it\u2019s a lot, okay? And so we -- at night we stripped to look for lice -- you know, lice? And tried to kill whatever you could find in your clothing. So I saw him stripped one day, and whatever his stomach was, was now a big flap hanging there. So I know the situation well -- too good.

So the guy was one of the Spanish Civil War refugees, and he had the [indecipherable]. Very nice fellow, but he got a little greedy. He got into problems, so they dumped him. And I heard about that, I says, that\u2019s my job. So I went and [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t speak French as perfectly as I did. I went there, I impressed them no a -- no end, you know. Was him and the -- his assistant. I was hired on the spot. So now I\u2019m living in splendor. There is -- you -- look at the barrack, the -- they have the same barrack. The only difference is, picture a railroad car, and offices to either side with doors. And he has the whole back end of the barrack, the director, right? He lived on camp, as it would be, or on campus, what -- however you want to put it. He had a beautiful house a little away from everything else, big villa, you know, with his wife, two kids. And so we had also what you would call a reception room. The reception room had a little window, people ask questions, then the door, and then part of the reception room was partitioned off about -- I\u2019d say about three feet. A wall, with a curtain. There was a bed in there. Luxury unlimited as far as I\u2019m concerned. I didn\u2019t have a bed before. Like a regular cot, you know? And I -- whatever I had, th-th-the three pieces of clothing I could hang up, whatever. Was three feet by maybe eight feet. Luxury unlimited, and it was separated from the reception area. And I dealt with the inspectors, I dealt with the radio operator, I dealt with the boss, I del -- I dealt with his assistant. So they made me do jobs, you know, like little jobs and things like that. But it paid off in the end, I tell you, big time. So the most amazing thing 1s that -- of course there was no gasoline to be had in France, so the French invented cars that -- the regular cars were converted to run on charcoal gas. They had those big cylinders mounted in the back of their car, and you threw charcoal in there and you lit it and that created gas and that went through a tubing to some sort of fuel indi -- gas injector. And you weren't ri -- winning any races with it, but you could at least do 25 miles an hour with that, flat of course, you know. So th-the -- th-the Germans were even smarter than that, they invent -- they were so -- so brilliant, they invented something, they had two cylinders on the trucks, one on this side, one on that side. And then they had bags of chopped green wood, mind you. You took a bag of green wood, threw it in that cylinder, that transform it into charcoal, send it over to that cylinder, and that\u2019s how the trucks worked. I mean, you -- you gotta give them credit. You don\u2019t have to like them, but you gotta give them credit."

Did you hear of Lourdes in your life, Lourdes, holy place, the Virgin, da da? Anyway, the train from [indecipherable] Sainte Marie was close by Gurs to my parents, goes from -- to Pau and then Tarbes. Tarbes is the big center, and the local train from my parent\u2019s place, Castelnot and further up, comes there twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Remember, it\u2019s war time. So I\u2019m sitting in this big -- you -- you know what the European rail station look like? They\u2019re like all glass, you know, tremendous ceilings and whatnot, you know? And I\u2019m sitting there, you have to wait for my train, I -- I got there li -- let\u2019s say 10 - 11 in the morning, or 12, and my train is at four or five in the afternoon, right? So I\u2019m sitting on the bench, waiting, looking around, nothing is happening. Tr-Train pulls in, and down yonder [indecipherable] I see two ladies. I says, oh, it can\u2019t be, it\u2019s my mother and my aunt. I says no, you\u2019re hallucinating. And as they come closer, lo and behold it\u2019s my mother and my aunt. Now my father knew I was going to get released that day, it was a Sunday, Easter Sunday. My mother and aunt had left before the message got to them, and they decided [indecipherable] for my uncle, who was Christian decided, let\u2019s go to Pau, couldn\u2019t hurt. Everybody else goes there for a miracle. Ah, what else we got to do? So they took the train to Pau, and then to Lourdes. And they got off the train from Lourdes because they had to change it at Tarbes, same that I did, and man was that emotional. Totally -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m telling you, truth is stranger than fiction, there\u2019s my mother and my aunt in the same station, the day I got released from the camp. Okay, fine. Now, how did I know -- get to know this little girl? We\u2019re waiting for the train, go into a compartment and then three people come in the compartment, a man around 50, woman around 28, and a real nice looking young lady around 17 - 18. Looks interesting, okay. The weirdest thing is they get up at the -- get off at the same station we did. My mother happened to know them, which she told me later, blah, blah, blah. They were Belgian. The f -- the husband must have been very rich because he bought the local castle, chateau, okay? And they also sold some dairy products. So the following morning my mother says, look, why don\u2019t you go up the road there and see -- try to get a few eggs, maybe something else, cottage cheese, whatever. I don\u2019t remember what. So I go there, and there\u2019s a big gate and two Dobermans, black things. No -- was never too fond of dogs, ever since I was bitten at the ripe old age of 11 by a dog to whom I didn\u2019t do anything. So I was ah -- but fortunately they didn\u2019t do anything to me. So, you know, a castle, big driveway, you know, circular driveway. So I walk on to the side entrance there, and that\u2019s where they used to sell stuff from. Th-Th-They were cultivating the farm, they were using the farm. And who 1s there? This magnificent creature. So now, I never lose time beating a dead horse. No, I knew this was going to work. I ask her, would she like to have a date, you know, something like that. So she says, I have to ask my -- whoever it was. Couldn\u2019t have been her mother. At 28 you don\u2019t have an 18 year old kid, I don\u2019t care what age you start. Relative, somebody, [indecipherable] brother-in-law, so [indecipherable] so the lady says, you sure don\u2019t waste any time. You know, says [indecipherable] so I picked her up on Sunday, and we hit it off pretty good, but it didn\u2019t last too long because after awhile the man of the house, who was 50, realized hey, what\u2019s this foreigner doing with my whoever it is, shall we say prot\u00e9g\u00e9e? Gets better. And I couldn't see her any more. So they locked the door, they locked the gates when I was supposed to pick her up. And his foreman was a big dude about six three or four. He says to me, you know, I like you, but if you know what\u2019s good for you, desist. Cease and desist. So I can take a hint. Funniest thing 1s one day while I was waiting for my -- let\u2019s say girlfriend to get ready, the lady of the house says, gee, would you like to see the place? Now you gotta understand one thing. This is not the United States. The United States I would have been shall we say a little more up to date and not as naive as I was, okay? I was -- you know, I was not necessarily shy, but -- I don\u2019t like to discuss things like that, but anyway. So she takes me up to her bed-bedroom. Carpeting that high, white. Now, what I didn\u2019t realize at the time is I [indecipherable] the spot, her for the little girl. She was going to get for -- go for me in a big way. But I was too dumb and young. I was afraid. The husband, big guy, look at the co -- position I\u2019m in, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m like under the gun with the police. All anybody has to say, I\u2019m dead meat. So she got very, shall we say depressed once they openly got together outside, the husband and the young lady. You always saw them together in the carriage, you know. You know, a s -- little horse carriage, you know, for two people. And she, from what the rumor had it, she jumped out of the first floor balcony, you know, trying to kill herself. Of course, she was -- she was going to make sure it wasn\u2019t deathly. So that was my story with that sweet thing."

And the truck stops dead. So we all have to get off the truck and push it up the hill until it starts cranking again. That was ver -- very strange things happen in life. And if you -- you can add meaning to it if you want to, or just add it to coincidences. So I -- personally I think it\u2019s coincidence you know, but whatever. So, but you can make things out of that, you know. And then I wound up with the Germans, and the first thing I know -- they show us where we sleep, and then they march us out to the worksite. Now, 5,000 people swarming around there, okay? They weren't Jews. We were the only Jews, eight of us. At that time they didn\u2019t know it, too -- n-no -- no -- they\u2019ve ra -- okay, let\u2019s put it that way, not everybody knew we were Jews, okay? So, they put us to work right there. I\u2019m facing a mountain of gravel a little bit higher than the ceiling, you know, like this is 15 feet, let\u2019s say 20 feet and a good 150 feet long. And they give us shovels, and we have to shovel wa -- I don\u2019t remember where, most likely in wheelbarrows. And we have to shovel that throughout the night. And I said to the foreman, in German -- German foreman, I says, look, I\u2019m exhausted, can\u2019t we get a little sleep? He says, a war -- there\u2019s a war on, nobody sleeps. That took care of my complaint, okay? Later on, being that I spoke German, he made me sort of like in charge of translating from him to the rest of the world, okay? So was pretty good because once in awhile we traded something for some food, you know, e -- they -- they got fed. We -- we got -- the -- the -- it\u2019s not a repeat of Gurs, but it\u2019s pretty close. Boiled pasta for lunch and supper.

They actually paid you. The organization paid you, not -- we happened to fall in there because we happened to be Jews, we don\u2019t really belong there, but we were there, okay? So one day he found out we were Jews, well that was the end of that. He came at night to scream at us while we were sleeping. And he happened to be a gay, and he had a retinue of young men with him, shall we say? And then, when he came time to get paid, well you know, they sit at the table there, with the paychecks and whatnot, you know? And well, by the time -- by that time he knew who was Jewish -- well, every two weeks, I guess -- and what he did when he saw us come up, he took his gun, and he put it on the table right next to the pay envelope. And you knew better than to grab for the pay envelope, okay? That\u2019s how we managed nicely. So one day he realized [indecipherable] that\u2019s not enough, I gotta get those guys. He called the Gestapo and one night when we came home from work, the eight of us Jews were taken off and put on train, in a compartment that\u2019s enough for eight, with the head Gestapo dude, and a soldier at each end of the train, do you -- the -- the car, you know, whatever it 1s, you know, what you call that, a b -- the unit, a car unit, so that you couldn\u2019t run out, whatever. And -- and the guy was very nice, but what he really was, he was trying to con these yi -- they were all young men, into revealing where their relatives and parents were, just in case they were hiding. And they were so stupid, I\u2019m tell -- no, the -- the young guys there, I\u2019m telling you. That\u2019s when I realized the whole world is not exactly what you\u2019re supposed to have heard about it. People are mostly stupid. I\u2019m telling you, how c -- you could fall in this trap? Write me a letter, I -- I\u20191] make sure it gets mailed, give me the address. And they did. How stupid can you get? I mean honestly, they didn\u2019t have the brains they were born with.

You know, I mean what the heck? He comes in there, hey -- hey Jews, we\u2019ll pick them up tomorrow morning, but I just wanted to keep them overnight. And the place was run by the German army, which wasn\u2019t really bad. And I remember in the morning they let us out to go and wash up.

There\u2019s eight of us, we\u2019re coming, get them out of the train, there\u2019s 40 black-clad, helmeted, armed, militia men for eight guys. They didn't know it, that was that -- how many we were. So they send him 40 militias. So -- and they told them -- and they only kept maybe a half a dozen to guard us. Put us in the truck and we wound up in this camp. And this camp was not for Jews or foreigners, this camp was for the French resistance fighters that were caught by the Germans, or by the French sympathizers. You know, either -- either or, right? And they were going to get deported to Germany to do slave labor. The Germans use any kind of slave labor they could get their hands on, and they were all young people, obviously. But this was a very upscale camp, as far as camps go. Clean, neat, beds. They actually had some decent food. I was shocked. But I know that this couldn\u2019t last, so after a few days -- now, it -- you gotta remember, I lived for five years with my uncle who was an officer in the French army, high ranking officer, and I used to hang out with all his cronies all the time, you know, the colonels and the majors and their wives, and all the -- because they used to take me over for tea. In France there\u2019s a big thing, you have tea in the afternoon, you know, little cake, whatever. So I was young, they used to schlep me, my aunt used to schlep me along, all the ladies liked me, you know, I didn't make the nuisance of myself, so I knew how to, you know, behave. And I had the nerve, I asked for an audience with the camp commandant. I had -- his name I remember. His name was [indecipherable]. He was a Corsican. Yeah, I didn\u2019t think he was that bad because after the war they had -- they h-hu-hung him as a -- as a war criminal, but I didn't think he was that bad [indecipherable]. Not for me, it\u2019s for the French people that he did in, you know? Anyway, so I said to him in my best military upper class voice, I says, mon commandant, I know we are miscast here, we don\u2019t belong here, and if you permit me, I would tell you who to contact to get rid of us. Lo and behold, think that I sound one of his kind, picks up the phone, calls the commandant of Gurs. Now I know the guy loved me, I worked for him for you know -- and he says, I got this guy here, blah, blah, blah, you know, I understand you are -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re in charge, would you take him? Oh, s-sure, send him over. So again, in handcuffs, on the railroad, you know [indecipherable] such a wonderful with the -- wi-with the regular people, you gotta understand.

And you know, the most touching scene I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, the whole administration of the camp was there to welcome us, on account of me. Now, that is touching. You know? The most -- the police inspectors that I knew. The boss, his assistant and whoever else, was a whole bunch of people. Really very touching. And at that time, the camp that used to hold on the average, 13,000 inmate, male, female or whatever, was down to 16 people. Germans worked very good. From 13,000 to 16, it\u2019s not bad.

They only needed administrative people. So they put us up, again I luck out. I got my own room, a real bed, a stove, you know? The only -- the only, the -- oh, 1-1t gets better, even. The only drawback 1s, in order to justify us, we all had to become lumberjacks. So they took us out in one of those famous cars. Was a Chevy as a matter of fact, station wagon."

            "answer": "A 1936 Chevy station wagon. And they drove us up in the woods, you know, like the mountains, the beginning of the mountains 1s woods. And the foresters had marked up the trees that needed to be cut. Now, they were all dead oak. Now, oak by itself is very hard. If it\u2019s dead, it\u2019s like trying to cut steel. Not only that, you had to clear away the underbrush, you know? So first you had to clear the underbrush, I had -- well, I had the -- the other guys with me, eight guys and me. Teams of two there with the saws. You know those long saws that slightly curve [indecipherable]. So I was the hatchet man, the axe man because I have experience in Castelnot as a lumberjack. I did that for quite a long time in the winter over there. They send me in the woods, they told me which trees to cut down all by myself. Anyway, so I have plenty experience, I was the axe man. So I was the one that had to clear the underbrush. And if you notice, if you look at the tree, the roots grow up like this. The roots don\u2019t grow underneath, they grow outside. And when they\u2019re oaks and when they\u2019re like a hundred years old, I mean we\u2019re talking. So you had to chop that up before you could get at the basic tree trunk, and the prerequisite was not like the lumberjacks over here with the power saw at arm\u2019s height like this, cutting the thing, no. You had to cut it right flush with the ground. Wonderful, wonderful exercise. And I have to decide which way the tree would fall, so I had to notch it in various ways, and then the saw team came and they went opposite of the notch, and -- and then we had to cut it in three foot lengths, you know, stack the wood, cords of wood, and split it. I mean, can you imagine splitting trees that big around? Oh, such fun. And then at night they took us back. The reward was, we ate in the noncommissioned officer\u2019s mess, and we wore civilian clothes. And that saved our life, because after a little while, the Germans in Pau, in the commandanture must have heard that there\u2019s some Jews around there someplace in Gurs. Will never do. So one night we\u2019re eating in the mess, and all of a sudden I see a pair of my favorite black suited militia come in. French. Okay. Get nervous already. Then I see another pair coming in. And another pair. So I said to the guys, we're all eating at the same table, I says, look fellows, let\u2019s not make it obvious. Let\u2019s just go out here one or two at a time like we\u2019re finished eating. We weren\u2019t finished eating but that was no time to stick around, right? So we got out and [indecipherable] out and we saw -- see, there\u2019s the main route, what they call route nationale was running alongside the camp. I told you, the camp was like a mile long. Would you believe they had truckloads of these militia men that surrounded the camp every 50 or a hundred feet, so that nobody could escape? So, what to do, you know? The guy\u2019s already in the camp, but I happened to be very good friends with one of the -- it was one of the older police inspectors in his -- must have been 40\u2019s or some like that. And he was married and he was still living in the camp, across the street in Quonset huts. Very civilized though, and he had two kids. So I have one guy with me also, big guy, but he was a real baby. He says, what are you gonna do, what are you g -- I says, what, I\u2019m going to try to sneak through the wire and run across to in -- 1t was night, and see whether this inspector would put me up overnight until they have left and done their dirty deed, right? He\u2019s like, please take me along, take me along. I says, hey man, what are you crazy, nobody knows you. Well, he made such a pest of mys -- of himself, I took him along. So -- you -- you remember, it was the war, so there\u2019s blackout, there\u2019s no lights anyplace. Knock on the door and either he or his wife open up the door, I says, blah, blah, blah --"

Now you gotta understand how good the French are. I listen to them being torn apart all the time, and I don\u2019t listen to this. She had two children. First thing she did, she took the kids out of bed, where did she put them to sleep, I don\u2019t know. Then, I haven\u2019t slept in a bed in how long, I don\u2019t know how long. She goes ahead and changes the sheet. I said, lady, you don\u2019t have to change the sheet. She changed the sheet. Now, you know why I say that. You couldn\u2019t get soap in France, or stuff you use to do a wash. I mean a -- I\u2019m telling you, it -- it -- 1t was a horror show. So she insisted on giving us fresh sheets. So we spent the night there, we slept together in the bed, of course, and then the following morning we went back and we saw how much damage the German did. Couple of guys managed to get lucky, but they got a few, you know. And then that was a signal for me that it\u2019s getting towards the end, you can not hang out here any more. So I took a gamble. I was -- I told you, when I was the orderly there at this little room, the recepti -- reception room, and next to me was the radio operator, you know, in touch with who knows what. So his name was Otis. So I go and see him, I says, Otis, gotta ask you something. Do you by any chance know anybody on the underground that\u2019s a guy that takes people over the Pyrenees? Took a gamble. Could have handed me over to the police, too, right, or the Germans? Says, let me see, come back in a little while. He set up an appointment with me -- for me with some mountain type guy, and we met, supposedly some sort of bridge, I -- I could get out, you know. I me -- I worked for the assistant and he -- he had the gate right behind his house, so I knew how to get out of the place without getting through the barbed wire. So I met him, and meanwhile it became known for some reason that I was gonna get out of the camp. And the next think I know, I got four guys bugging the bejeebers out of me to take them with m -- with me, along. There was only one drawback. After I saw the guide, he says it\u2019s -- argument-wise, 5,000 whatever it is per person. I says Okay. I had -- I always had some money, I worked. Even in the camp when I was the orderly I made money, fine. Always had money. But the other dudes didn\u2019t have any money. So what are we gonna do? I have to rustle up a fortune of money. So in the middle of the night we used to sneak out of the camp and sell everything we could get rid of, we didn\u2019t need. So eventually -- and then I went to some guy I know who had a lot of money, and I says, look, blah, blah, blah, I\u2019m shy so much money, how about it? So he gave it to me. So finally I have got all the money and when we went out the camp at night, was the winter anyway, it was January the 21, 1944 -- so I gave him the money and the money wasn\u2019t for him. He -- during the day they had to hide us in a farmhouse and the farmer had to feed us. In order to buy food they needed money, that\u2019s what the money was for. And you know the Pyrenees fooled me a lot. I had no idea, I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m naive in every re-respect. Only once though, you don\u2019t do it twice with me. But the first time around, anything goes. I saw the mountain, I says, oh, you climb that mountain, on the other side is Spain, no big deal. Imagine my disappointment when we get on top of the mountain, what\u2019s across the s -- from me as far as I can see, another mountain, just as high. Well, there were six of them. I\u2019Il make it short because w-we don\u2019t have a week. The last week -- the last day, we hit the glacier, we were that high up already, you know, past the snow line, glacier. Now, we weren\u2019t exactly dressed. Remember this is between January 21, and January 27\", alright? And in the mountains that\u2019s not exactly summertime weather. And especially without the proper equipment. So we hitting this glacier -- oh, by the way, those guides were all volunteer. They walked the whole night, and then they c -- they -- they could walk much better than us, then the following -- well, the following morning, they ran back to the -- their day job. Some of them were e-engineers on a -- on a train. Some did ta -- they -- th-they did that -- they didn't get any sleep for 24 hours. They did that without a nickel of remuneration. The money was strictly for the farmers so they could buy food for us. Logical situation, which we didn\u2019t know but we found out. So we climbed during the night. The reason that it took so long -- there\u2019s a perfectly good road that goes along in the valley, the only trouble is that it\u2019s patrolled by Germans, because that\u2019s the road between Spain and France. So we went over every mountain without any roads whatsoever. Was horror show. I once fell down the side of a mountain cliff just like that. And it\u2019s just like in the movies, th-the only thing that stopped me between heaven and earth, there was this shrub sticking out from that cliff. And I get ahold of it. So now I\u2019m looking up and I see the guys on top and I look down below. And the guides came, he was like s -- more of a mountaineer, right? You see, there was -- the pass was that wide, there was no light. And it had eroded, there was a hole like that and I didn\u2019t see, and I stepped right in that hole. The way we could see is -- you know what a musette is? That\u2019s like a bread bag that they have in France for the soldiers or for anything, a -- a bag, and they\u2019re usually in light canvas. So, was flung over the back from the guy, so that\u2019s what you were focusing on because him you couldn\u2019t see, you know? Phew. So he came and got me back up again. Oy. That was scary. I didn\u2019t scream, either. Not a peep out of me, I wasn\u2019t giving anybody away."

And it was on a cliff overlooking down below. After a little while, whatever it was, we\u2019re walking out of there and I\u2019m the last guy out and I happen to look down there. Down there\u2019s a German patrol with a Shepherd, and the Shepherd is barking to beat the band. Why? He smelled the other dog. Not us so much as the dog. Man, did we have to run, and the guy didn\u2019t even have any pepper or anything like that he could have sprinkled around on the track. That was a good one."

So after six days we\u2019re now faced -- oh yeah, excuse me. On the six days we met two more groups. One group was people that were very well heeled, with the proper equipment, you know, mountain equipment you know, and -- and the shoes with spikes, and then the right kind of rucksack, you know, and the nice warm clothes, you know, filthy rich people. They didn't like it any more either. I don\u2019t know whether they were Jewish or not, most -- more likely they\u2019re not. And lo and behold I inherit five allied flyboys. Four Americans and a British. They have -- have been channeled by the French underground all the way back to where our meeting point was. You know, the French used to hide them at night. You know, maybe they came all the way -- I don\u2019t know from where, but they were shot down over, you know, German territory. So for some reason they -- the rich people went their own way- they elected me as their leader. Okay? I\u2019m not a soldier or anything like that, I\u2019m their leader, hallelujah. Same way I was the leader of the other dudes. They all were older than me. So we\u2019re facing this glacier there, sheer wall. So the mountain man, he has this pick, you know this -- they got these things, they\u2019re those picks, and he\u2019s hacking a step into the ice, one step at a time. So here -- it\u2019s like a bunch of monkeys, we\u2019re all hanging on for dear life, one hand in this -- in -- in the step and the other one was standing there, and the guy in front of you 1s standing there. Finally you make it to the top. And the top is one sheer field of ice, going down like this. Anyway you want to look at, sheer ice. Well, we get to the top and guide says to me, well okay, this is th -- that -- this 1s one for the ages. You follow that river, and that will lead you to civilization. I said to him, river? What -- what the heck are you talking about? I don\u2019t see any river. I have 20/20 vision, didn\u2019t see any river. I says, you\u2019re in -- you\u2019re not going to leave me here. You take me where that river allegedly is. Comes with me and it was ice, I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s like I said, it\u2019s a sheer glacier. So -- and underneath, all of a sudden, there\u2019s a slight discoloration underneath the ice, it\u2019s grayish. He says, you see that? That\u2019s the river. You follow that, okay? That\u2019s how a river starts someplace, I guess. I can vouch for it because it turned into a river. So like good pedestrians, we walk on the right side of nothing, underneath the ice. And slowly, slowly -- if you ha-have ever been to New Hampshire, you see in those rapids over there, splashing over the stone. Scary. Not very deep, but scary when you don\u2019t know that. So all of a sudden, we\u2019re on the right side and there\u2019s no place to walk any more because there\u2019s a sheer cliff like that, the -- the river must have gouged it out. But the opposite side 1s perfectly nice and flat. There\u2019s only one thing wrong. By now that quote, no river, was maybe, let me see, I want to keep it within the framework of reality. Maybe 40 - 50 feet wide. And it\u2019s [indecipherable]. So we took off our shoes and then we looked whether there was a stone to step on, and we made it to the other side. Now the other side was mud, but was plenty room to walk, and it was like the Grand Canyon. It was completely gouged out like this, yo -- you know? It -- like a cover. And we kept on walking and walking and walking and walking, there\u2019s hours, you know. And the only sound that you heard once in awhile was the axe of a lumberjack, someplace, you know, that carries very far in the -- in an icy neighborhood and in the woods with no other noise, you know? And once in a blue moon we saw a Spaniard. Now, two of the guys were Spanish Civil War veterans, so they spoke Spanish, so [indecipherable] you know, whatever, so a -- ah -- they thought we were Spaniards. Here goes. We come around the corner, and we froze. What\u2019s in front of us like -- hard to say accurately, let\u2019s say 500 feet. A platoon of Germans with trucks and everything. I says, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. And you know who was the most scared? Hate to tell you. The soldier boys. They were going to hightail it. I says, boys -- I spoke English -- as -- not as well as now, but spoke some English enough to get by. I says, hold it. If these are Germans they\u2019re going to shoot you the minute you start running. Let\u2019s take it easy, they don\u2019t seem to be all that dangerous. They keep on staring at the Germans there. German helmet, German boots, German uniforms, German everything. Something -- and all of a sudden I saw what was different. The belt and the bandoliers were bright yellow. Well, the Germans are either brown or black. So then I knew they were Germans. So we had no choice but to walk up to them. So the allied sold --"

And so we walk up to them, and the other guys identified themselves as allied soldiers, showed their dogtag, whatnot. They put them on the truck, drove them to the nearby embassy in -- it must be Bilbao or some town there, I don\u2019t remember. Okay? They were home free. Us, we don\u2019t deserve, because we weren\u2019t the only guys that came across, we don\u2019t deserve no trucks. We haven\u2019t walked enough, only six days, or six nights. So we\u2019re walking, and we\u2019re schlepping, we\u2019re schlepping. The next thing we know, they threw us into a one cell dungeon, the filthiest place I ever seen in my life. Window up there, no place to sleep or nothing. So the following day we wind up -- I don\u2019t know whether we got on a truck, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t swear, I ga -- what I can\u2019t swear to, I\u2019m not saying. We wind up in Bilbao. Where did they take us? To Spanish Gestapo headquarters. Pure marble everything. I don\u2019t mean the outside, I don\u2019t mean the wall, I don\u2019t mean the floor. I mean the benches you sat on, all marble. This is after Franco [indecipherable], I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- this is 1941 -- \u201944, and the war is over in \u201939, and they were poor as church mice, proverbial. So each and every one go -- gets interviewed. Now, obviously we didn\u2019t come along with papers. Now being that I\u2019m as good as any Frenchman ever was, all of a sudden I\u2019m French. Took my France -- French name, birthplace, the whole thing. The only thing that I did, I lied. The only time in my life actually -- you don\u2019t have to believe me, but it\u2019s true. I fudged my age. All of a sudden I was 17 years old. I looked very young, I was emaciated, haven\u2019t eaten in four years. So, you know, I looked very young. They bought it. Saved my life."

Just as bad as the German concentration camps. Just as bad. So I wound up with the old people and the children. Fantastic. Wound up in a little rest -- no, first in town they put us up in a real nice restaurant, the first decent meal I had had in five years -- four years, okay? Of course I was with the French, you know, I was French. No paper, but I was French. And nobody was going to say I\u2019m not French. Nobody would believe me if I would have told them, which at one time I did, and nobody believed me anyway. Couldn\u2019t be. Couldn\u2019t be that I\u2019m not French. Okay, fine. So the following day they take us and we wind up in a small -- let\u2019s say town, way up in the mountain and in a nice, little hotel. Now I\u2019m living, together with older people, you know. I don\u2019t know how many, let\u2019s say 15 -17 or so. And we were plenty of food. The Spaniard for some reason had food, and I want to tell you how that came about. The -- they -- they tho -- spanic -- spa -- Spain is very arid and poor, and all they grew was olive and o-oranges. Well, how come they had food? Well, for every allied prisoner that they turned in to the allies, the United States gave them a 75 kilo bag of grain, or 175 pound bag of grain. Wheat. And they paid them X amount of dollars per prisoner. So they had a marvelous business to -- even though they were leaning towards Hitler -- you know, Franco, well, you can\u2019t pass up a good deal like that. The allies were smart. So they bought all of their prisoners and th-that\u2019s how come the Spaniards had food. And at for -- they got strangest eating ours, but that\u2019s not here nor there. At four or five o\u2019clock in the afternoon they made chocolate, you know, hot chocolate? But they don\u2019t make it like powder, they take chocolate bars, and you know when the chocolate is finished, you can put a spoon in and it stays upright, that\u2019s how thick that chocolate is. But we had a lot of nice food there. That didn't last too long. Then they threw me again in another camp with hundreds upon hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of French people, young people, also refugees from France, also in the mountains, and they put us 1n a -- well, that must have been the spa in peacetime, you know, like a big hotel, and with plenty of rooms, and -- and -- and dining room and things like that. So we stayed there for a little while and then they transferred us to another one that was actually even nicer, but by that time it\u2019s already going on towards spring. Now anybody that tells you that Spain is warm 1s mistaken, he has never hang -- hung around northern Spain, it is freezing. It 1s freezing. And we always had to get out there for the colors, you know, like -- you know, when they raise the flag and things like? One night we -- we had to stand there. One of their things, what can I tell you? And then we wound up -- oh yeah, and I -- I was under the misconception that oh, Pll get out of here in no time flat, you know, wound up in North Africa. So I never bothered learning Spanish. So one month goes by, I\u2019m still there. Two months goes by, I\u2019m still there. After three months a light goes on, I says, fella, you were vastly mistaken, you\u2019re net gotten -- you\u2019re not getting out of here so fast, better learn Spanish. Not bragging, stating facts. I learned perfect Spanish in three weeks. I was so good in Spanish that I used to write love letters for the -- for the fellas to write -- to send to the girls."

They knew your police record if you had one. They knew where you were born, you knew -- they knew your real name. That -- they let you tell them anything you wanted, but they wanted to investigate and they could find out. So naturally I didn\u2019t have any papers, I have to come clean. So what was my choice? The Foreign Legion. I wanted the French army, right? Couldn\u2019t do it. I wasn\u2019t French, you know, and they didn\u2019t -- you know. So I wound up in the Foreign Legion. And the Foreign Legion, eventually we were sent to Casablanca, you know, from[indecipherable] which is Gibraltar, to Casablanca, you know, these -- take the ship there. It\u2019s across the Straights, it\u2019s very- you know, the two oceans collide, the Mediterranean and the Pacific -- and the -- and the Atlantic, and let me tell you, it\u2019s not a peaceful meeting."

You see, what, where, how much, how fast, how big, how deep, what was the weaponry, what -- I had all that information and [indecipherable] to get a guy firsthand information, okay? So we were together with French Colonial troops and there also were Americans on the base. Now I said to myself, the Foreign Legion, I\u2019m not that crazy about it. From what I hear, it\u2019s not a place to be. So I saw 0 two army officers, American, coming by. Being that I spoke a little English, I went up to them, I says, \u201cGentlemen, excuse me, I would really like to join the American army.\u201d Oh, obviously they were from the quartermaster depot. They were uninterested, you know? That was my chance of serving in the American Army. I knew that the Foreign Legion was going to be the absolute pits of the world, which it was, but that\u2019s a -- you know. So -- and I saw the strangest things there. The Moroccans were the nicest of all Arabs, I tell you. The further east you go, the worst they get. The Moroccans are the nicest. The Algerians already, forget it. The Tunisian, no good. Libya, after that, forget, it\u2019s the end of the world. But the Moroccans aren\u2019t bad. They were real nice. That\u2019s the first time I saw pot. I didn't know what it was."

The Germans had to abandon all the cars that they took from the French trying to get home with them.

S-Same story all over the world, never changes. And then we slowly, when it really gets cold, we advance into Germany. Actually, we stayed in Alsace-Lorraine near Strasbourg for a little bit, and then, sometime later, must have been April or something, we crossed the Rhine at -- I don\u2019t know, a -- a -- a -- where.

I came over here -- of course, 1t was an experience, an eye- opener, because the United States, even though it was originally populated by white people from Europe, 1s so different from Europe, like night and day. There\u2019s no -- there\u2019s not even -- you can\u2019t even compare. The closest you could conceivably come to compare one with the other is Germany and the United States. But even that is really a stretch. The attitude, the mentality, the - it\u2019s totally different here. Look, I want to just explains to you how -- let\u2019s forget Hitler which was the worst thing in the world. Happened to the world, not just the Jews. Germany had social security under Bismarck, we\u2019re going back to the 19\" century, okay, okay? They were pretty advanced, right? You work in France [indecipherable] twice, doesn\u2019t matter who your boss is, you can change jobs five times a year. As long as you work a four months, you get credit for that four months. For every month you work -- I\u2019m going back to 1948 -- 46 -- \u201947, you get one and 2 a half days vacation, right? Which means 18 days a year, working days. Plus a bonus, not your salary, but a little extra, so you should actually be able to enjoy a vacation. I think that\u2019s very progressive. You\u2019re not at the mercy of a boss. This is state mandated. You retire at the ripe old age of 60 with 80 percent of your earning. Over here you get Social Security, if you make 20 percent you\u2019re doing real good. You -- you -- you know what I\u2019m saying? So there -- there are differences, and these are the large difference that you don\u2019t even know when you come here."

But that\u2019s the attitude -- you know, how can you -- in France I never had to ask for a raise. They came around to ask the supervisor, foreman, management, whatever, and says, who do you have that merits raise this month? You never had to ask for a raise, if you were worth it. And we\u2019re working on merit there, not on bullshit. That\u2019s the big difference. So it takes a little while to get used to this.
