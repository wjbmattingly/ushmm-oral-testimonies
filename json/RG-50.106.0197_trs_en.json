This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and\nwitnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. You have been interviewed before by the\nSteven Spielberg Shoah Foundation, but just to put this interview in a framework, I\u2019m going to\nsummarize where you were during the war and then we will focus on your post-Holocaust\nexperience. You were born August 9, 1937 in Berlin. Your parents were originally from Poland\nand you have an older brother, Mani and a sister, Rosa were eight and nine years older than you.\nYour family went to Antwerp, Belgium in 1938 and then in May 1940 you went to the French\nborder, but you were stateless because your parents had been from Poland. You went back to\nAntwerp and your father was called to work so your family left Antwerp and suddenly went to\nBrussels in 1941. In the summer of 1942, you went into hiding. The three children were placed\nwith a family, a non-Jewish family whose name was Coons. And then later you and your sister\nwent to the outskirts of the city to a children\u2019s home. And then after that your mother came and\ngot you and placed you with another family, the Von der Lindens. And then you joined your\nparents again and you went to Brussels and your mother came and got you from the Von der\nLindens right before liberation. So we are now up to the time of liberation. Before we go on\nthough, I just wanted to ask you if you had any early, early memories cause you were so young\nborn in the summer of 37. For instance about what happened at Dunkirk. Can you tell us a little\nbit about that?\nHarry Markowicz: Yes, that\u2019s my very, very first memory. It happened at the border. Or near the\nborder. We had been refused entry into France because we were stateless. And my memory is\nbeing in a ditch with my mother and other people.\n",

            "answer": "And there was a, on the road next to me there was a, well there was a British soldier, part of the British Expeditionary Forces that were stationed in France and Belgium before the war started and the officer was looking up in the sky with binoculars. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up he was gone and I asked my mother where was is this soldier. And she told me that the soldiers were gone. And she seemed to be afraid at this point. Later I learned that the British soldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk, which was just over the border of Belgium and France."

            "question": "All right, let\u2019s move ahead then to right before liberation. You said your mother came and got you from the family. Do you remember that?",
            "answer": "Yes, I remember because by this time I was very attached to the Von der Lindens, specially Mrs. Von der Linden and she was very attached to me, like a son. And my mother showed up. She came and visited me occasionally. But this time she came and she wanted to bring me to my parents\u2019 hiding place which was an apartment that looked like it was in a vacant building. And I didn\u2019t know why she wanted to come and pick me up. I know, I was a little upset and Mrs. Von der Linden, also. But my mother said that she, I could come back after the liberation. So I went with my mother. We took the street car. And at some point, at a stop, there was a German truck came by. It was being pulled by a horse. Apparently it had run out of gas. And there was also a soldier lying on top of the truck with a heavy machine gun. They looked very insecure. They kept looking around and like expecting some, maybe to be shot at which is, was the case. But I didn\u2019t know that. My mother said, going to that scene, she said, always remember this. Don\u2019t forget."

            "question": "And you still have remembered it? Very vividly.",
            "answer": "Right. I have not forgotten it. So then we went, I thought we were going to the apartment where my parents were hidden, but in fact we went around the corner where there was a beauty parlor. And I didn\u2019t know this before but one day my mother had been walking on the street around the corner and some German soldiers came in the opposite direction on the same https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 6 May 16, 2012 sidewalk so she got a little panicky and she went into the beauty parlor. And once she was inside, she was just standing there and the woman who ran this beauty parlor told her come in the back. There were, in many stores there was a living area, behind the store. And above the store. And my mother hesitated to go in the back. She was afraid. So the woman said that her husband was Jewish which was the case. And so they became friends and their backyards were connected cause they were at right angles to each other and there was a wall separating them but they made arrangements to go over the wall in case some danger would happen to one or the other. In several cases, my parents went over the wall. I don\u2019t remember these peoples\u2019 names, went over the wall. One time I know it\u2019s because the Germans came to pick up the Jewish family living in the house next door. So they didn\u2019t know that it was, 1t wasn\u2019t for them, so they went over the wall. And as it was getting close to liberation, my parents moved in with this couple and that\u2019s where my mother took me also. By this time, or maybe a day or two later you could hear the cannon fire in the distance. And so we knew that liberation was very, very soon to come. I remember once I was standing in the entrance of the beauty parlor and I saw, on the corner, I saw a group of men wearing khaki, but they weren\u2019t soldiers. I didn\u2019t know who they were and they were carrying cases, looked like wooden cases and they opened them up and they were distributing rifles to other men that came along. So I went back in the beauty parlor and I asked what\u2019s going on? Who are these people? And they were actually Belgians who were getting ready to join the fight against the Germans. Then again shortly after that, I don\u2019t know how many days went by, I think it was maybe one day or so. One morning my mother took me. She said we\u2019re going to go to, it was a park. I didn\u2019t know exactly why we were going there. And she said the English are there. I\u2019m not sure what she said actually but she said the English. She probably did but I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t know what that meant. And so we started going and I asked my mother, why isn\u2019t my father coming. And she tried to explain that he hadn\u2019t been outside, except to go to the beauty parlor for two years and he was not ready to face people. So we were walking along. My mother was kind of in a hurry and we were on one street. And we passed a tent that was burned. And I was fascinated. I don\u2019t know if it was, I assume it was a German tent, now looking back at it and probably a Molotov cocktail had been thrown at it. It was burning on top. And I didn\u2019t seen any soldiers, just fire. So I stopped to look. My mother said let\u2019s go and grabbed me, my hand and continued with a lot of https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 7 May 16, 2012 other people. Everybody was rushing to this park. And when we arrived there, there were tanks lined up in all the lanes. It was all very strange. There were a lot of, a lot of civilians around the tanks and everybody was happy and cheering and my mother took me towards a tank. There was a soldier standing on it. And we looked at each other. We looked at the soldier, he looked at us. And then he put out his arms, downwards and my mother lifted me up and he grabbed me and \u2014 (crying) \u2014 he pulled me up. And he held me in his arms. I looked at my mother and she said, give him a kiss cause we didn\u2019t have any way of communicating with him. So I did and then I looked back down and she was crying. So I couldn\u2019t understand. That was all, this job that my mother was crying and she said it\u2019s all right and I remember the soldier kept smiling as if it was ok. After that, I don\u2019t remember all the details but my mother took me back to the Von der Lindens like she had promised to do. But there was another reason. My brother and sister were by then they were living in the Ardennes. And my parents wanted to pick them up which wasn\u2019t easy because we had to go there by train or municipal trams maybe. But they weren\u2019t running. So and there was no communication so anyway I went back to the Von der Lindens and I didn\u2019t really know how long I stayed there. I only figured out a few years ago when I went back to the Von der Lindens. Every house on the street had a huge flag of the allies, American, British, French, Belgian. There wasn\u2019t a red flag. And these flags, I know how people made them. They were the size of double sheets hanging down in front of the houses. And then one day I went outside to play, as I usually did, but I quickly noticed that there were no flags on the houses. So I went in and asked Mrs. Von der Linden. She ran a store, sort of a hardware store. And she said that the Germans might be coming back and she seemed very anxious cause I didn\u2019t know this at the time. It was many years later that I figure out this was the Battle of the Bulge. So this is the way I know that I spent much more time with the Von der Lindens after the liberation than I originally thought because the Battle of the Bulge was in December. The liberation was in September. And so I was still with the Von der Lindens at the time of the Battle of the Bulge, several months after the liberation. Then after probably a short time after that, \u2019m not sure. My parents had found, rented a house and the apartment where they lived was much too small for our family. And so they rented a house, a nice little house and my brother and sister and I were there, but also my cousin Lottie. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 8 May 16, 2012 Her father was my mother\u2019s brother. And her parents had been deported on the last transport from Belgium. Number, it was transport number 26. They also had a son who had the same name as my brother Manfred, or Mani. They were together. At some point they were hidden together by a priest who was well known for having saved a lot of, hundreds of Jewish children. Father Joseph Andre who has been recognized by Yad Vashem and many other organizations. He placed the kids in convents or orphanages or in private families. But until he found the places they stayed with him. And both my cousin and my brother were with him when the Germans started watching him, suspecting that he was also involved in the underground. So he had to go into hiding himself, the priest. And my brother went to live with a family that was not really -- were friends of the family my sister was staying with in the Ardennes. But my cousin didn\u2019t have any place to go and so he went back to his parents\u2019 apartment and they were denounced. They were seen during an air raid, probably going to the shelter and they were deported. My aunt is the only one that came back. But they had a daughter, Lottie, who was hidden someplace else. So my parents took in Lottie and she was living with us. We still didn\u2019t know the fate of my mother\u2019s brother and his wife. One day his wife came to the house. I happened to be there alone one afternoon. The doorbell rang and I opened the door and there was this strange woman. Somebody I didn\u2019t know and she also looked strange a little bit. And she didn\u2019t say anything for a long time and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to let in strangers in the house and she didn\u2019t say anything and finally she, she said I\u2019m your aunt, Tante Dutche and I didn\u2019t recognize her. First two years had gone by since we had gone into hiding. But also she had been in Auschwitz during that time and on a death march. And so when she told me her name I let her in and my parents came home. That evening, after dinner, my aunt kind of spilled her guts, told the whole story from the beginning to the end and they were all very, very quiet listening to her. And also at some point she pulled up her sleeve and we all kind of looked or leaned over to see what was on her arm. It was her number tattooed on her arm. (pause) I had started going back to school. I, actually I was going to school already when I was living with the Von der Lindens. At first when they were living out in the country, it was a Flemish area. And the school was a Catholic school. There was Flemish which I didn\u2019t know. So that didn\u2019t help me very much. Then later when they moved into the city, I went to a French speaking school. But there were some gaps there. So when I moved in with my parents again I started https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 9 May 16, 2012 school but I was a year behind. And later I caught up. It was a very small neighborhood school and the fourth, fifth and sixth grade were in the same room. So I could hear and see what this, the class ahead of me was doing so by the end of the fifth year of school the teacher said I could go on to the seventh grade which was a, in like what do you call it here, junior high school. So I caught up there. In 49, my brother got his visa to come to the States. Since my brother and sister and I were born in Germany, but our parents were born in Poland, we the kids got visas earlier because the quota was shorter for Germans than it was for Poles. So my brother got his visa first. My parents were not that interested in moving to the States. They got established again in Belgium. They were happy there. But my brother wanted to go to the States. And shortly after that, that was in 1949. Shortly after that my sister got her visa and she joined him. They went to Seattle, Washington. And then in 1951 my parents got their visas. They had, I guess I could have gone to the States before but I was only 11 when my brother left so they didn\u2019t want me to go without them. We came to the States and arrived in New York, on the Queen Mary. And then \u2014"

And he joined the French Foreign Legion and was sent to North Africa. And his other brother went to Tangier with his family, his wife. And there was another sister who was also living in Paris with her husband and children. Her daughter is the same age as Iam. And after the war started, they were able to get out of France, go to Spain. And I guess maybe Portugal and then they caught the ship. They didn\u2019t have visas for any country but when they got to Venezuela they were allowed to get off the ship so they are the ones who survived. My father had three, two or three other sisters and his parents, they perished. They didn\u2019t survive. They were in Poland. On my mother\u2019s side there were 11 children, so ten siblings. Father had died before the war of natural causes. This, her grandmother and all her siblings they were still in Poland and of those, no I shouldn\u2019t say they were all in Poland. One aunt and husband they were in Hungary and then from Hungary they got to England. He was a cantor and so he got a job in, not in England, in Ireland. First. And so they were saved. Her, my mother\u2019s youngest brother, he and his wife went east when Germany invaded the Russian part of Poland. They went that way. And they were, ended up in Siberia. And then later after Germany attacked Russia, the conditions got better and there were many other Polish Jews were allowed to join in a Polish division in the Russian army. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 12 May 16, 2012 And they were sent to Iran, Persia for the oil fields, but on the way they deserted and went to Palestine, along with many others.

By this time, I think her husband had died already. And Arlene, my wife, asked why she took us in. Or my sister and I and that was the first time, I don\u2019t know why it never occurred to me to ask. What she said was that somebody knocked at the door and asked if she would be aware, if she would be willing to take in a child. She didn\u2019t say Jewish. She wasn\u2019t told it was a Jewish child and it wasn\u2019t us, 1t wasn\u2019t my sister and I. It was a young teenage girl and she stayed with them for a while and then their, they became concerned because she had a boyfriend and they were not very careful. They wrote to each other and then really all the, a lot of things which probably would have endangered them all if somebody had looked into it. There was censorship of mail. So they asked the organization to take the girl back. And so my sister and I were traded."

But it was like when the war, no when we were liberated and we all got together again as a family, I remember very distinctly my sister saying nothing happened to us. We were not caught and we didn\u2019t starve. So whatever we went through was the same as everybody else, except we were Jewish. There were some more complications. But we never, even though the word survivor didn\u2019t exist, wasn\u2019t used like it is now. But you would consider people who were in concentration camps to be, to have survived something. We didn\u2019t survive anything. We just, nothing. So we never talked about it. They never inquired about us. I guess after a while my mother learned that all her siblings and grandmother, sorry and her mother were dead and same with my father. I don\u2019t remember them every talking about it or -- With me. Or showing anything. I was a little surprised maybe. How come I don\u2019t know when I started feeling it. It was strange that they never talked about or showed emotions about it. But they didn\u2019t cry."

I didn\u2019t, I only learned this maybe a year ago so. I thought it was my father who would invite them but it was my brother and so we had a lot of soldiers. And also my mother had a cousin who was in the Jewish brigade. He would come to our house with a British truck and give me rides. I remember the there was a round sunroof and I\u2019d stand up on the seat. I didn\u2019t know then of course that he was using, the truck was used for bringing the refugees to I think Italy from where the departed for Palestine. And then you know before the war ended, an American came into our lives. It was my cousin in Ireland had married an American officer, a dentist. Her brother was a dentist too. They met in the same way. Her father had invited this young American officer who sort of was a rabbi, for dinner. And they got married. So and then he was sent to Belgium. He worked in the field hospital in Lieges which is quite close to Brussels. Belgium is very small. And he started coming to our house every weekend. Whenever he was off. And he was able to do everything. Fix things, things that my father would never be able to do. And so I was always happy to be around him. One thing. He used to be a great story teller but he also had a very loud voice. So with my, we spoke German because we didn\u2019t know English and he knew, he had learned German in school. And, at least he learned in school. I don\u2019t know where else. He spoke it quite well and sometimes we'd go out in public like to a restaurant or caf\u00e9 and he would talk but it was always in this booming voice in German. I didn\u2019t know where to hide. I\u2019d keep my distance because everybody would start staring."

Then the British were the . I mean that was my friend\u2019s argument. And then came the American soldiers, but like one of my friends said, his friend was communist. General Motors won the war. I had no idea what General Motors was. Who was General Motors? And since then I have, in a way that\u2019s been confirmed.

And so it didn\u2019t, I\u2019d say they felt it didn\u2019t suit them to go third class, tourist class. So we went second class on the Queen Mary. It\u2019s the front of the ship 1s first class and the third, the back of the ship is the tourist class. And second class 1s the whole length of this huge ship. But there were very, very few passengers in second class. If you can afford it you go first class. And there were no children. I was all by myself. I did meet a reporter for the Saturday Evening Post cause he didn\u2019t speak French and I didn\u2019t speak English. And he, I don\u2019t know if it was his girlfriend or what. There was a Chinese woman and by coincidence his sister lived, had lived for some time on the same street where I lived in Brussels. And so they took me around and sort of entertained me."

I went to talk, my brother took me to talk to the principal and he asked, the principal asked me what I had studied. And my brother translated. And since I had studied many things that they weren\u2019t doing in eighth grade in America, like studying math and algebra, geometry. The principal very wisely said well you can stay here. Normally we would have had to send you to a junior high school but he said you can stay here. The year is almost finished and it really is a time to learn English.

She didn\u2019t speak English. She spoke five languages. We spoke French to each other. Cause that\u2019s a minority language in Turkey. She had gone to French schools also. So we were married three years and then she was not happy, not, 1t was a difficult adjustment for her. Meanwhile her father and her other brother. Oh, actually she had two brothers. Two brothers came to the States and they went to live in Los Angeles and she, then she went to Los Angeles after we were married three years. Gail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer collection interview with Harry Markowicz. This is track number two and we were talking, that you were back in Seattle, going to graduate school. And how long were you, for how long were you in graduate school? Harry Markowicz: For over two years. I was working on my masters which I didn\u2019t get. I got into a program that they -- the university had set up between linguistics, psychology and French, literature, not French literature. And so it involved almost three departments and there were a lot of infighting between the faculty. So many of us didn\u2019t get our degrees because each one tried to get very high level of requirements for their field. And I was teaching French. Then for some reason two people in the same week told me about this new university in I forgot the \u2014 After that, sorry, after that I got a job in a community college in Tacoma, Washington. It was called Tacoma Community College. I taught French there for two years. Then these two friends told me about this new university called Simon Frazer University in British Columbia near https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 25 May 16, 2012 Vancouver and for some reason, both said this separately you'll fit in there. So I didn\u2019t know exactly what they meant but I called the chairman of the foreign language department, or maybe I\u2019m sorry linguistics. It was a combination. And I told him I was interested and he said ok come on up. This was 67. And we can talk. So after a few minutes he offered me a position as an instructor. I didn\u2019t have a transcript or anything. And then he introduced me to some of the people in the department and the French woman and she told me she was a graduate associate. I knew what a graduate assistant was because I had been one but it\u2019s a little higher level and more paid. So I went back to the chairman of the department and said what is this graduate associate thing. Can I do it? Cause I don\u2019t have a PhD and I'd like to work on it. He said oh sure, you can do that too. And so I, and they paid very well too. So I became a graduate associate and taught French and I got my MA degree there. Meanwhile, while I was there, I got interested in sign language, completely by chance. I\u2019ll make it very brief. I had in mind a research project involving linguistic universals which had become popularized or not only got popular but they were introduced by Chomsky, Noam Chomsky. And but it involved doing a little experiment with artificial languages to discover whether one could learn a language more easily if it had universals. But everybody already knows a language so that the experiment was not feasible until one day I read in a book called the Biological Foundations of Language that deaf children, before they go to school don\u2019t know any language. So I decided ah ha, that\u2019s my, those are going to be my subject. Just about this time there was a letter published in the Vancouver newspaper in response to an article which I had not seen. But the writer wrote that so and so, a deaf man has a little deaf girl, he and his wife are deaf. And have a deaf girl who was two years old and she has a vocabulary of, maybe she was two and a half, of several hundred signs which she combines in two word sentences. Two sign sentences. This was exciting because that\u2019s what hearing children in whatever language they learn. So I contacted the writer of the letter. He was a director of social welfare agency. And we talked and I also met a deaf man there. He introduced me to this deaf man he was writing about who I don\u2019t remember how we talked, having a long conversation. And it became clear to me that if you\u2019re deaf and you grow up in a deaf environment, namely deaf residential schools, that it\u2019s very similar to being Jewish."

            "question": "Why do you say that? https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 26 May 16, 2012",
            "answer": "Because you are in a minority and you\u2019re part of a larger society but you\u2019re always a minority. And the kind of relationships that develop among deaf people are the same kind of relationships you have among Jewish people. For example, a deaf American and a deaf Japanese may have more in common than a deaf American and a hearing American in some ways. There\u2019s a language aspect. There\u2019s a whole lot of, though later in my life I started writing about the community, the deaf community as an ethnic group. Anyway this became very fascinating for me. I got hooked. So I started reading books related to deafness and either the books didn\u2019t mention sign language or else they denigrated it by saying it\u2019s not a real language because it doesn\u2019t have articles. And it doesn\u2019t have a passive voice which is pure nonsense. There are plenty of languages that don\u2019t have articles or a passive voice, not a requirement for that to be a language. So that immediately got a rise out of me and the director of this institute for the deaf told me about a professor at Gallaudet University, William Stokoe who had worked on sign language. And suggested I contact him. So I did. And immediately Stokoe sent me back books, several books that he had written on sign language. So I, with my masters papers on sign language. This was in 1969, 70 at a time when sign language was not really accepted in America. So I -- it was a cause. It was not my cause. I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t fight for my cause, whatever that would be but I found that I wanted to take part in this fight for recognition of sign language and I could see eventually that it has to do with deaf civil rights. So that\u2019s what I did, get involved in. Eventually in what year was that. In 72 I came to Washington to go to Georgetown to work on my PhD at the suggestion of Bill Stokoe. And so I studied at Georgetown and then I started working at Gallaudet in William Stokoe\u2019s linguistic research lab where he did research on sign language. And it was funded by various grants, National Science Foundation and so on. When the money started running out, I was no longer working there. I worked there three years. And I had gone to Paris during the summer of 75 with several colleagues from Gallaudet. One in particular had a grant from maybe it was National Science, no it was National Endowment for the Humanities, a grant to study the historical foundation of American Sign Language, but its origins are from French sign language. So I was the French expert. My task was to go into the library at the school for the Humane school for the deaf in Paris and do research there on what was available on French sign language. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 27 May 16, 2012 There I met a sociologist who had some interest in deafness. And then he knew the history of, this history of deafness, the controversy. But he felt that all, he had been led to believe that with the new kind of hearing aids that were developed that that was not the problem anymore. And so we got involved and he invited me to stay with him and I told him what I knew that. So he, next, the next summer there was the world congress of the deaf took place in Washington. It takes place every four years. He came here and then stayed afterwards with me and saw what we were doing in the linguistic research lab. And then he asked me if I would like to go back to France, work with him, to get French sign language recognized in France. So I took a year. He got a grant there. And went to Paris. That was 76. Fall of 76. And the year stretched to five years. And in the meantime, after the first year I got married to my current wife Arlene who I knew already from Washington."

We don\u2019t even remember and, and so, once we invited one of their members to come to one of our meetings. We tried to get closer to them. This is a long time ago. Probably 20 years ago.

They didn\u2019t, the family didn\u2019t survive but the letters obviously ended up in the Museum. And I agreed to do it.

How do we know you're going to release, whatever one million Jews or whatever it was going to be. And Eichmann said you have the word of a German officer. So I started going to the library at the University of Washington and you know at that time, that was 57, it was very early. The French professor had used the word let\u2019s see, in English, no in French it\u2019s litterateur concentrasonaire, the literature of concentration camps. In France it apparently existed already existed already. But not here. So anyway, I went to the library and got books. I remember one specifically Bergen Bel was the title and it was all about Bergen Belsen. It was each chapter was written by a different person. Like an Englishman, soldier, an inmate from the camp.

In fact I had brought it to one of our meetings, child survivor meetings and I said that\u2019s not for me. And she didn\u2019t come back again. So I, but I know she\u2019s very interested. I tell her about the things that are going on. And the peril to the work, the various events that we get to participate in like the president coming to, to speak to. I got to shake his hand and I got a wonderful picture of it. But I don\u2019t want to suggest it, no.

There 1s a lot of emphasis on seems to me, on the bystander as being guilty for not doing something. Well to me that\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Just because there are injustices going around, it doesn\u2019t mean that you can specially being in an occupied country or in Germany, doesn\u2019t mean that you can just go out there and do something. I mean you can do something, get hit over the head and that\u2019s the end. A lot of the, ?ve become aware that a lot of the people were involved was due to circumstances. If (inaudible) And somebody came, knocked at the door and asked if they would take a child, didn\u2019t say Jewish child. She suspected it she said. Others, that woman who, Jeanne. Mademoiselle Jeanne, she was a school teacher. She was 20 years old, a school teacher and someone said kids were disappearing, Jewish kids. So she had this connection. She was then determined helping other kids. And I\u2019m now watchful. I\u2019m on the lookout and I see that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. With the priest in Belgium. There was also an aspect that he was asked or, so I see it\u2019s not that easy to just decide well this is not fair. Then I\u2019m going to go out and demonstrate or something. You can do that here under certain circumstances which 1s perfect as long as you\u2019ve got your permit or whatever. You can have a demonstration. But under the conditions that, in Germany and later in the occupied countries, I admire the white rose movement. Its but they gave their lives for nothing. Same with a lot of \u2014 another thing that gets to me 1s the myth about the Jews not resisting. There was of course some armed resistance. But it was futile. What does that mean. Countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Denmark, Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Holland. Almost Russia were invaded and almost they were defeated, not Russia -- almost. What does it mean to resist? Well there was resistance but it did take all kind of form. Every time you didn\u2019t do what they wanted you to do. Every time you didn\u2019t report to the work, when you were chosen or you didn\u2019t go to the place where you were https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 43 May 16, 2012 supposed to go so they can deport you. Or when you were supposed register. Hiding children. All these things were resistance. And so it, I\u2019ve been, that\u2019s bothered me for a long time."
