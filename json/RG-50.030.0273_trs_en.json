We had no relatives in America who could have sent us an affidavit or any place else where we could have gotten us out. The only possibilities for my parents were either to go to Palestine or to Shanghai in China which my father was afraid he would not tolerate the climate because he was suffering from aths ma. Then my parents at least wa nted me to get out and I had a fairly good chance. The director of the household school in Berlin had immigrated to England and she opened a children's home there. She sent papers to some of us young gi rls to come to England and work with her in the children's home, but somehow the papers me ant for me got lost. I have a feeling they must have b een sold to somebody and by the time the director was able to make out new papers it, unfortunately, was too late. So in 1938 when I came back from household school and moved in with my parents again th e persecution of Jews in Berlin had become quite bad already and then later on we were forced to wear the Jewish star. We had to take the added first names of Sarah and Isreal. Doctors, lawy ers and other professionals could no lo nger attend to their professions. Jews were not allowed in the university. In fact, already in '39 we were not allowed to go to the theater, to the opera, the movies even. So our life was very limited for us."

Unfortunately I could not quite finish it because before the end of it I was ordered to forc e labor. That was in April of 1941. And the forced labor I had to do was in a larg e commercial laundry on the outskirts of Berlin. I had quite a lengthy train ride getting there. At that time the war in Europe was on and British bombers would come over Berlin practically every night and bomb Berlin. So we, Jewish, forced labors worked on the four p.m. to midnight shift and we had to so rt dirty laundry for the German 5 army. Well, on my way home after midnight I was usua lly caught in an air raid on the train and had to go to a shelter at the Neil (ph.) station and sometimes I didn't get home till eight, nine o'clock in the morning.

Then the arrived in Lega after four days on the train. We arrived at the Skiatave ( ph.) freight station outside of Lega. And we were told by the SS that there were trucks available for the transpor t to the ghetto which was seven kilometers away, but there were not enough trucks for everybody. Just for the older and infirm people and everybody people would have to walk those seven kilometers. So my father got upon the truck and my mother was first standing in line next to me and then she suddenly said \"You know, your father might have di fficulty understanding orders the SS might give him,\" because he 8 was somewhat hard of hear ing from an accident in hi s childhood. So she left my side and got up on the truck with my father and that was the last time I ever saw my pa rents. I was barely 19 years old at the time. So the rest of the group of us marched towards the gh etto. The seven kilometers as I said. It was 40 degrees below zero. The snow was very deep and it was very difficult to march those seven kilometers. I was luck . Before we were deported a relative had given me ski boats and I was wearing these ski boats all through my time in concentration camp. Su mmer and winter. Um, so here every time, you know, somebody slowed down a little bit on the march, the SS would use their rifle butts and kick them in the rear to turn them on until we finally made it to the ghetto."

They took -- they were real anti-semitism. They took their jobs very seriou sly and, you know, they were, besides the hangings, the regular hangings of people who had bother ed for food -- by the way, the first transports that had come into the ghetto, when they first came into the houses they found that the apartments had been pretty much plundered. They had been de stroyed. All of the valuables had been take n out. But once in awhile hidden away some place we would discover a piece of jewelr y or something and then even though we had never gotten our own clothing in th e ghetto there was a clothing depot set up that -- where we issued our clothing and these things were used to bother on the outside for food. A piece of bread or whatever we could get. Because you could not live on the food rations we got in the ghetto. We were given 200 gram s of bread a day issued once a week and ____________ potatoes and old cabbage leaves and fish heads. And once in a great while a small portion of horse meat which was a great treat. So as I said, you had to supplement your food through outside bartering. Otherwise you could not exist. So you had to take your chances of being hanged. Sometimes one of our SS commendans wo uld shoot people on the spot besides the hangings. So we had shootings and hangings all the time."

They knew -- knew the language and also some of th em escaped from the ghetto and join ed the Protestants because they were able to speak the language and they could go in the country side and meet farmers and some of them got away with it.

            "answer": "Well, at first, as I said, we lived with the group that we had come with from Berlin in these houses. Some houses were literally like three story buildings. Others were just shacks, but all of them had outhouses. You know, they had no toilets inside. So -- well, life was still bearable because as I said, families were still together except for those who had been singled out and -- during the selections. This came la ter on that the families were separated. In the summer of 1942, that was the first summer there, there was anot her selection and 50 young girls including my girlfriend Stella who I met in Berlin, we were selected for a work detail at the Baltic (ph.) seashore. This was the best assignment ever . We had to fix up formally Je wish homes, Nazi confiscated estates that were suppose to be made ready for recreation pl aces for high SS officials and high German officials to come there for the -- during th e summer for their recreat ion. We were housed in the, what formally must have be en servants quarters and we had no water -- unfortunately we had no water. We couldn't was ourselves or bath. So at night after dark the SS would take us to the Baltic sea to wash ourselves. We got our food from a soup kettle. Thia was the most obstrensed (ph.) soup than the food we had ha d in the ghetto, so we could easily survive on that. We got bread. One man had been taken along from the ghetto beside s us 50 girls who operated the soup kettles. So then we girls also cleaned the homes for the occupants. I, myse lf, had the gardening detail. So 13 as I said, this was a very good assignment. You know, we weren't beaten. We weren't arrested much. Yes, we were under obse rvation of the S, but they pr etty much left us alone."

So I befriended five of the girls on this labor detail and we decided that once we would get back to the ghetto we would try to m ove together. Where as, you know, they all had been from different districts in Germany an d we had all lived in different places. So after the summ er was over we got back to the ghetto and our life went on as usual in the ghetto. We went on our work assignments and as us ual. Then in -- yeah."

It all had to do with the army, with the, you know, fixing up uniforms for the army and ship ments, doing shipping and pretty -- some work was very hard and we were very much abused by our captures. Others were not quite as difficult. You know, they were a little more lenient and so that was a little easier to handle. But all this time our life was in constant danger. Fi rst of all because of the bartering and a chance of being hanged or shot. And secondly, because of the constant selections. We were afraid to get sick, of course. Which happened to me and -- in the ea rly fall of 1943 I got very sick. I got jaundice and hepatitis. And I was put into the ghetto hospital which was set up instead by a German inmate doctors and nurses who were in the ghetto with us . There weren't many medications available for us, but over some weeks I got better. Never really regained my strength, but they discharged me after several weeks. But I was too week to go on outside assignments, so I -- oh, by this I forgot to mention. When we had gotten back , the six girls from the -- from the work commander at the Baltic sea, we did move together into a very old shack at the end of the ghetto that had been unoccupied. So we were under the jurisdiction of the Colon group. So now, when I wasn't ab le to out on outside work detail I talked to the chief of the labor assignment and told him of my predicament and he said \"Oh, I tell you what. You can help my older daughter Lilly who has to take care old my six young children because my wife goes outside to work to bring in some food for the family.\" Well, this for 14 me was great. I enjoyed being wi th the children. I enjoyed being with a family b ecause I hadn't had a family in all this time. I lived with my frie nds there in the, you k now, in the shack, but the daytime I spent with my friends there."

Which actually became worse later on. Well, anyway, while I was helping my frie nd Lilly to take care of these younger children I had a relapse of my hepatitis and the jaundice and I was taken back to the hospital. This was in the later fall of 1946. And I was in the hospital ag ain for several weeks and improved to some extent, but really not enough to be discharged. So one day my girlfriend Lilly who ha d visited me regularly at the hospital, came by ____________. There was no visiting time and she called me at the window and said to me \"I'm very glad to hear that you're comi ng out of the hospital tomorrow.\" Well, I understood immediately what that message meant and I told the doctor, the chief doctor in the hospital, that I would be leaving the hospital the ne xt day and he said \"Not with my permission. You are in no condition to be released from the hospital.\" I said \"With or without your permission I'm leaving.\" And so here I was barely able to sta nd on my feet, but I left th e hospital the next day. It so happened that Lilly's father, the chief of la bor details, had gotten wind of the fact that there would be a -- that the hospital would be evacuated. All these people would be sent away to their deaths and that's why he had told his daughter to warn me of that. So I came out. This was in November of '43. I came out of the hospital and sure enough a few days later the hospital population was taken out and put to death, but all the other ghetto inma tes had to stand for selection. And this time not only were the infirm people taken away, all the older ones who were left and there were not many of them, but mothers with young children. All young children were put to one side and we were asked at what plac es we had worked. And I of co urse have not -- having not had worked on the outside, li ed that I had been working at the Av iar (ph.) which was the army clothing depot. Otherwise, it would have meant death for me too. And luckily I got away with it. I was put 16 -- put on the right side. So all these mothers with the young children got taken away that time to their death."

So we had a fairly good idea and my girlfriend Lilly actua lly saved my life by getting me out there in time. Otherwise, I certainly wouldn't be around anymor e. So now, this meant, this was November '43, that meant the end of the Steliga (ph.) ghetto. All the ghetto inmates that were left were sent to concentration camp, Kisavold (ph.), outside of Le ga. And some of them stayed ther e for work details there. Most of us were sent to outside installations wh ere we were housed at our work places. So I was sent to this Av iar (ph.), to the ar my clothing depot where we we re housed in barracks that had double or triple bunks where we slept and we were given a me sket (ph.) and a canteen and we worked there taking care of the cl othing for the army.

Even other people had other work, outside detail work details, but all having to do with the army. In Ju ly of '44 a delegation came from Camp Kisserwa l and Viverman (ph.) had our hair ___ _________ off. So now we were all bald and we were given prison clothing.

            "answer": "Well, there were house and ba rrack there behind barbed wire an d we were assembled. Like I said, a 1,000 women were picked out for this work detail. Not all of us were from the German ghettos. We had Jewish women th ere from Laclia, from Lithoania and Istonia (ph.). All the three different countries. All the countries. So here we were in the Polish country side assigned to digging the trenches. We were hous ed in a wooden tent with high -- te nts. Like circle tents. Round wooden ply wood tent s. 100 women to each tent in two laye rs. One layer of st raw on the ground, a plank, a wooden plank, and another la yer of straw for the second layer. 50 on the bottom and 50 on the top. We were each given a horse blanket. That's th e only way that you can call it and, of course, there was no light, no heat . Nothing. In the begi nning it was summer. We wo uld dig our ditches and we would all, in the morning, we woul d first shovel a seat for Margaret and Gerta's moth er so that she could sit down in the green and we warned her when the gaurds were co ming closer to look busy and shovel the earth. We -- we girls would work harder to make up for her part of the work and we really dug these drenches which be came very difficult in the winter because we first had to loosen the ice and snow with pick axes before we even get -- could get at the earth. We also built barbed -- barriors across the road that were suppose to stop the Russian army from advancing. Now, in our tents here in this place we were, also we were gi ven very meger rations. We got the soup each day that was made out of potato peel s and ___________ _ and cabbage leaves and things like that, and really unsufficient for the work ew were doing. So at night, in the dark, we young girls, two at a time, we were four, we would sneak out into the fe ilds and steal turnips and potatos. The turnips we would eat raw and the potatos of course you couldn' t eat raw so we once in awhile -- while were able to make a fire and bake some poatos in the fire. We had, occassionally we had SS guards who 22 were a little more leaniant and who looked the other way and let us get away with that. So that was a special treat when we had baked potatoes. In th e -- in the tents we -- we were infected with lice and there were mice or rats rus tling around under the straw and we'd never forget any of them because as soon as -- as it got light they got away and so we lived with this . People got sick. There were so many that died. That I think at the end of this work de tail out of 1,000 women maybe there were 100 left. Not more than that . ____________ for it and dysentery and they just died off. I got sick too. I had -- I had intestin al problems too. My legs were co vered with open boils that were oozing puss. And I felt pretty ba d, but we got through this and th e mother of Margaret and Gerta got through with it. And this lasted from August of '44 till January of '45."

So in Ja nuary of 19 -- of 1945 a ll of a sudden we were asse mbled and we started on a death march. The SS wanted to get us closer back to Germany towards Germany. So here we marched. Had we stayed in Lega originally we understand that Lega was liberated in '44 already and I think in October of '44, so many more of us would have stayed alive, but the Nazis always took us a step further closer towards Germany an d here we were on this death march and marching day and night and all of us were really sick. My girlfriend Margaret was de sperately ill at the time. And, you know, I also had diar ea and things like that. And whoever wasn't able to march any further and fell by th e bay side would get shot by the SS accompanying us in _ ___________.

We moved on by the time -- there were just the five of us together. Maybe a few other wome n were with us at first, but eventually there were just the five of us. We went on because in the barn there was nothing to eat for us. We looked an d found another deserted farm h ouse where we moved in. And 23 the first thing was to kill the chickens and made chicken soup and gave it to our friend Margaret who I'm sure would not have surviv ed another week of marching. Sh e was that ill at the time. And she ate the chicken soup and then we found some canned cherries in the cellar of the farm house and she ate a whole jar of the sour cherries and that re ally cleaned her out. And from that day on she started to get better. Now, two days after the SS had left the Russian soldie rs started to march in, but they never really liberated us. We were just a hand ful of women and we to ld him that we were Jewish and had come from concen tration camp and they wouldn't be lieve us. They kept saying \"Nancy,\" and we were saying \"Y es, ____________. \" Which means I'm Jewi sh. But they didn't believe us.

And, so we tried desperately to avoid the soldiers ____________ of Nunmark (ph.). And we marched around the Polis h country side looking for one shelter after another and the farmers woul d sometimes put us up, gi ve us shelter in their attic and we would work or them. I did some sewing for them. My gi rlfriend Gerta mending socks for them. The others worked in the fields sometimes a nd so we found one place after the other. Sometimes we slept in a church and this went on for five months. Five months we struggled thr ough this and meanwhile, you know, I always thought coming back to the rapes, attempted rapes, I thought the soldiers would leave me alone because if they would see my legs with all the puss running out of the sores that they wouldn't be interested in me, but that never w ould have stopped them.

And that also saved us. So, you know, after th ese five months, practically fi ve months, of wandering around Poland sometimes we would be given, you kn ow, ____________ ____________ they had school lunches and they would give us some milk and potatoes to eat. You know, and other times the farmers would give us food for wo rk that we did for th em. So by this time we not only had the Russian authorities after us, but we also had the Polish militia (ph.) who was looking for us too. And, you know, the Polish, they are the greatest anti-semitist.

Took care of us for awhile and the mother by this time had a very bad cold and was really sick, but we didn't realize how serious it really was. So after we had stay ed there for awhile we also went to the si de of the ____________ ghettos which had been demolished by then and afte r awhile we decided it was time to move on and we wanted to try to get back to Germany. So with another piece of gold from Lilly we got on a train to Berlin and in Berlin we were some of the first refugees coming back and they had just set up a Jewish relief center. And that was opposite the Jewish hospital. And Margaret and Gerta's mother was immediately hospitalized. She had ____________ and even though she got good treatment there she died on us in Berlin. Which was very sad because after all she had gone through, three years of concentration camp, five months of wandering throu gh Poland, she made it all the way to Berlin and then past away. And th e hospital and the relief center were located in the British sector of Berlin. We met some British soldiers and they gave us money to bury the mother. I knew the large Jewish cemetery there and th at's where we buried her. So me anwhile, we had stayed at the relief center across from the hospita l and because they had just been set up they had nothing really to give us. They had no clothing to give us, so they gave us some blue, white checkered blanket covers from the hospital. Out of which they had sewing machines there. Out of which I sewed dresses for us four girls and these dresses were -- were all the ____________ in Berlin were our first clothing. Then after the mother had died some of theses British soldiers found us an -- a nice house in Berlin. There must have been Nazis living there who had fled and well, we made ourselves at home there. We took some of the clothing ther e. Then I found my Uncle in Berlin, in a suburb of 26 Berlin and he told me he wanted me to stay in Berlin wherea s I had intended to go with my girlfriend to Levitt (ph.), but he convinced me that it would be better for me to stay in Berlin since I was entitled to food ra tion in the Soviet after the war. And my other benefits we re two days where I had ____________. So he rented me a furnished room and the girls tried to get back to their homes in the west. On a British truck, you know, British army. But the first ti me they couldn't make it. They got stopped by the Russians at the boarder and were sent back. So all of a sudden they appeared in my furnished room, my furnished room again and we spent two more days together and then they made a second attempt. This time the British soldiers hid them among barracks on the trucks and they made it to the west. They made it to Margaret and Gerta' s house which was still found intact in their home town. And our friend Lilly stayed with them. So we were always in contact with one another. I had to find myself a job. I had to earn a livin g and I absolutely did not want to work for any Germans. I figured they were all Nazis and I'm certainly not going to work for them. And I managed to find myself a job with the American army that was sta tioned in the suburb of Berlin where I had my furnished home. I go t a job there in the office. That was the quarter master's supply people where all the American tro ops were supplied that were sta tioned all around Be rlin. And I was in charge of the supply."

As far as that was concerne d they all lied, but, of course, every -- every person at the age they could have b een Nazis. You know, I'm sure they were Nazis before and aside from some of th e girls that I worked with at th e base I really didn't have much contact. As I said, all my spare time I spent with this one Jewish family that had befriended me. So one Friday night in April of 1946, this Jewish family told us that they had obtained questionnaires from the American Joint Distributio n Committee to apply for visas to go to the Unites States for us -- for us, mostly girls who had returned and some fellows too. Some fellows who re gularly attended these open houses. And I, even though I was not that anxious to go to America because I had nobody there, but I knew I couldn't get to Palestine (ph.) at that time, so I fille d out the form to apply for a visa. And to my greatest surprise, several weeks later I was called to the American consulate and they questioned -- in fact, I had gotten -- I had just arrived at my office at the army base. I had not even had my br eakfast yet when I received a telegram from the Joint Distribution Committee telling me to come to the consulate. So I immediately went to the consulate and I was questioned there the whole day. Making sure I was r eally the person I claimed to be. I had by this time, I can show it to you later, I had a little thing like a passport stating I was a victim of fasisim (ph.) and at the end of the day they finally believed me and it didn't take that much lo nger then I got my visa. Through the generosity of President Truman who had allocat ed visas for this place person. From -- it was a complete supply and several weeks later there in May of 1 945 -- '46 excuse me. I was sent to Bromine (ph.) to the port of Bromine on my way to Amer ica. So I first notified my friends that I was coming to Br omine and all three of them, Marg aret, Gerta and Lilly came to Bromine We were housed there in the British ca mps they had set up and we were housed there four weeks before we left on a sh ip. And my girlfriends spent the whole week with me there which was absolutely wonderful. We ha d a great time together. And they saw me off. On the 14th of 29 May 1946 we were put aboard a liberty ship. It was, you know, a former American troop transport, the marine perch. And we were put aboard the ship on our trip to America. Now, it was quite primitive of course. Being an army ship we had triple -- triple bunks, but I really spend no time in the bunk at all. I spent the whole time up on deck because dow n below you would only get sea sick because everybody there got sea sick, so I stayed on top and our whole group had a wonderful time. We were on the ship for 10 days and we were supp lied there by the sailors with fresh food which to us was a real novelty and I was ne ver sea sick, so I could enjoy all the good foods that they offered me and had really a great time."

I couldn't stay there. So we all wanted to get out. My friends wanted to ge t out. So when we spot ted the Statue of Liberty as we were close to New York that was the biggest thrill of my life. So we landed in New York and the Joint Distribution committee was there to greet us and they put us up in a hotel and they took care of us. And what they had in mind was they were going to send, there were quite a few young girls among us and they had in mind to send us young girls out of New York because they figured we wouldn't be able to get j obs in New York and even, you co uld even get housing or even a furnished room was difficult to come by. It was shortly after the wa r when all the soldiers had come back, so they tried to place the young girls with Jewish families all over th e country. You know, to be baby sitters, household help to Jewish families and for some r eason I was absolutely determined to stay in New York. I don't -- I don't really kn ow why. I had nobody ther e. The only thing I had was my -- my Jewish soldie rs from my army base in Berlin had given me addresses of their families in New York whom I contacted a nd this somehow made me feel I wanted to stay here and even 30 though the Jewish committee told me I probably wouldn't be able to find a job in New York and I wouldn't find accommodations in New York I managed through thes e contacts to find myself a furnished room. I also found a job as a seamstress and so then I was on my own. You know, I -- I moved into the furnished room and I started a life on my own being a steam stress. Now, in the meantime, my health, of course , had been permanently impair ed through all the years of concentration camp and wandering around in Poland and I had this serious intestinal problem. Always pain and diareah and so, which was later on diagnosed as __ __________. So that made it very difficult. I mean , I went to work as a seamstress. I went to work everyday. I didn't even miss work even when I was running a fever, I went to work. And this went on -- meanwhile, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta were still at their home in the west. My girlfriend Lilly had found two of her brothers, two older brothers were aliv e and she found them back in Colon and they had gone to an Uncle in France and they were living in France at that time. Now, um -- I'm stuck. I had -- yeah, so a year after I had gotten to America, in fact, in June of 1947 I met my future husband at the swimming pool. I forgot to mention, my friends Margaret and Gerta came to America a year after me. They had an Uncle in Chicago and they settled in Ch icago. So meanwhile, I met my husband into the end of June of 1947 and three months later we got married because he had had similar experiences that I had except that he had come to Amer ica just before the war, but he us never able to get his parents out and his parents and younger sister were also killed in concentration camp. So for our wedding in Oc tober, my girlfriends Margaret and Gerta came to celebrate our wedding even though they were here only such a short time and had just started jobs. But they managed to come here a nd it was really wonderful. So, I mean, we were ab le to find, my husband and I got a basement apartm ent. You know, apartments we re very hard to come by and started a new life. I continued on sewing. You know, working as a seamstress. He had come back from -- from the service. He was in the American army and he was working in the post office, so we got settled in for a new life. And the only draw back was that I was sick so much. Th en in 1949 our son was born and after that my ____________ really got bad. Even worse than before and while he was quite young yet I was in and out of hospitals and that ma de it, of course, quite difficult 31 for my husband. He had to go to work and had to take care of the child after wo rk. He got some from cousins and from friends who he lped out, but in general, it was quite difficult. But all in all, we had a good life. And so, yo u know, we can't complain. We're very happy that we ar e here in this country and were able to start all over again. And in the mean time then just abou t three years ago to ad to my other aliments I got a very sever case of shingles in my head and my eye and because of my impaired immune syst em through all the years of concentration camp I could neve r get over it. I had -- I suffered a severely damaged nerve that leaves me in constant pain and, but you have to put up with it. You know, life goes on. We have a very close relationship. We have a 16 year old gr anddaughter and we have a very close relationship with our family and so life is good."
