He died at 55. I adored him. My father\u2019s family as I said was an old German family, totally assimilated. Sort of very comfortably off. Very cultural. My father\u2019s uncle was at the Berlin stock exchange and was ousted from there at the very beginning of 1933. I was the only child, over protected. First grandchild."

My father had just the one brother. My grand, my paternal grandfather came from a larger family and he came to Berlin as a young man.

But I mean I do remember the Seders at my grandfather\u2019s house and my mother always lit Friday night candles. My, as a matter of fact an old family friend would always say my mother was more Jewish than most of her Jewish relatives. My father always made Kiddush and I wish I had the sense to record it because he had a beautiful voice and did a wonderful, wonderful job. So this was a routine Friday night affair."

I remember Simchas Torah and packaging up little bags of candy and nuts for the children. He was really quite active. However, in those days they still had a maid.

However, later I found out that there was a Jewish orphanage and apparently quite a number of Jews living in Pankow. But at the time I wasn\u2019t aware of it.

Oh for one thing 1t was an economic move because that was the time of, you had the depression here and my mother as a matter of fact, took work. She worked at home. She was a fabulous dressmaker. In those days you know you had to go as a, what did they call them. To learn the trade and she worked for \u2014"

            "answer": "No well, when, when we lived, after we moved from Pankow, when things got tough, she brought work home. I remember her doing hand beading on gowns. Always a white napkin on her lap to make it easier to --. And always just before sunset or there would be an hour for her to play with me. That was our hour. And I think that was the primary reason why we moved. As a matter of fact my last few months in elementary school, I traveled by subway back maybe three or four stops so I wouldn\u2019t have to change schools. It wasn\u2019t worthwhile. It was the last year of elementary school."

And one mother took my mother aside and said Mrs. Friedlander I don\u2019t think Mrs. Meyer will come because you are Jewish. And that was my first awareness, yes."

As, in my dream as I was going home, in the street parallel to where I was, there was a parade with city and torch lights. And that dream occurred a number of times. So that I\u2019m still very, very much aware of it. I remember as though it was yesterday. And the discomfort until I got into the house. The apartment houses used to be locked at 8:00 so I always had to be sure that I made it before eight because I didn\u2019t have a key for the apartment house. So there was, I guess there was fear in me. And the other thing I do remember and that was really when we moved into the second building -- was the large swastika flags out of the windows everywhere. And to this day I have a dislike for putting flags out. It\u2019s, it must stem from that , why I feel that way."

Now I, what I remember was it supposedly was some bladder problem. I assume it was prostate cancer. But in those days I didn\u2019t even know they existed. And as I say, I was always shielded and I was not at home. My father belonged to a rowing club and I was spending the summer there, I suppose because we had one room there.

            "answer": "She was in her 50s, never married. She inherited from her father two tobacconist shops in St. Albans. She had a very nice house with her housekeeper named Helen. I remember getting there and having tea. And I was not a tea drinker. Tea to me was something you had when you were sick. So being a kid, I finished quickly. Get it out of the way. And I was asked, do you want another cup of tea. And I said thank you. Meaning, no thank you. And to my horror there was another cup of tea. And then with the third cup I realized, I said no thank you. I remember being out in a very pretty garden of theirs, sitting on one of those slide things. I\u2019m not even sure whether I lay down and slept for a while but then the neighbor came over and she had two girls I believe. And she was asking me whether I could ride a bike. And I didn\u2019t understand her so she motioned with her hands and I thought she was talking about somebody boxing. Funny how certain things stick in your mind. And then going to bed and seeing if anyhow I was used to feather beds and seeing this flat thing and not knowing what to do with it."

            "answer": "Ok. Let\u2019s backtrack a little bit. Miss Kingham was about to get married to a friend Oredor [ph] who had a 20 year old daughter who had been expelled from college. And did not talk to the father or the father wouldn\u2019t talk to her. He had no idea that I was on the horizon. So when he came for the weekend, he was confronted with me. Nota very happy situation. And his daughter, Susan, then stayed in St. Albans with me. The marriage took place, I think, ten days after I got there. And he was what I considered a typical Englishman, polite. I called her aunt and him uncle. And when war broke out, he asked me. It was a Sunday. He asked me who did I want to win the war. And his wife said you know that\u2019s a ridiculous question to ask. And I said yes it is. And then he said well after all she\u2019s German. So you get an idea what the climate was. And then shortly after that we moved to Ipswich on the east coast. He was head postmaster of there and about six or seven smaller towns around there. In a new modern home, very nice."

The school was about a mile away and I had to walk it of course. They had a maid named Joan who finally taught me how to ride a bike. And but for a good couple of months, I walked back and forth to school. And one or the other teachers would pick me up when they saw me. And later on I found out that they were so impressed about me being able to converse about Loretta, you know small talk. So my English obviously had improved. It had to. The thing of my experience was a new language is that the ear actually has to accustom itself to the sounds. And once that happens you\u2019re on your way. But the school was a life saver for me."

I stayed, incidentally I stayed with that first family just a year because during the war being head postmaster, he would receive advance notices of air raids. And he made that or they made that a reason that they could not have me stay there. I was an enemy alien which was the term used. So there was one other  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Vera Levine 26 February 7, 2013 Jewish family in Ipswich and they invited me to tea. They had an eight year old boy. And I realized immediately what they were after was a mother\u2019s helper. I wasn\u2019t thrilled about it. And then lo and behold, Ipswich had its first air raid siren. That\u2019s the siren -- no raid. And the family packed up, one, two, three and moved to the Midlands to a sister. And I was off the hook. So the school was very instrumental to find a place for me. And it was one of my, one of the teachers said she would take me. And she lived with another woman who had a girl, two years younger than I, also a Jewish refugee, Doris. And I moved to them, very happily. And then the two women had an out. Well actually Joan Bailey invited an air force man, I guess must have been British into the house. You know special occasions or what have you. And the teacher Miss Mobey felt this was not appropriate. So she moved out and I had the choice to go with her or to stay with Miss Bailey. And I opted to stay with Miss Bailey. First of all there was Doris, the other girl. And it was a nice house and so on and so forth. But I stayed on very good terms with the other teacher. Like I went with her to her folks. Her father was a minister who absolutely adored me. They lived in a very old house in Shropshire. I can\u2019t remember the name of the town right now. Right in the center of the town, the house was in all the guidebooks. It was fascinating. And I remember sitting at the desk, writing letters when somebody waved to me, from outside the window. It was an American tourist who asked whether they could come and see the house. That man, that minister told me that he was going to pray for the safety of my parents every day. And I would have sworn my life on the fact that he did. He had a, in those days, he had to learn Hebrew. And he was in great respect, almost a little bit of envy, great respect for Jews. And I am sure he did exactly what he promised he would pray for my parents."

And in the beginning we would go into the cupboard under the stairs which was considered the \u2014 was the safest place in the house. But after that we put a mattress into the shelter and we would go to the shelters. And being kids we wanted the raid to last until after I think it was 2:30 because then school would start an hour later. When we had raids, we first of all had lots of practice at school to get into the shelters. In the shortest time possible. We had to go across two hockey fields. And when we did have raids, we would sit in the horrible damp cold shelters, watching the time. Hopefully we would miss math you know. Things like that, typically kids\u2019 stuff. The only one time that I -- that stands out in my mind was when the gasworks in Ipswich were bombed. And kids from the other side of town, everybody commuted on bikes. On their way to school would see human remains that were in the streets. And came to us and talked about it. That was the only time that I remember us kids really being badly affected because it was so close to home . And it was one of our own kids that saw it.

I was lucky because most of the people there would be sent to places that manufactured gun powder and because I was an enemy alien, I went to a place that for ferrous and non-ferrous metals which was great. First of all much more variety and more interesting. And I worked there. As a matter of fact I was working there when I got the news that my parents had survived. And then my friend in London who was part of the refugee committee, community, found an article in the paper that the American government was looking for bilinguals. For employment. And she told me about it and I applied. Now I was two years below their minimum age. After I found out that my parents had survived I moved heaven and earth to get over to Germany to help them after the war. And I was too young everywhere. I even wrote to the Russian commissar or something in December. And I never heard from him though. And I applied to the American government. What happened was that they had hired 200 bilinguals from France. The Alsace area where they have bilinguals. And at the last minute the French government nixed it. They said they couldn\u2019t spare the manpower. So the American war department was kind of desperate so they took me. Me and, I and one other girl. We were the same age. We were two years below their minimum age. And I was accepted by them and went to Germany to, to Munich for censorship. We censored mail, telephones and telegraph. And it was, by the way, it was very traumatic for me that train from -- because I saw children begging along the way. And we would throw out whatever you know K rations we had and all of a sudden I realized these were not friends anymore. These were German children and it had a terrible effect on me. And then an older man, older, he was probably like in his 20s, late 20s, saw my distress and we talked about it. It was a terrible thing for me to realize that the kids looked just as bad in France as they did in Germany but hey, these were Germans after all. Anyway we got to Munich and I started working. We were actually posted in a camp that was owned by Martin Berman, Martin Berman yes who was never found. That was a great camp, very nice housing. And we lived there but worked in Munich. We had a daily train back and forth to take us to work.  https://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Vera Levine 35 February 7, 2013 And what was deadly boring. First of all the letters were written poorly, on poor paper. That was hard on the eyes and terribly boring. And then I found out that they had a research lab on base. And I checked into that and met the guy who was in charge of one section of it, Robert. I talked to him. And he arranged for a transfer so I didn\u2019t have that train trip every day. I could go to the PX in peace when most of them were still in Munich and I ended up marrying him. That was my husband and we worked in secret ink and code."

So when I got to my parents, I went to bed. My father at that time was employed by the Russians and they heard that I was coming home to them. And they celebrated with what my father was, not a big drinker was imbibed by the time he got home but it was -- and my grandmother as alive. That\u2019s the big thing. My grandmother was alive. It was wonderful. It was so, unbelievably wonderful. I carried a big bag of provisions with me that was a story in itself. I could barely lift it and when I got off the train, I had to make arrangements for transportation to get into this subdivision in Berlin itself. And finally managed that they gave me a young kid with ajeep. And from there I got another kid with a jeep to take me to Pankow. And he was scared silly because it was in the Russian sector which in those days the city was still divided. And I had to guide him which was very difficult because landmarks and streets that I recalled were no longer there. Everything was in ruins but I managed to find my way home. My mother was hanging out of the window, waiting for me. It was -- I was there for seven days. I got back once into the American zone. And to get my PX rations to take back to them because cigarettes were the main means of, of paying for things. Money wasn\u2019t worth anything. That was before they had the currency reform in Germany. So I lost quite a bit of weight because I couldn\u2019t, I could barely eat anything in my parents\u2019 house because you know it was so short of food. But it was a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time. My poor mother never got her little girl back."

Nobody would sanction the order because I was entitled, well he was entitled to one trip for me but not three trips, not going to New York and then coming back and going back the third time.

But it was all right. And my mother in law was a very, very difficult person and caused us a lot of grief but we never had -- it was never a question of in law problems, it was mother problems.

And at age 60 I was -- and Berlin paid everything for me, my husband and one other person. I think they figured at that age we needed some help so my daughter went with us. And it was worthwhile. There was no question about it. I found the same apartment house where I was living as a child in Pankow. I found the only club where I had so many happy hours. I think that was one of the most emotional things.

            "question": "I asked you what you thought about Germany.",
            "answer": "What I thought about Germany. I can\u2019t begin to tell you. Berlin wallowed in apology. You, wherever you went you had memorials for what happened. There was one very arts board. It was typed in black but stenciled out with dates and numbers of people and destinations that were sent to the concentration camps. And one of the most -- almost like a Times Square kind of area. I couldn\u2019t believe it. By that time I realized there was a difference between the young people I saw and people my own age. If it was somebody from my own age, I always wanted to ask how many did you shove into the ovens? My whole attitude about Germany has been terrible before I knew that my parents had survived when the first atom bomb go off. My reaction was well then my parents are alive or not they should have used the atom bomb 1n Germany. If I met anybody German it was difficult for me to disassociate them from my feeling about the Germans. I had utter disdain for the people as a whole. When I went back to work for the American government in Munich, I saw daily this business about well I didn\u2019t know what was going and I said Dachau and people told me they didn\u2019t know what was going on when the railroad tracks led right into the concentration camp. I, if they -- if somebody would have said to me, yes I knew and too bad Hitler didn\u2019t manage to get the last Jew, I might have had some respect for them. But this -- I\u2019m a little person. What could I have done kind of baloney. It didn\u2019t sit well. However, when I did go to Berlin later on, I realized that, I mean I was surprised at all the signs of regret. That\u2019s putting it mildly about what happened to the Jews. Now I realized that Berlin, that northern Germany was very different from southern Germany, at least the Munich area. And probably still is. But it\u2019s, it took me a long time to get over this neurotic feeling about Germany and the Germans. And I also felt that my hate was like a, a comfort blanket for my own preservation. But you know times have changed."

And that\u2019s where you found out about me, I suppose. I found that fascinating. I met somebody else there who I didn\u2019t even think he was Caucasian, but he was Jewish and a wonderful, wonderful man and we had great conversations. I think the museum is fabulous.
