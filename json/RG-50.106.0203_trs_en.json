Always a white napkin on her lap to make it easier to --. And always just before sunset or there would be an hour for her to play with me. That was our hour. And I think that was the primary reason why we moved. As a matter of fact my last few months in element ary school, I traveled by subway back maybe three or four stops so I wouldn\u2122t have to change schools. It wasn\u2122t worthwhile. It was the last year of elementary school."

So that I\u2122m still very, very much aware of it. I remember as though it was yesterday. And the discomfort until I got into the house. The apartment houses used to be locked at 8:00 so I always had to be sure that I made it before eight because I didn\u2122t have a key for the apartment house. So there was, I guess there was fear in me. And the other thing I d o remember and that was really when we moved into the second building -- was the large swastika flags out of the windows everywhere.

            "answer": "Ok. Let\u2122s backtrack a little bit. Miss Kingham was about to get married to a friend Oredor [ph] who had a 20 year old daughter who had been expelled from college. And did not talk to the father or the father wouldn\u2122t talk to her. He had no idea that I was on the horizon. So when he came for the weekend, he was confronted with me. Not a very happy situation. And his daughter, Susan, then stayed in St. Albans with me. The marriage took place, I think, ten days after I got there. And he was what I considered a typical Englishman, polite. I called her aunt and him uncle. And when war broke out, he asked me. It was a Sunday. He asked me who did I want to win the war. And his wife said you know that\u2122s a ridiculous question to ask. And I said yes it is. And then he said well after all she\u2122s German. So you get an idea what the climate was. And then shortly after that we moved to Ipswich on the east coast. He was head postmaster of there and about six or seven smaller towns around there. In a new modern home, very nice."

            "answer": "Well it was getting better. But I do rememb er waking up at night, searching for a word in English. You know the brain was so I guess overworked. The school was about a mile away and I had to walk it of course. They had a maid named Joan who finally taught me how to ride a bike. And but for a good couple of months, I walked back and forth to school. And one o r the other teachers would pick me up when they saw me. And later on I found out that they were so impressed about me being able to converse about Loretta, you know small talk. So my English obviously had improved. It had to. The thing of my experience was a new language is that the ear actually has to accustom itself to the sounds. And once that happens you\u2122re on your way. But the school was a life saver for me."

            "answer": "In Ipswich yes. It was Allsgate school for girls. It was fantastic for me. I stayed, incidentally I stayed with that first family just a year because during the war being head postmaster, he would receive advance notices of air raids. And he made t hat or they made that a reason that they could not have me stay there. I was an enemy alien which was the term used. So there was one other Interview with Vera Levine 26 February 7, 2013 Jewish family in Ipswich and they invited me to tea. They had an eight year old boy. And I realized immediately w hat they were after was a mother\u2122s helper. I wasn\u2122t thrilled about it. And then lo and behold, Ipswich had its first air raid siren. That\u2122s the siren -- no raid . And the family packed up, one, two, three and moved to the Midlands to a sister. And I was off the hook. So the school was very instrumental to find a place for me. And it was one of my, one of the teachers said she would take me. And she lived with another woman who had a girl, two years younger than I, also a Jewish refugee, Doris. And I moved to them, very happily. And then the two women had an out. Well actually Joan Bailey invited an air force man, I guess must have been British into the house. You know special occasions or what have you. And the teacher Miss Mobey felt this was not appropriate. So she moved out and I had the choice to go with her or to stay with Miss Bailey. And I opted to stay with Miss Bailey. First of all there was Doris, the other girl. And it was a nice house and so on and so forth. But I stayed on very good terms with the other teacher. Like I went with her to her folks. Her father was a minister who absolutely adored me. They lived in a very old house in Shropshire. I can\u2122t remember the name of the town right now. Right in the center of the town, the house was in all the guidebooks. It was fascinating. And I remember sitting at the desk, writing letters when somebody waved to me, from outside the window. It was an American tourist who asked whether they could come and see the house. That man, that minister told m e that he was going to pray for the safety of my parents every day. And I would have sworn my life on the fact that he did. He had a, in those days, he had to learn Hebrew. And he was in great respect, almost a little bit of envy, great respect for Jews. And I am sure he did exactly what he promised he would pray for my parents."

But after that we put a mattress into the shelter and we would go to the shelters. And being kids we wanted the raid to last until after I think it was 2:30 because then school would start an hour later. When we had raids, we first of all had lots of practice at school to get into the shelters. In the shortest time possible. We had to go across two hockey fields. And when we did have raids, we would sit in the horrible da mp cold shelters, watching the time. Hopefully we would miss math you know. Things like that, typically kids\u2122 stuff. The only one time that I -- that stands out in my mind was when the gasworks in Ipswich were bombed. And kids from the other side of town, everybody commuted on bikes.

First of all much more variety and more interesting. And I worked there. A s a matter of fact I was working there when I go t the news that my parents had survived. And then my friend in London who was part of the refugee committee, community, found an article in the paper that the American government was looking for bilinguals. For employment. And she told me about it and I applied. Now I was two years below their minimum age. After I found out that my parents had survived I moved heaven and earth to get over to Germany to help them after the war. And I was too young everywhere. I even wrote to the Russian commissar or something in December . And I never heard from him though. And I applied to the American government. What happened was that they had hired 200 bilinguals from France. The Alsace area where the y have bilinguals. And at the last minute the French government nixed it. They said they couldn\u2122t spare the manpower. So the American war department was kind of desperate so they took me. Me and, I and one other girl. We were the same age. We were two years below their minimum age. And I was accepted by them and went to Germany to, to Munich for censorship. We censored mail, telephones and telegraph. And it was , by the way , it was very traumatic for me that train from - because I saw children begging along the way. And we would throw out whatever you know K rations we had and all of a sudden I realized these were not friends anymore . These were German children and it had a terrible effect on me. And then an older man, older, he was probably like in his 20s, late 20s , saw my distress and we talked about it. It was a terrible thing for me to realize that the kids looked just as bad in France as they did in Germany but hey, these were Germans after all. Anyway we got to Munich and I started working. We were actually po sted in a camp that was owned by Martin Berman, Martin Berman yes who was never found. That was a great camp, very nice housing. And we lived there but worked in Munich. We had a daily train back and forth to take us to work. Interview with Vera Levine 35 February 7, 2013 And what was deadly boring. First of all the letters were written poorly, on poor paper. That was hard on the eyes and terribly boring. And then I found out that they had a research lab on base. And I checked into that and met the guy who was in charge of one section of it, Robert. I talked to him. And he arranged for a transfer so I didn\u2122t have that train trip e very day. I could go to the PX in peace when most of them were still in Munich and I ended up marrying him.

            "answer": "Well it -- first of all I got very sick and Robert had made me promise that if I didn\u2122t feel better I would get off the train in the British sect or and go to the hospital, but of course I didn\u2122t listen to him. So when I got to my parents, I went to bed. My father at that time was employed by the Russians and they heard that I was coming home to them. And t hey celebrated with what my father was, not a big drinker was imbibed by the time he got home but it was -- and my grandmother as alive. That\u2122s the big thing. My grandmother was alive. It was wonderful. It was so, unbelievably wonderful. I carried a big bag of provisions with me that was a story in itself. I could barely lift it and when I got off the train, I had to make arrangements for transportation to get into this subdivision i n Berlin itself. And finally managed that they gave me a young kid with a jeep. And from there I got another kid with a jeep to take me to Pankow. And he was scared silly because it was in the Russian sector which in those days the city was still divided. And I had to guide him which was very difficult because landmarks and streets that I recalled were no longer there. Everything was in ruins but I managed to find my way home. My mother was hanging out of the window, waiting for m e. It was -- I was there for seven days . I got back once into the American zone. And to get my PX rations to take back to them because cigarettes were the main means of, of paying for things. Money wasn\u2122t worth anything. That was before they had the currency reform in Germany. So I lost quite a bit of weight because I couldn\u2122t, I could barely eat anything in my parents\u2122 house because you know it was so short of food. But it was a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time. My poor mother never got her little girl back."

And at age 60 I was -- and Berlin paid every thing for me, my husband and one other person. I think they figured at that age we needed some help so my daughter went with us. And it was worthwhile. There was no question about it. I found the same apartment house where I was living as a child in Pankow. I found the only club where I had so many happy hours. I think that was one of the most emotional things. I found and Interview with Vera Levine 40 February 7, 2013 went to the synagogue where we had gone a couple of years for the high holidays.

            "answer": "What I thought about Germany. I can\u2122t begin to tell you. Berlin wallowed in apology. You, wherever you went you had memorials for what happened. There was one very arts board. It was typed in black but stenciled out with dates and numbers of pe ople and destinations that were sent to the concentration camps. And one of the most -- almost like a Times Square kind of area. I couldn\u2122t believe it. By that time I realized there was a difference between the young people I saw and people my own age. If it was somebody from my own age, I always wanted to ask how many did you shove into the ovens? My whole attitude about Germany has been terrible before I knew that my parents had survived when the first atom bomb go off. My reaction was well then my par ents are alive or not they should have used the atom bomb in Germany . If I met anybody German it was difficult for me to disassociate them from my feeling about the Germans. I had utter disdain for the people as a whole. When I went back to work for the American government in Munich, I saw daily this business about well I didn\u2122t know what was going and I said Dachau and people told me they didn\u2122t know what was going on when the railroad tracks led right into the concentration camp. I, if they -- if somebody would have said to me, yes I knew and too bad Hitler didn\u2122t manage to get the last Jew, I might have had som e respect for them . But this -- I\u2122m a little person. What could I have done kind of baloney. It didn\u2122t sit well. However, when I did go to Berlin later on , I realized that, I mean I was surprised at all the signs of regret. That\u2122s putting it mildly about what happened to the Jews. Now I realized that Berlin, that northern Germany was very different from southern Germany, at least the Munich area. And probably still is. But it\u2122s, it took me a long time to get over this neurotic feeling about Germany and th e Germans. And I also felt that my hate was like a, a comfort blanket for my own preservation. But you know times have changed."

I think I gained from it a much broader outlook on things than I would have had if things had been normal. Yes I, I was once called oh here is the happy one. We went to see one of the Kindertransport movies. In a theater, I think it was in Philadelphia. I\u2122m not sure. And afterwards they asked if any of the Kindertransport people were there. And there were about half a dozen and stood up too. Behind me somebody said oh here is the happy one.

The pictures of the signs on stores and no J ews and stuff like that. It, can I say it leaves me cold but it has no impact anymore. There are other things of course that impact me greatly. But I, when I went down to find you people, that was wonderful. I, you could research your family or friends. I had never been there be fore and we stayed until the last minute really. And that\u2122s where you found out about me, I suppose. I found that fascinating. I met somebody else there who I didn\u2122t even think he was Caucasian, but he wa s Jewish and a wonderful, wonderful man and we had great conversations. I think the museum is fabulous. It\u2122s absolutely fabulous."
