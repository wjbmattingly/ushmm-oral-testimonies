            "question": "Tell me about when you were born and the town where you grew up?",
            "answer": "| was born in a little village by the name of Forth, which is 23 kilometers north east of Nuremberg. It's between Nuremberg and By-roit (ph). By-roit (ph), the famous Wagner town where the fesh-beeler (ph) had taken place. And | lived, | was born in this village in July of 1913, shortly before the outbreak of World War |. And hardly got to know my father because he died, to some degree as a result of World War |, in 1919 when | was hardly six years old. | lived in the village and went to the grammar school, which then was an all-Jewish school. Which is interesting because the town, the little villages around Nuremberg had become centers of Jewish life when Nuremberg was not, | mean it was no longer permissible to live in Nuremberg. Nuremberg was one of the so-called principal cities and it was only, | believe, in the middle of the 19\" century or early 19\" century that the Jews were again allowed to live in Nuremberg. And that is, at that time, when the Jews began to leave these small villages. When | grew up, the village had a total population of probably 1,200 and a Jewish population of maybe ten families, enough to have a so-called Minion (ph). But it wasn't long, and | would say it was in my third year of grammar school, that the Jewish community could no longer afford to have the Jewish teacher and also he had doubled as a Huss-in (ph). A Huss-in (ph) is who holds the prayers on Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 2 [Date not labeled] Page 2 Saturdays and Jewish holidays. Then the Jewish kids were being transferred to the so-called government school, which was in the main, a Protestant school. We also had a Catholic school. And |! went to, | attended the government school for a period of two years and then, because of the lack of better educational facilities in the village, | moved to a so-called , a boarding house in Nuremberg and from there went to High School. That for a period of six years. Thereafter, | took a job. It is well to mention that on weekends, when | started to work, | would visit my mother and Aunts who lived in the village, twenty-three kilometers away. Anti-Semitism began to become noticeable. And | never forget an incident. Nuremberg had a deep, what do you call it? . A fortification. And we played soccer there. And one guy with a hammer and sickle on his cap came to assist us to, to ward off a bunch of Nazi kids."

            "answer": "They wore swastikas and they called us dirty Jews, etceteras. Now the Nazism in certain schools was so strong that it was necessary for the Director of the boarding house to have me transferred to a school that was less stigmatized and coincidentally, the school from which | had to be transferred was near the courthouse in Nuremberg where ultimately the War Crimes Trials took place. It's, there are so many things that are unusual coincidences in my life, that some, that was in 1924, and | interrogated the Chief of Staff of the German Army, Ky-kle (ph), in 1945. And he had to get up and salute me. Also one of the many unforgettable incidences. To bring us more up to date, beyond the period of time that | had gone to school, and when | started to work for a company in Nuremberg and that was in 1930. And it was from then on that | would regularly visit my mother on weekends. This brings us to the time when the Nazi propaganda began to become extremely aggressive and particularly then, in the year 1932, when in spite of the enormous propaganda that was being put over the German people, Hitler's popularity began to shrink. And there were two elections. One was in the summer of 1932 and one was in the fall of 1932. And particularly the election in the fall of 1932 reflected a decrease in the popularity of Hitler. Which ultimately then, on January 30\", 1933 led to Hindenberg's decision to appoint Hitler Chancellor of Germany. It was followed up by another election, at the beginning of March of 1933. Which Hitler won only in combination with all the other parties other than the Social Democrats and the Communists. And it was so deeply unfortunate that these two left wing parties had failed to really create one common front. History would have been different, at least my belief. After the Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 election, when Hitler considered himself in sole power of Germany, then the wave of Anti-Semitism was enormously increased and this was the time when already Jewish stores were being pilfered or destroyed. And it ultimately led to a very important, personal incident. On one of the visits in the middle of March to my mother's house, | was hardly at home, when there was a knock on the door and a policeman, the local gendarme, came into our living room and said, \"Mr. Schnaittacher, | would like to see you at the police station.\" When | arrived at the police station, he very briskly told me that | was under arrest. And again, it was one of these painful, painful moments when | had to call up my mother, who had a severe cold, and | had to tell her, \"Mother, I'm under arrest.\" Well, she was shrieking and she came storming out to the police station protesting that a War widow should be treated like this without any reason whatsoever, but obviously it did not do any good. My village was too small to have a prison of it's own and so | was transported to the County seat of Earl-la-len (ph) where | then, as dusk began to settle, was put into a cell in the police prison. And | was being welcomed by four or five other prisoners who had already been in there, as a result of having been anti-Nazis, not Jewish, but anti-Nazis. Shall | continue?"

And he then, either that night or the following morning, gave me a slip of paper which indicated that | was arrested because of having agitated against the National Socialist Government because of knowledge of secret ammunition depots and liaison of illegal anti-Nazi organizations. Now, actually, yes | was an anti-Nazi. I was no longer involved in anti-Nazi activities. So the actual reason was to provide the local populace of the village with a degree of satisfaction, to have me arrested as a Jew. And another cousin of mine who was the only other young male Jew in the village. And it was quite an experience. As | was given the easiest job in the prison, and that was to fill, we didn't have running water in the cells, but each one of us would get a water pitcher. And it was my job to fill the water basins that we used to wash ourselves with. And to fill these pitchers with water. And in doing so, | turned around and there sits my cousin in the adjoining cell. Well we had a very friendly greeting, and surprising so. The moment that! had gotten into prison my mother did not rest for a minute and pursued every possible approach in order to have me liberated, as well as my cousin.

            "question": "Let me take you back just a little bit. You mentioned that you were an anti-Nazi but weren't involved in anti-Nazi activities. What did it mean to you at that time, or what kind of activities had you been involved in? What was sort of the culture of anti-Nazism where you were living, when you were | guess about 20 years old? With your friends? What were you talking about? What were you doing?",
            "answer": "Well we would have seminars to gain an understanding of what it would mean, of what Nazism meant and what it meant not only to the Jews but the people at large. The total oppression of several areas and after all, when, | want to be sure that is right. When Germany finally collapsed there were over 300,000 non-Jewish prisoners in concentration camps in Germany. And the anti-Nazi forces were, they were primarily the Social Democrats and the Communists. And who really fought Hitler physically and with all the idealism and principal and firmness possible. But | had the opportunity, after | was released not only from prison but from the parole, to travel as a salesman within limited scope. Not by car but by train. And | never forget that some very simple people who had taken the same train | did in the vicinity of Munich, that they expressed without fear when they recognized me as a Jew, that Hitler is the enemy of all of Germany. By the way, | failed to, when | corrected myself before with regard to the time that | left prison. And because of the danger of again being re-arrested in Nuremberg, | left Nuremberg and moved with an Uncle of mine Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 in Munich. And it was May 1%, 1933. The reason that | am pointing out in this very interesting coincidence, | came back to Munich on May 1*, 1945, as the conquering American soldier after having liberated Dachau. I'm not speaking of myself but my regiment, my division, and it was to be sure one of the greatest moments in my life."

            "question": "You mentioned that you were afraid in Nuremberg, that you would be re-arrested. Was there a sense that they were watching you? It seems that if they arrested you when you went home and you didn't live there, they must have somehow known you were coming?",
            "answer": "Well, yes, there was the fear that one could be re-arrested and then it would not have been a police prison but it would have meant to be sent to the concentration camp of Dachau. Now Dachau at that time was not an extermination camp but it was a camp of terror. And personally violent persecution. At that time the, a few friends of mine were shot in Dachau. And the proverb, if you can call it that, was created: shot while attempting to escape. Now, so | lived in Germany having been relieved from the duty to report to police stations, and | had the goal, as soon as possible, as early as possible, to be able to leave Germany. And particularly so because on a visit to Nuremberg, not to my village, | had arranged, my mother had arranged to meet me in Nuremberg in order to spend a pleasant weekend together. When she came home from that visit, she was ordered by the Mayor of the village to come to the village counsel and she was told, Mrs. Schnaittacher, if you have been here today, during the day or yesterday, we would have arrested you. We give you the opportunity to defend yourself. My mother had been extremely courageous and Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 she screamed at them that if they wanted to arrest her, they should do so right now because the following day she was going to leave the area to live with her mother. And that's what she did. And that, the , the precarious actions of my mother, and my Uncles and Aunts, was my never-ending burden and sorrow here. | had, and that is, goes for so many of the refugees. We had an interesting, rewarding time here. Cost of living was extremely low and even though | only earned at the beginning $13.00 a week, it was fully adequate to keep me alive. And to enable me on weekends to go hiking and we had a wonderful time. It is interesting to note that this now is the late fall of 1933. My brother had lived here already. He came, not because of the Nazis, in 1929 at the behest of an Uncle of mine, who lived here, had lived here for some years and had a going business and was not married and therefore didn't have any other children. And my brother entered his business and later on | joined him. We lived in the utmost of comfort, earning $13.00, $15.00, $17.00 a week. On 96\" Street and Western Avenue. Across the street from the, what's the name of the hotel? The Hotel Paris, which had a swimming pool and we could go swimming every night, for 25 cents. And it was really a wonderful way of living. Burdened only by our concern for our in Germany."

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9",
            "answer": "Yes indeed. There was my mother, two spinster Aunts on my father's side. There were two brothers of my mother's who were married. And one of them had three children. And my mother insisted that | should leave as soon as possible after | was able to get a visa. And | left with a great deal of reticence because of leaving my mother over there, but she promised that she would visit me. And indeed she did the following year. And stayed in America for over six months. Then because of her love for her mother and the feeling of obligation that she had for her, she came back to Germany in order to take care of her mother. And it was then, only after the Crystalnaught (ph), after my mother suffered a nervous breakdown, that she and her mother, and Uncles and Aunts and cousins, all ultimately were brought over here. So we were extremely fortunate that we didn't lose anybody in the Holocaust. [End of Side 1 of Tape 1]"

            "answer": "Right. So this brings us up to 1939. And when my mother was the first member of the family after myself to then come back in order to remain here. And we hada small apartment on Western Avenue and 80\" Street. And then we, where some cousins had lived, and myself. And when my mother came, we rented, no, first she stayed with my Uncle, and then later on when her mother came as well, we rented an apartment on 151% Street and Broadway. Which is the southern part of Washington Heights. And at that time it was just a wonderful neighborhood. You never, day or night, you would never fear of any attack or of any incident.

And then, when other Uncles and Aunts came, we just doubled up. There was never any complaint. There was only the utmost of happiness, to have succeeded in bringing our relatives out of Germany. And even as far as, which is of some significance with regard to the question that has been raised, the integration of refugees into American life. There was an Aunt of mine who then was in her late 30's or early 40's, and she didn't have any children. And she and her husband, through another friend of theirs, started to pull threads out of pieces of cloth in order to separate them. And they started to do that in our dining room. And from there they developed a business where ultimately they employed some forty people on 26\" Street and Broadway. And when my Uncle and Aunt ultimately died, they took care of their nieces and nephews, not having had any children of their own. And that went for ever so many of the people, that no job was low enough as long as they were able to sustain themselves. Whether young women that worked in households, or in factory jobs, notwithstanding, very good educations. And this, | think, is one of the unique aspects of this immigration."

            "answer": "Well that's a very good question because it leads me to one of the most satisfying experiences that | had. As | had mentioned early, | had worked for my Uncle who Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 11 [Date not labeled] Page 11 had a wholesale business of glassware and chinaware located in Munich. And when he came over here, he told me the following story. When he approached as it was customary his place of business on the morning of the Crystalnaught (ph), the manager of the business, not Jewish, to wnom | had been reported when | worked for him, was standing at the entrance to this business in the uniform of a storm trooper, and said, \"Jews are not allowed here.\". And my Uncle did not protest because he recognized the threat that was behind him and he turned around, went home, and within a few hours a Nazi knocked on his door and arrested him and took him to Dachau. And the same thing happened to his brother, who lived some hundreds of miles away from where he lived. So my two Uncles were taken to the concentration camp and that was in November 1938. And finally they were able to get out in January of, | believe January of 1939. The Uncle with whom | had lived, the one who had lived in Munich, because of the totally inadequate clothing that they received in Dachau, suffered severe circulatory problems and that\u2019s what he died from some years later. But this is the story that he told me. So now, we go back, or we advance to the year 1945. Fritz, as a member of the 157'\" Regiment of the 45\" Division, contributed to the conquest of Munich. And as soon as | had the time to follow up on this story which | told you, | went into my Uncle's place of business which had been bombed out, but people were there. And | inquired for the name of Hermann. Hermann was the name of the fellow who had been the manager of my Uncle's business, who was responsible for sending him back home and having him arrested and taken to Dachau. And so this is now May 1945. And | finally got Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 information as to where Hermann lived. And | had the deep, deep satisfaction of locating him, having been an officer | had the privilege of a jeep, and | drove out there. And people gleefully would point in the direction where Hermann lived. And there he was. | recognized him at once. And he just wore pants and long johns. And | told him in a not too friendly a manner that he should get dressed. He didn't recognize me. His wife and daughter protested vehemently. And | took him to the CIC Headquarters in Munich where | interrogated him. And fortunately for me, because here | was on a war of my own, and which was not allowed, but | found out that he had been the guard in a concentration camp. Which made him subject to automatic arrest. Eisenhower had declared the so-called automatic arrest category and you as an American soldier could arrest anybody who was guilty of certain crimes, such as having been the guard at a concentration camp. _| didn't tell him who | was until | finished the interrogation and | said, \"Do you know who | am?\" And he said, \"No.\" | said, \"My name is Schnaittacher.\" So he said, \"But you should know how much | did for your Uncle.\" So | said, \"Yes, indeed, | do know.\" And with that | turned him over to the CIC, who were less humane than | was and at least he was put away in prison for some months.

My Dad, keeping in mind your possible interest in our integration in American life, that this was also the period of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. And most of us, of course, or all of us, were most sympathetic to the role of the Republican government in fighting Franco. And certainly, ultimately, in fighting Mussolini and Hitler.

And we were stuck there until we started our offensive that was really thought to end the war. And that was about March 15, 1945. Now from then on, or within a week thereafter, there was hardly a town or village that was of significance to my family or myself, that we didn't conquer.

And then had some unique experiences in bringing about the surrender of more German outfits by apprehending the fortress commander, putting him in our jeep, and wherever we went, he said, put your arms down.

And one of them stepped out and said, \"Lieutenant, didn't we go to school together?\" And | lifted his helmet, recognized him at once, and said, \"Yes, Lesline (ph).\" Lesline (ph) was hisname. \"Wedid.\" And he said, \"Fritz, let me gohome.\" | said, \"I can't.\" Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 16 [Date not labeled] Page 16 lf we have time, | could tell a very humorous story which happened the following day. We had taken Bumberg (ph) and we had probably about 500 prisoners in a churchyard. We had more information than they did, there was hardly any purpose in interrogating any of them. | just walked around to hear their voices, to hear what they were talking about.

He had been, he had become a Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 21 [Date not labeled] Page 21 prisoner of war so he wasn't back yet, but his wife was back and | helped her out with some money. And then | drove back to my house and by then, as coincidence would have it, that the gendarme who had arrested me in 1933 was there to welcome me back. Of course, | didn't shake his hand and he had, | didn't hold it against him because he had acted on orders, which he couldn't refute in 1933. Then | drove the following day, no, | ordered the gendarme to bring to me the Mayor and to bring to me other people whom | had suspected that they had removed the last few Jews and had sent them to Dachau, or to Auschwitz. And so the Mayor came and | ordered the Mayor to give instructions to the town crier that all Jewish property that they had stolen should be brought back to the Mayor's office. Nothing came. Then | drove to Schnaittacher in order to visit my father's grave and to instruct the Mayor of Schnaittacher to repair the cemetery because many of the gravestones had been used for construction purposes.

And Fritzi, who had been abroad from Africa on, through Sicily, Cer-learn-no (ph), Ansio (ph), he hardly had missed any landing in any campaign. And experience had taught him that most important is to have food because very frequently during these campaigns the regiment would outrun the kitchen and you had to live off the land. So he said, \u201cLieutenant, we've got to keep soul and mind together. And we are going to go to the ration dump.\" The very first day that we were getting ready to go aboard ship in Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 32 [Date not labeled] Page 32 the afternoon, and he said, now you have an interesting story to tell because you only came from America a few days ago, and these guys were guarding the ration dump, anxious to hear this story. So you keep them fascinated with your story while | go into the ration dump and when | see, by then it had been dark, when | see some boxes that look interesting and promising, I'll whistle, you'll follow my whistle and I'll throw the boxes across the fence. A very tall fence. So | followed his instructions and there | can catch one box, two box, three boxes. And we saw ourselves eat canned chicken for days to come. We couldn't wait, but we had to wait because you were not allowed to strike a match or a flashlight. So we couldn't wait until the following morning when we woke up aboard ship. And what did we get? The boxes were in our jeep. We got three boxes of canned peas. But we lived through it. And we exchanged the peas for other stuff, as it was customary. Interesting was the very first day that we were aboard ship, about to land, and he was ahead of me. And | saw my first German prisoners. At that moment | could have killed every one of them. Until | was able to talk to them. And then that disappeared. And having been totally inexperienced in the, not just the art of questioning, but what kind of information we wanted to have, | got the most important strategic information, how to end the war within a matter of days. And, whereas, Fritzi had known the regimental Commander, a Colonel O'Brien, for a long time and he had gained his confidence. The Colonel came to me and said, well what do you know? And | told him that. And, without changing the expression of his face, he turned away from me and said, Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Fritz Schnaittacher 33 [Date not labeled] Page 33 Fritzi what do you know? Well, that didn't last long. | learned. But! never forget that one."
