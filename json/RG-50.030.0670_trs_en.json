            "answer": "I was born in Berlin, in a place called Elssholzstrasse, which is located across a park which has something to do with what happens eventually. I was born November 30, 1925, and I lived in Berlin until 1938, when my family escaped from Germany. My father was a \u2014 at that time was working in textiles. He was also born in Berlin, as was his grandfather, and probably generations beyond that. And he was in the army, and the World War I. He was a machine-gunner, and sp-spent four years in \u2014 in the army. He survived without any injury, but he did suffer from dysentery and almost died, but survived, obviously. He fought in both the eastern part, that is in the Russian sector, as well as the western front. And he was a very  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection ; Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 patriotic German, and was highly decorated the end of the war, for his achievements."

Every battle that\u2019s the unit that he was in, participated in, was identified. And I was able to put all this on a map one day, and I saw that he indeed fought on all fronts.

And he was in uniform. And I only assume that the occupation, at least in that part  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection ; Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 of the world, was quite peaceful. So\u2019s he \u2014 no one seemed to mind that he was in uniform. He went to Jewish services on Friday night, and at the end of the service, an elderly man came up to him and invited him to come to dinner at his home, which was [indecipherable] I guess, for Jewish soldiers, when they go to services. There he met a young girl. He was born in 18 na \u2014 1889, and my mother was born eight \u2014 no, he was born \u2014 and my mother was born in 1898."

The war years are a f\u2014 World War I, that is, were not in any of his letters. But there was a postcard which he had sent to his then sweetheart, in Tallinn, probably from Berlin, which he bemoans the fact that he is all alone. And he drew a picture of an umbrella standing and leaning against the fence of the house that apparently they lived in. And he is as lonely as the umbrella.

My English by this time must have been good enough to ask for \u2014 a few questions. And so I ask him where he was from, and he said to me, D.C. And I said, what\u2019s the city called? He said, D.C. I said, where is it? D.C. And by this time I walked away from him, because I didn\u2019t figure he had it all, I mean. And of course, that\u2019s where we ended up, in D.C.

I mean, I \u2014 I have \u2014 I have the philosophy that people are people, and that you can take any group of people, and make anything you want out of them, if you have the right tools for it. And Goebbels was actually the master of that genre. He was able to persuade the German people that there was indeed a danger, that Jews had to be eliminated, and most Germans seemed to believe that. And unfortunately, you could do that anywhere. I mean, you \u2014 we\u2019ve seen this every day in our own history, and we see it today in \u2014 1n \u2014 in o \u2014 our efforts overseas, to create some kind of order. People can be made to believe anything. We are a very unfinished specie of animal. We still have a long ways to go."

Are there other things that you think people need to understand about the Holocaust aspect, and about what came later?",
            "answer": "The Holocaust is simply an example of how easy it is to mislead people into believing something. I mean, I must give credit to Goebbels, he did this with a  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 1 Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 tactful \u2014 with a \u2014 with a tactics that were exceedingly professional. He made people believe the Jews were no longer human beings. That you could do anything you want to with them, because they were not like us. They had different blood, they had different \u2014 you \u2014 you see upstairs, when you go through the mi \u2014 exhibits, they measured heads of people to show how different our Aryans are from say non- Aryans. Certainly different from people of different colors. You could measure that, you can | \u2014 you can look at that from various aspects, and sure enough, they\u2019re not the same people as pure blooded Aryans. And that was believed. This blood theory went a long way towards making Germans believe that they are supermen, that they had some powers other do not have. They deserve what was coming to them, one way or another. Today Germany has probably the most progressive education on the Holocaust. I mean, I was in Berlin, went to the Jewish museum, and they had exhibited pictures of department stores which belonged to Jews. And most of the big department stores were owned by Jews. And the people were surprised, you know, they had no idea that this was actually the case. The museum also had to teach the German people what Jews were. All of a sudden, you walk in, the first \u2014 and they change exhibits periodically, but when I went there for the first time, first thing you came across was the mikveh, to show people what ritual bath was like, why it was there. And then from there and so progressingly, here\u2019s what Judaism\u2019s  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 113 Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 all about. And it\u2019s being taught. I\u2019ve seen their schoolbooks, their curriculums, and they are very careful to teach this, the Holocaust. So you can turn people from one direction to another."

            "answer": "I\u2014I\u2019m not very good about the idea of changing people, or that people are changeable. People are born with certain ideas, principles, and conduct, which is theirs for life. And I\u2019m always surprised at people being able to move from one religion to another, or act in various capacities that they would normally not act. But I do believe that the Jews kind of formed very early in life, and that you stick with those ways because they seem comfortable to you, and you feel secure in that environment."
