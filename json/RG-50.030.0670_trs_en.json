And when this man, who Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 56 became a policeman \u0152 but throughout the Nazi period, they would still have these annual meetings. At one point, when Jews were required to put on the star, the guy said to him, you know what? You better come see me in my office.

A nd throughout the war, he was able to do that periodically, so that he would always be able to move somewhere else, find a place to live, work somewhere.

And the rabbi immediately hastened to the site, and stood there while the firemen, who were carefully hosing down all the buildings nearby, so that they would not catch on fire, but left the synagogue burning. It burned into a sh ell. The walls were still standing, but everything else was gone.

Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 58 Martin Swa rzenski , the rabbi was one of the great rabbis of the Jewish community.

            "answer": "The Holocaust is simply an example of how easy it is to mislead people into believing something. I mean, I must give credit to Goebbels , he did this with a Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 112 tactful \u0152 with a \u0152 with a tactics that were exceedingly professional. He made people believe the Jews were no longer human beings. That you could do anything you want to with them, because they were not like us. They had different blood, they had different \u0152 you \u0152 you see upstairs, when you go through the mi \u0152 exhibits, they measured heads of people to show how different our Aryans are from say nonAryans. Certainly different from people of different colors. You could measure that, you can l \u0152 you can look at that from various aspects, and sure enough, they\u2122re not the same people as pure blooded Aryans. And that was believed. This blood theory went a long way towards making Germans believe that they are supermen, that they had some powers other do not have. They deserve what was coming to them, one way or another. Today Germany has probably the most progressive education on the Holocaust. I mean, I was in Berlin , went to the Jewish museum, and they had exhibited pictures of department stores which belonged to Jews. And most of the big department stores were owned by Jews. And the people were surprised, you know, they had no idea that this was actually the case. The museum also had to teach the German people what Jews were. All of a sudden, you walk in, the first \u0152 and they change exhibits periodically, but when I went there for the first time, first thing you came across was the mikveh , to show people what ritual bath was like, why it was there. And then from there and so progressingly , here\u2122s what Judaism\u2122s Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 113 all about. And it\u2122s being taught.
