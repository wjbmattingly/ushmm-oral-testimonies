And when this man, who <6 Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 became a policeman \u2014 but throughout the Nazi period, they would still have these annual meetings. At one point, when Jews were required to put on the star, the guy said to him, you know what? You better come see me in my office. And George went to see him, and from that point on, this guy gave him identification papers of some other name. And throughout the war, he was able to do that periodically, so that he would always be able to move somewhere else, find a place to live, work somewhere. And he was able to get his food stamps, which are needed, and a passport, through this police officer, who by this time became a senior police officer in the German police forces. His wife went \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure exactly what the situation was, but he and \u2014 she and the daughter went to some family on the farm somewhere, and hid, were in hiding, in fact.

And the rabbi immediately hastened to the site, and stood there while the firemen, who were carefully hosing down all the buildings nearby, so that they would not catch on fire, but left the synagogue burning. It burned into a shell. The walls were still standing, but everything else was gone.

It was a very sad experience. <8 Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 Martin Swarzenski, the rabbi was one of the great rabbis of the Jewish community. The Jewish community, by the way, in Germany, I think to this day, rabbis and church officials are government employees, they get paid by the government, so the community doesn\u2019t ever have to worry about paying for their ministers. But h-he was a dedicated rabbi. He was a very courageous man. He insisted on staying be \u2014 though he had an opportunity to leave, until they finally arrested him, put him in a concentration camp, and because he had a visa or permit to leave Germany, he was eventually let go. He became a rabbi in the United States, in Madison, Wisconsin. While I was working here at the museum, as a visitor service, a man started talking to me about his community in Madison, Wisconsin. And he said he was a member of one of those fraternal brotherhoods, which had an annual dedication, or ceremony when Swarzenski died. He was there the rabbi \u2014 this man was not Jewish.

I mean, I must give credit to Goebbels, he did this with a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 1 Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 tactful \u2014 with a \u2014 with a tactics that were exceedingly professional. He made people believe the Jews were no longer human beings. That you could do anything you want to with them, because they were not like us. They had different blood, they had different \u2014 you \u2014 you see upstairs, when you go through the mi \u2014 exhibits, they measured heads of people to show how different our Aryans are from say non- Aryans. Certainly different from people of different colors. You could measure that, you can | \u2014 you can look at that from various aspects, and sure enough, they\u2019re not the same people as pure blooded Aryans. And that was believed. This blood theory went a long way towards making Germans believe that they are supermen, that they had some powers other do not have. They deserve what was coming to them, one way or another. Today Germany has probably the most progressive education on the Holocaust. I mean, I was in Berlin, went to the Jewish museum, and they had exhibited pictures of department stores which belonged to Jews. And most of the big department stores were owned by Jews. And the people were surprised, you know, they had no idea that this was actually the case. The museum also had to teach the German people what Jews were. All of a sudden, you walk in, the first \u2014 and they change exhibits periodically, but when I went there for the first time, first thing you came across was the mikveh, to show people what ritual bath was like, why it was there. And then from there and so progressingly, here\u2019s what Judaism\u2019s 113 Interview with Gerald Liebenau September 12, 2012 all about. And it\u2019s being taught. I\u2019ve seen their schoolbooks, their curriculums, and they are very careful to teach this, the Holocaust. So you can turn people from one direction to another."

            "answer": "I\u2014I\u2019m not very good about the idea of changing people, or that people are changeable. People are born with certain ideas, principles, and conduct, which is theirs for life. And I\u2019m always surprised at people being able to move from one religion to another, or act in various capacities that they would normally not act. But I do believe that the Jews kind of formed very early in life, and that you stick with those ways because they seem comfortable to you, and you feel secure in that environment."
