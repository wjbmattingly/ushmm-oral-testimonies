            "answer": "Occupied? I was only - I have to tell you the story and I was in the army. Before... If you want to hear the story about - because l939, September the first, the Germans took over Poland - start... You know I was on the border. I wasn't home. I was in the army - not far from Zakopana - where I use to be in the army. We fought with the Germans until Lvov near from Lvov, but they were very t ough. The Polish army were - took apart - they have nothing. Horses there. We were running from the Germ ans. I fought with them a few times, but mostly we were running. I wasn't home when they start to occupy Poland. And until September the twenty-fourt h, I was in the woods over there before Lvov over there - you know - you hear from Lvov. And I have to - the Germans took us - said they're going to bomb the woods over ther e if we don't give up. So the Polish Army give up. I have to give my rifle away. They took us to prison. They took us to prison. We were in a big stadium - in a stadium - they call Javorno(?). Because the Germans and the Russian were friends. Stalin made a pact wi th Hitler. They cut in half Poland. So we were on the side from the Russian side. So th ey ask us - fifty people wants to go to work to take the ammunition - you know, in the trucks - they go back on the other side when the Germans took it over. So... I have a hard time over there. One sergeant that was over there - a river - told me to wash his hor se. He got boots until in the water - I in the shoes. He didn't know I'm Jewish but this time he start washing. I never in my life washed a horse. He give me a brush. He came over and said, \"You Polak, you swine.\" He kicked me in the lower back. Until today - hurts me until today. Okay - let me go later take a bus - some food to eat and send us back to the stadium. You want to know how I escape, right? In the stadium they sa id, \"you're going to go to Krakow.\" You hear from Krakow. Schindler was over there. The bus from Lvov to Krakow - we 01:21:00 took a train. We took a train to Krakow and the people were living in the - you know, in the villages and the cities - were jumping in the train. They're shooting after them. You know, they were on the roofs - the Germans on the roofs. They start to escape who was living, you know, close to Krakow, or they jump from the train. I didn't escape yet. We 10 came - we came.... You want to go to Krakow we can't get in because it was closed you know. The station, a red light was over there. We can't get in. There was on the train station over there. We stop in Plaszow-Krakow . It was a concentration camp, later I find out. But they want us take to Krakow. They stopped in the train station because he can't get in. It was red lights over there. That was about 4 o'cl ock, 5 o'clock in the 01:22:00 evening. And a German soldier was sitting lik e you sit over there, with a rifle - and my car, you know from the train, was I saw him. So I ask him, I can go down - step down, a little bit of air - because this was a cattl e train. There was another Polak soldier over there was from my home town. So I start talking to those two Polish girls - about twenties they were. They said to me in Polish, \"You better escape from here because if they take you Krakow, in concentration camps, you gonna die over there. The lice gonna eat you over there.\" So I said to them, \"No, we were lucky. We are staying over there until it gets dark. You bring with you (this was a village) those shawls...\" Those shawls - you know - women' shawls - a big sh awl.... \"with you.\" They said okay. So they left. And I know German. I use to go in the school where I live in ?-- . So I start talking to the German soldier. Oh, I can go drink water that was over there - a water fountain. \"Von wo kennen Sie Deutsch,\" he ask me. Why I can German? I said, \"Ich bin von Kattowitz\". Kattowitz used to be belong, I told you, until 1918, was Germany. \"Oh,\" he said, \"you are comrade.\" You know what comrade is? \"Oh, you my friend, Sie werden bald entlassen.\" He told me that, \"You'll go free quick because you're a German - use to be German over there.\" I ask him once - I can go drink water - twice. He told me, \"Ja, Sie brauchen doch garnicht fragen.\" I don't have to ask anymore. \"You go when you want.\" So I went with my friend - drink water. We were still over there and it was dark already. So I went - drink water. I saw the 01:24:00 girls over there with the shawls. When they gave me the sh awls I throw away my soldier coat with my hat and we went to the village over there. They didn't know I'm Jewish. I was a corporal. Very seldom in Poland they have a corporal, an officer has to be very educated; Begin 11 was an officer. You know Begin - used to be the Prime Minister. He was in the same Polish Army. So I went out in the village. So I changed clothes with a man over there. He gave me a old hat with a jacket - a shor t pants. Not shaved, I looked like a poor man. And they feed us a little bit. I have about 100 kilometers - th is is about seventy miles - to home. It was a straight road. And that Po lak, the other friend, had money. He bought a bicycle. He left. I didn't have money on me , but I had two, three dollars. So they told me, you know what.... They wanted my shoes too. I said, \"No. This is soldiers shoes. I have to walk.\" They told me, \"Take the streetcar and go about twenty kilometers - you have farther to your hometown.\" So I took the streetcar and I stepped down after the streetcar - I had about (how much?) - still I had about fo rty miles to go 01:26:00 home. There was two little cities over there. They're called Cherbina. There was another city, Charnov after this. Cherbina - between Cherbina, Charnov when they took over Poland - the Germans - said this will be Germany un til - Charnov. Cherbina with Krakow, this will be occupied - they call occupied. So between those two cities, I wake up in the morning I have still forty, fifty Kilometers to walk. I woke up in the morning, I want to walk. I saw over there two SS people - you know, two SS. It was not a - really a border, but they were standing over there. I had no documents. I was afraid. All of a sudden a Polish guy on a bicycle, he passed the border. So they started yelling after them. They took their bicycles and run after him. I was lu cky - very lucky. So I started walking. All of a sudden I see a horse with a wagon - you know, an open wagon - how you call the platform wagon. Not - not in the sides. I saw my uncle with a friend and two women on the platform. I saw my uncle. I say, \" hold it. Who are you poor man, Who are you?\" They didn't recognize me. \"Who are you?\" I said, \"I'm Berek.\" I took off my hat. Almost fainted because it was on the 26th of September Germany took over everywhere. They thought home that I'm 01:28:00 dead already. I was in the war. They said, \"You know what. Step up on the wagon. We go. I buy appl es over there - all kinds of things.\" I said, \"No, I'm not going with you over there. The SS over there. Don't go over there,\" I 12 told him. \"Don't go.\" He gives me five dolla rs and I went later to a bakery and I bought something. Was not bread but I pay more money. You know - everything was black market. I was not hungry anymore. I started walking home. I lived on a street - I guess it was the corner. I lived here - and I came over here. A nd at that corner I had about two more blocks to go. At the corner I saw my aunt. We live together; not the same apartment but right on the same... with a frie nd. I said, \"Tante Chaya\", you know what a Tante is? And she said, \"Who are you?\" I wa s not shaved - old hat, and she fainted... she fainted. So, go 01:29:30 quick home. It was about 5 o'clock in the evening. Where I use to live there was a big house - sixty... was sixty apartments. Not condominiums; apartments - rent. In the house in Poland wa s like this. They would have a gate - in every house a gate you can't get in after 10 o' clock in the evening. You know, over there, a Polish guy (Doorman)- you know the st reets, a . So I went over there. He wanted to see me because I escaped from the Germans. So I knock on the door and where the maid... She opened the door and I put my foot in between. I said, \"Can I talk to Mr. Dafner?\" She said, \"Mr. Dafner... They were eating dinner... A poor man asks for you.\" I didn't know the maid. But my mother recognized my voice. [pause]"

Everybody knew me. knew me. You 13 know, goyim, the gentiles, knew me. We won't let you go . All four, they brought maybe a half a loaf of bread. So next time I went. Everybody knew me over there. Always the people would stay in the line, you know. But I do it too - two loaves of breads in half an hour. I didn't stand in line. I saw what's going on later. My father said to me like this, \"Go in the Jewish Commun ity Center. Sign over there so you get - a piece of bread - you know - you get over there rations.\" I said, \"I don't wanna go. I escaped from the Germans over there. I'm af raid.\" He was afraid not to go, so I went over there. I talked to the main man over ther e. His name was Mottel Marrin. They told me later the Germans killed him. He was no good to the Jewish people later. And I went to him, \"Listen, I was in the army eighteen months and I escaped from the prison. Don't send me to work because I saw my friends sw eeping the streets.\" The Jewish people... the Germans... \"Don't send me over there.\" It was about two months. All of a sudden they send me a paper to go sw eep the street. I said, \"uh, uh.\" I wouldn't go. But hear over the radio home, the Russian side, the Je wish people over there singing Jewish. I said, \"I have to escape to the Russian side.\" A lot of people were escaping because they have many Jewish people alive now on the Ru ssian side. My mother was crying, \"You just came back from the army.\" I said, \"I 'm not going to stay with what's going on.\" I went to the street and told the Jewish people not to walk on the sidewalk or in the street. They beat up girls over there. They didn't care the young - Hitler jung they call - you know, those young. When they sent me the paper after two mont hs it was already, I think, November. It was colder over there - snow. I said to my father, \"I'm going the other side - the border.\" So he put in money over here.... and I took shoes and clothes - how you call when your carrying in the school... the schoolchildren are wearing those.... a backpack? And I took saccharin with me. It was very expensive this stuff. I took two kilos, two packages. It was very cheap - 100 Zlotys, that's all. I knew. Somebody told me on the other side, the Russian side, you could get a lot of mone y for it. So, all of a sudden came over before I escaped, my aunt with a child from France. She said she 14 wants to go over the border. She wants to go. She knows a gentile over there - how to cross - there was a river there. They have a little boat. You pay them money. So I went all day long - - I have to hide. I hid in a basement some where. In the evening I went to another city. I went to the border with my aunt - over the border. The Polak took us. We paid him a hundred zlotys (?)dollars. We come the other side, the Russian caught us. Put us in jail. The women separate. My aunt I never saw anymore. There were seventy people in a room - a little bigger - like my dining room. Seventy people who couldn't lay down on the floor - even sleep - si tting all night. I was over there ten days. They let us go."

Very cheap food was over there - ten dollars was a kilo of bread. Over here it was a hundred eighty. We have to go to work. Me and my friend - he wa s from Warsaw - they give us a horse with a wagon. What we have to do? He said to bring bricks - to build houses - five times a day - bring from the factory over there. One of our friends he was the a foreman. They made him a foreman. Took over to write down how many bricks I brought, what I brought. Everything for the buildings what they built over there - some houses. There was all kind things over there. So we brought over until five times, bricks. Five wagons - We wrote three times. He wrote it down that we brought five. It was over there millions of bricks. They didn't know over ther e - the big shots - they didn't know. It's going on in Russia like this. Everything was a lie. The rest of the time we went to the.... People coming in from Ukraine, you know they escape from the war, so we went over there to the sea. We make some money on the packages - you know, when they brought 28 it over - from the people. I forgot to tell you something from Siberia. How is Russian - is working over there. They Took us one time about one hundred people to walk over - take out potatoes from the ground. They didn't have machines to take out the potato - with their hands. They told us two people have to make five sacks in eight hours potatoes. Nobody could make this. You can make a lot if you make two of them. My ration guy told us, \"You see over there? Millions of potatoes with sacks over there. Make two and take from over there three.\" So we did - everybody from the hundred people - took from there three sacks. Was m illions over there - sacks of them. When we finished work, the foreman came over and marked that we did 100% work. And we... They put it back on that pile of sacks over there. So, this is the story how the whole was a lie. We left, other people coming over and did the same thing. Everything goes in the paper. There is nothing, never."

A woman was yelling, \"My husband died.\" \"So, what do you want from me?\" \"C an you bury him?\" My friend says - he was 6'2\", 250 pound my friend - \"Let's bury him. Make some money.\" So we took him over there. We bury him - not too deep. Make mayb e two feet - make a hol e two feet - a little sand over there on top. We make more money in two hours more than I work in a half a year. We 03:12 did everything. And th is was in 1943. All of a sudden the Russians send us a paper. We have to take Russian pa ssport. I had a paper from Siberia I told you - with a paragraph I'm a Polish citizen. So we were standing in line - a Polak. A Gentile was standing before me. The KGB ask him questions: You want to take a Russian passport? He said, \"No. I'm a Polish citize n.\" He say, \"You eat Russian bread, you have to take.\" This is the only country in the world where they force you to take a passport. In America you have to wait six years to have passport. He said, \"No.\" They took him away. So I said, ah, ah. They ask me. I was in the line. \"You take a Russian passport?\" \"Sure.\" Okay, so I went to the other door. There was over there a young lady. I knew her. You want Russian pass? I say, \"Yes.\" For how many years? For five years - or six months, a temporary?\" I say, \"I take a temporary.\" They t ook away my paper. We knew each other. There was five thousand people. They were dancing over there..., they were.... Then she asks me, I believe in God. I say, \"Yes.\" Where's God ? Let's not talk about it. She didn't believe in God. You know, the Communists. Later they took us away to send us to work. It is cold again. This called Ural Mountains. You hear from this? The City was Ufa. And we went to work over there. They said... There's a factory over there. If you want to hear another lie what's going on over there. We went over there to work. They make soda soda - some kind of powder for the airplanes. They said so. I was working electrician over ther e. The people were there - was Uzbekistan you know - those Arabs. They live over there, all their life in a warm climate. Come over. It was cold over there.

            "question": "So this was probably your first realization of what had been happening while you were in Russia.",
            "answer": "Ya. Because I didn't know. I was far away - t housands, thousands of kilometers. I knew they were bad over there. There was rumors ove r there - killing people. You understand they did anything they wanted to come in the city. The soldiers said, \"It's not our fault. The Captain said to do it.\" They took away everyt hing what they could and they sent it to Germany. When I was in Germany and my wife bought it over there - to light a candle - candlelights [candelabra] fr om silver - and the Germans stole... with the Jewish, you know, over there. They came over. They took everything from the house - everything. They can say war. It was very tough. When you caught them they were so afraid. I was surprised. When you caught a prisoner over there they were so afraid terrible because they knew what they did to everybody. It was terrible. I can tell you after this I came home if you wanna know - in March - and the German s start to escape. The Russians were after... the Polish army the Russian went. They started running - like we were running in 1939. I came home in Ma rch with the train. I was standing about 41 twenty kilometers from Wars aw. In Warsaw there was no one house left. They bombed everything over there, the Germans. 04:10 The whole city. I went home. I came home to the same house. There lived only gentiles over there. Everywhere. So I asked the janitor. I saw he was sweeping the floor - was the street. I asked him, \"Where you live?\" He use to live in basement. He say, \"Ove r there.\" There was a house - maybe four or five rooms. A rabbi use to live in it - a ri ch rabbi. They have over those Hassidim. You know Hassidim there. He taught... No - home less Russian. I went over there. I knock on the door. I was in soldier clothes - you know, of corporal. \"Who is it?\" she ask me. It was 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the morning. I say, \"Polish soldier.\" She opened the door. She didn't recognize me. \"Who are you? What do you want?\" I took off my hat. \"Nobody lives from your family.\" \"Who is livin g in my house?\" \"Gentiles.\" \"Don't go over there,\" she said. \"Why shouldn't go over th ere?\" They took away. They took away my father, my mother, everything. She gave me tea. I came over there about 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock over there. I knock on the door. A women over there - Polak. She had a child maybe ten, twelve years. I say, \"Can I go in?\" She said, \"Yes .\" She look - \"Corporal.\" She didn't know I'm Jewish. I look. ? . ? Can I go in there - bedroom, dining room. She said, \"Why not. Look ar ound.\" She said, \"What you looking for?\" I said, \"I use to live over here.\" \"But the Jewish people use to live over there.\" Said, \"I'm Jewish.\" I look around again. She said, \"Wha t are you looking for, gold?\" \"No.\" The Polaks, they always thought the Jewish had.... I was so frustrated. I had my gun with me, you know. I took her by the hair and I knoc k her down. It was concrete steps. I throw her on..... I didn't know what to do - else . I would kill her. I didn't find nobody in there. She ask me if I'm looking for gold. And the other gentiles running around. \"Mr. Corporal, what happened?\" So, I left. I was so angry - Terrible. I went to the community center - the Jewish community center - to find somebody. They told me over 04:13:30 there, \"There's much people still in concentration camp.\" But my cousin was free already. Of course he was in Poland - in concentration camps - not far from 42 Warsaw. He barely walk around. He lives now in Chicago. They told me nobody - nobody. So I left a note over there in the Jewish community center that I'm in the army - twenty kilometers from Warsaw . When the war ended my sisters were in concentration camp. One was in Czechoslovakia and one was - still was Germany - but the Polish army later took it over - a big piece from Germany. Sile sia that is called. And I went back to the army over there. After the war - fini shed May 5th. About in a week or two somebody told me that some young woman waiting for me outside. [Obvious crying]. Was my sister. She lives in Israel. So I got two days off. Later she left. She was working in - with my younger sister - in... Sh e knew German, so she work in office over there - a Jewish community center. There was occupied by Poland now - they took over a big piece from Silesia - from the Germans. So, I came over there. That's where I meet my wife. So I went to the Kattowitz. She use to live in 04:16 Kattowitz. So over there I took a train. There were three cars - soldier cars. And the rest were a train - you know - the civilian people. And this lady over there, my wife, I don't know... She had packages - all kind packages. And she wants to go in the train where the soldiers are. I didn't know she's Jewish. I told her, \"Get down.\" Thought she's a shiksa. I was made on the gentiles, you know. They help out the Germans. Why the Germans made those concentration camps - death camps - in Poland? They knew they had good friends because they were big anti-Semites - you know - the Polaks. So she said she can in the civilian train because a lot of people are over there. I thought she is not Jewish. I didn't let - everyone was wounded soldiers still over there. But later I found out - a friend - another young lady - came over... A big nose with black hair. So I met my wife. So she went over there, for a wedding over there, where my sister was working in Silesia, you know. She invite me to the wedding. I tooked all of her packages for she made business. She had... You know what kind of business? Yeast - you know yeast when you baking bread... Those big packages. She was a business lady, so everything was black market. So I came over in the city. She sold it - ev erything. Make a lot of money. And she ask 43 me - I went to the wedding - if I... She want to buy clothes over there; shirts and pants back to sell it where she lives in the city Kattowitz. I said, \"Young lady,\" I said, \"If you need me I have to take it over all packages\" because the police would arrest her. It was not allowed to make business over there with the Russians. So, she give me 500 Zlotys. It's not worth much money. I have to buy for my young sister a pair of shoes. I'll take it. She said, \"Ya, sure.\" She give me 500 Zlotys. I give my sister to buy a pair of shoes. She's living in Florida. I remind always her. She doesn't remember. So we went to the wedding and I took it over - all packages. She make quite a few dollars. And I start coming to her every week from Warsaw."

One time I was with them. I don't know - remember - a month or two months or something. One guy he had always a machine gun on him. He was afraid.
