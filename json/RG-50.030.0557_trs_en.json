And so, soon as the Nazis occupied Poland, the Russians moved their borders as well, and consequently we came under Russian occupation."

And I think that\u2019s why it dissipated, because they didn\u2019t really know, didn\u2019t have the hatred, it was something that was passed onto them from \u2014 from their parents or \u2014 or \u2014 you know, from adults, that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s all right to pick on Jews, you know, and that thing.
