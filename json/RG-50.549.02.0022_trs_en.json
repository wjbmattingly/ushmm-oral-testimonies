What -- I mean, were they - | mean, you know, things like was it a religious family or were you -- you know --",
            "answer": "Mm. I think you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t grow up or live in the city of Frankfort, in Germany, without being touched by religion. There were -- of course the city had undergone all these movements of -- when the reform movement started, they went to that one extreme and then they went to an -- the other extreme and throughout reform movement and -- but generally, a-around 1850 or so, Rabbi Samson Raffelhirsch be -- came to Frankfort. He was Orthodox and there was an -- a t-tone of Orthodoxy all throughout the city. The stores were -- Jewish stores were closed on Shabbas, except for two department stores that were owned by Jews, but they -- they -- they were open. And most people kept kosher. My school was not the real -- Samson Raffelhirsch religious school, it was a school that had been opened in 1804 by a secretary of one of the Rothchild\u2019s. They had seen to a Yeshiva Baharim and walking around and they f -- and Rothchild felt they should have a -- a secular -- or any kind of education. So he commissioned his secretary to start a school for -- for them and out of this grew a school that was called Filantropine, which was -- because of it\u2019s beginning was -- had the -- had a philanthropic connotation, but by the time when my brother and I went, my father was joking that it cost him as much for our education as a -- what a German workman would earn per month. Well, not quite, but, you know, something like that. So this school really- also [indecipherable] Samson Raffelhirsch school, they were always Orthodox and there was no question about it. This school, when -- when -- it had started experimenting with Sunday schooling and with Saturday schooling. They didn\u2019t write on Shabbat, but they ha -- they had school on Shabbat. And then they gave that up again. By the time we went -- this went on through the century. By the time we went to school, it was fairly -- well, the people who went were -- who went there were -- not the very Orthodox. So my parents kept kosher and we kept Shabbat, we kept Eviomtop, but we didn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t as the other school. Now, but I remember we were 43 children in the beginning and I -- I don\u2019t know -- I think one confessed that she didn\u2019t -- that that family didn\u2019t keep kosher, and everybody else did. So, if -- if that answers your question -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s enough. I mean we -- my parents belonged to a synagogue that was burned down in 1938 in the Kristallnacht, that would be considered, probably Conservative by today\u2019s standards, even though it was different. There was still the mareetzah, with women upstairs and men downstairs and other things, but it -- but it -- and it didn\u2019t have a -- an organ like the Reform synagogue -- that one Reform synagogue that\u2019s still standing in Frankfort now, but it -- it was a little less str-strict than the Samson Rafellhirsch\u2019s sh -- synagogue."

Sometimes I wish they would have looked more to the outside and would have wanted to leave and -- you know, and argue, I don\u2019t want to be here any more. One of them should have said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here any more and let\u2019s get out.\u201d But they didn\u2019t and I can\u2019t -- I\u2019m still trying to puzzle this out.

They didn\u2019t -- and they were very supportive of each other. It\u2019s not that they lived side by side, but that they were really -- 1t was really a very close relationship."

            "answer": "Well, you know, first of all, everybody wanted to go to the United States. People were talking about not going -- not wanting to -- well, of course, many people went for Eur -- to European countries -- other European countries and of course, they were invaded there. I mean, Holland and Belgium and France and of course, the people who were sent to Poland in 1938, that the -- this expulsion of the Polish Jews, that brought on Kristallnacht, ostensibly, becau -- that\u2019s what the Nazis said. But they -- they were all destroyed, so there was really no -- no real point to -- of course we didn\u2019t know this at the time. Everyone always said, \u201cOh, look at this crazy man. Look at him in the -- 1n the newsreels, pounding the table and screaming away at --\u201d I mean, this has to end -- this can\u2019t keep going. Of course, it ended, but 12 years too late. So one of the things I f -- my father -- I felt my -- with my father, was j -- he -- my famil -- my father\u2019s family originated in the medieval Frankfort ghetto. And then, when all these things with the Reform and the Orthodox happened, the fa -- this branch of the family got tired of it and they moved to Bratislava and they became well known rabbis, the Sofa family. As a matter of fact, we had a megillah that was given -- made by the Sofas to -- for my grandfather\u2019s wedding. And it was given to him as a gift, my grandfather had it with him, my father had it. When my uncle went to Israel, my Uncle Abba, in 1936, he wanted to take it with him and my father said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s got to stay with the oldest brother.\u201d And of course it was destroyed. Otherwise that beautiful thing would have been now in Israel or perhaps with me or in a museum or somewhere. So, my parent -- my father reali -- my father kept his Czechoslovak passport, because for business, when he traveled, the Czechoslovak passport was accepted everywhere. Czechoslovakia was at the time the only republic in Europe. They were highly respected and their passport was accepted everywhere and he relied on that to be able to get us out of Germany, which ultimately didn\u2019t work. But -- so he, in traveling, h-he was comfortable thinking that, well, he hears from everybody that the Nazis would stop -- of course later on the -- this -- he couldn\u2019t go any more. This was just in the very beginning. But he heard that well, the Nazis, I mean, who\u2019d look at this nonsense, this is going to stop soon. And I think that\u2019s why they sat. And people started going to S-South America and they wrote back such terrible reports. They couldn\u2019t wait to get back again and things like that, so I guess they didn\u2019t want to subject us to this."

My father relied on his passport and we made our way to the French border. The borders were closed, they wouldn\u2019t let us in. We had to sleep in a farmhouse overnight and then the next day we went back to Frankfort. I\u2019ve heard of people who followed that same route, but they were adults and they swam across the river -- a river -- illegally and made their way into France. Now, my parents couldn\u2019t have done this in [phone ringing] Sorry. What\u2019s the next question?"

And he remembers me as being very shy and laid back. But what I remember was that I was not happy in school. I was the youngest, I was the smallest and I just -- I was just not happy. Even though this was a wonderful school and I mean, I remember the -- the little bit of Greek that we learned and the Latin that -- this was an outstanding school and it was the best school in -- in Europe, I think. And whatever math I would know, I remember from -- from the Filantropine. But -- so, that was me, what -- I was shy, I was always afraid. And I -- I think I still am.

If a chair was moved upstair -- you know, he could hear it downstairs, so he\u2019d take a -- whatever it was, a broom or something and hit the ceiling because we were making too much noise. It was a real -- you know, so it -- it was awful. And Sunday mornings, there were always these lectures on -- the speeches by Hitler. You went outside, everything was quiet. The church bells -- bells were going on one side and Hitler\u2019s voice was coming from every radi -- everybody wanted to show how good a Nazi he was, so they turned on the radios, you know, loud, so everybody could sh -- hear, and then what -- for whatever -- I guess that was the reason. And, so you could hear him talking from one end to another and it is scary. Of course, to me, just the voice was scary, the contents I didn\u2019t understand, but the voice and -- and this whole ambiance was scary. We couldn\u2019t go swimming any more, because we were told there were at-attempts at drowning. We had gone swimming in a public park, in a pond. Whe -- a -- all Jewish people, unless they went on vacation, in a -- but the ones who stayed in the city for any time went swimming there. Then the public -- there were public baths and you couldn\u2019t go swimming there in - th-they were closed to Jews, but the other you co -- in the park, for instance, you couldn\u2019t go because there were attempts of drownings, so of course we didn\u2019t go any more. And people moved from the small towns -- Jews moved from the small towns to p- fi -- to Frankfort because they felt a little bit safer in the -- in a crowd. So people came an -- into the school -- new students came in. Other students left for wherever they were going. It was -- and the same thing with teachers. So, they were always coming and going and it was -- it was not a very settled situation. However, as I said I was reading and I -- we tried to -- I guess our parents tried as to live as normal a life, but I guess I didn\u2019t know any different, because I grew up with all that, so I just went along."

If they\u2019d go to the police station, they -- my parents would be arrested or who knows what Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection they would do to us? So you couldn\u2019t because you know, we -- my husband and my -- our sons, went back to Frankfort probably about 20 years ago. I didn\u2019t want to go, but my husband had business there and he said, \u201cOh we should go to the Jewish places,\u201d and that\u2019s what -- actually what we did. So we went to the -- a -- from where we lived, just -- was about a long block to the school, block and a half. And on the way was -- one of the houses that had not been damaged, or had been repaired, it wasn\u2019t pulled down completely. And I recognized it and I told them a story. There was a little girl, who went to school with my brother. Because they were walking home on the same way and he -- he just had a few more houses to -- further to go, we -- I started teasing him that this was his girlfriend and he didn\u2019t like it, but whatever. The father had suddenly done something that the Nazis didn\u2019t like. They didn\u2019t punish him, but they took this little girl and they had her sterilized and returned to the parents. And when you hear these things -- I mean, my -- I -- my parents, you know, it was very difficult, they didn\u2019t say anything, because you didn\u2019t want to tell children so much. Number one, they would be very frightened, but number two, if they talked, it was dangerous. So it was best if children knew as little as possible. But this particular incident, I guess the -- we were talking about all the ti -- they were tal -- not all the time, but they were talking about it, because it just couldn\u2019t be hidden. So, can you imagine how this poor father felt, that they did this to his daughter? It\u2019s a little girl, I mean just maybe nine years old. I didn\u2019t even know -- I don\u2019t even know if they -- what they could have done to -- but whatever it was, that 1s -- that\u2019s what we heard. So you had this kind of fear all the time that you couldn\u2019t talk, you couldn\u2019t be loud. You couldn\u2019t be -- God forbid, obnoxious in the street or something, you know, because people -- there was always a Nazi waiting in -- in someplace waiting for you, you know?"

We traveled during the day and we stopped at night, because they didn\u2019t want the trains to be bombed and the Royal Air Force was, at that time, only -- mostly bombing at night. Later on they -- when the radar was better or whatever and they -- they were strong there, and the Nazis were -- their guns were already knocked out, they were -- they were bombing during the day. So, at that time, we -- we were moving, that\u2019s why this -- these few hundred miles from Frankfort to Auschwitz took seven days to get us to. Well, what happened then, as I said before, they had -- the na -- the -- Hitler was losing, the Nazis were losing 1-in -- militarily, so for his birthday, on the 19th of April -- the 20th of April was Hitler\u2019s birthday, on the 19th they made him a present that Germany would be Judenrein and they packed us on the train on the 19th and sent us off to Auschwitz. Well, on the way, we picked up Polish non -- non-Jewish slave laborers, who might have complained, probably that the food wasn\u2019t good, or that they were working too hard, or whatever and instead of a slave labor camp, they were now sent to Auschwitz. But when we arrived, they were separated from us and we were just the 37 of us and the men -- we -- I never saw my father again. So, the men were in one way -- so we were probably -- maybe 15 or so Jews, two children, my brother and a-another young boy. And I was not considered a young -- a -- a-- achild any more, because I could pass as a woman. I was 13, so I could pass, looking like a woman. I mean, considered how emaciated everybody was there, I probably looked like a big, strong person, you know. But -- so we were brought into the camp, my mother and I and a couple of the other women. My a -- and my brother too. And we were tattooed. Our clothes were taken off and our hair was shaved and the other prisoners introduced us to this wonderful life in -- in Auschwitz. They were telling us what -- there\u2019s the gassing and there\u2019s the selections and everything -- it was like -- but there was so many, it wasn\u2019t that I could get scared, because there was so many new impressions coming in on me, that wer -- I was like -- I was absorbing it, but I couldn\u2019t -- i-1t didn\u2019t sort of synthesize in my mind, but I knew it was happening. So that wh -- among one of the things that they said was that, you know, they wouldn\u2019t take you -- they wouldn\u2019t take you into the gas chambers now, because for a few people, it doesn\u2019t pay to run the gas chamber. So they\u2019Il figure you\u2019ll die or the next time there\u2019s a selection they\u2019ll take you. And that\u2019s actually what it was."

There was a -- the man\u2019s -- the men\u2019s camp and then -- this was actually Birkenau again and one side -- I -- I\u2019m pointing because straight ahead were the crematorium and to the right were -- was the man\u2019s camp. To the left were the two women\u2019s camps. In back of the man\u2019s camp -- camp was a g -- Gypsy lager and now the Gypsy get recognized, unfortunately they don\u2019t -- they aren\u2019t recognized as having suffered as much, but now at least, they speak out. For the longest time, no one remembered. They brought in whole families, put them in the -- into this Gypsy camp, Segonnalager and every few months or so, they emptied out the complete camp, gassed everybody and then brought in more. I don\u2019t know where they found all these people, but it was -- it was a horrible -- I -- I think -- the whole horrible to s -- to think that the whole family -- of course, 1t happened to our people, too, but there 1s was visible to me. And that whole families were just dest -- overnight destroyed. It was -- it was horrible. So this -- but in Auschwitz, people died. When I -- when we walked in, there was a nurse with us, from Romania and it was a beautiful, bright day and the Nazi officer there 1s standing with their boots polished and their pure, white gloves and their uniforms crisp and f -- ironed and we saw a woman being carried on a litter and you could see that she was dead, except that I had never seen a dead person and -- I was 13 years old. So, this nurse said to me, \u201cOh, she\u2019s just sick.\u201d She didn\u2019t want me to be so frightened. So people died at a tremendous rate in Auschwitz. And, when they didn\u2019t die and they were -- they died too slowly, they had the gas chambers, they had these selections and they brought in more people all the time. And the conditions were awful. The f -- we had horrible food. In the morning we had something that was like tea -- I mean, they didn\u2019t even have the color of tea, they called it tea. I think 1t was because it -- it took on the color because the barrels that they carried it in were rusty. So, that\u2019s what -- why it was tea. They gave us something that was like an inch of bread and like a slice that was about an inch thick and it was -- well, the bread probably was healthy because it wasn\u2019t any refined flour. Then they gave us a slice -- oh, probably also about an inch and a half of either liverwurst or salami. And towards the end of my stay in Auschwitz, one time | -- this was in the sum -- in the summer of 1944, when they were killing -- bringing in Hungarian Jews and they were killing them day and night. And I looked out at the crematorium and I saw the smoke going up and I visualized that my piece of salami was human flesh and I couldn\u2019t eat it any more. I -- I -- whenever there was -- whenever I got the salami -- we didn\u2019t get that every day, we got that like two, three times a week or so. Whenever I got it, I tra -- tried to trade it for a piece of bread, because I just couldn\u2019t eat it. And then -- I don\u2019t know -- I -- if we had three meals or two meals, but usually when we came back from work and -- which was in -- in -- the first work we did was digging in a field and they told us to f -- to dig here with this decrepit shovel that was all bent and you couldn\u2019t get anything. And then wi -- after they filled this in, we -- and it was very, very muddy in Auschwitz, there was a thick clay and mud. It was horrible. So they told us to dig here and then they filled this in. And then when there was a hole that we had dug, we had to fill it in again. It was designed to make us lose weight and lose spirit and with the few hundred calories that they gave us, it was a -- you know, th -- every -- people died fr-from malnutrition alone, but there were other things, too.

When she came to Auschwitz, the first thing she wa-wanted to do was she ran to the electric wire, hoping to get -- electrocute herself, or on the way there, with the guards watching this and they would shoot at her and kill her. And my mother ran after her and like -- there was a moat about three feet deep before the electric wire and like a few feet -- and the guard was already ready to shoot, because it was after say lapel in the evening, when you were not allowed to be outside. And my mother was after -- and she pulled her back in. Actually, the woman survived and came to see us once, in Frankfort. So this is -- these are the kinds of things my mother was capable of. While we were in camp -- I wi -- she was a real source of strength to everybody. Once we got out and we got into Frankfort, she was like -- the ho -- all of her collapsed and she was -- I always said that it is a -- it was as though someone had put a giant hand over her trachea and she could inhale enough air to exist, but not to live. And she -- she just -- she -- she looked at this destruction of Frankfort -- we came into Frankfort and th-the city was bombed. I think I could adjust because I was able to say, \u201cOh thank God there isn\u2019t one stone sticking next to the other.\u201d My mother said, when she came in -- she was -- she had a ter -- a terrible fear. Her first impression was that she was just frightened. Now, to me, I was 17, it seemed that my life was ahead. To her, her home was gone, her whole family -- her f -- her husband. So she -- as I said, she just existed, for the next 40 years. She existed, but she didn\u2019t live. She couldn\u2019t enjoy herself, she was very difficult to get along with, with everybody. And she was always dour, she was always depressed and she had a terrible -- I mean, it\u2019s -- she was a real victim of the -- the Holocaust, again."

They left their food in the middle of the table with th -- the -- half eaten and they ran away, because they -- they knew that there were soldiers -- the Russians probably were coming. So we raced -- and we -- we saw the food, but all at once, we were looking for bigger and better and we raced through this storage place and I found something that looked like noodles. So I wanted to take these noodles, we hadn\u2019t had noodles in years. I\u2019m -- my God and what would I do? I -- I was wearing two pairs of underpants. One was the what -- what they gave us, a gray flannel and then, illegally, under it, I was wearing a pink silk that I had found someplace, 1t wasn\u2019t much of anything. And so I kept the pink silk on and I took off the gray flannel, pulled out the string that was holding it on top, tied the legs together and put -- put these noodles into the -- into these pants and walked away with it. And then, for -- we ate whatever we could find. And I must tell you something, again with this -- Gypsies. A whole group of Gypsies were brought to the camp and kept in a separate area. They had walked from I don\u2019t know where, but -- and on the way they found dead horses and they found whatever the -- food they could find and they brought it to camp with them. And do you know, when someone would walk over -- and my mother told me don\u2019t go there. But wh- if someone walked over, they would share the food with everybody. The only thing they did was also that they -- they looked for th -- wood for to make it -- to barbecue the food, you know, roast it a little bit. So they took everything apart. In the end, we couldn\u2019t even go to the toilets any more, because they had taken off the toilet seat -- you know these planks that served as -- to -- as seats, to -- and they -- they burned everything. They took the doors off the -- but, 1t was right, you know, that they did this. Well, anyway, we were given this -- these boxes of food and we were told that we were leaving. And I\u2019m carrying these potatoes -- I-I\u2019m sorry, the noodles with me. And then, on the way, we ran out of food and there was no one to supply us with anything. Every so often, in a field, we would find little potatoes. We didn\u2019t wash them, ba -- there\u2019s no -- no way of washing, w-we -- there was barely a fire. So we ate them ho -- half raw and full of sand and grit a-and we ate it like that. And then finally I said to my mother, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m carrying these noodles and we got to cook them.\u201d Th -- She found a rusted tin can, we found some water from somewhere and we started -- in the fire, we started cooking it. And as we were cooking this, this grew and grew and grew. It didn\u2019t act like noodles, it grew and grew. And what I had cherished right along, while we were eating all these potatoes, I said, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t stand to look at these potatoes.\u201d What I had taken was dehydrated potatoes. So, my grandchildren now tell me, \u201cBut you say you would never eat another potato. And so how come you\u2019re eating potatoes now?\u201d So this is one of the funny -- well, funny, comical stories that came out of the Holocaust. But anyway, we were walking -- now the end of the camp, it just -- we just stopped working and we -- and we hung around and then they told us that we had to leave. So they lined us up five at a ti- now, sometime -- some of the guards went -- I recognized some that were from Auschwitz that had just somehow appeared there, because they were running away. And others were -- the ones that we had regularly had, and we walked. I guess we were walking we -- to the west, but it was -- this was fairly north and there was a lake there. But I right along thought we were along the North Sea, but we were a little bit south of that."

And we walked and then we walked the fields and one time -- I think the last night, we came to a city and we came into a -- what had bi- was an abandoned sugar factor -- sugar refinery. And we were settling in for the night and we had found some food already, that we were able to steal from the Germans and I was walking around and I knew this -- I mean, it was -- you could se -- really see the guar - the guards were disappearing. And all at once there was this woman, Drexler. She was an SS woman, she had been in Auschwitz and she was sitting in what had been an office, little place and she was cleaning her gun.

I wanted to get my -- talk myself out of it and finally she let me go out. This was my -- my last experience with the Nazis -- you know, with real Nazis. That was at night and the next morning we were still -- they still made us get up and walk. And we walked and walked. Towards middle afternoon, we came to -- I -- I don\u2019t remember, was it earlier? I don\u2019t know. We came on a -- onto a highway and there were tanks there, without swastikas, with five pointed white stars on it. The language was not German. Now, I had studied English, so -- in -- in high school. Of course I wasn\u2019t very good at it at that point, I hadn\u2019t spoken it. So -- but, just to hear the English and of course we knew that was it. A-Across from where we came out of this clearing and met the highway, there were -- setting up, there were rows and rows of Nazis, of SS people. And you know, the SS had some kind of a tattoo under one arm. I think under the left arm, the way they were standing, to identify them. They had done this for their own protection, but now it worked against them. So they examined everybody under the arm and they knew who was a Nazi and who was not and then I don\u2019t know what they did with them, we didn\u2019t know any more. But we, from that point on, were able to walk away."

And we arrived at the bombed out train station and we didn\u2019t\u2019 know where to go, because you know, they just dropped us there, that was it. And we looked out and the buildings all around were destroyed. So then someone to-told us that a -- an a -- an American soldier -- and it might have been this Mr. Klein, who\u2019s married to Gerda Klein, because he was looking -- this man was looking for relatives in -- from Frankfort. And he had looked throughout Europe, wherever he was -- he was a soldier and he had been in ba- in Italy. And again, someone told him there was a young boy from Frankfort and he was -- thought, well maybe this boy could tell him something. Well, the boy didn\u2019t know, but he told him his history and his name. And when this man now came in Frankfort to the train station, he was again trying to find news about people o-of his family, abou -- people who might have known or might know something, what happened to them. And we started talking to him and then he said, \u201cYou know, while I was at Italy, I spoke to a little boy and -- I mean, a young boy, he s -- he sounds like 1t would be your son,\u201d to my mother. And it turned out that he was right and he gave us addresses to write to. Of course, everything was destroyed and the mail took weeks and weeks and weeks. And my brother had been liberated by the isr -- the Palestinian contingent of the British army -- you know, there were volunteers. They were anxious to get him to Israel, because they knew there would be a war. He was still a minor, so he -- the British would let him in. They knew he would be -- there would be a war and they had another man to fight. So, while he was -- he was in Barian, Italy when he wrote to us, but while the mail was going up and back, he was already going to Palestine. And we went to Frankfort, so at least we knew that he was alive."

So, we were given a room and in bis -- with a hospital bed and that was -- that was it. But, there was some water once in awhile and I don\u2019t know what we did for hot -- for heat or whatever, because the -- the a -- the air was coming in throughout, you know? But I guess we were so used to suffering that a little more or less cold or whatever, didn\u2019t matter much. Eventually -- because we had been from Frankfort, we were given an apartment where a Nazi was thrown out. A Nazi family, they had been members of the party. So we stayed in that apartment until we left in the be -- March of -- of -- well, February, March of 1946 -- 1947. No, we stayed in that apartment for the whole time.

There were other Jews living in town and there were -- like a cl -- there was a club that you could go to, they showed movies, they showed plays.

They came to Salzheim and they trained actors f -- took them out from the DP camp and trained them to be actors. They were giving the story -- the -- the debook. Have you ha -- do you know the story -- are you familiar with it?

But the -- the -- the hoosen, the one that was -- had died and had given up his soul and was now in an -- in the other hoosen\u2019s body, he\u2019s onstage and then finally they bring out this -- the bride and it was such a solemn thing. A bride is coming and white dress and you look up and she was about nine months pregnant. And everybody broke up. It was really -- they shouldn\u2019t have let this go through, because such as -- it -- it really ruined the effect. So, this was one of the th -- but they couldn\u2019t help it, because during this time, while they were rehearsing, all this was happening. So -- but this sticks out in my mind, b-but I probably would have forgotten that we went to see the debook, except for this incident.

And I still do this, I was telling my son Allen that I\u2019m a great admirer of the 12th century Rabbi Meyer Fuffenberg, who wanted to go to Israel and I keep think -- and he was a great administrator and I keep thinking, \u201cYou know, this is wonderful. If he had only made it.\u201d He was betrayed by someone in a -- in a -- while he was waiting for a ship to come into Italy. And I keep -- kept telling Allen, \u201cYou know, I should write a story of what happened -- that he actually made it there and he set up a Jewish state and everything was wonderful.\u201d Of course the crusaders were there at the time, so it couldn\u2019t work, but anyway -- so I felt right along that I should go to Is -- but my mother didn\u2019t want to go. I don\u2019t know why. She had -- I could never ask her -- I could never figure it out. And so we came to the United States."

I mean, he was like eight months or something pregnant. And it sent them into a tailspin and they sold everything and they went to Israel.

I was given terrible orders and the -- offers, and the building\u2019s been empty for three years and my one -- my middle son went into Wall Street, in the stock market, he\u2019s doing fairly well, but he\u2019s -- the -- the other day the s -- market was down and everybody called him, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t tell me to sell?\u201d You know, I mean as if he had known and as if he could control it.

That\u2019s how my cousin ended up in Frankfort and I went to see her at the same time. She\u2019s from Israel. She lives in Israel. So, I have resisted this, but I think next time I would accept and -- but I would want to go back to Pilsen because I -- even if there\u2019s nothing there, I want to satisfy myself that there -- that I have done everything."

            "answer": "So she -- we made friends. She had -- was -- there was a younger sister. Sister was about a year, year and a half younger. And they thought that their mother had remained in Selonika. As it turned out, later on when I met the cousin, he told me that she was deported a day after the girls. But, of course, the girls couldn\u2019t know that. And Mona had this beautiful, beautiful singing voice and she told me that she wou -- wanted to be an opera singer. One of the things that the Greek girls sang a lot was Ava Maria. As a matter of fact, a few years ago, I was in Israel and -- and Yaffal and I heard Ava Maria played, so I went in to follow the sound. There was a young man from Greece pla -- and he\u2019s a painter. But he was playing -- I don\u2019t know why they happen to love Ava Maria, which is so typically, you know, a Christian and a Catholic -- well, at any rate, while she had her strength, she alwa -- we b-begged her to sing for us and she did. And then Auschwitz, of course took it\u2019s toll, her sister died. And it was like, oh, all the starch was taken out of her. The -- the -- but while she was -- while -- while we -- when we first got there, we only spoke in English. That was the way that we were able to communicate. She spoke English and -- but in -- the Nazis didn\u2019t permit anyone to speak English, because they knew they were bringing in p-people from France and they had to speak French or whatever other language. But they didn\u2019t have any prisoners from English speaking places, so, of course it was -- they -- if they had caught us, they would have really beaten us up or who knows what. So we -- being young kids, that\u2019s what we enjoyed doing, while we were still -- still had some strength. So she -- her -- her -- but her sister died and she lost all courage. All -- everything, I mean, was gone from her. And, of course, everybody got weaker at the time, so that had something to do with it. And then this SS man, Talber, heard -- I think I must have talked about this, he heard that she was -- that she had such a wonderful voice and he wanted her to be his housekeeper. Now, the Nazis didn\u2019t encourage sex between the Germans and others. It was -- would dilute the race and it would take it -- whatever. So I don\u2019t know what was on his mind once she would have been in his home. But she refused. And -- remember, you have to realize what a sacrifice she made. I mean, clean sheets, decent food and water and soap. She refused all of this and he made sure that she would not live. So he copied down her number and he made sure that with the next selection, she would go. And she did. And then -- I always thought of her, because she was this wonderful person and we -- she was a fun person while she was still alright. And when I went to -- a few times we had some Christian friends and I went to weddings and I -- they sing Ava Maria at a wedding and I\u2019m sitting there crying and everybod -- they\u2019re saying, \u201cLook at this Jewish woman, crying over Ava Maria.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t because of that, 1t was because I was thinking of my friend, Mona. And I went to Israel for the gathering and very few people from Selonika came. And I found out later on that they really being slighted by Yad Vashem and by -- it seems that the people who come from eastern Europe, central Europe, think that they\u2019re the only ones who suffered. And that the people from Greece, ah, couple of Greeks, we didn\u2019t get a -- they didn\u2019t get along in Auschwitz when they were there. They were fighting, they were different cultures, different -- they didn\u2019t speak the languages and they didn\u2019t get along too well. So they certainly didn\u2019t get along in -- so then, still not getting along now. And Yad Vashem is not doing very much for them. I think recently they have -- some of their publications have written about the Greek people, but not much. So, there were very few, as I said, people from Greece. And -- but when -- in the last night, when Me-Menachim Begin spoke and we -- at the wall, someone behind me said that he was from Selonika and I turned around -- I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people there, or whatever. I think it must have been thousands. And I turned around and I said I had a good friend from Selonika. And he said, \u201cWell, too bad you don\u2019t know the name.\u201d I said, \u201cBut I do know the name.\u201d I mentioned it to him. And _ he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a large family living -- by that name, living in Selonika.\u201d But he didn\u2019t have any address and he said write to wherever and see if a Jewish community someplace will find it for you. So when I came back, this was first thing on my mind. I called the federation and they were in touch with, you know, ev -- there was so much excitement in the air over that event at the time. They were in touch immediately with the -- a group in Athens. There was no listing for the group in Selonika, but the Athens group finally got me the cousin\u2019s name. And we corresponded. And we met -- when he came, we met about a year or two afterwards. My mother was already very sick and she couldn\u2019t come. She would have loved to come. I wanted them to come to our house in Fairlawn, they didn\u2019t want to come all the way out. I didn\u2019t want to -- they were staying in Long Island someplace, very far up, So we met at the Jewish Theological Seminary. And we met and he -- he kept writing me -- kept sending me letters and he sent me the book of a mem -- a memora book of -- in French, of what happened in -- in -- of -- of the Jews in Selonika. And the very -- but, you know, after awhile, there was nothing to write any more and wi -- and you know, we sort of drifted apart. I don\u2019t know what became of them ultimately, but it was a wonderful experience meeting up with him. And he is married to a cousin and -- this was now another cousin, but the woman -- her eyes were so much like my friends that I -- it was uncanny and I was -- it was very exciting meeting them."

And they are -- they claim to be the offspring, so I became fascinated by the story. And I became very interesting -- interested in -- in their work and in their fate, so when the -- there\u2019s a new -- New York association for Ethiopian Jews, I started buying these and now they\u2019ve become collector\u2019s items, because when everybody -- while they were in Ethiopia, they -- fo-for five dollars a month, they were -- would embroider and the five dollars a month they could buy and feed themselves. Now, most of them have left, so they don\u2019t do this any more. And in Israel, five dollars a month doesn\u2019t exactly get you somewhere. So they have given up doing this kind of work, but what happened then was, I came back, I kept buying these things and all this is Ethiopian. I have Rosh Hashanah cards and they\u2019re very -- they\u2019re very charming."

I haven\u2019t seen it, because I don\u2019t go to Florida. In Florida, she thought I -- I needed something nice. She -- that -- I had some -- done something nice for her, so she mentioned my father\u2019s name -- had his name listed in the memorial in Florida. Is -- It\u2019s in Yad Vashem and it\u2019s in the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection different museums and everywhere. And our synagogue, when I lived in Fairlawn, again made up a plaque, with the names of the Jews who sa -- didn\u2019t survive. So -- relatives. And I was sitting with a friend in the synagogue and I said, \u201cI really don\u2019t want this again.\u201d It\u2019s a-another wall and another stone and another memorial. How many should there be? And she said, \u201cYou know, but I know you\u2019ll have to do it and you\u2019ll do it anyway, because you\u2019ve been a member of the synagogue for so many years.\u201d And I did, she was right. So, when I went up to the table, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should call it Isaac or Ithzak.\u201d And someone in back of me said, \u201cWell then, call him Irving.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, how -- wha -- how does Irving get to my father?\u201d And I don\u2019t even remember what I put down, if it was Isaac or Ithzak. And I said, \u201cNow that\u2019s it. They can approach me all they want, I have to do something living -- for the living.\u201d And the only way I can honor my father is by real, living things. So I -- for a year -- two years, I adopted a -- an Ethiopian girl. She was a -- she was a maid. But I enabled her to go to dental school. She didn\u2019t become a dentist, but she became a dental hygienist and it\u2019s much better than scrubbing floors, I guess. And I\u2019m still involved with Ethiopians. The only thing was then, someone approached me and I became -- and I went on to became a -- a member of the Board of Overseers for the Rabbinic school for the Jewish Theological Seminary. Took all my energy and money, so I gave up a little bit on Ethiopians. Personally, I think that it\u2019s probably equally important to support the Ethiopians, even when there\u2019s already in Israel. So that\u2019s why I have all these Ethiopian things hanging there."
