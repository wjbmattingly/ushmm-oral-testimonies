There were -- there were 5,000 boats to be loaded, and go out into the channel to prepare. And it took time to load these boats, because you had to drive on your equipment, you had to pack it onto the boat so you could drive off. Nothing was normal, everything was practically upside-down. And in -- in the midst of everything, you looked up in the sky, where are the German planes? You worried when they come out and put the bombs on you or anything like that. And it didn\u2019t come out. And the weather, once we were out on the channel, the weather turned bad. Was a big storm coming up, so they -- they decided they couldn\u2019t land that day, on the fifth of June. The -- the sea was too rough, they couldn\u2019t unload or anything. So they delayed it 24 hours, we were circling more on the water, worried, where are the German planes? And they didn't show up. So we were more than lucky that there was no interference for -- for the whole fle -- crew. The British, the French, the American, everybody was calm. And then, finally they decided if they don\u2019t la-land the next day, they have to delay it another two or three weeks, because of the moon and the tide. They were worried that it\u2019s high water, to get the boats in closer. So they decided to land as -- on June sixth. The decision came 24 hours before, that Eisenhower made the decision, this 1s it, we have to land."

I didn\u2019t stick my neck out when I didn\u2019t have to, because I didn\u2019t see -- I couldn\u2019t see my being shipped home in a box to my father. So I did not take any special dangerous missions. One time word came around they looking for a German speaking fellow. The Germans had demanded that an American pe -- ma -- officer come over and look at an area where there\u2019s a prisoner of war camp so they wouldn\u2019t shoot and kill our own prisoners. So I said to myself, it\u2019s not my day. You know it, sometimes you wake up in the morning, you have that feeling. I took my Jeep and went out hiding for a few hours. I figured, this is not for me today. Because sometimes if they hit a Jew, they can kill him and to send back and [indecipherable] he was in an accident, or something. So I didn\u2019t go that day. That afternoon I felt this is not for me. I went into hiding for a few hours and then I come back and then I found out they had an officer in one of the regiments, lieutenant something, and they sent him over. But he came back all right with the information. You know, sometimes you wake up with a feeling, and -- and you have to take care of yourself. Another time, when we broke out from Normandy, I was up in a villa -- in an -- in a -- in a town, was just taken. There was still fighting there, Saint-Pois, it was right in Normandy. And I -- I drove into town like a big shot, and the officer, Captain Walker says to me, get the hell out of here, you have no business being here. I was ready to put up proclamations for the -- for the French people. So he says, get out. So I turned around and I got out. I figured if the mayor -- major throws you out, you\u2019re out. I went back. Next day, I had -- th-the town was taken and I came back with my proclamations. And the town was on a little hill and it had -- when you go up it had like an S curve in order to get there. So on my way up to the town, I see a Jeep blown up. I passed this, and I said to myself, I don\u2019t know what happened. When I got up into the town and th -- the regiment from the 22\" infantry was right next on the outskirts, one of the fellows, he knew me, he says, got bad news for you. He says, your friend, Feinberg, whatever his name was, was killed last night. I said, he was on patrol on a Jeep? He said yes. I said, I passed the Jeep. So I said nothing to -- the bodies were torn to pieces, four of them. I said no-nothing and I felt -- I [indecipherable] I was on the road the day before and nothing happened, so I figure the Germans came in during the night, put mines in the road. Because that Jeep was hit with a mine. So what can -- I could do nothing, if you know what I mean. I just had bad news. He was a very smart fellow and we were friends, in a way. Anyhow, coming home from the war, about -- must have been six, eight years later, I said to myself, I\u2019m going to Brooklyn to visit the family. The -- the least I can do. Th-Then -- I started out on a Sunday afternoon to go to Brooklyn. I had the address. Halfway down I said to myself, if I tell them the truth, they\u2019Il be hurt, if I lie to them, they don\u2019t let me go til I break down and tell them the truth. I turned around and went home. If you know what I mean. That\u2019s feelings."

And there they decided I don\u2019t need the operation, I just need a few days rest. So I was in that hospital and the guy in charge, the doctor in charge was a -- a -- a big drunk. I do -- he came from Detroit, he was a major, but I could see no -- no future. He gave me about 40 pills to take in one day, and he just didn\u2019t know. I think he was filled up with liquor all the time. Anyhow, they finally let me go, three weeks later or something. And when you go in the hospital you lose yourself. You can\u2019t pr -- you can\u2019t take a gun in with you, you can\u2019t take a knife in with you because they are very cautious that -- people go crazy, you -- you understand what I mean? So the -- all that they take away from you. Well anyhow, they discharged me and I got a troop train up to cher -- into Germany. Worms, a city near the Rhine. And that was what\u2019s called a replacement depot. And I was in there waiting to get assigned. Meanwhile the war had ended, and I forgot to tell you, the fourth division, in October \u201944, General Marshall came over to France and he made the speech in division headquarters, I wasn\u2019t there. He said, some of you boys will have to go to Japan when you finish the war here. So what can you do? You\u2019re part of the division, division goes, you have to go. Anyhow, I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t too anxious to go back to the division, so they assigned me to six army group in Heidelberg. From the -- from Worms, I was sent to Heidelberg and I joined -- I was in there, I was driving a Jeep, I was going on a few trips with an officer. And I had, from civilian life I had a friend who was stationed in Heidelberg. He worked for the signal corps. So I looked him up and we were friends, we were together and so on.

He opened up cobblestones in his courtyard and he pulled out a couple of cases of Moselle wine. I took 200 bottles, and I paid him a nickel a bottle. I didn\u2019t steal it. And after that the captain says to me, I\u2019m supposed to tell you the colonel said he never drank wine like that. I said, you tell him he\u2019ll never get it again like that. And that miserable captain didn\u2019t even say to me, take a bottle for yourself, 1f you know what I mean. I didn't need it, I always had a bottle of wine when I needed one. Anyhow, then a-all of a sudden the order came transferring me to a replacement near Frankfurt. So I figured this 1s -- I\u2019m getting away from that captain. So I went to Frankfurt, but now -- but -- but now [indecipherable | Hamburg, where the replacement office was and I checked in. And when I walked out in the building, my friend Colonel Gaitling walks in the street. He had come back from aus -- he had come back from somewhere and was ready for re-assignment. So he says, come up to my office, I want to talk to you. He had a -- a private room, a -- a major or a colonel gets treated well. So I went up to his office, he\u2019s -- tried to hand me a bottle of cognac. He says, I want you to come with me, I\u2019ve become security officer in Linz, which was Austria. I said, Colonel, as much as I like to go with you, but I won\u2019t -- I have a de -- I have a desire to go to my hometown and take care of things. He says, if you feel that way, you go and I get you some other time. So next morning I pack my bundle and I go to the information -- no-not information office, the -- the -- the communication office where they handled the mail and so on. I said to the guy, a -- e -- a -- are you going out into Germany with your distributings, your mail? He says yeah. I says, can I come along? He says yeah, sit in the back of the Jeep. So I had my bundle with me, nothing but a- in those days you had a ha -- half a duffel bag full. A set of underwear, and shoes, nothing much. So I sat, and within two hours we were at the very place I wanted to go. And I checked in with the captain, I said, I\u2019m here to stay, unofficially. No --"

And when I sent a draft to the consul because I -- I wanted opinions, 1f you understand what I mean, so the consul came back to America for four years to -- to Houston, Texas, and once -- first time he was here he came to New York, we had lunch together and I sent him a draft. And he said it\u2019s beautiful. He says, the nicest part is the way you carried yourself when you went back into your home village. So everybody picks something different that shakes him. So I felt good to get an opinion like that, if you -- you understand. Because the German opinion to me is worth also, and they should be heard now, because this is a different generation two generations away from the Nazis. And -- and they -- they -- they claim it could never happen again, they say. We don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still anti-Semitism in Germany today and there\u2019s a new group coming up. I got, month ago, a German magazine called Deutsche [indecipherable]. How did I get it? I have a friend in New Jersey, he\u2019s like me, he\u2019s practically the same age. And some of his friends in Germany sent him the magazine and he went through the magazine and in it he found an article about me, in the magazine, in German. So I read it, and I -- I started -- I told my bankers friend from Germany and one of them said, oh I know the magazine, that\u2019s on the right side. They are not mine -- they are not broadminded like we are. So I already know what he meant. He said, they are not leftists, they are rightists. So -- but it -- the article is from the wall str -- not the Wall Street there, from the New York Times. They -- they practically copied it. And I called the guy who wrote the article, he says only the Times can sue him for copyright. I didn\u2019t write to the Times. But it shows you what goes on and to me, for the Germans, it\u2019s important that they read what goes on. Th-They wouldn\u2019t buy this book if a German wrote it, 1-1f you know what I mean."

            "answer": "This is Colonel Gaitling, we became very good friends. This was in a rough time of the winter, I can see the boots he was wearing. They were hard to get by, but it probably was in Huertgen forest, it looks like all -- all trees around it. He was a gentleman and very human and very kind and very considerate. I never forget that we -- we broke out of Normandy and we hit the first French town and there was a little restaurant on the side, and he sent me in to buy a lunch. He was outside on the bench and ate a K-ration. And when I got inside I found my friend Salinger and John Keenan sitting at the counter eating already, so I joined them. We were at home, we were cle -- happy together. This colonel was a very outstanding soldier. He -- he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute, which is as good as West Point. Then he graduated Columbia Law School and he was working for a big law firm, a [indecipherable] law firm on broad -- on Wall Street in New York. He never told us where he was working. The boss at the Wall Street firm became Secretary of the Army under President Franklin Roosevelt. With one letter he could have been sitting in Washington for the duration, but he was too much of a soldier to let anybody know who he was. He st -- he was British descent, and he was very, very warm with you. You couldn\u2019t help it but respect him. The first or second night in France, he went on a -- he went to visit Sainte M\u00e9re Eglise, the first [indecipherable] where the paratroopers had dropped in, and while he was gone, I started t-to dig a foxhole for him, I was finished digging mine. And when he came back midnight, he scolded me because he doesn\u2019t allow me to big -- dig a foxhole for him, he\u2019s digging his own foxholes. So I apologized and I said, next time I know. He was very, very considerate. He want to make sure you eat and you clean and everything that needed for you to be care of. He never cared about anything special in his uniform. He wore the same clothes we were wearing, and every time we got into a new command post what [indecipherable] being called, he walked around and looked if there was a little stream. When he found one, he found a -- a private corner, he took his uniform off and gave himself a -- a bath in the ice cold water. I couldn\u2019t have done that, but he did every time we hit a new som -- CP. He was very articulate and he was very easy and warm to be with. Fortunately, I was able to contact him after the war. When I bought my house, I approached him and he ba -- he made the contract and title for me. He hardly took any money. And then, of course, we were - became friends. We stayed together til he passed away in 1980-something. I went to his house three, four times a year for dinner. We had wonderful times together. And I went down to the Wall Street firm and we had lunch together. It was an unusual friendship and we always find something to discuss and -- and -- and -- and enlighten us about things what have happened. One of the big things that happened was in my -- when I was in a K company, 22\" infantry, there was a big fuss, to-do, north against south. The southern boys, the hillbillies accused a couple of northern fellows for not leading a normal life, sexually. And they accused them, and the -- the company commander was brainwashed by those fellows, and he more or less listened to them. So he -- he took the accused fellow and put him into a stockade, and started bringing charges. Another sergeant whom I knew very well, of -- a very good friend of mine who was supply sergeant, he was a friend of the accused and he went to another regiment to find a lawyer to sup - to s -- defend this fellow. So he went to the 12\" regiment and found Colonel Gaitling. He was then a captain, I believe, but he was a lawyer and had th-the best of degrees. So Colonel Gaitling took the case and they brought in a very g -- big court martial. They came down from corps to handle it, they had armed guards around the building and everything. And when he did his research, he found a woman in Augusta who would swear and had the experience that she slept with that fellow."
