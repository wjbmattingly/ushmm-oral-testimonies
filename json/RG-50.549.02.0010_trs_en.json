Anyway, 1957 I had a hearing for the citizenship and the guy said to me, \u201cThis is your chance to change your name. Why don't you become Linda or Marilyn?\u201d Linda was because, it was of Linda Darnell! or -- and many of the movie stars at that time, Marilyn was because of Marilyn Monroe.

I want to change the \u201ce\u201d to an \u201ca\u201d from Renate, because I don't like the German ending and I want to chuck out my middle names.\u201d And that's how I became Renata Laqueur."

That's a story in itself. And so I was born in November 197 and I was before Christmas in Holland and we made? in Holland till -- I would say till Bergen-Belsen, so that is 1943. So my whole basic education, including gymnasium and -- no, and a year of study in Amsterdam, was all in Holland.

And I couldn't immigrate to America because I was born in Germany and I was on the German quota, so I went on my Dutch passport, as an immigrant to Canada. And within nine months, the time it takes to get a baby, I had a visa to come in as an immigrant, because I hired a lawyer in Montreal. And the moment I hit Montreal, I got an immigration lawyer, who got me nine months later, on an immigration visa to America, because I had met my second husband and I was chasing him."

So I had Dutch, French as a second language, German as the third, English as the fourth and a base of Latin and Greek. So when I got to Montreal -- I had gone to a secretarial school in Holland, because when I wanted to study, which was 1938, when I got my bachot>, my what is it, the eindexamen?\u00ae for the gymnasium. My father said, \u201cYou don't study till you have a skill.\u201d He was right.

In Canada, later on I used this education when I studied, because I could do notes. I was in comparative literature in four languages, without any problem. So I'm very grateful, because I didn't study in Holland, but I made up for it by studying later on, 40 years later."

They both were not Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection Renata Laqueur 6 February 7, 1998 raised Jewish, they had never been in a synagogue. The grandparents already, their parents were trying to assimilate. It was the time of Dreyfus in France. It was the time when a boy couldn't get into medical school if he was Jewish and so on and so on. So they got baptized I think, when they were very young, they were cousins. I think they were either 18 or 19. And so, no Jewish religion at all. And then comes Hitler. And then, he's in Holland and he's professor of medicine, pharmacology, st -- and MD, PhD and the immigrants are coming and he helps them and these were Jews who were Jews. Whether they were religious or not, they were marked as Jews and had to be helped. I have never, ever forgiven my father, it's also in my book, that in 1941, when the Germans came with this kind of ... ordering people to fill in forms where they had to put in whether they had one or two or three or four Jewish grandparents, he was so fucking German, that he filled in four. He could have gotten by with filling in none or one and he would have gotten by and I've never forgiven him for that. Because this was again the -- what do you call this? Buckling under, because of the army, the militaries, my father was an officer in the German army in the first World War. This is all, incidentally, in the g -- book of my dissertation in German. The editor has written a t -- an, what do you call it? Introduction, in which he\u2019 explained what my background is and my struggle with being German by ... let's say, by genes. But not in feeling. And my father -- let me give you the story, because this is -- all had -- all to do with later on the concentration camp. My father is born in a -- in 1880. He marries in 1905, his cousin. They marry in Germany, they are both baptized. He is finished with medica -- medical school in Heidelberg. She has no profession. They marry in 1905, in 1912 he 1s called by the University of Groningen in Holland, to 7R.L.: Renata meant to say \u201cshe.\u201d Renata Laqueur 7 February 7, 1998 come as an assistant professor, because he had made his name in pharmacology. He is, incidentally, the guy who later on, in Amsterdam, in his laboratory, did develop testosterone. So he became a very famous pharmacologist and physician and whatever. So 1912 he goes to Groningen. My three older brothers and sisters are born already. 1912 I'm not born yet. No, 19 f -- two were born in Germany, the third one was also not born -- was 14\u00b0. 1912, he's in Groningen, he's very happy, they have moved their two children and his wife and he is in Holland. The war breaks out, 1914, he volunteers -- that you should tay\u2019 to a Dutch child -- he volunteers to go into the army as a medical officer. So he goes into the ROTC, whatever it is in Germany and what do they do? They stick him, because he's a pharmacologist, he's the -- in the -- occupying German army of Belgium. He works with the gas, with the -- what we call today, the Saddam Hussein kick ass!\u00b0, because as a pharmacologist, they develop...nitrogen, mustard, you name it. Later on I come across that again in Sloan-Kettering in '53, because the first chemo is a mustard thing. Anyway -- and the result of this is, although he never, ever worked on arms, that the Belgians say you get capital punishment if you ever come to Belgium after the war. This means that we lived in Holland already, because in nine -- let me -- I'm jumping. 1914 is in Belgium for -- I don't know whether it was '16 or '17, I -- that I don't know. '18 the war is over, 1919 the Dutch want him back. And this time they want him in Amsterdam and they give him a professorship, a full chair pharmacology, MD, whatever and a laboratory. So he goes. He packs up -- by then his four children, Renata has been born. Lilo comes later, she's born in Holland. And - \u201d R.L.: Renata meant to say \u201csay.\u201d R.L.: Renata meant to say \u201cSaddam Hussein use of gas\u201d Renata Laqueur 8 February 7, 1998 why am I telling you this? And then in Holland, he -- is still 1932'!, he is a German citizen. In 1933 he becomes a Dutch citizen, with his children becoming Dutch because he wanted!\u2019, he makes his money, he's there, the children are Dutch. It had nothing to do with Hitler, it was just before. And we become Dutch. But I was always second generation. So this may be also, just as I'm talking to you, why somewhere I'm more American, because this 1s -- was my free choice."

            "answer": "You mean the concentration camp? The concentration camp, yes. On the other hand, I'm not sure at all, I might have ended up in the same concen -- or in another concentration camp if I would have been plain Dutch and working in the -- what is it -- resistance. I don't know anybody who did not not work in the resistance. It's very interesting, the people of my gymnasium class, of my let's say, high school class, out of 22, 10 died -- but a percentage and this was a non-Jewish school, which means they didn't come back. D-Don't forget we had the Japanese occupation and the German occupation. At least three of, or four of my classmates were in Japanese prisoner of war, men or women. The other ones were either picked up because they were in the resistance -- and one other one was Jewish. So you see, the percentage in Holland is unbelievable, because it's not comparable to France or Denmark or Belgium. Because Bel- Belgium had a...military command, Denmark was somehow not very serious either. We had one of the very worst Nazis, Himmler-like Seyss-Inquart!', who came from Austria and in many ways the Austrians were worse. So that was Holland. Holland had -- the percentage of people dying 1s enormous. And when you say the Jewishness has something to do with it, I'm not at all convinced of that. Because Bergen-Belsen, yes, but either Dachau or one of the female camp, Ravensbriick -- I read up on all these concentration camp because of my diary preoccupation in the dissertation. So the Jewishness -- and on the other hand, I also feel this has been a problem after the war was over -- that it didn't bring me closer to the whole Jewish problem. Because it would be naturally that I would say okay, they persecuted me, I didn't feel really part of it, but now I want to be part of it. | moved away from it. The more -- I thought about it before you came here and I thought if I add up who are my friends 15 Dr. Seyss-Inquart was appointed to oversee occupied Holland. Renata Laqueur 11 February 7, 1998 today and sociologically or that is -- yeah, sociologic -- where are they from? If you take 10 people, there are at least seven who are not Jewish. And this is in New York. A kind of, an almost -- to me it's not conscious, it's subconscious, but I avoid it carefully -- on a -- I don't know on what level, I can't -- can't even explain it. It has to do with friends, with relationships with men, friendships with women and it -- the really deepest involvements were with non-Jews. Both husbands, the first husband was baptized, is today Paul, lives in Germany\u2019\u00ae. He married a woman who was 35 years younger. That is his third marriage and the second one was Dutch nobility. He had four children with her, the third one is 35 years younger, dee!\u2019 wasn't even born yet!\u00ae. He's 84 and we are corresponding, we see each other each time when I'm in Germany and we still love each other. We're friends. But he also has veered away from anything which is Jewish -- was fully Jewish born, parents were not even baptized. But you either go with or you do totally without. I have never realized it until now, when I get such interviews that I think. I said, \u201cHow does it tally up?\u201d And I figured it out last night. Never thought about it."

            "answer": "Well, I had to do -- da -- da -- now comes -- now comes, how did I get to the dissertation? And this is, of course, part of this whole thing, because you see, how come, if your life was so different in America. I was married to a psychiatrist, we didn't have much money because he had divorced and I didn't have the money yet, which would come free from Holland, only much later. And we were doing things in a very frugal way, but we had a lot of fun in New York. New York in the 50's was great. You could go to the theater for four dollars and to the movie for 50 cents. We went in the afternoon to the movies, in the evening to the theater, so that was fine. But... in 1965, the diary I'd kept in -- in the camp, was published in Holland, as a paperback. And a friend of mine took care of that and she went to a good Dutch publisher and that was it and when I studied at NYU -- I don't know whether it's on the first tape, I don't think so. When I studied at NYU, it was between '60 and '71. Already, before the BA, I realized I don't want to have anything really to do with Spanish, I want English literature. Because it was a foreign literature for me. It opened up vistas. And my American lit professor said, when I wrote papers, he said, \u201cRenata, you write well, have you ever written anything?\u201d I said, \u201cSure. I wrote stories in Holland and I wrote for women's magazine and I always liked to report things. And I have a diary.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat kind?\u201d I said, \u201cA Dutch diary in Bergen-Bel --\u201d\u2019.\u201d He said, \u201cEy? Anne Frank?\u201d I said, \u201cNo Anne Frank.\u201d I said, \u201cI wrote in a camp and it is in Dutch and it's published.\u201d He said, \u201cCan I read it?\u201d I said, \u201cIf you can read Dutch, you can read it.\u201d He said, \u201cWill you translate it?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy would I?\u201d It was 1963 or something. And he said, \u201cDo me a favor, translate it. I'll get you somebody to help you with it, from NYU, a graduate student. You dictate and he puts it in a typewriter.\u201d We 27 R.L.: Bergen-Belsen Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Renata Laqueur 23 February 7, 1998 didn't have a computer at that time. So I dictated and he did it and I still have that, I have the manuscript. It's still bad English because my English wasn't as good, was 25 years -- 30 years ago. Anyway, he tried at that time to get it to publishers. He tried everyone, from the biggies to the small ones, from Random House to everywhere and they all said, \u201cIt's not sexy enough, not violent enough, understated. It's Hemingway-like understated.\u201d So nothing happened, forgot about it. Then comes the dissertation, where my husband says on a beach in Turkey, when I say I want to write the dissertation, 1969, about the aviator in literature or the doctor in literature. He said, \u201cAre you crazy? You're never going to get finished. Why don't you take your diary and find other diaries. You know they were written. Get a fellowship, do it.\u201d I did. Got it in a year and a half. So this is how the diary and then the -- the diary -- the di- dissertation was done, he dies. To my mind, he -- his death came earlier and I felt very guilty about it, because I had been totally absorbed for two years in getting this stuff out of the way. And that's when you said to me, my husband didn't take to it too much when I went back to school. Deso fully understood my total dedication, was completely wrapped up with it himself, read everything I wrote, criticized very constructively, but was dead tired of the whole stuff, because I was -- I had also been in Germany in between and of course did whole stuff to digest that. I defended my dissertation in May 1971. He was dead 19th of November, '71. That meant -- he had congestive heart failure, he had smoked himself to death. And he kind of gave up. And that's it."

He was the first man for me and we come back from the concentration camp, as he says today, I know I saved his life, so he 1s totally grateful and happy and whatever, we are good friends. Our marriage was on the rocks, because I don't know, I said this already on the tape, but I'm saying it again, I don't know any marriage which survived the concentration camp if they both were there. Because they grew apart. Same thing with prisoners of war in Japan and even Vietnam, I know all these things happen. Paul and I grew apart, he married, I remarried, how did I remarry? In 1950, I'm his wife and I write stories and I help him with his practice, he was a speech therapist and I'm a housewife. And I'm pretty happy. We had had a child, the child died. He had a girlfriend, I had boyfriends. We Renata Laqueur 25 February 7, 1998 lived a very much after the war life\u2019, growing apart and still together. In 1950, in July, he tells me, \u201cWe have an international congress of speech pathology, why don't you work for that?\u201d And I became the sec -- the treasurer for that, big deal. In August 1950, the treasurer of that international convention comes from New York and my husband Paul tells me, \u201cHe 1s the guy you should have married. Because I met him when I studied in Vienna before the war.\u201d He had studied with him, speech pathology and whatever. And he said, \u201cHe is older than you, but this is exactly what you should have m -- cause you should have ne-never married me, we know that.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, I'm not going to marry him, I'm -- I'm not going divorcing you. I'm okay.\u201d A week later I asked him for a divorce. I said, \u201cYou're absolutely right, this is the guy I'm going to marry. He doesn't know it yet. I know I'm going to marry him.\u201d Ah, let's see. I went with the guy to Paris, with the -- with my second husband and it was a wildly beautiful affair, 18 years older. And he said, \u201cI'm married, I have no children, a very unhappy marriage.\u201d I said, \u201cI know.\u201d I knew that already from Paul, from Vienna, from 1936. He had said, \u201cHe has a very unhappy marriage.\u201d And so on. He said, \u201cI love you, but we will never, ever get together because I live in New York, I have no money. I have to restudy, do my medicine over again. I have -- I'm only beginning and my wife will never let me go.\u201d I said, \u201cLeave it to me. I'm immigrating.\u201d That's how I got to Canada, that's how I got to America. I divorced Paul, 1950. I said -- he had a girlfriend. I went to his girlfriend and I said, \u201cI'm leaving. I'm going to Canada. Please marry Paul, he can't be alone.\u201d She said, \u201cI won't marry a Jew.\u201d I said, \u201cYou can live with him and you*\u00ae can be your boyfriend and you 2\u00b0 R.L.: Renata meant to say \u201cWe lived a very much an after the war life...\u201d 39 R.L.: Renata meant to say \u201che.\u201d Renata Laqueur 26 February 7, 1998 won't marry him?\u201d She said, \u201cMy family wouldn't let me.\u201d I said, \u201cHe's not a Jew, he's baptized.\u201d Any \u2014 could we go over this, she married him, they have four children.

So you combine the bottom, with the top, with the middle, with the upper, with the evening, with the middle, with the s -- beach, whatever. I had 10 pieces and I put them on a postcard, I drew them.

And we will send you to Paris and you can have a dress and you can have perfume and you can have this and become a fashion reporter. So I did this for a year. And I had a press card, so when I went to Montreal, I still had a press card. So this is how I got into fashion and the fashion has remained with me, in a way that I'm still very interested, but I've never done anything. But it was again the competitive spirit."

I traded in the perfume for food in Bergen-Belsen, | traded always something. But the lipstick and it has been ever since, it is protest against my father. When, in 1937, the year before I graduated gymnasium high school, I was at the wedding of my oldest brother, who married a Catholic girl from Brabant. Was a beautiful, Catholic wedding. And I had a dress which was eh, something I didn't like, but you know, teenage stuff. And I had my first lipstick on. My father walked across the hall in that hotel where the reception was. He came with his napkin. He spit on the napkin and he wiped off my lipstick, in public. \u201cMy daughter doesn't wear lipstick.\u201d So the lipstick fixation came from something. I know where things come from. And that's not repressed. So there's the lipstick.

The war had involved both Deso and me because Deso was a psychiatrist and kept people out of the war, with certifications. I was at NYU, you know, we were all anti, anti, anti. In the beginning we were for it. For the first, I would say, the first three years or two years, '33, '34\u00b0\u2019, whenever we were in, being Europeans, we were for it. Because we saw again the salami. If you give them one piece, you give them everything. The whole Communist haunt, the whole business. And then as the war went on, we turned around. But by 1970, we were already in 1968, after Tonkin, we turned again. I have family, relatives, nephews who were in the Marines. The non-Jewish part of my family. They were Marines in Vietnam, captains, enlisted men, whatever. And those guys turned while they were there. My Lai. I mean I'm just giving you examples. You see, when we talk about chaos and continuity. So I'm in Munich, 1970, May, for the first time on my fellowship. First Paris, then Amsterdam, and then Munich, to find diaries. And I made one promise to myself, you do not shake hands with anybody who is your own age, you don't talk to anybody who is your own age, because you know that they all lied to you. So, in other words, at the institute where I did my research, if I got a real old guy and a guy who said, \u201cGnadige Frau,\u201d kiss your hand, you know, the whole garbage, of the Bavarian civility, which is close to the Austrians. I was ice cold. I said, \u201cI need this and this and this from your library, I need this and this and this.\u201d I wouldn't fraternize with the younger people already then. When I met people who showed me -- give you one example. The younger people were already, in 1970, 25 years after the war, when I talked to the Renata Laqueur 36 February 7, 1998 people who were 20, 25, 30, they had nothing to do with it. And I met younger people in Munich. Among others, a young woman who showed me around in Dachau. She said, \u201cDo you want to see Dachau, now that you want the diaries?\u201d I said, \u201cOf course.\u201d I had been a smoker, I smoked, learned to smoke only during the war. In Dachau, I hadn't smoked for 16 years. I hadn't smoked from '54 to 1970. In Dachau, I said, \u201cI want a cigarette.\u201d I smoked again from '70, til '92, til the cancer. They told me at Sloan-Kettering, \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d \u201cT smoke very little.\u201d He said, \u201cIf you smoke, we don't operate.\u201d Anyway, so Germany was something I did because it wa-- End of Tape One, Side B Renata Laqueur 37 February 7, 1998 Beginning Tape Two, Side A ",

I've never seen her again, but to give you one example, I become easily friends with people if it is business and interesting. But I will not be intimidated or sentimental just because somebody is nice to me, if I don't trust them. That carried over into 1985. 1985, the diary had been published in 1983 in Germany. I[ had seen the proofs, I had seen the translation and so on and then I had met my diarist, who is hanging up there, Renata Laqueur 38 February 7, 1998 there's a*\u00b0 picture on the left, the young guy. And he had translated it and I had met him in Amsterdam and he convinced me to come to Germany in May, 1985. As you say in French, in English*\u2019, contre-coeur, against my heart. And I said, \u201cPeter, I'll come, but I hate it.\u201d He said, \u201cI'll make it worth your while, you'll meet the people who are like me, who are born in the late 30's or in the early 40's or after the war and you will see that they want to know, they want to help, they want to do.\u201d I said, \u201cI don't believe it.\u201d I was very Jewish in this respect. Jews never believe anybody would do that. And he said, \u201cI'll prove it.\u201d He proved it. He proved it from the moment till he disproved it and I never saw him again. The following -- I've never told anybody this. 1945, in May, I came to Germany, he introduced me to the papers, he introduced me to the Frankfurter Zeitung. That's where I met the editor who now published my latest article. Everything went wrong. I had always told him, I will meet your family only if you can guarantee me that they were okay. Because I'm not going to be in anybody's house, where you were either involved. You told me that your father had worked in Bergen-Belsen as an electrician and that's how you knew. He couldn't help that he worked there, fine, good. I'll meet your family. While I was in May, with him, we spent a day with his family around Bergen-Belsen. Were received very nicely, his mother, his father, sister, younger people, right?** Very, very nice. When I came back, in '86 for the movie which they had made about him and me walking in Bergen-Belsen in 1985, I met him again in Hannover and we talked and we again talked about -- he was doing more research about this whole thing and we talked about 4\u201d R.L.: Renata meant to say \u201chis.\u201d 41 R.L.: Renata meant to say \u201c...or in English.\u201d 4 R.L.: Renata meant to say, \u201cWe were received nicely, by his mother, his father, his sister, younger people, right?\u201d Renata Laqueur 39 February 7, 1998 meeting the wrong or the right people. He said, \u201cI lied to you. My father was in the -- \u201d What is the brown -- the brown shirts? \u201cThe SA.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay. I still love you, but I will never meet you again and I will never meet your family again.\u201d That's how you can trust people. I've never seen him again. He has disappeared. Because I told him, \u201cThis doesn't make any sense, why didn't you tell me right away? I would -- with you I have no problem. You were born in '44. You published my diary, you've translated it. I would sit by candlelight for your children.*? With -- with a pen,\u201d not with a thing. But I said, \u201cI don't want to be lied to, I don't trust you any more.\u201d Bastard. That's it. That's the relationship with Germany. It remains that way. If I have friends who tried to whitewash the past, I said, \u201cLook, I don't mind it. I have a father who was a quote unquote \u2018war criminal.\u2019\u201d In the first World War, that's how they saw him in Belgium, but at least I knew about it. I can deal with it. But if I'm told something wrong, I can't deal with it. Then I don't open up. That's chaos. And I am too stupid to lie. Because if I lie, I have to remember when I lie. I can't do that. I may repress it, I may forget it. Reminds me of Clinton."

I'm only thinking about it now, I haven't thought about it for 30 years. That he is deep into literature, deep into all the things he remembers about the good, old time when he was a student, free, a teacher.

So we were in Damascus, we were in the whole Syrian north, so the art and the thing and then crossed over from Amman, we were in Jordan, very strange trip at that time.

And that is one of the reasons, I'm not bitter about it, but I ended up with the literary agent of Norman Mailer, Gerald Green and a couple of other famous writers, where I gave him my diary and the dissertation and I think I paid him 800 dollars to just read the crap. And he came back with a criticism which I have somewhere. I've hidden it, but it is like going into psychoanalysis. What he said hurt so deeply that I got burned. He said, \u201cIt's very original, it's very real, but it is totally unpublishable because there is no sex, there is no real violence, there 1s no -- it's not sellable, salable.\u201d If I would be dead it would sell like hotcakes! I know that. If Anne Frank wouldn't have died, the diary would never have been published. You have to die in order to prove something. I'm not bitter, because I'm delighted to be Renata Laqueur 59 February 7, 1998 here. But how often have I said in Germany, if I would have been died\u2019, I wouldn't need you to publish it. But the Germans had a bad conscience, so they published it. Isn't that kind of funny?"

We are going with the grotesque into the 21st century. Everything is upside down, topsy turvy.

But there are always levels nobody will ever talk about. So what? So you go from level one with the elevator down in the basement and then you go below the earth's surface and then you go all the way up and you come on the other side of the earth and you come up again.

I'm not hurting more than anybody else, I think I hurt less, because I have in -- desensitized myself. I refuse to feel pain. That's part of survival. Some people said to me, \u201cYou never mourned for your husband, whom you dearly loved.\u201d He was the great love of my life. I said, \u201cWho has time?\u201d If I do that -- I've barely given myself time to recuperate, in order to get on top again. So that is the style, but that's not something which other people do, or should do. This is very, very unusual and may eventually, finally kill me. This week -- okay, let it be, I'll leave it on, although I haven't told anybody, ever. This week I went to the tailor and I had to have a pair of sh -- pants shortened. I step out of my pants, I step back into them and it's in a little stall where you have a curtain around you because it's in the shop and I have nothing to hold on and I knew I was going to fall. And I only told myself, \u201cNot on your head.\u201d So I fell backwards and I'm used to being very limber. And the guy was not there. I said, \u201cI'm falling.\u201d He said, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d I told myself, \u201cGeez, what does God have to do with?\u201d I fell. I hurt myself quite badly on my right side and I told myself, \u201cDon't break your hip.\u201d I have osteoporosis, of course. Don't break this, but I suddenly realized, once again I had gone beyond what I should be doing. I should have known that with this side effects I have, I should hold onto something. But I didn't.

And I told myself, \u201cYou got to do something because otherwise you end up paying 100 dollars an hour to talk about the crap.\u201d So that done it. So what did I do? I decided I wear, every day, besides clean underwear, which I do anyway, every day something different. Even if you're alone. Don't wear the same T-shirt, though you wash it. Wear some jewelry. You always wear lipstick. So do it. I've not been really depressed any more. I found the way. That happened in -- around my birthday in November. Now it's February, I'm doing okay. But I forced myself. Do it, make a plan, finish every day something, even if it is crud, but do it. And don't watch so much television, now again. O.J. I didn't watch, but this Clinton thing. Okay.
