And I couldn't immigrate to America because I was born in Germany and I was on the German quota, so I went on my Dutch passport, as an immigrant to Canada. And within nine months, the time it takes to get a baby, I had a visa to come in as an immigrant, because I hired a lawyer in Montreal.

The grandparents already, their parents were trying to assimilate. It was the time of Dreyfus in France. It was the time when a boy couldn't get into medical school if he was Jewish and so on and so on. So they got baptized I think, when they were very young, they were cousins. I think they were either 18 or 19. And so, no Jewish religion at all. And then comes Hitler. And then, he's in Holland and he's professor of medicine, pharmacology, st -- and MD, PhD and the immigrants are coming and he helps them and these were Jews who were Jews. Whether they were religious or not, they were marked as Jews and had to be helped. I have never, ever forgiven my father, it's also in my book, that in 1941, when the Germans came with this kind of ... ordering people to fill in forms where they had to put in whether they had one or two or three or four Jewish grandparents, he was so fucking German, that he filled in four. He could have gotten by with filling in none or one and he would have gotten by and I've never forgiven him for that. Because this was again the -- what do you call this? Buckling under, because of the army, the militaries, my father was an officer in the German army in the first World War. This is all, incidentally, in the g -- book of my dissertation in German. The editor has written a t -- an, what do you call it? Introduction, in which he\u2019 explained what my background is and my struggle with being German by ... let's say, by genes. But not in feeling. And my father -- let me give you the story, because this is -- all had -- all to do with later on the concentration camp. My father is born in a -- in 1880. He marries in 1905, his cousin. They marry in Germany, they are both baptized. He is finished with medica -- medical school in Heidelberg. She has no profession. They marry in 1905, in 1912 he 1s called by the University of Groningen in Holland, to 7R.L.: Renata meant to say \u201cshe.\u201d  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He is, incidentally, the guy who later on, in Amsterdam, in his laboratory, did develop testosterone. So he became a very famous pharmacologist and physician and whatever. So 1912 he goes to Groningen. My three older brothers and sisters are born already. 1912 I'm not born yet. No, 19 f -- two were born in Germany, the third one was also not born -- was 14\u00b0. 1912, he's in Groningen, he's very happy, they have moved their two children and his wife and he is in Holland. The war breaks out, 1914, he volunteers -- that you should tay\u2019 to a Dutch child -- he volunteers to go into the army as a medical officer. So he goes into the ROTC, whatever it is in Germany and what do they do? They stick him, because he's a pharmacologist, he's the -- in the -- occupying German army of Belgium. He works with the gas, with the -- what we call today, the Saddam Hussein kick ass!\u00b0, because as a pharmacologist, they develop...nitrogen, mustard, you name it. Later on I come across that again in Sloan-Kettering in '53, because the first chemo is a mustard thing. Anyway -- and the result of this is, although he never, ever worked on arms, that the Belgians say you get capital punishment if you ever come to Belgium after the war. This means that we lived in Holland already, because in nine -- let me -- I'm jumping. 1914 is in Belgium for -- I don't know whether it was '16 or '17, I -- that I don't know. '18 the war is over, 1919 the Dutch want him back. And this time they want him in Amsterdam and they give him a professorship, a full chair pharmacology, MD, whatever and a laboratory. So he goes. He packs up -- by then his four children, Renata has been born. Lilo comes later, she's born in Holland.

In 1933 he becomes a Dutch citizen, with his children becoming Dutch because he wanted!\u2019, he makes his money, he's there, the children are Dutch. It had nothing to do with Hitler, it was just before. And we become Dutch. But I was always second generation.

On the other hand, I'm not sure at all, I might have ended up in the same concen -- or in another concentration camp if I would have been plain Dutch and working in the -- what is it -- resistance. I don't know anybody who did not not work in the resistance. It's very interesting, the people of my gymnasium class, of my let's say, high school class, out of 22, 10 died -- but a percentage and this was a non-Jewish school, which means they didn't come back. D-Don't forget we had the Japanese occupation and the German occupation. At least three of, or four of my classmates were in Japanese prisoner of war, men or women. The other ones were either picked up because they were in the resistance -- and one other one was Jewish. So you see, the percentage in Holland is unbelievable, because it's not comparable to France or Denmark or Belgium. Because Bel- Belgium had a...military command, Denmark was somehow not very serious either. We had one of the very worst Nazis, Himmler-like Seyss-Inquart!', who came from Austria and in many ways the Austrians were worse. So that was Holland. Holland had -- the percentage of people dying 1s enormous. And when you say the Jewishness has something to do with it, I'm not at all convinced of that. Because Bergen-Belsen, yes, but either Dachau or one of the female camp, Ravensbriick -- I read up on all these concentration camp because of my diary preoccupation in the dissertation. So the Jewishness -- and on the other hand, I also feel this has been a problem after the war was over -- that it didn't bring me closer to the whole Jewish problem. Because it would be naturally that I would say okay, they persecuted me, I didn't feel really part of it, but now I want to be part of it. | moved away from it.

A kind of, an almost -- to me it's not conscious, it's subconscious, but I avoid it carefully -- on a -- I don't know on what level, I can't -- can't even explain it. It has to do with friends, with relationships with men, friendships with women and it -- the really deepest involvements were with non-Jews. Both husbands, the first husband was baptized, is today Paul, lives in Germany\u2019\u00ae. He married a woman who was 35 years younger.

And we were doing things in a very frugal way, but we had a lot of fun in New York. New York in the 50's was great. You could go to the theater for four dollars and to the movie for 50 cents. We went in the afternoon to the movies, in the evening to the theater, so that was fine. But... in 1965, the diary I'd kept in -- in the camp, was published in Holland, as a paperback. And a friend of mine took care of that and she went to a good Dutch publisher and that was it and when I studied at NYU -- I don't know whether it's on the first tape, I don't think so. When I studied at NYU, it was between '60 and '71. Already, before the BA, I realized I don't want to have anything really to do with Spanish, I want English literature.

So I dictated and he did it and I still have that, I have the manuscript. It's still bad English because my English wasn't as good, was 25 years -- 30 years ago. Anyway, he tried at that time to get it to publishers. He tried everyone, from the biggies to the small ones, from Random House to everywhere and they all said, \u201cIt's not sexy enough, not violent enough, understated. It's Hemingway-like understated.\u201d So nothing happened, forgot about it. Then comes the dissertation, where my husband says on a beach in Turkey, when I say I want to write the dissertation, 1969, about the aviator in literature or the doctor in literature. He said, \u201cAre you crazy? You're never going to get finished. Why don't you take your diary and find other diaries. You know they were written. Get a fellowship, do it.\u201d I did. Got it in a year and a half. So this is how the diary and then the -- the diary -- the di- dissertation was done, he dies. To my mind, he -- his death came earlier and I felt very guilty about it, because I had been totally absorbed for two years in getting this stuff out of the way. And that's when you said to me, my husband didn't take to it too much when I went back to school. Deso fully understood my total dedication, was completely wrapped up with it himself, read everything I wrote, criticized very constructively, but was dead tired of the whole stuff, because I was -- I had also been in Germany in between and of course did whole stuff to digest that. I defended my dissertation in May 1971. He was dead 19th of November, '71. That meant -- he had congestive heart failure, he had smoked himself to death. And he kind of gave up. And that's it."

And I had a dress which was eh, something I didn't like, but you know, teenage stuff. And I had my first lipstick on. My father walked across the hall in that hotel where the reception was.

That's where I met the editor who now published my latest article. Everything went wrong. I had always told him, I will meet your family only if you can guarantee me that they were okay.

The zertrimmern is you really split, you can hear almost the stones coming apart. The German language is gruesome. It's like the fairy tales.

I'm thinking about how d -- I have a chapter in the dissertation about the German language, the SS language, where they talk about the Dritte Reich, the Third Reich expressions.

I had a big argument in Germany about that book. The Goldhagen book is incredible. It's a lousy, biased version of the whole thing, because he \u201cforgets\u201d about the Gypsies, he forgets about the non-Jews who were killed.

They gave me penicillin and I went into shock. And they called my husband who was work out in Creedmore as a psychiatrist, they said, \u201cRenata is in shock, come. We gave her penicillin and she's --\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat's she talking?\u201d He says, \u201cEnglish.\u201d So in other words, English has become my communication. At the same time, I also know -- and this has nothing to do with me, but I know from Holland and from the resistance that if they gave people -- they didn't have to torture them, they just wanted to find out where they were from, all they had to do was take a pin, and how they said \u201cow\u201d, or \u201cai\u201d or \u201couch\u201d or \u201coy\u201d, they know where they came from. And I know from having been married to a psychiatrist and having dealt with all kinds of issues also at Sloan-Kettering, that if you are in pain and how you react, it will bring back your mother tongue. And what I say, when they do something, I'm -- I'm usually don't say anything, I\u2019m not a howler, I'm very tough -- is -- it may go back to German or to Dutch, but I doubt it. Because even in shock I talked English. But I know, for instance, that the aunt of my husband -- he was Jewish, Deso -- and she came from Poland and her children were very un- Jewish because they had married American Fortune 500 people. And got made it up in the media>\u2019 and wherever, and she refused to say that she was Jewish, although her name was Margulies. They said it was French and they said he had been to the Sorbonne when he had never been near it. Doesn't make any difference, but they were not Jewish. What does bad luck have? She gets a stroke and she talks only Polish and Yiddish. So this is where I'm very careful and I tell myself, don't ever deny anything, because if you're on your deathbed or if you have a stroke, you'll talk anyway, whatever it is.
