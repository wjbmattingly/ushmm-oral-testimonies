They were children of a first husband of my mother\u2019s. My parents were originally from Lithuania, as was my mother\u2019s first husband. In fact, I still possess her Ketuba from Lithuania, and her permit to travel in the pale (ph) of Russia, and she came as immigrant as many people did at the time of the turn of the century when everybody seemed to be leaving for the United States, and she was one of those immigrants that got stuck in Britain. As you probably know, almost all of them \u2014 particularly the Jews \u2014 intended to come to America where the streets were supposed to  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 2 be lined with gold, but my mother got left behind, and eventually met my father who married her, and I grew up in this large family as the youngest child, and it was rather nice."

She was an orphan, according to what she told me \u2014 I\u2019m sure she spoke the truth \u2014 and was married to a cousin, and the grandfather \u2014 her grandfather who brought her up \u2014 felt 1t was important for her, also, to leave. I think she loved Lithuania and would\u2019ve liked to have stayed. You know, this story that people tell of pogroms are not always true. A lot of them left for economic reasons, just as everybody else left Europe for economic reasons."

I was a child growing up in a family of adults, and since ostensibly I was a weak child, I was always being sent away to recuperate. So, I didn\u2019t grow up close to this family, close emotionally to this family. I did to my eldest sister, who is really a half-sister, but I was very much, I think, a lone child because everybody else was older than I. The next one in the family was five years older than I."

He explained to me what was going on, but he was not a religious man. The nice thing I remember about being Jewish, I suppose, was the wonderful Friday evenings when we all gathered together, and on the holidays when friends would also come, and for the Passover when they would invite people who didn\u2019t have family. My mother was a very generous, warm, and kind person, and she was always inviting people into the house. She was very forward-looking, I think. I hope, that I have some of her characteristics."

There was a lot of employment even \u2014 not even, but in my family, too. I began to be aware that things were happening in Germany when I was 14 or 15, a settlement house, of which I was member, began to have youngsters from Germany come to learn English, to help pass the time. They were builted (ph) locally, and I got to know some of them and felt awful that they had been sent to Britain, let\u2019s say in \u00b035-\u201936, without their parents \u2014 to a foreign country where most of them had no relatives, and I felt very deeply about this. I think this is what affected me when eventually the British asked for volunteers to go overseas. I felt 1t was important that I must go."

            "answer": "No, they didn\u2019t. They just \u2014 they didn\u2019t talk about it. One didn\u2019t ask. Firstly, being British, you\u2019re rather reticent, anyway, but one had a sense that these kids were alone, terribly alone. There was no family. There were no cousins. Occasionally, one would have an aunt in the country, and that would be rather nice because she had family to  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 4 relate to, but in the 30s, many German parents \u2014 rather, not many, but a number of German parents who could afford it were sending their children to school in England because German law prohibited them from attending school. Very early on in, I think, 1933, the first law came in which limited the number of Jewish children who could attend school. And so, a number of them came to England to school, and they were taken in by families. There was an organization called B\u2019nai B\u2019rith, which still exists, and they helped a lot of these children, particularly the Orthodox Jewish children."

            "answer": "Well, firstly the war came in \u201939. I remember we had the bombing in London, and 90 days of bombing constantly is not very pleasant."
        },

            "num": 19,
            "question": "What was that like?",
            "answer": "That was pretty awful. Very often, I would be scared and I\u2019d sit under a table, or I would like people to think that I was brave and so I took tea to the shelters wearing my tin hat until I was going out one day with a young friend, and a piece of shrapnel went through his tin hat, and he was no longer. It was frightening and yet, you didn\u2019t like to appear a coward. We did things that we would never do. We went into the streets and put out incendiary bombs because, since the government, I suppose, wanted to know how many incendiaries had been dropped, they would pay us a half a crown which was about half a dollar in those days, to bring in the ends of incendiary bombs. So, we\u2019d go out and we\u2019d pick these things up once the bomb had gone off. And, yet, we used to sit on the doorstep occasionally in an air raid, and say, \u201cWhat will we tell our children of the war?\u201d And, you know, we were eating peanuts and we\u2019d say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll tell them that we sat on the doorstep eating peanuts.\u201d But, it was an interesting period because we never saw a fruit. If anybody brought in an orange, if an American soldier gave somebody an orange or a banana, we raffled it to the Red Cross. We didn\u2019t go hungry. We were never short of the most awful bread you can ever imagine, and the American powdered egg, which we even thought made good cakes, you know, we had forgotten what a good cake tasted like. But, as I say, we were never hungry, and interestingly, we always knew we were going to win the war. Don\u2019t ask me why, perhaps this was a moral booster, perhaps this was Churchill\u2019s speeches, but we never thought the Germans would overrun us. Of course, we always suspected that we would be invaded, and this influenced, of course, the British attitude toward the refugees. We suspected everybody with a German accent of being a spy. It was a very difficult period for them, much more so than for us."

I wouldn\u2019t go. I felt safest in London, believe it or not. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being outside of London and seeing the bombs falling, because you could see the fires."

There was no counseling 1n those days, and I sometimes wonder if we have too much counseling when a child goes through a small trauma, true, a trauma, but in the old days going through this bombing, nobody came and counseled us and very often we were helping to dig bodies out of the Anderson shelters and finding people who were wounded badly, but we carried on. You know, this was life."

The most wonderful thing to happen to us was when Hitler invaded Russia because then the bombing began to let up. And it was extraordinary because we all felt so guilty that here the Russians were taking what we had been having, and in those days, Russia was our friend. The Cold War that came later seemed so \u2014 so different, so difficult a period when we think of, we knew what the Russians were going through, that millions were being killed by the Germans, millions and millions of them. I don\u2019t think people even today realize how many millions of people were killed during that war outside of concentration camps. I mean, we talk of six million Jews dying, and that number, you can\u2019t imagine what six million is, and it was dreadful. There isn\u2019t a Jewish family, I think, worldwide, which didn\u2019t lose a relative, but in Russia, about 25 million people died."

            "question": "After 1941, when Russia was attacked, did you learn what was going on in terms of the killing of Jews and did you know what had gone on in Germany in the \u201930s, rounding up  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 6 political opponents and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses? Was there much knowledge that you had at that point?",
            "answer": "If we read The Press and The Times published a lot of material. We knew. I\u2019m not saying I was very well-versed in what was happening. I knew Jews were being killed. I knew they were being put in concentration camps because sometimes a friend would have a cousin who was 15, who\u2019d been brought out whose head was shaven, and he\u2019d been incarcerated in a concentration camp. We knew that people were being killed. We knew that the Nazis were very nasty people, but when the killing really started, when the Final Solution started in 1942, I don\u2019t think we, as individuals, I don\u2019t remember, but I don\u2019t think I knew this. We didn\u2019t trust the Germans. We knew they\u2019d kill every Jew they could get their fingers on. So, from that point of view, we knew we had to be very careful. For example, if you would walk along the country lane in England, or even an ordinary street, and ask somebody directions, they\u2019d never tell you in case you were a spy. The sign posts were taken down. So, unless you knew the area in which you were visiting, there was nothing you could do. We were terribly afraid of being invaded. Ostens- you know, not ostensibly, obviously because we were 21 miles from the French coast, not very far, and not too far across the North Sea to get to England, and attempts were made to bring spies in. So, it was a very difficult period because, if you met somebody you didn\u2019t know, you didn\u2019t discuss anything that might in some way give them information."

            "answer": "Yes, I was taking a course in social administration, and when I finished that course, I went up to Birmingham during the course, actually to work at a settlement house in Birmingham, and then I went up to one in Nottingham where conditions were very different from London. And it was there that I heard that the British government, being the British government that it is, 1t always works closely with voluntary agencies, was asking for volunteers who would go overseas to any country to which they were sent with no prejudice, to help to save survivors both Jews and non-Jews, and I thought that was a marvelous idea, but I was terrified of getting on a ship because ships could be sunk. You know, we were losing so many ships during that war, but many people older than I were volunteering, and, what the heck? I must say, at that time I talked to my mother because I was her baby, and I told her what was happening and that it would be wonderful if we would find Jews who survived because even in the \u201930s, as young as I was, I had some daydream that I could go to Germany and rescue Jews. At least help them to get their jewelry out so they could have some money when they came to England. My mother said, \u201cThey would never let you out.\u201d Or, \u201cThey\u2019d never let you in. You\u2019re Jewish.\u201d I said, \u201cBut, Mother, they would never know.\u201d Of course, nobody would take me at age 16, but when this call came, I did volunteer. There were some people I respected who had volunteered, and the nice thing was I was chosen to go originally to Casablanca with a man called Friedman I think his name was. He was from Manchester. An American went as well. We were going to take care of Jews in a camp, but the French at that time were having trouble in Lebanon, so I learned, and so the British wouldn\u2019t allow any women out of the country. So, Morris Friedman went for Britain, and I waited for the next unit. He went alone, and the next unit \u2014 each unit was ten persons. The first British-Jewish unit was seven Jews and three Quakers, and there were units of the Red Cross, of the St. John\u2019s Ambulance Brigade, and all of the voluntary agencies that you know so well today. I think hundreds of people volunteered, and when I say volunteered, by the way, we volunteered to go without salary, just to go wherever the government sent us to help survivors. And I knew we were going somewhere where it was warm because we were issued with a summer kit. I couldn\u2019t tell my mother where I was going. My father, by the way, died when I was 14. So, I\u2014 my father wasn\u2019t there to tell. But I knew we must be going somewhere where it was warm, but where? You know, one had no idea, and I must say, I lied to my mother. I said I was going to a camp in Scotland for about a month, and when we came out of the camp, I would call her. And, of course, on February the 19\", 1944, we got aboard a ship and sailed, and about a month later in convoy, landed in Egypt in Port Said."

            "answer": "Not all of us. The two of age groups met individually, and we had training camps at one of the Rothschild estates. I was a cook in one of them. So, the people would not only eat decently, but be able to attend the various sessions. There was some very good people who came and talked about what we might find, but who would know what we would find? Nobody had any experience. What happened in these training sessions is that we got to know each other, and we were all as different as chalk from cheese. Many of us didn\u2019t know each other, and it was a way of getting to know each other, getting to know the people who were doing the training. We were absolutely green when we arrived in Egypt, and as we took the train from Port Said down to Cairo, there were men on horseback along the train shooting at us, just for fun. And, we were under the seats. You know, and when I think of it, I don\u2019t think we were really scared. Who expected to be shot at? You know, you\u2019re coming to do relief work. We were in a camp in Maadi, M-a- a-d-1, in Cairo for a while. We were allowed to read army records of what was happening, and that\u2019s when we really got to know what was happening in Germany. The British were brining in Yugoslavs from the coast of Dalmatia. There was one camp that held about 20,000 people, and there was another camp which we \u2014 we, the new units \u2014 were sent up to take care of on the Suez Canal, a place called Khataba, K-h-a-t-a-b-a, and when these people came in, they were emaciated. They had women who were breastfeeding children of four and two. Their breasts were like envelopes. They had suffered tremendous malnutrition. The British had taken them from Dalmatia to southern Italy, which was liberated, and then brought them into Egypt, but I must say the food that was provided for them was excellent. The sun didn\u2019t hurt. They lived in tents. There were very few men. They were mostly women and children, boys of 14 who had been in the army, who had lost limbs. And gradually they recovered. And my job at that time was to set up schools. Well, how do you set up schools for children when you have \u2014 there were two trained teachers, in fact, but no books, no pencils. We had learned some Yugoslav, and some of us were better at it than others. The army was wonderful. You could always get around the quartermaster. And I discovered that there were little white stones in the sand in the desert on which we were. So, we gathered the stones, and this how we taught them to write. We had \u2014 we were given a couple of tents, and then the ladies from Alexandria, as there are always ladies who want to do good, came to the camp with shoes, and most of these children hadn\u2019t worn shoes in their life, and they were afraid of these things. But we say to them, \u201cLook, these ladies really are very kind. They\u2019re also bringing clothing. While they are here, please wear the shoes. When they\u2019re gone, you can take them off.\u201d It was rather nice. I remember that instant."

When we told them what we needed, they began to send paper and pencils in, and what we did, we sent some people from our  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 9 camp over to the larger camp of refugees, where they were trained to be teachers. They were trained in one month to be schoolteachers and came back. They did a remarkable job. There was a war on, and everything was possible during the war. I think also because most \u2014 well, I think almost all of us in Britain had suffered the bombing and suffered the war. We could compromise, we could change things around, we learned very quickly to put up tents, we were sleeping four of us in a tent. I remember the dreadful latrines, which were seemed to me a mile long, and with hession, a sort of canvas in between, and you lived like this. We ate fairly well. I was never sick. Some people got dysentery. I didn\u2019t. Everything we ate on our own, which we weren\u2019t sure of, we put potassium tablets in the water to disinfect any nasty creatures, and we lived that way until October of \u201944."

In our units, by the way, there were many doctors who volunteered, women, and they immediately set up a hospital, but we got a measles epidemic, and in eight weeks, I think, we buried \u2014 no, six weeks, we buried over a hundred children, and that was dreadful because we lived within the hospital compound, and they crying of these women was absolutely dreadful, dreadful.

            "answer": "Oh, because southern Italy was liberated, and the allies were getting ready for the  liberation of Yugoslavia, which we had been trained to enter. Trained in the sense that we learned the language, we knew where we were going, we knew the kinds of jobs we would do, and because of the work we had done in Egypt, we were trained to take care of Yugoslavs who had gone through hell in this war. When we got to Italy, I happened to have been in the first unit of ten people who were sent over to Italy in preparation for going into Yugoslavia, and Teeter was approached by the British American armies. I\u2019m not quite sure of the chain of command. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do the job ourselves. Send us the goods.\u201d And they did. They did a very good job. So, here we were, the rest of the unit had come into Italy, we were sitting there. The Italians were very pleased to see us. The Italians were very nice actually. They were living under appalling conditions, having suffered German occupation and British occupation, and they would have liked us to have stayed, but we really had no job to do in Italy. And then we heard one organization working in southern Italy called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. They had, I think it was one representative at the time, a man called Reuben Resnick, working there, and we thought it would be an excellent idea if we could be seconded or loaned to this outfit so that we could help them. We had been given by the army, as had all the units, a three hundred weight truck, and a three ton truck. We all learned to drive that Dodge which was double the clutch. It was terrifying, but we could all drive them, and we had lots of supplies. And so in talking to the army, and the heads of the units did so, we asked if we could join the American organization and they said, \u201cCertainly, and take all your supplies with you.\u201d It was a lot of give and take in those days. They\u2019re much more difficult today. I don\u2019t know why. And so we loaned ourselves to the Joint. We went up to Rome to start with. Florence was still occupied, I remember, because as it was liberated, some of our boys took matzohs up to Florence for the first Passover of the liberation. I was helping to get ready the first legal transport going to Palestine after the war. I think it left on April the 12\", if my memory serves me, and I remember Moshe Shertock - I think, yes, that was his name \u2014 went with us, and I and somebody from the Joint, Israel, or Gaynor Israel Jacobson, worked on that transport and got that going, and it was very interesting because there were \u201cX\u201d number of certificates. People still had to have certificates from the British government to enter Palestine, and let\u2019s assume that we had 300, and they were all numbered. As people got on, the cards of those in front were taken and given to others at the back. So, although 300 were supposed to be on the ship, probably there were 400 or 500. I never did know how many got on, and that ship went off. That was one of the things we did. We also, which were helping people who would come in from Yugoslavia in small boats. I remember, the women would come in with hand grenades around their waists, great big burly women, very nice, but terrifying. And we met a lot of people, and then, of course, the Germans were still trying to bomb us, and I know, I remember very distinctly, when the Germans came over, of course, the Americans \u2014 the American civilians who hadn\u2019t seen any of this stuff, any of the bombing, would rush to the windows, and we Britishers would rush under the beds because we knew what shattered glass could do. It was an interesting time. When \u2014 yes, it was an interesting time, and as Italy began to be liberated, some of our people were going up north. When Greece was liberated, I was asked by the European director of the Joint  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 11 Distribution Committee, a very wonderful man called Dr. Joseph Schwartz. He was a rabbi by training, and really a very, very wonderful human being, one of my heroes. He asked me if, when Greece was liberated, I would go into Greece with their director, and of course, who would refuse? And, I was in Greece \u2014 well, the war was still on \u2014 when the camps were liberated, and people, I think, don\u2019t realize that so many thousands of people had been incarcerated in concentration camps and labor camps, and the army had no place for them once they were liberated, and the only thing they thought of doing was sending these people home. So, being in Greece at the time of the end of the war, suddenly the trains began to come in with these young men and women, many of them spitting blood from tuberculosis, no families. Out of a total, I think, of 70,000 Jews in Greece, there were about a total of 10,000 who survived all together, both in hiding and among those who came back, and I remember some of them having to sleep in the street. It was summer. It was June when they got back. They had to sleep in the street because there were no sanitarium \u2014 no sanitarium beds for them, and it was very, very difficult because none of them family. There were girls with no sisters or brothers. There were boys with no family. Occasionally, you\u2019d see an adult who son or daughters had been killed, and this organization, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, set up a hostel in Athens with a very wonderful local Greek lady called Mrs. Mossieri. I\u2019m sure her children are still alive. She was a go-getter, and she helped to set up this hostel. I went with Israel Jacobson to Palestine at that time to meet with Golda Meir and Mr. Sheretz Shatok (ph), and I can\u2019t think of the other gentleman\u2019s name at the moment, to talk to them about supplies that we would need and also people were beginning to go through Athens to Palestine illegally. It was very easy. Perez was next to Athens. They sent in some of their units of workers. There were people, ostensibly press agents. All the marvelous people, and one of the things that we asked at that time was that you slow down the movement because the British would come to what was known as a Hachshara, a camp, at Perez, and count the individuals there. And I remember the one day they came and they said, \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d And we said, \u201cThey\u2019ve gone home.\u201d That was nice."

I would see what was needed 1n that camp. For example, we had one of our unit members in charge of a search bureau which we set up immediately because the important thing was to try to reunite families. We had no baby clothes because once people \u2014 the camps were liberated and people began to lead normal lives, women began to menstruate again. They hadn\u2019t menstruated all through the war, and being normal human beings they began to get pregnant and have babies. We needed sanitary napkins for the women. We needed baby clothing. We needed special food for pregnant women. There were some older people who survived. We needed special food for them. We needed doctors. We needed more social workers. And one could assess this, and gradually these people came in to work in the camps. It was exciting in the sense that you felt you could do something positive, and then the most important thing, I think, at that time was the search bureaus that we set up. And they were interesting because, for example, you had to very quickly learn that the name \u201cSchwartz\u201d, for example, S-c-h-w- a-r-t-z, can be spelled 30 different ways, and how do you distinguish? How do you find Ivan Schwartz from Belgrade, for example? You then knew you had to have his birthdays, his parents\u2019 names, their birthdays, where they were born, and you set up a very good system internationally. The headquarters, at one point after Germany was liberated, was Arolsen in Germany. There was a big unit in London set up by the World Jewish Congress and there was a big unit also in New York, and I think they were right. The most important thing was to help people find family. This went on for years. It still goes on. People are still finding relatives, close relatives."

I had a mother and father and three  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 17 sisters and four brothers, and I managed to escape. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. My parents, I think, were taken to a camp. I think my brothers and sisters may have escaped.\u201d What we would do, we would send these lists of people who are asking for relatives to each office, and each office would contact the next office to see if they had any of these people registered with them. We did use the Red Cross, but we found we were more efficient, I must be honest, than the Red Cross. Firstly, the Red Cross took much longer than we did. We knew that time was of the essence. These lists were passed around, and we all got copies of these lists. So, if we were looking for your relatives, we could look and say, \u201cHey! Your aunt, we haven\u2019t found your parents yet, but your aunt is in Salzburg.\u201d And very often, of course, when these people came to our offices, all the walls had their names written on them, and one would write, \u201cI\u2019m Ivan Schwartz. I\u2019m going to Rome.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m Ivan Schwartz. I\u2019m going to Munich. You will find me. I will be with so-and-so.\u201d It was like the tom-toms working.

            "answer": "Yes, these were Greek Jews. The situation was worse because in \u2014 firstly, in Egypt, we had many volunteers working with the people who the British were bringing in from the coast of Dalmatia. In Greece, we were two foreigners, there was the head of the Joint Distribution Committee and I, and some local workers, and in Egypt, they hadn\u2019t been in concentration camp, and no matter how much people had suffered, they hadn\u2019t suffered the brutality, the inhumanity of the Germans in the sense of the people who came back from concentration camps had. We had girls who came back who had tattooed across their stomachs, \u201cNur fuer ofitserin\u201d \u201cOnly for officers\u201d. They were used in brothels. The boys, very many of them, had been castrated. So, in addition to all their suffering, in one sense, the suffering was even worse than others, and yet, none of them had families to come back to. There wasn\u2019t a mother and a father. If there was a brother, there was nobody else. If there was a sister, there was nobody else. There were no complete families left in Greece. As I mentioned earlier, I remember very clearly, the population among Jews in Greece had been 70,000 before the war, and after the war there were 10,000.

I remember, one came into the office once \u2014 it sounds funny at this point \u2014 but, again, he was going to shoot Israel Jacobson, and I sort of stood between, the brave one yet stupid, and he said, \u201cHey that\u2019s a Mauser.

They thought the different seals had different values, and we bought it from him, and I remember, we got a friend to row us out to the Aegian and we threw the gun into the water. That was just \u2014 I remember that particularly, because when I stood between them, this wrist was flicked out that way, and this one this way.

Well, I would have done anything this man asked me, and so I went up into Athens, but I knew nothing of American immigration law, and I must say, I sat down for four days with this American immigration law from 1924, I think it was, and then with the Truman Directive, and gradually began to get things together, and it didn\u2019t take too long. Firstly, here was something very positive. We were going to be able to help people to leave Austria \u2014 displaced persons and Austrian Jews. And the first problem we had was that those Jews from Austria who had returned to Vienna from camps were not considered displaced persons by the consuls, but the International Refugee Organization had registered them as displaced persons, which they were. They didn\u2019t have their homes. They didn\u2019t have their jobs. Some of their family members had been killed, and so, we set up a test case. When I say we, I was very brazen, I must confess, and I established a precedent case showing how this man \u2014 I won\u2019t give you his name, he lives in the States today \u2014 how this man had lost family, had lost his home, had come back, had no where to live, was being housed by the American voluntary agency, and essentially he was still a displaced person, and we won the case. So, he could get a visa and go to the United States. When this happened, we could put through other Austrian Jews. There weren\u2019t too many left, and get them visas, and then we could help the others to get visas. And the interesting thing was we began to work rather swiftly. My thought was firstly we must get young people out because the young people are the future of any community. Secondly, we must get all  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 32 those people out who have relatives who will help them. That meant they would not be a charge on the voluntary agency\u2019s funds, which really had to harness its money, and also it would give them back a normal life, and so these people began to move rather swiftly through the pipeline, and it worked very well until the first Displaced Persons Act, American Displaced Persons Act of 1948. This in a sense sounds like a mythical story, but I was in Vienna and some members of the Displaced Persons Commission, I'll think of their names in a moment \u2014 Carrousi (ph) and some other people, came into Vienna, I think it was on a Saturday, maybe it was a Friday, and said, \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re ready to issue visas under the Displaced Persons Act. Where are your job and housing assurances? On the basis of those, we can give visas.\u201d Frankly, I\u2019d never seen a job and housing assurance. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I knew we were going to have some, but we were waiting for our American agency to send the stuff over, and I said to these men, \u201cOur job and housing assurances are at the printers, at the Allianz gebaude,\u201d which 1s the office where we took all our mimeographing. If you would write one out for me, Ill go over there and get it mimeographed. I was lying. I\u2019d never seen one. They were very nice, these gentlemen. They wrote it out. I went over to the Allianz gebaude. I mimeographed about 50. I had all the cases which I knew were okay. I issued a job and housing assurance for, and these went to the consulate and these people gave them visas. I called Munich and told the director of immigration there what I had done and what the wording was on this thing so when these men eventually got to Salz \u2014 I beg your pardon \u2014 to Munich in a few days, they were ready. Now, our people began to get visas, and I must say within about ten days a cable came through to the director of the Joint in Austria, Harold Trobe, telling him that was Amy Zahl was doing was illegal and please stop her at once. And he called me on the phone and told me this, and so I went to the consulate, I picked up every Jewish case I could find whether we would have been working with them or not, issued them job and housing assurances, and then stopped. Now, what happened was as the ships began to take passengers to the States, and we were using army transports, there were a lot of Jews in the first ship \u2014 ship, one ship, two ships, about four ships, and the press in the United States, of course, \u201cOnly Jews are getting visas.\u201d There were lots of anti-Semitic comments in the press, and I\u2019m sure if you look at the press at that time, you'll find 1t was only because we were on the ball. What we did do, of course, was tell the other agencies what they needed and how to go about it. We didn\u2019t have a counsel of voluntary agencies in Vienna. We did when I got to Germany, but that was very interesting. I felt as though I was doing sort of some really dirty work, but we were helping people to get out."

I learned Yiddish, also, and I learned to speak with a Polish accent. There\u2019s a different accent if you\u2019re a Russian Jew or Lithuanian Jew. You have a softer accent. I would talk to them in German or in Yiddish about what they had to do, and why it was taking so long from their point of view, that there was no need to try and come, let\u2019s say, to the office in Vienna, which some of them would try to do or to go to Salzburg. We didn\u2019t have the staff to cope with large numbers, but what was happening and what we were doing and I think the fact that we kept them informed of what we were doing helped to stop any rioting that we might have had. I don\u2019t remember any rioting at all, actually. We had people who would be very irate and come in and bang the table and make all kinds of threats, but I think it helped having offices where, you may laugh at this, where we set up chairs where they could sit and wait, because when I first came in, there were no chairs for visitors. They lined up, and one by one they went in and stood by a desk. Well, this whole thing of dignity which I\u2019d learned at a very early age. People \u2014 you don\u2019t give them dignity by making them stand and you sit. I remember, what we did in Vienna and I did it again in Germany. We got a great big urn, and made coffee, and the nicest person I could find, usually a nice Hungarian boy, I would put in charge of the waiting room, and he\u2019d offer people coffee. They were unused to this. A lot of people wouldn\u2019t drink our coffee because they were ultra-orthodox, but other people would, and we would have newspapers in the office, and as I told you, they\u2019d go along the walls scribbling their names and where they were going to or leaving notes with somebody and they\u2019d meet each other. It became a meeting place. It worked. It worked. Sometimes, they had to wait a long time in order to get seen because we didn\u2019t have colossal staff. The work was tedious. For the consuls, you had to have everything in order, and we weren\u2019t only working on American immigration. We were working on immigration to Palestine. No, we weren\u2019t doing the Palestine immigration now. Palestine  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 36 was being handled by the Jewish agency. We were not working on Palestine. That\u2019s an error. We were working on South America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the paperwork was very slow, but people did begin to move out. But the Truman Directive was wonderful because, for the first time, numbers of people began to leave, numbers, and the Rothschild Hospital, which was housing so many of these people, began gradually to get \u2014 to lessen in number its occupants. But it was hard work."

This happened occasionally and somebody was absolutely heartbroken when you knew that they were genuine and they were refused entry by the INS having gone through all the medicals and all the other checks, and had been given visas and had written to relatives that they were coming.

Those were hotels where somebody came for an hour, and the rooms were very tiny, and that, I found, very difficult to live with, and so I got myself a billet in a private home of some Austrians and had at least a room and a bathroom that I could move around in to myself, and it was a bit further out from the center. So, it was fairly pleasant. But they had no heating and I had to supply coal to heat my room. But it wasn\u2019t bad.

            "question": "But, you had \u2014 you administered a number of offices?",
            "answer": "Yes, this was the Viennese office, which I worked in as well as administrating. Then I administered the office in Salzburg, the one in Linz, which was the other side of the Russian zone, and the one in the French zone in Innsbruck, and then we had representatives in all the displaced persons camps because we would go out to them to save people having to travel to Vienna, which they couldn\u2019t do unless they had permits to go through the Russian zone, and that, nobody was keen to do at this time. We would go into the camps, and tell them things which were necessary for them to know, or collect papers, or bring them papers for signature. It was a bit of an awkward program, although it worked very well. Or they could go into Salzburg, where there papers were held. It was not an easy situation actually because we were always worried that there might be Russians around trying to pick up people because sometimes we had Russian army officers who were Jewish. For example, a woman came to me one day dressed almost in rags with dyed hair looking very ugly, and she said her husband and daughter were in Palestine. She was a doctor in the Russian army, and there was a certificate for Palestine for her at the British consulate, could we help her? Well, the first thing you think 1s, \u201cA ha! She\u2019s a spy. She wants to see what we\u2019re doing.\u201d And I took all her particulars and I went across to the British consulate, and sure enough there was a certificate, but that wasn\u2019t enough as far as I was concerned. I contacted friends who were working with the Jewish agency for Palestine, told them the story, and asked them to check in Palestine that she did indeed have a husband and a daughter there, because one never knew how honest these people were. There were many ways by which you could trick somebody, and the answer eventually came back that yes, her husband and daughter were there and they confirmed her story. Now, how was I to get her out? She had to come at times when very few people were around. I had to try and do everything so that she wouldn\u2019t be seen, and eventually I got her certificate, and how to send her to the airport which was in the Russian zone? And the only way to do it was to take her myself, and don\u2019t think I wasn\u2019t scared. I\u2019m not so brave, but she sat in the car with me and we handed in her papers, and my propesk, my permit to go into the Russian zone, and we put her on a plane. And there were others. I had a young woman who was working at the Polish consulate, who had a brother in Canada. My goodness, my memory\u2019s going back, and she said she had a visa to go to Canada, and again, I was suspicious, and checked her out in the same way. I checked through the consulate and then I checked with the agency, the Jewish agency working in Montreal, and they confirmed her story, and she told the Poles at that time she was going on vacation, and off she went to Canada. It was tricky doing this because you were always suspicious that perhaps these people were not genuine, and that you might be picked up yourself on the street because people were being picked up, particularly by the Russians. People would be walking along and suddenly a car would stop, and like a  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 41 gangster film, people would be whisked off and not seen again. It never happened to any of us. I\u2019m just adding drama to the story, I guess."

So, if we were suspicious, we could ask the doctor or somebody to examine him, but I\u2019m sure Germans got through as Jewish displaced persons and probably lived a life as Jews.

            "question": "You do, but you won\u2019t tell right? So, what happened in 1948? You then got -",
            "answer": "Oh, in 1948, this was an interesting year. The Americans passed the Displaced Persons Act, the first one where displaced persons if they had job and housing assurances, could get visas for the United States. It didn\u2019t depend on which country they had lived. In other words, it wasn\u2019t a quota system. And this was fascinating because, one day, I don\u2019t know if it was a Friday or a Saturday, we were in the office \u2014 I must say we didn\u2019t know whether it was Monday or Tuesday or Saturday or Sunday when we worked \u2014 Mr. Gruzo and Henry Rosenfeld and some others from the Displaced Persons Commission in Washington appeared in my office, charming gentleman. They were ready to issue visas under the Displaced Persons Act. Well, I assure you that none of the voluntary agency personnel of all the agencies knew the first thing about what we were supposed to have had, but they were ready to issue visas. And so, I said to them, \u201cUnfortunately, my job and housing assurances are at the printers, but if you\u2019d write one out for me. I'll take it over to the allianz gebaude,\u201d which was the American building where they had mimeograph machines, \u201cIll get some printed out, and you can start work.\u201d And so they were very nice gentlemen. They wrote it down. I took it over, and came back with 50 or 60, and we took the cases in my office and everyone they thought was eligible, I gave a job and housing assurance to, and pumps!, a few days later they were issuing the visas. The next day, or perhaps that evening, I called our Munich office of the American Joint and told the man who was director there what we were doing and gave him the wording so that when these people arrived in Munich, they would be ready, and quite a number of people got visas. In about ten days, a message came through from the United States from the United Service for New Americans, which was our cooperating agency. They contacted all the communities in the United States where there were relatives and actually arranged the immigration of relatives to relatives or of people without relatives to people who were offering them jobs and housing. They were very efficient. But they cabled our Paris office saying, \u201cWhat Amy Zahl is doing is illegal. Tell her to stop immediately.\u201d And Harold Trobe who was director of the joint operation in Austria called me and said, \u201cAmy, I\u2019ve had this cable.\u201d And I said, \u201cHmm, very interesting. We will stop.\u201d And, of course, what I did, I went into the American Consulate where they were very cooperative, let me put it that way, it was a very nice consul. Sometimes the consuls were not at all cooperative. In times when life was a stake before the war, the consuls were not very cooperative, but these people were very helpful. I looked through all the Jewish cases I could find whether they were registered with the Joint Distribution Committee or with HIAS (ph), or not registered with an agency, and gave them all job and housing assurances, and then I stopped. Now, what happened as a result was these people got  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 46 visas. They were sent up to Bremen, and they were on the ships going to the States in larger numbers than non-Jews sponsored by non-Jewish agencies because they hadn\u2019t had this first encounter with the Displaced Persons Commission, and the press in New York was rather anti-Semitic, you know, \u201conly Jews are getting visas.\u201d You can look up the press at the time and see these notices. What we did, of course, was to tell the Christian agencies what we had done, told them what the wording was so they could get started, but I think we had more support from our agency than they had from theirs. I know when it came to children, for example, I was always horrified both when I was in Austria and later in Germany to find children \u2014 and, when I say children, I mean youngsters under 18 \u2014 still either in hostels or in camps. Although the American \u2014 I\u2019ve got the name of the agency, the refugee agency taking care of orphans \u2014 was working, they were working very slowly, and I just couldn\u2019t bear the thought that there were kids without families still sitting in Austria and this is what? 18 months after the war ended. And so, what we would do is take these children and take them away from the other agency, and get them visas to go to the States. It was exciting in that you thought you were helping people, and because we could work so efficiently, we saw the results in a very short time. When I finished the first batch in Austria, Dr. Schwartz came to me again in the October of 46, and said would I go into Germany and take over the operation there? With working very successfully in Austria and I had very good assistance working in the Vienna office. Everybody was strained. I always worked as though I was leaving tomorrow. It was a good way to work because it meant if I wanted to take time off, the office would function, the files would be working, and I felt that none of us should try to make ourselves indispensable. We, after all, were working to save people\u2019s lives. I always felt that. And so, on October the 28\", 1948, I came up into Munich, which was the head office for the German operation, and there was chaos. The staff there were on strike. About 200 letters a day were coming in from the States because the American operations, as I mentioned earlier, were very efficient, and there was nobody working. They were on strike. They wanted better pay. I was horrified. I came into the office and a young woman, an American, Gladys Roth, was running the office at that time, and I wanted her to take over the volkcaserna (ph), where people went in order to get processed for America. She was a very efficient worker, very sympathetic, spoke excellent Hungarian, spoke some German, and was a good worker. She too felt you had to help these people to get out \u2014 a wonderful sense of humor, by the way. She was a lifesaver. And I called these people together who were on strike, and I said I would look into their salary claims, but not unless they came back to work because what they were doing was stopping people leaving and they themselves were being stopped from leaving. So, this doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And I said, \u201cIll expect you all in the office tomorrow morning.\u201d I went to the office in the morning and there was some staff, and the next morning there were a few more, and I let word out that if the rest didn\u2019t come back to work by the end of the week I was going to employ new people. They were all back. There were some troublemakers. For example, the way they had been operating was if people had to go to Paris to pick up transit visas, they would hire coaches on the trains, and two of the boys who worked in the office would go on the train to Paris. Well, you know what this leaves them open to. They could take cigarettes. They could do bribes. I don\u2019t know what they did, but I knew  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 47 this had to stop, and I let it go on for a little while. You don\u2019t change things immediately, and one day I said, \u201cYou know, we have to let these people really go out on their own so that they face the world for the first time. So, let\u2019s try one train without you on it.\u201d Well, no, they found a thousand reasons, but I was very firm and the first train went off, and was successful. And then I announced that no more would we have to accompany these people. That was my way of handling that, and then in December, they decided to go on strike again. I was 1n trouble because I didn\u2019t know what I could offer. Sam Haber was running the operation. He was a tough guy to cope with, and I said I would see them the next day, and talk to them. I came to the office, and there was not a soul 1n sight. And I felt, \u201cI have failed.\u201d I was so horrified, and what could I do, and my office was on the third floor of this building, and I went up to the office and I opened the door and there was a great big shout, \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d I had forgotten it was my birthday, and they were all up there. I wept. I was so astounded to find them all there, and friends, obviously they were now my friends. I\u2019ve still got the birthday card they made me out of a manila folder, that big and they\u2019d all signed it, and that was wonderful. From then on, we got along very well. The men who had accompanied the people to Paris, I helped to immigrate very quickly. I thought that was the best thing for them. And I tried not to employ people who would have to immigrate now. The Czechs \u2014 you may not know this historically, you may know it better than I \u2014 had thrown out the volksdeutsch, and there were some lovely young people amongst those who came into Germany who, through no fault of their own, were thrown out as revenge, and I employed some of these girls. I made sure they hadn\u2019t been members of the BDM, the Bund Deutscher Mddel, and by the way, it was easy to check it because the Germans were so methodical, they had lists. So, I employed these people, but then the rabbis were insulted. I was employing non-Jews when Jews needed jobs, and I met with them, and I said, \u201cMy job is to get the Jews out of here who don\u2019t belong here, and the only way I can do that is to employ non-Jews who are clean and let the others get out.\u201d Some of these girls married Jewish boys. They were lovely girls, and they worked very efficiently, but these were some of the hurdles one had to cope with. The rabbis were always watching that we did the right thing. For example, I had permission to send what we called \u201chighly pregnant women\u201d, women in their eighth month, by air to the States because if they couldn\u2019t leave and they had babies, they couldn\u2019t go on these cargo \u2014 not cargo, these military ships and the visa might expire. It was only good for four months. I had an arrangement with Air France. For every ten people I put on a plane, I got one free seat. And so these women would come to me, you know, \u201cI\u2019m in my ninth month.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in my eighth month.\u201d And I got to the stage when I could look at a woman, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re seven and a half months pregnant. You have time.\u201d It was very funny because we played jokes together. I\u2019m just remembering this. We sent a lot of people by air. Now, some of the ships sailed on a Saturday and the Orthodox Jews would not sail on Saturday. Some of the planes went on Friday evening. We made arrangements with the captains of the planes and the captains of the ships. On the planes, the passengers were allowed to embark before the Sabbath came in, therefore it was their home. They were allowed to get onto the ship the day before the Sabbath, so that this already was their home, and there was no problem. But, you had to think of all kinds of things to stop people from staying behind. Occasionally, you\u2019d have somebody  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 48 who was having a pair of trousers made, and therefore he couldn\u2019t leave. It wasn\u2019t that he was having trousers made. In a sense, a lot of these people were scared to leave. I think that\u2019s what I thought about them, and so I would call his tailor and if he was having trousers made, I used to tell him, \u201c\u201cYou have to have them by tonight because otherwise he\u2019s going to lose his visa.\u201d The tailors were usually pretty good. They were either displaced pers- mostly displaced persons or Germans, and they knew what was happening and they would finish the pants, and these people would go on. I only once met a man in New York when I was there who at some kind of gathering, he looked at me and said, \u201cZie haben mae swandon heir sukammen.\u201d (ph) He was a German Jew who said I forced him to come to America, and his wife said, \u201cIgnore him.\u201d But, he was a man who was having pants made. It was fascinating working with those people. People had all kinds of excuses for not going, and I really felt they were scared. After all, some of them were coming to relatives they haven\u2019t seen since before the war or they had never seen. A mother\u2019s relative who had come a generation ago. I can understand it. I would be horrified to have to go to a relative who was going to support me who I didn\u2019t know, or my mother had told me stories they didn\u2019t like. It was fascinating, fascinating, but you had to get \u2014 firstly, you had to get these people out of Germany. They were not wanted in Germany. There was no future for them in Germany. And secondly, one knew that once they got to the States, they could begin to rebuild for themselves and the new children they had. It was fortunate that so many of them did have children because this gave them a future. They were concerned for their children, and that was one of the reasons for leaving. We also had situations where non-Jews had helped Jews in hiding, and I remember Andre Bulova\u2019s sister, Bulova watch company, his sister was a Mrs. Godem (ph) came to see me, and for some reason, she liked me. She said, \u201cDo you have people you would like to help and you can\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, P\u2019ve got heads of families who are non-Jews.\u201d And we essentially helped families where the head of the family was a Jew because they would fit into a new community. She said, \u201cI will give you affidavits worth a million dollars each, and you send them to my brother and we will find jobs for them.\u201d And there was one man who had hidden his wife through the war, and he did beautiful work, enamel on silver, and he brought in several \u2014 I shall never forget this \u2014 several small dishes in a way to show me of work he did. It was all very beautiful, and when I told Mrs. Godem, because she would come back and forth, she said, \u201c\u201cHe can do watch covers. My brother would be very pleased to see him.\u201d And this man said to me, \u201cWhich one do you like the best?\u201d Well, I knew he was saying to me, \u201cI will give you that one.\u201d I said, \u201cThey\u2019re all beautiful.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t admire any, and the only gift I ever have or had from a survivor or from a refugee was a dish he sent to me. He knew I wouldn\u2019t take it. We allowed them to bring flowers to the office, and sometimes it looked like a mortuary, there were so many flowers, but gifts were forbidden because gifts lead to bribes. But I have at home still this lovely tray he gave me. It\u2019s a dish about six inches in diameter, St. George and the Dragon. I think he must have made it for me. And, they did very well in the States. We had some wonderful people, we really did, who immigrated to the States, and America is richer for them. It really is. The operation in Germany went quite successfully, I would say, because we got all the offices to work in the same fashion. We set up some of the filing systems. When we had people from Austria who came into  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 49 Germany, we had the same system for handing them. There was one case of a young man who I sent ostensibly to the States via Germany. His name was Miklaus Rezmowitz. He was Hungarian. I had found him on the streets in Vienna, and what I did, I got the Joint office to set up a small hostel for me where if I put kids there, they had a whole sheet to themselves on the bed, and I tried to find them jobs, and I tried to get them out of the country as soon as possible. And I sent Mickey through Germany to the States. When I came to Germany 18 months later, somebody told me \u2014 because there always was a grapevine \u2014 that Mickey was working in a garage in Munich and I was horrified. This sweet little boy, to me he was a baby. And I got him to come to my office and he told me when he got to Munich, for some reason something happened and the visa wasn\u2019t picked up and nobody helped him, and he didn\u2019t want to write and tell me because I\u2019d been so kind to him, and so he let his visa lapse. Well, I started immediately to work on his visa, and discovered he had a brother in Sweden. I may have mentioned to you that even to this day, people are finding relatives. His brother had escaped to Sweden and was there, and I decided when I eventually got Mickey\u2019s visa, I would bring the brother in from Sweden. Eventually, we got a visa for Mickey, and I got his brother to come and we put him up in our apartment \u2014 I was sharing an apartment with three, two other girls, and the next morning we brought the brother to the office \u2014 I\u2019ve got pictures of him \u2014 and where was Mickey? He was no where to be found. He was out philandering somewhere, and when I brought him to the office, and he met his brother for the first time since they were both taken away, you can imagine the scene. It was wonderful. I then met Mickey again in New York, and he told me he was so appreciative of what America did for him, he was joining the army. It was the Korean war, and I\u2019ve never heard from him since. So, I\u2019m going to the museum in Washington tomorrow to see if I, hopefully, don\u2019t find him on the list that I should look at. But there were some wonderful stories. As I say, ve got pictures of these two brothers in my office. There were some wonderful stories, and the older men I employed in the office, some of them had come back from Shanghai, took care of these youngsters for me, and behaved like fathers, you know, made sure they were in on time. It just was a very nice atmosphere in that place and made it easy to work."

            "answer": "A much, much bigger. Most of the displaced persons in Germany were in the American zone of Germany. It was a much bigger operation. I can tell you some interesting stories of things that happened because people think the camps were liberated and suddenly there were no more camps, but there were the displaced persons camps, and let\u2019s say people wanted to get to Canada, but how? They were ineligible for the United States because they didn\u2019t fit in with the criterion which was necessary to immigrate to the United States, and Canada would be offering a scheme to bring in tailors, or furriers. Well, the ORT organization was wonderful in Germany. We got doctors and lawyers to train as furriers. They could operate the same machines and they passed the exam, and came to Canada, and they worked as doctors and as lawyers. They took their exams again, and they were of benefit to Canada. Canada was foolish in many instances because they were looking for brawn. They weren\u2019t looking for brain. America was much more  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 50 aware of what was available because of the kinds of refugees they had taken in at the beginning or before the war, and so America got all kinds, but Canada took a long time to wake up. But what we would do again \u2014 we wanted it to help these people get out and if all they were taken was furriers, well you train these people as furriers, and they came to Canada. I don\u2019t think the consuls knew. I\u2019m sure that the people in Canada knew what we were doing, but you know, you\u2019d get out 25 families at a time. It was wonderful."

There was a letter written by Kaufman who was the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine who apparently visited the DP camps, and wrote, whether rightly or wrongly, that these young women who were having babies don\u2019t know how to be mothers, we have to send women here to train these young women because these babies are coming and they don\u2019t know what to do or they don\u2019t even want to. Did you find in the DP camps where you were visiting that this was not an easy time?",

Secondly, this gentleman wasn\u2019t aware, perhaps, that these young women had lost their mothers who normally would\u2019 ve helped them through this period, and there were no older women around who\u2019d had babies. They had been killed off. But they soon learned. These women had mother\u2019s instinct. They were so thrilled to have babies, to start again. The men who were their husbands, because there was no license there, there weren\u2019t women who weren\u2019t married having babies. These were young women who were married and having children, starting a life again, starting a family again. They were very careful. I think they all cared. Some of them probably were better than others, but even in our society, we have women who are better than others in rearing children. But it was wonderful for us when they first started to get pregnant, because while they were incarcerated or in hiding, most women didn\u2019t even menstruate. They only started to menstruate again when they were free. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon how nature takes care of itself."

She would have had wonderful stories to tell. She did a tremendous job and helped a tremendous number of people. We had some very fine people working with us. There was another woman who came up from South Africa, another volunteer. South Africa also had volunteers. A woman called Hannah Kisch who worked in my office in Munich who did a beautiful job. She was from Latvia and spoke beautiful Yiddish, and people loved her. She did a very good job, and despite the fact that she was rather an emotional woman, was able to forget this, and when she had to bawl somebody out because they\u2019d done something that wasn\u2019t good, she could do it in the kind of Yiddish that they understood. She was a lovely woman. We did have some wonderful women working with us, and some men, but mostly they were women. They did a tremendous job."

The police were wonderful at the Brenna (ph) Pass. The Italians got to know me, and they would tell me, \u201cThe train\u2019s going to be a half hour, three-quarters of an hour late. Why don\u2019t you go to bed, and when we know the train\u2019s coming, we\u2019ll wake you?\u201d And, so I\u2019d go to the hotel, sometimes the train was an hour late, and somehow I'd hear the police shouting up at me or banging on the door, and I\u2019d get up. I had all the passports for these people, couldn\u2019t give passports out, and I would accompany them down to Genoa, and the catabaneri (ph) in Genoa were very good. They\u2019d invite me down to the docks, make sure that I had somebody with me, and take me to the hotel and make sure that I had my room with a side doors locked, because many hotels had rooms adjoining with doors that were unlocked. They always made sure that the doors were locked before they would allow me into the hotels. They were very nice people. I was in Genoa maybe every three or four weeks. There was a wonderful  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 56 woman working for the Joint there called Elia Eliaskovitch her name was. She had come to Italy to study Anthropology before the war, got stuck there, and the catabaneri gave her a certificate to say that she was a Catholic. She survived all through the war, Elka Eliaskovitch. I lost touch with her, but she knew every consul in Genoa, and she would just take me. We would get the visas that we needed and then she would take me down to the shipping agents because shipping was very difficult to get, and she would always manage to get shipping. She was a wonderful woman. She landed up I think in California, but I never heard from her after she left. We did have some wonderful characters working in this total program."

That gave the first ray of hope to people that they might get to the United States, but when they passed the DP Act, this was the first time, really, that people could come to the United States outside of a quota number and on the basis of a job and housing assurance which somebody perhaps they didn\u2019t know had given them. Whereas, before affidavits were generally given by close relatives who undertook, of course, to ensure that they would not be come a charge on public funds. This was a totally different concept, and the Truman government at the time really is to be congratulated in having shown a humanitarian aspect of US immigration law which until then had really kept people out."

This also was important. It meant that people were given a choice to an extent and how often had these people been given a choice after the war? They came out of the camps or if they were Polish Jews who had fled into Russia and worked in the mines, and had gone back to the Poland, what choices had they had? It might interest you, by the way, to know that among the people we took care of, the first complete Jewish families I found after the war were the Polish Jews who had fled to Russia when the Germans marched in. And, although they\u2019d suffered tremendous hardship, we had husbands and wives and children together. It was very interesting to see this. As I said, they had \u2014 many of them had suffered.

You have to try and imagine what it was like to be in Germany after the war when either you were a survivor of a camp \u2014 and there weren\u2019t too many remember \u2014 you were somebody who had been encouraged to leave Poland, firstly because the Poles were still anti- Semitic. There had been pogroms in 1946 in Kielce, when Jews were killed again. You were encouraged to leave because you hoped for a better life somewhere else. You didn\u2019t want to be among the people you had been with, and everybody in a sense was concerned for himself or herself. And you have to imagine also in these camps there was a total lack of privacy for people. They were sleeping in nissen (ph) huts. There was curtain in  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 58 between families to give them some sort of privacy, but very little because it didn\u2019t stop voices carrying.

It was a very, very tough time for these people.

There were no, obviously, there were no washing machines, but what kind of laundry facilities there were, what kind of facilities there were for the Orthodox Jews.

            "answer": "He was an interesting character. Again, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who was the European Director of the JDC, came to me and told me really a fantastic story of a man whom a whole group of survivors in Paris had just given a banquet. Who was this man? His name was Oscar Schindler, and I really knew nothing about him at that time. And Dr. Schwartz told me that Oscar Schindler had saved the lives of at least 1,200 Jews by having them work in his factory in Poland, and Oscar Schindler had come back to Germany, had gone to Frankfurt. I think he had tried to set up a concrete factory, and was not successful. It\u2019s interesting, this fantastic character didn\u2019t do very well. The Joint was helping to support him at this time because they were so astounded by his efforts to save people who essentially were not of his own kind. They were Jews; he was a Catholic. He was a  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 59 member of the Nazi party, as most Germans were. And the fact that he had helped these people, they were ready to do anything they could to help him. So, Dr. Schwartz said to me, \u201cAmy, you know the ropes. He will come to you. Perhaps he won\u2019t even come alone. He may come with other people. I want you to try and send him wherever he wants to go.\u201d Well, Oscar Schindler appeared in my office one day with his wife and two young Jewish couples, and I sort of couldn\u2019t get the hang of what the relationship was, and they explained to me in Yiddish that they always protected him because he looked like any other German Nazi. He had blue eyes and blonde hair, and was very fair, obviously, and they were afraid if he came to my office, which was in the Jewish quarter of Munich, he might be set upon. There were a lot of belligerent Jews at that time. Oscar, as I said, came, and explained to me that what he really wanted to do was to set up a mink farm. Now, what he knew about mink farming, I had no idea, but 1t wasn\u2019t mine to question. And the place he wanted to do it was in the Argentine. The Argentine, I knew the Argentine consuls. I could get a visa for Oscar and his wife, no problem. They were Catholics. But, he said also, he would not go unless the two couples with him also got visas because they were like family to him, and they felt he was family to them. He\u2019d saved their lives, and they were never going to forget this. Well, I set about trying to get the visas. As I say, it was not too difficult for Oscar and his wife. How to get visas for the two couples with him \u2014 on the application form for a Argentine visa, they asked religion. They did on many applications at that time, asked the religion of the applicant, but it didn\u2019t say explain anything. It didn\u2019t say, for example, if somebody was Orthodox, were they Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Jewish Orthodox, \u201cA ha!\u201d I thought. I put Orthodox, and it was no problem. I got the visas, and eventually they went to the States. I\u2019m sorry, they went to the Argentine, but they were lovely people, all of them. Oscar was very soft voiced, very pleasant. Who could imagine that this man \u2014 he was diminutive, he wasn\u2019t very tall \u2014 had the courage to do the kinds of things he did? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the film \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u2019, but a lot of that \u2014 the story in that film \u2014 is true. He was an extraordinary man to deal with, and in retrospect, quite a privilege to have met him. It was interesting that we were so busy trying to help people that it never occurred to me that here was somebody who was very, very special."

I think there\u2019s one part of the film where he goes into the basement to get wine, I think, it is Gert\u2019s basement and the young lady who works for him, a Jewish prisoner, who Gert is very nasty to, is down there and Oscar, if you remember the film, leans towards her and she thinks he\u2019s going to kiss her. And he pats her on the shoulder. He said, \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t going to kiss you. I was going to kiss you actually only on the forehead, but to tell you you will be all right. I will take care of you.\u201d Now, when you think of this man, he could\u2019ve abused this girl. He could\u2019ve abused any of the Jewish women in his care. He could\u2019ve raped them if he had to. He could\u2019ve done anything with them because they owed their lives to him. He didn\u2019t touch one of them. Although in the film, he is shown as being a womanizer, it helps to sell a film. Let\u2019s face it, and he may have been a womanizer, but the important thing about Oscar Schindler is he didn\u2019t touch one of the prisoners. I think this tells you essentially the character of this man."

I had no home in England, anyway, and I thought I would come to the States. I had friends in the States, Gladys Roth, with whom I had worked invited me also to come and stay with her while she was on leave, and so I thought that was a good idea.

Would I go down to Brazil and sort the situation out? Foolishly, I said yes. The Brazilian community that I dealt with, largely was the refugee community. There were about 20,000 former refugees living in San Paulo, most of them very, very fine people. The people who had been sent in when the displaced persons camps were closing were difficult people, let me put it that way. Some of them were mentally ill. Some of them should never have been sent. Some of them had no desire to be there. It was a very, very difficult situation. I was physically attacked down there for a change.

I must say, and I'll confess now that one or two who were Germans who didn\u2019t know what they were letting themselves in for I sent back to Germany. One or two of them, I managed to get into Canada. And we set up a small loans committee so that a lot of these men could become hawkers. They bought goods on credit, and went to outlying villages just as the original Strausses did in the United States. Some of them became very wealthy, and they calmed down. Some of them were pretty awful people, and as with all groups, there was lovely people among them. It was a very tough job. I stayed in Brazil for nine months. It was a tough assignment, a very tough assignment. When I came back to New York, and the British asked me \u2014 called me and said would I come to England? Because the British government was now allowing what they called hardcore cases to come into England. Hardcore cases for the British were families where the head of the family could not maintain his family either because of physical illness or even that they might be mentally disturbed, and so I went to England, and went into Austria, Germany, and Italy again to choose hardcore cases to come to England. They were interesting, some of these people. I had one young man who had been shot through the shoulder and had no profession. We brought him to England. He was supposed to have had TB and be cured, but when we got him to England, we discovered he still had TB, and the British were not really taking in TB cases. They had enough illnesses of their own, and so eventually, I took this man who behaved as though he were mentally ill while he was England, eventually I took him back to Germany. We flew, and it was quite surprising. As we got off the plane, you never would have known that he had behavior other than normal behavior. When they x- rayed him, he showed no signs of TB. I\u2019m sure they thought the British were trying to get rid of him. He was quite an extraordinary case. I think he couldn\u2019t face being outside the territory in which he was captured. He was one of the strange cases. Others were families with several sons and daughters. Some of them Orthodox Jews who made a very good adjustment to living in England. We moved them into areas where there were Orthodox Jews. The Jewish Refugees Committee did a very good job on those people, and I remember another young \u2014 not a young couple, but a young man with older parents who the British brought in, and had him trained as a surveyor. He had no college education, but like many people in England, you could go into a profession and train on the job, and he did very well and his parents adjusted very well. Those families on the whole, except for this young man, who was very sad, were a success. And then, of course, I came back to the States. I became, I suppose, a cosmopolitan in a way in that I felt at home nowhere. I\u2019d worked for so long with displaced persons, in a sense, it was the only thing I knew. But after coming to the States, one of my friends convinced me I ought to work with the National Council of Jewish Women, their headquarters in New York. And I went to see them, and I must say they were very anxious to get me. I don\u2019t know why, perhaps my experience meant something to them. And I did work for them for \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think how long \u2014 several years, until the wanderlust got me again, and I decided together with a  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 64 friend who was a published author that we\u2019d go off to China and see what the role of women was in the new China. I didn\u2019t realize we wouldn\u2019t get visas, but I gave up my job. My friend got an advance on a book about China. She was already, as I say, a published author, and we landed in Tokyo \u2014 or rather, I landed in Tokyo. She was coming later by ship. I flew in. And the first night that I was in the Frank Lloyd Wright Imperial Hotel, it was a very interesting building. Everything was much too big for me. Everything was high, and the first night I was there, I met charming gentleman in the smorgasbord restaurant who eventually became my husband. We got married in London because my family couldn\u2019t think that somebody hat at last got me to say yes, and I ended up on the prairie in Illinois, on the flat, flat prairie, which I found devastating, absolutely devastating. Nobody knew me. Nobody knew of the work that I had done. Nobody was interested, and I decided, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m going to be stuck here\u201d because David was a lovely, lovely man, \u201cI\u2019m going to do something. I\u2019Il go back to school,\u201d which I had tried to do before I left England. I had gone to university in the evening, but of course couldn\u2019t continue because of the Blitz and things like that, and then I went overseas. I said to myself, \u201cPll get my degree here.\u201d And in the time it normally takes a student not having been in school for a thousand years, I maintain a straight average \u2014 a straight-A average \u2014 got my undergraduate degree, got a Master\u2019s degree, and then decided I would do what I always want to do and that was to get a PhD at the London School of Economics, and David thought that was a splendid idea. He was very kind, and I came to London again. The semester was ten weeks. We had three semesters a year, and I had to be there for two years. I managed to skip one while we went on sabbatical to Australia, which is another story, meeting people I\u2019d sent there as refugees, and came back to the States, finished my dissertation, and in 1975, received my PhD from the London School of Economics. And then I decided what one really had to do was to tell this story of what happened during and after the war because, as I say, nobody ever asked. Nobody seemed to be interested. There was one professor at University of Illinois. His name was Winton Solberg. He was an intellectual history, and he asked me to write a course on the Holocaust. I thought this was going to be a great opportunity. I wrote the course, but I was a woman, and the history department wasn\u2019t about to make funding available for me to teach the course. But, women\u2019s movement was beginning to get going, and Joan Huber, who was head of the department of sociology, said to me, \u201cAmy, you can teach that course in our department.\u201d I have to go back and bit and tell you that I had competed for a job as an assistant to the vice president for academic affairs for the university, and there were two positions going. There were 77 applicants, and Edith Terwilliger and I got those positions. The former Vice President, P.T. Yankwich, now lives in Washington, as a matter of fact. So, it was very interesting working for this man. He was very bright. He was an intellectual, and he gave me time off to teach the course, and since I got paid for teaching the course, it meant I could employ a graduate assistant and pay her that money, so she had money during the semester. I gave the course over three or four semesters. It was fascinating because the room which I was assigned filled very quickly, and the computer cut us off, and I found that the students taking the course were children from all ends, or both ends, of the Jewish spectrum. They were children of strictly Orthodox parents, and children of non-Orthodox parents. They were children of survivors. They  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 65 were children of Polish immigrants who\u2019d come after the war, and one didn\u2019t know what their parents had done during the war, and all of them were interesting because, if I told them, for example, the story of a pastor who had saved some Jews, they wanted proof, and my xeroxing bill was tremendous. I always brought evidence of anything I told them that was positive about non-Jews who\u2019d helped Jews, and I used to say, \u201cThere were good Germans. There were good Poles. There just weren\u2019t enough of them.\u201d They were interesting groups of students because, as I discovered, those whose parents were survivors, they told me their parents told them nothing. And I would tell them, \u201cPerhaps you can tell them something of what you\u2019ve learned in the class and see what their reaction is. Don\u2019t push them, but gently try to get their stories from them because it 1s still so painful for them \u2014 for them to tell you these stories.\u201d They were very interesting students, and I kept in touch with them for a long time."

            "question": "British Fund-  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 66",
            "answer": "Central British Fund for World Jewish Relief called me one day because she knew of my relationship to the organization. She said they had found a tremendous stack of files in one of the garages at one of the nursing homes, rather, one of the homes for the aged for former refugees. Would I come and look at it? She knew that I came into England fairly often because I did have brothers and sisters there. And so I came and looked at the stack and was amazed. There were a tremendous number of case histories on individuals. They were files on children who\u2019d been brought out from Austria and Germany on kinder transports. There were minutes of meetings. And I said to this woman, Ava Mitchell, \u201cYou have a treasure trove here. You\u2019ve got the archives of your agency. Nobody knows their story.\u201d And she originally had been a refugee, by the way. She said, \u201c\u201cWould you put it together for us?\u201d Well, I wasn\u2019t an archivist, and I knew that the agency would never have the money to employ an archivist. We have to remember that after the war, Britain was still very poor. I said I thought I\u2019d like to do this. So, I packed my bags and came to London. They gave me a staff. Somebody had given them some money so that we can work on this archive, and Bill & Howe (ph) did our microfilming for us. They were very helpful, and they asked me to do a booklet on the archive, which I did which was published which was rather nice. It took us about 18 months to put this stuff together, but it has proved invaluable. For example, one of the items we found were all the records of people who had ever registered with the Jewish Refugees Committee from 1933 on, and that would be from May the 18\", 1933, when the organization was started. It would have records of people who\u2019d been inquired about and you would find a card which would say, \u2018Helen Comb \u2014 deported through Tiresenstadt (ph) And it would give the date because somebody had come in and given this information. And, even to this day, those cards are useful. For example, if you want to prove that you came to England as a refugee, and claim your pension or money from Germany or Austria or some funding which was due to you, we could look up your archive and see if your name was there, and it would give the date that you arrived in England. Now, what happened ultimately, as we were working through this archive, I began to see names which said \u201cSt. Louis\u2019, and that struck me because I knew of the story of the St. Louis, this ghastly story of these people who in high hopes went in party fashion, practically, to Cuba, not knowing that they were going to be refused entry, not knowing that all but about 22 would be refused entry because the 22 had paid the extra money that was required to get a permanent visa. And I start to make cards on them, and I found about 110 of the people who came into England where it was marked St. Louis passengers, and I kept these cards. And then one day I heard from the museum, your museum, that you were going to do an exhibition on the people who sailed on the St. Louis and the face of those who landed up in Europe, but you really didn\u2019t have full records of those who landed in Britain, although you had names. And I said, \u201cIf you give me all the names, I will be able to trace all of them. And I must say it took me quite a while, I won\u2019t tell you how many weeks, to go through these \u2014 the microfilm, find these people, and take a picture of these people, and I found all 187 of the people who landed in Britain, and I felt very pleased because it will help complete your archive, and it shows the value of doing what we did and the money we spent on putting that archive together. Archives are terribly, terribly important, and I only hope that people who may look at this film will realize if they have letters from people during  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0398 67 the war, before the war, after the war, which might be useful, to find out from an archivist where they might be useful. The family might not be interested, but an archive will be able to put history together, and without our history we have no future."
