And the stories trickling out of the concentration camp -- not -- I me -- the ghettos, actually, because that wasn\u2122t then, were trickling down to central Europe and he beli -- ga -- he began to be lieve them and he discuss it with his siblings, and everybody laughed at him. He had a brother who was a doctor who said, I picked every brick in this house and they\u2122re not going to come and touch me, and I was very good to the ma yor and I treated everybody free. And we had -- they ha -- we had one uncle, he had -- my father had a brother here, who was going to send a visa to anybody w ho wanted to come. The only one who wanted to come is my father. And that was like by mid-30\u2122s, and they send him a visa and my father said, if I go by -- without me and my mother, we\u2122ll never see each other again. Which everybody else thought was crazy, but it was a true fact. We never would have seen. He said, I don\u2122t care if we -- how long we wait, we wait until we get a visa for everybody. And then that took, again, time, and we might have to wait a long time. What made our passage possible, in 1939 August 3rd, which was the last American ship that left the harbor, was the fact that in 1938 Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 8Hitler gave this part of Slovakia to Hungary . We were Slovak nationals in a Hungarian quota. If -- we had -- let\u2122s put it this way. Every country had a quota of how many are permitted, right? When we were in Czechoslovakia the quota was this long, very long. Then -- now all of a sudden we\u2122re Czech nationals and we are now part of Hungary. Now, in the Hungarian emba ssy the Czech quota was very small, because there weren\u2122t that many Czech Nationals now in one year moved there. So our luck was that that par -- Hitler gave that part to Hungary and there was a Hungarian officer in -- working in the American embassy who told my father the following; if you sell everything, buy yourself three ship tickets an-and -- and train tickets to Vienna, I\u2122ll take your visa and put it on top. And everybody again in the family thought my father was crazy, and he -- the only thing that happened to him, he was taken to a labor camp, for eight months we didn\u2122t hear about him. Then he came out of the labor camp, he got in touch with this employee and he sold whatever he could and brought three tickets from LaHavre to New York, and three train tickets from Budapest to LaHavre.

And they came with guns and very, very -- their demeanor was wa -- was very scary, even [indecipherable] I think afterwards, but to a kid, when they asked for your passport and your luggage and what th ey went through, was very much like, you know, at that point I thought this must be a concentration camp what they do.

When this happened that this ar -- little area -- Czechoslovakia was like this, it was big here, then it was Moravia, and Slovakia got thinner and then it was Putka Pascaoush which went to Russia. Slovakia was, let\u2122s say, a thin piece like this, okay? And this was given to Hungary. And the emp -- the other half was given to Poland. This narrow country known as Slovakia . Half went to Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 15Poland and half went to Hungary . The Poles were very upset that these Jews were being thrown over the bor der for them to take care of. Most of them were Hassidic and very, very religious. So they packed up these Hassidic Jews and their wives and children, got them out of Poland and threw them across the border to slo -- back to Slovakia and to -- the Slovakia that was a -- Hungary at that point. This was a Friday night, and they separated the men, the children and the things, and they did these -- put these men on the square and with a large scissors they just started to cut off their beards and their payas. And there was shrieking all night. And by morning the trucks took them away, probably [indecipherable] I don\u2122t know where.

So when I came my parents thought I would speak English well, which I really didn\u2122t do that well, and I was put in high school, first grade. And I learned very quickly on the bus w ith kids that were going from my neighborhood to high school, and I picked up English pretty fast, it wasn\u2122t hard for me. I did very well in high school. I -- I was put in -- in th -- they used to have repor -- programs, handwritten and a principal came in about two months in a class, in a Spanish class and said to the teacher that Miss Reichman belongs to speech, this is an error here, S-P, she should have been in speech instead of Spanish. And the teacher said, you can\u2122t take her away, she\u2122s my best student. So I stayed in Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 17Spanish and I learned Spanish and I got in the honors program in that high school, Julia Richmond High School, which was associated with Hunter and Brooklyn College, and in re -- I -- I enjoyed high school very much because to me it was like a new world, and I -- I guess when you excel in school so unexpectedly and make friends -- there was only ra -- ba -- one bad experience in high school. There was more than one, it sort of comes back. I-I\u2122m not doing this very sequentially, is that okay? Okay. My clothing was a problem, because that was a real sore thumb. I stood out at that point anyway, it was very different, the clothes, even though I had lovely clothes because my mother desi gned my clothes and she had all this fabulous material. When my parents came out they didn\u2122t sp eak English well at all, it was very difficult. And an uncle of mine died and left my father a thousand dollars, and my father decided to buy a business for a thousa nd dollars. So they bought a business, a rooming house for 19, 000 dollars, a thousand down, and they rented rooms in this rooming house and we had an apartment on the ground floor. And in this -- and then there wasn\u2122t -- they didn\u2122t make enough money or anything, it was somehow or other, some body in the family advised that my mother should go with -- they should go to work as a couple for a year and put some money away. My moth er became a maid and my father became a butler someplace, and I stayed with this one uncle who sent us the affidavit. Now, my Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 18father was the type of person that he did not ever take a glass of water for himself. If he wanted a glass of water he went to the restaurant, ordered a cup of coffee and they gave him some water. He never did an ything by himself. And he did this and he -- they took this job, they worked 18 hours a day, the two of them. They made 20 dollars or 25 dollars a month and when they had enough money with that thousand dollars, that\u2122s when they left and they bought this -- this rooming house. But while I was -- while they were working as a maid and a butler, the daughter of that family and I went to the same high school. And she got a gang together and she -- they teased my clothes tremendously. And I had like two or three very unpleasant things about this particular clique that was just -- I now notice, I teach, how much nicer children are to the Asian children and things like that. My generation it was the opposite, or anyhow in New York where I was. It may be because of where I lived, but they made absolutely my life miserable with my clothes and my accent, my a -- a -- at that point I was not yet excelling and I was very, very unhappy and I didn\u2122t want to complain to my parents cause I knew they were doing this, they had to work at what they were doing.

And you had just told me about some of the difficulties you were having with transitioning to the United States. You were talking about this clique. Was -- was that a form of anti-foreign sentiment, di d you think, or was it just that you were not part of their clique? Did you -- did you have any anti-foreign experiences when you first came to this country?",
            "answer": "Well, I know that teenagers tend to be mean anyway, and they can do the things that some of these girls were doing, but to me they were very specific. Number one they said -- you know, they were -- made fun of the fact that my parents worked for her as a maid and a butler and that made me an inferior person. And the second thing that they were cliquish about is my clothes and my accent. I had an accent when I came first. However, the beauty of all that was that I never did Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 20take speech and every English teacher, including my college English teacher didn\u2122t believe that I wasn\u2122t born he re, so somehow I overcame that."

            "answer": "Terrified. I was born -- I was -- I lived all my life in this little town. I have -- I have not seen a street light until I went visiting some f -- some relatives in Hungary [indecipherable] we didn\u2122t even have street light. New York is terrifying, you know, the first time you just walk around in it. And I lived with an aunt and an uncle who had no children, which didn\u2122t have -- didn\u2122t add to the point that I wasn\u2122t handled properly in many times. You know , they just said here\u2122s a quarter, go to the movies when I couldn\u2122t -- when I had, you know, when I had problems. Everything was very diffi cult. For instance, the food tasted -- tasted soapy. I felt that the Coke tasted like they had mixed it with soap and I felt that -- and my parents didn\u2122t, this was only me. I felt that a lot of the food was so strange to my palate, and it all tasted of soap. And I\u2122m sure th -- I know that this was psychological. And it appeared very, very difficult at that point because of all the other problems with being a teenager and then you know, starting to go with boys -- not go with boys, but let\u2122s say if I was invited to a sweet 16 party I didn\u2122t Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 21know how to act. I -- I always said the wrong things and I did the wrong things and it took me a very long time to arise from this backward little girl, only child who lived in a town who knew only the things that everybody else did of the same, you know, socially we all did the same thing. I mean, nobody went to a dance without the other and it was a much closer knit group that I was with, and I had to overcome that. And that was a very, very hard, for many years. But then, you know, towards the end of high school I was -- I got more into it. I got into Brooklyn College, which -- a free school which was a big deal for me and I did not want to go to Hunter. I could not stand the fact that Julia Richmond was four years all girls. And I just said I\u2122ll travel anyplace to go with -- just see boys. And then in Brooklyn College I excelled pretty well. And a German professor of mine said, would you like to apply for a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania? I said I don\u2122t want to because my parents can\u2122t afford it. They can\u2122t afford Columbia either, but they know I want to get a Masters and they said they\u2122ll take the loan. And he said, just for fun, don\u2122 t tell your parents. If it happens, it happens, just we\u2122re going to put you in for a full-time scholarship. You will -- anyhow, I got this scholarship, which Brooklyn College was just thrilled, cause I was the first girl -- you know, that used to be an all boys school -- the first girl and the first Jewish girl, they combined two [indecipherable] got a full time scholarship to Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 22Columbia for a year. Full Masters, food, this -- tuition and everything else. And at that point my father knew how big this was, but he still said to me, you know, I can get that money for Columbia and I would so much rather you went anyhow. Y-You couldn\u2122t talk me out of it. My yi -- my mother worked [indecipherable] look much better on my record if I go to Columbia -- I mean, to the University of Pennsylvania. So I went to the University of Pennsylvania and that was a blast. I really in -- it was a very difficult school. But first, in several classes when I raised my hand, especially English or philosophy and I opened my mouth, the professor would say, you\u2122re one of those that came from a city college [indecipherable]. And my education just came through in many ways the professors saw that my background was very, very good and you know, we all, those of us who came from city colleges were very pleased with what we had as a background. And the university [indecipherable] was very nice, it was a great school and I got my Masters there and I wanted to teach, and when I finished I couldn\u2122t find a job because the veterans were coming home and they got preference to all teaching job. That was in \u212247. So I have a friend who got a job in Washington, a psychologist working for the police depa rtment, and sh-she\u2122s my best friend actually, and she said to me, I\u2122ll find you a job. Anyhow, two days later she sent me a telegram, I got a interview for you in a place and she said, don\u2122t get scared of Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 23the name, it\u2122s called the Army Intelligence Map Service and they\u2122re looking for people with languages. So she set up th is interview and I came down and they were very impressed with my degree, I have a Masters and they hired me on the basis of my Hungarian language, nothing el se, none of my other thing, but they\u2122re very short on Hungarian. So I worked there in Map Service from \u212247. I met my husband there, my -- and we got married in 1950. And I worked until 1952 when I had my first child."

            "answer": "[indecipherable]. Yeah, I -- I didn\u2122t want to bring up myself. I was raised in an Orthodox home [indecipherable] I became more Reformed, I would say, when we came here and we be -- joined the Reform Temple and [indecipherable] like that. But my mother had a kosher house. When the pictures about Germany came back, the skeletons and everything, and I saw my relatives in all those photographs, I became an atheist, but a true atheist. I began to talk to God about the fact that how could you let something like this happen. And any amount that I listened to Elie Wiesel or anybody else that it wasn\u2122t God\u2122s fault, I felt that God could have intervened. And as time went on I felt this was a very difficult life, to be an atheist if you were not always an atheist. And I thought about that too and I felt very guilty about the fact that I survived with my parents. Why? Wh -- I sa -- I -- in order for me to stop being an atheist I had to find out why I survived. I had to have a mission to survive because so many great people died. And I found my mission, an-and it might be a true -- a fict ion of my imagination but it worked for me, that when my first child was born and I looked at he r and I said, I know why I survived, because I know that through her and my other children, Judaism will continue forever. And I took this very seriously and I have three wonderful Jewish daughters, who believe very strongly. Who know everything about the Holocaust there is to know, even more than I do so metimes I think. And who strongly I have, Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 27y-you know, educated them in the fact that I ha -- believe that I am only surviving because to me, they will carry on Judaism. And I don\u2122t mean banging your head Judaism, I mean just Judaism philosophy, in principle and in -- as far as they want to carry it, religious. They were all Bar Mitzvahed and Bat Mitzvahed, my children, my grandchildren. I decide d to take each one of them to Israel after they were Bar Mitzvahed. When my oldest one became 13, Rabin was killed and we decided it wasn\u2122t safe to go to Israel. So we went to France instead, it was a wonderful trip and ever since any of them become Bar Mitzvahed or Bat Mitzvahed , they take a trip, but it has to be safe by me and her parents and Israel has not yet been safe. One of my major dreams is that I take all of them to Israel for a week, to [indecipherable] and I\u2122ve been there three or four times with my husband. And I still have this dream of taking my very big family to Israel, but I don\u2122t think that that\u2122s in the cards, and realistically I don\u2122t feel that politically it\u2122s going to happen, that it\u2122s safe."

But I felt that it was something very sincere in her and I did not feel it was bad. I don\u2122t think it was extreme and I was more tolerant of her, which made a good combin ation with my husband. He was not as tolerant, he just felt she was much too -- much, much too liberal about taking chan -- he was very upset when she got expe lled for 24 hours about marching, about wearing pants, which is so stupid when you think about it.

So I decided to quit my job, although they were willing to take me back to the Army Map Service cause there are so few Hungarian speaking people, on a part time basis, which at that point was in the 50\u2122s, it wasn\u2122t that common. And I decided to stay home. And my -- my oldest daughter Debbie began to draw very nicely and she came home one day and she sa id, Mommy, the teacher said that the sun is here, th-th-the -- the house is here and the -- this -- the sun isn\u2122t always on the right hand side. I tried to tell the teacher sometimes it\u2122s in the middle, when I\u2122m walking. Teacher didn\u2122t believe me. So I decided to study art at that point because I saw that my kid had something that that teacher never learned, a methodology. And I liked to draw when I was a kid, and ev -- everything else. And I took a la -- a few art courses and then I studied with Jack [indecipherable] who is a local Washington colorist. And I decided to go to st -- to teach art. Now, Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 45at that point, art was not taught in ever y school, and they didn\u2122t have any art teachers. The only way they could hire me was through resource teacher job and I -- and they started me with [indecipherable], and places where they didn\u2122t even have pencils. The school in [indecipherable]. And I started to teach art to children that actually never even had a pencil to draw with, and they were just thrilled with it. And I devised a method and I started to teach kindergarten through sixth grade. I -- I liked that age because th -- in that kindergarten yo u can do a lot with -- take them out and look at the trees and you show them the ba rk and feel the bark. And it was just my own ideas. And I began to teach un -- for -- until I retired, I guess, in 1968 and was in the school system, some -- in two or three schools, sometimes. But in addition to th at, I worked at Camp Louise. I don\u2122t know if you know where that is. I was the head of their craft department, but then I wanted to introduce more fine art. And I hired more counselors who did painting and drawing and sketching and things like that for the whole summer. And I did that for 25 years, I enjoyed that very much and I felt that children away from parents and not near a classroom, were very receptive to -- to learning and self expression. And Louise has 400 acres of -- of land and you could go under a tree and just all day, spend all day just looking at the way the grass looks at different places. So I was very successful doing that, and I enjoyed it. And wh at I did is that I called every parent Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 46that I felt had a potential student, in the fall, to give them lessons. And I made that a very strong point. I told the child that I will do that. And since then, which was about 20 years ago, I meet kids in rest aurants and different places where they\u2122ve said, oh you remember me? There was one kid the other day that says, do you know I am one of th e head designers at Bloomindales in their interior department and it was all because of what you taught me about symmetry and asymmetry. She even remembered what I was working with her. And I had -- I had a great time with kids during the summer, with art and with -- it all started with my child and art. Now, out of my three children, they all love art and we all go to museums a lot. But one of my grandchildren paints very well [indecipherable]. We had some of her stuff framed. And a -- and art has worked through th -- my whole family that way and -- and we\u2122re very happy tha -- doing it.

Bu t 99 percent of them don\u2122t even know Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 47what the word means. The first thing I ask them is do you know what the Holocaust is, and you can see on their faces, mm -- mm -- no. It\u2122s no use to go to that museum, and I told this at every meeting to everybody, if they don\u2122t know the meaning. If you don\u2122t know the word, you are wasting so much time because you are talking about something so abstract, and -- and you -- you know, you have to put these kids, some of them don\u2122t even know where Europe is, or -- or what is it that we\u2122re trying to do. We are not giving them enough basics. But I worked on that and I succeeded partially, and I am continuing on it that way. At first, as I take, and we have about 12 to a group on a good day. On a bad day we have 50 - 60, you define the Holocaust, you stand in the Hall of Witness and I try to teach them something about the architecture because I think it\u2122s a very important part. You know, if I only spend five minutes, th ere has to be something said about the architecture. Then we go upstairs and then I try to go over and I explain to them we don\u2122t have time for every picture. But as we walk along, if something appeals to you that I\u2122m not stopping, just stop me and I can stop again. The main thing is that I try -- and I must confess to you that not everybody has this technique yet, to be able to get down on the leve l that the majority of the group is on. To pick that up on their eyes, because they\u2122re too embarrassed to ask questions because they feel that they\u2122ll appear dumb, okay? So you have to somehow, sometimes ask Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 48questions, but sometimes the questions ar e a waste of time because they don\u2122t know the answers, but somehow or other fe el and see of what level you have to bring. And that\u2122s what -- that\u2122s what I do. That\u2122s what I try to do and I think that\u2122s what I do well. And I -- and -- and now, a couple of months ago they started to do the police. The police chief, Ramsey thought that all the police should go up, and the CIA. And I -- having a choice I like the children better. Well, I think that sometimes the police [indecipherable] almost like entertain me. Without the word entertain, but like teach me. I -- I -- I know everything, kind of. That\u2122s what I see on the face, you see, and it\u2122s not always there. The children then, have a book what they can write what their opinion is or what they want, or -- and I suggest to the teachers to have them do two things. Write an essay about it and also draw. Art is a fabulous thing to draw wha -- about the things, about what they saw. And the most -- most meaningful thing that was ca -- on -- in the book, was written by black girls who said that up to now I only thought that my people suffered, and I didn't want to hear about anybody else suffering. But going to this museum, it opened my eyes that there are other people who have suffered also, and I must learn about their suffering.

            "question": "So who in your family did survive the Holocaust?",
            "answer": "I have one cousin in -- in Israel, who is my age, who -- who -- who has survived as [indecipherable] one of the ships like the Exodus and then became a male nurse. I have one cousin in -- in Hungary who survived Auschwitz. Do we have time? What time is it? Oh. She came on the train in Auschwitz -- to Auschwitz, and she was -- she had a baby in her arm. And she was told on the line that if you bi -- give the baby to your mo ther on the other line, they\u2122re not going to kill the mothers and children. And of course that went first. Train she was on stopped and there was some ki nd of trouble, she got out not in the front of the car, but in the back door of the car and it said k\u00fcche , and she spoke German. She went into the kitchen, she put on a chef\u2122s hat and a chef\u2122s uniform and started to -- and a -- an officer came in and she said -- he said, are you a new cook? And he -- she said yes. And she survived Auschwitz being in -- the cook, for three years there, without any papers or anything like that. And she was -- she was -- had a hard time because she could steal food, like the milk cans, you see? She could mark cans spoiled and they took them away at night . Well, where do you send the milk cans? There are 10,000 people in Auschwitz and the word got around that she sends the milk cans here. And the people that saw her walking someplace would try beating her up. It was a very difficult position in this particular area of Auschwitz, to be Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 52working in the kitchen, and not be able -- be equal to 10,000 people in terms of what you can do extra. So even when she survived and went home, the people tried to stone her, oh it\u2122s a terrible thing. But she survived. She had a husband who was a Hungarian Jewish officer and they -- the Germans put those in the front of the Russian line so they should kill them. He was captured by the Russians, she hasn\u2122t heard for seven years, the rabbi said that you can get married. So she was marrying his brother and two days before th e wedding, he came home. And this is what -- what the -- for seven years he was in a Russian camp and he had a prayer book that was one inches long, somepla ce hidden. And he was davening one night and a Russian soldier saw him and said, I\u2122m Jewish too, I\u2122ll get you enough food. So he gave him enough soup to last that he survived the seven year. Then they were sent home, about 20 of them from this camp, and they hit a warehouse. They broke into a warehouse, it was a sugar warehouse, it had sacks of sugar. They cut the sugar open, they started to eat the sugar and 95 perc ent of them died because their stomachs were this small, and my cousin\u2122s husband fainted after about the fifth -- and his luck was that he fainted and didn\u2122t eat. So then he walked back to where he was, which took another couple of days and he came in. So that\u2122s the second and the third survivor. I have another survivor in Czechoslovakia who was Interview with Susan Berlin March 7, 2003 53in Auschwitz , and I don\u2122t know how she survived . And the rest, a few of them, are the second cousins."

I f eel that my family survived and Judaism survived with them, and it\u2122s not going to disappear until there\u2122ll be two people, like in Masada . I think that -- that Judaism will survive under all circumstances and I certainly, in my family will make sure that it does, and make it as palatable and as ag -- as agreeable to my family as I can.
