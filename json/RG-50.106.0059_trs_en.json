So, I mean, they had the -- in the team there were social workers and people like th at. But the training was more to teach you how to cope with new situations. So they had a lot of, kind of , make-believe. We lived in a big house in Hampstead and they would -- one da y they would decide that this house was a refugee center and that thousa nds of refugees were coming out of Germany and they had to be taken care of. So half the team would be the people looking after the house and the other half of the team would be the refugees. And they were instructed to behave like people who are very desperate, who didn't trust anybody after their treatment in Germany, so they wouldn't want to be registered, they wouldn't want to have their names taken. And our job was to learn to try and cope with them and, yes, it was -- it sounds a bit odd, but it was really very useful. Another day they -- they said, well, we just had an air raid and there is no -- the house is being dest royed and so we have got to make do. And so we were shoved out in the garden. And in the garden ther e were just a few vegetables that have to be in the garden, and we were told to find a way of keepi ng ourselves aliv e for the day. We were told to dig up the potatoes and make some soup out of boxe s because there were no stoves or anything. And so it was this idea of being on your own, having to do things that you had never done before, and not running away from the j ob. And that certainly was very useful.

So we were very much aware that we represented the Quakers and that we would be expected to behave like -- carry out the principles of the Friends. And this did -- this was an importa nt factor because s ubsequently when we were working in Germany under the -- while the war was on, and afterwards and the occupation, there were times when what the military authorities wanted us to do and what the Quakers would think would be the appropriate thing to do were n't quite the same. And so we had to face up to that."

We realized that the family that we were -- to whom the house belonged were obviously very unhappy abou t the whole situation. So we came to a compromise. So we -- two or three members of the family lived in the very top floor of the house, which we didn't have to use, and we took over the rest of the house so that we didn't feel that we were kind of being part of an action to take the property away from the family. Plus, obviously, the army would have given it back to the family eventually. But in the meantime they were very anxious to be able to keep some out of the place. That was only a little example. But we , actually, got on very well with the military authorities. They were very, very understa nding of what we were doing, a ppreciative of what we were doing, because we did lo ts of jobs.

            "answer": "Sunday, April the 22nd. The camp, I think, was -- had been f ound just about a week before. And that's the day -- I arrived in Belson on Saturday, on Saturday evening. And then on Sunday, when we got ourselves a place to park ourselves, I went into the camp on Sunday, the 21st -- th e 22nd to Camp No. 211, which was the place where they had kept all the children. One of the magnificent things about the camp was the fact that -- well, let me go back a bit. The camp was in terrible state because it ha d, by lack of concern and so forth, it had been allowed to get into a hor rible condition. It was originally a camp for about 3,000 people and there were about 50,000 people in there. There were, I think, 600 people in a hut that was designe d for 50 and they were layered. But despite that, and then as the last days before the camp was overtaken, everyt hing broke down, food, no food supply, no water supply. And -- but despite that, the pe ople had put the children -- the inmates, not the -- the author ities, had put the children al l into one barrack where they could look after them specially. And whereas in those last days it was a kind of every man for himself as far as food was concerned, they made sure that the children were looked after as best as they could in those terrible conditions. And my first job was to drive an ambulance down into the camp and start gett ing the children out. The arrangement was that about three miles up the road from the camp, the concentration camp, there was a big German Army establishment which, of course , was empty and -- but it had big concrete buildings, you know, barracks and so on. So th at was made into a reception center. And the -- between the concentrat ion camp and the new camp, ther e was what was known as a kind of human laundry. And we had -- the ambulances were divided into two groups. And Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 18 some ambulances were in the camp, going from the camp to th is mid station, which was just on the side of the road, it was a stable . But there they had set up a whole -- an arrangement for disinfecting and cleaning people up and so on. And then the other side of this place there were clean am bulances which were going from the -- from this place to the new -- to the new establishmen t. So that there was a kind of an insulation between the diseases and the lice and ever ything that the people, that th e camp inmates had, that were all washed off and disinfecte d and stripped of their clot hing and wrapped in a clean blanket. And then the other end of the -- th e other side of the bu ilding, they would be loaded into another ambulance which took them to the -- to this new establishment. So you had one series of ambulances going between the camp of what they called the human laundry and another series of ambulances going from th e laundry to the new camp."

We went up -- ther e were six teams that were called in, I think five - four Red Cross teams and one girls -- girl guides team, and the one Quaker team were called in in that very first appeal fo r immediate help. But then soon after that they got a whole group of volunteer young medical students from England who Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 20 came out. But it was a -- it was the kind of thing to begin with when everybody was doing whatever immediately needed to be done.

            "answer": "Well, the most obvious one, obviously, was its relationship to my being a conscientious objector. I remember standing in the camp very early on and looking at the terrible -- and I guess the people who upset me most in the camp were the living because they -- the walking dead as it were. Th ey were so -- I mean, ther e were people w ho had gone beyond Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 32 the state of recovery. The dead were dead and they were in peace. But the -- and the ones who were -- the survivors were getting out of the camp. But, in the meantime, there were these thousands of people dying. And they were the peop le, I guess, who upset me most because you see them walking around, walki ng from nowhere to nowhere, and then they would just kind of fall down a nd there you were. I remember thinking to myself, well, you know, while I was working on the land and the sun was shining, but under this same sky only relatively a few miles away, because Engl and isn't all that far from Germany, these people were living under the sa me sky and comparing the, you know, the fact that they were so hopeless and without any -- any hope of being save d or anything because, well, before the war ended, I mean, all the while th e concentration camps we re going, they were going on for eternity, I mean, the people -- the Germans gave up the camps only when the war was at their very doorstep. And so day after day these pe ople were in this camp and having to live under these terrible conditi ons. And it made me think about being a conscientious objector and refusing to particip ate in the struggle. And I thought about it a great deal. The only thing I could -- the only c onclusion I kept on coming to was that I still believed that war was not the answer. That there must be some other answer. And that eventually we had to ge t -- we had to get rid of war as a means of settling things. And the only way we will do that is if -- hopefully the next generation there will be conscientious people that feel the same kind of mind and eventually come to a time where people will say we are not going to have an army, we are not going to have arms, there have to be other ways of settling our differences. A nd that's -- may seem kind of high- minded theory, but on the other hand, that was as far as I got . I couldn't believe, I couldn't persuade Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 33 myself that I -- that it wa s wrong, that I should have been fighting instead, been in the army instead. But --"

Th ere are just as many problems in Europe, people fighting each other. So, obviously, there must be some other way. But whatever the way was, it was too late to save all the people who were vi ctims of the Nazis. But that may be rationalizing it, but, no, I still think, I still believe that wa r is not -- never will be an answer to our problems."

            "answer": "Yes. Well, I was in charge of th at camp. Well, the team was in charge of the camp. But my particular job was kind of the chief administrator, I guess, whatever you call it, which was kind of fun beca use it put me in some very awkward situations. I remember the 3,500 Poles, we had a Polish police force of young Poles who kind of ran the place, who looked after the security of the place. And, of course, we had a lot of young peopl e in there. And one day there had been some fighting and the police brought these -- ha d to break it up and they brought these young men in to me as camp administrato r to be punished. And so I gave them a nice Quakerly lecture about we al l ought to live together like we were members of a family and things like that and sent them off. And a bout five minutes later the head of the police force, a very nice young man, came in and said that the police force Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 34 had resigned en masse. So I said, well, why? He said, look, we have this problem in the camp. We have a kind of a riot. We go in and break it up. We get beaten up in the process. And eventually we manage to settle everything and we bring the ringleaders in to see you, and you tap them on the head and say, well , go home and be good boys. That's not going to work. So I consulte d with myself and my friends and decided we would have to have some kind of system. And so I used to dock them their cigare tte rations and things like that. Which, of course, in t hose days was cigarettes were a form of currency practically. Everybody loved to smoke. That was quite a punishment to be told you were losing one month's ration of cigarettes. Bu t I left the camp a nd went back to England. Oh, in the meantime, my wife had joined me because she was -- she al so became a member of the Quaker elite and was trained in the same place where I was trained. And then she was sent out to join me in the camp. And she was by that time a very highly- qua lified and very experienced nursery school teacher and so she came and looke d after the -- because we had a lot of children of all ages , little children in the camp, she set up th e nursery school in the camp and she set it up so well that th e UNRA, United Nations Rehabilitation Agency, were running a lot of the camps, came to our camp and saw the nursery school and borrowed her and sent her to other camps to se t up nursery schools. Then we both left and were assigned to this job of working with the young Span iards, well, al l the Spanish refugees in the south of Fran ce, because at the end of the Spanish Civil War there was a tremendous wave of refugees who fled over the frontier into France. And while a lot of them had gone back, a lot were still there. A nd the ones that were still there were very much in need of vari ous social services. We had schools, retraining schools, and a lot of Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 35 activities like that. And so I wa s in charge of that for six months. And then the Quakers brought me back to London and I was the overseas secretary for the European world."

The Friends in England did not have a permanent service group. What they did was to create a group or a service in time of need. So, for example, as I remember, there was one Quaker service in Ir eland during the potato famine. There was one Quaker service in the Franco-Prussian War. There was one Quaker service in the First World War. And there was one Quaker service in the Second World War.
