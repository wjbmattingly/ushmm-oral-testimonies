Because it was not 100 percent answer to be what you want it to be. If men were, if a woma n was, if our women were better in housekeeping than previously the me n, that was your question. Now my answer and her answer combined is that wh en the barrack was assigned for the administrative, administrative work details, to work and to be housed there, it was very a negl ected one, the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that ba rrack, which was Block four, a wooden barrack. So disinfecting took place and then the women organized the barrack to be cleaned, cleaned, __________________, we had enough of water and scrubbing material , all wooden parts, floors, whatever we had were cleaned and was, the barrack was assigned for half of administrative activities, like the camp office, as the private room of the _________________ Katya and special room for the drawing office, of which I ____________ ___ became part, not part, but in charge. We were administratively part of th e camp office adjacent, but they assigned me to a private room where I could prepare my activities and, an d work undisturbed. What _______________ underlined, which is of importance, and among othe rs, end result of my, of the beginning of my career was that any trait, professi on or activity, which had to be perf ormed, like repair of the roof, laying of the floor, of the wooden floor, repairing of any insi de work to be done, erecting some walls up between, between the, in the barracks to, to, to have some partiti ons erected actually, to have an room, you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain activities, so the camp office was erected by putting ________________ wall and, and, and dividing that into a certain size. Then the private room also, top administrative inmate, like Katya, who was, became the report _______________ and another room which I, whic h was assigned to me where I 41 could work and was called the dr awing office. They had neglect ed the _________ ______ drawing office all the time, I don' t know why, I have been known ___________, known as the_______________ from the camp office, but I was actually in charge of the drawing office, in addition to, to, to the administ rative belonging to the camp of fice.

And what I just want to add to it, that because of that, the policy was, if there's a woman who can perfor m anything a man would have had to do, a man was, if ther e was a capable woman, able to perform those that did it as they preferred, a woman, because they wanted to avoid the, th e contact between men and women and that was always an opportunity to exchange certain views, to spread certain news, or words or whatever. And if that wouldn't have been the policy, I would have never obtained my drawing office, never have been put in charge of the drawing office, wh ere I could practice whatever I have been trained for, that means graphics, okay?
