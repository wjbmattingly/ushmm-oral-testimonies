            "answer": "I've been moving from barrack to barrack in the whole region, including later on, new zone that was established with the new camp and I had the permission to measure each barrack, each, to take all the measurements because I pretended that I don't, that I want to do that myself because I don't want to use original architectural drawings. Because we were smuggling out plans and if we would have ever caught, then they would have suspected that I have been involved, yeah? So I camouflaged my whole operation by, by, measuring the whole model which I made, measuring barrack by barrack and distances from each barrack and so on. So I had set camp in, still in my head, I can know the numbering system, good or bad, whatever afterwards, I couldn't care less, but I, I produced a camp model and a good one which were sent, taken away and sent first to the, to the headquarters of the SS and then they told me it was to Berlin. And so did all my other, other work of drafts and diagrams went to the ofttimes. But we had no fifth row in the camp flag like produced in all of those drawings. As I have shown you, I have here some publications, with correct, with correct drawings, with correct numbers. Everything else were done and copied by, by a people who were more interested in, in, in, telling their stories than to make a correct, authentic, they are people who could not read a map then and from young people like Kitty Hart(ph), I don't where she learned to read an architectural map or a land drawing or so. And she just copies it and if go further you will find dozens and dozens, many dozens of ____. But how could the Air Force produce aerial views if, of things which did not exist then, I mean that is a very touchy, touchy, situation, don't you think so?"

                " [speaks foreign language here] I: Iam going to translate, but I'm going to historically answer your question, okay? Because it was not 100 percent answer to be what you want it to be. If men were, if a woman was, if our women were better in housekeeping than previously the men, that was your question. Now my answer and her answer combined is that when the barrack was assigned for the administrative, administrative work details, to work and to be housed there, it was very a neglected one, the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that barrack, which was Block four, a wooden barrack. So disinfecting took place and then the women organized the barrack to be cleaned, cleaned, , we had enough of water and scrubbing material, all wooden parts, floors, whatever we had were cleaned and was, the barrack was assigned for half of administrative activities, like the camp office, as the private room of the Katya and special room for the drawing office, of which I became part, not part, but in charge. We were administratively part of the camp office adjacent, but they assigned me to a private room where I could prepare my activities and, and work undisturbed. What underlined, which is of importance, and among others, end result of my, of the beginning of my career was that any trait, profession or activity, which had to be performed, like repair of the roof, laying of the floor, of the wooden floor, repairing of any inside work to be done, erecting some walls up between, between the, in the barracks to, to, to have some partitions erected actually, to have an room, you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain activities, so the camp office was erected by putting wall and, and, and dividing that into a certain size. Then the private room also, top administrative inmate, like Katya, who was, became the report and another room which I, which was assigned to me where I could work and was called the drawing office. They had neglected the drawing office all the time, I don't know why, I have been known , known as the from the camp office, but I was actually in charge of the drawing office, in addition to, to, to the administrative belonging to the camp office. So drawing office became office of the drawing office. So I was from the [speaks foreign language here]. But, but she, especially on the , certain functions could not be performed by a woman, because we had no know-how, like repairing of the roof, the replacing of broken glasses, putting a new floor, building partitions to, to divide camp, barracks, , designated to us, into a housing or sleeping, sleeping area and another area, so there we had the first time, certain male work details who were coming from the mens camp to perform those activities. And what I just want to add to it, that because of that, the policy was, if there's a woman who can perform anything a man would have had to do, a man was, if there was a capable woman, able to perform those that did it as they preferred, a woman, because they wanted to avoid the, the contact between men and women and that was always an opportunity to exchange certain views, to spread certain news, or words or whatever. And if that wouldn't have been the policy, I would have never obtained my drawing office, never have been put in charge of the drawing office, where I could practice whatever I have been trained for, that means graphics, okay?

I have been just explaining what I said, what I've been adding to her previous statement and made my remarks that while reading, while counting the kind of professions, which women could not perform and therefore we had to engage male prisoners, well, in addition she added painters. So I said but we had painters only later and they have been always looking for painters in the , but in those days we had no painters, no. "

Produced wrong information, cause they engaged in so-called consultants, a famous from Auschwitz, who didn't know the difference between an, an, Jehovah Witness and an Jewish and a non-Jewish person who had a love affair with a Jewish man, they were differently marked, the women's camp had their own, yeah and I will probably sit down with you and explain to you my activities and my functions and my work in the drawing office.

That was in Warsaw in headquarters of the international Auschwitz committee, under the stewardship of ____. And then there was the museum and there are people who tried to do their best but the world was not very sympathetic, they had no money, they had no, they were not very, we were not very popular because the world had enough in those days, so there was a Stagnation of interest and after awhile people started to publish correct or incorrect. But then it comes to diagrams and to the drawings of the camp, there were irregularities, they were using some, they couldn't, tools, all those by foot, they had no experts to perform, they, to perform a layout of the measurement instruments, they had no access to the camp building office, they didn't even know then that it ever existed. People, the historians who were trying to start to bring the history down to paper, had no idea that there was an Auschwitz official building office and so that those, that, maps and drawings and sketches were preserved miraculously, yeah. We know today how the camp looked, we know and, but somebody was, sit down and complain. So the first plan was used, the first basic information was used from , that document of, the Berlin planning of Auschwitz. I mean they tried and they still have enough of material and they had enough of material, but it was wrongly interpreted because the draftsman who was able to read the drawings, was not reading the historical background, yeah? If they would have done what I did all my life before I had to perform a drawing for my husband for his publication, I first had to learn the text and to translate his scientific language into simple lines and diagrams. The people who were assigned to make the sketches of the first sketches after the war, were not presented with an historic background, they're not even asked to read or to understand what they are drawing, what they are doing and so we have know the after effects."
