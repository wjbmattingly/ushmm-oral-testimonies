And there were about 600 people there, all Polish refugees. And we met many of them whom we knew from Bucharest, from caf\u00e9s, from streets, from cinemas, and so forth. So, I \u2014I still say this is one story that is not explored how this was organized, this whole evacuation. Somebody bought the whole ship, and \u2014 and we didn\u2019t have any money. We were living in a very luxurious apartment, yes, with the Otis elevators, electric then, and they had the Mercury car, Ford, waiting for us on the by \u2014 you know, because \u2014 because of my stepfather\u2019s environment he \u2014 he lived in.

And few days again, six 0\u2019clock in the morning on the station, and somebody gives a bag, and in the bag are tickets for this express train to \u2014 to the ports. Who organized? And then I find 600 people on that \u2014 on the boat. I made lot of sketches in my notebooks, of these evacuees. It\u2019s a caricatures I was drawing you know, what they were doing, you know. Sitting in the bar, vomiting across the deck. Watching sun \u2014 sunsets, you know, on the Black Sea. And we ended up in Constantinople, in Istanbul. Again, evacuation, a boat across the Bosporus. A villa on \u2014 on the shore of \u2014 Sea of Marmara. Lots of people here \u2014 here and there. And then one day, again notice everybody to the station, railroad station on the Asiatic shore. Tickets for the \u2014 for the cars, and we go, 24 hours across Turkey to the southern port of Mersin. Two weeks there, again, sitting on the beach, eating oranges from the trees, a novelty. Waiting, waiting, waiting, suddenly a ship comes, and \u2014 and is anchored on the [indecipherable]. So everybody is parked, okay, here, on this hour, in the dock, barges take us to the ship. As we aboard the ship it says, Polish flag, is says Marshaba(ph), the name of the ship. One of the merchant ships who was, at the beginning of the war, serving the eastern Mediterranean. So it was organized that it will take the \u2014 the \u2014 the refugee somewhere. And there is this story that one of this crew was telling us how he remembers the evacuation of \u2014 escape of Jews in \u2014 Interview with Jerzy Glowczewski \" May 8, 2013 in \u2014 in old, worn out boats, who were unworthy of \u2014 not sea \u2014 to go into sea. So they were just sailing toward Palestine, and their crew was abandoning, so they \u2014 they became victims of a accident, and as a \u2014 survivors of sea, they had to be accepted by the British, with \u2014 that was how they were going around the \u2014 the \u2014 the British blockade, for Jews to go to Palestine."
