And he was well connected, and he got me an admission to the University of Southern California. So I went to the cons ulate in Genoa to see the American consul to pick up the visa, and the consul asked me, do you want to stay in the United States? And I said, of course. And it was absolutely the wrong answer, because the moment I said that, I couldn\u2122t get the student visa, because student visa is only for temporary stay as a student."
