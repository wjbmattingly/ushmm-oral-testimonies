            "question": ". . . and where you were born?",
            "answer": "I am Robert Treuer, I wa s born in Vienna, Austria, Januar y 31st, 1926. My family, my parents and I, I was the only child were consider ed Jewish even though we did not practice the religion, and know I had my grandparents and I am told, my great-grandparents. However, in the European system, such as it was, we were consid ered Jews, and when I st arted first grade, and school began with the saying of the Lord's prayer, the teacher rapped an interruption and pointed to me and said you can't say that, you have to be qu iet while the rest of the children say the Lord's prayer, and we'll start over again, and they did. I vividly rememb er March of 1938, when the Nazi's came in. I remember the tension during the days beforehand. I was awakened about two in the morning by SA troops marchi ng in front of our house, sing ing the _________ song, marching throughout the neigh borhood. It was not the firs t time that violence had come to my neighborhood, but I'll talk about that later. That night, there were very few Jews in this neighborhood, this was the nineteenth district Vienna, Dehrbl ing(ph) and the part we lived in was Severing(ph), it was near the city outskirts on the edge of the Vienna woods. That night ther e was a bloody beating of another Jew in the neighborhood, man by the name of Roldt(ph), or Roth, as I recall it. He had been accused of being a pedophile. Whether this was true or not, I don't know. My parents were not bothered, not was I that night. My father operated a very small stationery store, about a block from the house where we lived where we lived, at six _______, it was a two room apartment, second floor. My mother gave piano less ons, either at home in our ap artment or going to the homes of others. My father and I did not know this at th e time, or as a child, had been in the anti-fascist underground during th e years prior to the Nazi takeover in 1938, smuggl ing escapees across the 2 border near Czechoslovakia, bringi ng in underground newspapers fr om Czechoslovakia, and he and an associate distributed these news papers. What happened was that he had been very active in the social democratic party, particularly in youth and children's activities and cultural activities until the fascist takeover in 1934 and the fi ghting that then erupted. My fath er was involved, he had tried to distribute guns from the back stoo p of his store. I saw the figh ting, I saw the _____, the national guard is comparable, and the privat e armies come through the street s, heard the shooting, a sniper shot at my father in our apartm ent, the bullet imbedded above my head in my bedroom as I was asleep. The fighting didn't last lo ng, artillery was used to shoot at the worker's apartment houses, notably the Karl Marx _____, the kilometer long first public hous ing for low income people in the city of Vienna, and in other apartment complexes there had been an effort during the socialist administration to provide low income housing. The fighting was bitter. Armored car and carriers and trucks pulled up in our street and went on door to door searches of people' s apartments looking for contraband, guns or political material, what have you, and these _____were repeated. When school resumed after a few days of the fighting, I passed by artillery emplacements on the street corners and armed troops at inte rsections who waved us children across. I didn't understand the political ins and outs of it, but I understood exactly what happened because the children's home where I'd gone after school, all activ ities that had been part and parcel of my personal life then as an eight year old were shot down im mediately and completely. And st ories came back home about, for example two men waiting for a street car at a street car stop, telling a joke, not realizing that the man standing behind them was a plainclothes police who promptly arrested them for telling a political joke, and even as an eight year ol d, I knew what that me ant, that you had to be very careful. Of course my parents were careful in that they did not tell me very much information that by blabbing I could possibly hurt them without meaning to. For example I did not know until many years later 3 that my father took long summ er vacations, during which he established a new identity as an itinerant farm laborer on farms along the Austrian-Czechoslo vak border. The growth of the Austrian Nazi party was palpable, although again as a child I did not , that did not register with me particularly. When the Nazis, or when Anschlus s came, in March of 1938, and the German army marched in unopposed, either by Au stria or any other international community, and apparently with the tacit backing of Mussolini in Italy, the recepti on that I saw of the German troops, you know the Nazis, by the Austrian popula tion was overwhelming. And for example, many of the active socialists, even those in the underg round, switched parties and joined the Nazi pa rty. Some of them warned my father that because they knew, now the Nazis woul d know about his underground activities and that he and his associate, Ernst Pollit(ph) would be very wise to cut it out immediately. My father, Fritz Treuer, was under no illusions what the advent of the Nazi s meant, he knew about the Nuremberg laws, about the persecution of th e Jews, about confiscation of property, and he immediately started making efforts to get us out of the country. Some of the rest of our relatives were not as alarmed as he was, my mother's two sisters and th eir husbands, professional people, thought that well, they were engineers, they had particular skills that were in demand and they didn't, while things might be unpleasant, there wa s no great danger. My father tried to tell them otherwise and was not believed. He also tried to ge t three or four Jewish boys together and give us the beginnings of rudime ntary military training in somebody's garden behind a house, a high hedge or a wall around it, it lasted exactly two times, two afternoons after sc hool. Somebody saw us, it was reported and one the erstwhile socialists got ahold of Dad and said this had better stop right now or you're going to get nailed. That was the end of that. My accordi on teacher, who came to our house in a streetcar, was stopped in the street. He was a very large man, his name was Hamlish, and very curly black hair, he was immediately taken for a Jew by passing by Nazis, who began 4 pulling his hair, beating him up and so on, although I think he would have been big enough to take care of any two or three of them. It was impossible, they were arme d. That was the last accordion lesson. Hamlish incidenta lly, and his wife managed to escape, I'm not sure exactly how they came to New York, they subsequently had children born in this country, one of wh om is Marvin Hamlish, a musical arranger."

            "question": "No, there were many, that was just a representative?",
            "answer": "That was a representative, there were many, an d on the street there was the usual bullying. My parents took the attitude that whether it was racial or not, I had to fight my ow n fights, which I did. The anti-Semitism was generic and general and you pi cked up on it in many subtle ways. It was not usually violent, except as when kids fought on the streets, al though I do remember one incident which may give you the flav or of it, is before the Anschluss, some of us kids were playing in the street and I was, chasing each other, reckless, I didn 't look, plunging across th e street head first and ran into a bicyclist hard enough, I bent the front wh eel of his bike badly enou gh so he couldn't ride it. I got some good cuts and bruises out of that one, but he immediately fo und out who I was, knew who my father was and he was a local Nazi, remember this was before the Anschluss, and he marched me and his damaged bike to Dad's store and swung enough weight by virtue of his party membership so that before Dad could even attend to me and take me to the emergency room, which was done later, he had to pay the man off for the damage to the bike, cash then and there or else, and the or else could and probably would have been bea tings, damage to the store, what have you. After 5 the Anschluss, and very quickly saw, there was such an explosion of uniforms, Hitle r youth and so on, amazingly fast. There were round-ups of Jews in the streets, made to scrub the streets. This happened to a distant relative of ours, and elderly woman, not in go od health and when some of the people standing around made remarks about that to the storm troopers who were conducting the street scrubbing, one of them wa lked over to the woman and said, well I think maybe you can get up and leave, it seems you're not Jewish, and she sa id, yes I am, I'm 400% Je wish, all four of my grandparents are Jews. A simila r thing happened to my mother who was round ed up between piano lessons, on the streets of Vienna, and she was blonde, blue-eyed, petite. If you wanted a poster girl for your Aryan woman, she would have been it , and again when she wa s down there scrubbing streets, people started to mutt er that these stupid SS men, SA men didn't know what they were doing, look at this, and one of them told mom to get up and get out of there and she said, no I'm Jewish, I belong here the same as the rest of these people, I'll go when they go. And I think that was a very short-lived, street scrubbing. It wasn't always that kind."

            "question": "So immediately after Anschlus s, you immediately felt an imp act on your personal lives?",
            "answer": "It was immediate and it was massive. In the p opular support, and you heard nothing against it, no one spoke against it, and my parents got busy, my father particularly. Remember him telling my mother that it was only a matter of days before the Nuremberg laws were applied, as indeed they were, and that they had to do ev erything possible to get out of the country. Now I la ter came across, in my parents personal papers, and then they're both dead now, corresponde nce to Bolivia, Mexico, Chili, anywhere possible to ge t out. What eventually happen ed was that my mother found employment as a housemaid in a rural English hous ehold, I think through an employment agency. Through a refugee agency, a place was found for me in an English boarding school, an Orthodox Jewish boarding school wh ich would take me in, because the la w at that time was if you were an 6 adult you could enter England only if you had proof of employment, if you were a child, you had to have proof that somebody would take you in, well my mother's employers would not allow a child, however the place in the boarding sch ool sufficed for me. We were taken to the railway station, the _______, the west railway in Vienna by my father and a few family friends, I had no brothers or sisters and took the train through Austria, Germany, exiting Germany at ______ through Belgium and then to take the boat, the channel boat to England, except that at ______, the train was stopped, all Jews were taken off, rounded up and surrounded by heavily arme d police, SS and others, and the train pulled out and left. The reason for that, I don't know, it could have been that one person on board the train had tried to smuggle contraband out, at least that's wh at was said. We were standing in a cluster approximately, I would guess about 40 or 50 refugees with our lu ggage, such as it was, and tightly hemmed in by armed guards. My mother , Mia Treuer and I, were in the middle of this cluster and she took a quick look around, clamped my hand in hers and we each had a suitcase in the other hands and whispered to me, she said, don't look, don't say an ything, come. And she marched through the middle of this packed littl e crowd, between two guards looking neither left nor right and they looked a little surprised and she kept right on going, I with her, into the restaurant, station restaurant, where I ha d the first cup of coffee in my life, and we sat very quietly, she and I at that restaurant table, nursing a co ffee. I don't know what happened to the rest of the refugees taken off the train. We sat in that ca fe for hours until the next train ca me, at which time I was ready to leap up and run for the train, and with one look at my mo m and I sat right where I was. People got off that train, other people got on and she didn't make a move. I was just bursting with impatience because I knew I was waiting there. And at the last moment she said, ve ry abrupt, come. We grabbed our suitcases, out the door, up the steps of the train and it started to move, it was moving as we found seats in the trai n and seconds later, we were out. I owe her my life. No t only in the sense 7 that she gave me birth. The trip through Belg ium on the train was uneventful and the channel crossing eventful only by my gettin g sick to my stomach. Took the ____ train to London where my father's brother was waiting for us. I don't know how he got out, I susp ect he was in London illegally, but I don't know the circumstances. He met us at the train, took us to a hotel. As we rounded the corner to enter the hote l, roof to floor, Nazi banners are flying there and I panicked, I was terrified, I didn't know what had happened, were we back in Germany or what? But it turned out some sporting event and the Na zi team was being hosted in London. The next morning my mother took the train for her employm ent out in the country side. My uncle took me to the school where I was to attend. Turned out to be an Orthodox Jewish school. The headmaster, my recollection is a black coat, white shirt, black tie, a bl ack hat, full beard. Looked me over as I was brought into his office and said this boy is not a Jew. My hair was ____. My uncle assured him that I was. I was quizzed on my knowledge of Hebrew which was none xistent, although in a cram course, an effort was made to teach me something be fore I left. It hadn't taken. And although my knowledge of English was very limited, I only had a few words at that time, I understood very clearly that he wouldn't take me. Because this was a strict religious school and he could not violate the integrity of the school. My uncle pleaded with him, first time I ever he ard my uncle plead with anyone. He was a mountain climber, kayaker, skier, and boyhood idol of mine. But he pleaded, he said there was a real risk and a danger that if I were not where I was su pposed to be I would be deported and no questions asked, it would be im mediate, and his pleadi ng must have had some effect because the headmaster of the school did consider it and he asked one more question, I didn't understand the English, it had to be translated for me, and the question wa s, was I circumcised and the answer was no, and he said, no we can't take him. Not even for one day, not for two days. We left. Just how my uncle found another boarding school, I don't know if this one was religious 8 secular. I don't know , but before the end of th e day he had found another school that would take me in free, there was no money. What little our fa mily had had been sequestered and we had no money. This school turned out to be a snake pit. My firs t night there, sleeping in the large dormitory with many other boys my age, one starte d screaming in great pain, and I tried to find out from the boy in the bed next to mine what was going on and I didn't understand the English, and he pointed at his appendix and I knew what that was, the boy had appendicitis and he screamed for a long time before finally some of the staff showed up and the gist of what they had told him was to turn over and pray. Well I understood that clearly enough, I found myself in a place where if you had appendicitis, you prayed. The next day the other kids went to various classes, I had no English, they told me to hang around in the kitchen and I did. I was raped before the day was out, by a staff member. I told no one. I felt responsible for what had happen ed, it was my fault. I didn't ____find out until long afterwards that this is a common reaction of victims, of child vi ctims of sexual abuse that the child takes on the bad fe elings about what happened. It's a simple phenomenon, I know it now. During the magic years of childhood, the adult can do no wrong and if something happens between a child and an adult that is wrong, it canno t be the fault of the adult. And I was a very small, pint-sized 12."

            "question": "So you really had no one close to you that you could talk to about this?",
            "answer": "My uncle did come to visit me. He had made it plain to me that I could not stay wherever he was staying and I had the impression that he shifted places to stay every couple of days. This is what 9 makes me think that he was there illegally. There was a small handful of Austrian socialists there who tried to help each other and apparently he would sleep with one fami ly one night or two and then move on and I didn't tell him what happened to me. He could tell quickly enough that something was out of whack but he didn't know what, nor could he do much about it except that he did get me out of there. He made connections with another Vienna socialist who was the director of a refugee camp for Spanish orphans, these were the orphans of _____, the surviving children from Basque, Spain, and the British while they would not help the Spanish Republicans, did put up a tent, a temporary tent camp in Kens ington Park in London . Home of Peter Pa n, I'm told, and the Viennese socialists whom my uncle knew and who it turned out also knew my father, they made a deal and my uncle came and got me from that sn ake pit and took me to th e tent camp where the director of the camp met me at the gate. He said are you Bobby Treuer? I said yes. I was carrying my tiny, little red cardboard suitcase, which I still have, I said yes, he sa id, you are Fritz Treuer's son? I said yes. He said I know a Fritz Treuer fr om Vienna. He said run, and I ran. I ran through the gate and into tent city and dark haired, dark skinned kids saw another dark hair, dark skin kid coming and they enveloped me and I disappeared into one of the tents. They didn't speak German, I didn't speak Spanish, none of us had much English, we all spoke survival. We supported and loved one another. One day ther e was news of a Republican victory in Spain, I don't k now how it got it, and there was an impromptu torchlight parade and we ran around the perime ter of the camp, was so happy, somebody was fighting for us, and they won. We ran around there until we dropped. It was only four or five days later and the black bord ered envelopes came, the typical European death notices were bordered in black, the envelopes we re, and mail call, and one kid after another came and picked up his mail, and each of us felt we had died a little bit because we knew enough about defeats, I had known about them ev er since 1934, one fight after anot her. One escape after another 10 and finally a smell of a little vi ctory somewhere and then the death notices, oh yeah. There's an incident that happened to me in Vi enna before we left that I want to tell you, two of them. I was riding the streetcar, forget whether it was on the way to school or fr om school, and a bunch of Hitler youth spotted me, and they must have seen the Jewish insign ia on my streetcar pass, and one of them said, get him, and I leaped off the streetcar, ran in front of it, there was one coming the other way and the motorman was clanging with his footbe ll because the two were just about head to head and I had ducked in front of that one and ran. I remember correctly, I ran across the street, over a wall and onto the grounds of the _______ House, a hospital in the 19th district in Vienna, but by ducking between the streetcars I lost my pursuers, by the time both streetcars were gone, so was I. My kids ask me, well, my American boy and kids have asked me when I told them about this, if they would have killed me, and I don't know. I tell them I didn't stick around and find out. And another incident that comes to mi nd, about the same time before we left Vienna, I had to go to the dentist, to get some cavity fille d and the dentist had to leave the office for a few moments to do something, get something, and I happened to notice so me publication from th e Nazi party lying on that round tray where he keeps his instruments. I was a nosy kid, I want to find out what they were telling him, and they were instructio ns to dentists, what particular political points were to be made by the dentist in discussion with th e patient while he was treating them and the instruction to bear down with your drill to reinforce a point. Clear recollection."

It was a Schubert song, I forget now, _______, Your Thoughts are Free , well that was forbidden, and one of the things that happened shortly after th e 1934 putsch that I remember , the Austrian government had negotiated and art exhibit of _____ cartoons and prints with the French government, and the arrangement had been made before February 1934, but the exhibit arrived mu ch later and it couldn't be canceled, it would have been awkward, and the workers of Vienna turned out by the thousands because they couldn't be st opped from going to see it and of course these we re political satire and was a way of expressing how they felt, and they stood there by the thousand s in absolute silence, not knowing who would report anyo ne for any comment, to view th e ____ exhibition in Vienna.

            "question": "You said he was a shopkeeper , that was his, what kind of?",
            "answer": "He ran a little stationery store, little bit of candy, which was too high for me to reach and ran a typing and mimeographing service in the back of th e store, and one of the ways in which they distributed the underground newspapers, which by then were printed in Czechoslovakia on tissue 12 paper, was that he did a lot of typing, mimeographing for a man by the name of Leon Schalit, who was the official translator of Ga lsworthy's works into German, a nd what Dad and his associate did was slipsheet the underground newspapers into the book manuscript to be returned to Schalit, and Ernst Pollit(ph) who helped my Dad, had to make almost daily trips back and forth between Dad's shop and Schalit's home, and this was a means of getting the ne wspapers out. Ironically, a high Vienna police official lived in the same buildin g that housed my dad's store and had two armed guards standing in front of the bu ilding all the time and they would check Pollit(ph) periodically and find out what he was carrying, but the packages were so big and heavy and clumsy that they didn't want to bother with him and they saw him every day, so they were never caught for that. During the first days of the fascist takeover in '34, the underground newspaper was printed on the presses of the largest newspaper in Vienna. After that paper had fi nished it's first run, th e printer stayed behind and ran off the underground newspape r. They got away with that for months until some bookkeeper upstairs in the office found out that the electricity bills were higher than they used to be and they got caught. Yeah. Well one thing leads to another, I remember my father mee ting with some streetcar motorman and the discussion was how to distribute underground newspapers at a big football game, and they came up with this system that the street car line ended next to the football stadium and that the motorman had a few minutes between runs and they used, they would ball up the newspapers and fire them over the outside walls of the st adium with slingshots, an d they fell amongst the audience. Not a very efficient system, but what can you do? You wanted to ask some?"

            "answer": "Yes. He did this before the Nazis came, he had a pretty keen sense of what might happen, and I believe continued that after he had shipped Mom and me out of Vienna. He closed the apartment. All the goods and contents had b een taken anyhow by the concierge' s daughter and son-in-law, he was SS, they took the whole apartment and Dad just disappeared and I believe he lapsed into that identity, but in mean, had to come back again frequently to process his papers for his exit. Now, his recollections to me _____ Vi enna visits, were that he had to sta nd in a long line at a hotel in Vienna, downtown Vienna, I believe he said it was the Imperial if I rememb er correctly, had been taken over by SS, to process exit visas and what have you. He said as he got there early in the morning, two lines had formed, he stood in th e one he believed he had to go through, and the other line were elderly couples and it turned out that these people were undergoing compulsory divorce if one was Aryan and the other one Jewish, they were compelle d to be divorced and he described to me not only the utter silence in which both lines inched forward, but the weeping, the old people as they came back down, not knowing where to go, what to do, w ith whom they could be. It was pitiful, absolutely pitiful. During that time also, while my father was back and forth between Vienna and his farm laborer identity, he had to pass a medical examination, which revealed him to have a hernia. The Nazis wouldn't let him out unless that were operated on. He underwent the operation and was not given anesthes ia and pleaded with the doctor for anesthetic after the incision was started and the doctor put the scalpel down, he sai d, you have your choice, if you want your exit papers signed, you'll let us go ahead, otherwise I can sew you up right now, and Dad said go ahead, and he eventually fainted. He moved from room to room when he was in Vienna and went through _______ , and had to come back to Vienna once again a couple of days before he had a ticket to get out and get into England. Again I don't, job as a gardener or a houseman or something had been found for him. The morning he was to leave, there was a ______, the street was sealed off, the 14 trucks pulled up, they were going door to door. They came, and he was renting a lower room for one night in somebody else's apar tment and he heard them coming and he was on the way out, and they came to his apartmen t and they were in the room before his, and he watched them through a crack in the door, didn't know how to get out and suddenly they we re preoccupied with finding a World War 1 bayonet in somebody's dresser dr awer and the man to whom it belonged was anxiously explaining what this was and so on, they were all clustered around him, so Dad marched out of the room, snapped a Heil(ph) Hitler salute and they didn't turn aroun d, they said Heil(ph) Hitler, he walked past them or out. We'll never know whether they were looking for him or anybody in particular but he got out. Got out, came to England and he and Mom wound up working in the same household. Now mayb e I'd better backtrack because by that time, I was no longer in England."

                " It's a time warp, I'm not sure . I would thinks some weeks, I' m not sure how long, nor can I say with accuracy how long I was in the Spanish children's home. No sense of time. But you realize even that wasn't secure, becaus e I was there illegally, and unbe knownst to me, the Society of Friends, the Quakers were working on my situation and fo und a place for me th at was both safe and legal, and that was Newtown Boar ding School in Waterford, Ireland . I made the trip, I believe alone. Arrangements had b een made for an Irish Quaker family in Dublin to meet me and they in turn put me on the train from D ublin to Waterford. I thought my self very competent and capable and _____ and doing a lot of traveling on my own an d coping with a lot of different situations, I have a clear recollection of arri ving in Waterford, Ireland, late l eaving, it was very dark, little misty, damp, sooty at the railroad station, there were four or five trains and hardly anybody got off the train and this huge man stood there waiting for me, a very ruddy face, fair ly tight curled white hair, and he said, are you Bobby Treuer, and I said, yes I am, he said, I am Mr. Marsh, I'm the headmaster of Newtown school, and he wrapped my hand in his big paw and he led me off, and I knew I was safe. I was safe not only in that place, I was safe with that man. And Newtown sc hool, which had been in existence, well now it's almost 200 years, they had almost gone out of business by the 1920's, early '30's, so many schools of that kind did and Marsh, I later foun d out had come along and said, if you give me a free hand, I will run the school and not take any salary until such time as I can get it to pay for itself. He had very strong educational id eas, that education had to be both practical, handson, personal involvement and a sense of community, a nd each child had to be challenged and allowed to develop their own bents and abilities to the max. A lot was expected, but it was within your own terms, it was the fi rst time, the first time in my life that I had a taste of freedom, where I 16 was accepted and valued as an individual, encourag ed to define and identi fy myself. And quite literally, Newtown school and the Quakers, Mr. Marsh, not only saved my life in that they saved me from deportation, they saved my life spiritually. Started me out on a long journey of finding my own worth. Let's take a break. "

I was sexually abused or assaulted or whatever you want to call it on at least tw o other occasions. Not in that school, but over subsequent years. And I think it ha d less to do with my being physically small than with my body langua ge and how I felt about myse lf. I think that's commonp lace for victims. I've had to do a lot of work on that, but it helps to talk about it, and it my talking about it helps somebody else, I'm glad to do it. I have taken four of my seven children back to Austria. I've taken them to Dachau, which of course is in German y, near Munich, I've taken them to Mauthausen, which to me is the epitome of horror, and in Mauthausen, ah, th e quarry, yeah. But at Mauthausen, there are the instructions on what to do with the pregnant women when they were brought in, and the instructions said, up to the eighth month, abor t them. After the eighth month, kill the child. That was done through suffocation, injection, smash the skull or use them for medical experiments. God damn it. Hell, I wanted my children to know, they were wanted, and that there was a time when infants were killed and the children were k illed. And my father's mountain climbing partner, his name was Shreiber(ph) wound up at Mauthausen , and we found out what happened to him, he was a strong man, he was short bu t he was strong mountain climbe r, he and Dad, the Alps, and _______, and he was one of those who had to carry the 50 kilo bould er up those 186 uneven steps to the top and they pointed him aside and had him wa lk over to the precipice and dump the boulder over, so he could carry it up again. And as he went limp after du mping it, they pushed him in the small of the back with a swagger stick and he we nt over the brink, and he died. That's Mauthausen. And I wanted my children to see th at place and I wanted them to see the pretty town, with the neat houses and the window boxes with the flowers, so that they would know that the people who killed the babies and who pushed people over the edge of a precipice went home after work and played with their kids in their pretty little houses with the window boxes and the fl owers. I wanted my 18 children to see the beauty of Aust ria and the mountains and the people and the horror. And I hope, I pray and I hope that I can, that I have taught my child ren that the capacity to harm another human being exists in each of us. ____ __ And this does not excuse th e holocaust, where society evoked and made possible and End of Tape 1 Tape 2"

I remember Sundays, Sundays, wellmeaning Britishers came to take children out for an outing and th is was a bit chaperoned in that one or two would always go along, no body would be alone, but clearly recall an older English person, seemed older to me, must have been a middle ag ed man, who obviously wa s enamored of a very pretty Spanish girl who must have been 16 or so. And we kids talked about it amongst ourselves, and I remember saying to one of the older Spanish boys, this is not right, I said, besides her boyfriend here in camp is, I forget his name, and the older boy looked at me and he said, yeah, but if he will, he meaning the Englishman, will keep her here, or marry her, she'll be safe. And the rest of us are going to have to go back, and we'll all be dead. And even at 12 y ears old, I felt the moral imperatives there. It was wrong. A young person was being exploited and allowing herself to be 19 exploited for her safety. Yeah, we buy, we buy our survival in many wa ys, and I was judgmental and critical as a 12 year old, for only a very short time. A matter of seconds, but that strange rapport and that love I then formed with those Spanish peers of mine, has o ff and on touched my life several times. It's hard to define or explain. When I was what, 15, 16? I wo rked for a few weeks one summer for the Pioneer _____ Corn Company, _______corn, even though I was short and it was very hard for me. I worked the fields_____ a migrant laborer, and it was hard work, it was beautiful work, but I couldn't keep up, but somehow that rapport clicked, I never spoke to the migrant Mexican workers about my experien ces, but the rapport developed and they would finish their rows and come down mine."

When he came out of lunch, the card was gone, somebody had taken it, he didn't know who, and rather promptly my father, still in Vien na, received the proof of affidavit and the visa and went through the 20 visa application and his ______ an d so on and so on.

Bu t he saw me off at the ferry. Wonderful man. To the train, took the train to the ferry. Met my parents in London and took another train to Southampton. We had to board a German ship flying the swastika because that's how they got the last of our money, it was an unpleasant trip and ironically the boat was virtually empty, not because at th at time the Nazis wouldn't let you go, because nobody'd let you in."
