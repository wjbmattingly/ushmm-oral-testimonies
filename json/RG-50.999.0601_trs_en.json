Thank you for your patience. Welcome to the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum. | saw a couple of you outside. Glad you made it. My name is\nWarren Marcus, | work here in the Levine Institute for Holocaust Education. I'm the host of\ntoday's public program First Person. Thank you for coming. This is our 18th season. Our First\nPerson today is Nat Shaffir whom you will meet shortly.\n\nThis season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis Franklin\nSmith Foundation, with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation. We\nare grateful for their sponsorship.\n\nA personal note. When this program first started in 1999 or 2000, my father recently\npassed away and my family sponsored First Person; so | have a very personal and important\nconnection to this. My dad was a G.I. in World War II. He didn't get to any camps but he saw\npeople coming out of them though he never talked to us about it. We found out later.\n\nFirst Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share\nwith us their firsthand accounts of their existence during this period of time. Each of our First\nPerson guests serves as a volunteer here at the museum. Our program will continue twice\nweekly through the middle of August. Come on back every week. The museum's website,\nwww.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\n\nNat will share with us his first person account for about 45 minutes. If we have time,\nwe will have questions from the audience. We'll have questions. We'll explain later.\n\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What we are about to\nhear from Nat is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide\npresentation to help with an introduction.\n\nLet's see if | can do this. Nat Shaffir was born Nathan Spitzer December 26, 1936, in\nRomania. Nat has three birthdays. We'll get to that later.\n\nIn this photograph, the photograph you saw already, we had Nathan with his parents\nand his sisters, Sara and Lily. And here is Romania, for you who didn't do well in geography\nclass. So there's Romania.\n\nNear lasi, shown on this map, Nathan's family owned a dairy farm. In 1941 the fascist\nlron Guard confiscated the farm and all the cattle just because Nathan's family was Jewish.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n2\nThe family moved to a neighborhood of lasi where Nathan's father, Anton, was able to keep\ncows and his mother, Fany, bartered products in exchange for tutoring for the children.\n\nWhen Anton was sent to perform forced labor in early 1944, 8-year-old Nathan helped\nhis family continue to make dairy products. After lasi fell to the Russians in the summer of\n1944, his dad returned to his family. They stayed in Romania for several years before\nemigrating to Israel.\n\nThere's more about Nat's life in America in your booklet but we want to spend most of\nour time today hearing from Nat and his time during the Holocaust.\n\nWith that introduction, we'd like to welcome to the stage, our First Person today Nat\nShaffir. Come on down.\n>> [Applause]\n>> Warren Marcus: Cheers. Thank you, Nat. We've got a lot to go through.\n\n| just want to remind you when World War II started, Nat was 3, so during his\npresentation I'm going to ask him to remind us how old he is during each of these segments so\nthat you will be hearing a story about life in the ghetto and you have to remember how old he\nwas when he was surviving and dealing with the difficult circumstances his family was plunged\ninto.\n\nSo the Germans invade Poland in 1939. You're in Romania. | know you're very young\nat the time but tell us about the community, your dad's dairy farm, growing up before the war\nstarted. What do you remember about that?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Before the war started, | think it was pretty normal. We didn't have any\nelectricity, any running water. It was a primitive life but it was a good life. For a while we were\nable to go to kindergarten. | went to first grade. | had both Jews and non-Jewish friends and\nthings were ok. We were pretty wealthy at the time. Life was ok.\n>> Warren Marcus: So relations with non-Jews was nothing memorable?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Everything was very much the same. We never saw a difference between the\nJewish boys or Jewish kids and non-Jewish kids.\n>> Warren Marcus: In your town, was it a large Jewish community, small?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Actually, my father immigrated originally from the eastern part of Hungary. He\nand his two brothers immigrated in 1924, after World War |. He established a large dairy farm.\nSo the community was approximately 25 Jewish families, about 89. It was a farm community.\nIn other words, it was one of the surrounding farming areas. And ours was probably one of the\nlargest farms.\n>> Warren Marcus: And you had good relationships with the other farmers, Jewish and\nnon-Jewish. Tell us about the priest who came by once a week.\n>> Nat Shaffir: What happened, getting back a little bit.\n>> Warren Marcus: Sure.\n>> Nat Shaffir: The way my father emigrated. Both my parents were born in the eastern part of\nHungary. My mother was the oldest of 12 children and my father was the youngest of six. In\n1924, after World War |, my father and two of his eldest brothers emigrated to Romania and\nthat's where they established the farm.\n\nIn 1931, my father was still single and decided he wanted to get married. His other two\nbrothers were already married. So the most logical place to find a bride was to go back to the\ncommunity that you came from. So he went back to the village that he came from. And at that\npoint it didn't have any findthebride.com. He went to a matchmaker.\n>> Warren Marcus: No yenta.com.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n3\n\n>> Nat Shaffir: No. They went to a matchmaker. The two families Knew each other. They were\nboth in the livestock business. So they were trading. So they knew each other. So my father's\nrequirements were to have a nice person, a good homemaker, somebody who could take care\nof the children and educate the children. Obviously today would not be very politically correct\nto request something like that. But those days --\n>> Warren Marcus: We'll save that for the Q&A.\n>> Nat Shaffir: My daughters and granddaughters don't approve of that but that's what\nhappened. So he found a bride. He brought her back to Romania. And before long, three\nchildren were born, two girls and a boy, and I'm that boy.\n>> Warren Marcus: All right. So you have the big dairy farm. You're doing fairly well. It's\ninteresting to say we're doing very well, almost wealthy but no electricity, no running water.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Well, that's what it was. Right. But we were happy.\n\nBut you asked me if my father got along with other farmers. Not only did he get along\nwith them but in most cases, many cases, many years, he helped the farmers. Many times\nthere were droughts. These were smaller farms where they didn't have enough need to feed\ntheir cattle. Instead of sending them to the slaughterhouses which would get maybe five cents\non the dollar per pound, my father would buy from them based on the normal fair market value.\nHe helped them out giving them feed for seeding when they didn't have any money. He always\nwas very good to the farmers. He always helped them out.\n>> Warren Marcus: And that's the way one would hope would work with your neighbors. This\nwill come back into the story later on.\n\nTell us, again, about the local priest who visited once a week.\n>> Nat Shaffir: We lived in a nice area. One of our neighbors was a priest. Once a week he\nwould come by and ask my father for a donation for the church and also for some dairy\nproducts for some of his congregants who couldn't afford to buy. In almost 20 years my father\nnever once refused such a request. One day in November, 1942 -- well before that, back a\nlittle bit. Every time the priest came over, my mother always used to tell us, the children, go out\nand greet the priest. You know, it was the nice thing to do. And every time we saw him, we\nwould go outside. We lived on the farm, when you saw the fields, you saw him coming\nthroughout open. So you come out, ask about his health, his family, wish him a good day.\n>> Warren Marcus: You all knew him.\n>> Nat Shaffir: We all knew the priest.\n>> Warren Marcus: Let's wait for the \u201c42, for that one.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Ok.\n>> Warren Marcus: | teased them saying you had three birthdays. Can you explain that a little\nbit?\n>> Nat Shaffir: We were far away from the big city. So when someone was born, they couldn't\nregister the same time people were born. So my father would mark down the birthdays on a\nBible. When he got a chance, he went to the big city and registered us. Somehow, the register,\neither when he arrived there or when he registered when my actual birthday was -- he must\nhave come maybe two months later, a month later. So my regular birthday was recorded as\nDecember 28, 1939, December 26, 1936, December 26, 1938. So three different times. We\ndidn't know exactly what happened.\n\nOne time, an uncle of mine, which later we will find out what happened to him, came\nto visit us. It was in July. His children called to wish a happy birthday. So my mother, which it\nwas his older sister, said, he wasn't born in July. There was snow on the ground when you\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n4\nwere born. So anyway, what happened, he sent away to the Romanian embassy a request to\nget a birth certificate. And he got it. And obviously his birthday is in February. So | did the\nsame thing. | sent away to the Romanian government, petition to send me a copy of my birth\ncertificate. It took a while because Romania, until recently, didn't have faxes yet. So finally got\nmy birth certificate, which is December 26, 1936.\n>> Warren Marcus: Now, you all do a little math. | just want to tell you, Nat and | were talking\nabout training this summer to running the Boston marathon. Just keep that in mind. He's run it\ntwice.\n>> [Applause]\n>> Warren Marcus: Two Boston marathons, five Marine Corps marathons. That makes you\nfeel all guilty, | hope.\n>> Nat Shaffir: All after 65.\n>> Warren Marcus: Thanks, Nat, for underlining that for us.\n\nLast thing about birthdays. Do you get two or three birthday parties every year?\n>> Nat Shaffir: No. But different friends and different family members always wish me a happy\nbirthday late or early.\n>> Warren Marcus: | have to work on that.\n\nAll right. Let's shift back into the historical time period. So this is before \u201c39. So we\nhave the background. A lot of your family lives nearby but you do have a significant number of\nfamily members in Hungary. Right?\n>> Nat Shaffir: My entire family came from eastern Hungary which remained there. We will talk\nabout later on what happened to them. But the only people that came were my two uncles, my\nfather's brother and him and my mother that came over from Hungary to Romania.\n>> Warren Marcus: Let's shift gears from \u00b039 to 41. So the Germans invade Poland, World\nWar II starts. How does that change your life? Does the government change? Does life for\nJews in Romania change?\n>> Nat Shaffir: It was a fascist government until 1941. 1941 we started hearing things going on\nin the world, particular things, Jews being sent to gas chambers, Jews are being killed, Jews\nare sent to slave labor camps. So because of these little things -- because there was no radio\nor television or newspaper. The way we heard things was primarily from the market. People go\nto the market and find out. Some of them were rumors. Some of them were actually facts. So\nwe'll hear stories coming back.\n>> Warren Marcus: Let me interrupt for a question because this comes up all the time. Did\npeople believe that? Did they believe it or did they sort of hesitate? What was the reaction?\nThere's not much historical precedence for this kind of large-scale action.\n>> Nat Shaffir: We saw some of what they called the Legionnaires, which was part of the Iron\nGuard government, little by little changing their outlook against Jewish people, more\nanti-Semitic things. We saw certain things happening where they didn't happen before.\n>> Warren Marcus: So that's the local context, as you're hearing much worse stories from, say,\nPoland.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Right.\n>> Warren Marcus: So there's a global story going on and then there's things getting worse\nand worse for you. So | think -- tell us about the lasi pogrom. That was \u00b041?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Actually a little later on. There were a couple. Pogrom is something that\nindividual citizens kill other citizens strictly for monetary values, monetary reasons. It was ok by\nthe government to do so. In other words, the government did not say not to do certain things. It\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n)\n\nwas sponsored by the government in a way, condoned by the government. Primarily 1941\nthere was a big pogrom in lasi where 10,000 people were killed within two days, July 1941.\n>> Warren Marcus: 10,000.\n>> Nat Shaffir: 10,000.\n>> Warren Marcus: And this is paramilitaries, civilians?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Anybody that wanted somebody as his property or somebody else's things\nwould just go ahead and do things like that. And they were killed brutally with shovels, axes,\nwhoever had guns with guns but they were killed brutally.\n>> Warren Marcus: Did you know anyone, your family know anyone or lose any family in that\nparticular --\n>> Nat Shaffir: In 1941, in addition to the pogrom was a train started up in the southern part of\nRomania going to lasi. They were ferried in the heat of the summer of Romania, ferried for\nthree days back and forth without any reason. Most of the people in these three trains were\ndead when they returned to lasi after three days. One of my father's brothers was among these\ntrains.\n>> Warren Marcus: So these were basically cattle cars. When you go upstairs, there's two\nthings | want you to remember, two of the many things you'll remember from that story. One,\nyou will see a cattle car of the kind used to move Jews around, similar to the one used in the\nlasi train. And also, there are actually pictures from this episode of these trains being unloaded\nwhere Nat lost one of his uncles.\n\nSo at that time, you were pretty young but how did your family react? What did you\nthink you could do? What did you think about?\n>> Nat Shaffir: First of all, we were pretty far away, about four hours away from lasi itself. So\nactually in our community, there weren't that many Jewish people in the first place so it wasn't\nreally involved in that. So we didn't -- we didn't suffer in our own --\n>> Warren Marcus: But you heard about it.\n>> Nat Shaffir: We heard about it, yes. We were scared, obviously. You hear things like that.\nWe don't know if it's going to come your way, stay in the big city only.\n>> Warren Marcus: Sometimes people say, well, did you think about leaving. Did that come\nup?\n>> Nat Shaffir: No. That's your home. That's where you stayed. You don't go anywhere.\n>> Warren Marcus: Ok. And just so we're clear, pogrom is from Russian word, an organized\nattack either supported by the government or engineered by the government. And there had\nbeen pogroms around Europe, in some countries from the 1880s on. So this isn't the first time\nthis happened. Probably wasn't the first pogrom in Romania but this was a big one at this point\nin time.\n\nAll right. So even with all of these fears, and hearing some of the international news\nand it's work time, the dairy farm, life is still ok. Right?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Yeah.\n>> Warren Marcus: But then it all changes in November 1942. Let's get back to the visit from\nyour neighbor.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Since we were such a large farm, the biggest client, biggest customer that my\nparents had was the Romanian Army. They shipped them all of their dairy products.\n\nSo in November 1942, the same priest that used to come by once a week came by.\nHowever, this time he came with an armed police officer and two Iron Guard soldiers, also\narmed. We saw these three, four people coming towards us. We all went out to greet him to\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n6\nfind out what was going on. When we came close to the group, the priest turned to the police\nofficer and pointing at us and said to the police officer, [Speaking Non-English Language],\n\"These are Jews.\" So the police officer at that point told us we had four hours to vacate the\nfarm because he has orders to take us to the -- to relocate us to a different area.\n\nMy father tried to reason with him. He said, \u201cI've Known you since you were a little boy.\nI've known your family. Can't you do something about it, forget the order?: He said, \u201cBecause\nyou know me and because you know my family, I'm giving you four hours.\u201d Otherwise he didn't\nhave to do that. My mother realized she's not going to be able to change his mind. She\nordered three of us into the house and told us to put on as many warm clothing as possible,\nmany layers of clothing.\n\nNow, Romania is very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer. November was\nalready pretty cold, snow on the ground. So we went in the home. My mother, first thing, took\nwhatever money we had in the house, any kind of jewelry or valuables. Then we started\nloading a one-horse wagon. We were allowed to take whatever we could load on that wagon.\nSo we took blankets, pillows, cooking utensils, anything pretty much that we needed.\n\nWe already heard that a certain area was established, back in 1941. So 1941, the\nso-called ghetto was established by the Iron Guard. When the policeman told us we would be\nrelocated we can pretty much knew where we were going, so we took whatever. Also, a small\nwagon, besides five people plus whatever things we had, wasn't that much.\n\nSo after four hours were over, the policeman told us time is up and we had -- he\nescorted us through the city. Once we arrived -- now, there's two kinds of ghettos, open and\nclosed ghettos. lasi was an open ghetto, which means Jews were able to move around within\nthe perimeter of the area. They couldn't leave certain streets past that so we stay in the same\narea.\n\nSo we arrived in the ghetto. We were turned over to the authorities. And the\nauthorities right away told us -- they gave us one room, that that's where we're going to be\nstaying. So coming from a big house into one room with the five of us. In that room all we had\nwas two beds. There was nothing in there no closets, no cooking place, nothing whatsoever.\nSo we were given that room.\n\nWe unloaded the wagon. We were told by authorities to show up the next morning to\ngive us the rules of the ghetto, what we can and cannot do. Most of it was what we cannot do\nobviously. So everybody kind of was in a bad mood, coming in from a large house to a one\nroom.\n>> Warren Marcus: It had to be very traumatic. Again, how old are you at this time?\n>> Nat Shaffir: 6.\n>> Warren Marcus: And your sisters?\n>> Nat Shaffir: 8 and 4.\n>> Warren Marcus: Ok.\n>> Nat Shaffir: So obviously there was a problem there. So the next morning when we arrived\nto the authorities, number one, they were -- we were told that anybody between the ages of 18\nand 50 must do work, must work, manual work primarily. They would not get paid. Jews\ncannot, even though they had money, cannot go out and buy on the open market anything. So\ninstead we were receiving ration. And the ration allowed us bread, kerosene for cooking and\nheating and other items. Other items usually like oil and sugar were told in the black market.\nWe never saw those.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nrf\n\nSo primarily we were getting a quarter of a loaf of bread every two days per person.\nSo for five of us to get a loaf and a quarter every two days. We were also getting five liter of\nkerosene for cooking and heating. Now, five liters is about a little over a gallon, two and a half\ngallons, something like that.\n>> Warren Marcus: | never understood metrics.\n>> Nat Shaffir: It wasn't that much.\n>> Warren Marcus: So the authorities, are they the Iron Guard? Are they the lasi police? Who\nwas running things?\n>> Nat Shaffir: The police department. So they were giving all the rules. Number one, Jewish\nchildren could no longer go to school. Synagogues were closed. We could no longer go and\nworship. And that was the thing that each one individual would get a job, manual job. My\nfather's job was to go out in the summer time, sweep the streets and until the wintertime shovel\nthe snow.\n>> Warren Marcus: And this is after a very successful, respected career of providing for his\nfamily as a dairy farmer and his neighbors. So it's a tremendous change.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Yeah. So every morning the man would go out -- by the way, when we arrived\nat the ghetto, they took our names, ages, gender down. They knew exactly where each\nindividual person lived.\n\nThe way it was set up, there were big houses. Each house had maybe four or five\nbedrooms. Each bedroom was given to one family. So in that house we lived with five other\nfamilies. So it was very crowded. The whole ghetto was crowded. But in particular, it was very\ncrowded.\n\nSO every morning the man would go out to do the work and come back later in the\nevening, or late in the afternoon. When | asked my mother -- my mother heard that they need\ncertain people, certain jobs to take. My mother heard the need for nurses. Now, she was the\noldest of 12 children. She actually raised the other 11 children. So she said she's a nurse.\nThey put her in the hospital to do manual work, you know, cleaning toilets and doing things. So\nobviously it was better than doing certain things on the street.\n\nMy older sister was already 8. So she was able to be a maid to one of the officials, to\nclean the houses, to the police. So my mother was working in the hospital. My father was\nusually working on the streets, sweeping the streets.\n\nOne day, the person who was in charge to clean the market area died. And the next\nmorning when people were allocating the jobs, my father was called out from the line and says\nyour job now is to go and clean the market area. The market, the lasi market was always on a\nThursday. So Thursday was the market for lasi. So he was sent out to do manual work, clean\nhorseman you're, ox man you're from the streets. That's pretty much what he was doing for a\nwhile.\n>> Warren Marcus: And what is little Nat doing?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Well, first of all to collect the rations, we had to go out of the ghetto. Number\none, we were given a yellow star with the word Jew on it. We couldn't leave the ghetto without\nthat star. Anybody caught would be severely punished. To receive the rations, we had to go\nout of the ghetto. You could not leave before 5:00 a.m. Although my sister was older, my father\nalways used to send me out to get the rations because a lot of hooligans were picking on\nJewish girls. So he was afraid for my sister so he sent me out. Many times | came\nback -- these hooligans picked on Jewish boys as well. Many times | came home with a bloody\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n8\nnose and messed up face. But that didn't hurt as much as when these hooligans took my\nbread away, which means for the next two days we didn't have anything to eat.\n\nThe first time this happened, my mother realized this could happen again so she\nstarted rationing our own family. So until she accumulated every two days instead of\nconsuming a loaf and a quarter, we consumed a loaf and a quarter less a slice. The next time\nless two slices. So she accumulated up to one loaf of bread reserve. And actually this thing did\nhappen again later on. So at least we did have something to eat. That was one of the things\nthat my father used to send me out to get the rations.\n>> Warren Marcus: Just so we're clear historically. The museum just found out there were over\n42,000 ghettos, jails, and places of incarceration. As Nat rightly pointed out, some of these\nghettos had walls, the Warsaw Ghetto. Some did not. Some you could never leave. You could\nleave this one for various reasons.\n\nSo in the morning, you would go out to get the kerosene or use the ration card. So you\nwere the delivery boy for the family.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Right. Again, we had to go out, leave the ghetto to go out. The bakery was\noutside the ghetto. We had to line up. The same for the kerosene, line up. And then individuals\nwho were not Jewish were able to just go passed and come in front of the bakery and buy\nwhatever they wanted. The Jews had to wait in line to get their rations.\n>> Warren Marcus: Not only were you restricted on what you could get but what you could get\nwas very minimal. It was very difficult.\n\n| Know a story about and a guy, this guy Grigory. Tell us about your interaction with\nthis Grigory guy.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Let me go back if | May.\n>> Warren Marcus: Sure. You're the boss.\n>> Nat Shaffir: When my father worked in cleaning the market area, what happened -- the\nfarmers would gather every Wednesday night as a group. And at midnight they would leave,\nWednesday night to get to the city by Thursday morning. So Thursday morning, one Thursday\nmorning, this old farmer saw my father cleaning the area. He came over to him and said,\n\nMr. Spitzer, I'm so sorry to see you in the condition you are. | Know you were a wealthy person.\nYou helped us a lot. Seeing you in the degrading condition you are in right now breaks my\nheart. I'm going to try to help you out a little bit. I'm going to speak to some of the other farmers\nyou helped in the past. Perhaps we can help you in some way.\n\nThe next Thursday when he came back, the old farmer went over to him and said we\nagreed to help you and here's how we're going to do that. He said the Caravan starts in a field\nin midnight, pass the outskirts of the ghetto between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning. Why don't\nyou show up between those hours at a certain area behind a certain building. Watch out for the\nlast three wagons of the convoy. We will fake a breakdown. Then we will throw something your\nway.\n\nSo my father didn't tell my mother what he planned to do because my mother was the\nrational person. She always thinks what could go wrong. My father always took a chance. So\nthe next Thursday my father went out between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning. Now, anybody\ncaught between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning outside the ghetto only meant one thing, the guy\nis trying to escape. That would be punishable by death or sometimes imprisoned. So my father\ntook that chance. Again, that's one way to have his family survive. So he went out. Exactly\nwhat happened the farmers told him would happen. They faked a breakdown. The last three\nwagons, before you know it, one of them, tossed a sack to where my father was. My father\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n9\nwaited for a while until everybody left, looked around when there was no police. He took the\nbag and came home with it. And then we found some potatoes, fruit, cheese, different\nproducts, different times. This happened almost on a weekly basis.\n>> Warren Marcus: So we understand the risk for your father to be there in the middle of the\nnight. There's clearly risk for these people, too, to do that. If they were caught, what might have\nhappened to them?\n>> Nat Shaffir: They took their life in jeopardy. Not only their life in jeopardy, also the jeopardy\nof their families. But the farmers figured that's a good thing to do because my father helped\nthem a lot in the past. So this is something maybe a payback in a way, if you want to call it\nthat.\n\nThat went on for a while until later on, finally the farmer came and said to my father,\nI'm sorry, we can't do it anymore because somebody complained to the authorities that some\nof the farmers are helping Jewish people; we can't take a chance like that for us and for your\nfamilies. So that stopped after about seven to eight months.\n\nBut while this was going on, it was really great for us. Number one, in every ghetto,\nthe same in this ghetto, there was always a big black market. So people still had some money.\nSome people would risk their lives and go out and bring in products and obviously sell it for\nvery high prices.\n>> Warren Marcus: Smuggle things in at great risk.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Right. But there were certain things people needed, shoes, pants, things like\nthis, also some food products. So when we received all of these things from the farmers,\nsometimes we had maybe six potatoes, we would trade two of them for something else, an\negg or two. So we would trade like that.\n\nSo my father would always take me to the area we traded on the black market. And\nthe reason he used to take me along is because if a grown-up was caught with this\ncontraband, he would immediately be arrested. A child would probably be slapped around a\ncouple of times and let go. Many, many years after the war my father told people he always\ntook me along for his protection.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Nat Shaffir: What happened, they established certain ways of going to the black market\narea. I'll Keep the contraband. He'll walk around 30, 40 feet ahead of us. When he saw\npolicemen, he would walk off on the sidewalk into the street meaning | should hide. So that's\nhow.\n>> Warren Marcus: And how old are you?\n>> Nat Shaffir: At this point getting to 7 years old.\n>> Warren Marcus: Ok. So you're smuggling at 7 years old, negotiating on the black market at\n7.\n>> Nat Shaffir: A little later on. My father did all the negotiations at this time.\n\nBut in the meantime, we're going out to the kerosene in the morning once a week. We\nline up at 5:00 in the morning, winter and summer. Winter in particular was cold. The attendant\nwould show up sometimes around 7:00, 7:30. And the way it was established, the way you\nwere supposed to get the kerosene, was not like today you have the gas stations. Say like a\nbooth, in the front of the booth was a little pump. In the front of the pump was a cylinder. In\nfront of the cylinder was a handle. Every time you moved the handle back and forth that would\nbring up the kerosene with that cylinder. Once the cylinder was full, it was five liters. You put\nthat into a can.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n10\n>> Warren Marcus: That was your ration.\n>> Nat Shaffir: That was my ration for the week. Right.\n\nSo this individual -- there was like a big wide line six feet away from the booth. He\nwould motion from the line for five people to come forward, remove their ration coupon for the\nweek and then fill the Kerosene. This individual was an uneducated, lazy drunk, the guy that\nactually dispersed the kerosene.\n>> Warren Marcus: How did you feel about him then?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Well, | tell you, things worked out for me and I'll tell you why. But he didn't like\nto work in particular. He always stood in the booth waiting to warm up, then come out and get\nfive more people. One day | had the guts to tell him -- his name was Grigory. | told him -- |\nproposed to him, domino [phonetic] Grigory -- the word domino is the title you usually give to\nthe president of a school, someone of authority but | called him it to give him a little bit of\nprestigious thing. | said, \u201cI'd like to help you.\u201d So he's looking at me. | wasn't a very tall kid. He\nsaid to me, \"You're going to help me? | said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He said, \u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d |\nsaid, \u201cYou look sick.\u201d Probably had a hangover. \u201cYou look sick. Let me do the work for you.\nAnd if it pleases you, perhaps you can give me a little extra kerosene because my little sister is\nsick, we could use a little extra heat in the house.\u201d He didn't say anything.\n\nThe next week when | line up, he came out and looked for me in the line. He saw me,\nmotioned to me to come forward. He said to me, \u201cLet me see what you can do.\u201d So | did. | was\npumping the kerosene back and forth. | did a really great job for him. | was hoping to get\nsomething in return. Nothing, nothing this week. Nothing the next week. Nothing the third\nweek.\n\n| realized what a dummy | must have been doing all the work and not getting anything\nin return. But in the fourth week he said to me, \u201cLittle Juden, next week bring an extra can with\nyou.\u201d So from that point on he used to give me either ate a liter or half-liter extra kerosene.\nThat worked pretty much for a long time. So by using extra kerosene | was able, again to trade\na little bit for something else.\n>> Warren Marcus: And later on there was another exchange.\n>> Nat Shaffir: What happened, in 1942 -- well, this was on for a while. So 1944, there was a\nbig notice put out in the ghetto that anybody between the age of 18 and 50 must assemble in a\ncertain area and to bring warm clothing. Obviously anybody that refuses to assemble, refuses\nto show up, would be punished sometimes by death or sometimes imprisoned. Everybody\nassembled because they knew exactly where everybody lived, which houses everybody lived.\nWe heard everybody needed to bring warm clothing, we knew they were being sent to\nsomeplace else. Also, the notice said they would not be coming back on daily basis. So we\nknew that's what's going to happen. We heard people had been sent to slave labor camps.\n\nSo the day that my father went to the assembly area, we all hugged, cried. We never\nknew when we were going to see my father again if ever. The last minute before he left, |\nasked him If | could walk with him to the assembly area and he said yes. And we walked hand\nin hand. And finally when we get close to the assembly area, he said to me, put his hand on\nmy shoulder and said, \u201cIt's time for you to go back.\u201d He looked at my eyes and said -- I'll never\nforget. He said, \u201cNat, take care of the girls.\u201d Here | am almost 9 years old, putting me in charge\nof taking care of my mother and two sisters. What could | say? | told him, yes, | will. | kept\nwhatever feeling | had -- | didn't want to burst out and cry. | didn't want my father to see me\ncry. So | promised him | would do that.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n11\n\nLater on through all of this period of time that my father was not home | always\nremembered that | promised my father that | would take care of the girls, | would take care of\nthem to make sure they survived. Many times life was very hard. | was ready to give up. But by\ngiving up, that meant neither my sister or my mother would survive. So | kept on going.\n\nOne day when my father was away, | looked for a shirt underneath the bed because\nthat was the closet. | found a bottle of a plum brandy. | took that to the attendant. | wrapped it\nin another shirt because there was no wrapping.\n>> Warren Marcus: To Grigory.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Yeah. | said, \u201c| have a present for you.\u201d | unwrapped the shirt and showed him\nthe bottle. His eyes lit up. So he said to me, \u201cI presume you want some extra kerosene.\u201d | said,\n\u201cNo, actually, | don't. What | would like to have is another ration card for a family of four.\u201d\n\nAnd today | still remember, how could | even have the guts to ask him for something like that.\n>> Warren Marcus: And you're 11 years old.\n\n>> Nat Shaffir: 9 years old.\n\n>> Warren Marcus: 9 years old.\n\n>> Nat Shaffir: So I'm giving him the bottle. A few weeks later he actually came with a ration of\nfour which meant we get another loaf of bread every two days, another five liters of kerosene\nonce a week. So now | had enough stuff to trade with. So that's what happened.\n\n>> Warren Marcus: You certainly were living up to your father's request. At 9 years old, just\nremember.\n\n>> Nat Shaffir: After a while, though, this Grigory took a pity on me, | presume. Sometimes he\ngive me a chunk of cheese or a piece of his bread. He used to tell me, \u201cTake that to your little\nsister.\u201d So obviously | would take that back home and share. After a while, he became\n\nreally -- not a friend but someone | was able to trust a little bit.\n\n>> Warren Marcus: Let me ask you something. When you go through the exhibit today, learn\nabout the Holocaust, you learn about life and death in ghettos, are people in the lasi ghetto\nworried about being taken away\u2019? Is there health, disease issues? What's life like in the ghetto\nin terms of health and daily --\n\n>> Nat Shaffir: There was always a problem -- famine was one of the big problems. We didn't\nhave enough to eat. You went to sleep hungry and woke up hungry. Bathing, had a bath once\na week. There was a public bathhouse. The women were allowed to go on Thursdays and men\non Fridays. Wintertime not so bad but summer time it\u2019s a problem. So disease was a problem.\nThere was no doctors primarily, no medication. There were people dying.\n\n>> Warren Marcus: All at the same time, at 9 or 10.\n\nWhile you're in the ghetto for those years, do you have any conception about what's\nhappening in the outside world in terms of the war or the continued assaults on the Jews of\nEurope? Do you have any knowledge of this or there's no way to know?\n>> Nat Shaffir: We heard certain things filtering into the ghetto, not very precise exactly what\nhappened but we knew something, Jews were being killed, being sent away to concentration\ncamps, from Poland, from Hungary, from different parts of Europe. But we really didn't know\nexactly what happened. But we did hear back and forth certain things.\n>> Warren Marcus: So you knew some of it. OK.\n\nLet's move -- time is getting a little short. Let's move ahead to the end of the war.\nWhat happens with you when the Russians are advancing towards your town? Tell us about\nthat. The ghetto. Excuse me.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n12\n>> Nat Shaffir: Established in the outskirts of the housing with big fields. So when the city was\nbombed, many nights, we would run out to the outside to the field and hide in a ditch. One day,\nbombardments started to come. The city was bombed for three consecutive days. We stayed\nin these trenches. All of a sudden we heard it was quiet. One of the person from the trenches\nlooked out and said we are liberated. So we couldn't understand what happened. He said,\n\u201cLook out.\u201d So we saw in the far end of the field there was individuals with gray coats on, gray\nfur hat with the red stars on their forehead and said these are Russians. So we were liberated\nin the spring of 1945 by the Russians. In all this time we never heard from my father, by the\nway.\n>> Warren Marcus: Still and you have no idea if he's even alive.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Right.\n>> Warren Marcus: So did you think about going back to the farm or did you wait -- tell us\nwhen your dad came back.\n>> Nat Shaffir: We couldn't leave anywhere. My father -- first of all, right after 1945, after the\nRussians came over, individuals started to come back from the same ghetto where they were\nsent out to slave labor camps. So everybody asked have you seen my brother, my father, this\none. So we finally asked have you seen my father. One individual said, yeah, the last time |\nsaw him was about a month ago; he was in good health and chances are he was shipped to\nanother camp. So we hoped if he saw him a month ago, perhaps he's still alive.\n\nSo later on, one day he just showed up. He hitchhiked on Russian convoys, walked a\nlot, farmers. He finally came back to the ghetto area. We were there for a couple of days,\nmaybe a week. Then he said to me we'll go back to the farm and see what happens to our\nfarm.\n\nSo we went back. Before we went to the farm, actually, we stopped at an old farmer\nthat helped us out to thank him for the things that he did for us. The farmer invited us for lunch.\nAfter lunch he said, \u201cWhere are you going from here?\u201d He said -- my father said we're going to\nsee the farm. He said, \u201cI wouldn't do that.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause that's not\nyour farm anymore.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat happened to the farm?\u201d He said the farm was divided into\nthree. The priest and his family got a third of the farm, the police and his family got a third of\nthe farm, and the mayor of the town got a third of the farm.\n>> Warren Marcus: And the mayor.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Yeah. For many years after that my father and | spoke to each other and said,\nWhat makes people do what they do? Why this old farmer risked his life to help us? Why this\npriest who was supposed to really help people turn us in as Jews to the authorities? We could\nnever figure it out. Finally we said it was because maybe monetary reasons or something that\nsomebody could benefit. The farmer did it because he had it in his heart. The priest did it\nbecause he saw opportunity and took tt.\n>> Nat Shaffir: And the same for the mayor and the police who one expect -- like you have an\nexpectation for a faith leader, you have an expectation for law enforcement and government to\nlook after people but not in this case.\n>> Warren Marcus: Now, at the same time, we tried to find out what happened to our family\nback in Hungary. So in March 1944, Germany invaded Hungary. Between April 15, 1944, and\nJuly 9, 1944, 140,000 Jews were deported to Hungary from Italy to Auschwitz. Among the\n240,000 were 33 members of my family, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins. And most of\nthem died. We don't know where, when, or how. Only three people we know for a fact, my\ngrandfather and two of my uncles who was in Auschwitz together at the end. My grandfather\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n13\ndied a month before liberation. He died from starvation. And two of my uncles survived. One\nwas 21 years old, one was 22 years old. They each weighed 65 pounds. So you can imagine\nwhat they looked like when you hear the words skin and bones or walking skeletons. That's\nwhat they were.\n\nWhen the Red Cross came into the camp and saw the condition these people were in,\nthey took them to Sweden, which was a neutral country. Between these two brothers,\nunfortunately one did not make it to Sweden. He died on the way to Sweden. So he was buried\nat sea. And one did survive. He was in a Sweden hospital for four years to get his strength and\nweight back. Finally he emigrated to the United States. And he's the uncle that came to Israel\nto visit. He finally did sponsor me to come to the United States. He is the one that told me\nabout the birthdays that he had. So from 33, immediate family, only one survived.\n>> Warren Marcus: So you were very fortunate. Fairly rare for survivors to maintain a family.\nYou had tremendous losses in the extended family.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Then we realized at that point there's no future for us to stay in Romania. So\nmy father applied for exit visa and the only country that accepted Jewish people at the time\nwas Palestine. We applied at the time to get an exit visa. Every time it came back denied, for\nmany years. Finally, the last chance my father had, he knew an individual that he was dealing\nwith in the Romanian Army. He said, \u201cThis is all I've got, take it. Please give us an exit visa.\u201d\nHe did. So finally 1951 we left for Israel. In Israel, | served in the Israeli Army for three years.\nFinally came back to the United States.\n>> Warren Marcus: Don't be so humble. You were wounded in combat.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Yeah, ok. | was wounded. Then they took me back. My mother was working as\na nurse in the hospital. She didn't Know | was wounded. They brought me back into that\nhospital. When she noticed that I'm the one --\n>> Warren Marcus: She's working at the hospital taking incoming wounded and there's her\nson.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Yeah.\n>> Warren Marcus: Another unbelievable.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Came to the United States in 1961. One thing when | was reading about your\nlife, you got to Israel and that was the first time you saw an orange.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Right. Never saw oranges before. It was a cold country.\n>> Warren Marcus: Besides how hard it was in the ghetto.\n\nYou know what? | think we'd like to end here. Here's what we're going to do from here\non in. Let's take time for some questions. Everything is ok for questions. We'll have\nmicrophones. I'm going to ask you to speak slowly and keep it brief. We're here to learn Nat's\nmemories and stories from his life. And at the end we always give our First Person the last\nword, closing word.\n>> Nat Shaffir: | would like to add one thing.\n>> Warren Marcus: Please.\n>> Nat Shaffir: | did get married. | have five children and 12 grandchildren. Each individual of\nmy children and my grandchildren are named for one of these murdered by the Nazis. My\nsister did the same thing. So all of these people who perished have names after them.\n>> Warren Marcus: Thank you.\n\nOk. Does anyone have questions?\n\nThank you.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n14\n>> Thanks for your great story. In the years that your father applied for the visa, the exit visa,\nand you said it took several years before you finally had to bribe somebody, what did your\nfather do? How did you exist while you waited?\n>> Nat Shaffir: First of all, we left the ghetto and we got a house. My father went back to the\nfarm area with the old farmer. He was able to buy from him 30 heads of cattle, 30 cows. My\nfather always used to tell these people when they came to ask for a loan from my father and\nalways said | don't Know when I'm going to be able to pay you back. My father always told\nthem, \u201cYou'll pay me back when you have it.\u201d So my father told him | don't Know when | can\npay you back. Both farmers said you'll pay me back when you have it. So that's little by little we\nstarted to get back into the same field that they knew and produced some dairy but very little,\non avery small scale.\n>> Warren Marcus: By the way, Nat's had a very successful business career. What a shock,\nhuh? After the black market.\n\nOk. Any other questions? Sonya?\n>> You were talking about your father during the one period of time when he was gone,\nassumedly to a concentration camp or they sent him off somewhere. Did he ever talk to you or\ntell you stories when he came back about where he was and what he experienced in that time\nthat he was gone from your family?\n>> Warren Marcus: He was slave labor.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Right, slave labor camp. They were laying railroad tracks between Romania\nand Russia so the convoys could continue going. So that was pretty hard labor and very little\nfood. So obviously when he came back, he was not the same. He lost a lot of weight. It was a\nslave labor camp.\n>> Warren Marcus: | forgot something | wanted to mention. Can you tell us, were you a very\nreligious family? Did it ever change during these travails in terms of your faith?\n>> Nat Shaffir: For us, our faith, we stayed the same. In other words, we kept the faith because\nthat's the only thing we have to cling on.\n\nJust an example. One time, one of these farmers put a ham in one of these bags that\nwas thrown to my father. We couldn't eat it because we kept kosher. So that was one of the\nthings we traded. That was a good thing to trade with. So we did keep our faith. Many\nunfortunately did not. It was an individuality. Some people did keep their faith. Some did not.\n>> Warren Marcus: So that ham helped you.\n>> Nat Shaffir: It helped.\n>> Warren Marcus: Anyone else?\n>> What was your greatest fear when you were in the ghetto?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Number one, to get sick. | was afraid if | get sick, chances are everything would\ngo downhill from that point on. Obviously there's nothing | could do to stay healthy but that was\none of the fears. The other fear is, you know, what are we going to eat tomorrow. Always a\nproblem. Famine was a big problem in the ghetto. Not enough to eat. And there was no\nmedication. So to make sure my mother survived to make sure | do everything | possibly can\nthe next day. So always thinking of something what to do.\n>> Warren Marcus: At the age of?\n>> Nat Shaffir: 9 1/2.\n>> Warren Marcus: Ok. Just want to be clear.\n>> Hi. My name is Patrick. I'm from Georgetown. Thank you for sharing your story and\nexperience in such vivid detail.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n15\n\nYou suffered tremendous hardship at a very young age. You had to learn a lot really\nfast in the ghetto. My question is, How did that experience actually inform the way you\nconducted your life post liberation whether in Romania, Israel, or in the United States?\n\nThank you.\n>> Nat Shaffir: Could you repeat the question?\n>> Warren Marcus: You somehow got through these difficult hardships. How has that informed\nyour life since then?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Obviously | look at a completely different prism. | see things, people, bad and\ngood. Most of the things | always think on the positive way. | always -- one of my grandsons is\n9 years old. So last year | brought him over here, also in one of these sessions, and | was\nwondering if a child 9 years old today can do what | did 9 years old then. Probably couldn't. So\nit's kind of hard unless a person is in that position.\n\nHow things changed in my life, | always try to help people out no matter what. That's\nmy nature at this point. And | think my sisters do the same thing. Because when we realized\nthe old farmer risked his life to help us, the least we can do, humanity, is pay back somehow. |\nguess it made me a better person.\n>> Warren Marcus: Let's do two more. Maybe.\n>> Did you ever return or visit your farm again?\n>> Warren Marcus: Did you go back to the farm?\n>> Nat Shaffir: We went back one time. After that, since it was divided, we did not. There was\nno reason to go back at this point. We did get compensation from the Romanian government,\nnot really what the farm was worth by all means but some compensation.\n>> How old were you when you came to the U.S. and what were your first impressions when\nyou came?\n>> Nat Shaffir: When | came to the United States, number one, | came in as a visitor. My uncle\nsponsored me. When | saw America, | fell in love like all the immigrants do. | decided | want to\nstay and changed the visa to resident, finally got my green card and eventually became a\ncitizen. | think that's one of the greatest country that we live in. I'm sure all the immigrants that\ncome into this country believe the same way.\n\nActually, I'm one of the youngest survivors. I'm only 81 years old. Most of the survivors\nare in their 90s. So it's kind of hard, you know, to make sure what's happened to all of these\npeople. You get less and less of us almost every month, some of them perish or pass away.\n>> Warren Marcus: What year did you come?\n>> Nat Shaffir: | came in 1961.\n>> Warren Marcus: So you were 25. How's my math? 25?\n\n| guess we can do some more.\n>> What was one of the hardest things you suffered through when you were in the ghettos?\n>> Warren Marcus: What was the worst -- let's just say what was the worst thing in the ghetto\nfor you?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Probably when they took my father away and then all of a sudden left on my\nown, at that age, 9 years old. That was probably one of the worst times.\n>> Warren Marcus: Last one. How about here?\n>> During the years when your father was away, what was your mother doing? Was she still\nwork as a nurse? What was she doing?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Yeah, she was working -- an example what happened. She was working in the\nhospital cleaning up. Then one of the children -- all of a sudden she was cleaning next to the\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n16\n\nbeds and she saw one of the children, his face, turn blue. She tried to call the nurse. In the\nmeantime she tried to revive him. She actually did. It's a good thing that she did when she did\nbecause when the nurse came in, immediately they called the doctor and finally revived the\nchild. That child happened to be the child of the police department officer from the city. When\nhe saw what the mother did, he actually told the nurse, \u201cWhy is she cleaning the floors and the\ntoilets? She should be the nurse.\u201d And she actually was upgraded to an assistant nurse or\nsomething like that. So because she saved -- so sometimes luck has a good impact on what\nhappens -- the outcome of what happens to individuals.\n>> Warren Marcus: Ok. We're going to wrap up the questions. We're almost done. Here's what\n| want to tell. When we're done, there will be time -- Nat will stick around a little while. If you\nwant to come up, shake his hand, give him a hug, take a picture. So we'll get to that ina\nminute.\n\nIt's our tradition, as | said, of First Person, to give our First Person the last word. So\nNat, final words for our guests today?\n>> Nat Shaffir: Many people in many countries kept silent what happened in the Holocaust\nyears, the atrocities committed. They say silence is golden but not when it comes to atrocities\nlike that. We need to speak out. It's our duty and our responsibility to humanity, for all of us, to\nspeak out so atrocities like this will never happen again.\n\nThank you.\n>> [Applause]\n\n",
