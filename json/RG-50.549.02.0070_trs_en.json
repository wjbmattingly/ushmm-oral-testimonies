So they start asking people -- they tried to send out the people from that area, like some people were from Russia, they going back here and there. And I decided to actually go to Russia, cause I didn\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t know about America, if we can go here. So I knew Russians at the time, so I said I was from Minsk, cause I didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland. So they had a truck picking us up, and taking us somewhere, to a train station. And I forgot something, a sweater or something, I went back in the building. When I come, the truck was gone. So I was stranded in Czechoslovakia. And then they deci -- start talking about going to Israel, so they were giving us like false papers, because the English Intelligence was checking so people don\u2019t go to -- which wasn\u2019t Israel then, it was Palestine."
