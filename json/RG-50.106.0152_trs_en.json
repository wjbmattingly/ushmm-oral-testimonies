            "question": "What can you tell me about the day that you realized that you were no longer under Nazi control?",
            "answer": "That day was a very difficult day in our lives because my mother, who was working for the German army, got up in the morning and thought -- it was very quiet out there, we were -- we knew that the -- the Russians were coming closer. We didn\u2019t know where they were and the quiet was just eerie. And she didn\u2019t know whether to go to -- to her job or not. And we were standing talking about it and suddenly a hand grenade split over the -- the house, which I didn\u2019t know at the time, and I s -- hit my hand. I didn\u2019t know what happened, I started screaming like Mother, Mother, my hand. And she realized that I was wounded, and everything went black, we didn\u2019t know what was happening. The house sort of was coming down. And she grabbed my sister, who was only a few years old, and took her in the arms and grabbed me by the hand and we got out of the house. And my hand was bleeding and there was not a soul in the street. She tried to get somebody to pick us up, but nobody would. So I just had to hold her hand and we walked to the hospital, which was at the end of the street. At that time somebody came out of the hospital, picked me up and dragged me off -- took me to the hospital. And -- where they examined my hand. My thumb was cut off, was hanging on a piece of skin, and my little finger was ha -- half cut. My inside of the hand was a complete mess, it was Interview with Halina Peabody , June 3, 2002 just completely open. And they -- there was no penicillin, so they had to sort of clean it as best as they could. They told my mother my ha -- my arm might have to be cut off because of the infection that they expected. And they just put us all up in one bed in the hospital. So that was my day of liberation."

I guess my mother was trying to be close, but not too close, in case she needed to look up somebody, or -- I don\u2019t know why, really, but that\u2019s where we -- we spent the war."

            "answer": "Well, it meant a great frustration because I wanted to say who I was and I couldn\u2019t. And there I was with my hand in a -- on the -- on the railing for two months, and my mother in the meantime -- well, they had to put it on a rail because they -- the hand was -- was going to grow in such a way that I wouldn\u2019t be able to straighten it. It -- it -- it bent like that. If you -- if -- the nuns really saved my hand, because they kept on stretching and stretching. And my mother, in the meantime, was diagnosed with cancer. And so -- they didn\u2019t -- they weren\u2019t even sure a hundred percent if it was cancer, but there was a lump. And they felt that, you Interview with Halina Peabody \u00b0 June 3, 2002 know, they didn\u2019t want us to be orphans, they said, and they told me to go and convince her to have the -- the breast off. So on top of everything else, she had to have her breast off and she had this operation. And we discovered that the lady with whom we had been living during the war was killed by the same hand grenade that - that hit me. So we had no -- no room, no place to go, although the neighbor next door took us in. So my mother spent th-the -- sort of the d-days before she got the operation between the hospital and home and with my sister. And then after she was operated on, she was also in the hospital. I guess my sister was with the lady sometime and sometimes with us in the hospital."

Re-Reuniting with my father after so many years and not knowing him and not knowing, you know, how to Interview with Halina Peabody \u00b0 June 3, 2002 behave. It was a strange world all of a sudden. I really didn\u2019t think about it, I remember Mother saying that no matter what they will -- what kind of sentences they\u2019ll give the Germans is not enough and there is just no kind of punishment that could punish them for what they\u2019ve done."

            "answer": "No. After the war we knew he was alive because my mother got a Red Cross telegram. That is, she didn't get it directly, the people who never survived to tell us anything about what went on, but were killed by the Germans, sent us a letter that there was a communication from my father through the Red Cross that he was alive in Palestine with his sister. So we knew he was alive. We had no idea where exactly he was, but after the war there were announcements all over the place, and my mother put announcements in the radio. And they found him in Palestine. And that\u2019s why he contacted us. He sent my cousin, his nephew who was in the British army in Palestine to Poland to get us out and to put us in touch with the Jewish agency, and that\u2019s how we reunited. We reunited with him somewhere near Munich, after we crossed the Brenner Pass. He came to get us."

And apparently Stalin made this agreement at Yalta that they would let out the prisoners, all the prisoners out. However, he tells us that he had to run away and -- and found -- find a way to get out with the Polish army. He was in Siberia."

And we kept missing him. We kept trying to find him and we didn\u2019t know where he was exactly, but we knew he was alive. He lost his wife and daughter, who was exactly my age. And he was the only one that survived in Poland. The others -- whoever -- whoever else was in Poland did not survive, in my family, but my aunt, uncle and cousin who were taken to Russia, to Siberia, Interview with Halina Peabody \u00b0 June 3, 2002 also survived.

            "question": "After your liberation, when you st-started moving to different places, did you have much contact with other survivors?",
            "answer": "Personally, no. My mother went to Krakow and tried to track, as I said, everybody down. There was no room for us in Krakow, so she found a -- a small Interview with Halina Peabody \u201d June 3, 2002 place to live in, very close to one of the village near Krakow. Again they asked her directly if she was Polish, meaning was she Jewish and she had to say she was Polish. So again we were under the assumed names, and again we had to cover up. I went to school there. It was very strange, I was the only one who could read and write. And my mother went to the Jewish agency, and strangely enough, I don\u2019t know why it is, but she only registered herself as being alive, never put the children down. They were very surprised that she had two children, that she managed to survive with two children. I never went to the Jewish com -- agency, as far as I remember, I think she went by herself, but I may have forgotten. Very -- something very strange happened there because an old friend of hers who was remarried to a Catholic man and had big cross on her breast, said to her that my hand happened because I became a Catholic without being baptized. I\u2019ve never -- never forgotten that, my mother was absolutely infuriated and sort of stuck in my mind that some of us were not perfect."

            "question": "How long was it before you were able to -- to freely admit that you were really Jewish, and use your own name?",
            "answer": "Well, it was when we manage -- when we finally got into the Jewish agency groups and everybody was Jewish. However, there was another little wrinkle. They thought we were not Jewish and they tried to say that my mother was trying to get Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Halina Peabody \" June 3, 2002 out of Poland under the guise of being Jewish and that she really wasn't, and we were not. So she had to try to convince them that she really was Jewish. And there we were, you know, trying to convince them we are Jewish. And finally -- all she would say was that my -- her husband\u2019s name was Isaac. And finally some people who knew us from Krakow did sign that -- sign off on us, that we were legitimate."

            "question": "You said you were with the Jewish agency groups. Where were you exactly? Can you clarify that?",
            "answer": "Yes, we were in sort of group homes, they -- they had us in groups and they were going to transport us out one -- one group at a time. It was somewhere near Krakow, I -- I don\u2019t know, 1s closer to the German border. And what happens was - was that they took one group after a time, they took pregnant and old -- elderly people first. The Russians had a sort of agreement that they would let us through, but they liked to be paid on the border, so they always had prepared money and there was a Polish guy, then a Russian guy, then they kind of closed their eyes to us, but -- but you had to still pay your way through. The first lorry that went out got caught, and apparently they were put back into some other camp and then they were let go. They didn\u2019t really want to keep us, but the second one went through and the problem was that before we got onto the truck, they attacked us at night, the Polish militia. And they wanted t-to -- to probably rape an-and steal from us, I don\u2019t know. Interview with Halina Peabody \" June 3, 2002 We had to stand there and scream on top of our lungs in order for them to go away. We were lucky that they in -- in the end they went. In the morning they turned up and said, oh, what was the problem, we heard there were noises. But we knew exactly what it was, so we were just looking forward to getting out. It was a very strange, very strange time. Strange time. The last -- the -- when we ca -- got out, we- they put us out wha -- three kilometers past the frontier. Once my mother gave up her watch because the Russians wanted watches in addition to whatever they got. And then another guy gave his watch up. So we got through and then the German refused to sell us tickets. We were supposed to buy tickets in the train and then get to Berlin on our own accord. And the leaders went to buy tickets and the Germans didn\u2019t want to sell them to us because we were Jews. I don\u2019t know what they did in the end, but we did get on the train and we did get to Berlin. We were in the Russian sector first and they tried to also establish that we were Jewish. They took two or three people and had them sign their name in Hebrew. And the -- then they came back and it was okay. We went from there to the British section and then to the American section, we were kind of carted around. And in the end they sent us on to DP camp in Italy."

            "answer": "Yes, it was -- there were two near Ancona, there was Trani and Barletta. And we did not spend much time there, but have quite nice memories. I remember the music. And well, I -- as I said, we were young and we wanted -- we were happy to be alive. It was a -- it was a better time. The weather was beautiful, we had food, and my father told them explicitly to keep us there as long as possible, to have us recover in the nice weather and the good food. My father, who was a dentist, had privilege in the hospital there and so we used to go and have our meals at the hospital. My mother taught us to swim there in the -- in the gorgeous sea, you know, and we had a very pleasant time. The food was marvelous, the -- the -- the cherries particularly, just absolutely wonderful. And the ice cream, I\u2019ve never tasted- maybe because it was after the war and we were so hungry, but never tasted anything like it. And it was -- it was very pleasant pastime. Unfortunately, because my father asked them to send us late -- last, they sent us first to England, because we chose -- my father and my mother decided that out of the choices, Palestine or England, we should go to England. So they sent us 1n a very cold time to England. It was not -- not a very happy experience to begin with."

            "answer": "There was no such thing as rehabilitation for anything in those days as far as I know. What I did get was some help from the teachers, who tried to accommodate my -- both the lack of no -- knowing English and my lack of thumb, to do subjects that would make it easier for me. And that\u2019s why they immediately switched me to commercial subjects like shorthand, which meant that I didn\u2019t have to spell, and typing, which means I learned how to spell by copying. And then also arranged for me -- showed me how to use my fingers so that I wouldn\u2019t need the thumb or the little finger, so that I could type. And I did type over a hundred words a minute at one point, so I -- I did pretty well on that. And I also found that I could knit, which I could before the war, before I lost my thumb. And whatever I could do before, including even cutting my cuticles, I found I could do. At one point they decided they wanted to help me and they got me to a doctor and the doctor was going to try Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Halina Peabody me June 3, 2002 to do something with my hand, they wanted to adjust my -- one of my fingers so that I could use it as a thumb. I don\u2019t know, it was -- it was a very difficult situation. My mother didn\u2019t know what to tell me cause she was in such pain about this, and w -- I ended up being in the hospital and already the -- getting the first shot before the anesthesia and I said no, I don\u2019t want to do it, and I just got out. And I said I -- you know, I just got off the bed and -- and thanked them and -- and never tried that one again. I felt that it was just too difficult and I\u2019m glad I did because my instinct just told me not to. But other than that my rehabilitation was mainly my own doing. The other thing I did was play table tennis, which meant that I was easier with the company I was in. I liked the company of boys, which was easier [indecipherable] to play table tennis. And plus, when you play a -- a sport like table tennis or any other sport, you have no time to think of your hand. You know, I used to stand with my hand in the back so that it doesn\u2019t show. But when you play, you know, you have to serve, you have to put your ball up and -- and you -- you have to look at the ball, so you don\u2019t have time for the hand. And that, I think, is my cure. That was my cure."

That was before I was playing table tennis, and it -- it was a miserable time. The weather is miserable in England. It was cold, I was always cold, and rainy. I didn\u2019t have enough clothes really and it was hard getting used to being a family with Father again. We were so used to being with just Mother and plus, during the war I was the -- the s -- the second partner, you know, and then after the war I was a child again. It was very uncomfortable. And we struggled, because when they decided to come to London, we bought a house. The way you bought a house that time, all the refugees wanted a house to have roots, but you lived in a -- one level and you rented out the rooms at the top so that you could pay the mortgage. So it was a hard life. And my mother didn\u2019t realize that by law I had to go to school, so before we came to London, she and my sister went first to look for the house and she broke down in one of the schools because they said that they had no room for me. And -- and th-the director took pity on her and said he s -- he\u2019Il send her to another school in Fulham, which is southwest London, where they did Interview with Halina Peabody June 3, 2002 accept me. It was a very nice -- it was actually a girls\u2019 school. And the headmistress, Dr. Toms, I\u20191l never forget. She was a very -- very lovely lady. And so they accepted me there, but when they moved to the house -- when we went to [indecipherable] London, she insisted I continue going to s -- to Fulham, which meant about an hour on the underground every day, cause she was so afraid that they -- I wouldn\u2019t get education. So it was a hard time. I liked school, and they weren't having any -- any excuses there, you know. I said I didn\u2019t know enough English to do my homework and they said never mind, just keep trying. So I ended up really doing just as well as any other, and as I said, because I was on commercial subjects, I did pretty well. In fact, I did -- I think I was one of the first pupils in -- in school that passed the shorthand test. So I was happy in that, from that point of view, but living at home was difficult. We -- as I said, we struggled every week, there was not enough money for anything. My father was able to practice dentistry in -- in the army, but not in England. He wasn\u2019t -- his -- his education wasn\u2019t a-a- apparently sufficient, so he was a difficult situation too. So it was not -- not an easy time at all. My mother was miserable. She felt very much an incomplete person because of her operation for cancer. And she was very, very unhappy and that made me unhappy because, you know, I loved my mother very much. I did realize what Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Halina Peabody \u201c June 3, 2002 she did for us during the war, I mean, she just absolutely used up every inch of her strength and I think she didn't have much strength left in her to fight."

Israel is a small country. He felt that in his profession, he needed a little more air. So we thought we\u2019d come for a year, at least that was the plan. We rented our apartment and came with the best hope. He also wanted to go to school if possible, and I was supposed to go to work.

So in the end we went out to Palo Alto and that\u2019s where we spent two and a half years and -- and he actually did some very good work at the Hoover Institute. He was the first Israeli to work there and the local Jewish community was very nice to us and very interested in what we were about and wanted to know more about us. This was part of the Jewish community that was never very much involved with Interview with Halina Peabody \u201c June 3, 2002 Israel and that was a time that they suddenly awa -- awoke to the fact that Israel was something that would be of interest to them. And so we had a very, very nice social life there. And he did very well. He did very well, but then he changed, he went to work for San Francisco Examiner, and after awhile he felt that the only way to complete his rise in the -- in the profession, he had to come east. So that\u2019s -- after two and a half years we moved back to Washington and he went to work for Voice of America."

It was a long, long way away and I thought that 1t was going to be strange, but I saw the Hollywood films and I thought that couldn\u2019t be like that. Turned out it was, almost, you know, and people had three cars in the family, I thought they were lying, but that\u2019s how it 1s, they do. We do. And the thing that struck me about the United States was how beautiful it was. And they never -- Americans who travel abroad never tell you how beautiful America is, they just complain. And the vastness of it. Th-The -- the size, th-the width and th-the breadth of it, 1t\u2019s just amazing because we come from Europe, small countries, you know, you go for a few ki-kilometers and you\u2019re at the border of one country and another country.

Not nice maybe, but after what we\u2019ve been through we felt very -- I felt very relieved and -- and I needed the rest from all the problems. So that was nice. We had other struggles because we had, obviously, to make a living, and my son went to school, and that was alright. He learned English very, very fast, so that was not a problem.

So when my husband decided to go abroad on a mission, he went -- he went into the foreign service. And that was the time when we really broke up, because he was going to Yugoslavia then, and there was no American school in Yugoslavia, so it would have meant that I had to send my son to an American school in Italy or in Israel and I would have to go to Yugoslavia with him and I certainly couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t have done that.
