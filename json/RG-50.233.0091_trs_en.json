But in Europe ,especially 50 years ago, you went to a store first and you bought the material. Then you had to look for a tailor. So when they finished the material, the material went to the stores. The people went in and said I need material for a suit. Man rolled it open, says, how much do you need? He brought the measurements to the tailor.

You felt like an outsider, like you were not part of the process and things like that. So it\u2019s different. They had a quota, they had a quota in school, they had a quota in the military. A Jew couldn\u2019t be a high official in the government. Maybe from the Jewish district, he was elected, a representative, but that\u2019s about--he couldn\u2019t be a high official, appointed.

Friday was market day, especially with the Jewish people. They went to buy the stuff for the Sabbath. There wasn\u2019t like a grocery store. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was eight, nine o\u2019clock; the weather was crisp; everybody was talking about the war. I looked up the sky and I saw these planes with the top that time because the war hysteria was going already a week or two weeks before mobilization, talk about the Germans and things like this. On Friday, nothing happened to our city. The planes flew over in the morning. They were just like birds up in the sky, the sun was shining. Saturday, the planes came back again and the Poles were shooting up. You could see the tracer bullets, you don\u2019t know if you hit them or not. The planes flew right over, flew higher, nothing reached them. But Sunday, they flew very low. They came very low over the city and you could even see the pilot inside, very, very low. The city was in a panic. Everybody was going towards Warsaw. The Poles appealed to the populations, to able- bodied men, to go toward Warsaw. We\u2019re going make a defense line over there, a stand. My father left too. I remember we marched all night, 54 left Zgierz, we left for the city. We went to a nearby village. I don\u2019t remember how many miles, maybe ten miles, 15 was a village. Everybody was just like -- refugees. We took a few possessions, a little bit of bread. At night, we got very scared because the Poles opened all the prisons and they let out all the inmates. I don\u2019t know if they were political inmates or criminal inmates but you see a lot of people, they look like hoodlums with shaved heads. That night, my father left. He went toward Warsaw."

At that time, everything was disorganized already. It didn\u2019t take long for the Poles to get disorganized already. It didn\u2019t take long for the Poles to get disorganized. They didn\u2019t send you a summons, you have to report. They just broadcast, by word of mouth that all able bodied men who had served in the Polish army at one time or another had to report towards Warsaw. They named the city Lovitz or something, we\u2019re going to make there a defense. Me and my brother and my mother were left alone. We figured well, we cannot defend ourselves. We have no clothes, nothing; we just left in a hurry. We went back towards Zgierz, our city. On the way, we encountered the Polish army coming back, disorganized, disheveled with horses with wagons, some on foot. I didn\u2019t see any mechanized unit, none whatsoever. We came back to our home and the neighbors said they were glad to see us back, even though they were Poles. They gave us milk and bread and things like that. I wasn\u2019t there maybe one hour or two, I heard shooting. My neighbor who was a man, he didn\u2019t run away because he owned a farm nearby. He said the Germans are coming. He probably got wind of it before. We were into like a shelter. I don\u2019t know if it was a shelter or maybe an empty cellar, I don\u2019t know. We were there for a few hours, we heard shooting, then we came out and the Germans were here. The next morning, we went outside and we saw strange uniforms, not like the Polish army. We saw a lot of looting, knocking off the stores, everything was in disarray. We see whole columns of Germans going towards Warsaw. They were passing our town because Warsaw was north of where we were living"

One of the Jews, he was really from Lodz, he worked at Zgierz and he was commuting because he came with the tramway every morning. We find out that he has a lot of-- he knew a lot of people, he\u2019s got a lot of pull. My father went to him and asked him if he can help us out; we need some quarters where to live. He sure did. We got that room because apartments were very scarce. They put in the Jews from the city of Lodz itself, from all the environs. They put them in a small section and it was the worst section, the most dilapidated section in the city. They assigned us a Jewish quarter. We had one room, just one room. It served as a kitchen and everything, just one room for four people. Then -- that was in -- yeah, also for the refugees who came from the environs, they opened public kitchens. This was all in the fall of 1939. I even remember the next Passover which was the next spring like April now, was still the public kitchens, we eat in the public kitchens because we were refugees.

One section of the ghetto, the cemetery was adjoining it. There was a lot of black market going on and you still could buy food but then times were getting bad. Then the Germans requested people for a settlement; it was getting crowded. They brought more people in from the surrounding vicinities from smaller towns. They were liquidating the ghetto and then they were coming into the Lodz ghetto. As soon as the ghetto got crowded, now I\u2019m reading the books, I know how it was. At that time they were opening the camp in Kaldum, Humhof, the extermination camp. They had to feed the camp, the factories. Ostensibly, they were taking -- they were taking some people out for work too, on road crews, healthy men. But they were also taking out people who were sick. They sent to different camps."

They put them in ghettos, they concentrate them in centers but I think the Wannsee started a little bit later on, in 1942.

They had relatives; there were mixed marriages and mixed partners maybe who didn\u2019t come to the ghetto and they sent packages.

When I mentioned it, the Germans put a curfew for a week, they took in, from block to block, they took in with the wagons. They took them to an assembly point and then the Germans came and took them with trucks or they marched to the train station.

They said we need 7,000 people for the settlement, we need 900,000, 50 hundred people so if some people came from Germany,, from Austria and they were strangers; they were not even resettled yet, they were just living in a building, they just took them.

            "answer": "They told them they would settle in the east. The ghetto, like I said, was quite a large area and they had like a central prison, the Jews. The people had assembled there, like I said, but some people, they really went for work outside the ghetto. Because they had to go to a commission; they had German doctors and they really needed them to work. But if they took everybody, whole families, you know they didn\u2019t take these people to work. They just said you have to be resettled in the east. Like I said, I was hiding; then one day after maybe a week\u2019s time or so, I had to report. So I was there for three, four days in the central prison. I remember my father came the last days towards the barbed wire. I remember the picture just like vividly. I remember what he looked like. In Europe he was wearing boots and I remember his face like -- . So we march, the next morning we march to the train station, we marched, all young people, no adult with us. Youngsters, I was there maybe sixteen, seventeen already. They put us in an open cart, put us in one of the good wagons, cattle cars and they closed up. We were riding for two, three hours. All of a sudden, they open the door. There was a truck waiting there and the Germans waiting there. I don\u2019t remember how many people, maybe 50 people from our wagon, whatever it was. Maybe 50, maybe 60, I didn\u2019t count them; they took us to a labor camp. It was in Kielce. It was in southern Poland. It\u2019s spelled K-1-e-l-c-e. I don\u2019t know if you heard of it before. They took us over there and we asked how -- I seen them loading up our clothes, our baggage. We had on the truck and then -- they had already a labor camp. That camp still had Jews already from the surrounding vicinities. The camp was adjoining a factory. The factory was called Hasac. It was a Polish munitions factory before the war or maybe it was just a metal factory, I don\u2019t know. The Germans converted this to a munitions factory. Over there, in comparison to the ghetto, was good because I had plenty food, as much as I want. The only this, you came in contact with the Poles. You work in the factory besides with the Poles. So we went to the barracks after finish the work but they went to their homes. They promised us that they going to give us the clothes, I seen them loading the truck. We ask them, where is the clothes, we never got the clothes. I only had what I had on me. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Yeah, I didn\u2019t have -- that\u2019s right. I seen them loading the truck but when I got to the camp, I never see anything. I had an extra sweater, maybe an extra pants, an extra pair shoes. We were all probably gone for labor work so everybody took a little bit clothes. They never gave it to us. This was good clothes because we took nothing but the best. I could barter this if I had it. I remember I just had one sweater, some I give it away and the Pole, the next day, brought me a loaf of bread or something like that. But food was relatively good because the locals, they were locals in the adjoining cities and they probably came with all the clothes. They were bartering all the time so they didn\u2019t eat in the commune kitchen. Was always a lot of food. Then at night, I could go to the Polish kitchen if they had food left over, they gave us if I worked the night shift. In comparison to the ghetto, as far as food was concerned, was gold. I was always worried about what happened to my parents, everything seemed unreal. I got up in the morning, everything strange. I worked in the factory; I was making bullets. We put in steel and the machines, if you\u2019re working steel with the machines, had to have oil, constant to the oil. Like I said, I don\u2019t have any clothes to exchange nothing so got all over me and I developed all blisters. I had all blisters on my knee, on my feet. Because I had no apron, just plain clothes and I had nothing to change. Don\u2019t forget I mentioned that I had left in March, 1944 but then the weather was getting colder. I went out in the morning to work. They marched us from the assembling, we had to march to factory. We didn\u2019t have to march too far, just like from here to the light because the camp was attached to the factory. But a cold day, it hit my flesh and it was hurting because I had blisters. When I was in that labor camp in Kielce, I heard about the invasion, the Normandy invasion in June 6. I heard that. But that time, I really didn\u2019t know where Normandy was; I just heard that the Americans and the British was there, I don\u2019t have any perception of time; maybe the camp, maybe two, three months. It was the summer and then one morning, this camp, we were guarded by the Ukrainians. A Ukrainian auxiliary this camp. You mentioned if somebody escaped from the ghetto and I told you I didn\u2019t know of anybody. But from the camp, I did heard that they escaped, from the labor camp. But they caught him and then they brought him back and then they shot him. It was a different part of the country, they did escape and they brought him back. This was still in the summertime, after the Normandy invasion. It was in June, maybe July or maybe August, one morning they lined us all up and they say they have to evacuate because the Russian made the offensive. They were coming westward so they evacuated us and they put us in open flatcars. We were riding maybe a day or two and then they let us out in an open field. They gave us food; the Germans were debating where they should take us. They didn\u2019t know what to do with us -- all the people from the labor camp. Was not a big camp, maybe six, seven hundred people. As I mentioned before, only about 50, 60 people. They had the whole wagons left over but they dropped them off in different camps. This camp only attached this car, maybe away to another couple cities, attached like a camp. They didn\u2019t know where to take us, we said why can\u2019t we go back -- we still in Poland -- we said why can\u2019t you take us back to the Lodz ghetto? There\u2019s a lot of Jews over there. One of the guys told us, the Lodz ghetto is being evacuated, dismantled now. Right now, we in the field, 1t was still warm, must have been in August. Now This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection according to the books that I read, that was when the ghetto was being liquidated, in July and August. After a couple of days, we decided and they took us to a place, Shedbush. We still in Poland, I find it on the map, wasn\u2019t far away, maybe 25 miles away. Anyway it was all youngsters and we were digging ditches, anti-tank ditches. The organization Todd was in charge, T-o-double-d. It was named after a German, it was a labor battalion or something like that. We came, in the morning, in the daytime we went to dig the ditches and at night we were sleeping in barns, in farmers\u2019 barns. But at night, we heard shooting. In the morning we got up and we ask the German what is all the shooting? We heard the partisans, they were attacking the German units or something like this in the countryside. So after we dig the ditches, I don\u2019t know, maybe for a week or so, they took us away to Chintzerhau . The Chintz 1S a -- | think it\u2019s near Upper Silesia -- it\u2019s a very well known Polish city. The Polish Madonna -- Chintz is on the Polish-German border not far away in Upper Silesia. The same factory with the same work that I did in Kielce that I did in Chintz . Over there, I met my friend. I met my friend which I still keep up to now; he is in New York."

Over there maybe you worked about maybe for a month or two, was all , 1944, remember. We went in the morning --. He wasn\u2019t in Kielce with Gara; he was in a different camp. He was in Scarzilsco. By then, when the Germans came, they evacuated everybody and every able- bodied men they put in --. He came in Chintz and I met him. We were working in the same factory. I don\u2019t know if we worked there for a month or six weeks. Anyway, it was still the same year; the Germans came one morning, rounded us up and marched us to the train station. They put us on cattle cars and I could see that the local population, they were running. We heard distant shooting. I don\u2019t know, rumors spread in our ranks that the Russians are entering the city on the other side but it wasn\u2019t true yet. I could see the Germans were loading the big guns on the trains, the German army. Anyway they put us on cattle cars. We were gone for three or four days and we wind up in Germany. We find out that they took us \u2014 we went to Buchenwald in the concentration camp. Over there they opened up, we came to Buchenwald and everybody was eating up whatever they had in the food packages with them. They were discarding the Polish money and the German Reich marks. After two, three hours, we went to sit in barracks. They had -- Buchenwald was a big camp, was about 60,000 inmates at that time. It was established early in 1933. Right now, I know it was a political camp. In Buchenwald heather on the ground. But that time I didn\u2019t realize, I didn\u2019t realize that. Anyway we registered and all the inmates did all the work. They ask us where we come from, your mother\u2019s name, your father\u2019s name and all this stuff. After registration, we went to a big hall. We had to take all the clothes that we wear and before I left Poland, I mentioned that before I left the ghetto, my mother told me that you have an aunt in Paris which I did have, her sister. She says you have a cousin in Belgium and she gave me addressed envelopes and things like that and says maybe you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. Maybe you\u2019re going to need it one day. But when I went to Buchenwald and I had family pictures, my mother, my younger brother, I had to put everything on the table. All the clothes, everything on the table and I only remember one German. A black uniformed German came in, we all had to 0 to commission. He looked at my legs because like I said, from the dirty oil, I don\u2019t know what I blubbered up in German. He says, he just looked at me and was thinking, thinking. He just motioned at a line so I went over there. We had to go in first to a shower.

Water was coming out and then we had to all to go in. They had a big disinfection tube, was maybe like this room. Had to jump in, oh I had all scabs over here -- was burning and burning. Before this, I forgot, after I took all the clothes off and everything, we went to a different room. The inmates were all, the inmates had clippers. They clipping the head, clipping hair, clipping hair, all over there. Then we were all clipped up. We had to jump into this tub, this disinfect thing. Oh, it was burning something terrible. Then we jumped out. This was January, was already January. knows, January 18, according to the record, I got there, January 18. We went up from this tube, oh yeah, after we got up from the tube, I remember going up a flight of stairs. They gave me clothes. They gave me a pair boots, shoes, no socks. They gave me pants but no underwear. They gave me a jacket but no shirt. I didn\u2019t have the striped jacket, just because, don\u2019t forget, it was January and it was already chaos in all those camps. They had so many people come from Germany, I didn\u2019t even have a tattoo. I just had an assigned number. They gave me all these clothes. Then we went out to the other end of the barracks where we stand for two, three hours until we assigned a barrack. Here it\u2019s January, it\u2019s cold."

I didn\u2019t know what the word kapo means but I know people came to us and he says you people are newcomers? I says yes. I says who is your leader. We called, one was a Jewish policemen in the labor camp was this. They want to find out how we are treated .If we told him; we are treated by our own people, they kill him on the spot. Because they say we want to do an example, in case they take your people out for labor for a day or two to the city and somebody is going to inform on you, your own people; when he comes back, he\u2019s going to have the same thing. He says we\u2019re organizing the thing. I remember one guy, he was the head of the camp. He came to us and says, don\u2019t say anything bad. Because we always thought maybe we came from the ghetto from Lodz, they didn\u2019t give us our clothes, we could have lived better. Buy different food, but I don\u2019t know what happened to him. Maybe somebody else squealed on him, maybe not, I don\u2019t know. I was in that camp and then I met my friend, it was nice. The first day, when I assigned my rations, I put it in my pocket. I figure I\u2019m going to eat it later on. You get one day of rations, a piece of bread and a bowl of soup so I figure I\u2019m going to eat the bread at night. So at night, I went to eat, the bread was gone. Somebody slipped it out and I didn\u2019t feel it. I figured out, don\u2019t ask me know but I don\u2019t know. I remember one thing, I sewed up my pockets. Don\u2019t ask me where I got the needle and where I got the thread. Somebody must have had it.

Sometimes, we stayed for two, three hours in the snow, don\u2019t forget it was January. The snowflakes they were falling; he counted us up, then dismissed. Then dismisses, you went into a cold barrack. If you had a piece of bread left over in the morning, you ate it. If not, nothing. In daytime, in the morning, we heard a whistle blowing. They took us for work, from the barracks, just to drag wood because you have to remember that Buchenwald was carved out from a forest. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar or not. It\u2019s ten miles away from Weimar. It\u2019s a lot of birch trees and forest. Maybe they need the wood, maybe they didn\u2019t need it. They just make you work.

Then they have this kapo, lined up, like I said, Russians, Germans, and you had to approach. If they recognize a Jew, you\u2019re on this side in there.

Then I met my friend. He was hiding too, he was in a different barracks. Finally they says, everybody has to go. So everybody has to go, alright. So we line all up and we went to the main camp to Buchenwald. They kept us there in a big hall. Don\u2019t ask me what kind, I remember it was a big hall, they kept us overnight and the next day too. Towards dusk, they says, now we\u2019re going to go to the train station. They let us out from the big, looked like a factory type building. I would recognize it now.

Then the planes came and shot up again. So they assembled us all in columns I don\u2019t know, maybe 5,000 people. Don\u2019t forget they say they empty Buchenwald, not all of them. They marched us to Flossenburg. This is another camp. I don\u2019t know how you spell Flossenburg, it\u2019s near Weiden. Right now I\u2019m reading all the books. I\u2019m interested because I lived this period; I know that right now from history was a criminal camp. One of the German, Admiral Kanaris, he was head of the German Upfeur, German intelligence. He got hung up over there. In the middle of the story or not. Over there, was even worse than Buchenwald because we were sleeping --. I was with my friend there from New York and we sleeping that camp maybe for a week or so. Then they say they evacuated Flossenburg. Thy marched us out from Flossenburg to the train. That was in the morning, maybe eleven o\u2019clock. I think it was on a Sunday, I don\u2019t know why I remember Sunday but I have stuck in my head, Sunday. I know the sun was shining high and the train station was right outside of the camp and they loading us in open boxcars, listen to that. The trains didn\u2019t even start moving yet. All of a sudden, I see planes from far away. Big planes in the sky and the sun shines on them, I think that was the jet age coming out. In a second, they were right over the train -- shot everything up. All of a sudden, I heard something hit my face. I asked my friend, do I have blood on my face? He just looked, he says no. But I looked up and I see that we were not moving yet. They had a big sign, crossing written down in German, made out of wood. A crossing sign, you know, maybe one of the splinters, some bullet too, hit me in the face. But nothing was bleeding, it was nothing, something hit me. When the planes shot up the train, everybody jumped off the train so I jumped off the train too. The Germans were running to the farmhouses, to the nearby houses. I run after them too. I heard them, run into German, must have been a German house or something, I wasn\u2019t the only one, maybe there were dozens of legs, we run with the guards."

I was in the first line over there. We marched all night, me and my friend from New York. Then at night, we wind up near the roadside and we took a little bit leaves and they says you\u2019re going to spend the night over there. The next night the same thing. But the third night, was raining bad. I got soaked all through, all wet. Whoever fell out of line, if you read the story about Bataan or Corregidor, the same thing.

Towards morning, it was already daybreak, we stopped on a farm and they put us in barns. They says you\u2019re going to rest here, the guards. All of a sudden, decide to take us all out for punishment because somehow, somebody, they were messing up the barns. There were no toilets there. They were lining everybody up. They going to take us to a march or maybe, who knows. The Germans had a tendency. If somebody did any infractions, they lined everybody up and they picked people at random. They lined them up and they says I\u2019m going to pick every third man, or every tenth man. They just pull them out and they just shot them just for no reason at all. So maybe they tried to do the same thing this time. When they were getting ready, everybody lined up, we heard shooting. So the German says everybody back inside the barn. Then the shooting intensified. Like I mentioned, it\u2019s a barn. A barn has slits so some of the inmates looked --. Before I mention that, for some reason an egg fell down, a chicken egg fell down and my friend was nearby. We took the egg and we split it in half, a fresh egg. While we were sitting in the barn, like I mentioned before, it was raining all night and the barn is warm near the hay and the straw, our clothes is steaming. We heard the shooting and we looked out. Some of the inmates says, the Russians are here. They saw the stars. At that time, we didn\u2019t know the American tanks have stars too. We know the Russians have stars.

There 1s a sizeable Jewish community in Furt. Furt, it\u2019s Bavaria too. It\u2019s spelled F-u-r-t. We took the streetcar from Nuremberg and you went to Furt. They had Jewish community there and they were all newcomers and had a home too. Just like a house but I was not living in this house. I think we all had a tent to ourselves, was handy there. At that time came to go too. So they said they\u2019re going back to the United States but before they say, they pack for their vacation. They going to leave from Marseilles, France. So they had two choices. We can either leave you in Germany and find you another job with the American army or we can give you back to France. At that time France was right after post-war in \u201945, they could bring across the border. You know in \u00b045, is everything chaos still.

They give letters of recommendation, 381*' Evacuation Hospital or something like this. We decide to work over there and they give us quarters and they give us food. Like I said, we had all the clothes, we had a room. Inside, was no tents, already in the hospital, had separate rooms, three, four boys. In the morning, we just went to work in the kitchen.

He told me he heard -- heard a lot of the people who are liberated, they go to America. They have relatives but I didn\u2019t have anybody so nothing to claim.

They were liberated or some maybe were never in a camp; they were mixed marriages and maybe the Germans didn\u2019t touch them. Anyway I went once to a service in Nuremberg, Jewish service.

I got a response like in a post office box. I went to look at the room and the room was right near the Palace of Justice, near the military tribunal, where they tried the Nazis. As a matter of fact, the building was right across the street, I seen the Soviets on the balcony. They were living there too. The people who were attached to the Justice, to the Russian delegation. Anyway I looked at the room and the lady asked me what I do. I told her I am working at the hospital. She says yeah? I says I\u2019m Jewish. She says oh, yeah. After the war, everybody had a Jewish relative. She says you know what, I registered this room, she says, with the government because I don\u2019t want them to assign me a newcomer from -- an ethnic German from the displaced, from Schlis _ or something like this. If you can get it, if somehow you can bring a certificate that you want the room. I made contact with this German ministry. I tell him, listen I have a room but I need assignment. No problem, he gave me an assignment, I was living over there. Then my papers came through. They call me to the council. I had to give the birth certificate. I don\u2019t have a birth certificate, if you come from Europe, everything was taken away. That was relatively easy, you find people from your hometown. They know I\u2019m from Poland so I had this witnesses where I was born, where I\u2019m from and I assembled different papers. We get them translated into English. I went for the interview. Finally I got to America."

So I read all about it. I came on the ship . It took us eight days. I didn\u2019t get sick on the boat, a lot of people sick around me. The boat came to New York harbor like in the evening. All of a sudden when you come from Europe, from post-war Europe and we were outside in the harbor, we didn\u2019t go into New York harbor. We just stayed there overnight but you could see the cars moving, they looked like, it\u2019s a sight when you come from Europe and you don\u2019t see all the streets and the lights and fire way over --. Everything is alive, you see New York City. Especially when you see from far away. Maybe it was five miles away, out to the harbor. We stayed overnight on the boat. When the mist start lifting in the morning, I don\u2019t know whether it was August, it got daylight maybe 5 o\u2019clock, maybe 5:30 , I don\u2019t know, it was already mist. I went outside. We couldn\u2019t sleep already all night, passed the Statue of Liberty. I read of the Statue of Liberty in the book so I knew the Statue of Liberty. We passed it and the boat anchored. Then immigration came on the board. We had papers and everything. I became legitimate. We didn\u2019t go to Ellis Island. They put a pin on my lapel. I came through the Joint distribution. Somebody sponsored me but I don\u2019t know who did. It came tShe group but somebody must have did it. They had different nationalities.

I have my best clothes from Germany after the war. I have a suit on and lapel. The hall empties and nobody is approaching me. Nobody. I wait and wait.

They must have spot me the way I\u2019m dressed. They coming towards me and I had to see the boat. They had a car, they all volunteers. To me they probably wait. Maybe they couldn\u2019t find any volunteer, were late. We walk out Union Station and the first thing you see is the Capitol. I says this is the White House? No, they correct me, that is the Capitol. It never made any difference to me why is the Capitol so white. It all depends on which angle you look at the White House, at the portico, it looks like Capitol too. Anyway we got in their car and they took me to 18\" Street, near the zoo over there. It was a boarding house and they says you going to be here. They told me the next day, leave it to the Jewish Social Service Agency. They wrote down the address. The Jewish Social Service Agency at that time was on Spring Road which is right at 14\" Street. There was no suburbs then and being I was Columbia Road, right near the zoo which is Adams-Morgan now and Spring Street is not --. They gave me the address, I can take the bus. Over there, I was --- the lady she had lot a -- the Jewish Social Service paid her money. She put newcomers up with food. She gave me a room, she had a rooming house.

He asked me what I did and the war, where I\u2019m from, relatives, no relatives. He gave me $20 in my pocket. So I had $3 plus $20; I had $23. With $23, they says here\u2019s $20 and you will sightsee. They want me to go to the city, transportation because they put me up with food so I didn\u2019t need any food. I went back to the house and this lady, she packed my lunch. She says, I\u2019m a stranger in the city. I was afraid to venture too far out. She says well you can go to the zoo. The zoo was nearby. I could walk over there, Adams-Morgan. She gave me the lunch so she says it\u2019s a big zoo. Big zoo, I\u2019m afraid I might be lost in the zoo. So the first bench I approached I sat down and I ate my lunch up. I finished for the day. The next day I ventured out and I went to 14\" Street. That time 14\" Street was all white and you could walk. It wasn\u2019t like after before the riots. I looked in different stores. I saw a cleaning store and I see somebody reading a Jewish newspaper, I recognized it. I says maybe should go inside and ask him if he can find me a job. But I hesitated, I didn\u2019t go in. The following day, don\u2019t forget, I still had food, I went downtown. I think Lafayette Park or some place. I just sat down and men were sitting there. I struck up a conversation with him. He asked me where I\u2019m from and everything. I told him where I come from. He says he\u2019s an ex-Navy man. He was in the Seabees. He says he lives on 14\" Street with his wife. He lives in the Cavalier Apartments on 14\" Street. I was still living far away like I told you, near the zoo which is all in walking distance. He says why don\u2019t you come and I want my wife to meet you. Okay, so maybe the next day, I went and met his wife. He says you know we have to find you a room where you can stay. I told him I don\u2019t like where I stay. We could find you a job. I think he gave me dinner and he said would you like to -- so he says we find a job first. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be able to find a room. How you going to pay? He asked me what I did. I says I don\u2019t know. I worked for the American army, he kitchens. They going to find you a job in People\u2019s Drug Store. In the commissary at night. Are you familiar with Washington? They had counters with food and all this stuff. He took me to the Personnel and they find a job. So I work at night. He says well, we got to get youa room. I didn\u2019t like my job. I didn\u2019t like ay nights sleeping in the daytime, work at night. I cannot meet nobody. I was working there maybe for a week or for two weeks. Then he says now we go into the People\u2019s Drug Stores, 14\" and Park Road was a drug store and they have notices, who rents for rooms. Inside of a day, he saw a room for rent right around the corner where he lives. We went over there and we talked to the man. They were refugees too. They were German Jewish refugees but they arrived there before the war. But they were still refugees. He recognized my accent. Where you from, from Poland? I told him. He says where do you work? I says I just got a job at People\u2019s overnight. I don\u2019t like this job and the work at night. He says you know what, he says. I got a cousin; he\u2019s got a restaurant. Let me call up; if he needs somebody. He calls him up and this cousin live around the neighborhood. He was living Arkansas Avenue, in walking distance too. He says I have a young man, he\u2019s from Poland, he works at night. Do you think you can use him? He says bring him over. He says, you work the same evening. We walk over the same evening come over, how you doing, like with wine. All right, a little bit of wine, Manischievez. He says I have a place downtown near Thomas Circle. He says come over there. If you like it, you take the job. If you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s fine too. The next day I go over there. It\u2019s a daytime job. He says, so you spend a day, what do you have to lose. You\u2019re off in the daytime, you work at night. I stayed there and I says I like it. He paid me a dollar an hour, 40- hour week. I took home $36 but I figured I have a room already. I paid $40 for my room, nice people, German people, nice and clean. I have aroom, I\u2019m single so I don\u2019t have to go out for food. I have a daytime job.

I heard different stories that the people who came back from the camp, who came back to the hometowns, and the Poles made sarcastic remark. So many of you still survive! I thought you all dead and things like that. Then as things became known, when they liquidated the ghetto, the most of them went to Kelna and then they went to Auschwitz. Then I considered, I looked at the picture, my father was already 40 years old. He was born in 1900. He was 44 years, it\u2019s not old but the Germans done that and you don\u2019t have much food to eat, you look like an old man. My mother, one year younger. Then I had a younger brother.

They tried to help but I didn\u2019t get any response.

I wouldn\u2019t condemn the whole race or the whole nation but a lot of people could\u2019ve survived. The populations was very hostile in Europe, in Eastern Europe especially. In Western Europe it was a different story but in Eastern Europe, the Jews were always second-class citizens. Even right now, I\u2019m reading the stories like after cleaning of the Warsaw ghetto, they brought the people from Auschwitz to clean the Warsaw ghetto. When the Poles made a revolt, they freed some of the inmates. The revolt didn\u2019t last long but just for six weeks or so. They freed some of the inmates, they cleaning the Warsaw ghetto. They said we want to free Poland with our Jews. Some of them got killed after the war so that what it is. That\u2019s man inhumanity to man. Right now if you see something wrong, you stand up and get to be counted. That\u2019s exactly what it means -- man\u2019s inhumanity to man. It\u2019s an old poem, I don\u2019t know if you read. It\u2019s not a poem, it was in the paper. A German priest writes. He says when Hitler came into power in 1933, he said, they start persecuting the Jews. He says, I wasn\u2019t a Jew, I didn\u2019t spoke up. Then they take the homosexuals put them in concentration camp -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with it -- I wasn\u2019t a homosexual, I didn\u2019t speak up. Then they took the clergy, the Protestants, I wasn\u2019t a Protestant, I didn\u2019t spoke up. It came to the Catholic, I wasn\u2019t a Catholic, I didn\u2019t spoke up. It came to me, there was nobody else to speak up for me. That\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s what it is."
