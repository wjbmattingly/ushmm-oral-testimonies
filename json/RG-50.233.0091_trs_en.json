He worked 1n a finishing factory. They brought it back to the factory and they dyed the material and they took out all this floss and they prepared it for the stores -- to be ready to go to the stores and to work. Here you go in, you buy a ready-made suit. But in Europe ,especially 50 years ago, you went to a store first and you bought the material. Then you had to look for a tailor. So when they finished the material, the material went to the stores. The people went in and said I need material for a suit. Man rolled it open, says, how much do you need? He brought the measurements to the tailor. The tailor told him how much he\u2019s going to need. He took the scissors, he cut it off, he took it to the tailor and he made the suit."

They always felt like second -class citizens. In this country we refer like \u2018we\u2019. In Poland you refer \u2018they\u2019. You felt like an outsider, like you were not part of the process and things like that. So it\u2019s different. They had a quota, they had a quota in school, they had a quota in the military. A Jew couldn\u2019t be a high official in the government. Maybe from the Jewish district, he was elected, a representative, but that\u2019s about--he couldn\u2019t be a high official, appointed. He couldn\u2019t--they didn\u2019t take any Jews."

            "answer": "Okay, I remember exactly when the war broke out, September 1, 1939. I remember it was a Friday. I think my mother went to the market. Friday was market day, especially with the Jewish people. They went to buy the stuff for the Sabbath. There wasn\u2019t like a grocery store. You went to open market and you came back in the morning. It was eight, nine o\u2019clock; the weather was crisp; everybody was talking about the war. I looked up the sky and I saw these planes with the top that time because the war hysteria was going already a week or two weeks before mobilization, talk about the Germans and things like this. On Friday, nothing happened to our city. The planes flew over in the morning. They were just like birds up in the sky, the sun was shining. Saturday, the planes came back again and the Poles were shooting up. You could see the tracer bullets, you don\u2019t know if you hit them or not. The planes flew right over, flew higher, nothing reached them. But Sunday, they flew very low. They came very low over the city and you could even see the pilot inside, very, very low. The city was in a panic. Everybody was going towards Warsaw. The Poles appealed to the populations, to able- bodied men, to go toward Warsaw. We\u2019re going make a defense line over there, a stand. My father left too. I remember we marched all night, 54 left Zgierz, we left for the city. We went to a nearby village. I don\u2019t remember how many miles, maybe ten miles, 15 was a village. Everybody was just like -- refugees. We took a few possessions, a little bit of bread. At night, we got very scared because the Poles opened all the prisons and they let out all the inmates. I don\u2019t know if they were political inmates or criminal inmates but you see a lot of people, they look like hoodlums with shaved heads. That night, my father left. He went toward Warsaw."

            "question": "So all of you left together to go to the next town?",
            "answer": "To the next village. We went there overnight. But the next morning, my father left -- he was just -- toward Warsaw -- I don\u2019t know. Because the Poles --. At that time, everything was disorganized already. It didn\u2019t take long for the Poles to get disorganized already. It didn\u2019t take long for the Poles to get disorganized. They didn\u2019t send you a summons, you have to report. They just broadcast, by word of mouth that all able bodied men who had served in the Polish army at one time or another had to report towards Warsaw. They named the city Lovitz or something, we\u2019re going to make there a defense. Me and my brother and my mother were left alone. We figured well, we cannot defend ourselves. We have no clothes, nothing; we just left in a hurry. We went back towards Zgierz, our city. On the way, we encountered the Polish army coming back, disorganized, disheveled with horses with wagons, some on foot. I didn\u2019t see any mechanized unit, none whatsoever. We came back to our home and the neighbors said they were glad to see us back, even though they were Poles. They gave us milk and bread and things like that. I wasn\u2019t there maybe one hour or two, I heard shooting. My neighbor who was a man, he didn\u2019t run away because he owned a farm nearby. He said the Germans are coming. He probably got wind of it before. We were into like a shelter. I don\u2019t know if it was a shelter or maybe an empty cellar, I don\u2019t know. We were there for a few hours, we heard shooting, then we came out and the Germans were here. The next morning, we went outside and we saw strange uniforms, not like the Polish army. We saw a lot of looting, knocking off the stores, everything was in disarray. We see whole columns of Germans going towards Warsaw. They were passing our town because Warsaw was north of where we were living"

Now I\u2019m reading the stories where the Germans came into Lodz and I see January 6. Being we were just about four kilometers four or five away from Lodz, this was about six days or so.

He went back to the factory. The factory was not in operation. They put a German commissar in the factory because it was a Jewish enterprise, was owned by Jews but only Poles were working except my father and my grandfather. They were the only two people working in the factory. He was there maybe for a week or so."

They were just straightening materials out and things like this. No payroll, nothing. He just wanted to hold on to it because there was nothing else to do. He went back to the factory. I don\u2019t think he even got paid for it. They had a German commissar and the German commissar moved; he was a local German, he moved into the quarters where the former people who worked in the office used to live. They kicked them out. After a week or so, they dismissed him because he was a Jew. He wasn\u2019t allowed to work. Then one day, I don\u2019t have a perception of time, maybe it was three weeks or four weeks, according to the book that I read now, it didn\u2019t take long, maybe mostly five, six weeks, they said all the Jews have to report to the market square."

Anyway, somebody came out and made an announcement, talking about the Germans if I say somebody. They gave us three days to leave the city. A lot of people were living up north towards Warsaw, a lot of people -- we left for Lodz to live, for L-o-d-z because my mother had a sister that was there."

The Germans came in in September and maybe we left 1n October, November, I don\u2019t remember. Wasn\u2019t even snow on the ground yet because we rented a horse and buggy. It was only about 10, 11 kilometers away. We piled up our few possessions, we took our furniture, we took it into our neighbors, to the gentiles because we figure if the war is going to be over -- everybody was talking about England and France going to join the war, the war\u2019s not going to last long."

We took it in for safekeeping. We knew there\u2019s going to be a ghetto. We moved in with my aunt, with a few possessions. We were there maybe a week or two weeks but my father was working with somebody -- he was in the office. When I mentioned it that there were two Jews working in the factory, I was talking about two Jews like working people. But in the office, there were a few more Jewish people working over there. One of the Jews, he was really from Lodz, he worked at Zgierz and he was commuting because he came with the tramway every morning. We find out that he has a lot of-- he knew a lot of people, he\u2019s got a lot of pull. My father went to him and asked him if he can help us out; we need some quarters where to live. He sure did. We got that room because apartments were very scarce. They put in the Jews from the city of Lodz itself, from all the environs. They put them in a small section and it was the worst section, the most dilapidated section in the city. They assigned us a Jewish quarter. We had one room, just one room. It served as a kitchen and everything, just one room for four people. Then -- that was in -- yeah, also for the refugees who came from the environs, they opened public kitchens. This was all in the fall of 1939. I even remember the next Passover which was the next spring like April now, was still the public kitchens, we eat in the public kitchens because we were refugees. Then they close the ghetto. May 1\u201c they close the Lodz ghetto."

Like I mentioned, this guy, he worked before, he helped us with the apartment, he also became head of one of the hospitals. They had three hospitals -- first of all when they closed the ghetto, they had 160,000 Jews. That\u2019s a lot of people. The ghetto was composed of two sections. In other words, through the main street, the tramway was going. The tramway was going through the ghetto and they had a bridge. The Jews had to cross the bridge."

Let\u2019s say 25 people assembled, 50 people and there were no more traffic coming to the main street because there was barbed wire on both sides; they let the people through. I\u2019m going to give you, I have the book and a picture. I\u2019m going to give you a clear picture of what this thing looked like. I had to go on the other side.

They still got-- you still couldn\u2019t go out. They were sentries posted shoot to kill; there was barbed wire around day and night and nobody could get in. One section of the ghetto, the cemetery was adjoining it. There was a lot of black market going on and you still could buy food but then times were getting bad. Then the Germans requested people for a settlement; it was getting crowded. They brought more people in from the surrounding vicinities from smaller towns. They were liquidating the ghetto and then they were coming into the Lodz ghetto. As soon as the ghetto got crowded, now I\u2019m reading the books, I know how it was. At that time they were opening the camp in Kaldum, Humhof, the extermination camp. They had to feed the camp, the factories. Ostensibly, they were taking -- they were taking some people out for work too, on road crews, healthy men. But they were also taking out people who were sick. They sent to different camps."

If I didn\u2019t want to cross to the bridge, I could wait near the gate. Like I mentioned, when no traffic, after 25, 30 people assembled and people assembled other side; there are two guards. The German guards now, they open the gates and you were let through, pedestrian traffic basically. But I think they only had about two or three bridges for crossing, I\u2019m going to show you the picture later on. I gave a map of the ghetto too."

This is why all the concentration camps -- I should correct myself -- the extermination camps were in Polish and the Slavic soil like in the Ukraine, in Russia and Poland. Because the local population was hostile and they couldn\u2019t do it. They couldn\u2019t do this in France and Belgium or Holland because enough of the population would help us, or at least there would be an outcry about it and things like that"

Like I said, the ghetto was self- administered. They had more or less autonomy. From the beginning, the Germans didn\u2019t mix in, they just outside. They figured why should a German mix in if the Jews themselves can do the job for them? I seen a lot of boys. They were like mailmen.

At that time, everything was nice and dandy. We had a post office, we had packages, everything was functioning normally, like this. The Germans, at that time, in 1940, beginning of \u201941, they didn\u2019t quite decide to exterminate the Jews yet. They put them in ghettos, they concentrate them in centers but I think the Wannsee started a little bit later on, in 1942. So that time we still received packages and mail and Jews came from Prague, from Germany. They had relatives; there were mixed marriages and mixed partners maybe who didn\u2019t come to the ghetto and they sent packages. It was like a post office, everything was functioning normally, it wasn\u2019t quite bad. You still could get a lot of stuff on the black market, like food and things like that."

They had nothing in common with the eastern Jews, with the locals and was wintertime. There was no heating, no fuels, when you came to the houses, you knock on the door, like you had something, a summons for them to report for a settlement or something, you had to go they were all laying in the beds -- were hunger -- they were dying with hunger, very bad.

They came in with horses and buggies with Polish drivers. Then the Jewish drivers took over. They took it into the ghetto. They unload the material and they brought the wagon with the horses back. While they were going from the enclave out to the distribution corners to take it, they had, they were guarded with Jewish police. They just had armbands, they didn\u2019t have any guns. They were standing on the planks or going behind the wagon if a potato fell off, they picked it up and put it back in the wagon and things like that. Potatoes came in and flour came in and beets came and flour came. Don\u2019t forget, after all they had 160,000 Jews. The Jews baked their own bread but to work in the bakery was a privilege.

Also I want to mention that near the cemetery is a section called Marishna near the ghetto, there was a sidetrack, a railroad track. They took them all to the settlements, went to this station."

This way they always emptied it, always empty it. From the beginning, it was up to the local administration who should go. Because the Germans really didn\u2019t care. They said we need 7,000 people for the settlement, we need 900,000, 50 hundred people so if some people came from Germany,, from Austria and they were strangers; they were not even resettled yet, they were just living in a building, they just took them.

Instead of water, gas comes out. Somebody must have escaped, don\u2019t forget I was very young then and your mind didn\u2019t believe.

            "answer": "They told them they would settle in the east. The ghetto, like I said, was quite a large area and they had like a central prison, the Jews. The people had assembled there, like I said, but some people, they really went for work outside the ghetto. Because they had to go to a commission; they had German doctors and they really needed them to work. But if they took everybody, whole families, you know they didn\u2019t take these people to work. They just said you have to be resettled in the east. Like I said, I was hiding; then one day after maybe a week\u2019s time or so, I had to report. So I was there for three, four days in the central prison. I remember my father came the last days towards the barbed wire. I remember the picture just like vividly. I remember what he looked like. In Europe he was wearing boots and I remember his face like -- . So we march, the next morning we march to the train station, we marched, all young people, no adult with us. Youngsters, I was there maybe sixteen, seventeen already. They put us in an open cart, put us in one of the good wagons, cattle cars and they closed up. We were riding for two, three hours. All of a sudden, they open the door. There was a truck waiting there and the Germans waiting there. I don\u2019t remember how many people, maybe 50 people from our wagon, whatever it was. Maybe 50, maybe 60, I didn\u2019t count them; they took us to a labor camp. It was in Kielce. It was in southern Poland. It\u2019s spelled K-1-e-l-c-e. I don\u2019t know if you heard of it before. They took us over there and we asked how -- I seen them loading up our clothes, our baggage. We had on the truck and then -- they had already a labor camp. That camp still had Jews already from the surrounding vicinities. The camp was adjoining a factory. The factory was called Hasac. It was a Polish munitions factory before the war or maybe it was just a metal factory, I don\u2019t know. The Germans converted this to a munitions factory. Over there, in comparison to the ghetto, was good because I had plenty food, as much as I want. The only this, you came in contact with the Poles. You work in the factory besides with the Poles. So we went to the barracks after finish the work but they went to their homes. They promised us that they going to give us the clothes, I seen them loading the truck. We ask them, where is the clothes, we never got the clothes. I only had what I had on me."

            "question": "The clothes that you\u2019re talking about were clothes that you had brought with you and they made you give up when you got there?",
            "answer": "Yeah, I didn\u2019t have -- that\u2019s right. I seen them loading the truck but when I got to the camp, I never see anything. I had an extra sweater, maybe an extra pants, an extra pair shoes. We were all probably gone for labor work so everybody took a little bit clothes. They never gave it to us. This was good clothes because we took nothing but the best. I could barter this if I had it. I remember I just had one sweater, some I give it away and the Pole, the next day, brought me a loaf of bread or something like that. But food was relatively good because the locals, they were locals in the adjoining cities and they probably came with all the clothes. They were bartering all the time so they didn\u2019t eat in the commune kitchen. Was always a lot of food. Then at night, I could go to the Polish kitchen if they had food left over, they gave us if I worked the night shift. In comparison to the ghetto, as far as food was concerned, was gold. I was always worried about what happened to my parents, everything seemed unreal. I got up in the morning, everything strange. I worked in the factory; I was making bullets. We put in steel and the machines, if you\u2019re working steel with the machines, had to have oil, constant to the oil. Like I said, I don\u2019t have any clothes to exchange nothing so got all over me and I developed all blisters. I had all blisters on my knee, on my feet. Because I had no apron, just plain clothes and I had nothing to change. Don\u2019t forget I mentioned that I had left in March, 1944 but then the weather was getting colder. I went out in the morning to work. They marched us from the assembling, we had to march to factory. We didn\u2019t have to march too far, just like from here to the light because the camp was attached to the factory. But a cold day, it hit my flesh and it was hurting because I had blisters. When I was in that labor camp in Kielce, I heard about the invasion, the Normandy invasion in June 6. I heard that. But that time, I really didn\u2019t know where Normandy was; I just heard that the Americans and the British was there, I don\u2019t have any perception of time; maybe the camp, maybe two, three months. It was the summer and then one morning, this camp, we were guarded by the Ukrainians. A Ukrainian auxiliary this camp. You mentioned if somebody escaped from the ghetto and I told you I didn\u2019t know of anybody. But from the camp, I did heard that they escaped, from the labor camp. But they caught him and then they brought him back and then they shot him. It was a different part of the country, they did escape and they brought him back. This was still in the summertime, after the Normandy invasion. It was in June, maybe July or maybe August, one morning they lined us all up and they say they have to evacuate because the Russian made the offensive. They were coming westward so they evacuated us and they put us in open flatcars. We were riding maybe a day or two and then they let us out in an open field. They gave us food; the Germans were debating where they should take us. They didn\u2019t know what to do with us -- all the people from the labor camp. Was not a big camp, maybe six, seven hundred people. As I mentioned before, only about 50, 60 people. They had the whole wagons left over but they dropped them off in different camps. This camp only attached this car, maybe away to another couple cities, attached like a camp. They didn\u2019t know where to take us, we said why can\u2019t we go back -- we still in Poland -- we said why can\u2019t you take us back to the Lodz ghetto? There\u2019s a lot of Jews over there. One of the guys told us, the Lodz ghetto is being evacuated, dismantled now. Right now, we in the field, 1t was still warm, must have been in August. Now according to the books that I read, that was when the ghetto was being liquidated, in July and August. After a couple of days, we decided and they took us to a place, Shedbush. We still in Poland, I find it on the map, wasn\u2019t far away, maybe 25 miles away. Anyway it was all youngsters and we were digging ditches, anti-tank ditches. The organization Todd was in charge, T-o-double-d. It was named after a German, it was a labor battalion or something like that. We came, in the morning, in the daytime we went to dig the ditches and at night we were sleeping in barns, in farmers\u2019 barns. But at night, we heard shooting. In the morning we got up and we ask the German what is all the shooting? We heard the partisans, they were attacking the German units or something like this in the countryside. So after we dig the ditches, I don\u2019t know, maybe for a week or so, they took us away to Chintzerhau . The Chintz 1S a -- | think it\u2019s near Upper Silesia -- it\u2019s a very well known Polish city. The Polish Madonna -- Chintz is on the Polish-German border not far away in Upper Silesia. The same factory with the same work that I did in Kielce that I did in Chintz . Over there, I met my friend. I met my friend which I still keep up to now; he is in New York."

Somehow my memory fades but he\u2019s got a very good recollection and I met him. I remember the day; he was wearing boots. Over there maybe you worked about maybe for a month or two, was all , 1944, remember. We went in the morning --. He wasn\u2019t in Kielce with Gara; he was in a different camp. He was in Scarzilsco. By then, when the Germans came, they evacuated everybody and every able- bodied men they put in --. He came in Chintz and I met him. We were working in the same factory. I don\u2019t know if we worked there for a month or six weeks. Anyway, it was still the same year; the Germans came one morning, rounded us up and marched us to the train station. They put us on cattle cars and I could see that the local population, they were running. We heard distant shooting. I don\u2019t know, rumors spread in our ranks that the Russians are entering the city on the other side but it wasn\u2019t true yet. I could see the Germans were loading the big guns on the trains, the German army. Anyway they put us on cattle cars. We were gone for three or four days and we wind up in Germany. We find out that they took us \u2014 we went to Buchenwald in the concentration camp. Over there they opened up, we came to Buchenwald and everybody was eating up whatever they had in the food packages with them. They were discarding the Polish money and the German Reich marks. After two, three hours, we went to sit in barracks. They had -- Buchenwald was a big camp, was about 60,000 inmates at that time. It was established early in 1933. Right now, I know it was a political camp. In Buchenwald heather on the ground. But that time I didn\u2019t realize, I didn\u2019t realize that. Anyway we registered and all the inmates did all the work. They ask us where we come from, your mother\u2019s name, your father\u2019s name and all this stuff. After registration, we went to a big hall. We had to take all the clothes that we wear and before I left Poland, I mentioned that before I left the ghetto, my mother told me that you have an aunt in Paris which I did have, her sister. She says you have a cousin in Belgium and she gave me addressed envelopes and things like that and says maybe you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. Maybe you\u2019re going to need it one day. But when I went to Buchenwald and I had family pictures, my mother, my younger brother, I had to put everything on the table. All the clothes, everything on the table and I only remember one German. A black uniformed German came in, we all had to 0 to commission. He looked at my legs because like I said, from the dirty oil, I don\u2019t know what I blubbered up in German. He says, he just looked at me and was thinking, thinking. He just motioned at a line so I went over there. We had to go in first to a shower. I remember we just looking 1s water coming in or gas coming out. Water was coming out and then we had to all to go in. They had a big disinfection tube, was maybe like this room. Had to jump in, oh I had all scabs over here -- was burning and burning. Before this, I forgot, after I took all the clothes off and everything, we went to a different room. The inmates were all, the inmates had clippers. They clipping the head, clipping hair, clipping hair, all over there. Then we were all clipped up. We had to jump into this tub, this disinfect thing. Oh, it was burning something terrible. Then we jumped out. This was January, was already January. knows, January 18, according to the record, I got there, January 18. We went up from this tube, oh yeah, after we got up from the tube, I remember going up a flight of stairs. They gave me clothes. They gave me a pair boots, shoes, no socks. They gave me pants but no underwear. They gave me a jacket but no shirt. I didn\u2019t have the striped jacket, just because, don\u2019t forget, it was January and it was already chaos in all those camps. They had so many people come from Germany, I didn\u2019t even have a tattoo. I just had an assigned number. They gave me all these clothes. Then we went out to the other end of the barracks where we stand for two, three hours until we assigned a barrack. Here it\u2019s January, it\u2019s cold."

You had no blanket, they don\u2019t give you a blanket, we use straw. To be exact, they were looking like shelves, like bins. Like you see the pictures, you slide in and slide out. I was in this barracks and then later on -- when I was in the barracks, I met my friend. But first of all, they had kapos in the barracks. I didn\u2019t know what the word kapo means but I know people came to us and he says you people are newcomers? I says yes. I says who is your leader. We called, one was a Jewish policemen in the labor camp was this. They want to find out how we are treated .If we told him; we are treated by our own people, they kill him on the spot. Because they say we want to do an example, in case they take your people out for labor for a day or two to the city and somebody is going to inform on you, your own people; when he comes back, he\u2019s going to have the same thing. He says we\u2019re organizing the thing. I remember one guy, he was the head of the camp. He came to us and says, don\u2019t say anything bad. Because we always thought maybe we came from the ghetto from Lodz, they didn\u2019t give us our clothes, we could have lived better. Buy different food, but I don\u2019t know what happened to him. Maybe somebody else squealed on him, maybe not, I don\u2019t know. I was in that camp and then I met my friend, it was nice. The first day, when I assigned my rations, I put it in my pocket. I figure I\u2019m going to eat it later on. You get one day of rations, a piece of bread and a bowl of soup so I figure I\u2019m going to eat the bread at night. So at night, I went to eat, the bread was gone. Somebody slipped it out and I didn\u2019t feel it. I figured out, don\u2019t ask me know but I don\u2019t know. I remember one thing, I sewed up my pockets. Don\u2019t ask me where I got the needle and where I got the thread. Somebody must have had it. I punched a hole in the jacket through here and I was slitting out to here. While I was in this barrack, they took out people for work, the kapos. They had people in the barracks, they had people -- Germans, they had Russians who preceded us to Buchenwald. Some people who came maybe in 1939, in 1940, in 1938, they were in charge of the barracks, they were in charge. The kapos, they had to go to a special appellplatz, the main camp where they counted them. We had to go to a different spot too. Sometimes, we stayed for two, three hours in the snow, don\u2019t forget it was January. The snowflakes they were falling; he counted us up, then dismissed. Then dismisses, you went into a cold barrack. If you had a piece of bread left over in the morning, you ate it. If not, nothing. In daytime, in the morning, we heard a whistle blowing. They took us for work, from the barracks, just to drag wood because you have to remember that Buchenwald was carved out from a forest. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar or not. It\u2019s ten miles away from Weimar. It\u2019s a lot of birch trees and forest. Maybe they need the wood, maybe they didn\u2019t need it. They just make you work. They don\u2019t let you just stay around idle. They were taking us out for work every day."

Who knows what it was, I don\u2019t remember. Anyway after you went through this gauntlet, they lined us up and it was already dusk like I said and we marched to Weimar. The Germans marched us to Weimar. I remember they had big dogs on the sides, big German shepherds. They came to the train station, I think it was really dark. They put us in open flatcars, was already dark, maybe ten, eleven o\u2019clock at night. I don\u2019t have any perception of time. The trains start moving. So the trains start moving; we moved overnight and then in the daytime, planes came and shot up, Q\u201d They shot up at the train\u201d. ",

Then the planes came and shot up again. So they assembled us all in columns I don\u2019t know, maybe 5,000 people. Don\u2019t forget they say they empty Buchenwald, not all of them. They marched us to Flossenburg. This is another camp. I don\u2019t know how you spell Flossenburg, it\u2019s near Weiden. Right now I\u2019m reading all the books. I\u2019m interested because I lived this period; I know that right now from history was a criminal camp. One of the German, Admiral Kanaris, he was head of the German Upfeur, German intelligence. He got hung up over there. In the middle of the story or not. Over there, was even worse than Buchenwald because we were sleeping --. I was with my friend there from New York and we sleeping that camp maybe for a week or so. Then they say they evacuated Flossenburg. Thy marched us out from Flossenburg to the train. That was in the morning, maybe eleven o\u2019clock. I think it was on a Sunday, I don\u2019t know why I remember Sunday but I have stuck in my head, Sunday. I know the sun was shining high and the train station was right outside of the camp and they loading us in open boxcars, listen to that. The trains didn\u2019t even start moving yet. All of a sudden, I see planes from far away. Big planes in the sky and the sun shines on them, I think that was the jet age coming out. In a second, they were right over the train -- shot everything up. All of a sudden, I heard something hit my face. I asked my friend, do I have blood on my face? He just looked, he says no. But I looked up and I see that we were not moving yet. They had a big sign, crossing written down in German, made out of wood. A crossing sign, you know, maybe one of the splinters, some bullet too, hit me in the face. But nothing was bleeding, it was nothing, something hit me. When the planes shot up the train, everybody jumped off the train so I jumped off the train too. The Germans were running to the farmhouses, to the nearby houses. I run after them too. I heard them, run into German, must have been a German house or something, I wasn\u2019t the only one, maybe there were dozens of legs, we run with the guards."

We were riding again, maybe for a day or two. Planes used to come, the Americans and British were already nearby. They didn\u2019t have far to go. They were already in France. They shooting at the planes. The guard says, some of them just flew over and they didn\u2019t come down low so the guard says over there they\u2019re your friends. If they come over, you wave to them, so we waved, we had no choice, we waved. Some just flew over, they didn\u2019t do anything. Sometimes they came down low.

As soon as they heard the air drone or something like this, the locomotive detached itself and it went for the nearest tunnel. After the ride was over, if the locomotive was intact, 1t wasn\u2019t shot up, they could use it. It came back and they pull off again. But if the locomotive didn\u2019t have time, they had to get something else. But anyway, they shot up a locomotive the last time and they couldn\u2019t get anybody so a big fat German says, everybody line up. Whoever cannot -- we going to march from now on. Whoever cannot march doesn\u2019t have to worry, we going to provide transportation. I know what transportation means. I was the first in line. Now I can see how lucky I am because, don\u2019t forget, I was in this labor camp, like I mentioned before the food was relatively good. I could barter, the locals, so 1t was more food left for me. I was in the kitchen at night and it was food and the camp was only for about three months so I was in relative good health. I was in the first line over there. We marched all night, me and my friend from New York. Then at night, we wind up near the roadside and we took a little bit leaves and they says you\u2019re going to spend the night over there. The next night the same thing. But the third night, was raining bad. I got soaked all through, all wet. Whoever fell out of line, if you read the story about Bataan or Corregidor, the same thing. I was ready, my friend was ready, I was ready to go the roadside but my friend who lives in New York, he says, come on."

I was ready to give up; he says, he grabs me he says you got to keep ---. So towards -- that was at night. We were marching all night, all wet, you couldn\u2019t walk, soaked through. Towards morning, it was already daybreak, we stopped on a farm and they put us in barns. They says you\u2019re going to rest here, the guards. All of a sudden, decide to take us all out for punishment because somehow, somebody, they were messing up the barns. There were no toilets there. They were lining everybody up. They going to take us to a march or maybe, who knows. The Germans had a tendency. If somebody did any infractions, they lined everybody up and they picked people at random. They lined them up and they says I\u2019m going to pick every third man, or every tenth man. They just pull them out and they just shot them just for no reason at all. So maybe they tried to do the same thing this time. When they were getting ready, everybody lined up, we heard shooting. So the German says everybody back inside the barn. Then the shooting intensified. Like I mentioned, it\u2019s a barn. A barn has slits so some of the inmates looked --. Before I mention that, for some reason an egg fell down, a chicken egg fell down and my friend was nearby. We took the egg and we split it in half, a fresh egg. While we were sitting in the barn, like I mentioned before, it was raining all night and the barn is warm near the hay and the straw, our clothes is steaming. We heard the shooting and we looked out. Some of the inmates says, the Russians are here. They saw the stars. At that time, we didn\u2019t know the American tanks have stars too. We know the Russians have stars. Then we notice in the front of the barn the guards taking white handkerchiefs, or white rags or whatever it was white and put on the front of their rifles. You know what I am talking about?"

Don\u2019t forget they evacuated the camp like Buchenwald in the thousands. The Germans had the transport too with them. They had the carts and the horses and some motor transports. All of a sudden you see the inmates they robbing the wagons and all the stuff. I went to a wagon too, seeing some German boots. I had no shoes, I put on a pair of boots. I had no size, just pulled them on. Like I mentioned before, don\u2019t forget, I said I sewed up the pockets. I go over there and I see a big German woman. She has a big country bread all around. She cut slices and here the inmates stay and everybody gets a big slice of bread. Take a big, line the lines, she gives me a slice of bread too. Then I go to the next house and I see raw potatoes outside. I take these raw potatoes and I start packing them inside. I\u2019m all weighed down, heavy.

We said, well we from Poland. We find a Polish-American. He speaks in broken Polish. He goes to the truck and brings the care rations up. Now I know they care rations, the cheese and the candy was there. Somebody gets us cigarettes and I start to smoke. I\u2019m all dizzy. So I go to the next village. The village not far away, maybe three miles. Don\u2019t forget there are thousands of people in the villages. I see a German stays outside. I says food, essen. He says, yah, yah, come inside. I thought I\u2019m going to be the only one. I think I went with somebody too. Somebody was besides me there. I go in and the place is full.

Okay so I was in that home and I didn\u2019t have much clothes. Some of them, like I said, some of the ex-inmates were smarter and wiser than I am, some of them went to German homes and who was an ex-Nazi. They says, listen, you were a Nazi or you were the buegermeister, give me some clothes, give me that. So they came with clothes, with sweaters and jackets. I was young, I was 17, 18, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do. I want to go back to Poland. Don\u2019t forget, this happened in April and I left home in March, the ghetto, about a year I think since I left home. I still was homesick, I was thinking about Poland and my brother and my sister. At that time, don\u2019t forget the first week, we didn\u2019t know the extent, what happened with Auschwitz and all the sick, Kelman and all this concentration camp. I still wanted to go back to Poland. I was in this home. All of a sudden, American soldiers came, one or two, I don\u2019t remember. He was a Jewish American soldier. He says we are in tents here on the outskirts of the city in Scheondorf. We are in camp, we need about three, four volunteers who wants to go to work. Like washing pots and pans in the kitchen. I says, I volunteer to go. I went and another couple boys and maybe two, three boys. We had a ball, all the oranges we want to eat and had a couple of -- I had an Italian cook, an American cook, Italian. from Chicago, a few Polish words and he made spaghetti and it was good. Oh the spaghetti, anything, I didn\u2019t mind to wash the pots and pans. All of a sudden, chewing gum and candy; they were living in tents on the outskirts of the city. In the evening, they brought us back to that house where we sleeping over there. The next morning, he said would you like to come back tomorrow, I says yes.

Then they said, all of a sudden, they had to leave too, after two, three months. By that time, I was working over there, I also find out that the size of this was Nuremsbek. There 1s a sizeable Jewish community in Furt. Furt, it\u2019s Bavaria too. It\u2019s spelled F-u-r-t. We took the streetcar from Nuremberg and you went to Furt. They had Jewish community there and they were all newcomers and had a home too. Just like a house but I was not living in this house. I think we all had a tent to ourselves, was handy there. At that time came to go too. So they said they\u2019re going back to the United States but before they say, they pack for their vacation. They going to leave from Marseilles, France. So they had two choices. We can either leave you in Germany and find you another job with the American army or we can give you back to France. At that time France was right after post-war in \u201945, they could bring across the border. You know in \u00b045, is everything chaos still. He says -- we figure, well if they going to dump us off in France, we\u2019re on our own, don\u2019t know anybody. Here I find up, the community of Furt and things like that. I felt already a little bond. So he says why don\u2019t you find us a job here? Next to the where they had the tents, was the American hospital. I have letters from the hospital. They give letters of recommendation, 381*' Evacuation Hospital or something like this. We decide to work over there and they give us quarters and they give us food. Like I said, we had all the clothes, we had a room. Inside, was no tents, already in the hospital, had separate rooms, three, four boys. In the morning, we just went to work in the kitchen. We were not cooking; they had army cooks. You know what we were in charge? We were lighting the stoves. You remember the field army stoves, are you familiar with that?"

I think later on and I got paid for that too --but it\u2019s so long ago. I think later on they transfer because they had German civilians working too. We went in the German economy. Then, like I said, my friend, the one I spend the war with, he found himself a job too. He found himself a job in the adjoining city with the American army too. He told me he heard -- heard a lot of the people who are liberated, they go to America. They have relatives but I didn\u2019t have anybody so nothing to claim. Then he told me that if you go to Munich, Congress passed a law, he told me the American government -- I didn\u2019t know the difference between Congress and no Congress that some displaced person they can register with the Joint. He went first and he came back, he says yes, you can register. I went there too and I registered and I had a very easy time because after the war I worked. I had recommendations from the army, had a good police record. Then I registered and I was -- oh yes, then I think that I went to be on my own. I still worked for the hospital, I worked for a while but I didn\u2019t want to live over there. Because in the evening I want to be free. I want to be with my own people and I put an ad in the paper. I\u2019m looking for a room. Rooms are very hard to get in Germany after the war. But I mentioned, I want to mention that a lot of German Jews came back, German Jews after the war. They were liberated or some maybe were never in a camp; they were mixed marriages and maybe the Germans didn\u2019t touch them. Anyway I went once to a service in Nuremberg, Jewish service. There were a lot of German Jews there who came back from Theresienstadt and things like that. I find out that they had very high positions in the post-war government in Germany right after the war. I want to live on my own. I talked to them and one told me he works in this ministry, the other in the other ministry. So I put an ad in the paper, I want to be on my own for a room. I got a response like in a post office box. I went to look at the room and the room was right near the Palace of Justice, near the military tribunal, where they tried the Nazis. As a matter of fact, the building was right across the street, I seen the Soviets on the balcony. They were living there too. The people who were attached to the Justice, to the Russian delegation. Anyway I looked at the room and the lady asked me what I do. I told her I am working at the hospital. She says yeah? I says I\u2019m Jewish. She says oh, yeah. After the war, everybody had a Jewish relative. She says you know what, I registered this room, she says, with the government because I don\u2019t want them to assign me a newcomer from -- an ethnic German from the displaced, from Schlis _ or something like this. If you can get it, if somehow you can bring a certificate that you want the room. I made contact with this German ministry. I tell him, listen I have a room but I need assignment. No problem, he gave me an assignment, I was living over there. Then my papers came through. They call me to the council. I had to give the birth certificate. I don\u2019t have a birth certificate, if you come from Europe, everything was taken away. That was relatively easy, you find people from your hometown. They know I\u2019m from Poland so I had this witnesses where I was born, where I\u2019m from and I assembled different papers. We get them translated into English. I went for the interview.

They say, the booklet is from -- it say Washington, D.C. is the seat of the government and New York is a big city and things like that. So I read all about it. I came on the ship . It took us eight days. I didn\u2019t get sick on the boat, a lot of people sick around me. The boat came to New York harbor like in the evening. All of a sudden when you come from Europe, from post-war Europe and we were outside in the harbor, we didn\u2019t go into New York harbor. We just stayed there overnight but you could see the cars moving, they looked like, it\u2019s a sight when you come from Europe and you don\u2019t see all the streets and the lights and fire way over --. Everything is alive, you see New York City. Especially when you see from far away. Maybe it was five miles away, out to the harbor. We stayed overnight on the boat.

We couldn\u2019t sleep already all night, passed the Statue of Liberty. I read of the Statue of Liberty in the book so I knew the Statue of Liberty. We passed it and the boat anchored. Then immigration came on the board. We had papers and everything. I became legitimate. We didn\u2019t go to Ellis Island. They put a pin on my lapel. I came through the Joint distribution. Somebody sponsored me but I don\u2019t know who did. It came tShe group but somebody must have did it. They had different nationalities.

He still had to go through customs. Now I know they\u2019re customs, they open up and they\u2019re looking. They assign you right there. You go on the other side and you get doughnuts and coffee. Doughnuts and coffee and then I saw a Yiddish-speaking woman comes to me. Remember that I had nothing to carry. I didn\u2019t need a porter. She says you come with me. I remember riding escalators. It must have been Penn Station or something, I don\u2019t know. I remember going to taxi, another taxi, maybe it was. I remember riding escalators and taking with the gate. There were a lot of people outside the gate0. She says, she gives me two tickets and she says, you going to Washington D.C. When the gate opens up, there will be a train there. When the people go down, she didn\u2019t even wait until the gate opens up, when the people go down, you go down the stairs and you get on the train with the other people and you get off in Washington D.C."

            "answer": "Well, I tell you. Right now, I cannot think of any reason because I put in my papers that I worked in the American army in the kitchen. Maybe they figured there\u2019s a lot of hotels in Washington, D.C., maybe he can find a job in a -- I don\u2019t know. They sent me to Washington, D.C.. They just send me there, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to Washington, D.C. and they gave me three dollars. She gave me three dollars, three American dollars and says, you buy lunch on the train. She says in Washington, D.C. you wear this pin and somebody is going to approach you. Okay, so the gate opens up and everybody goes down. The doors slide open and I go inside. Everyone sits down and I sit down too. Now I\u2019m ready \u2014 I says I got to go to Washington, D.C. They said how about I miss it, but I read Philadelphia in the book. They told you about the Liberty Bell \u2014 they have all these things written down in the book. All of a sudden I spot American Legionnaires and they had Washington, D.C. on Legionnaires\u2019 cups. So I thought to myself when they get off, I\u2019m going to get off too. I had doughnuts and I had the coffee and I had the three dollars in my pocket. I said I\u2019m not going to spend the three dollars to buy lunch because I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to get an American dollar next. I will not go in and have no . What I\u2019m going to do, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t spend the lunch and didn\u2019t buy anything. I\u2019m getting off in Washington, D.C.. Everybody 1s getting off the train. At that time the train wasn\u2019t yet the jet industry developed. The train was already a , 1f somebody traveled by train especially in 1949, Union Station was crowded. Everybody getting off, I\u2019m getting off. I\u2019m getting off waiting the main concourse, the main hall. I\u2019m just waiting there. I have the valise. I have my best clothes from Germany after the war. I have a suit on and lapel. The hall empties and nobody is approaching me. Nobody. I wait and wait. If you wait for somebody and you wait for ten minutes, it sounds like an hour especially when you\u2019re in a Strange country."

            "answer": "It\u2019s a travel-aid. They just do volunteer work for people who are stranded. It\u2019s not a regular travel agency where you pay money. I says maybe I should go in here and tell them that I\u2019m lost. I go by and I look in and I see a sailor sitting there talking to somebody so I hesitated. I says no I\u2019m going to wait another five minutes and the concourse is already empty. Then all of a sudden I see a couple or women. They coming towards me. They must have spot me the way I\u2019m dressed. They coming towards me and I had to see the boat. They had a car, they all volunteers. To me they probably wait. Maybe they couldn\u2019t find any volunteer, were late. We walk out Union Station and the first thing you see is the Capitol. I says this is the White House? No, they correct me, that is the Capitol. It never made any difference to me why is the Capitol so white. It all depends on which angle you look at the White House, at the portico, it looks like Capitol too. Anyway we got in their car and they took me to 18\" Street, near the zoo over there. It was a boarding house and they says you going to be here. They told me the next day, leave it to the Jewish Social Service Agency. They wrote down the address. The Jewish Social Service Agency at that time was on Spring Road which is right at 14\" Street. There was no suburbs then and being I was Columbia Road, right near the zoo which is Adams-Morgan now and Spring Street is not --. They gave me the address, I can take the bus. Over there, I was --- the lady she had lot a -- the Jewish Social Service paid her money. She put newcomers up with food. She gave me a room, she had a rooming house. She says you\u2019re going to be here until we find out what we going to do with you. The next day I went to the Jewish Social Service Agency and I had an interview with a Mr. Pixner. I think he just retired from the Jewish Social Service Agency. He asked me what I did and the war, where I\u2019m from, relatives, no relatives. He gave me $20 in my pocket. So I had $3 plus $20; I had $23. With $23, they says here\u2019s $20 and you will sightsee. They want me to go to the city, transportation because they put me up with food so I didn\u2019t need any food. I went back to the house and this lady, she packed my lunch. She says, I\u2019m a stranger in the city. I was afraid to venture too far out. She says well you can go to the zoo. The zoo was nearby. I could walk over there, Adams-Morgan. She gave me the lunch so she says it\u2019s a big zoo. Big zoo, I\u2019m afraid I might be lost in the zoo. So the first bench I approached I sat down and I ate my lunch up. I finished for the day. The next day I ventured out and I went to 14\" Street. That time 14\" Street was all white and you could walk. It wasn\u2019t like after before the riots. I looked in different stores. I saw a cleaning store and I see somebody reading a Jewish newspaper, I recognized it. I says maybe should go inside and ask him if he can find me a job. But I hesitated, I didn\u2019t go in. The following day, don\u2019t forget, I still had food, I went downtown. I think Lafayette Park or some place. I just sat down and men were sitting there. I struck up a conversation with him. He asked me where I\u2019m from and everything. I told him where I come from. He says he\u2019s an ex-Navy man. He was in the Seabees. He says he lives on 14\" Street with his wife. He lives in the Cavalier Apartments on 14\" Street. I was still living far away like I told you, near the zoo which is all in walking distance. He says why don\u2019t you come and I want my wife to meet you. Okay, so maybe the next day, I went and met his wife. He says you know we have to find you a room where you can stay. I told him I don\u2019t like where I stay. We could find you a job. I think he gave me dinner and he said would you like to -- so he says we find a job first. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be able to find a room. How you going to pay? He asked me what I did. I says I don\u2019t know. I worked for the American army, he kitchens. They going to find you a job in People\u2019s Drug Store. In the commissary at night. Are you familiar with Washington? They had counters with food and all this stuff. He took me to the Personnel and they find a job. So I work at night. He says well, we got to get youa room. I didn\u2019t like my job. I didn\u2019t like ay nights sleeping in the daytime, work at night. I cannot meet nobody. I was working there maybe for a week or for two weeks. Then he says now we go into the People\u2019s Drug Stores, 14\" and Park Road was a drug store and they have notices, who rents for rooms. Inside of a day, he saw a room for rent right around the corner where he lives. We went over there and we talked to the man. They were refugees too. They were German Jewish refugees but they arrived there before the war. But they were still refugees. He recognized my accent. Where you from, from Poland? I told him. He says where do you work? I says I just got a job at People\u2019s overnight. I don\u2019t like this job and the work at night. He says you know what, he says. I got a cousin; he\u2019s got a restaurant. Let me call up; if he needs somebody. He calls him up and this cousin live around the neighborhood. He was living Arkansas Avenue, in walking distance too. He says I have a young man, he\u2019s from Poland, he works at night. Do you think you can use him? He says bring him over. He says, you work the same evening. We walk over the same evening come over, how you doing, like with wine. All right, a little bit of wine, Manischievez. He says I have a place downtown near Thomas Circle. He says come over there. If you like it, you take the job. If you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s fine too. The next day I go over there. It\u2019s a daytime job. He says, so you spend a day, what do you have to lose. You\u2019re off in the daytime, you work at night. I stayed there and I says I like it. He paid me a dollar an hour, 40- hour week. I took home $36 but I figured I have a room already. I paid $40 for my room, nice people, German people, nice and clean. I have aroom, I\u2019m single so I don\u2019t have to go out for food. I have a daytime job. I have my friend, a newly acquired friend, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown he was very nice. Once ina while Sally went over there and she ate and she says you learn English. How do you spoke, transportation. Very nice people, interested in them. You ask about school.. I enrolled in Americanization school. The Americanization school was then on 18\" and Columbia Road on California Street. I went to school and then I make all -- people from Poland and some from Lodz and some from different. Some from boys, some came to an uncle, some came to an aunt, some came just like me. That was in the evening. I had to be there seven o\u2019clock. I went there seven o\u2019clock. I learned about the poems Captain my Captain. You recite poems and sing. Don\u2019t forget we\u2019re all older people. Then I make friends. On the weekend I have where to go. I have already friends and I have a daytime job. I ask them what do you do for a living. One worked for an uncle, one worked in a tailor shop, one works here, one is giving a party. Then I met my wife because I didn\u2019t. I met some guy, he says we\u2019re going to have a party this weekend. Could you come along. He took me along and my wife, she came to her uncle. They were living off -- they had already a nice house. Uncle was in business. You know who lives in the house? Fauntleroy."

I\u2019m acquiring a family now with a wife, with relatives. I don\u2019t have anybody, now I got to go away. All right but I have to go. The induction center I had to report on New York Avenue. I go down there and the first time I must have been late. Because we were living northwest and I didn\u2019t know the bus connections. I was late and the bus left me . The clerk over there, 1t was a legitimate excuse, I was just late. She says well you come back next week. She put it down on my paper. The next week I was there a little bit earlier. I came back next week and we took us down to Alexandria. I think it\u2019s Cameron (?) Station. You\u2019re familiar with it? We went through the whole process tests and everything. Then we had to go for interview. I went for interview. The captain calls me in because I couldn\u2019t speak -- broken English and probably didn\u2019t make out too good in my tests. I didn\u2019t understand some questions. He find out that I was in Buchenwald. He says, I liberated Buchenwald. He says I\u2019m going to give you a postponement for one year until you are a little more familiarized yourself with the country. We put you 4F now. In one year, they called me back. At that time, I was already more organized and they called me back. I had to report to Ft. Meade. I was drafted, I was two years. I came in -- I went in as a private, I came out as a sergeant. I took my basic training with the 101\u2018 Airborne in Kentucky and then I got assigned to Ft. Bragg, North Carolina which was good for me because I was stationed there."

Then I got discharged from the service. I was looking for a job so I got a job from the Giant maybe for a year or two. Then I worked for my wife\u2019s Uncle Ben here, a liquor store. Then I went back to the guy, the restaurant who gave me the first job. Over there, I met somebody who 1s a salesman.

Then I got back to work for the American army and this like this. Then the pogroms set in in Poland. In Kielce when I was there. I heard different stories that the people who came back from the camp, who came back to the hometowns, and the Poles made sarcastic remark. So many of you still survive! I thought you all dead and things like that. Then as things became known, when they liquidated the ghetto, the most of them went to Kelna and then they went to Auschwitz. Then I considered, I looked at the picture, my father was already 40 years old. He was born in 1900. He was 44 years, it\u2019s not old but the Germans done that and you don\u2019t have much food to eat, you look like an old man. My mother, one year younger. Then I had a younger brother. He was at that time, he was born in 1929 so that makes him in 1945, 12, 13, so it\u2019s a very slim chance to survive. But I did, I was writing letters to friends because I know I had some friends. As a matter of fact, right after the war I came in contact with some people from France. They were in the French army but they were touched in Nuremberg. Somehow I got to know them. They tried to help but I didn\u2019t get any response. I wrote to the French government, to different organizations and -- but then after right now with the Clarks affair and -- things like this, I obtained a letter from the Clarks and I notice that my aunt was on the transport on the list. I have the list upstairs too so it\u2019s a very slim chance to survive. I didn\u2019t hear anything. Besides I registered in Jerusalem and I registered in Germany. They have all my records from the date of inception. I figured if a younger brother is looking for me, he could find me easily so I never knew. I wondered many times but --."

But then somehow, I think Truman, they passed a law, Congress passed a law, they got to admit 200 or 250 thousand refugees. I wasn\u2019t the first one to believe in it so my friend, he 1s the first one who entered Munch. But he brought me back to prove that he registered, he didn\u2019t have anybody. I went after that too. From that time, I knew I\u2019m going to have it easy because I didn\u2019t engage in smuggling, black markets.

I wouldn\u2019t condemn the whole race or the whole nation but a lot of people could\u2019ve survived. The populations was very hostile in Europe, in Eastern Europe especially. In Western Europe it was a different story but in Eastern Europe, the Jews were always second-class citizens. Even right now, I\u2019m reading the stories like after cleaning of the Warsaw ghetto, they brought the people from Auschwitz to clean the Warsaw ghetto. When the Poles made a revolt, they freed some of the inmates. The revolt didn\u2019t last long but just for six weeks or so. They freed some of the inmates, they cleaning the Warsaw ghetto. They said we want to free Poland with our Jews. Some of them got killed after the war so that what it is. That\u2019s man inhumanity to man. Right now if you see something wrong, you stand up and get to be counted. That\u2019s exactly what it means -- man\u2019s inhumanity to man. It\u2019s an old poem, I don\u2019t know if you read. It\u2019s not a poem, it was in the paper. A German priest writes. He says when Hitler came into power in 1933, he said, they start persecuting the Jews. He says, I wasn\u2019t a Jew, I didn\u2019t spoke up. Then they take the homosexuals put them in concentration camp -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with it -- I wasn\u2019t a homosexual, I didn\u2019t speak up. Then they took the clergy, the Protestants, I wasn\u2019t a Protestant, I didn\u2019t spoke up. It came to the Catholic, I wasn\u2019t a Catholic, I didn\u2019t spoke up. It came to me, there was nobody else to speak up for me. That\u2019s the way it is. That\u2019s what it is."
