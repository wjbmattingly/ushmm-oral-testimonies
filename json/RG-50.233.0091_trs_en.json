Friday was ma rket day, especially with the Jewish people. They went to buy the stuff for th e Sabbath. There wasn\u2122t like a grocery store. You went to open market and you came back in the morning. It was eight, nine o\u2122clock; the weather was crisp; everybody was talking about the war. I looked up the sky and I saw these planes with the top that time because the war hysteria was going already a week or two weeks before mobilization, talk about the Germans and things like this. On Friday, nothing happened to our city. The planes flew over in the morni ng. They were just like birds up in the sky, the sun was shining. Saturday, the planes came back again and the Poles were shooting up. You could see the tracer bullets, you don\u2122t know if you h it them or not. The pl anes flew right over, flew higher, nothing reached them. But Sunday, th ey flew very low. They came very low over the city and you could even see the pilot inside, very, very low. The city was in a panic. Everybody was going towards Warsaw. The Poles a ppealed to the populations, to able- bodied men, to go toward Warsaw. We\u2122re going make a defense line over there, a stand. My father left too. I remember we marched all night, 54 left Zgie rz, we left for the city. We went to a nearby village. I don\u2122t remember how many miles, maybe ten miles, 15 was a village. Everybody was just like -- refugees. We took a few possessions, a little bit of bread. At night, we got very scared because the Poles opened all the prisons and they let out all the inmates. I don\u2122t know if they were political inmates or criminal inma tes but you see a lot of people, they look like hoodlums with shaved heads. That night, my father left. He went toward Warsaw."

At that time, everything was disorganized already. It didn\u2122t take long for the Poles to get disorganized already. It didn\u2122t take long for the Poles to get disorg anized. They didn\u2122t send you a summons, you have to report. They just broadcast, by word of mouth that al l able bodied men who had served in the Polish army at one time or another had to report towa rds Warsaw. They named the city Lovitz or something, we\u2122re going to make there a defense. Me and my brother and my mother were left alone. We figured well, we cannot defend ourselves. We have no cl othes, nothing; we just left in a hurry. We went back towards Zgierz, our city. On the way, we encountered the Polish army coming back, disorganized, disheveled w ith horses with wagons, some on foot. I didn\u2122t see any mechanized unit, none whatsoever. We came back to our home and the neighbors said they were glad to see us back, even though they were Poles. They gave us milk and bread and things like that. I wasn\u2122t there maybe one hour or two, I heard shooting. My neighbor who was a man, he didn\u2122t run away because he owned a fa rm nearby. He said the Germans are coming. He probably got wind of it before. We were into like a shelter. I don\u2122t know if it was a shelter or maybe an empty cellar, I don\u2122t know. We were there for a few hours, we heard shooting, then we came out and the Germans were here. The next morning, we went outside and we saw strange uniforms, not like the Polish army. We saw a lot of looting, knocking off the stores, everything was in disarray. We see whole co lumns of Germans going towards Warsaw.

When I mentione d it that there were two Jews working in the factory, I was talking about two Jews like working people. But in the office, there were a few more Jewish people working over there. One of the Jews, he was really from Lodz, he worked at Zgierz and he was commuting because he cam e with the tramway every morning. We find out that he has a lot of-- he knew a lot of people, he\u2122s got a lot of pull. My father went to him and asked him if he can help us out; we need some quarters where to live. He sure did. We got that room because apartments were very scarce. They put in the Jews from the city of Lodz itself, from all the environs. They put them in a small section and it wa s the worst section, the most dilapidated section in the city. They assign ed us a Jewish quarter. We had one room, just one room. It served as a kitc hen and everything, just one room for four people. Then -- that was in -- yeah, also for the refugees who came fr om the environs, they opened public kitchens. This was all in the fall of 1939. I even rememb er the next Passover which was the next spring like April now, was still the public kitchens, we eat in the public kitchens because we were refugees.

The Germans, at that time, in 1940, beginning of \u212241, they didn\u2122t quite decide to exterminate the Jews yet. They put them in ghettos, they concentrate them in centers but I think the Wannsee started a little bit later on, in 1942. So that time we still received packages and mail and Jews came from Prague, from Germany. They had relatives; there were mi xed marriages and mixed partners maybe who didn\u2122t come to the ghetto and they sent packag es.

There was no heating, no fuels, when you came to the houses, you knock on the door, like you had something, a summons for them to report for a settlement or something, you had to go they were all laying in the beds -- were hunger -- they were dying with hunger, very bad.

While they were going from the enclave out to the distribution corners to take it, they had, they were guarded with Jewish police. They just had armbands, they didn\u2122t have any guns. They were standing on the plan ks or going behind the wagon if a potato fell off, they picked it up and put it back in the wagon and things like that. Potatoes came in and flour came in and beets came and flour came. Don\u2122 t forget, after all they had 160,000 Jews. The Jews baked their own bread but to work in the bakery was a privilege.

The pe ople had assembled there, like I said, but some people, they really went for work outside the ghetto. Because they had to go to a commission; they had German doctors and they really needed them to work. But if they took everybody, whole families, you know they didn\u2122t take these peopl e to work. They just said you have to be resettled in the east. Like I said, I was hiding; then one day after maybe a week\u2122s time or so, I had to report. So I was there for three, four days in the central prison. I remember my father came the last days towards the barbed wire. I remember the picture ju st like vividly. I remember what he looked like. In Europe he was wearing boots and I remember his face like -. So we march, the next morning we march to the train station, we marched, all young people, no adult with us. Youngsters, I was there maybe si xteen, seventeen already. They put us in an open cart, put us in one of the good wagons, cattle cars and they closed up. We were riding for two, three hours. All of a sudden, they open th e door. There was a truck waiting there and the Germans waiting there. I don\u2122t remember how many people, maybe 50 people from our wagon, whatever it was. Maybe 50, maybe 60, I didn\u2122t count them; they took us to a labor camp. It was in Kielce. It was in southern Poland. It\u2122s spelled K-i-e-l-c-e. I don\u2122t know if you heard of it before. They took us over there and we asked how -- I seen them loading up our clothes, our baggage. We had on the truck and then -- they had already a labor camp. That camp still had Jews already from the surrounding vicinities. The camp was adjoining a factory. The factory was called Hasac. It was a Polish munitions fact ory before the war or maybe it was just a metal factory, I don\u2122t know. The German s converted this to a munitions factory. Over there, in comparison to the ghetto, was good because I had plenty food, as much as I want. The only this, you came in contact with the Poles. You work in the factory besides with the Poles. So we went to the barracks after finish the work but they went to their homes. They promised us that they going to give us the clothes, I seen them loading the truck. We ask them, where is the clothes, we never got the clothes. I only had what I had on me."

I had an extra sweater, maybe an extra pants, an extra pair shoes. We were all probably gone for labor work so everybody took a little bit clothes. They never gave it to us. This was good clothes because we took nothing but the best. I could barter this if I had it. I remember I just had one sweater, some I give it away and the Pole, the next day, brought me a loaf of bread or something like that. But food was relatively good because the locals, they were locals in the adjoining cities a nd they probably came with all the clothes. They were bartering all the time so they didn\u2122t eat in the commune kitchen. Was always a lot of food. Then at night, I could go to the Polish kitchen if they had food left over, they gave us if I worked the night shift. In comparison to the ghetto, as far as food was concerned, was gold. I was always worried about what happened to my parents, everything seemed unr eal. I got up in the morning, everything strange. I worked in the factory; I was making bullets. We put in steel and the machines, if you\u2122re working steel with the mach ines, had to have oil, constant to the oil. Like I said, I don\u2122t have any clothes to ex change nothing so_________ got all over me and I developed all blisters. I had all blisters on my knee, on my feet . Because I had no apron, just plain clothes and I had nothing to change. Don\u2122t forget I menti oned that I had left in March, 1944 but then the weather was getting colder. I went out in the morning to work. They marched us from the assembling, we had to march to factory. We didn\u2122t have to march too far, just like from here to the light because the camp was attached to the factory. But a cold day, it hit my flesh and it was hurting because I had blisters. When I was in that labor camp in Kielce, I heard about the invasion, the Normandy invasion in June 6. I heard that. But that time, I really didn\u2122t know where Normandy was; I just heard that the American s and the British was there, I don\u2122t have any perception of time; ma ybe the camp, maybe two, three months. It was the summer and then one morni ng, this camp, we were guarded by the Ukrainians. A Ukrainian auxiliary this camp. You mentioned if so mebody escaped from the ghetto and I told you I didn\u2122t know of anybody. But from the camp, I di d heard that they escaped, from the labor camp. But they caught him and then they brought him back and then they shot him. It was a different part of the country, they did escape and they brought him back. This was still in the summertime, after the Normandy invasion. It was in June, maybe July or maybe August, one morning they lined us all up and they say they have to evacuate because the Russian made the offensive. They were coming westward so they evacuated us and they put us in open flatcars. We were riding maybe a day or two and then they let us out in an open field. They gave us food; the Germans were debating where they should take us. They didn\u2122t know what to do with us -- all the people from the la bor camp. Was not a big camp, maybe six, seven hundred people. As I mentioned before, only about 50, 60 people. They had the whole wagons left over but they dropped them off in different camps. This camp only attached this car, maybe away to another couple cities, attached like a_________ camp. They didn\u2122t know where to take us, we said why can\u2122t we go back -- we still in Poland -- we said why can\u2122t you take us b ack to the Lodz ghetto? There\u2122s a lot of Jews over there. One of the guys told us, the Lodz ghetto is being evacuated, dismantled now. Right now, we in the field, it wa s still warm, must have been in August. Now according to the books that I read, that was when the ghetto was being liquidated, in July and August. After a couple of days, we decided and they took us to a place, Shedbush. We still in Poland, I find it on the map, wasn\u2122t far away , maybe 25 miles away. Anyway it was all youngsters and we were digging ditches, anti-tank ditches. The organization Todd was in charge, T-o-double-d. It was named after a Germ an, it was a labor battalion or something like that. We came, in the morning, in the daytime we went to dig the ditches and at night we were sleeping in barns, in farmers\u2122 barns. But at ni ght, we heard shooting. In the morning we got up and we ask the German what is all the shooting? We heard the partisans, they were attacking the German units or something like this in the co untryside. So after we dig the ditches, I don\u2122t know, maybe for a week or so, they took us away to Chintzerhau_____. The Chintz_______ is a -- I think it\u2122s near Upper Silesia -- it\u2122s a very well known Po lish city. The Polish Madonna -- Chintz_________ is on the Polish-German border not far away in Upper Silesia. The same factory with the same work that I did in Kielce that I did in Chintz________. Over there, I met my friend. I met my friend which I still keep up to now; he is in New York."

Somehow my memory fades but he\u2122s got a very good recollection and I met him. I re member the day; he was wearing boots. Over there maybe you worked about maybe for a month or two, was all_________, 1944, remember. We went in the morning --. He wasn\u2122t in Kiel ce with Gara; he was in a different camp. He was in Scarzilsco. By then, when the Germans came, they evacuated everybody and every ablebodied men they put in --. He came in Chin tz_________ and I met him. We were working in the same factory. I don\u2122t know if we worked th ere for a month or six weeks. Anyway, it was still the same year; the German s came one morning, rounded us up and marched us to the train station. They put us on cattle cars and I coul d see that the local population, they were running. We heard distant shooting. I don\u2122t know, rumors spread in ou r ranks that the Russians are entering the city on the other side but it wasn\u2122t tr ue yet. I could see the Germans were loading the big guns on the trains, the German army. Anyw ay they put us on cattle cars. We were gone for three or four days and we wind up in Germany. We find out that they took us \u0152 we went to Buchenwald in the concentration camp. Over there they opened up, we came to Buchenwald and everybody was eating up whatever they had in the food packages with them. They were discarding the Polish money and the German Reich marks. After two, three hours, we went to sit in barracks. They had -- Buchenwald was a big camp, was about 60,000 inmates at that time. It was established early in 1933. Ri ght now, I know it was a political camp. In Buchenwald heather on the ground. But that time I didn\u2122t realize, I didn\u2122t realize that. Anyway we registered and all the inmates did all the work. They ask us where we come from, your mother\u2122s name, your father\u2122s name and all this stuf f. After registration, we went to a big hall. We had to take all the clothes th at we wear and before I left Poland, I mentioned that before I left the ghetto, my mother told me that you have an aunt in Paris which I did have, her sister. She says you have a cousin in Belgium and she gave me addressed e nvelopes and things like that and says maybe you don\u2122t know where you\u2122re going. Maybe you\u2122re going to need it one day. But when I went to Buchenwald and I had family pictures, my mother, my younger brother, I had to put everything on the table. A ll the clothes, everything on the table and I only remember one German. A black uniformed German came in, we all had to o to commission. He looked at my legs because like I said, from the dirty oil, I don\u2122t know what I blubbered up in German. He says, he just looke d at me and was thinking, thinking. He just motioned at a line so I went over there. We had to go in first to a shower. I remember we just looking is water coming in or gas coming out. Water was coming out and then we had to all to go in. They had a big disinfection tube, was maybe like this room. Had to jump in, oh I had all scabs over here --- was burning and burning. Before this, I forgot, after I took all the clothes off and everything, we went to a different room. The inmates were all, the inmates had clippers. They clipping the head, clipping hair, clipping hair, all over there. Then we were all clipped up. We had to jump into this tub, this disinfect thing. Oh, it was burning somethi ng terrible. Then we jumped out. This was January, was already January. _______know s, January 18, according to the record, I got there, January 18. We went up from this tube, oh yeah, after we got up from the tube, I remember going up a flight of stairs. They gave me clothes. They gave me a pair boots, shoes, no socks. They gave me pants but no underwear. They gave me a jacket but no shirt. I didn\u2122t have the striped jacket, just because, don\u2122t forget , it was January and it was already chaos in all those camps. They had so many people come from Germany, I didn\u2122t even have a tattoo. I just had an assigned number. They gave me all these clothes. Then we went out to the other end of the barracks where we stand for two, three hours until we assigned a barrack. Here it\u2122s January, it\u2122s cold."

I was in this barracks and then later on -- when I was in the barracks, I met my friend. But first of all, they had kapos in the barracks. I didn\u2122t know what the word kapo means but I know people came to us and he says you people are newcomers? I says yes. I says who is your leader. We called, one was a Jewish policemen in th e labor camp was this. They want to find out how we are treated .If we told him; we are treated by ou r own people, they kill him on the spot. Because they say we want to do an example, in case they take your people out for labor for a day or two to the city a nd somebody is going to inform on you, your own people;___________ when he comes back, he\u2122s going to have the same thing. He says we\u2122re organizing the thing. I remember one guy, he was the head of the camp. He came to us and says, don\u2122t say anything bad. Because we always thought maybe we came from the ghetto from Lodz, they didn\u2122t give us our clothes, we coul d have lived better. Buy different food, but I don\u2122t know what happened to him. Maybe some body else squealed on him, maybe not, I don\u2122t know. I was in that camp and then I met my frie nd, it was nice. The first day, when I assigned my rations, I put it in my pocket. I figure I\u2122m going to eat it later on. You get one day of rations, a piece of bread and a bowl of soup so I fi gure I\u2122m going to eat the bread at night. So at night, I went to eat, the bread was gone. Somebody slipped it out a nd I didn\u2122t feel it. I figured out, don\u2122t ask me know but I don\u2122t know. I remember one thing, I sewed up my pockets. Don\u2122t ask me where I got the needle and where I go t the thread. Somebody must have had it. I punched a hole in the jacket through here and I was slitting out to here. While I was in this barrack, they took out people for work, the kapos. They had people in the barracks, they had people -- Germans, they had Russians who pr eceded us to Buchenwald. Some people who came maybe in 1939, in 1940, in 1938, they were in char ge of the barracks, they were in charge. The kapos, they had to go to a special appellplatz, the main camp where they counted them. We had to go to a different spot too. Sometimes, we stayed for two, three hours in the snow, don\u2122t forget it was January. The snowflakes they were falling; he counted us up, then dismissed. Then dismisses, you went into a cold barrac k. If you had a piece of bread left over in the morning, you ate it. If not, nothing. In daytime, in the morning, we heard a whistle blowing. They took us for work, from the barracks, just to drag wood because you have to remember that Buchenwald was carved out from a forest. I don\u2122t know if you\u2122re familiar or not. It\u2122s ten miles away from Weimar. It\u2122s a lot of birch trees a nd forest. Maybe they need the wood, maybe they didn\u2122t need it. They just make you work. They don\u2122t let you just stay around idle. They were taking us out for work every day."

I\u2122m interested because I lived this period; I know that right now from history was a criminal camp. One of the Germa n, Admiral Kanaris, he was head of the German Upfeur, German intelligence. He got hung up over there. In the middle of the story or not. Over there, was even worse than Buchenwald because we were sleeping --. I was with my friend there from New York and we sleeping that camp maybe for a week or so. Then they say they evacuated Flossenburg. Thy marched us out fr om Flossenburg to the train.

I know the sun was shining high and the train station was right outside of the camp and they lo ading us in open boxcars, listen to that. The trains didn\u2122t even start moving yet.

A crossing sign, you know, maybe one of the splinters, some bullet too, hit me in the face. But nothing was bleeding, it wa s nothing, something hit me. When the planes shot up the train, everybody jumped off the train so I jumped off the train too. The Germans were running to the farmhouses, to the nearby houses. I run after them too.

After the ride was over, if the locomotive was in tact, it wasn\u2122t shot up, they could use it. It came back and they pull off agai n. But if the locomotive didn\u2122t have time, they had to get something else. But anyway, they shot up a locomotive the last time and they couldn\u2122t get anybody so a big fat German says, everybody line up. Whoever cannot -- we going to march from now on. Whoever cannot march doesn\u2122t have to worry, we going to provide transportation. I know what transportation means. I was the first in line. Now I can see how lucky I am because, don\u2122t forget, I was in this labor camp, like I mentioned before the food was relatively good. I could barter, the locals, so it was more food left for me. I was in the kitchen at night and it was food and the camp was only fo r about three months so I was in relative good health. I was in the first line over there. We marched all night, me and my friend from New York. Then at night, we wind up near the roadside and we took a little bi t leaves and they says you\u2122re going to spend the night over there. The next night the same thing. But the third night, was raining bad. I got soaked all through, all wet. Whoever fell out of line, if you read the story about Bataan or Corregidor, the same thing. I was ready, my friend was ready, I was ready to go the roadside but my friend who liv es in New York, he says, come on."

Towards morning, it was already daybreak, we stopped on a farm and they put us in barns. They says you\u2122re going to rest here, the guards. All of a sudden, decide to take us all out for punishment because somehow, somebody, they were messing up the barns. There were no toilets there. They were lining everybody up. They going to take us to a march or maybe, who knows. The Germans had a tendency. If somebody did any infracti ons, they lined everybody up and they picked people at random. They lined them up and they says I\u2122m going to pick every third man, or every tenth man. They just pull them out and they just shot them just for no reason at all. So maybe they tried to do the same thing this time. When they were getting ready, everybody lined up, we heard shooting. So the German says everybody back inside the barn. Then the shooting intensified. Like I mentioned, it\u2122s a barn. A barn has slits so some of the inmates looked --. Before I mention that, for some reason an e gg fell down, a chicken egg fell down and my friend was nearby. We took the egg and we split it in ha lf, a fresh egg. While we were sitting in the barn, like I mentioned before, it was raining all ni ght and the barn is warm near the hay and the straw, our clothes is steaming. We heard the shooting and we looked out. Some of the inmates says, the Russians are here. They saw the stars. At that time, we di dn\u2122t know the American tanks have stars too. We know the Russians have st ars. Then we notice in the front of the barn the guards taking white handkerchiefs, or white rags or whatever it was white and put on the front of their rifles.

Don\u2122t forget they evacuated th e camp like Buchenwald in the thousands. The Germans had the transport too with them. They had the carts and the horses and some motor transports. All of a sudden you see the inmates they robbing the wagons and all the stuff. I went to a wagon too, seeing some German boots. I had no shoes, I put on a pair of boots. I had no size, just pulled them on. Like I mentioned before, don\u2122t forget, I said I sewed up the pockets. I go over there and I see a big German woman. She has a big country bread all around.

Then they said, all of a sudden, they had to leave too, after two, three months. By that time, I was working over there, I also find out that the size of this was Nuremsbek. There is a sizeable Jewish community in Furt. Furt, it\u2122s Bavaria too. It\u2122s spelled F-u-r-t. We took the streetcar from Nuremberg and you went to Furt. They had Jewish community there and they were all newcomers and had a home too. Just like a house but I was not living in this house. I think we all had a tent to ourselves, was handy there. At that time came to go too. So they said they\u2122re going back to the United States but before they sa y, they pack for their vacation. They going to leave from Marseilles, France. So they had tw o choices. We can either leave you in Germany and find you another job with the American army or we can give you back to France. At that time France was right after post-war in \u212245, they could bring across the border. You know in \u212245, is everything chaos still. He says -- we figure, well if they going to dump us off in France, we\u2122re on our own, don\u2122t know anybody. Here I fi nd up, the community of Furt and things like that. I felt already a little bond. So he says why don\u2122t you find us a job here? Next to the where they had the tents, was the American hospita l. I have letters from the hospital. They give letters of recommendation, 381 st Evacuation Hospital or something like this. We decide to work over there and they give us quarters and they give us food. Like I said, we had all the clothes, we had a room. Inside, was no tents, already in the hospital, had separate rooms, three, four boys. In the morning, we just went to work in the kitchen. We were not cooking; they had army cooks. You know what we were in charge ? We were lighting the stoves. You remember the field army stoves, are you familiar with that?"

Then, like I said, my friend, the one I spend the war with, he found himself a job too. He found himsel f a job in the adjoining city with the American army too. He told me he heard -- heard a lot of the people who are liberated, they go to America. They have relatives but I didn\u2122t have anybody so nothing to cl aim. Then he told me that if you go to Munich, Congress passed a law, he told me the American government -- I didn\u2122t know the difference between Congress and no Congress that so me displaced person they can register with the Joint. He went first and he came back, he sa ys yes, you can register. I went there too and I registered and I had a very easy time because af ter the war I worked. I had recommendations from the army, had a good police record. Then I re gistered and I was -- oh yes, then I think that I went to be on my own. I still worked for the hos pital, I worked for a while but I didn\u2122t want to live over there. Because in the evening I want to be free. I want to be with my own people and I put an ad in the paper. I\u2122m looking for a room . Rooms are very hard to get in Germany after the war. But I mentioned, I want to mention that a lot of German Jews came back, German Jews after the war. They were liberated or so me maybe were never in a camp; they were mixed marriages and maybe the Germans didn\u2122t touch th em. Anyway I went once to a service in Nuremberg, Jewish service. There were a lo t of German Jews there who came back from Theresienstadt and things like th at. I find out that they had very high positions in the post-war government in Germany right after the war. I want to live on my own. I talked to them and one told me he works in this ministry, the other in th e other ministry. So I put an ad in the paper, I want to be on my own for a room. I got a res ponse like in a post office box. I went to look at the room and the room was right near the Palace of Justice, near the military tribunal, where they tried the Nazis. As a matter of fact, th e building was right across the street, I seen the Soviets on the balcony. They were living ther e too. The people who we re attached to the Justice, to the Russian delegation. Anyway I looked at the room and the lady asked me what I do. I told her I am working at the hospital. She says yeah? I says I\u2122m Jewish. She says oh, yeah. After the war, everybody had a Jewish re lative. She says you know what, I registered this room, she says, with the government because I don\u2122t want them to assign me a newcomer from -- an ethnic German from the displaced, fr om Schlis____ or something like this. If you can get it, if somehow you can br ing a certificate that you want the room. I made contact with this German ministry. I tell him, listen I have a room but I need assignment. No problem, he gave me an assignment, I was living over there. Then my papers came through. They call me to the council. I had to give the birth certificate. I don\u2122t have a birth certificate, if you come from Europe, everything was taken away. Th at was relatively easy, you find people from your hometown. They know I\u2122m from Poland so I ha d this witnesses where I was born, where I\u2122m from and I assembled different papers. We get them translated into English. I went for the interview.

She gave me the lunch so she says it\u2122s a big zoo. Big zoo, I\u2122m afraid I might be lost in the zoo. So the first bench I approached I sat down and I ate my lunch up. I finished for the day. The next day I ventured out and I went to 14th Street. That time 14 th Street was all white and you could walk. It wasn\u2122t like after________ before the riots. I looked in differen t stores. I saw a cleaning store and I see somebody reading a Jewish newspaper, I recognized it. I says maybe should go inside and ask him if he can find me a job. Bu t I hesitated, I didn\u2122t go in. The following day, don\u2122t forget, I still had food, I went downtown. I th ink Lafayette Park or some place. I just sat down and men were sitting there. I struck up a conversation with him. He asked me where I\u2122m from and everything. I told him where I come from . He says he\u2122s an ex-Navy man. He was in the Seabees. He says he lives on 14th Street with his wife. He lives in the Cavalier Apartments on 14th Street. I was still living far away like I to ld you, near the zoo which is all in walking distance. He says why don\u2122t you come and I want my wife to meet you. Okay, so maybe the next day, I went and met his wife. He says you know we have to find you a room where you can stay. I told him I don\u2122t like where I stay. We could find you a job. I think he gave me dinner and he said would you like to -- so he says we find a job first. Otherwise you wouldn\u2122t be able to find a room. How you go ing to pay? He asked me what I did. I says I don\u2122t know. I worked for the American army, he kitchens. They going to find you a job in People\u2122s Drug Store. In the commissary at night. Are you fa miliar with Washington? They had counters with food and all this stuff. He took me to the Personn el and they find a job. So I work at night. He says well, we got to get you a room. I didn\u2122t like my job. I didn\u2122t like ay nights sleeping in the daytime, work at night. I cannot meet nobody. I was working there maybe for a week or for two weeks. Then he says now we go into the People\u2122s Drug Stores, 14 th and Park Road was a drug store and they have notices, who rents for rooms. Inside of a day, he saw a room for rent right around the corner where he lives. We went over there and we talked to the man. They were refugees too. They were German Jewish re fugees but they arrived there before the war. But they were still refugees. He recognized my accent. Where you from, from Poland? I told him. He says where do you work? I says I just got a job at Peopl e\u2122s overnight. I don\u2122t like this job and the work at night. He says you know what, he says. I got a cousin; he\u2122s got a restaurant. Let me call up; if he needs somebody. He calls him up and this cousin live around the neighborhood. He was living Ar kansas Avenue, in walking distance too. He says I have a young man, he\u2122s from Poland, he works at night. Do you think you can use him? He says bring him over. He says, you work the same evening. We walk over the same evening come over, how you doing, like with wine. All ri ght, a little bit of wine, Manischievez. He says I have a place downtown near Thomas Circle. He says come over there. If you like it, you take the job. If you don\u2122t like it, it\u2122s fine too. The next day I go over there. It\u2122s a daytime job. He says, so you spend a day, what do you have to lose. You\u2122re off in the daytime, you work at night. I stayed there and I says I like it. He paid me a dollar an hou r, 40- hour week. I took home $36 but I figured I have a room already. I paid $40 for my room, nice people, German people, nice and clean. I have a room, I\u2122m single so I don\u2122t ha ve to go out for food. I have a daytime job. I have my friend, a newly acquired friend, Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown he was very nice. Once in a while Sally went over there and she ate and she says you learn English. How do you spoke, transportation. Very nice people, interested in them. You ask about school.. I enrolled in Americanization school. The Amer icanization school was then on 18th and Columbia Road on California Street. I went to school and then I make all -- people from Poland and some from Lodz and some from different. Some from boys, some came to an uncle, some came to an aunt, some came just like me. That was in the evening. I had to be there seven o\u2122clock. I went there seven o\u2122clock. I learned about the poems Capt ain my Captain. You recite poems and sing. Don\u2122t forget we\u2122re all older people. Then I make friends. On the weekend I have where to go. I have already friends and I have a daytime job. I ask them what do you do for a living. One worked for an uncle, one worked in a tailor shop, one works here, one is giving a party. Then I met my wife because I didn\u2122t. I met some guy , he says we\u2122re going to have a party this weekend. Could you come along. He took me along and my wife, she came to her uncle. They were living off -- they had already a nice house. Uncle was in business. You know who lives in the house? Fauntleroy."

I says I just came from -- I don\u2122t want to sound like a________. I want to go in the army but I just came from a camp and all of a sudden, I got to go aw ay. I\u2122m acquiring a family now with a wife, with relatives. I don\u2122t have anybody, now I got to go away. All right but I have to go. The induction center I had to report on New York Avenue . I go down there and the first time I must have been late. Because we were living north west and I didn\u2122t know the bus connections. I was late and the bus left me__________. The clerk over there, it was a legitimate excuse, I was just late. She says well you come back next week. She put it down on my paper. The next week I was there a little bit earlier. I came back next week and we took us down to Alexandria. I think it\u2122s Cameron (?) Station. You\u2122re familia r with it? We went through the whole process tests and everything. Then we had to go for interv iew. I went for interview. The captain calls me in because I couldn\u2122t speak -- broken English and probably didn\u2122t make out too good in my tests. I didn\u2122t understand some questions. He find out that I was in Buchenwald. He says, I liberated Buchenwald. He says I\u2122m going to give you a postponement for one year until you are a little more familiarized yourself with the count ry. We put you 4F now. In one year, they called me back. At that time, I was already more organized and they called me back. I had to report to Ft. Meade. I was drafte d, I was two years. I came in -- I went in as a private, I came out as a sergeant. I took my basic training with the 101st Airborne in Kentucky and then I got assigned to Ft. Bragg, North Carolina which was good for me because I was stationed there."

I have all the best recommendations. I show you later on after the interview is finished. I let you read about it. I came up top of the class. They gave me a set of knives and everythi ng. Then I got discharged from the service. I was looking for a job so I got a job from the Giant maybe for a year or two. Then I worked for my wife\u2122s Uncle Ben here, a liquor store. Then I went back to the guy, the restaurant who gave me the first job. Over there, I met somebody who is a salesman. He says I know of a place but you know the work, he tells me and I know who wants to sell it, so maybe you can take me as a partner. He says I\u2122m going to draw less than you do because I have a job. But I just going to be -- I\u2122m going to pull up the money just like you. Bu t you live in the house and I figure that that\u2122s a terrific idea for me. He know s the place so I went to look at the place. I bought the place and now I\u2122m already 19 years over there. I\u2122m going on 20 years. It\u2122s a very nice place. It\u2122s the United States Secret Service is over there. I know everybody over there and I have a good business.

            "answer": "Well, I tell you. I didn\u2122t find out. I want to go back to Poland right after when I mentioned it because I was barely one year over. Then I got back to work for the American army and this like this. Then the pogroms set in in Poland. In Kielce when I was there. I heard different stories that the people who came back from the camp, who came back to the hometowns, and the Poles made sarcastic remark. So many of you still survive! I thought you all dead and things like that. Then as things became kno wn, when they liquidated the ghetto, the most of them went to Kelna and then they went to Auschwitz. Then I considered, I looked at the picture, my father was already 40 years old. He was born in 1900. He was 44 years, it\u2122s not old but the Germans done that and you don\u2122t have mu ch food to eat, you look like an old man. My mother, one year younger. Then I had a younger brot her. He was at that time, he was born in 1929 so that makes him in 1945, 12, 13, so it\u2122s a very slim chance to survive. But I did, I was writing letters to friends because I know I had some friends. As a matter of fact, right after the war I came in contact with some people from Fran ce. They were in the French army but they were touched in Nuremberg. Somehow I got to k now them. They tried to help but I didn\u2122t get any response. I wrote to the French government, to different organizations and -- but then after right now with the Clarks_________affair and -- thi ngs like this, I obtained a letter from the Clarks_________and I notice that my aunt was on the transport on the list. I have the list upstairs too so it\u2122s a very slim ch ance to survive. I didn\u2122t hear a nything. Besides I registered in Jerusalem and I registered in Germany. They have all my records from the date of inception. I figured if a younger brother is looking for me, he could find me easily so I never knew. I wondered many times but --."

They took in people who were sponsored by somebody w ho guaranteed the highest, highest, highest. But then somehow, I think Truman, they passed a law, Congress passed a law, they got to admit 200 or 250 thousand refugees. I wasn\u2122t the first one to believe in it so my friend, he is the first one who entered Munch. But he brought me back to prove that he registered, he didn\u2122t have anybody. I went after that too. From that tim e, I knew I\u2122m going to have it easy because I didn\u2122t engage in smuggling, black markets. I ha d a legitimate job and all the recommendations so I know if that\u2122s the date, I be coming here. That\u2122s my story."

            "answer": "I was just saying --. What I wa nt to say, now things are differ ently. At that time in 1944, if people could help one another but they didn\u2122t. A lot of people kept silent. I wouldn\u2122t condemn the whole race or the whole nation but a lot of people could\u2122ve survived. The populations was very hostile in Europe, in Eastern Europe especially. In Western Europe it was a different story but in Eastern Europe, the Jews were always second-class citizens. Even right now, I\u2122m reading the stories like after cleaning of the Warsaw ghetto, they brought the people from Auschwitz to clean the Warsaw ghetto. When the Poles made a revolt, they freed some of the inmates. The revolt didn\u2122t last long but just fo r six weeks or so. They freed some of the inmates, they cleaning the Warsaw ghetto. They said we want to free Poland with our Jews. Some of them got killed after the war so that what it is. That\u2122s man inhumanity to man. Right now if you see something wrong, you stand up and get to be counte d. That\u2122s exactly what it means -- man\u2122s inhumanity to man. It\u2122s an old poem, I don\u2122t kno w if you read. It\u2122s not a poem, it was in the paper. A German priest writes. He says when Hitler came into power in 1933, he said, they start persecuting the Jews. He says, I wasn\u2122t a Jew, I didn\u2122t spoke up. Then they take the homosexuals put them in concentration camp -- I don\u2122t know if you\u2122re familiar with it -- I wasn\u2122t a homosexual, I didn\u2122t speak up. Then they took the clergy, the Pr otestants, I wasn\u2122t a Protestant, I didn\u2122t spoke up. It came to the Cath olic, I wasn\u2122t a Catholic, I didn\u2122t spoke up. It came to me, there was nobody else to speak up for me. That\u2122s the way it is. That\u2122s what it is."
