Mother \u2014 Mother had more expression I think basically and she enjoyed things more. She was a\u2014a-\u2014a delightfully humorous person, a lot of fun to be around. Dad, as I say, was more Interview with Richard Peterson \u00b0 April 6, 1999 serious, but he was a very, very, very fine person. And looking back, too, in the home, as I said, it was a lot of encouragement of reading and a lot of encouragement of motivation to do things. Dad was very active community-wise and he urged all of us to \u2014 to be involved in high school activities, other activities as well. An interesting thing about the family, though, you see, we\u2019re almost rather like two families. My \u2014 1n the sense that my sister was 11 years older, my brother nine, and I, as Mother said, the side dish that came on orders was that much younger, you see.

Quite unusual at that particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had both been in Europe. My Aunt Agnes had \u2014 had been in Germany a number of times and studied there. Aunt Belle had been with her also. But we would have, when Aunt Belle and Aunt \u2014 Aunt Agnes were there, talks about Europe and visiting about Europe. So really as younger people we were aware of at least Europe. Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly. And I\u2019m speaking now Interview with Richard Peterson ' April 6, 1999 of \u2014 of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of Europe.

We had radio news basically as well, too. So I think probably as \u2014 as things were beginning to develop, I remember discussions of the Spanish Civil War, that would be what, in the late 1930\u2019s. And then of course when the war itself began in the first or second of September 1939, why, we were much, much aware of it."

But it was in April, the next April, when Germany moved into first Denmark and then the Scandinavian countries, and that was very \u2014 very meaningful because I remember so well of going over that morning to Grandma and Grandpa\u2019s, they\u2019re still living. This time they were in \u2014 1n the 80\u2019s. But I can picture just as we talk right now, Grandpa Peterson sitting there in the sun in the early morning as if he were stunned. The war did come. And I said in Interview with Richard Peterson \u201d April 6, 1999 Danish, Bedstefar [Danish]. Yeah, da \u2014 I'll put it sa \u2014 put it in Danish again. [Speaks Danish here] The Germans have Denmark. And then in English he says, poor little Denmark, she couldn\u2019t do a thing. She couldn\u2019t do a thing. And he just \u2014he\u2019d been in the German army, you se \u2014 oh, I\u2019m sorry, the \u2014 the Danish army. And of course it was a great history in the 1860\u2019s when Grandpa was in Denmark growing up, of the first \u2014 you know, th-the first war with Germany. And then of course the World War II is \u2014 World War \u2014 war was there also, but this was a really traumatic thing for them.

We knew things of course were getting much more so because following that of course we recall Norway fell, and then of course Germany moved into \u2014 in to the low countries and on and then of course there was a lot of awareness when the German [indecipherable] went through the Ardennes, to the great \u2014 the great shock and surprise of the French and British.

At this time, age 16, realized that not fully as yet, but it was going to affect us. The next morning in the \u201cDes Moines Register\u201d there appeared a \u2014 a \u2014 the name was Ding Darling, he was one of the leading cartoonists in the country, and here was this \u2014 this drawing. It was of Uncle Sam kneeling, holding in his arms a sailor with a knife in his back. And Uncle Sam was looking up in fury and anger, shaking his fist at the departing Japanese aircraft. Powerful thing. I remem-mem- member very well, and that\u2019s one of the first times I ever remember seeing Dad in tears, at that. And that was now Monday morning at home. At school, Abraham Lincoln High School, our principal Mr. Kern, Gerald Kern, a \u2014 a very fine educator and he ran a tight school. He called the entire school body together, we were in the \u2014 the big, large auditortum. He perceived in his wisdom how he\u2019Il be affecting us, and he had brought \u2014 he brought in a large floor model radio which was up on the stage. And I can see him yet. The auditorium, large but couldn\u2019t take all of them, so there were other students in the aisles, the balcony, the whole thing. And we sat there in dead silence, and Mr. Kern turned on President Roosevelt\u2019s war message. And how interesting. I thought about it over the years. Over \u2014 over the \u2014 the \u2014 the stage, on the proscenium of the stage, in large gothic Interview with Richard Peterson : April 6, 1999 letters in high school were, ye come to learn, go forth to serve. How rather prophetic looking back, huh, at those times. That was Monday and then of course during the week, difficult. To drop back a bit though, the week before had been a tense week because I remember th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the [indecipherable] this country as we recall, as the special en \u2014 envoys, emissaries and there were big pictures of them in the paper, them smiling and very \u2014 you know. And then came the word about it. But I remember when, during the end of the week as we\u2019re reaching \u2014 it would have been in probably December fourth or fifth \u2014 third, fourth or fifth, that the word came that they were re-reaching some kind of an accord, they thought \u2014 I remember saying to Dad, Dad, how lucky \u2014 a war with Japan would be terrible, wouldn\u2019t it?

            "answer": "To a degree, but it was changing, because we realized things were indeed happening, and they already had, to this extent. The National Guard had been already brought into federal service by that time. I thi \u2014 I think that our local unit, which was the 168\" infantry of the na \u2014 34\" division had been mustered in in January the year before. And we were aware of it because a number of the high school student seniors were in the National Guard and they were gone. And I Interview with Richard Peterson \" April 6, 1999 remember then, it was in the \u2014 May of that year, which would have been 1941, before the war, but here they made arrangements and I remember being in \u2014 I was in the band and orchestra, and it was always typical that we would play, the orchestra, we would play \u2014 our \u2014 our school march was \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Chorus\u201d from Tannhauser. And \u2014 and Mr. Kern liked it, 1t was very good. Much better than \u201cPomp and Circumstance.\u201d But I remember being th \u2014 we were practicing and in came the high school seniors and I remember I was so, as a youngster, moved, because here were four, five or six of the high school students now on active duty, they were there in uniform, they came back to graduate. So that was \u2014 SO We were very much aware of it. And to drop back to your other question, how did it change? We were much aware, the \u2014 the high school paper, \u201cThe Echoes\u201d began having items more and more of classmates we had, or students who were now in the service, in the military, back and forth. As well, at our high school we had ROTC, junior ROTC, we were all in it, even band \u2014 band people had a military band and the whole thing. So there was more emphasis all the time. I mean that things are going to happen, young people and you\u2019ve got training that\u2019s going on here, it\u2019s going to be helpful to you. So the \u2014 the high school paper as I said, was carrying more and more news about people who graduated, and where they were training and so forth, so we\u2019re very much aware of it. And, may I add, Interview with Richard Peterson : April 6, 1999 the school activities began to be directed. Junior Red Cross, for example, was having more projects. As \u2014 as youngsters, I was involved with the Boy Scouts, the Boy Scout project even at that time was collecting aluminum, s-scrap aluminum to get for the war effort.

I went to Drake University in June, just after graduation for about \u2014 it was about a month, six weeks. Drake, because it had been Dad\u2019s school, it was a good school in Des Moines, and Dad\u2019s thought was, get as much education as you can before the military, which was exactly right. And then, after about six weeks there, I got word that I would be eligible for the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program, ASTRP. Reserve being for those who had not yet attained age 18 and you could go into the enlisted reserve, start off. And then, after finishing one\u2019s first term, and when you reached your 18\" birthday or past it, then that term would stop in school, you would be s \u2014 be \u2014 you would become a part of the army itself, be sworn in, have your basic training, then the program would come back to school afterwards. All right, to drop back now, my particular group that I qualified for, we were \u2014 I was still in Des Moines, Drake University. Down, I remember going downtown at the direction, and I had all the papers and so forth, I \u2014 in \u2014 Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 went into the enlisted reserve, took the oath basically and so forth. And then terminated my work at Drake, went home and oh then two or three weeks afterwards reported to then Fort Crook for induction into the actual \u2014 the actual service itself. Our group went to Kansas University at Lawrence, Kansas. And we began our first tour of ASTRP, all reservists, we had \u2014 we had uniforms, ROTC uniforms basically, the first part of August and we were there then with the first term of just basic engineering beginning supposedly, until we\u2019d accomplished our 18\" birthday. Mine was September 29\", you see. So I finished the first term, and then those of us that had reached age 18 then went home for a brief furlough, we reported to Camp Dodge in Iowa, then sworn into the army itself, huh, and then began our real army experience, because after the initial beginning in the army you have just your uniform, your shots, your medical, the whole thing, [indecipherable] orientation, then you are sent to a basic training camp.

To explain a bit further, in a division, infantry, about 15,000 men, one-half of those are infantry themselves, in Interview with Richard Peterson \u00b0 April 6, 1999 the form of three regiments. We were in 342\". The Blackhawk had regiments 341\", second and third. And every regiment then would have three battalions. A battalion would be composed of a headquarters company of the colonel, lieutenant colonel ba \u2014 of the lieutenant colonel basically, of the \u2014 of the battalion. The headquarters company had staff and there was a reconnaissance patrol and some other service. Then, in each \u2014 in each battalion beyond that, there were three rifle companies and a weapons company. And I \u2014 and I give this because it gives a better background for the future I think, too. A rifle company had approximately, in what was called the table of organization, TO, about 180 men commanded by, normally, a captain. And then there would be a lieutenant, who is called the platoon leader, for each of the four platoons. The \u2014 the three rifle platoons and the weapons platoon. And sometimes there would be another \u2014 another officer who 1s \u2014 be assistant \u2014 the assistant company commander. In our company it was Captain Mitchell, and then we had the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the four lieutenants. Basically \u2014 trying to recall base \u2014 the names we had ba \u2014 there was Lieutenant Hess, Lieutenant Budman(ph), Lieutenant Greenburg(ph). And those were basically the officers that we had. Each platoon, rifle platoon was composed of three squads of 12 men each. Was the platoon sergeant, a platoon guy, like an assistant, the assistant person. And then, for each squad, the squad leader was a staff sergeant, which is Interview with Richard Peterson \u201c\u00b0 April 6, 1999 the three chevrons and then the rocker underneath, an assistant squad \u2014 squad leader, who\u2019d be regular [indecipherable] and then the balance of the men will be 12 [indecipherable]. Be two scouts, two patro \u2014 two [indecipherable] of two squad scouts, a Browning automatic rifleman basically and other riflemen down the line, too. So therefore each \u2014 each rifle platoon had those people. In the weapons platoon. separate, those \u2014 those were the light machine guns, and there were two sections of those basically, with machine guns each and also mortars, which is 60 millimeter weapon, the tubes that fire the rockets, those thi \u2014 that would be a rifle company. There was also each ra \u2014 in each battalion, a heavy weapons company, which would be the \u2014 would be the \u2014 the \u2014 the water cooled heavy machine guns, and the 81 millimeter mortars. And so that was basically the structure of \u2014 of a regiment. And then we were A company of that, and I was in the first squad, third platoon. I was a scout, okay."

And we were located there, staging for probably 10 days, two weeks, getting ready to go up to the front. Some more equipment, some more training. As is \u2014 as a\u2014 as a Squad scout I was sent with my fellow scouts up to so called mine, m-i-n-e school, up at Sassentot, S-a-S-S-e-n-t-0-t to learn about German mines.

Not th \u2014 we would have much, but at \u2014 we theoretically, the scouts, you see, go out in front of the squad to study the terrain and so forth and then the squad leader in charge behind you controls your actions. So we had that, we were finishing that up and we got the word, okay men, fold up your tents, we\u2019re going back, we\u2019re going to be moving out, you\u2019re up tomorrow to the front. Back we went, down to Normanville and got ready to leave."

And I saw a lot of it as we went through and I think we had two hours basically and \u2014 but you watched and went through.

We arrived at the city of Duren, d-u-r-e-n in Germany, we were in Germany now. Off the trains and on the big trucks, which we call six by sixes.

But earlier bombardment had been so intense that the statue, the bronze statue had completely turned around. It had been facing one direction and now it Interview with Richard Peterson * April 6, 1999 was facing the other direction.

They pointed out the fact that it had apparently originally been facing on \u2014 to \u2014 t-to the west, but the \u2014 the arterial bombardment they had had in Duren was so intense that it had just shifted, the statue was facing east. Weird, weird. So here was dark, middle of the morning, cold, chilly. We \u2014 we were \u2014 we were course 1n \u2014 1n-1n-in March now. And out of Duren we drove, heading east toward Cologne."

I didn\u2019t know much German at all. I have a little more now, but not that much. Then, of course, in the morning it began getting lighter, you know, eerily morning. And began reli \u2014 we were driving through an area now heading east on the \u2014 a main, a fairly main roadway toward Cologne, which I Interview with Richard Peterson *\u00b0 April 6, 1999 think probably was about, I\u2019m guessing 30 - 40 miles east of Duren. But here we were, of course, basically in a truck going on east. We had seen, oh, forests to one side and then buildings. Then began to see a lot of bomb damage or some kind of damage to buildings, basically. And then we probably got into Cologne, I\u2019m guessing, in the con \u2014 with the truck convoy by \u2014 by seven, eight o\u2019clock in the morning, I\u2019m guessing. And that was something else. The \u2014 Cologne had been badly damaged, and yet, way up ahead were the two huge spires of the Cologne cathedral. Some damage, but they were standing, they were still there. And then off \u2014 truck stopped off into the house, and then in \u2014 into houses, apartments where we were being billeted. So then we were there in Cologne. Now, at that point something different happened. These were apartment houses, people\u2019s belongings, I mean their furniture and so forth. And somebody, strangely enough, began tossing the contents out of the windows into the central courtyard, just indiscriminately. And, was it the result of being in a foreign country, the enemy country?

We were moved into the house, we were supposed to be there for a day or so, something, til we\u2019re moved on Interview with Richard Peterson \u201c April 6, 1999 farther.

This was really, now will take us into Germany itself, okay. We left that suburb o-of Cologne, but not until after we became aware of the first fatality we\u2019d had in our company. We had some injuries because as the Germans were dropping these shells across, one shell I recall, an 88 fell right into th \u2014 into the kitchen area and injured, didn\u2019t \u2014 not badly, some of the cooks, shrapnel. And \u2014 an-and you had to watch it because you could sometimes hear the shells coming in and you\u2019d duck. And that was pretty unnerving for \u2014 this was our first [indecipherable]. But then we had learned and got the whole story, it was a \u2014 it was a bad situation, unhappy. Somebody, an officer had determined it was necessary to have an reconnaissance patrol across the Rhine. Why, I\u2019m not sure, but there \u2014 maybe to make a record or something, but they saw a set up and A company supplied \u2014 I was not in\u2014 A company supplied a number of the men, and went off at nighttime, boats, rubber Interview with Richard Peterson * April 6, 1999 boats across the Rhine. Lieutenant Henry, who \u2014 fine, he was a good man, of the first platoon, was in charge. The patrol was probably about \u2014 I\u2019m guessing probably, I understand about 15 or 20, two boats. They got across and as reconstructed later they came back. Tell \u2014 the story came back and we were told that they got over to the other shore, dark. Apparently there was \u2014 there had been a lot of firing and there was smoke drifting back and forth. And \u2014 and what happened was \u2014 was one of those drastic, terrible things that happens in combat. The two scouts moved out ahead.

Somebody in the patrol opened fire, only to discover afterwards it was the scouts coming back, our own people. And Corny Rippons was killed, he was one of them, the other I\u2019m not sure. They tried, apparently then, to carry Corny\u2019s body back. They couldn't get it all the way back and they had to leave him over there, basically, back they came. But that was our first \u2014 one of \u2014 one of those terrible thi \u2014 I mean, you know, the matter of the so-called friendly fire. As I think General Schwarzkopf said once, once the missile leaves the barrel, it\u2019s no longer friendly. But it was a bad thing, so we \u2014 on that \u2014 on that note then, we learned about that basically. And then \u2014 then after that, the next day or so came our continuing trip on into Germany farther.

And we\u2019re going through Interview with Richard Peterson \u201c April 6, 1999 Bonn, later of course, the capitol of the west \u2014 West Germany, a ba \u2014 interesting old town. I remember from Aunt Agnes\u2019 [indecipherable] that was the birthplace of Beethoven, here are these things coming back. We wound up someth \u2014 south of Bonn and then onto a pontoon bridge to cross the Rhine. We crossed the Rhine then at a pontoon bridge. We could see to the south what were called the Drachenfels, that\u2019s part of that \u2014 tha \u2014 of the other Wagnerian business. And there were \u2014 there were \u2014 there were barrage balloons farther south. We learned later that\u2019s the point where the first bridge had been captured across the Rhine at Remagen, it\u2019s quite a way south, but we saw the balloons. Then \u2014 now by this time we were really now on the east side of the Rhine and moving deeper into Germany. We crossed several remarkably interesting roads, because they were autobahns that had built, you know, by the Reich in \u2014 and the Germans in the 1930\u2019s as \u2014 as big work projects. We crossed them. So we got the ti \u2014 we got the word autobahn right away. But farther into Germany we began seeing more signs of combat. There were destroyed tanks, American tanks and [indecipherable] tanks, too. We went through, oh I would say some 60 miles or so east, a major town called Siegen, s-i-e-g-e-n, and then we turned north up into what was called the Ruhr pocket, called that because about a week or 10 days before, two major American armored thrusts, armored divisions had moved east Interview with Richard Peterson . April 6, 1999 parallel to each other, about 60 - 70 miles apart, between them being the German Ruhr, which was the great industrial area, and 1s, actually. Dusseldorf, Duren, Essen and so forth. Then, as these two armored thrusts went east, they began to come together in out at area called Paderborn, p-a-d-e-r-b-o-r-n-e. They joined. That became within that, what was called the Ruhr pocket. Then the plan apparently was that they would \u2014 Americans, we would bring in reinforcing divisions along where those two big pincers \u2014 p-i-n-c-e-r-s had come together. The divisions would then, on the south side turn to the north, on the north side turn to the south and gradually converge to come together to eliminate the pocket. We were one of those divisions. Other divisions were the 78\", the men of the eighth division, I\u2019Il come back that, that we had re-reinforced \u2014 replaced, they come into the pocket. The 97\" division was there, on the south side. We were taken to a small town called Zimmersbach(ph) z-i-m-e-r-s-b-a-c-h \u2014 z-i-m-m-e-r-b-a-c-h. Small, tiny, tiny town. We were billeted in a house, a great, huge manure pile out in front, typically of \u2014 of a \u2014 of a\u2014 of a German peasant area. A comfortable house, so we \u2014 we \u2014 it was good because we \u2014 the guys could find eggs and we fried eggs and so we were there a matter of two or three days getting final togetherness and getting things ready. I remember nearby, it was a Sunday, we attended church, and one of the medics we had was a \u2014 a very accomplished Interview with Richard Peterson \u201c\u00b0 April 6, 1999 organist who played the German organ there. I remember seeing in the front cemetery of the church there was some \u2014 some \u2014 some graves which had been obviously German soldiers buried there, I mean they [indecipherable] where they were buried. Then \u2014 then we left that area, April eighth of 1945, we were taken by our six by sixes 1n the final \u2014 the final stretch \u2014 or we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re hiking, we\u2019re \u2014 we are on foot, into a wooded area, because we\u2019re getting ready to take off, as we say, if we jump off in the attack the next day. So we\u2019re rowt \u2014 right up \u2014 right practically at the front. And spent the night there in bivouac, not tents, we just s- slept outside, basically. And then early the next morning we \u2014 we jumped off in the attack. That would have been April ninth now, of 1945. To the north \u2014 nor- northwest actually, into the pocket. Then, next several days, our first major incursion into the area, the area was called Sauerland, s-a-u-e-r-l-a-n-d. Sauerland, one word, I-a-n-d, because apparently the soil was \u2014 was \u2014 of all strange things to know \u2014 but it was very rugged country, wooded. I-I-In the infantry we say, excellent defensive terrain for the defender, huh. We moved through it. Not much was happening, however. The Germans were pulling back, there was some occasional firefights there, not much. And I remember several times there, we \u2014 we did experience German mortars coming in as they were defending, but not \u2014 not a great deal. It was a fast push, because we would be on Interview with Richard Peterson \" April 6, 1999 the way most of the time. We \u2014 at nighttime we\u2019d grab a few hours sleep if we could, maybe in a \u2014 1n a\u20141n a\u2014I remember sleeping one night on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the kitchen floor. Another night we were \u2014 and that was lucky, we were in a barn, and they had some straw. But pretty much we were pushing. And that would have been Monday we jumped off, Tuesday that way. And then it was on Wednesday, which was April 11 when we began \u2014 I si\u2014 remember seeing a sign in gothic print, Attendorn, a-t-t-e-n-d-o-r-n, three k-ms ahead. And that was when we began really approaching Attendorn and that\u2019s \u2014 that was our first major combat."

            "question": "And you \u2014",
            "answer": "We were on the reverse, or south side of a hill, in strength, meaning we were \u2014 we were \u2014 we were actually well reinforced, the whole thing. We \u2014 A company at that time was the \u2014 was in the lead. To explain, I am the lead. Normally in a battalion, if the battalion, for example is committed, two companies would be side by side, the third in reserve. And the same with two bi \u2014 there might be two ba \u2014 battalions there, and the third in reserve. At that time A company then, we \u2014 we were leading in the attack into this town called Attendorn. And the result was, up the hillside, I remember then around the c \u2014 as we made the curve on a roadway and began working through the trees, we looked across and there was a treeburst Interview with Richard Peterson . April 6, 1999 on the distant hill. Let me explain treeburst. Artillery shells are so constructed, either number one, they\u2019re solid shells, or secondly explosive shells. Explosive shells are ones that have a very sensitive tip on the end. And the minute that even touches any object, even a twig, it would explode. Very sen \u2014 and in a fa \u2014 in an artillery barrage, if the barrage is going into wooded area, as it would hit the trees, it\u2019d break and that\u2019s called a treeburst. Very, very dangerous because of the \u2014 the shell \u2014 shrapnel just spins right down. That was at a distance though, but \u2014 I\u2019m speaking to you. Then we came around the top of the hill and then ahead of us, red tile roof and so on, was this very sizable town, which was Attendorn. We came up through \u2014 I si \u2014 the company, I mean basically, I remember we\u2019re coming past some of the units of our cannon company, the cannon company and \u2014 the cannon company is a large, self propelled, it\u2019s a one-oh-five. Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) of our company at that particular time, was our assistant company commander, but he also has some direction and control over the fourth platoon, the weapons platoon, he was helping on that too. Weapons platoon then began setting up machine gun for so-called covering fire because then we got the order and our platoon, third platoon began going down a rather steep hill on the run, on the double, rifles up well, ther-there ha \u2014 we call porter, to attack the town. And then we began getting a lot of fire from the Germans 88s. We learned afterwards that Interview with Richard Peterson \" April 6, 1999 the entire Ruhr was so much attacked by allied aircraft that they had a tremendous amount, the Germans, of anti-aircraft material. 88s and 20-20s. When there were no longer these air attacks because the stage the war, they would simply level those and use against the aca \u2014 ca\u2014 oncoming Americans. So we had a lot of \u2014 a lot of 88s coming in, artillery. There was a 20 millimeter ak-ak, and as we started down the hill, 3\" platoon began taking casualties. We had a sergeant who was killed, our lieutenant was injured. Several others were injured down the late \u2014 way, too, basically. This was, as I said, our first real experience of combat. And it\u2019s a strange thing. You\u2019re there, it\u2019s happening to you, and yet fortunately, because of the discipline you\u2019ve had, you \u2014 you\u2019re scared, right down in the pit of your stomach, but \u2014 but y-y-you do it, you go on. Then into this house right nearby \u2014 I sa \u2014I say, then, a number of us. And then Dave Sargent(ph) \u2014 Sergeant Dave, a sergeant, I remember, was outside, he said okay, because then the next thing we had to do out of the house, Dave directed us down the hill, we went on down the hill to cross a river, a small stream, waist high. Cold, though. Up the other side basically and I\u2014 I\u2014I\u2019d had \u2014 I forgot, basically, but my sergeant says, Pete, you\u2019re the first one across. So I crossed the river, up onto the other side, cold, rifles held high to keep them dry, and there was sniper fire coming in over the railroad. Then across the railroad, we got across okay, but you get \u2014 for the first Interview with Richard Peterson * April 6, 1999 time you\u2019re getting some vicious snapping \u2014 you know, th-the \u2014 or sniping, around. Then it seems that the Germans must have pulled out. We learned however, later on, that one of our men, fourth platoon was asked and did, because he had good German, go in with a white flag and their at \u2014 their \u2014 see if they surrender. The company man who thought they might. They wouldn\u2019t. The name was Bob Oelke, o-e-I-k-e. The Germans ignored the white flag, grabbed him, tossed him in the cellar. With presence of mind he went into the next room, because they tossed in some grenades after him, he was alright, he later escaped. But that we learned later. Into the town and then we began moving through. We, meaning the third platoon, we were still there. Now, at that time, as we moved along, by this time it\u2019s probably three, four in the afternoon. Cobblestone streets, rifles on the ready, covering each other. This is called a mopping up operation. But the Germans seemed to have pulled out \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t remember anything more at that time. And it was then, as we were going up this cobblestone street [indecipherable] that we approached a factory area. Obviously there was some \u2014 and then behind this barbed wire fence were these people, unkempt, dirty, emaciated and Mac \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, MacGilvery(ph), in charge, I was behind him, went up and opened the gate. Now, at this point I must explain that for some reason, for some reason, I do not personally recall Mac opening the gate, but I Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 have talked to him, I say Mac is Sergeant MacGilvery(ph) of Dallas, Texas. He \u2014 he had detail \u2014 details I'd forgotten. Strange about memory, some things you \u2014 but Mac is very explicit that he\u2019d opened the gate. The people were in there. They realized apparently we\u2019re Americans, uniforms ra \u2014 they began crowding out and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and trying to embrace us, and \u2014 and \u2014 and kiss us apparently. I don\u2019t recall that. But one thing that was pervasive apparently, and this was confirmed by \u2014 by sar \u2014 Dave Sargent, there at the time, sergeant and later on by Lieutenant \u2014 then Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg(ph), horrible, heavy, heavy stench and odor. Again, I \u2014 this I didn\u2019t recall and I\u2019m surprised because I\u2019m normally pretty aware of olfactory things. But 1t was there, amb \u2014 obviously. What I do recall though now, very clearly, myself. We had gone into a nearby building, because Mac\u2019s determination was we gotta \u2014 gotta watch out for whate \u2014 there might be krauts around. Kraut being the derogative name for German. There might be krauts here, they gotta check it out. And I remember stepping into the building now, and I think it \u2014 it was a large room, maybe 50 by 50 or so. And I do remember there were \u2014 there were some bodies lying around and I remember Mac started to walk over across the room. Now, 1n his detail, Sergeant MacGilvery(ph), Mac said that there was a skull that he recognized, it \u2014 he \u2014 he\u2019s from Texas. It was horse\u2019s skeleton. And walked over. This I remember too, beca Interview with Richard Peterson ~ April 6, 1999 \u2014 he walked over and there was an old \u2014 to me appeared to be an old woman, crouched down, holding something. And \u2014 and Mac was over there, paused for a moment, came back, fury in his eyes and said, now I\u2019m being explicit. Those goddamn fucking krauts, look how they treat these poor sons of bitches. The lady is scraping out that horse\u2019s skull for food and eating it. Gee, well. He also said, forget about the goddamn horse, they\u2019ve scraped all the meat off that too. There was a heavy \u2014 I remember it now, this at \u2014 there was a heavy odor and \u2014 and we walked past and \u2014 and there was a body. I\u2019m not sure dead or alive, but \u2014 but \u2014 but Mac pointed out the face and he \u2014 he \u2014 look at that poor son of a bitch\u2019s legs, they were \u2014 they were apparently gangrenous and this heavy odor must have been putrid-putri-putrefaction, I\u2019m guessing. Back out into the street, fresh air thank God, because all the other \u2014 and on back out and I remember we got back out in the street and as our patrol got back out there, somebody behind me was throwing up, one of our guys be \u2014 just \u2014 just the impact of it. And Mac said, and I did remember this, that a lot of \u2014 they were laborers mostly, whatever, you know [indecipherable] people were out in the street, they just kind of wandered out, the gate was open. A \u2014 an officer came along and advised that we had to get them back inside because they needed attention, whatever. And they could not be wandering the street by themselves, so somehow, and I don\u2019t recall, they must Interview with Richard Peterson ~ April 6, 1999 have been herded back in, because after that then we \u2014 we moved ahead and we were on our way after that."

And \u2014 and \u2014 and this was just one other part of it, and \u2014 and it did not really assume any great importance until a more recent time, when we realize now, seeing what was happening elsewhere in Germany, the scenes we\u2019ve seen of the death camps. Now, there were \u2014 I\u2019m told \u2014 historians \u2014 a good friend who\u2019s an historian says that there were no death camps up in the Ruhr.

I suppose the \u2014 the passage of years puts a \u2014 puts a different complexion on it. I know that \u2014 that as far as other parts of combat, guys were killed, we recognized it, accepted it. And I realized, it wasn\u2019t until maybe after getting home, the 30 day span of time, it really began to come back of what we had been through and seen.

My sergeant \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 well, not \u2014 not Mac, he was fine, but my own squad sergeant, we got through Attendorn, if this is a part of what you want, we were talking about, we got through Attendorn to the other side, came back on the same railroad again, dropped down to take a few minutes break basically, and then Sergeant Markson(ph) from Iowa, good chap, and my own sergeant, George Evans just flopped down. George was ashen. He said, I can\u2019t take this shit, he says, I\u2014 I can\u2019t do it. Bud came down pretty \u2014 he said, George, God damnit, you got the stripes, this is our job.

            "question": "This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Richard Peterson. This is tape number two, side B. And you were talking about your reaction to the \u2014 that day and night.",
            "answer": "A-As commented, I think \u2014 I think that at the time there is a \u2014 there \u2014 there 1s an insulation, I suppose, that is given you by your \u2014 your discipline that you have, to a degree. Other things become so drastic that you \u2014 something I suppose, maybe mentally helps block them out. To get through them you have to. Maybe, as I suggested, it was only after getting back in a peacetime setting like the \u2014 our har \u2014 our months furlough. And I remember it happened when I was home, after we\u2019d gotten back from Europe, th-the month between, we went back several times, I ca \u2014 I kind of \u2014 and I-I-I know that the death of a couple guys swept back. George, Frank\u2019s did, some others we had then too, the \u2014 just the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the immensity of it. After those experiences, you\u2019re do \u2014 you do have dreams and nightmares. I had \u2014 it\u2019s diminished greatly over the years, but after first getting out of the service, an-and let me just finish perhaps by the German experience, we had that then. Then we also had some more drastic experience. We were the second company, the second American company in the whole army to cross the Danube farther south. A company from the 103\" division to the southwest, crossed in the morning of the 26\", and we crossed the night of the 26\", so by \u2014 by an English Interview with Richard Peterson \u00b0* April 6, 1999 [indecipherable]. And we lost a number of people there, and a lot of \u2014 quite a few wounded. Some wounded. But it\u2019s after then as I discovered, getting back over there, I would have occasional dreams that would be quite frightening. I\u2019d wake. They\u2019ve diminished. And yet even now I do have a recurrent dream which is that \u2014 either \u2014 I\u2019m either going to be going into the army again, or I\u2019m in the army again. And I find that I have a feeling of concern, of fear, if you please. And terribly glad to wake up to realize that it is not happening again. That 1 \u2014 that has come sometimes. The most drastic thing recently was to have seen the movie \u201cSaving Private Ryan.\u201d Now, I\u2019ve talked to my company \u2014 Captain Greenburg(ph), he\u2019s seen it too. Every \u2014 every combat veteran I\u2019ve talked to has had a similar experience, some more, some less, but I remember, to see it, the first oh, five minutes is in the cemetery, but then \u2014 then you begin \u2014 then one begins seeing the beginning of D-Day with the small craft, the landing craft coming in. Now, we were not D-Day of course, but we did have the training in amphibious. And it was a remarkable thing because as I watched that in the darkened theater \u2014 my sa \u2014 Pat wa \u2014 wife Pat did not go. As I watched that and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and the camera, for those who will see it recall that you saw the boats from the side and then that moved over and panned right into the boat itself, and you\u2019re looking at the men. Hanks, the captain and the ca \u2014 played the part of the captain. I was there again. It Interview with Richard Peterson \u201c April 6, 1999 was like it was our platoon going in. The \u2014 the roar of the motors, the spray of the spray coming over the top. Guys being \u2014 throwing up around you. The gear all just the same, basically. And I began to cry, just this weeps and then when, in the picture, the craft hit the shore, the ramp went down, typical training, and then the German artillery, the mortars opened up, machine gunning the whole \u2014 I found myself audibly crying, I couldn\u2019t help it. And I\u2014 ve \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014I have a free sample, Captain Greenburg(ph) who you [indecipherable] have met said he had the same experience. That he \u2014 he had that happen. He \u2014 he w \u2014 he was weeping. And to drop back to our experience, the lieutenant who had taken the platoon across the Rhine that I spoke of earlier, who had both the command responsibility of that group, a terrible burden to take back. After our first reunion of our company, he attended, it was back in \u2014 okay, it was Council Bluffs, my home. We had them there in 90 \u2014 \u201995 and 97. In \u201995 for the first time, cap \u2014 Lieutenant Henry came. Now a doctor in Dallas, a \u2014 a very, very fine, but rather sensitive. And we visit a lot and he talked about that experience, the patrol across the Rhine. I had for Lieutenant Henry, after he got back home, a very gracious letter thanking us for \u2014 my wife and I. But he went on to say, the value it was to him to visit with comrades-in-arms of years ago, to just hear about, that \u2014 that it \u2014 he understood things better and that it relieved from his should \u2014 from his shoulders Interview with Richard Peterson \u201c April 6, 1999 the burden of guilt that he\u2019d felt all these years. One good thing about reunions, they helped. I talked to him, we were at ak \u2014 our division reunion in newy \u2014 Louisville last September and he\u2019d seen the movie and he said it \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t have, he said, it put me back again. So I think seeing the par \u2014 again, after all these years, it comes back. And you wonder \u2014 what little I read of psychology on it, they \u2014 we\u2019re told in psychology that \u2014 that these memories are latent, that certain things can trigger them off. Example, the \u2014 the \u2014 the smell, the odor. I can stand on a street corner today, pass those \u2014 a diesel bus and the diesel fumes take me right back to our training days when the \u2014 the diesel of the outfit. And yet on the other hand, come back to it, I don\u2019t remember anything about the terrible stench at Attendorn. Strange. And I don\u2019t know. My one thought, it might be that \u2014 who can tell about these things? It may have been a reaction to what \u2014 that night, later on when we were close to death, or the others were close to death and sa \u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know. I-I \u2014 I-I do not have the wisdom to answer that."

On the roads, moving, traveling, wherever they might be going. At the city, the town of Eichstatt, different because our company commander Captain Mitchell was ill, and then Lieutenant not Captain Greenburg(ph), then age 22 took over the company, and he had the responsibility of 200 men there were [indecipherable]. And we had \u2014 we had it \u2014 a\u2014 a bad time at Ingolstadt \u2014 I take it back, at Eichstatt. Got \u2014 got quite a bit of \u2014 of resistance there. Then on down towards the major city of Ingolstadt, which we were told was the hometown of Heinrich Himmler, expect defense. Well, it \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if it was with Himmler or not, but there was a \u2014 going into Ingolstadt was not the bad, but that\u2019s the night we crossed the Danube. There was resistance there and that was a Interview with Richard Peterson *\" April 6, 1999 \u2014a pretty drastic night, to get in and get across basically, cross the river. As I said, we were th \u2014 we were the \u2014 we were the second company of the Americans to go cro \u2014 I mean, a \u2014 the whole American army to cross, apparently. We got a counterattack that night, got some \u2014 oh, we had a number who were killed, two or three killed, I think, and quite a few wounded. And that\u2019s one of the nights one realizes how thin is the veneer of civilization, by which I mean this. I remember that I was the \u2014 I was the platoon runner by that time, sort of ran messages between the company command posts, CP and our \u2014 where we were, some \u2014 oh, some blocks away. In the black of the night the Germans had come in, and the ka \u2014 and then several were wounded. And I remember going past and this \u2014 this German was crying, he says, I am bless\u00e9, well, French for woun \u2014 well, be \u2014 any \u2014 and I remember I \u2014 I said \u2014 I just \u2014 I said, [speaks German] shut up. I mean, I \u2014 no compassion at all on my part, huh? Yeah, I mean, you know, just \u2014 that was it. And you realize that yeah, I suppose that\u2019s our training and to \u2014 basically we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t take a chance, that kind of a thing. Maybe he was \u2014 maybe he was just a \u2014 faking it, who knows? I couldn\u2019t take a chance. That was Ingolstadt and then we were there brief, and then after that really, the war was really finish up because by that time we were just on the move in \u2014 in \u2014 or sometimes \u2014 sometimes we were riding tanks and going out ahead, other times mostly in trucks. Interview with Richard Peterson \u201c\u00b0 April 6, 1999 Then, within a matter of a week we were down in Austria, we crossed into Austria. We \u2014 we stopped, oh we were pro \u2014 at a small town called Perwang, which 1s about 20 \u2014 p-e \u2014 p-e-r-w-a-n-g, about 20 kilometers north of Salzburg, we were in Austria. And there \u2014 we were there when the word that the \u2014 it was May seventh or May eighth, take your choice, the war was over. And immediately rumors began coming, okay you guys, you\u2019re already \u2014 there \u2014 you\u2019re going to the Pacific. My God. Well, the thought was bad, but in the meantime we realized we were gonna have some time at home. So indeed that\u2019s what happened. We came back by truck back to Mannheim. We were there in Mannheim for a time, probably just a few days only in Feudenheim then truck again back across France to the same tents we were 1n when we first came, in Old Gold. And then \u2014 then we got new uniforms, got the combat jackets. Pretty spiffy stuff, we thought. And now getting ready for home. Trucks down to LaHavre. I was mentioning to Captain Greenburg(ph) when we talked today, as we were leaving LaHavre now, some romantic soul put on the loudspeaker system Debussy\u2019s Clair de Lune. That was a nice departure. A week back to cross the Atlantic and then came this tumultuous arrival at home, because we were the first division back from Europe and we had the grand welcome. Blimps in the sky, fireboats in the \u2014 in New York harbor. Great big, huge banner across a hill, well done, welcome home. And off \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Richard Peterson -\" April 6, 1999 off the ships. Our ship had on a great big panel, ETO to Tokyo. Well. But we got in and my captain, Captain Reed(ph), we were still [indecipherable] tell me that he \u2014 his home was Hoboken. His parents had learned of our return and his father was able to get around over to the Manhattan\u2019s ri \u2014 we \u2014 I think he s \u2014 I the captain said pier 77 or something. 57. Got off and his father was right out there. Father shoved and pushed, he \u2014 right past and he bay \u2014 they kissed. Marvelous, huh. And even the rest of us, it \u2014 1t was tremendous to come back, our own country again. Amazingly \u2014 I have it here, but amazingly there were \u2014 we had dignitaries and well wishers, but a lot of media. Reporter \u2014 a reporter from the \u201cDes Moines Register\u201d was there and we had a great big feature, which I still saved at home basically, the \u2014 the Blackhawks back again and they had the \u2014 the name of every Iowan who was coming back and \u2014 and so there were many, many happy families. We knew from the Register at home they knew we\u2019d been in combat, that\u2019s the first word, because that had a little feature, what they\u2019ve done. And they had in the Register, toward the end of April that the 86\" was in combat. Course, folks were just terribly tied up, terribly tied up. An amazing thing happened, a tragic thing. When I \u2014 we got back to Mannheim, got our mail for the first ttme. My mother had written that she met a good high school friend of hers of Council Bluffs, now in Omaha, they got talking and her son was in the 86\", Interview with Richard Peterson \u201d April 6, 1999 [indecipherable] together, his name was \u2014 was Captain Bruce McAllister, of our K company [indecipherable] in our regiment. And I remember as clearly sitting as we\u2019re sitting here. I remember saying to one of our \u2014 I said, my gosh, Wes, I \u2014 I\u2019ve got to look up this Captain McAllister. He says, Pete, you\u2019re too late. He was killed two weeks ago, down on the \u2014 on the [indecipherable] down the Danube. So those things happen. That was \u2014 now \u2014"

But to all of us, to all of us, we can go back, and in our experience, in this \u2014 in the world in which we live, the \u2014 the \u2014 1-in my terms, the crucible of contra \u2014 of combat, you can see and remember the expression a certain fellow had, one of your \u2014 one of your G.I. buddies on the street corner at a certain time. You can \u2014 you can see or visualize a hillside, or a certain setting where you were and what was happening at the time.

I have here our division history. And as I read it through there are many areas \u2014 history is hard \u2014 is hard to recover accurately and I find many things that I \u2014 I ca \u2014 I describe as being garbled in this. It depends who one talks to, it depends how it\u2019s reconstructed, and it \u2014 wh-while there\u2019s a lot of good work, at the same time there are things that do come off wrong.

An-And th-there is no solution to that, no answer. I-I think maybe the religious faith, you know, faith in God, of course, in the hereafter if we\u2019re going to accept that, is important. S \u2014 but apropos of the matter of \u2014 of how to reason it out, it ca \u2014 it cannot be reasoned out.

You \u2014 you want to deny it to yourself, and yet contradictorily it\u2019s still there. Strange. Not often, but \u2014 but more often it \u2014 more often 1s a \u2014 come \u2014 comes the feeling of \u2014 of the futility of 1t and the \u2014 and th \u2014 and the \u2014 I remem- member coming home in my furlough and \u2014 and during that time, I remember we lost some of these guys, tha-that \u2014 that brought me to tears.

Didn\u2019t think at the time, but after the pass of years you wonder about it, basically. Interestingly also, I did some checking out \u2014 I had occasion to read \u2014 check back in to the records of the Nuremberg \u2014 Nuremberg. November, it began. One of the major cases was that of a Field Marshal Milch m-i-n-l \u2014 m-i-l-c-h, Milch, who was a subordinate of Albert Speer, and that was the [indecipherable]. He was one was responsible for the \u2014 the so-called forced labor, alright? And in the exhibits presented at Nuremberg in his behalf were requirements by the Reich supposedly that these people would be adequately fed and cared for. Not humanitarianly-wise, but to insure the fact they could do the work they were going to do, huh. The other was \u2014 simply seemed secondary, basically. And of course in the case of these poor people, in ha \u2014 admittedly now, probably the logistical system had broken down, I mean as far as food, but that does not still explain in a \u2014 in any way excuse the way they were being held. Read, as we have, Manchester\u2019s book, \u201cThe Arms of Krupp,\u201d and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and th-the treatment to which the Kruppianer subjected all their force people, huh. It\u2019s an incredible thing, incredible living in it. And \u2014 and what we saw that afternoon, I mean, the way these that \u2014 the way these people were.

            "answer": "Well, it\u2019s quite inters \u2014 it\u2019s quite interesting. Number one, there had been a great \u2014 a great tradition, history of tolerance in Denmark. Smaller countries [indecipherable] also. But early enlightenment, which began in Denmark in the 1820\u2019s - 30\u2019s, they had \u2014 they had left the monarchy, I mean the \u2014 the actual absolute monarchy and into more of a constitutional monarchy, th-that helped. A smaller country, as I mentioned again, and beyond that, I\u2019m not sure, except that there was \u2014 it was indeed a safe haven. Now, as to how the wonderful escape took place in October, several things I \u2014 I read \u2014 as we read it. Number one, there had been the great feeling of the Danish people. The-The-These are not Danish Jews, Interview with Richard Peterson \u00b0 April 6, 1999 it\u2019s Jewish Danes. A subtle distinction, but it\u2019s interesting. Secondly the war situation was turning against Germany. Allies were in north Africa by that time. Stalingrad had been completed. The general feeling was \u2014 was different. The proximity \u2014 the proximity of Sweden now, made it possible, which might, in a landlocked country not have happened, huh. And the willingness of the Swedes to accept it. There\u2019s a wonderful story told apropos of that, about the Swedish side of it now. When the time came that was realized the Germans were going to move, to take the Danish Jews, time was short. It was a matter of days, but they had to somehow \u2014 they meaning the Danish people under their leadership and the resistance get them out. But they had to have the agreement of Sweden to take them. They could not deal with Germany and say \u2014 because that would tip it off. So what was determined, from what I read, was this, they realized that the Danish leadership, they had to get the agreement of the Swedish crown. The arrangement was made that they, the Danish people would select, hopefully, that \u2014 a leader of the Danish Jewish community to hopefully visit with the King of Sweden. It was arranged. And the person selected was Niels Bohr, the great atomic [indecipherable]. The story goes on to say that in \u2014 1n Bohr\u2019s words he said \u2014 he said, I\u2019m a scientist, not an advocate, he said, why \u2014 well, they said you have th- the standing, the name, the King will \u2014 all right. It was arranged remarkably Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Richard Peterson \"\u00b0 April 6, 1999 [indecipherable]. Then, in just a matter of hours they set this up and apparently then, either \u2014 either by boat \u2014 they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re still \u2014 they\u2019re c-careful, or possibly by a British aircraft, the Mosquito coming, take him over, Bohr was taken to Stockholm, to probably Drottningholm and the palace, the story is told. He said, in I went, to this massive palace. Re-Realized what was on my shoulders to try and get this done, to persuade the king. I was shown into the room. Had a room and th-th-th-the king\u2019s attendant was there, basically very fine, he said Dr. Bohr, please wait. Then he said the moment came, he said [indecipherable] here \u2014 here \u2014 here I am just becoming more tense by the moment. The door opened and they said, Dr. Bohr, the king will see you now. He said, I stepped in and here was this very pleasant looking gentleman, it was the king, King Gustav. Gustav Aroff(ph) I think it was. And he said, I-I have some Swedish. And he said, I explained in [indecipherable] as best I could the plight of our people, what was going to happen and \u2014 and that we desperately pled for help. He said, the king, very courteous, stood up. He said, of course I stood up too. The king walked to the window, looked out. He said that \u2014 I can [indecipherable] it was probably all of maybe 10 seconds, but he came back and said, Dr. Bohr, your people will be welcome in Sweden. And that was it, laid the foundation. So, a combination of things put together, you see, and of course the \u2014 it was not all \u2014 I Interview with Richard Peterson \"t April 6, 1999 mean there were \u2014 there were some problems to getting them \u2014 getting the Danes across or getting the \u2014 the \u2014 the Jews across, the Jewish people. Some \u2014 some boat people did charge, others did not, back and forth, but it still was a remarkable, remarkable thing, huh? Incredible."
