I think beyond that also Mother and Dad encouraged collections of Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 4things. Stamp collections, that sort of thing basically that was of interest. Music was always a part of our home. Mother sang beautifully and she played the piano, we had that sort of thing. Interestingly too at home, I think th ough, we had quite a bit \u0152 because on my father\u2122s side, Danish background, as the name indicates. On my mother\u2122s side the family went way back from New England Yankee people. So on Dad\u2122s side we would have my grandparents who lived just a block away, we\u2122d be often times in their home. We learned little bit of Danish, used some Danish in the home place, and my father had not spoken Englis h until he was five. On Mother\u2122s side we had a lot of Ci vil War background because she had three uncles who were in the Civil War. We had a lot of Civil War songs and a lot of that sort of thing basically. So there was a kind of a developing interest of history as well too, during that time."

Mother \u0152 Mother had more expression I think basically and she enjoyed things more. She was a \u0152 a \u0152 a delightfully humorous person, a lot of fun to be around. Dad, as I say, was more Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 6serious, but he was a very, very, very fine person. And looking back, too, in the home, as I said, it was a lot of encouragement of reading and a lot of encouragement of motivation to do things. Dad was very active community-wise and he urged all of us to \u0152 to be involved in high school activities, other activities as well. An interesting thing about the family, though, you see, we\u2122re almost rather like two families. My \u0152 in the sense that my sister was 11 years older, my brother nine, and I, as Mother said, the side dish that came on orders was that much younger, you see. So I \u0152 they were up and growing, my \u0152 my sister Josephine, brother Robert, they were kind of on a different level by the time I was \u0152 I came along. So I was home quite a bit myself, in those later years."

Quite unusual at that particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had both been in Europe. My Aunt Agnes had \u0152 had been in Germany a number of times and studied there. Aunt Belle had been with her al so. But we would have, when Aunt Belle and Aunt \u0152 Aunt Agnes were there, talks about Europe and visiting about Europe . So really as younger people we were aware of at least Europe. Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly. And I\u2122m speaking now Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 7of \u0152 of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of Europe.

We had radio news basically as well, too. So I think proba bly as \u0152 as things were beginning to develop, I remember discussions of the Sp anish Civil War, that would be what, in the late 1930\u2122s.

But it was in April, the next April, when Germany moved into first Denmark and then the Scandinavian countries, and that was very \u0152 very meaningful because I remember so well of going over that morning to Grandma and Grandpa\u2122s, they\u2122re still living. This time they were in \u0152 in the 80\u2122s. But I can picture just as we talk right now, Grandpa Peterson sitting there in the sun in the early morning as if he were stunned. The war did come. And I said in Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 9Danish, Bedstefar [Danish]. Yeah, da \u0152 I\u2122ll put it sa \u0152 put it in Danish again. [Speaks Danish here] The Germans have Denmark . And then in English he says, poor little Denmark, she couldn\u2122t do a thing. She coul dn\u2122t do a thing. And he just \u0152 he\u2122d been in the German army, you se \u0152 oh, I\u2122m sorry, the \u0152 the Danish army. And of course it was a great history in the 1860\u2122s when Grandpa was in Denmark growing up, of the first \u0152 you know, th-the first war with Germany. And then of course the World War II is \u0152 World War \u0152 war was there also, but this was a really traumatic thing for them.

At this time, age 16, realized that not fully as yet, but it was going to affect us. The next morning in the \ufb01Des Moines Register\ufb02 there appeared a \u0152 a \u0152 the name was Ding Darling, he was one of the leading cartoonists in the country, and here was this \u0152 this drawing. It was of Uncle Sam kneeling, holding in his arms a sailor with a knife in his back. And Uncle Sam was looking up in fury and anger, shaking his fist at the departing Japane se aircraft. Powerful thing. I remem-mem-member very well, and that\u2122s one of the first times I ever remember seeing Dad in tears, at that. And that was now Monday morning at home. At school, Abraham Lincoln High School, our principal Mr. Kern, Gerald Kern, a \u0152 a very fine educator and he ran a tight school. He called the entire school body together, we were in the \u0152 the big, large auditorium. He perceived in his wisdom how he\u2122ll be affecting us, and he had brought \u0152 he br ought in a large floor model radio which was up on the stage. And I can see him ye t. The auditorium, large but couldn\u2122t take all of them, so there were other students in the aisles, the balcony, the whole thing. And we sat there in dead silence, and Mr. Kern turned on President Roosevelt\u2122s war message. And how interesting. I thought about it over the years. Over \u0152 over the \u0152 the \u0152 the stage, on the proscenium of the stage, in large gothic Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 13letters in high school were, ye come to learn, go forth to serve. How rather prophetic looking back, huh, at those times. That was Monday and then of course during the week, difficult. To drop back a bit though, the week before had been a tense week because I remember th-the \u0152 the \u0152 the [indecipherable] this country as we recall, as the special en \u0152 envoys, emissaries and there were big pictures of them in the paper, them smiling and very \u0152 you know. And then came the word about it. But I remember wh en, during the end of the week as we\u2122re reaching \u0152 it would have been in probably De cember fourth or fifth \u0152 thir d, fourth or fifth, that the word came that they were re-reaching so me kind of an accord, they thought \u0152 I remember saying to Dad, Dad, how lucky \u0152 a war with Japan would be terrible, wouldn\u2122t it?

            "answer": "To a degree, but it was changing, beca use we realized things were indeed happening, and they already had, to th is extent. The National Guard had been already brought into federal service by that time. I thi \u0152 I think that our local unit, which was the 168 th infantry of the na \u0152 34th division had been mustered in in January the year before. And we were aware of it because a number of the high school student seniors were in the National Guard and they were gone. And I Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 14remember then, it was in the \u0152 May of that year, which would have been 1941, before the war, but here they made arrangements and I remember being in \u0152 I was in the band and orchestra, and it was al ways typical that we would play, the orchestra, we would play \u0152 our \u0152 our school march was \ufb01The Pilgrim\u2122s Chorus\ufb02 from Tannh\u00e4user . And \u0152 and Mr. Kern liked it, it was very good. Much better than \ufb01Pomp and Circumstance.\ufb02 But I remember being th \u0152 we were practicing and in came the high school seniors and I remember I was so, as a youngster, moved, because here were four, five or six of the high school students now on active duty, they were there in uniform, they came back to graduate. So that was \u0152 so we were very much aware of it. And to drop back to your other question, how did it change? We were much aware, the \u0152 the high school paper, \ufb01 The Echoes\ufb02 began having items more and more of clas smates we had, or students who were now in the service, in the military, back and forth. As well, at our high school we had ROTC, junior ROTC, we were all in it, even band \u0152 band people had a military band and the whole thing. So there was more emphasis all the time. I mean that things are going to happen, young people and you\u2122ve got training that\u2122s going on here, it\u2122s going to be helpful to you. So the \u0152 the high school paper as I said, was carrying more and more news about people who graduated, and where they were training and so forth, so we\u2122re very much aware of it. And, may I add, Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 15the school activities began to be directed . Junior Red Cross, for example, was having more projects. As \u0152 as youngsters , I was involved with the Boy Scouts, the Boy Scout project even at that time was collecting aluminum, s-scrap aluminum to get for the war effort.

Some of our class, for example had already done \u0152 signed up for submarine officer tr aining and so forth, some for the air force. I did not. I went to Drake University in June, just after graduation for about \u0152 it was about a month, six weeks. Drake, because it had been Dad\u2122s school, it was a good school in Des Moines , and Dad\u2122s thought was, get as much education as you can before the military, which was exactly right. And then, after about six weeks there, I got word that I would be eligible for the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program, ASTRP. Reserve being for those who had not yet attained age 18 and you could go into the enlisted reserve, start off. And then, after finishing one\u2122s first term, and when you reached your 18th birthday or past it, then that term would stop in school, you would be s \u0152 be \u0152 you would be come a part of the army itself, be sworn in, have y our basic training, then the program would come back to school afterwards. All right, to drop back now, my particular group that I qualified for, we were \u0152 I was still in Des Moines, Drake University. Down, I remember going downtown at the directi on, and I had all the papers and so forth, I \u0152 in \u0152 Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 20went into the enlisted reserve, took the oath basically and so forth. And then terminated my work at Drake, went home and oh then two or three weeks afterwards reported to then Fort Crook for induction into the actual \u0152 the actual service itself. Our group went to Kansas University at Lawrence, Kansas. And we began our first tour of ASTRP, all reservists, we had \u0152 we had uniforms, ROTC uniforms basically, the first part of August and we were there then with the first term of just basic engineering be ginning supposedly, until we\u2122d accomplished our 18th birthday. Mine was September 29 th, you see. So I finished the first term, and then those of us that had reached age 18 then went home for a brief furlough, we reported to Camp Dodge in Iowa, then sworn into the army itself, huh, and then began our real army experience, because after the initia l beginning in the army you have just your uniform, your shots, your medical, the whole thing, [indecipherable] orientation, then you are sent to a basic training camp.

And then the next \u0152 the next program was that we would hike out to, call it Caramouche, c-a-r-a-m-o-u-c-h-e range. It was a \u0152 oh, about a 10 mile hike. We hiked out and we had a week tha \u0152 actually I think a week on the range itself. And we had just finished \u0152 a week or 10 days \u0152 we had just finished the last exercise, which was the infiltration course, where you crawl, you know, under the \u0152 the firing machine gun bullets a nd so forth.

And it was very \u0152 a really tough growing up process because these are the folks I\u2122d come to know and so forth, that I was taken aback.

But then, the next thing that happened was this, we were just barely finishing it up, word came from Washington that the AST prog \u0152 P program was being eliminated . They needed people carrying guns, not books and the result was that not only the ASP \u0152 TP was being washed out, but also a number of Air Force cadets that had only got ten to a certain level, were also into the infantry. Result was then that we were much \u0152 a lot of turmoil what\u2122s going to happen. Mother learned about it, she was terribly upset, she wrote the congressman and so forth, as if anything could be done. But that\u2122s the way it was Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 24and so we got packed up, we had finished pretty much of our training and we were then shipped to the 86 th Blackhawk division, then training at Camp Livingston, Louisiana.

To explain a bit further, in a division, infantry, about 15,000 men, one-half of those are infantry themselves, in Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 25the form of three regiments. We were in 342nd. The Blackhawk had regiments 341st, second and third. And every regiment then would have three battalions. A battalion would be composed of a headquar ters company of the colonel, lieutenant colonel ba \u0152 of the lieutenant colonel ba sically, of the \u0152 of the battalion. The headquarters company had staff and there was a reconnaissance patrol and some other service. Then, in each \u0152 in each battalion beyond that, there were three rifle companies and a weapons company. And I \u0152 and I give this because it gives a better background for the future I think, too. A rifle company had approximately, in what was called the table of organization, TO, about 180 men commanded by, normally, a captain. And then there would be a lieutenant, who is called the platoon leader, for each of the four platoons. The \u0152 the three rifle platoons and the weapons platoon. And sometim es there would be another \u0152 another officer who is \u0152 be assistant \u0152 the assistant company commander. In our company it was Captain Mitchell, and then we had the \u0152 th-the \u0152 the f our lieutenants. Basically \u0152 trying to recall base \u0152 the names we ha d ba \u0152 there was Lieutenant Hess, Lieutenant Budman(ph), Lieutenant Greenburg(ph). And those were basically the officers that we had. Each platoon, rifle platoon was composed of three squads of 12 men each. Was the platoon sergeant, a platoon guy, like an assistant, the assistant person. And then, for each squad, the squad leader was a staff sergeant, which is Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 26the three chevrons and then the rocker underneath, an assistant squad \u0152 squad leader, who\u2122d be regular [indecipherable] and then the balance of the men will be 12 [indecipherable]. Be two scouts, two patro \u0152 two [indecipherable] of two squad scouts, a Browning automatic rifleman basica lly and other riflemen down the line, too. So therefore each \u0152 each rifle platoon had those people. In the weapons platoon. separate, those \u0152 those were the light machine guns, and there were two sections of those basically, with machine guns each and also mortars, which is 60 millimeter weapon, the tubes that fire the rockets, those thi \u0152 that would be a rifle company. There was also each ra \u0152 in each battalion, a heavy weapons company, which would be the \u0152 would be the \u0152 the \u0152 the water cooled heavy machine guns, and the 81 millimeter mortars. And so that was basically the structure of \u0152 of a regiment. And then we were A company of that, and I was in the first squad, third platoon. I was a scout, okay."

Not \u0152 not Proust , but anyway \u0152 Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 32Madame bo \u0152 however, we were about oh, eight or 10 miles north of \u0152 of Yvetot and as \u0152 right near a small French village called Normanville, n-o-r-m-a-n-v-i-l-l-e in large tents, large, large squad tents, cold and chilling. And we were located there, staging for probably 10 days, two weeks, getting ready to go up to the front. Some more equipment, some more training. As is \u0152 as a \u0152 as a squad scout I was sent with my fellow scouts up to so called mine, m-i-n-e school, up at Sassentot, s-a-s-s-e-n-t-o-t to learn about German mines. The teller, t-l-e \u0152 t-e-l-l-e-r mine, that was like a plate [indecipherable] plate. The shoe mine, that\u2122s what you have a \u0152 a variety of them. German explosives, Primacord , tetracord. Not th \u0152 we would have much, but at \u0152 we theoretically, the scouts, you see, go out in front of the squad to study the terrain and so fort h and then the squad leader in charge behind you controls your ac tions. So we had that, we were finishing that up and we got the word, okay men, fold up your tents, we\u2122re going back, we\u2122re going to be moving out, you\u2122re up tomorrow to the front. Back we went, down to Normanville and got ready to leave."

And then really, because that particular day twilight was falling, we had already gone through Maastricht, and were there stopped when there was a \u0152 a \u0152 at least a false alarm, they thought of a German, an air attack, because our an ti-aircraft guns, which were out near the \u0152 near the \u0152 near the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the train yard \u0152 railroad yards, began go \u0152 in an action getting \u0152 nothing happened, but they \u0152 we \u0152 we saw they were there.

But earlier bombardment had been so intense that the statue, the bronze statue had completely turned around. It had been facing one direction and now it Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 35was facing the other direction. [phone ringing, tape break] On the statue, which was of a bro-bronze, as near as we could tell, it\u2122s s-still dark in the morning, but there \u0152 there were \u0152 there \u0152 there were truck lights. They pointed out the fact that it had apparently originally been facing on \u0152 to \u0152 t-to the west, but the \u0152 the arterial bombardment they had had in Duren was so intense that it had just shifted, the statue was facing east. Weird, weird. So here was dark, middle of the morning, cold, chilly. We \u0152 we were \u0152 we were course in \u0152 in-in-in March now. And out of Duren we drove, heading east toward Cologne."

Then began to see a lot of bomb damage or some kind of damage to buildings, basically. A nd then we prob ably got into Cologne , I\u2122m guessing, in the con \u0152 with the truck convoy by \u0152 by seven, eight o\u2122clock in the morning, I\u2122m guessing. And that was something else. The \u0152 Cologne had been badly damaged, and yet, way up ahea d were the two huge spires of the Cologne cathedral. Some damage, but they were sta nding, they were still there. And then off \u0152 truck stopped off into the house, and then in \u0152 into houses, apartments where we were being billeted.

Then we were pulled out into trucks and dropped, taken back into a German town some distance back. Now there we did see civilians for the first time. We were moved into the house, we were supposed to be there for a day or so, something, til we\u2122re moved on Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 41farther.

This was really, now will take us into Germany itself, okay. We left that suburb o-of Cologne , but not until after we became aware of the first fatality we\u2122d had in our company. We had some injuries beca use as the Germans were dropping these shells across, one shell I recall, an 88 fell right into th \u0152 into the kitchen area and injured, didn\u2122t \u0152 not badly, some of th e cooks, shrapnel.

They got across and as reconstructed later they came back. Tell \u0152 the story came back and we were told that they got over to the other shore, dark . Apparently there was \u0152 there had been a lot of firing and there was smoke drif ting back and forth. And \u0152 and what happened was \u0152 was one of those drastic, terrible things that happens in combat. The two scouts moved out ahead.

Somebody in the patrol opened fire, only to discover afterwards it was the scouts coming back, our own people. And Corny Rippons was killed, he was one of them, the other I\u2122m not sure. They tried, apparently then, to carry Corny\u2122s body back. They couldn't get it all the way back and they had to leave him over there, basically, back they came. But that was our first \u0152 one of \u0152 one of those terrible thi \u0152 I mean, you know, the matter of the so-called friendly fire. As I think General Schwarzkopf said once, once the missile leaves the barrel, it\u2122s no longer friendly. But it was a bad thing, so we \u0152 on that \u0152 on that note then, we learned about that basically. And then \u0152 then after that, the next day or so came our continuing trip on into Germany farther. To go and pick that up, we left during the day, six by sixes again, the same trucks, parallel down through Cologne itself and then on south to Bonn. And we\u2122re going through Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 44Bonn, later of course, the capitol of the west \u0152 West Germany, a ba \u0152 interesting old town. I remember from Aunt Agnes\u2122 [indecipherable] that was the birthplace of Beethoven, here are these things coming back. We wound up someth \u0152 south of Bonn and then onto a pontoon bridge to cross the Rhine. We crossed the Rhine then at a pontoon bridge. We could se e to the south what were called the Drachenfels, that\u2122s part of that \u0152 tha \u0152 of the other Wagnerian business. And there were \u0152 there were \u0152 there were barrage balloons farther south. We learned later that\u2122s the point where the first bridge had been cap tured across the Rhine at Remagen , it\u2122s quite a way south, but we saw the balloons. Then \u0152 now by this time we were really now on the east side of the Rhine and moving deeper into Germany. We crossed several remarkably interesting roads, because they were autobahns that had built, you know, by the Reich in \u0152 and the Germans in the 1930\u2122s as \u0152 as big work projects. We cr ossed them. So we got the ti \u0152 we got the word autobahn right away. But farther into Germany we began seeing more signs of combat. There were destroyed tanks, American tanks and [indecipherable] tanks, too. We went through, oh I would say some 60 miles or so east, a major town called Siegen, s-i-e-g-e-n, and then we turned north up into what was called the Ruhr pocket, called that because about a week or 10 days before, two major American armored thrusts, armored divisions had moved east Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 45parallel to each other, about 60 - 70 miles apart, between them being the German Ruhr, which was the great industrial area, and is, actually. D\u00fcsseldorf, Duren, Essen and so forth. Then, as these two armored thrusts went east, they began to come together in out at area called Paderborn, p-a-d-e-r-b-o-r-n-e . They joined. That became within that, what was called the Ruhr pocket. Then the plan apparently was that they would \u0152 Amer icans, we would bring in reinforcing divisions along where those two big pincers \u0152 p-i-n-c-e-r-s had come together. The divisions would then, on the south side turn to the north, on the north side turn to the south and gradually converge to co me together to eliminate the pocket. We were one of those divisions. Other divisions were the 78 th, the men of the eighth division, I\u2122ll come back that, that we had re-reinforced \u0152 repla ced, they come into the pocket. The 97 th division was there, on the south side. We were taken to a small town called Zimmersbach (ph) z-i-m-e-r-s-b-a-c-h \u0152 z-i-m-m-e-r-b-a-c-h. Small, tiny, tiny town. We were billeted in a house, a great, huge manure pile out in front, typically of \u0152 of a \u0152 of a \u0152 of a German peasant area. A comfortable house, so we \u0152 we \u0152 it was good becaus e we \u0152 the guys could find eggs and we fried eggs and so we were there a ma tter of two or three days getting final togetherness and getting things ready. I remember nearby, it was a Sunday, we attended church, and one of the medics we had was a \u0152 a very accomplished Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 46organist who played the German organ there. I remember seeing in the front cemetery of the church there was some \u0152 some \u0152 some graves which had been obviously German soldiers buried there, I mean they [indecipherable] where they were buried. Then \u0152 then we left that area, April eighth of 1945, we were taken by our six by sixes in the final \u0152 the final st retch \u0152 or we\u2122re \u0152 we\u2122re hiking, we\u2122re \u0152 we are on foot, into a wooded area, because we\u2122re getting ready to take off, as we say, if we jump off in the attack the next day. So we\u2122re rowt \u0152 right up \u0152 right practically at the front. And spent the night there in bivouac, not tents, we just s-slept outside, basically. And then early the next morning we \u0152 we jumped off in the attack. That would have been April ninth now, of 1945. To the north \u0152 nornorthwest actually, into the pocket. Then, next seve ral days, our first major incursion into the area, the area was called Sauerland, s-a-u-e-r-l-a-n-d . Sauerland, one word, l-a-n-d, because apparently the soil was \u0152 was \u0152 of all strange things to know \u0152 but it was very rugged country, wooded. I-I-In the infantry we say, excellent defensive terrain for the defender, huh. We moved through it. Not much was happening, however. The Germans were pulling back, there was some occasional firefights there, not much. And I remember several times there, we \u0152 we did experience German mortars coming in as they were defending, but not \u0152 not a great deal. It was a fast push, because we would be on Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 47the way most of the time.

Another nigh t we were \u0152 and that was lucky, we were in a barn, and they had some straw. But pretty much we were pushing. And that would have been Monday we jumped off, Tuesday that way. And then it was on Wednesday, which was April 11 th when we began \u0152 I si \u0152 remember seeing a sign in gothic print, Attendorn, a-t-t-e-n-d-o-r-n, three k-ms ahead. And that was when we began really approaching Attendorn and that\u2122s \u0152 that was our first major combat."

            "answer": "We were on the reverse, or south side of a hill, in strength, meaning we were \u0152 we were \u0152 we were actually well reinforced, the whole thing. We \u0152 A company at that time was the \u0152 was in the lead. To explain, I am the lead. Normally in a battalion, if the battalion, for example is committed, two companies would be side by side, the third in reserve. And the same with two bi \u0152 there might be two ba \u0152 battalions there, and the third in reserve. At that time A company then, we \u0152 we were leading in the attack into this town called Attendorn. And the result was, up the hillside, I remember then around the c \u0152 as we made the curve on a roadway and began working through the trees , we looked across and there was a treeburst Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 48on the distant hill. Let me explain treeburst. Artillery shells are so constructed, either number one, they\u2122re solid shells, or secondly explosive shells. Explosive shells are ones that have a very sensitiv e tip on the end. And the minute that even touches any object, even a twig, it would explode. Very sen \u0152 and in a fa \u0152 in an artillery barrage, if the barrage is going into wooded area, as it would hit the trees, it\u2122d break and that\u2122s called a treeburst . Very, very dangerous because of the \u0152 the shell \u0152 shrapnel just spins right down. That was at a distance though, but \u0152 I\u2122m speaking to you. Then we came around the top of the hill and then ahead of us, red tile roof and so on, was this very sizable town, which was Attendorn. We came up through \u0152 I si \u0152 the company, I mean basically, I remember we\u2122re coming past some of the units of our cannon compa ny, the cannon company and \u0152 the cannon company is a large, self propelled, it\u2122s a one-oh-five. Lieutenant Greenburg(ph) of our company at that particular time, was our assistant company commander, but he also has some direction and contro l over the fourth platoon, the weapons platoon, he was helping on that too. Weapons platoon then began setting up machine gun for so-called covering fire because then we got the order and our platoon, third platoon began going down a rather steep hill on the run, on the double, rifles up well, ther-there ha \u0152 we call porter, to attack the town. And then we began getting a lot of fire from the Germans 88s. We learned afterwards that Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 49the entire Ruhr was so much attacked by allied aircraft that they had a tremendous amount, the Germans, of anti-aircraft mate rial. 88s and 20-20s. When there were no longer these air attacks because the stage the war, they would simply level those and use against the aca \u0152 ca \u0152 oncoming Americans. So we had a lot of \u0152 a lot of 88s coming in, artillery. There was a 20 millimeter ak-ak , and as we started down the hill, 3rd platoon began taking casualties. We had a sergeant who was killed, our lieutenant was injured. Several others were injured down the late \u0152 way, too, basically. This was, as I said, our first real experience of combat. And it\u2122s a strange thing. You\u2122re there, it\u2122s happening to you, and yet fo rtunately, because of the discipline you\u2122ve had, you \u0152 you\u2122re scared, right down in the pit of your stomach, but \u0152 but y-y-you do it, you go on. Then into th is house right nearby \u0152 I sa \u0152 I say, then, a number of us. And then Dave Sargent(ph) \u0152 Sergeant Dave, a sergeant, I remember, was outside, he said okay, because then the next thing we had to do out of the house, Dave directed us down the hill, we went on down the hill to cross a river, a small stream, waist high. Cold, though. Up the other side basically and I \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122d had \u0152 I for got, basically, but my sergeant says, Pete, you\u2122re the first one across. So I crossed the river, up onto the other side, cold, rifles held high to keep them dry, a nd there was sniper fire coming in over the railroad. Then across the railroad, we got across okay, but you get \u0152 for the first Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 50time you\u2122re getting some vicious snapping \u0152 you know, th-the \u0152 or sniping, around. Then it seems that the Germans must have pulled out. We learned however, later on, that one of our men, f ourth platoon was asked and did, because he had good German, go in w ith a white flag and their at \u0152 their \u0152 see if they surrender. The company man who thought th ey might. They wouldn\u2122t. The name was Bob Oelke, o-e-l-k-e. The Germans ignored the white flag, grabbed him, tossed him in the cellar. With presence of mind he went into the next room, because they tossed in some grenades after him, he was alright, he later escaped. But that we learned later. Into the town and then we began moving through. We, meaning the third platoon, we were still there. Now, at that time, as we moved along, by this time it\u2122s probably three, four in the afternoon. Cobblestone streets, rifles on the ready, covering each other. This is called a mopping up operation. But the Germans seemed to have pulled out \u0152 I mean, I don\u2122t remember anything more at that time. And it was then, as we were going up this cobblestone street [indecipherable] that we approached a factory area. Obviously there was some \u0152 and then behind this barbed wire fenc e were these people, unkempt, dirty, emaciated and Mac \u0152 I\u2122m sorry, MacGilvery (ph), in charge, I was behind him, went up and opened the gate. Now, at this point I must explain that for some reason, for some reason, I do not personally recall Mac opening the gate, but I Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 51have talked to him, I say Mac is Sergeant MacGilvery(ph) of Dallas, Texas. He \u0152 he had detail \u0152 details I\u2122d forgotten. Stra nge about memory, some things you \u0152 but Mac is very explicit that he\u2122d opened the gate. The people were in there. They realized apparently we\u2122re Americans, uniforms ra \u0152 they began crowding out and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and trying to embrace us, and \u0152 and \u0152 and kiss us apparently. I don\u2122t recall that. But one thing that was pervasive apparently, and this was confirmed by \u0152 by sar \u0152 Dave Sargent, there at the time, sergeant and later on by Lieutenant \u0152 then Lieutenant, now Captain Greenburg (ph), horrible, heavy, heavy stench and odor. Again, I \u0152 this I didn\u2122t recall and I\u2122m surprised because I\u2122m normally pretty aware of olfactory things. But it was there, amb \u0152 obviously. What I do recall though now, very clearly, myse lf. We had gone into a nearby building, because Mac\u2122s determination was we gotta \u0152 gotta watch out for whate \u0152 there might be krauts around. Kraut being the derogative name for German. There might be krauts here, they gotta check it out. And I remember stepping into the building now, and I think it \u0152 it was a la rge room, maybe 50 by 50 or so. And I do remember there were \u0152 there were some bodies lying around and I remember Mac started to walk over across the room. Now, in his detail, Sergeant MacGilvery(ph), Mac said that there was a skull that he recognized, it \u0152 he \u0152 he\u2122s from Texas. It was horse\u2122s skeleton. And walk ed over. This I remember too, beca Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 52\u0152 he walked over and there was an old \u0152 to me appeared to be an old woman, crouched down, holding something. And \u0152 and Mac was over there, paused for a moment, came back, fury in his eyes and said, now I\u2122m being explicit. Those goddamn fucking krauts, look how they treat these poor sons of bitches. The lady is scraping out that horse\u2122s skull for food and eating it. Gee, well. He also said, forget about the goddamn horse, they\u2122ve sc raped all the meat off that too. There was a heavy \u0152 I remember it now, this at \u0152 there was a heavy odor and \u0152 and we walked past and \u0152 and there was a body. I\u2122m not sure dead or alive, but \u0152 but \u0152 but Mac pointed out the face and he \u0152 he \u0152 look at that poor son of a bitch\u2122s legs, they were \u0152 they were apparently gangrenous and this heavy odor must have been putrid-putri-putrefaction, I\u2122m guessing. Back out into the street, fresh air thank God, because all the other \u0152 and on back out and I remember we got back out in the street and as our patrol got back ou t there, somebody behind me was throwing up, one of our guys be \u0152 just \u0152 just the impact of it. And Mac said, and I did remember this, that a lot of \u0152 they were laborers mostly, whatever, you know [indecipherable] people were out in the street, they just kind of wandered out, the gate was open. A \u0152 an officer came along and advised that we had to get them back inside because they needed attention, whateve r. And they could not be wandering the street by themselves, so somehow, and I don\u2122t recall, they must Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 53have been herded back in, because after that then we \u0152 we moved ahead and we were on our way after that."

And \u0152 and \u0152 and this was just one other part of it, and \u0152 and it did not really assume any great importance until a more recent time, when we realize now, seeing what was happening elsewhere in Germany, the scenes we\u2122ve seen of the death camps.

Maybe, as I suggested, it was only after getting back in a peacetime setting like the \u0152 our har \u0152 our months furlough. And I remember it happened when I was home, after we\u2122d gotten back from Europe, th-the month between, we we nt back several times, I ca \u0152 I kind of \u0152 and I-I-I know that the death of a couple guys swept back. George, Frank\u2122s did, some others we had then too, the \u0152 just the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the immensity of it. After those experiences, you\u2122re do \u0152 you do have dreams and nightmares. I had \u0152 it\u2122s diminished greatly over the years, but after first getting out of the service, an-and let me just finish perhaps by the German experience, we had that then. Then we also had some more drastic experience. We were the second company, the second American company in the whole army to cross the Danube farther south. A company from the 103 rd division to the southwest, crossed in the morning of the 26 th, and we crossed the night of the 26 th, so by \u0152 by an English Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 62[indecipherable] . And we lost a number of people there, and a lot of \u0152 quite a few wounded. Some wounded. But it\u2122s after then as I discovered, getting back over there, I would have occasional dreams that would be quite frightening. I\u2122d wake. They\u2122ve diminished. And yet even now I do have a recurrent dream which is that \u0152 either \u0152 I\u2122m either going to be going into the army again, or I\u2122m in the army again. And I find that I have a feeling of concern, of fear, if you please. And terribly glad to wake up to realize that it is not ha ppening again. That i \u0152 that has come sometimes. The most drastic thing recently was to have seen the movie \ufb01 Saving Private Ryan.\ufb02 Now, I\u2122ve talked to my company \u0152 Captain Greenburg (ph), he\u2122s seen it too. Every \u0152 every combat veteran I\u2122ve talked to has had a similar experience, some more, some less, but I remember, to see it, the first oh, five minutes is in the cemetery, but then \u0152 then you begin \u0152 then one begins seeing the beginning of D-Day with the small craft, the landing craft coming in. Now, we were not D-Day of course, but we did have th e training in amphibious. And it was a remarkable thing because as I watched th at in the darkened theater \u0152 my sa \u0152 Pat wa \u0152 wife Pat did not go. As I watched that and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and the camera, for those who will see it recall that you saw the boats from the side and then that moved over and panned righ t into the boat itself, and you\u2122re looking at the men. Hanks, the captain and the ca \u0152 played the part of the captain. I was there again. It Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 63was like it was our platoon going in. The \u0152 the roar of the motors, the spray of the spray coming over the top. Guys being \u0152 th rowing up around you. The gear all just the same, basically. And I began to cry, just this weeps and then when, in the picture, the craft hit the shore, the ramp went down, typical training, and then the German artillery, the mortars opened up, machine gunning the whole \u0152 I found myself audibly crying, I couldn\u2122t help it. And I \u0152 I\u2122ve \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I have a free sample, Captain Greenburg (ph) who you [indecipherable] have met said he had the same experience. That he \u0152 he had th at happen. He \u0152 he w \u0152 he was weeping. And to drop back to our experience, the lieutenant who had taken the platoon across the Rhine that I spoke of earlier, who had both the command responsibility of that group, a terrible burden to ta ke back. After our first reunion of our company, he attended, it wa s back in \u0152 okay, it was Council Bluffs, my home. We had them there in 90 \u0152 \u212295 and \u212297. In \u212295 for the first time, cap \u0152 Lieutenant Henry came. Now a doctor in Dallas, a \u0152 a very, very fine, but rather sensitive. And we visit a lot and he talked about that experience, the patrol across the Rhine . I had for Lieutenant Henry, after he got back home, a very gracious letter thanking us for \u0152 my wife and I. But he went on to say, the value it was to him to visit with comrades-in-arms of years ago, to just hear about, that \u0152 that it \u0152 he understood things better and that it relieved from his should \u0152 from his shoulders Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 64the burden of guilt that he\u2122d felt all these years. One good thing about reunions, they helped. I talked to him, we were at ak \u0152 our division reunion in newy \u0152 Louisville last September and he\u2122d seen the movie and he said it \u0152 I shouldn\u2122t have, he said, it put me back again. So I think seeing the par \u0152 again, after all these years, it comes back. And you wonder \u0152 what little I read of psychology on it, they \u0152 we\u2122re told in psychology that \u0152 that thes e memories are latent, that certain things can trigger them off. Example, the \u0152 the \u0152 the smell, the odor. I can stand on a street corner today, pass those \u0152 a diesel bus and the diesel fumes take me right back to our training days when the \u0152 the diesel of the outfit. And yet on the other hand, come back to it, I don\u2122t remember anything about the terrible stench at Attendorn. Strange. And I don\u2122t know. My one thought, it might be that \u0152 who can tell about these things? It may have be en a reaction to what \u0152 that night, later on when we were close to death, or the ot hers were close to death and sa \u0152 I \u0152 I don\u2122t know. I-I \u0152 I-I do not have the wisdom to answer that."

On the roads, moving, traveli ng, wherever they might be going. At the city, the town of Eichst\u00e4tt, different because our company commander Captain Mitchell was ill, and then Lieutenant not Captain Greenburg(ph), then age 22 took over the company, and he had the responsibility of 200 men there were [indecipherable] . And we had \u0152 we had it \u0152 a \u0152 a bad time at Ingolstadt \u0152 I take it back, at Eichst\u00e4tt. Got \u0152 got quite a bit of \u0152 of resistance there. Then on down towards the major city of Ingolstadt, which we were told was the hometown of Heinrich Himmler, expect defense. Well, it \u0152 I\u2122m not sure if it was with Himmler or not, but there was a \u0152 going into Ingolstadt was not the bad, but that\u2122s the night we crossed the Danube. There was resistance there and that was a Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 67\u0152 a pretty drastic night, to get in and get across basically, cross the river. As I said, we were th \u0152 we were the \u0152 we were the second company of the Americans to go cro \u0152 I mean, a \u0152 the whole American army to cross, apparently. We got a counterattack that night, got some \u0152 oh, we had a number who were killed, two or three killed, I think, and quite a few wounded. And that\u2122s one of the nights one realizes how thin is the veneer of civilization, by which I mean this. I remember that I was the \u0152 I was the platoon runner by that time, sort of ran messages between the company command posts, CP and our \u0152 where we were, some \u0152 oh, some blocks away. In the black of the ni ght the Germans had come in, and the ka \u0152 and then several were wounded. And I remember going past and this \u0152 this German was crying, he says, I am bless\u00e9, well, French for woun \u0152 well, be \u0152 any \u0152 and I remember I \u0152 I said \u0152 I just \u0152 I said, [speaks German] shut up. I mean, I \u0152 no compassion at all on my part, huh? Yeah, I mean, you know, just \u0152 that was it. And you realize that yeah, I suppose that\u2122s our training and to \u0152 basically we \u0152 we couldn\u2122t \u0152 couldn\u2122t take a chance, that ki nd of a thing. Maybe he was \u0152 maybe he was just a \u0152 faking it, who knows? I couldn\u2122t take a chance. That was Ingolstadt and then we were there brief, and then after that really, the war was really finish up because by that time we were just on the move in \u0152 in \u0152 or sometimes \u0152 sometimes we were riding tanks and going ou t ahead, other times mostly in trucks. Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 68Then, within a matter of a week we were down in Austria, we crossed into Austria. We \u0152 we stopped, oh we were pro \u0152 at a small town called Perwang, which is about 20 \u0152 p-e \u0152 p-e-r-w-a-n-g, about 20 kilometers north of Salzburg, we were in Austria. And there \u0152 we were there when the word that the \u0152 it was May seventh or May eighth, take your c hoice, the war was over. And immediately rumors began coming, okay you guys, you\u2122re already \u0152 there \u0152 you\u2122re going to the Pacific. My God. Well, the thought was bad, but in the meantime we realized we were gonna have some time at home. So indeed that\u2122s what happened. We came back by truck back to Mannheim. We were there in Mannheim for a time, probably just a few days only in Feudenheim then truck again back across France to the same tents we were in when we first came, in Old Gold. And then \u0152 then we got new uniforms, got the combat jackets. Pretty spiffy stuff, we thought. And now getting ready for home. Trucks down to LaHavre. I was mentioning to Captain Greenburg (ph) when we talked today, as we were leaving LaHavre now, some romantic soul put on the loudspeaker system Debussy\u2122s Clair de Lune. That was a nice departure. A week back to cross the Atlantic and then came this tumultuous arrival at home, because we were the first division back from Europe and we had the grand welcome. Blimps in the sky, fireboats in the \u0152 in New York harbor. Great big, huge banner across a hill, well done, welcome home. And off \u0152 Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 69off the ships. Our ship had on a great big panel, ETO to Tokyo. Well. But we got in and my captain, Captain Reed(ph), we were still [indecipherable] tell me that he \u0152 his home was Hoboken. His parents had learned of our return and his father was able to get around over to the Manhattan\u2122s ri \u0152 we \u0152 I think he s \u0152 I the captain said pier 77 or something. 57. Go t off and his father was right out there. Father shoved and pushed, he \u0152 right past and he bay \u0152 they kissed. Marvelous, huh. And even the rest of us, it \u0152 it was tremendous to come back, our own country again. Amazingly \u0152 I have it here , but amazingly there were \u0152 we had dignitaries and well wishers, but a lot of media. Reporter \u0152 a reporter from the \ufb01Des Moines Register\ufb02 was there and we had a grea t big feature, which I still saved at home basically, the \u0152 the Blackhawks back again and they had the \u0152 the name of every Iowan who was coming back and \u0152 and so there were many, many happy families. We knew from the Register at home they knew we\u2122d been in combat, that\u2122s the first word, because that had a little feature, what they\u2122ve done. And they had in the Register, toward the end of April that the 86th was in combat. Course, folks were just terribly tied up, terribly tied up. An amazing thing happened, a tragic thing. When I \u0152 we got back to Mannheim , got our mail for the first time. My mother had written that she met a good high school friend of hers of Council Bluffs, now in Omaha , they got talking and her son was in the 86th, Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 70[indecipherable] together, his name was \u0152 was Captain Bruce McAllister, of our K company [indecipherable] in our regiment. And I remember as clearly sitting as we\u2122re sitting here. I remember saying to one of our \u0152 I said, my gosh, Wes, I \u0152 I\u2122ve got to look up this Captain McAllister. He says, Pete, you\u2122re too late. He was killed two weeks ago, down on the \u0152 on the [indecipherable] down the Danube. So those things happen. That was \u0152 now \u0152"

But to all of us, to all of us, we can go back, and in our experien ce, in this \u0152 in the world in which we live, the \u0152 the \u0152 i-in my terms, the crucible of contra \u0152 of combat, you can see and remember the expression a certain fellow had, one of your \u0152 one of your G.I. buddies on the street corner at a certain time.

An-And th-there is no solution to that, no answer. I-I think maybe the religious faith, you know, faith in God, of course, in the hereafter if we\u2122re going to accept that, is important. S \u0152 but apropos of the matter of \u0152 of how to reason it out, it ca \u0152 it cannot be reasoned out.

We \u0152 we\u2122ve seen the movie \ufb01Patton\ufb02 [indecipherable] well, we don\u2122t love him, but \u0152 but it\u2122s undeniable and many, many, many people feel this, that there is an incredible thrill in that situation, if you come through.

I think [indecipherable] good guys, wonderful guys. Why, why, why, huh? Huh? My good friend Sergeant Smith, Smitty was our re \u0152 machine gun section.

The old saying, forgot who it was, Germans are ei ther at your feet or at your throat. I \u0152 I can\u2122t answer \u0152 generalizations are always a little bit dangerous, I mean, you know, you can\u2122t follow it that much, but we\u2122ve been in Germany a number of times, enjoy it, beautiful country, good friends. And yet, and yet. Captain Greenburg(ph), ther \u0152 they\u2122re both Jewish and his wife Phyllis will not go to Germany. Will not go to Germany. For my own part we \u0152 we \u0152 as I said, we have good friends in Germany, we enjoy having been there basically. We\u2122re thinking now about maybe this Octobe r, October \u212299 with a good friend from home who has lived some length of time in Germany, has good German, of going back. I\u2122d like to begin, if we go back in October, at the Margraten cemetery, American cemetery where my \u0152 where George Evans is buried. Then up into the Ruhr again to see it and then down into Bavaria, Eichst\u00e4tt, Ingol \u0152 and I don\u2122t know, just \u0152 interesting. We\u2122ll see. We\u2122ll see."

Oh, he chuckled [indecipherable] said, you know, he said, I was in grade school at home with a young kid, he used to \u0152 I\u2122m gonn a be a lawyer, I\u2122m gonna be a lawyer.

I wonder sometimes what their fate was, if they were ru \u0152 were Russian, probably a bad fate. What we read, at least about the prisoners of war, the Russians, they were not accepted back or they were, if they were taken back they were \u0152 brutal thing. As far as the civ ilians, I \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122ve \u0152 I sometimes wonder what Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 93happened to those people, a-again, you kno w. Didn\u2122t think at the time, but after the pass of years you wonder about it, basically. Interestingly also, I did some checking out \u0152 I had occasion to read \u0152 check back in to the records of the Nuremberg \u0152 Nuremberg. November, it began. One of the major cases was that of a Field Marshal Milch m-i-n-l \u0152 m-i-l-c-h, Milch, who was a subordinate of Albert Speer, and that was the [indecipherable]. He was one was responsible for the \u0152 the so-called forced labor, alright? And in the exhibits presented at Nuremberg in his behalf were requirements by the Reich supposedly that these people would be adequately fed and care d for. Not humanitarianly-wise, but to insure the fact they could do the work they were going to do, huh. The other was \u0152 simply seemed secondary, basically. And of course in the case of these poor people, in ha \u0152 admittedly now, probably the logistical system had broken down, I mean as far as food, but that does not still explain in a \u0152 in any way excuse the way they were being held. Read, as we have, Manchester\u2122s book, \ufb01The Arms of Krupp,\ufb02 and the \u0152 and the \u0152 and th-the treatment to which the Kruppianer subjected all their force people, huh. It\u2122s an incredible thing, incredible living in it. And \u0152 and what we saw that afternoon, I mean, the way these that \u0152 the way these people were.

            "answer": "Well, it\u2122s quite inters \u0152 it\u2122s quite interesting. Number one, there had been a great \u0152 a great tradition, history of tolerance in Denmark . Smaller countries [indecipherable] also. But early enlightenment, which began in Denmark in the 1820\u2122s - 30\u2122s, they had \u0152 they had left the monarchy , I mean the \u0152 the actual absolute monarchy and into more of a constitutional monarchy, th-that helped. A smaller country, as I mentioned again, a nd beyond that, I\u2122m not sure, except that there was \u0152 it was indeed a safe haven. Now, as to how the wonderful escape took place in October, several things I \u0152 I read \u0152 as we read it. Number one, there had been the great feeling of the Danish people. The-The-These are not Danish Jews, Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 95it\u2122s Jewish Danes. A subtle distinction, but it\u2122s interesting. Secondly the war situation was turning against Germany. Allies were in north Africa by that time. Stalingrad had been completed. The genera l feeling was \u0152 was different. The proximity \u0152 the proximity of Sweden now, made it possible, which might, in a landlocked country not have happened, huh. And the willingness of the Swedes to accept it. There\u2122s a wonderful story told apro pos of that, about the Swedish side of it now. When the time came that was realized the Germans were going to move, to take the Danish Jews, time was short. It was a matter of days, but they had to somehow \u0152 they meaning the Danish pe ople under their leadership and the resistance get them out. But they had to have the agreement of Sweden to take them. They could not deal with Germany and say \u0152 because that would tip it off. So what was determined, from what I read, was this, they realized that the Danish leadership, they had to get the agreement of the Swedish crown. The arrangement was made that they, the Danish people wo uld select, hopefully, that \u0152 a leader of the Danish Jewish community to hopefully visit with the King of Sweden . It was arranged. And the person selected was Niels Bohr, the great atomic [indecipherable] . The story goes on to say that in \u0152 in Bohr\u2122s words he said \u0152 he said, I\u2122m a scientist, not an advocate, he said, why \u0152 well, they said you have th-the standing, the name, the King will \u0152 all right. It was arranged remarkably Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 96[indecipherable] . Then, in just a matter of hours they set this up and apparently then, either \u0152 either by boat \u0152 they\u2122re not \u0152 they\u2122re \u0152 they\u2122re \u0152 they\u2122re still \u0152 they\u2122re c-careful, or possibly by a British aircraft, the Mosquito coming, take him over, Bohr was taken to Stockholm, to probably Drottningholm and the palace, the story is told. He said, in I went, to this massive palace. Re-Realized what was on my shoulders to try and get this done, to persuade the king. I was shown into the room. Had a room and th-th-th-the ki ng\u2122s attendant was there, basically very fine, he said Dr. Bohr , please wait. Then he said the moment came, he said [indecipherable] here \u0152 here \u0152 here I am just becoming more tense by the moment. The door opened and they said, Dr. Bohr, the king will see you now. He said, I stepped in and here was this very pleasant looking gentleman, it was the king, King Gustav. Gustav Aroff (ph) I think it was. And he said, I-I have some Swedish. And he said, I explained in [indecipherable] as best I could the plight of our people, what was going to happen and \u0152 and that we desperately pled for help. He said, the king, very cour teous, stood up. He said, of course I stood up too. The king walked to the window, looked out. He said that \u0152 I can [indecipherable] it was probably all of maybe 10 seconds , but he came back and said, Dr. Bohr, your people will be welcome in Sweden. And that was it, laid the foundation. So, a combination of things put together, you se e, and of course the \u0152 it was not all \u0152 I Interview with Richard Peterson April 6, 1999 97mean there were \u0152 there were some problems to getting them \u0152 getting the Danes across or getting the \u0152 the \u0152 the Jews across, the Jewish people. Some \u0152 some boat people did charge, others did not, back and forth, but it still was a remarkable, remarkable thing, huh? Incredible."
