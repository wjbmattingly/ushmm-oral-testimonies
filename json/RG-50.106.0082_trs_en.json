So if there were any announcements of anything, this impor \u2014 of importance, this 1s where it would take place. People didn\u2019t have telephones.

And it was \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I must say also, I had relatives in Zurich, so I had somebody that I could be in touch with, it wasn\u2019t that I was completely alone in that respect. One of the most \u2014 the things I remember most distinctly, and I guess from that I assume that I must have started really becoming interested in history and politics and so on, cause I remember when \u2014 when the German Russian non-aggression pact was signed, I prin \u2014 I announced that this means ya \u2014 war in Europe. Then of course I few week \u2014 couple weeks later, it actually started. And the announcements for \u2014 mobilization announcements of course were posted at the milk collecting station.

I remember that at that point the swi \u2014 the kids were organized through the school, and I think I was part of the group that was supposed to help drive the cattle into the mountains. Judging from my experience in cattle driving before that, I\u2019m not sure I would have contributed very much to the Swiss war effort, if it had of come to that. But it \u2014 fortunately didn\u2019t. So I stayed there, but as I say, there were certain \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we had certain, how shall we say, there were cer \u2014 a certain amount of friction between the family.

But anyhow it \u2014 he taught me very quickly that words and language, necessarily \u2014 just because you know the word does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s appropriate. Then of course, I think we stayed there about two weeks and then something happened to me that was probably of great value to me. I had another uncle and aunt \u2014an aunt. She had come to the United States already in the 20s, so they both had come to the States in the 20s. And they were great outdoors people, they loved hiking. And they took me, within about two weeks of arriving in the States, they took me out for a two week hike in the mountains, in the Adirondacks or someplace, and told everybody, or every one of their friends to talk only English to me. So this was what we would today call deep immersion, and it was great because after two weeks I had a fairly decent command of the language. That \u2014 you know, the \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a little rough at the time, because you get frustrated in going through it, but in retrospect, or even at that point, I mean, immediately afterwards, or even at the time, you recognize that this is the way to go. And then things happened fairly quickly after the \u2014 went in fairly rapid succession. I remember my mother went to work in one of the New York sweat shops as a sewing machine operator, and where one of my aunts worked, and she \u2014 that was her first job. That\u2019s one the real, I wouldn\u2019t say untold stories, but it\u2019s one of the things that I must say we have not given quite enough recognition to it, although I\u2019m sure it happens even today that some of these people make these changes and they\u2019re tremendous.

And this is where, in going through the Ministry of Justice files, I had an interesting experience, because having lived through Kristallnacht, I decided this was a good time to look at some of the files having to do with Crystal Night. And the document center had a lot of German employees, who we would indicate from registers what documents we wanted, or what folders we \u2014 what folders we wanted, and they would This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And one day this gentleman brought me some files, I started getting some files having to do with \u2014 with Herschel Grynszpan and the \u2014 the Crystal Night events and afterwards. And he said to me, I see you\u2019re interested in the events in Paris in 1938, and I said yes, I certainly was. And at that point I had in front of me a \u2014 the future \u2014 the trial schedule. The Germans had planned to put on trial Herschel Grynszpan after he had been turned over to the German authorities in 1941, after the fall of France. And two of the witnesses were going to be members of the germ \u2014 the embassy staff in Paris, namely \u2014 I mean, low level staff; one was a clerk who was at the front gate when he came in, when Grynszpan came in to \u2014 and the other was the clerk at the information desk who, in fact, took Herschel Grynszpan to see vom Rath, the German third secretary who then \u2014 and he subsequently went and shot him. And this, of course triggered, or was used as an excuse for the events of Crystal Night. And I \u2014 the trial preparation called for these two clerks to testify. I asked them whether he knew Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph), clerk so and so, and he says yes, I knew him quite well. I said, well, what about Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph) or clerk Nagorka? He was the man who \u2014 to whom Herschel Grynszpan said whom he wanted to see. This was a fairly important bit of evidence because of some of the \u2014 th-the arguments being made whether or not vom Rath was the actual intended victim, or the accidental victim. And the clerk said well nag \u2014 clerk Nagorka, that\u2019s me. So that was a rather startling bit of information, but anyhow, he provided me the information This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And so the question was, the key question was, did Herschel Grynszpan ask for vom Rath in person, or did he just ask for a German clerk \u2014 a German officer. And the answer, according to Nagorka was, he asked to see an embassy official. And this was a key bit of evidence."

By far and away the mo \u2014 well, almost the most interesting or comprehensive trail led to the Reich\u2019s Chancellery, Hitler\u2019s office. Because every time one minister wrote something to another minister, especially if they had a fight, they would send an \u2014 a copy to Hitler\u2019s Secretary of the Chancellery. So there you would have both the letter being sent, and the letter being coming back. I mean, when a peop \u2014 person like the Minister of Post got mad \u2014 or the Minister of Agriculture got mad at the Minister of Post, and accused him \u2014 accused him of having an illegitimate child, he would send a copy to the chancellery and then the Ministry of Posts would then re-reply to the Minister of Agriculture in a rather nasty letter, and also send a copy to the chancellery.

Basically, what happened, Herschel Grynszpan avoided trial, or when the Germans were all ready there to put Herschel Grynszpan on the world stage, on trial \u2014 for this they had already invited, or were ready to invite the main newspaper people from around th-the \u2014 the neutral Europe.

And he was the number one criminal lawyer in France in \u2014 in the 20\" century; certainly the first half of the fu \u2014 20\" century, who had really been the lawyer for just about every \u2014 every major criminal trial, especially murder trials. Well, Moro-Giafferi smiled, laughed, and he says, well, let me explain where he got that idea. He says, when I initially took up his defense \u2014 and he had been hired, as I said, by Dorothy Thompson, who at that point was a major figure in American journalism, foreign correspondent in the days when foreign correspondents were still major figures, in \u2014 in the days when you didn\u2019t have instantaneous CNN coverage and so on. He said, I told \u2014 I asked Herschel why he had killed vom Rath, and he said, because had gotten this postcard, and what happened to his parents. And I explained that this matter \u2014 Moro-Giafferi speaking \u2014 I explained to him that French juries are not terribly friendly disposed towards political crimes. However, in a case of crimes of passion, French juries are much more lenient. And since there had been rumors, which I have certainly not been able to confirm, that vom Rath had homosexual tendencies, and had been rumors in town that he had visited homosexual places, he suggested that he may want to argue that there was a homosexual connection between the two.

Then we have recently done some work in connection with the claims by American soldiers at \u2014 or Americans who are seeking restitution from Germany for incarceration in concentration camps. And so there\u2019s a question of definition, what is a concentration camp, because it\u2019s not always clear. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I \u2014 I have the feeling that being \u2014 I n \u2014I know there are a number of survivors \u2014 first of all, of course, I have trouble with the word survivor. I do not consider myself a survivor. I know people who\u2019 ve been in L\u00e9dz; they\u2019re survivors. Then of course then, I am not a survivor, I\u2019m a\u2014 I\u2019m a refugee, you can call any sort of thing, but survivor, I don\u2019t feel I am. Then, of course, then there\u2019s the \u2014 the group in between, and that is, for instance, my wife, who is out \u2014 who was never in a conce \u2014 went to \u2014 to England in a \u2014 in a children\u2019s transport. Had a much tougher time, and of course, most of all, lost her parents. Does she belong in the survivor cat \u2014 she doesn\u2019t consider herself to be a survivor. It\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s very difficult, but to me, the \u2014 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question. To my wife\u2019s cousin, who was in Lodz, or was in \u2014 1n Auschwitz, no question either. It\u2019s that in-between, gray area. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The second point 1s, I don\u2019t think that by virtue of being a survivor, you become an expert. No, quite frankly, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve made myself very unpopular already. I mean, I\u2019ve only attended one survivor group so far, and I\u2019ve made myself unpopular [indecipherable] by basically saying, just because somebody\u2019s a survivor, they don \u2014 does not mean that they\u2019re necessarily the best guides. So ve been accused since then of being an academic, or being too \u2014 too feeling that you have to have university degree and so on. Which isn\u2019t, of course, at all what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m just saying that, being the be \u2014 being the best guide, or a guide, it\u2019s interesting to be able to say to a group, this person lived through it, but that does not make that \u2014 that\u2019s important, but it doesn\u2019t make necessarily a \u2014 a qualified guide, or the best guide. There might be somebody who had no connection with it, and yet still is able to do a great job. So, I have a \u2014 perhaps a slightly different point of view than some of my fellow volunteers."
