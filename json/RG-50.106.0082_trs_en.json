And so it was dairy, we lived across the street from the dairy co \u2014 the milk collection point. And yes, I was supposed to watch the cows out in the field, wasn\u2019t very good at it.

In other words, your farmer would have one field east of town and maybe another one north of town and so on. So we had these cows out there and every now and then when the cows wanted to go home and nobody came to get us, the cows just went home. I mean, I was not terribly successful as a cow herder. And every now and then I would trail the cows into town and shoo them in the other way around. I was supposed to lead them back. But, every now \u2014 and of course when they go, they won\u2019t go ina straight line, which means they go across the fields of the neighbors and so on. We did a certain amount of damage.

So if there were any announcements of anything, this impor \u2014 of importance, this 1s where it would take place. People didn\u2019t have telephones. And, in fact, I used to have to go to the post office to make phone calls home. And it was \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I must say also, I had relatives in Zurich, so I had somebody that I could be in touch with, it wasn\u2019t that I was completely alone in that respect. One of the most \u2014 the things I remember most distinctly, and I guess from that I assume that I must have started really becoming interested in history and politics and so on, cause I remember when \u2014 when the German Russian non-aggression pact was signed, I prin \u2014 I announced that this means ya \u2014 war in Europe. Then of course I few week \u2014 couple weeks later, it actually started. And the announcements for \u2014 mobilization announcements of course were posted at the milk collecting station. This is where everybody came to. That Interview with Gerald Schwab \u201d November 18, 1997 was early in the morning when we got up and by noon everybody was getting on the local streetcar in a\u2014 1n a uniform. So, you know, Swiss \u2014 Swiss males took their uniforms home and their wife will sew them after doing their military service. So it was a matter of \u2014 within a matter of hours that they had \u2014 could mobilize the troops. Actually, the kids were mobilized too. I remember that at that point the swi \u2014 the kids were organized through the school, and I think I was part of the group that was supposed to help drive the cattle into the mountains. Judging from my experience in cattle driving before that, I\u2019m not sure I would have contributed very much to the Swiss war effort, if it had of come to that. But it \u2014 fortunately didn\u2019t. So I stayed there, but as I say, there were certain \u2014 the \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we had certain, how shall we say, there were cer \u2014 a certain amount of friction between the family. I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t know who \u2014 to whom to attribute it, I\u2019m sure I shared it, I probably was a disappointment to them. I was not being ruralized very quickly while I was there.

I did try out a new word on one of my cousins, took me down to the street and I can\u2019t recall what it was, we met some kids down on the street in front of the house, in front of the apartment building, and I tried out another word, and that\u2019s when I discovered that that probably was not the appropriate one, because he just hit me in the side of the head. I got a nice big lump on the side of my head. My mother almost fainted when she saw it. It looked a lot \u2014 I\u2019m sure it looked a lot worse than it Interview with Gerald Schwab * November 18, 1997 was. But anyhow it \u2014 he taught me very quickly that words and language, necessarily \u2014 just because you know the word does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s appropriate. Then of course, I think we stayed there about two weeks and then something happened to me that was probably of great value to me. I had another uncle and aunt \u2014an aunt. She had come to the United States already in the 20s, so they both had come to the States in the 20s. And they were great outdoors people, they loved hiking. And they took me, within about two weeks of arriving in the States, they took me out for a two week hike in the mountains, in the Adirondacks or someplace, and told everybody, or every one of their friends to talk only English to me. So this was what we would today call deep immersion, and it was great because after two weeks I had a fairly decent command of the language. That \u2014 you know, the \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a little rough at the time, because you get frustrated in going through it, but in retrospect, or even at that point, I mean, immediately afterwards, or even at the time, you recognize that this is the way to go. And then things happened fairly quickly after the \u2014 went in fairly rapid succession. I remember my mother went to work in one of the New York sweat shops as a sewing machine operator, and where one of my aunts worked, and she \u2014 that was her first job. That\u2019s one the real, I wouldn\u2019t say untold stories, but it\u2019s one of the things that I must say we have not given quite enough recognition to it, although I\u2019m sure it happens even today that some of these people make these changes and they\u2019re tremendous. I mean, adapted in Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18, 1997 ways that is unimaginable perhaps to us today. Although I\u2019m sure that a lot of ref \u2014 other refugees, refugees today, who may be doing the same thing I do. Anyhow, my mother went to \u2014 did this \u2014 did \u2014 became a sewing machine operator. And then we moved to Long Branch, New Jersey, where I went to school, and my mother and father worked as a maid and a sort of a handyman-butler with a family, with a New York lawyer. And, now, it was amazing that my mother could do it, but the fact that my father suddenly became a sort of handymaid \u2014 handyman-chauffeur and jack-of- all-trades was also quite amazing.

Broke a finger in the process, you catch it between two bowling balls. It was a fairly dangerous sport. I worked on the beach in Long Branch, dishing out ice cream during the summer. That sort of thing.

And lo and behold, after they \u2014 they did this and I think they went through training, there was a training unit near [indecipherable] New Jersey, and \u2014 or Bound Brook, New Jersey. And after that, they \u2014 with the aid of \u2014 of the Joint, they bought a poultry farm in a place, in Cranberry, New Jersey, which is next to Hightstown, which is near Princeton.

I went to high school there, had a \u2014 you know, I was \u2014 I was a new kid in town, it was pleasant enough. I went to Hightstown High. Had no untoward experiences there except apparently the English teacher told another class that she didn\u2019t believe what I was saying about having left Germany in 1940, because my English was too good. And we were then there in June of \u2014 I remember in June of 1941 when the war broke out with the Russians. The German-Russian was broke out. I believe that\u2019s where we were.

And regrettably, we only had two men in the battalion who spoke good German. So either he or \u2014 or I went out in most patrols at night. I mean, I \u2014 I would go out and patrol with our own comp \u2014 for \u2014 for me \u2014 patrol for my own company, and for other companies.

I must say, I didn\u2019t volunteer for these things, I usually was volunteered. And a bicycle rider came down the middle of the street, uniform, and coming towards us. And he came and came bef \u2014 I thought somebody was going to shoot the poor guy, because he obviously didn\u2019t know what was going on. And finally I jumped out of the ditch and went up and in my best German stopped him. And he started arguing with me in German because the 10\" Mountain uniforms were very much like German parachuter uniforms, and he thought he had encountered another amer \u2014 German unit, and he was telling me that he had a very important message for the commanding general.

It was, you know, 15 year old boy\u2019s German. But it got me into some interesting places like the German underground communications facilities in Verona, where all the German telephone lines and so on came together. Then one side you had the chief American engineers and the German engineers and I was in between. Fortunately, when it came to technical terms they were able to \u2014 to communicate without me.

And they said all right, they finally \u2014 I remember, I think I had to change a couple hundred orders, because they had about a hundred, couple hundred people on \u2014 on these orders to a certain place, and I had to go through each and every one of them and rule out my name; they let me do that.

The Nuremberg Trials actually had 22 main defendants, but in addition to that, it had seven organizations which were on trial. Things like the SA, the SS, the general staff, the Reich\u2019s cabinet. The idea being that if the members of the organization, if the organization were declared as guilty of war crimes, then members above a certain level, or maybe at any level, would automatically be considered as \u2014 as guilty. And now, since however there were too many people that either wanted to testify, or provide affidavits, or statements in connection with these things, separate hearings were held, in a separate room, before a public, but they were done in German and English.

            "answer": "No, this was one of the nice things in this, because A, the interpreter sat right next to the witness. These were not defendants, the main defendants never came. These were people that testified. Some of them were subject later on to subsequent trials. And others then were, for instance, [indecipherable] Dieter Wisliceny, who was \u2014 Interview with Gerald Schwab \u201c\u00b0 November 18, 1997 was what\u2019s his name\u2019s deputy. Heydrich. No, not Heydrich, Eichmann\u2019s deputy was one of the people that testified, and he later on was sent off to Poland, where he was executed. One of the nice things was that the interpreter sat right next to the witness, you weren\u2019t separated by a glass wall. There was no microphone or anything like this, and you had \u2014 could have conversations with him during the break. In addition to that, your work as a \u2014 an interpreter usually, maximally you could do this for \u2014 it was for about an hour and a half. It was fairly strenuous. And you would sit \u2014 either you\u2019d sit in the room itself, in the courtroom, or you would sit in a waiting room, and that\u2019s where, usually, the next witness was waiting with a guard. And so you could sit there and talk and \u2014 yeah, had some interesting conversations. I had \u2014 Kesselring once asked me, Field Marshall Kesselring, he and I, we \u2014 we sat there waiting to go \u2014 go onstage, and he wanted to know where I \u2014 well, first \u2014 first we \u2014 where I'd been, and I\u2019d been, of course, in Italy, and he had been in Italy. Now, slightly different positions obviously, but we discussed military strategy in Italy to the extent that I was able to. He then wanted to know where I\u2019d learned my German, and I told him. And his reaction was, well, that must be a great satisfaction for you to be here. And I said, it certainly is, Field Marshall. So, you know, some of these \u2014 Rundstedt once talked \u2014 gave his testimony, and he talked for \u2014 we had \u2014 we had told him, look, I can take about four minutes, five minutes maximum, but after that I can\u2019t do any more. And so he made a 10 minute speech, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Gerald Schwab -\" November 18, 1997 and then turned to me, and I sort of shrugged my shoulders. And I turned to the judge, who in turn said, well, we can have the court reporter read it off, and then we'll translate it from that. The court reporter said, I couldn\u2019t follow him either, I was hoping the interpreter could. So we all turned back to Field Marshall Rundstedt, who then said \u2014 gave the exact same speech, broken into two parts. It was amazing. This man \u2014 I mean, he \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say it was rehearsed, but he gave exactly the same thing all over again. So anyhow, so it was \u2014 there were some interesting experiences, the \u2014 the last head of the SA gave testimony about Crystal Night. And actually, I prefer to call 1t pogrom of 1938. And he was telling how the SA really was a, more or less a social organization whose main task was to protect Jewish lives and property during \u2014 during this period, during Crystal Night."

And I had to get a deposition from two people. One was General Stiilpnagel, who was the commander in Paris from 1940 to 1942. He \u2014 there were two Stulpnagel gen-generals, Sttilpnagel; one of them was involved in the \u2014 the attack on Hitler, this was not the one.

Now I saw Helmut Knochen before that, in Nuremberg, and in Nuremberg it was very interesting because in Nuremberg the French prosecutor had a number of questions to ask him. And he would ask Knochen and Knochen, who, by the way, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Gerald Schwab \u201d November 18, 1997 had it \u2014 a PhD in linguistics, would deny that he ever heard of this, and the French prosecutor, man by the name of Monterey(ph) would pick up a piece of paper and say well, is this your signature or not, and the man would say yes.

Well, after that it was almost like Pavlov\u2019s dog, because all that Monterey(ph) had to do 1s pick up a piece of paper and Knochen would admit everything. Well, when I got to Paris, here was, in Cherche-Midi prison \u2014 Cherche-Midi Prison looks something like a \u2014 we sort of imagined French prisons to look in the 18\" century. You \u2014 when you knocked on the gate, somebody would come with a key about a foot long, and there wasn\u2019t very much oil in the lock, and they would open it, and then you\u2019d walk in, and then there\u2019s a room full of French prison guards and one of \u2014 couple of them were getting haircuts, in another part they were \u2014 some were playing cards. And so you finally get to this guy, you get to the prosecutor\u2019s office, and they would bring in Helmut Knochen. This was in 1946. Well, they\u2019d given helm \u2014 it was cold, it was December. Helmut \u2014 they had given Helmut Knochen \u2014 they must have given him one shaving \u2014 one razor blade a month there, because he had a stubble beard.

Well, Gleiwitz \u2014 Gleiwitz radio station was a German radio station on \u2014 right on the Polish border, and just before the war broke out between Germany and Poland, there was an attack on this German radio station by Poles and Hitler gave it as one of the main reasons for attacking Poland. And the witness, who was a member of the SD, German counterintelligence, said yes, I know something about it. Says, what do you know about it? Says, I was in charge. Well, no \u2014 there are times when you wish that the prosecutors would let you know something like that. They knew what was coming up, I had no idea. I knew from history what the Gleiwitz radio station attack was, but you know, this was the first indication I ever got that 1t was \u2014 1t \u2014 it was a German a \u2014 attack. I mean, you suspected it, but Interview with Gerald Schwab . November 18, 1997 you never suspected to meet the man that was in charge of it.

I mean, Germans were very precise and practical. Law requirement was to have a registry. And they had one, but they didn\u2019t want to spend all that much trouble, to invent a new cause of death for each case, so they make ditto marks. They gave the name and then a ditto mark under it. This is where, as I say, so many of the \u2014 some devastating materials of that type were found. Orders which were signed by officials. One of the nice things the Germans did as far as the prosecution was concerned, was that every leading official had his own \u2014 had \u2014 had an initial. Well, those are very frequently difficult to decipher. But what was nice, they all used different colors. So if you saw a blue initial, let\u2019s say, in the \u2014 in the Ministry of Justice, you know exactly who saw it, and if you saw a red one, you know who saw it. So it wasn\u2019t just you \u2014 you could identify the individual, and we\u2019re talking here at the top level obviously, at the sub-muinistry level, and the sub-minister level. And this is where, in going through the Ministry of Justice files, I had an interesting experience, because having lived through Kristallnacht, I decided this was a good time to look at some of the files having to do with Crystal Night. And the document center had a lot of German employees, who we would indicate from registers what documents we wanted, or what folders we \u2014 what folders we wanted, and they would Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Gerald Schwab \u2122 November 18, 1997 bring it. And one day this gentleman brought me some files, I started getting some files having to do with \u2014 with Herschel Grynszpan and the \u2014 the Crystal Night events and afterwards. And he said to me, I see you\u2019re interested in the events in Paris in 1938, and I said yes, I certainly was. And at that point I had in front of me a \u2014 the future \u2014 the trial schedule. The Germans had planned to put on trial Herschel Grynszpan after he had been turned over to the German authorities in 1941, after the fall of France. And two of the witnesses were going to be members of the germ \u2014 the embassy staff in Paris, namely \u2014 I mean, low level staff; one was a clerk who was at the front gate when he came in, when Grynszpan came in to \u2014 and the other was the clerk at the information desk who, in fact, took Herschel Grynszpan to see vom Rath, the German third secretary who then \u2014 and he subsequently went and shot him. And this, of course triggered, or was used as an excuse for the events of Crystal Night. And I \u2014 the trial preparation called for these two clerks to testify. I asked them whether he knew Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph), clerk so and so, and he says yes, I knew him quite well. I said, well, what about Amski(ph) Hilfa(ph) or clerk Nagorka? He was the man who \u2014 to whom Herschel Grynszpan said whom he wanted to see. This was a fairly important bit of evidence because of some of the \u2014 th-the arguments being made whether or not vom Rath was the actual intended victim, or the accidental victim. And the clerk said well nag \u2014 clerk Nagorka, that\u2019s me. So that was a rather startling bit of information, but anyhow, he provided me the information Interview with Gerald Schwab \u201d November 18, 1997 that I wanted. And this was a \u2014 basically the beginning of the \u2014 the beginning of my research for a book which I finally finished about 40 years later."

The question was, did \u2014 at that point Grynszpan was asking \u2014 this was in 1942, after he had turned over to the Germans of \u201941, he claimed that he shot vom Rath for personal reasons. And so the question was, the key question was, did Herschel Grynszpan ask for vom Rath in person, or did he just ask for a German clerk \u2014 a German officer. And the answer, according to Nagorka was, he asked to see an embassy official. And this was a key bit of evidence."

The \u2014 some of them were \u2014 at that point in Nuremberg, the medical trial was going on, but subsequ \u2014 they were looking for materials for subsequent trials, the Ministry of Justice, and various other ministries. And you just sort of \u2014 either you were told, or you were given advice where to look, or you sort of followed a hunch, or you followed something, so \u2014 something followed a trail which suddenly Interview with Gerald Schwab ia November 18, 1997 opened up. By far and away the mo \u2014 well, almost the most interesting or comprehensive trail led to the Reich\u2019s Chancellery, Hitler\u2019s office. Because every time one minister wrote something to another minister, especially if they had a fight, they would send an \u2014 a copy to Hitler\u2019s Secretary of the Chancellery. So there you would have both the letter being sent, and the letter being coming back. I mean, when a peop \u2014 person like the Minister of Post got mad \u2014 or the Minister of Agriculture got mad at the Minister of Post, and accused him \u2014 accused him of having an illegitimate child, he would send a copy to the chancellery and then the Ministry of Posts would then re-reply to the Minister of Agriculture in a rather nasty letter, and also send a copy to the chancellery. So that \u2014 there was a lot of information obtainable there. But mainly, you would stumble across something.

It was used by the Nazis as an excuse. But it was the beginning, it was the first time, really, with a couple of minor exceptions of centralized \u2014 centrally directed anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish activities in Germany. And while there were obviously earlier ones, like the boycott of nine \u2014 April 1933, the book burning of May 1, 1933, but after that it was really these \u2014 most of the things that happened were locally inspired, or locally activated. This, the events, once they got going, and even though Crystal Night was not centrally directed in the normally accepted term of the word \u2014 the wor \u2014 yeah \u2014 afterwards, it certainly was, and that was the beginning, to me, of the Holocaust. I \u2014 I found this young man \u2014 the story, of course, is that somebody, his parents \u2014 a young Polish Jew, living in Germany, born in Germany. His parents had lived in Germany since 1911, walked into \u2014 heard \u2014 heard that his pare \u2014 he was living in Interview with Gerald Schwab \u201d November 18, 1997 Paris, heard that his parents had been shoved over the border into Poland.

The third secretary, after having what to the ra \u2014 to those of us in the foreign service can only call a meteoric rise, within two days he became first secretary. But he died. And that was then the beginning of the events of November ninth to 10\", the night of the ninth - 10 of November. He was held wi \u2014 in France. Subsequently he said he had killed vom Rath because of the postcard he had gotten from his parents, and so on. He then was subsequently turned over to the Germans. They were going to make a major propaganda trial for \u2014 in which there were two defendants, world jury and in an \u2014 in the form of Herschel Grynszpan, and they were going to try to prove that the shot of Paris 1938 was the same as the shot of Sarajevo some 20 years earlier, in other words, that they had caused World War II.

Did \u2014 found the Frenchman who had done a great deal of work on the same thing, and exchanged documents with him, and this was basically how it worked.

And actually I had my first chance to publish my work in 1952 or \u201953, when somebody in England heard about it, and I was offered that they would publish it, and in the State Department, being a very junior officer at that stage of the game, I had to \u2014 at that time it was necessary to submit manuscripts to a review committee. And after talking to these people, they said send it over, I sent it over to them. I had a document written.

Well, the document came back and it weighed about twice as much as it did before it went out because they put paper clips on all those places. Well, they had a paper clip almost on every other page. And what had \u2014 had happened was that the French Foreign Minister, Georges Bonnet, at that point was go \u2014 who had been the French Foreign Minister, he was going to testify for the Germans, or at least so the documentation said, was going to testify in this big trial against Herschel Grynszpan. Well, by this point, mis Interview with Gerald Schwab \u00b0 November 18, 1997 \u2014 Georges Bonnet had become \u2014 1950s \u2014 Georges Bonnet had become [indecipherable] to Franco-American Friendship Society, and it would just not do, saying that he had collaborated with the Germans.

And I was not Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Gerald Schwab \"\u00b0 November 18, 1997 terribly favorably well disposed towards him.

Secondly, whatever damage he did an \u2014 to Jews, which resulted in Crystal Night, I think he saved many more lives, or his act saved many more lives than the \u2014 the \u2014 the death that he caused; for the very simple reason that immigration of Jews from Germany and Austria started high in 1933, went down through 1937, early \u00b038, and then immediately after Crystal Night, immigration shot up. So a lot more people left Germany as a result. So in the end, he really \u2014 his act really saved lives, even though 110 - 115 people died in the immediate aftermath of Crystal Night.

Basically, what happened, Herschel Grynszpan avoided trial, or when the Germans were all ready there to put Herschel Grynszpan on the world stage, on trial \u2014 for this they had already invited, or were ready to invite the main newspaper people from around th-the \u2014 the neutral Europe. They \u2014 it was a big to-do \u2014 was to be a big propaganda trial. They had built a special courtroom [indecipherable] new telephone lines. It was to be a big to-do. And Herschel Grynszpan finally announced t \u2014 before \u2014 shortly before the trial was to take place, that he had killed vom Rath because vom Rath had made homosexual advances to him. Now, obviously homosexuality is not what major propaganda trials are made of, especially if the victim was supposedly involved. Well, when I finally did speak to hersh \u2014 to Moro-Giafferi in Paris, he \u2014 by the way, he was a\u2014 a man about five foot Interview with Gerald Schwab \u201d November 18, 1997 tall and five foot wide, who when I saw him the first time, greeted me with the statement that he had ever \u2014 only ever lost one man to the guillotine, and that was Bluebeard, and \u2014 which I said could be forgiven. And he was the number one criminal lawyer in France in \u2014 in the 20\" century; certainly the first half of the fu \u2014 20\" century, who had really been the lawyer for just about every \u2014 every major criminal trial, especially murder trials. Well, Moro-Giafferi smiled, laughed, and he says, well, let me explain where he got that idea. He says, when I initially took up his defense \u2014 and he had been hired, as I said, by Dorothy Thompson, who at that point was a major figure in American journalism, foreign correspondent in the days when foreign correspondents were still major figures, in \u2014 in the days when you didn\u2019t have instantaneous CNN coverage and so on. He said, I told \u2014 I asked Herschel why he had killed vom Rath, and he said, because had gotten this postcard, and what happened to his parents. And I explained that this matter \u2014 Moro-Giafferi speaking \u2014 I explained to him that French juries are not terribly friendly disposed towards political crimes. However, in a case of crimes of passion, French juries are much more lenient. And since there had been rumors, which I have certainly not been able to confirm, that vom Rath had homosexual tendencies, and had been rumors in town that he had visited homosexual places, he suggested that he may want to argue that there was a homosexual connection between the two. Well, according to Moro- Giafferi, Grynszpan rejected this out of hand. But then a few years later 100 Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18, 1997 remembered it, used it, and basically said to his cellmate, they\u2019re not going to make me \u2014 make another show trial out of me, they\u2019ve done enough damage already."

I do not consider myself a survivor. I know people who\u2019 ve been in L\u00e9dz; they\u2019re survivors.

It\u2019s that in-between, gray area. 110 Interview with Gerald Schwab November 18, 1997 That\u2019s one point. The second point 1s, I don\u2019t think that by virtue of being a survivor, you become an expert. No, quite frankly, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve made myself very unpopular already. I mean, I\u2019ve only attended one survivor group so far, and I\u2019ve made myself unpopular [indecipherable] by basically saying, just because somebody\u2019s a survivor, they don \u2014 does not mean that they\u2019re necessarily the best guides. So ve been accused since then of being an academic, or being too \u2014 too feeling that you have to have university degree and so on. Which isn\u2019t, of course, at all what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m just saying that, being the be \u2014 being the best guide, or a guide, it\u2019s interesting to be able to say to a group, this person lived through it, but that does not make that \u2014 that\u2019s important, but it doesn\u2019t make necessarily a \u2014 a qualified guide, or the best guide.
