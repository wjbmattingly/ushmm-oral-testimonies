Before we begin, for the camera, could you please tell us your name, when you were born and where you were born?",
            "answer": "Now, this thing of the name 1s something which is very confusing to very many people. My name is Michael, as you know, but this -- I don\u2019t want to make too many explanations, but anyhow just tell you how things are. Of course, our family comes from Germany from Sigmaringen, become the first -- the first king of Romania was a Hohenzollern, like my grandfather. But that ended with my grandfather. So we, in fact, do not have a family name in Romania. The family name of Hohenzollern is the origin, but that does not figure in any document or [indecipherable]. So that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s a bit confusing. So, the result 1s that we are called by our name and then add, of Romania. So that\u2019s how things are now. I was born on the 25\" of October, 1921, in Sinaia in a house which unfortunately doesn\u2019t exist any more because the o-original one burnt down, and it was rebuilt in 1954 - \u201956, the modern one. So that\u2019s about all for the introduction."

            "question": "Thank you, thank you. Your majesty, King Carol returned to Romania in 1930. You were nine years old. As I understand it, he took charge of your education and upbringing at that time. Can you talk with us about your relationship with your father in those years, and about the education that he organized for you? USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 2",
            "answer": "Well, two things here. One was my personal feelings and personal relationship with him, and the second part was aj -- was about the schooling. My personal relationship with him, to put it quite frankly, was not all the very best. I don\u2019t know how many people in United States and other countries are quite aware of what went on at that period. I don\u2019t want to say too strongly, but his private life is the one that -- that other people know more about. As you know, probably, that he had a connection with a certain person. As far as I could recollect what I was told, that started when I was about two years old. And in the 20\u2019s he left Romania and renounced his rights to the family and to the throne and to everything concerning Romania. So then when he came back in 1930, with a promise that this person was not going to come back with him. He finally did bring it back. So this situation got, well let\u2019s say practically out of hand. Because of this, my mother had to leave the country. So she left for good in 1932. So he had been away in the 20\u2019s, and my mother looked after me and gave me -- this is the way we [indecipherable] in Romania, you know, the first seven years at home. And that\u2019s something that normally remains with one for the rest of your life. And the life after, when my father came was so totally different that it just was very, very difficult for me to really take it. Well, that\u2019s one part, but the part of my education where I must say I was thankful to him because he had an idea, which 1s certainly very well. He made a special school for me inside the palace grounds, but in the [indecipherable] and we started with 12 boys in this school, each one of them from another part of the country, and from completely different social standings. From sons of simple peasants right up to sons of some industrialists, or intellectuals. So that helped me to, say to rub shoulders with a very good part of the Romanian people, even if at our age. And the teachers that we had were selected of some of the best run schools, especially one school. And then at the end of every school year, for about three weeks, we took off in a train, a special train with everybody in it, the professors and all of USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 3 us, in a different part of the country, we -- well, we took our lessons and courses in geography and history on the actual place where these things ac -- happened. So that is how I got to know my country, as much as possible, every little corner. I mean not every, it\u2019s very difficult, but a lot. Well, that has served me all through my life."

            "question": "You have just described a difficult relationship with King Carol. As you grew up in those years, did he talk with you and share his views about the political developments in Romania that he was confronting?",
            "answer": "I forgot again. I forgot to mention one thing, that although my mother was gone, [indecipherable] with something was rather painful for me because he only let me go to see her twice a year for three weeks in Florence, because she went to Florence. You know, she loved art so much, she f-found a villa there from 1932 and bought this place, and that\u2019s where I used to go and see her. And I can say that those six months in -- those few mon -- not few months, few weeks, I\u2019m sorry, few weeks at the time, I could say that that really charged my batteries, because otherwise it would have been really, if I can use the expression, absolute hell, sometimes. Now as far his political life and that, again, I don\u2019t think many people understand the situation at the time. I was never, at least not from him ever told what was going on. We learned a certain amount of political systems in school, but that was very dry, not in practice. So in all these events that f-finally led up to 1940 when he had to leave, I knew about them, of course, as a side line. But I had to try and find out by myself from various people, but I never got anything from him, from my father. And that was a terrible handicap when he left, because I was suddenly- found myself in a position without actually knowing all the details. I knew a lot of things that were going on, but not all the details on how everything worked. And that made life really difficult. USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 4"

Well, I could put it then that in the later part of the 30\u2019s, all of Europe was catching fire, see, so we were unfortunately in a place geographically, in a very, very difficult situation from the east, then the pressures from the Germans. We had alliances before with [indecipherable] many people knew, which when Hitler started bullying Europe, these alliances fell to pieces, unfortunately. So our part of Europe was left uncovered. We had maybe an advantage as a disadvantage because we have oil, and Hitler needed oil. We have the Danube [indecipherable] part of the Danube. I think he liked that part also. So the whole political situation was getting more and more complicated, more and more involved.

Now that did -- I must say it was very, very gratifying because whenever we met these young people [indecipherable] the warmth was extraordinary. Maybe I didn\u2019t quite understand why it was happening, what the reason for it was, but this I found out years later, because they realized what 1t was which was happening with my mother. And then you mentioned the point about the extreme right coming up, and that [indecipherable] influenced politically my father. Because I must say something here, which I don\u2019t want to be badly understood. But this person that was the cause of my mother\u2019s sadness, she was Jewish. Not that I have any particular feelings about that, but I have a feeling of what -- because of her, what happened with my mother. And those extreme rights were [indecipherable | the Nazi fifth column, you know, were anti-Jewish. That, of course, connected with my father, from his private life. Because during the 30\u2019s I must also admit that Romania progressed USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 6 enormously, if not politically, but economically. We have our money, the leu was practically at the level of the dollar in the end of the 30\u2019s. We had a standard of living like France and Belgium. So s -- some good did come, very much good. The trouble was the pol-political part that was not quite as it should have been. And this background of my father with these others is a complicated matter. And then of course, some political tendency, like in all parts of Europe, you know, we still have this -- how shall I put this, sort of a Byzantine influence, which is completely different to what we know in the west, politically speaking. That also didn\u2019t quite fit in with some of my father\u2019s ideas. And that\u2019s why, towards the end of the 30\u2019s, he formed a sort of a [indecipherable] we like to call 1t, which was not quite the thing to do, because when the real trouble started, we didn\u2019t have the old political parties to lean on. And then you got the situation that the extreme right started agitating out in the streets. Very complicated situation and he fell into that. Now, these are all things that I -- not studied, I'll say, but I found out many more details many years after. But at the time we were all very worried and I could not make out exactly what was going on in detail, because I wasn\u2019t told. I had to try and pick it up here and there. That\u2019s very much in a nutshell."

Only some things that sort of leaked out to me. First of all, the population around me also said we have to do something, we have to have some reaction, and there was no reaction from that point of view. It was quite obvious that we could not -- our army, or anybody else could have possibly stopped the Russians from coming in, but one should have don\u2019t it, at least a sort of symbolic something -- resistance, you call it. I remember there was a crown council [indecipherable] after the Russian [indecipherable]. It was a- I was not involved, but I know it was going on [indecipherable] in Paris, when one of the leading former politicians and professor -- maybe you know the name of Yargo, the historian. He was also not very friendly with my father, but anyhow he was there, because he was part of these people, so he came out of this meeting when I ha -- happened to be there. So he came straight up to me, I could see he was livid, in his face. And he just said a very strong word and he said, all that bunch is a bunch of traitors, and he walked off. And I -- I didn\u2019t understand what that was. Then after I found out that they got probably frightened or didn\u2019t have backbone or whatever it is, I\u2019m not quite sure, but they all advised that there\u2019s nothing to be done, we just have to comply, not to [indecipherable]. And that\u2019s one of the revolt of many of the people in Romania, is that we should have at least done something. But that\u2019s about how I got to know these things, USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 15 cause I was also [indecipherable] put in the sideline that I was also involved because it was the end of my schooling years, just before university, and I was having my final exam with four other boys, just about that same period.

            "answer": "Well, this was getting on, as I said before, when -- this is a little before the beginning of September, 1914, when he called back Antonescu. He made a prime minister, I think it was at the time. Accidentally, I happened to be just outside my father\u2019s office when Antonescu was in there. And when he came out, he saw me there, he came straight up to me and just said -- he -- he always had this funny habit of talking in the third person, you know, about himself. A-Awkward. So he came up to me and she said General Antonescu guarantees the situation. Then he left. Now what did he guarantee, what was the situation? I had no idea. So we come to the last part of it, this was on the fifth of September. On or before that, he had another audience with Antonescu USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 16 when Antonescu demanded that he give up nearly all his prerogatives to Antonescu. That just left him with a few -- put it little bit vulgar in a way, [indecipherable]. So on the fifth of September, we could hear shooting going on outside in the streets. The guards around the palace grounds were reinforced [indecipherable], I met him in the garden. But all that night we stayed awake, until about five o\u2019clock in the morning, and then a courier came from Antonescu with a letter. It was given to him, he opened it, and as he was reading I could vaguely see his color was draining. And he gave this letter to this man that was the gray matter behind him, a man called Ludverrano, just gave it to him, so that he read it also, and then he said to my father in French, because he used to talk a mixture of languages, he said, nothing more to do. So I was, you know, sort of shaken out of a haze, so I just said, well, what\u2019s this? So then they read it to me, in which Antonescu demanded his abdication because of all sorts of things, the political situation, this [indecipherable] one thing, my mother and so on, a whole mixture of things, and that -- then -- demanding his abdication. So that was that. That\u2019s at five o\u2019clock in the morning, we hadn\u2019t slept all night, and funnily enough there\u2019s a certain lady there, was a -- a -- present at this same thing. What she had to do with [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know, but anyhow. So I went to bed. And about nine o\u2019clock in the morning, the telephone rang. Now one of the ladies, she said, quick, get up, get dressed to take the oath. Now [indecipherable] slept for two hours. So that\u2019s what happened. I went back into the palace after I sort of woke up. And there\u2019s Antonescu, the patriarch, the president of the Supreme court, and one or two others. Horia Sima was not there. They said he was, but he wasn\u2019t. So I took the oath. And as my father had given him all those prerogatives, he put under my nose [indecipherable] so many people didn\u2019t understand how I can, but he made me, forced me to sign it, that Romania became a -- a national legionnaire state. You probably don\u2019t remember all that stuff. Well, this was, again, because of my non-information of what had USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 17 been going on. I did not quite understand what was going on really. So this situation was -- was again, kept quite out of [indecipherable]. Now one thing I must say that I was extremely grateful to Antonescu in all this unpleasantness that he did bring my mother back. And I consider this one thing, that if it wouldn\u2019t have been for her all those awful years, I don\u2019t know what I would have done, cause she -- she kept me going, in a way."

            "question": "How did you finally convince Antonescu not to deport more Jews?",
            "answer": "This 1s a -- it\u2019s a very long story, but I\u2019ll try and concentrate 1t somehow, because we were so distressed about going into Russia, because it was none of our business. I know the Romanians -- see, generations, you look at our history, all our troubles that we\u2019ve had here had always come from the east. So after the Russian revolution, slowly, slowly, all these years, we saw what was going on there, so this was certainly not in our mentality. So the fact to take back Tr- Transylvania and -- I mean Bessarabia and Buchovina was perfectly in agreement with that, but not any further. So, as things were getting from bad to worse, we\u2019d realized maybe before th-that this is going to end extremely badly. We got together in a clandestine -- I sort of picked the words not quite right, if you like, on the sly, with [indecipherable] and our group of some officers, to try and find a way to get out of the war. And this started already in the end of \u201942, it went all through \u00b043 and 44. That\u2019s how we had the -- well, there again you have Antonescu which is an awkward situation [indecipherable] with the Germans, doing everything with the Germans and at the same time he let people from these two parties go out to [indecipherable]. They let them even have, some of them that were in prison, radio transmitter. I-It\u2019s one of these situations that doesn\u2019t make sense, you know? But anyhow. So we sent some people out to try and contact the allies, that is the American and the Great Britain, to see what we can do. We probably don\u2019t want to go on with this [indecipherable] we have to get out. So these discussions and negotiations, recall they went on quite a long time til late \u201943 and \u201944, when Britain and America said that we won\u2019t discuss with you any more, because you\u2019re bringing the Communist Socialist group in this. We were all shocked about these things because what else we gotta do? USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 30 We have in Romania an -- an population of 20 million people, about. We had known, about 500 Communist members and another 300 sympathizers. Well, what do they got to do with what -- this, you see? We found that out much later, that 1t was the Soviet [indecipherable] that we should bring them in. So anyhow, they try and get [indecipherable], the -- Stalingrad happened. The situation was getting more and more dangerously acute. So we finally decided that we must find the right moment to tell Antonescu that he has to stop this war, or make an armistice. So if he doesn\u2019t want to, he\u2019s got to be put out. That\u2019s not very easy to say, but, you know, their job was going up and down inside Romania all the time. The Gestapo sitting here, next to the Royal Palace and the German commander too, recall [indecipherable]. It\u2019s not very funny, so to speak, you know? We had -- just when the worst part is happening, the Russian troops were coming close to our borders. The Germans funnily enough, they took two Panzer divisions from Romania and put them up in Poland. Maybe -- maybe you heard about all this. But that gave us a sort of a little breathing space, but we still couldn\u2019t do anything on our own completely, because we asked for help from the allies, which we didn\u2019t even get an answer from then. And that\u2019s because of the Soviets, we knew that after. So, to bring a very long story short, when the front collapsed in Bessarabia in the north, Antonescu came back from the front in the 22\u2122 or something like that, in August, through an indiscretion [indecipherable] we heard the telephone conversation, from his headquarters, saying that Antonescu is going back on the front on the 24\", I think was. Well our arrangement, which have already been done, was to call him on the 26\". We asked for strong American bombardment, for the air force to come here to hit certain spots where the Germans were, and then we hear [indecipherable] 24\". So in a great rush, we organized the [indecipherable] for the few troops that were here, just in case, and I called him, it happened to be the 23\" of August, and [indecipherable] specific date [indecipherable] just like USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 31 that. [indecipherable] came. And that is when everybody knows what happened. It\u2019s just that I'd like to specify one thing is that it\u2019s always been said that it was a coup d\u2019etat, but it -- I don\u2019t make coup d\u2019etats. I was the head of state, even if he was the [indecipherable] he was called. So it was perfectly on my prerogative to dismiss him. So, not a coup d\u2019etat, you could call it a political coup if you like, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing. And our greatest luck of all was first of all, surprise, because I\u2019m perfectly convinced that the Gestapo and the Secret Services here knew that -- exactly that we were plotting something. The very [indecipherable] informations on the political side, whereas what actually happened was the military side. And that they didn\u2019t know. And that was a complete surprise, it took them completely by surprise, and contrary to what very many people like to say, that Romania was liberated by the Soviets, which is absolute nonsense, excuse me the word, because we finish with the Germans in 48 hours, or four days [indecipherable]. When the Russians came here to [indecipherable] there wasn\u2019t single German left. We -- we managed to take too, 50,000 prisoners, including the top brass, right down to the last, here and in other parts around the town. The g -- the ra -- Americans bombed those places and that finished the resistance, and there were one or two small pockets north, near the oil fields, which were -- that went pretty quick. And that was all. And that was the greatest luck we had. I think we must have -- how shall I say? God\u2019s hand in all this, because you see, another little detail was that when we did this thing in 23\" of August, the Russian advance stopped, or slowed. We didn\u2019t react at the time, because we didn\u2019t understand, but later we understood what that is. I personally am convinced that -- you remember in Warsaw we had a uprising against the Germans, and the Russians stopped the advance, they let the Germans [indecipherable] the whole lot, and then they came in. Well, that\u2019s what they were hoping that was going to happen with us, only we had the luck to finish ourselves, without them. And that USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 32 disturbed them very much. But two little details which I can give you if you like, from their point of view is when -- in the palace it was, on the night of the 23\"\u00a2 of August, the Communist man came with -- who was known later on as [indecipherable], you probably know that. He was -- came as another name. But -- but Toscanu, who came in straight to me in the office where I was, and he looked at me and said, what have you done, you\u2019ve ruined us. So I -- I was speechless. I mean, we\u2019d been discussing this thing for months, and I go -- he tells me that it\u2019s ruined him. We understood that later, I\u20191l come to that. When the armistice -- what we call it here, was made up of a commission that went to Moscow. But Toscanu let -- leaked it out after that he went to see some important person 1-in Moscow. And he reports to him, he said, what have you done over there, you spoiled our business, something like that. The Romanian word is different. [speaks Romanian]. That\u2019s how they put it. So he said, well what -- what is [indecipherable] you know, it\u2019s scratching down a bit from the surface, he came [indecipherable] very slow there in the trucks in the northeast, waiting for this to happen, and surely they have that in mind, that the Germans were going to finish us and then they could come and do what they wanted straight away. But here is an very important thing, because I had the supports of the two main parties, the main ones, of course the other two also, but the strongest support of was the army. So, Antonescu was commanding the army. Well, when I gave the order, there wasn\u2019t one single defection. And that 1s something that a -- a -- what I heard would happen in Hungary. It seems that [indecipherable] gave the same order and nothing happened. They didn\u2019t listen to him. And I don\u2019t know you explained this. Is it the military discipline? Is it the oath they took? Was it because the commanders of the big units and all that, realized as much as us that the whole thing is finished, and that something had to be done? Or is it a combination of all that together? But anyhow, it worked, see. Not many people seem to understand quite all these underneath things USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 33 that were going on, cause all our work, political work so to speak, on the sly, that lasted well over a year. It came [indecipherable]. It was, of course, unpleasant for me in a sense, risking the whole thing one -- one side, but Antonescu were not an enemy of mine, he was an adversary, if you can call it like [indecipherable] I just put in English, because he behaved very unpleasantly with us. But anyhow, it was something I had to do, nothing to do with, like many people say, my revenge on Antonescu [indecipherable] that\u2019s absolute nonsense. I don\u2019t have that. That\u2019s not my mentality. But it was something that had to be done, and we did what we had to. And that was my duty towards my country [indecipherable] that\u2019s the main thing. With God\u2019s help, we managed. What happened afterwards, that is a completely different question. That\u2019s not our doing. So our hope for whoever hears this thing will have a better understanding of it."

The only one that had a team ready of course, was USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 37 the Communists [indecipherable]. So around four in the morning they came to the palace and said, we have to take care of this thing, because if nothing happens, and th -- the Prime Minister I named, General Sanatescu, maybe in a little moment of weakness, let them take him. So they took him to the seat of the Communist party in Bucharest, yeah, a place called [indecipherable]. Well, I was in -- already in the western part of the country, how could I have done that, see? Now, the Communists, as I was coming to say 1s that they took -- when the Russians came in here, of course they took him, Moscow -- Lubyan, I think, the prison. They kept him for two years, about. So what happened in the meantime, the Russian troops were here, they started messing up all the political parts, messing up what I was trying to do. [indecipherable] come in here and smashing door in my office, [indecipherable] on the table [indecipherable] forcing me to put Groza on, bringing in all the Communists in \u201945. So it\u2019s not -- th-things started to deteriorate, I wouldn\u2019t say very, very fast, but very clearly. So, in the meantime the population was getting sort of worked up, moderately at least. So in the two years that Antonescu was hir -- kept by the Russians, th-the people started to see that perhaps was better during Antonescu\u2019s time than it was now. Which, in fact, it was, unfortunately, except for the war. So when Antonescu got back and put on trial, all these people were sort of said, after all, he\u2019s done something, these people, look what they\u2019re doing, see? On that I\u2019m convinced that the way they did this trial, which was a farce, all of it fixed beforehand like the Nazis used to do also, like in Russia. It was done I thi -- I -- felt there -- m-maybe I think of it now, to -- to bring down my image. See -- you see, in that time I don\u2019t know -- want to know everything that\u2019s [indecipherable] not with the thing behind it. Now what, constitutionally speaking, my [indecipherable] my situation was that no act is valid that I would sign without the counter- signature of the minister. That is in our constitution because it\u2019s the minister that countersigns USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 38 that is responsible, not me. So, when they came out with the sentences -- now, the Minister of Justice at the time, Patrascanu came [indecipherable] saying -- asking for pardon, which Antonescu did not do. With -- his lawyer did it, but not him. So on, and then he said no, no, no, one or two years. So constitutionally speaking, what will be my position? I could refuse that and sign something else, but nothing will have happened. That\u2019s one thing. And the second complication was that -- that there were Soviets behind it. I\u2019m absolutely certain [indecipherable] American. So even if anybody would have wanted to [indecipherable] this thing, 1t would not have been possible. And that\u2019s how it happened. And the way they did that was -- excuse me the word, was absolutely disgusting. Cause after all, he was a patriot, he loved his country, he tried to defeat [indecipherable] and so on. He -- politically he did it for the -- my question was what could we do? [indecipherable] But his feelings were the Romanian [indecipherable]. Although he was [indecipherable] things that went on, still. And the way this was done was -- was not a trial, they were murderers, to put it quite frankly, and was very distressing for me and my mother and all the others, ever after what we been though. And the way he ended, I didn\u2019t like it, although probably something had to be done, you couldn\u2019t avoid that, you know. Not quite like that, you know? No matter what he did and all that, he is still [indecipherable] you know, they did [indecipherable |"

I don\u2019t mean to be unfair, misunderstanding, but we did not get the proper backing and help from the western allies. We know [indecipherable] percentages.

[indecipherable] and the thing happens as [indecipherable] you see events, you start making up your mind. Make decisions, or have ideas which are not actually based on the full knowledge of what\u2019s what. And that is what I\u2019ve been trying all these years to sort of bring out. To stop looking at the surface of things, which are bad or good, whatever it is. What -- the point it, why have we got to a certain point if you don\u2019t USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0420 41 understand what\u2019s happened underneath.

And then the rest should follow. You know, they say sometimes that it\u2019s a very -- how most people cut the branches [indecipherable] off, but a very, very few that look at the underneath of the -- at the roots of it. And that\u2019s what I wish so much, with all this modern world now and the people that -- that -- you know, everything\u2019s [indecipherable] all over the place now, to -- to try and understand why did certain things happen, and the tragedy of the whole -- what will you say, let\u2019s say in this part of Europe, a hundred million people here.
