            "question": "Could you tell me briefly about your family, and about your home life in Hamburg?",
            "answer": "I was born to a physician and his wife. We had a very assimilated home life. I was the youngest of four children. I went to high school, as far as I could get in Germany. It was all under the Whymar Republic, which of course, 1933, was taken over by Hitler, and my schooling, at least my formal schooling, came to an end. And at that time, one had to think slowly, about preparation for leaving Germany. I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult Germany, and the most uneasy time for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for Germany, all around. Vesters, strikes, and on the whole, you are looking how to create a future. My first job, as I always wanted to be a social worker, from my seventh year on, I became a secretary in a Jewish girl\u2019s orphanage. And at that time, it became clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly of them Polish orphans, would be sent back to Poland. It was partly my job to help prepare the children for a life that we really couldn\u2019t foresee, but it certainly meant separation, separation from the place they knew, as well as if they had relatives, separation from relatives, into the unknown. I have done that about a year, and then decided to better learn England, prepare --  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I went to England, and tried to learn shorthand and typing. I never did very well. I worked in household, but then a letter came from a colleague in Hamburg, telling me that there were still so many children that could possibly go out -- correction, not so many, but some. And I decided, against anybody\u2019s advice, to go back to Germany. And I stayed in Germany for about a year, and again, helped children, also worked for the German Jewish community. It\u2019s interesting that even though we had very assimilated, from the very beginning, my 50 year career in social work, was almost all in Jewish social work. I prepared for my immigration, which was very difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we don\u2019t have to go into. The secret police at one time got hold of me, which was not a pleasant experience. They took my passport away, and eventually I got out of Germany, because one of my English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me a fake letter that he was going to marry me, and I would become an English citizen, and set a date for our marriage. And at that point, I got my passport back, and left in a hurry. Again, I stayed in England for a very short time. I didn\u2019t work. By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigrated to England, and so it was a bit of a family reunion. It\u2019s all not [indecipherable] clear in my memory, but somewhat like it. And my brother from America, where I als -- also had a brother, came. He was a lawyer here, working for the office of Price Administration, he must have been the levelator. Anyhow, he picked me up, and we came together to America. And it was a little funny story when I arrived here. People who thought I\u2019d gone into the wilderness in America, my aunts, etcetera, had given me, of all things, tea kettles. So when I arrived here, and the customs opened my stuff, I was surrounded by the tea kettles, and the customs official looked at me and said, \u201cGolly, what do you want to do? Trade with the Indians?\u201d That\u2019s the beginning of America."

            "answer": "No, we were very assimilated. Yes, proforma -- it\u2019s a harsh word, but we did observe Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Actually, I still do it, even though my life had gone up and down in between. And we were an upper class, very well known family. And what you did was always being looked at by others. But, I should mention my mother -- and I\u2019ve inherited that from her, liked to help people, and she always volunteered. And she had what she called office hours in our house, and she would counsel people. And as a child of seven, I was sitting under the table, listening to these stories, and that\u2019s why I decided I wanted to help. And another -- and that\u2019s the last story of my past, we had a big house, and I had a governess, as ever -- anybody had to, had a little money in Germany. And I was always afraid when the governess had the day out, and I was alone in the big house. So my father, to comfort me one day, bought me a big, chocolate teddy bear, and said that, \u201cHe\u2019Il keep you company.\u201d I didn\u2019t want chocolate bear, I wanted somebody to talk to. So I cried. So my father, who was a little impatient, said, \u201cWell, you are but spoiled. There are many poor children who have no teddy bears.\u201d I said nothing, and I thought. Day before, we had taken a walk, and my governess had said, \u201cLet\u2019s walk slowly here,\u201d no, correction again, \u201c\u2018let\u2019s walk fast, because this is where the poor children live.\u201d So, I thought, teddy bear, poor children. So during afternoon, I ran around, back to that neighborhood with my chocolate bear, and when I saw a little girl that looked poor to me, pressed the chocolate teddy bear into her arms. Once later, my mother was playing bridge, and one of her partners said, \u201cOur neighborhood is changing, because an absolutely strange girl walked up to my little daughter,  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

My mother left a little later than I did, to England, which she lived -- let\u2019s see, she left after Crystal night, and only got out because my Dutch brother-in-law came from Paris to take her out with the help of the Dutch consulate. He came, and he was politically quite on the left, and had brought quite a few fake Dutch passports, and got out two or three well known writers, who were in concentration camp.

            "answer": "Cause New York is overwhelming if you come from Germany, and my family -- I had an aunt here, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to me, but I didn't fit into that type of society at all. I looked European, English was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social Democrats. They were very nice to me, but I didn\u2019t want to play the role of a poor relative, that\u2019s just not in me. And I had a Quaker friend in Philadelphia, who was a teacher of music. And we had been through a lot in Hamburg together, we had gone to school together. So I phoned her, and said, \u201cEtta, please get me a job, any job.\u201d And she came through. And I lived in the house of a lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta also had a room. And I did a little a-around the house. I\u2019m really not very well trained in that respect, but they were very good pe -- were actually lovely people. I took a little bit care of children. And money I didn\u2019t have.

And he gave me a chance just try for a scholarship in a very good American college in Swarthmore, which has helped me for the rest of my life. And they again were very nice, because they believed me. I had my examination for the university in Germany, which I didn\u2019t have, but I said I had lost it. And I could make up for it in an examination, I passed with very good grades, and so I got through Swarthmore in two years. That, of course, was a big help, because then, during those two years, I used my furniture, rented an apartment with borrowed money, and sublet rooms to other students. And that way, I got through college. I just missed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I\u2019m really angry about, because I had the cooking to do for -- and I had it easy because I majored in English, which was not in English literature, but I minored in German, so it meant I could concentrate on my major.

I was dead sure, if I\u2019d ever become a citizen, I would go and try to help rebuild. I felt guilty. I was safe, and my friends were not. I was in close contact with the Quakers, who were the only organization, I believe, who could, at that time, get into Germany, even could -- and get into the camps. And they, at that time, were starting their so-called refugee section, and they ask me to work in it, and to set it up. And so I knew particularly about Germany, that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to camps, but if I\u2019m very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not in my memory as the overwhelming experience it was, becu -- I think like, human beings, and young ones, you think about studying, about your boyfriends, about whatever the day brings.

It came back more and more when I -- at the refugee section, as my daily bread, and had to write and answer letters from Germany, people pleading for so-called affidavits. And while I was working with Quakers, I was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all things, going to Iowa. Now, imagine this German Jewish girl, with fairly good English, but still not -- still the the English English. I was sent to farmers, who in their turn had rarely heard of Jews.

And I spent one difficult year in a state hospital near Sikesville, Maryland. And that was a -- hospital of about 3,000 patients, and five physicians. And there I became very much aware of Europe and it\u2019s difficulties, because the majority of our five physicians had come from Europe, and had escaped Hitler.

            "answer": "What, of course, I remember first of all, was that I was suddenly an enemy alien. I\u2019d been thrown out of my country, to come to America, and find myself an enemy alien. I could not have a camera, I could not have a short wave radio. And for every trip, I had to get permission from Washington, which means my brother, who was in Washington, working for the government, I could only go and see him with special permission, which I got. I didn\u2019t go too often, but he came to me. I -- these are individual things. My outstanding best friends at that time, were the director of the labor relations board in Philadelphia, and his wife. And they were ardent pacifists. And on the day the we -- war broke out, they asked me, \u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d And impulsively, I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad that,\u201d -- now this is when America got into the war, -- \u201cthat America is getting into the war, because that will give the allies more power.\u201d And they looked  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Do you want that to go on for eternity?\u201d So we had a very long discussion. We stayed friends afterwards, and we both kept our opinions. They were pacifists. I had been a pacifist for a good time of my life. As a matter of fact, when in Germany, I was the youngest member of the [indecipherable] for Human Rights. So, that will always be my interest. But, I changed when Hitler came, and I gave up the pacifist, I just couldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s my outstanding memory. And then, of course, it was the anxiety, I couldn\u2019t get letters from Europe. I had heard so much about the first World War, because I was born in the beginning. But when I was five and six, the memory was still very strong, my parents, and [indecipherable]. So, I knew what was going to happen, and I also had a ration book during the war, but I suppose everybody had it. I don\u2019t know, I was in an institution, in that camp -- no, in the state hospital, and we got very little to eat, but I realized it was still much more than they had in Europe. And then, of course, I had very strong sympathies for the allies, and once in awhile, I got letters smuggled from England, or from my sister in France. I suffer always for some contact, somebody asked me this question. I don\u2019t remember if the letters were censored or not. I don\u2019t think I ever was out of contact with my mother. I looked -- I kept my mother\u2019s address, but not the war time, one, so I -- I really don\u2019t know. I remember how I threw my camera into a river, because I wasn\u2019t permitted to have it. Why I didn\u2019t give it to an American colleague, I don\u2019t know. And I -- I did not have too many Jewish friends while I was in Philadelphia. I had roo -- Jewish room mates, but one was American, and as I implied, very much on the left. The other was also from Germany, and very assimilated. And so certainly we were interested, we read the papers, and we hoped that war would be over. But we also tried very hard to live from day to day. Now, this changed for me in 1943 or four. I\u2019m really not good with figures. When the War Education asked me -- War  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And Oswego was a camp, it was a former army camp that had barracks, and awful ones. And there\u2019s barbed wire around. It always amazes me, the only time I personally have been in the camp, with barbed wire, and real barracks, was in America. Because I was always insisted on living right in the camps, because you can\u2019t be of help if you are billeted in a hotel outside. And these were a thousand refugees, who had been in - yeah, it was called concentration camps, but were not extermination camps, in Italy. One was called Perramonte, just for your information. And the refugees, the majority, by far, were Jewish. I think we had about five non-Jewish people, but we had some. We had some Ukrainians. And Dr. Ruth Gruber, who was the assistant to all [indecipherable] acres, who was an -- high in the government, had been sent to Europe to select from different camps, a thousand refugees. These had been invited by President Roosevelt, with the idea that Italy was starving, and he would at -- at least take a thousand mouths out. Well, it\u2019s really not a very bright idea, but it helped a thousand people. And they were invited to -- the whole time, they didn\u2019t know if they could stay in this country. And what that means psychologically, you can\u2019t do it -- can\u2019t imagine. Actually, one was sent back because he was insane. The others eventually stayed here, in \u201945. And I\u2019ve met them over the -- my career in social work, all over the place. And that was my first camp ex- no -- well, the other was a vacation camp, this was a camp with all the difficulties of a camp. People not having any privacy. Some people died. One person died shoveling snow. The administration was blamed for that. I got an [indecipherable] to later camp life. The food was always [indecipherable], it\u2019s always in camps. People have to have an outlet for all their feelings, so they fight for food. We had a few birth. We had a hospital run by a Jewish laf -- doctor, who was supervised by Dr. Ruth, who had already an MD in America. In the hospital, I had an operation, and I remember my refugee doctor very well. However, it went all right. It was an ope  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I stayed in that camp, almost through the end. I think I left a month before. People eventually got the permission to stay. Most of them came to New York.

So, through her, it was natural that I met other Quakers. And I met a professor of social work, Hetta Calls, from Czechoslovakia. She was a professor of social work in Bryn Mawr, and for quite some time I stayed in her house, and she was a president at that time, or the founder of this refugee section, and she knew that I knew typing, a little shorthand. And she introduced me as her secretary to the American Friend Service Committee in Philadelphia. And I was very lucky, I got to know Rufus Jones, and Kelly, and learned to loved, and admired a lot. And met my first -- I was a refugee of- myself at that time, really in the camp. What I had to do as a secretary was really mostly writing letters, trying to search for people, trying to get affidavits, trying to talk to lawyers. A little bit helping people to adjust.

            "question": "This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York. This is tape number two, side A. On the last tape, we were speaking about your time in Oswego, and -- where you were working with refugees, and now perhaps you can tell me what you did after you finished your time in Oswego.",
            "answer": "When I came back from Oswego, I had moved from Philadelphia to New York, and I was waiting for papers to clear, to go eventually to Europe. I went back to a job I had had before, and that\u2019s the juvenile court. I was always interested in working with delinquent youngsters -- so- called delinquent. And I worked for what\u2019s called Youth House for boys, and later for Youth House for girls. Again, as a psychiatric social worker, taking histories this time for the judge to have -- make decisions what to do with a youngster, send him home, go to placement, or whatever was indicated. I had done that early in the game, I forgot which year. I did it again when I came back from Oswego, and that was by the middle of \u201945. And I did it until the end of \"46, when I went, with the Joint Distribution Committee, to Europe. I had been in touch with the Joint a long time before. Actually, \u2019'd known about it all my life, cause my family was very instrumental in it\u2019s creation. And the Joint was one of the agencies working in Europe after the war. The other was UNRRA. Those were the two main agencies. Of course, every religion had it\u2019s representation. The Joint, and the U.S. Army, and the UNRRA was p-part of it, were really the most constructive factors in rebuilding. I am very aware that they are under a lot of criticism, but having been on the spot, I can say that they performed a miracle. Europe at that time was chaos, people not knowing where they came from, not knowing where they were going, practically not knowing who they are. The Joint and UNRRA [indecipherable] really established  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

There have been so many camps, and they were different in the different zones. You had the British zone, and you had the American zone. I can\u2019t remember if they had a Russian zone, but they had three zones. And em -- each zone had it\u2019s country director, and then there was a director for all the work, in Paris. He was in charge of it all. I know that when I came over, I was first going to Paris, to be oriented toward what was expected to me -- of me, and to be assigned to a country. I did not know when I left here where I would go. I assumed it would be Germany or Austria because of the language. To my great surprise it was Italy. And my much bigger surprise came, I went to Rome, because the capital always was the center where the Joint worked out of, and I spent a few weeks in a sort of reception camp called Genechita, City of the Movies. It was the Hollywood of Italy. And that was a camp for every refugees that had been picked up. Every nation, and wi -- religion. Men, women, children. I don\u2019t know how many. To me it seemed thousands, it may not have been. And that camp, I remember as a nightmare. If you ask me who administered it, I do not know any more. I know it had no individual rooms. There were partitions between the families, sort of made of sheets -- bedsheets, where you could hear every noise from the neighboring bed, which means your private life was open to the children, open to each other. It may be part because it was my first real camp, but I was absolutely overwhelmed. The second day I was there, there was a rumor that a Chinese had killed his wife. If that was so or not, I have no idea, but everybody talked about it. That was, in my memory, the most primitive camp, but as I say, I had just arrived, I had no basis of comparison. In a way it was good, because every other camp seemed like -- not paradise, but at least not like hell. And I must say, I don\u2019t remember anything of the beauty of Rome, which I had not seen before. I only remember this miles of humanity, badly dressed, hungry, cold -- it was winter, I came so -- in February, I think. And --  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I got on long train ride. It still was right after the war, and people always forget, your trains weren\u2019t running. Italy itself had no food. The people were under the impression still of the war. Yes, they had won the war, oh, Italy didn\u2019t here -- take it back, I\u2019m not sure Italy won. But they were -- everything was gray and gray. And it took us very, very long to get from Rome to Milano, which usually takes a night. Sleeping [indecipherable] didn\u2019t work, it was -- Italy was just a country in which a war had raged. And one shouldn\u2019t forget, it wasn\u2019t only all Displaced Persons, it was all the Italians themselves. You were hungry, and tired, and had no work. When I arrived in Milano, this rehabilitation center, being a former hotel, looked like absolute luxury. I did not stay in the place. I think that had had reasons, because it was tuberculosis all over the place. We had, as far as I remember, no children. Some younger people. I remember a young woman, perhaps in her early 20\u2019s, from Yugoslavia, who had survived with her parents, and they had gone through hell, and she had ch -- tuberculosis, and died, very much at the beginning of -- and I never forget it, I can still paint her face. And that -- it\u2019s really difficult to talk about, because it\u2019s a double experience. Here you had survivors faced with death again. Now, what that meant to them, I can\u2019t imagine, I can only feel a little bit in my fingertips. And still you had the same political groups fighting each other, that was the Hungarians and the Poles. All Jewish people, but different ideas, different religious traditions. Being angry at the world. This is [indecipherable] people. I remember three of young men who were not even 20 -- I mention that because you, at that age, could survive, and then in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s. You hadn\u2019t many old people survive, and you hadn\u2019t many children survive. Not in these camps. We had a doctor from South Africa, who was the M.D. director of the camp, and we had Displaced Persons physicians. We had about three physicians. Now, either ask me how  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Too long ago to ve -- to remember figures. And, what perhaps has to be mentioned 1s that was the time where streptomycin was a rarity. The doctors practically only had lermotorax to work with, which was a much more complicated procedure, nobody [indecipherable] it could be dangerous. Also, for the TB doctors, they had to stand very long. This is procedure, and I know once or twice somebody fainted. And streptomycin, we always had to get on the Black Market. Now, this was the center of the Black Market. You exchanged streptomycin for either coffee or cigarettes. And the accepted -- accepted currency were cigarettes. And -- and the other thing was, there was something -- the army run co -- called the PX, which was like a shopping center, with a very low prices. And we had, as American, or an English workers, we could buy there, and we could exchange. There are also two currencies. There was green dollar, and oh, what was the other called? A script. A script, as far as I remember, you couldn't take out of the country, I don\u2019t remember it. The green dollar was much better, and you could get anything for a green dollar, from two dollars to [indecipherable] dollars, there was no rule or regulation. And there was a fight to get food, because the Germans had no food themselves. And all these things are of course, forgotten. Now, one of these stories -- oh, I don\u2019t know how many, have been in articles I have written over the years. They are not very new. I\u2019ve told them before. But one can\u2019t duplicate them, I can\u2019t invent new ones. And one which shows you the difficulty with food. Jewish holidays, of course, played a very, very big role. And these were the first holidays in freedom. So, my people in the -- I call it camp, it\u2019s really abcenter, wanted to be like home, and have geese and chickens for Rosh Hashanah. Now how to put loose geese and chickens, when all I had was the canned goods the Joint hand me? Now, many, many of my people weren\u2019t even used to that. So, the only thing to do was to ask if any of the DP\u2019s would be able to look after This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460 27 live chicken and geese, and there was somebody. So then I went to the mayor of this little village, and asked if I could have some, I would bargain against canned peas, and stuff like that. Well, they let me have some. So, in our DP Center, we had guk, guk, guk, guk. And they were a big excitement, we had them for a few months. We had to feed them, they were like everybody else, starving. And the whole group, of course, was very much interested. And Rosh Hashanah came. We had a cook who was German and not Jewish, so he cooked the beasts, and when he was cooking them, to get the feathers out, he used boiling water, and when he did that -- you know what a mushkia is? The Jewish [indecipherable] overseers, which we would have foster, came in, and he looked at it and said, \u201cTrayfa, no good, no good. You can\u2019t eat them. Now tell your community what happened.\u201d I said, \u201cWe m -- have to find a way out. This means life to them.\u201d Well, I had an Orthodox part, a community, they all wanted to go right to America, and the un-Orthodox want to go what was then Palestine. Now, the un-Orthodox said, \u201cWe can eat -- eat it.\u201d The Orthodox says, \u201cTrayfa, trayfa, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d Then the Orthodox committee came to me and said, \u201cYou know, you have to ask a miracle rabbi.\u201d A-Again this gentleman assimilated [indecipherable]. Well, eventually, I found a miracle rabbi in a camp in Austria. Now, try to phone, in occupied Germany after the war from one country to another. I had to call General Clay\u2019s office, who was the commander of all of the German zones, and I got some soldier who thought I was utterly nuts. \u201cWhat do you want, chicken? Buy some chicken.\u201d \u201cExcuse me, I have to,\u201d -- \u201cAll right, you get clearance.\u201d I get clearance, I call for the wonder rabbi, and I get him. And he says, \u201cFirst of all, are you a Jewish daughter? Well, this is a very difficult question, I have to think about it. Would you call back in two hour?\u201d I said, \u201cBut the things have to be cooked. I have no time to waste, I have excited people.\u201d Call back. So I go through the whole thing again, get the same soldier to Clay\u2019s office, who just -- who just shakes  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then I get the answer, it\u2019s a little difficult to translate from the German Jewish. \u201cIf the geese and the chickens were boiled in water that was higher than the boiling mark, then they are trayfa, but if that was lower, if was water right out of the faucet, then they can be eaten.\u201d So I was on very good terms with a young DP camp director, who had had a baby. I said to him, \u201cPlease, you bathed your baby this morning in hot water from the faucet?\u201d He knew exactly what I was doing, said, \u201cYes, Miss Tarenberg, I did.\u201d I went back, called my two committees together, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the answer from the [indecipherable] rabbi, we can\u2019t go any higher, and we are going to eat the animals.\u201d And we did. But these stories, once in a lifetime. Bad food is 1n all institutions, one of the main cause for trouble, because people don\u2019t have so many things to fight about, and they let out all their hostility, their fear, their anxiety, on food. And I have had so many debates about food, you can\u2019t imagine. In the three centers I worked in. So that was part of it, but the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with the families, some were all over the place, if they were alive, was really unforgettable. On a more cheerful note, we had our first wedding in camp. And that again 1s a story, how overly sensitive people are under those conditions. This young couple wanted to go Aliyah beth -- you know what it is? To Palestine. And when they married -- at that time, of course, we had to create a wedding dress. Well, the Joint had sent us lots and lots of material for cottons, and out of the cotton material, we made dr-dresses for the whole group. And in a actual over-identification, I made myself a dress, too. We must have looked like a flower garden. Anyhow, when they married, I wanted to give them a wedding present. You don\u2019t have very much to give, and anyhow, money seemed to be the most important. Well, I took some lira and put them in an envelope, which was from my office, it was a little torn, and the young lady first said -- didn\u2019t say anything. And much later came to me and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t thank you, because I was annoyed,  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0460 29 because you didn\u2019t take care enough to put that money in a nice envelope, and write something nice on it. We are taking that money, not for our personal gratification, but we\u2019ll give it to Aliyah beth.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, if that gives you satisfaction. I\u2019m sorry. I surely didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d But that\u2019s typical for the over-sensitivity. That was a Greek girl from Saronica. And I found them a particularly sensitive group. I don\u2019t know as much as [indecipherable] that I know about the other European countries. But they are a very sensitive group to work with. We had quite a few. We also had a supposedly Sephardic Jews -- Jew, from Greece somewhere, who turned out not to be Jewish at all. He was a Turk, and when a -- when he got angry, took a saber out -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber, but he ran away, end of story. As I say, the interesting thing is that all that I remember so well, probably because I felt guilty that I couldn\u2019t do more to help them, that they all have forgotten the bad part, and of course, compared to the concentration camp, this at least meant some security, but that they didn\u2019t know to which country they would go. I remember one woman who had a utterby breakdown, with good reason. She had waited and waited for her husband, eventually located him in Poland, but he was married to another woman, he had thought she was dead. And -- help. And then, a young lady who really -- later in this country, when I met her, by chance in the street, became a friend of mine, had marched all the way from Romania, that was days and nights. And she was young, she was almost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18, and almost all her family had been killed, but one brother who had gone to Palestine. And she tried violently to make an adjustment once she\u2019 II come to America. Had bad case of TB. They all had TB, but this was one of the worst. And I looked after her, I s -- sat up at night with her, etcetera, etcetera. You do what you think has to be done. It\u2019s not always social work, what\u2019s [indecipherable] happen. And one day we got a cable from Palestine that her brother had died in the war against England. Now I had the nice job to  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And of course, she practically lost her mind, and so for quite a few nights I stayed with her in her room, and played, as well as I could, mother figure, but -- and she never got over, not even today, is happily married, but she had to tell all her past. Many didn\u2019t talk about their past, but she felt she want to describe the halls, and there were many children. It was a very religious home. And so every day, we set aside a certain hour for telling. And then I left, and I didn\u2019t hear about her. I thought of her sometimes. I had a picture, with a very nice dedication. And really, 40 years went by, and I -- I\u2019m here in Forest Hills in a street, in front of a store, looking at some hats. And a very tiny voice behind me said, \u201cAren\u2019t you Miss Tarenberg?\u201d That was Celie, that\u2019s her name, Celia. And she had come to this country, had gotten TB again, was in a TB sanitarium. Had married, happily. Her husband died. Had married again, living quite near here. Has two wonderful children, and is a very good business woman, which I\u2019d never thought. Had [indecipherable] in business. We see each other once in awhile. It\u2019s gone -- I never [indecipherable] something, I cannot identify this [indecipherable]. You find that in DP camps, people became either very, almost fanatically religious, or said a God who lets concentration camps happen. It\u2019s very difficult to say something to either. But I found that over and over again. And it\u2019s interesting that the stories I got at that time, went riva -- really well, just about liberated from camps, were quite different than what you get today. I remember, I think out of my personal sy-system, I remember so well a young man who was very close to his father, they were very religious, and he had seen his father jump into the fire with a Torah in his arm. You don\u2019t hear that any more. But I must say, I almost cracked up on that one."

There are such things that one can perhaps a  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Some people who had a somewhat guilty conscience, had to justify the way. There was much more things that had to be hidden at that time. I remember one man was so upset because he had stolen potatoes. And well, there were much more serious crimes that had been done. And yes, after the people trusted you, you would have the conflict that you could have saved somebody, but you ran, or whatever it was. I always have difficulty with some of the things, because you cannot document them, you have to trust my memory, and some of these stories, I don\u2019t even mention, because I have no way of showing they really happened.

I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a beautiful city, and they were very surprised the taxi drivers, that I speak German without an accent. I could relate to the young people, who really had nothing to do with all this. But when I saw somebody over 55, or so, I curled up. I didn\u2019t know what you did during the war. I looked at our old house. It was a funny feeling. But something nice. When I was born, my father planted a pine tree in our garden, and by God, it survived. It was nice. I always said I am a survivor, so -- and people have gone back in g -- much greater numbers to Poland. They hate Poland much more than I hate Germany.

And it was good for the ego, I think, it -- then, in this country, nobody wanted to hear about these stories. And now, it has become very fashionable.

They overstress the value of education. They put so much pressure on, that the young people can\u2019t live up to it. But they haven\u2019t had it, and here they had the chance, they have to take it. All right, when the time comes that a 18 year old wants to move out of the house. You can\u2019t go -- leave us. Everybody has -- else has left us. Then the young person feels guilty. She wants to live her own life, or he, and on the other hand -- I\u2019ve had many, many interviews around that. Around differences in religious activities. And it works both ways, I have -- I had parents who were practically agnostics, and children were fanatic [indecipherable]. Then the adjustment difficulties. Young people here certainly live different type of lives than parents have in Czechoslovakia. And that depends on which community they live in, but now -- when I first came here, I preached about the necessity that we should know more about DP camps, because they were the catch all. And I was very mad when I heard of the big conference, that some of my former colleagues are, who were very nice, and I couldn\u2019t go, which annoyed me. But -- not really. And then I started to think, the second generation is in their 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s now. They must have something in common, and usual a social agency isn\u2019t really geared to this type of problem. They could probably best help themselves. And I helped them to come together in groups. Now, we have the English transport children is one group. Then we have the hidden children is another one. There\u2019s a [indecipherable] which name I\u2019m -- I really don\u2019t know which. Federation of Children [indecipherable]. Now, unfortunately, they all compete with each other. But they do good work, they all bring out the monthly newsletter. And that was very nice. I always get them from all of them, and I give them to students I share the contact with, et-etcetera. And the English transport children were having a question where you can ask for relatives of friends. And I remembered that my mother, in England, as a volunteer, was connected with a hostel where children from  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And in a small place in Yorkshire, which I had almost forgotten, I was up there a few times. And really for the fun of it, I wrote to the editor, and said, \u201cI wonder if any of your subscribers will remember an old lady in Italy, who ladled out the soup for lunch every day in the hostel.\u201d And lo and behold, I got three answers, after 60 years. From somebody in Canada, somebody in South Africa, and somebody in Maine, and they remembered my mother, etcetera, my brother. So it still goes on, you know?

And I went to the Joint, and said -- I said I\u2019m back in Europe, I might just as well work, and they assigned me to Germany. They sort of were quite glad to have me back at the time. So, that\u2019s how I started in Bashkimine. Passau came a little later, but I had them both together, and then I was stationed in Munich.

And we had a person in charge of our own district, from England. And there was -- there were meetings forever, and this was in November, this I remember. And it was a very foggy night, and I had a young Czech driver, who meant very well, but didn\u2019t know too much about driving. And we couldn\u2019t find the house of this English commander. And we drove down a mountain, and where he thought was a street, 1t was a mountain going down, and the Jeep rolled over, and over, and over. Have a happy ending. And I don\u2019t know much what happened after, I was first taken, I\u2019m told, to the house of the commander. I was unconscious, and then eventually taken to the Passau hospital. There I woke up, in a German hospital, which was all I needed, and with a big, s- swollen head, and it turns out that I had a fracture of the skull. Luckily, my driver came the next day. Nothing had happened to him, and he wanted to apologize. It\u2019s very often the person who sits next to the driver. And I was in that hospital for months. I think it was March that I got out. I was very lucky, I had no le -- nothing left over. My eye 1s a little affected, but for weeks I couldn\u2019t see, I thought I would never see again. And it was not Christmas, was some holiday, I know people were very nice to me, and a Catholic priest always came and gave me the Last Rites, and I could really take my choice. And eventually I was asked, where would -- did I want to go for a convalescent leave. And I chose Merrano, because I knew doctors there, and I knew the place, and I didn\u2019t want to go to a German German place. And in Merrano, I met my future husband, who was a doctor there.

Certainly America, because it was so rich, and Germany because it had handled them so badly. As far as the camps, they were both located in pleasant surroundings. I think the kooven ital -- Italy had more contact with the population of Merrano, than the group in Passau had with the inhabitants of Passau. The problems were pretty much the same, health, where to go to, how to handle one\u2019s past, and what the future will bring. This is an oversimplification, but by now, some of the details have slipped my mind. What is very much on my mind is the fact that many of the people who are still alive, of my rehab center population, are in their late 50\u2019s, I think up the end of 60, and I wonder how they will handle the process of aging, which is something that affects all people, but I have a suspicion that it affects them differently. From my work with survivors in this country, I have seen that they pretty much go to a second -- through a second immigration when they get older. Certainly the language that they have handled rather well, through ha -- the middle years, gets to be slightly problematic again. I find that older people, including me, are apt to count money in their mother tongue, which they haven\u2019t done for years. Also, of course, living in a city, a big city like New York, where you haven\u2019t gone to school, or know anybody from the olden days, makes you doubly lonely. Loneliness, of course, comes with aging, but as a survivor, you sometimes ask yourself, what do you survive for? I have often heard complaints by survivors that there is nobody they went to school with, no neighbors that know the streets they have walked in. And if it comes to memories, most older people can escape into pleasant memories, and do, but what can the survivor escape to? Slaughter, and burning, and anxiety, and death. So, I think -- and I know that at the moment, studies being made about it, that there is actually a difference. Yes, the experience of aging, we all have, but in a way, the survivor has it more so. Everything gets overly intensified.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And, of course, sickness 1s another one, where people born and raised in this country, may have a relative come in, or a long time friend when they need help.

            "answer": "We were so much daily living that they almost are not conditions. I had a room. I had office hours from about 10 to about four. People came to me when they had question about their pocket money, when their laundry wasn\u2019t intact, or the cook was angry, somebody had sent the food back. So I think part of the time, I was made of all purposes, and then people had sometimes gotten letters from consulates in a different language, which I tried to translate. They had to make official phone calls, which I made for them. And almost always, they took this opportunity  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They hadn\u2019t heard from an uncle in America who was supposed to give an affidavit. The consulate hasn\u2019t let them know somebody had treated them badly. There was a rumor that Australia had -- took only people in agriculture. Whatever came up during the day, and then in the evening sometimes, we really talked about olden times, how it was at home, how they had sat around the open fire, how the grandfather had lived with them, how different it all was when the Russians came, who came riding into the kitchen, and had very different ideas of civilization. Also, on the other hand, had been very helpful. Many had been liberated by the Russians, who had liberated Auschwitz, and had really only good things to say. Other had stories that they simply had to tell, because they\u2019ve had such an injustice had to be done to him. I remember a little story which is indicative. In a camp, there were a husband and wife, and as most camps, as -- especially concentration camps, there was absolutely nothing to eat. And one day, the husband had managed to gather two potatoes to bring to his wife, who was in the barrack. And it was a very wet, damp day. He tried to balance his way on bar -- bare feet through the ward with his two potatoes, and he was very close to home when an SS man came and just threw the potatoes out of his hand, down to the floor, into the mud, so that they couldn\u2019t be eaten any more. And he said, \u201cThat was one time where I cried.\u201d And I must confess, I cried when I heard the story."

The other agencies, basically, are not giving relief. They help with everything else. And the Council of Jewish Women, I think doesn\u2019t do anything, they used to help with immigration.
