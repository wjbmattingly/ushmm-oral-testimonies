And he fell -- he was goi ng to run away and hide somewheres in the ghetto. And he fell, he broke his leg. So this was a makeshift hospital and they had some Jewish doctors who practiced -- I mean, they were doctors before the war. And he was in traction and -- his leg was in traction, was the last time I saw hi m. And he was shot in the hospital, because my cousin saw him, he was in the clean-up crew, and he saw him laying there on the sidewalk. And there were pictures of my mo ther, and of me and my brothe r around him. But I didn\u2122t know until I saw \ufb01Schindler\u2122s List,\ufb02 that they gave them poison. The nurses gave them poison. I did not know that, and I was thankful. Did you see it? They were grateful. The patients were grateful to get it, they were even smiling. Because you heard them downstairs already, yelling and screaming. And about the time they came up they st art shooting, and they didn\u2122t even notice that they were already dead. And I don\u2122t know what happened to my mother, I thought my mother might have ended up in one of the concentration camps, but she might have been shot in the ghetto, because they would just shoot left and right."

And then they concentrated us in Kabe lwerk for a short time, and then -- but -- but the time we s -- were sent back to Plasz\u00f3w, we did not work in Kabelwerk any more. This was September \u212243. And when I got there, well, we ha d to work in the concentration camp. We had to open graves, pull out gold teeth. And the people who were in charge of this place were prisoners, German prisoners. And they were completely out of control. I mean, they were murderers, they - they were in prison because they were murderer s from way before the war, and they let them out to -- to oversee us. And the guy\u2122s name Hammond, oh wow, he was crazy. He really was crazy. I saw Goeth many times and as soon as we heard he was walking through the camp, I was running away, because we knew he was target shooting, he didn\u2122t care what you looked like. He was just target shooting. He wanted to see how close he could shoot or how far he could shoot. 28 And Schindler was with him many times. And they were drinking buddies. And I really don\u2122t think Schindler -- well, he saved a lot of Jews, and like they say, who saves one life, saves the world. But I can guarantee you this man did not start out to save the Jews. He started out to -- to fill his pockets. And somehow, I think towards th e end, he found out that it\u2122s a losing war they fighting. So he changed his mind. But thank God he did, because he saved a lot of Jews. But this was terrible, I mean in the Plasz\u00f3w, whether we had to go outside and load railroad tracks again, or in -- if we worked inside, then we had to dig -- I mean, open the grav es and pull out the golden teeth, or we carried barracks. Th ey were always building barracks and we had to -- to carry that stuff. And really my legs are my weakest, my -- my health problem are my legs. You can\u2122t work like dog -- like a man and not come out scarred. So we were there until -- oh, I didn\u2122t tell you about my cousin, Janek Kalben stok. When we came back in September \u212243, people were telling me about my cousin Janek. He and a little boy were walking in the concentration camp, and evidently Goeth was walking towards him, and my little cousin Janek had a habit, he drove his mother crazy. When he was upset, he would wh istle. He didn\u2122t even know he did this. And somebody told me that he was whistling -- whistli ng that -- it was a Russian song, or -- or a French anthem, I don\u2122t know, I wasn\u2122t there. And they arrested him right there, in \u212243. And they built a gallow to hang him, all night long. And the next day they brought him out to hang him. They made his father sit in the front row, my oncl -- Uncle Henek Kalbenstok. And the rope broke. So he sent somebody for new rope and my poor little cousin must have been just scared to death and he was crawling up to Goeth\u2122s foot and kissing his boot. And they said that he was just hissing. Goeth took the gun out and shot him right th ere. My uncle saw it and he had a complete stroke. Never came back from it because when I went up there, I went to see him in Plasz\u00f3w, in that concentration camp where it all ha ppened. He was just a vegetable. 29"

We just were there 12 - 14 days, and we didn't do anything. One time we got black coffee, whatever it was, it was awful, in the morning. And we had to carry -- they were heavy kettles. And in the evening you got the water soup. So I remember that very well, it was my turn to go. And some other girls also went and coming back and we were almost our barrack and those stup id wooden shoes wouldn\u2122t stay on my feet, and I dropped the kettle and our whole supper was there. Really was scared that the people gonna kill me, the hungry people, you know, but they didn\u2122t. We just all lay down and we licked the floor, whatever fell there."

            "question": "Were you still with your aunt?",
            "answer": "Yeah. We were liberated together. Let\u2122s see, after about 12 or 14 days in Auschwitz, we were shipped back in the cattle wagon to Bergen-Belsen. And when we got to -- I think it was still January \u212244, because we were, pretty much, one of the first ones there. When we came to Bergen-Belsen they had nothing but tents. And then there was a big storm one night and it was quiet. There was no shouting and it was very quiet in comparison to Auschwitz, there was so commotion constantly. It was very quiet and my aunt said, \ufb01You know, Sylvia, in comparison to Auschwitz, this is a vacation.\ufb02 But we didn\u2122t kno w that was -- there was no gas chambers, but it was starvation camp. They just starved you to deat h. So there weren't that many people, but then 34 we had a big storm and it knocked all the tents do wn and they moved us to barracks. And they were looking for somebody who spoke a lot of la nguages, so I applied for it. I spoke German fluently. By that time already I s poke Polish fluently but couldn't read or write it, because when you\u2122re young you pick up languages. They said I spoke it with a heavy accent. So I applied for it, and I -- I knew about three words of French, or maybe five words and two words of Russian. So I got the job, not very long though, but enough that I had the foot in the kitchen. And so I could steal food so my aunt wouldn\u2122t be hungry. So th ere were Jewish people working in the kitchen and some Russian soldiers working in the kitc hen and there were three Frenchmen. They were college students and they worked with the underground Gentiles and they got caught. So they were funny, they were so funny. They all spoke German and wouldn\u2122t let the German know that they spoke German. And they would sing, and th ey would sing the French anthem. And they would laugh, and they made us laugh. But the Russian people, we had to stay away from them. When we stole food, we didn\u2122t tell on each other, but the Russians told on us when they saw us stealing food. They kept to themselves pretty mu ch. We were afraid of them. So, well, I got typhus in Bergen-Belsen and Paul LaPietra, one of the Frenchme n stole food and send it to the camp. So by the time I got the food, there wasn\u2122t that much food left because she shared it with other people, but evidently it must have helped some. And when I got bett er after two weeks, I noticed that I -- I didn\u2122t have any shoes, I don\u2122t know what happened to them, my shoes. And I told the girl, I said, \ufb01I can\u2122t go back to work in the kitchen without shoes.\ufb02 So Paul LaPietra stole some man\u2122s boots and send it to th e camp with a friend of mine. And after I went back to the kitchen, those three Frenchmen hoi sted me up on their shoulder and they were marching and they were singing la mar -- what is that? La Marsei lle, th-the French anthem. Oh, the German, I\u2122m 35 telling you, they would get so red and yell. And we say, your gonna have a stroke, he\u2122s gonna have a stroke, but no, not such luck. And we were liberated April the 14th."

And they already knew that they were in bad shape because the guards were disappearing ther e. And they came back. There was no place for them to go. We didn\u2122t know that, they were surrounded by the Russians, by the British and by the Americans, and there was no place to run around. So they were digging ditches. And oh, they were angry. I\u2122m telling you, you couldn\u2122t even set th e foot out. If not, you got shot. So we stayed pretty much indoors, and everybody was sick. No energy, no water, no food. And then I got dysentery problems again. I went out one night to relieve myself and felt something cold I was sitting on, and I looked and it was a body, and I just moved over. I mean, you got -- evidently you got conditioned to that. I mean, just thinking about it, it blows my mind, you know? And I crawled back in. So one night, it was between 14th and 15th the night, or was early in the morning, we heard the -- heard a lot of tanks, rolling and rolling and rolling. We didn\u2122t know what was the matter. And it was morning and somebody came running in, we are liberated, we are liberated. And they said, by the British army, we are liberated. Well, I crawled out there, and my aunt went out there, too. I said, \ufb01What are you talking about?\ufb02 The German commandoes, they were standing in front of the tanks. They tied them down there ev idently, I don\u2122t know. And they -- with no medals, they stripped them of all the medals, but I didn\u2122t see that. I still saw the Nazis. I said, \ufb01What you talking a bout, here they are.\ufb02 And then we found out we were liberated, and I stood up and I start singing the British anthem , God Bless the King. I remember that from school. And oh, there was such, so much commotion going on, they were so wonderful. And 36 they gave us care packages. We didn\u2122t know how to handle those care packages, we ate everything. And that\u2122s why so many died. On that starvation diet for so many years and then you drank cocoa, I mean the powder, and coffee, smok ed cigarettes, chocolate. All at one time and sardines. They meant well, I mean, they didn\u2122t me an any harm. But I think the ler -- that the world learned from that. Whatever prisoners come back, they kind of condition them slowly with food."

And I think we were on board about 11 days, because they had to stop, there were some mines and they didn't tell us they had mines in the water until they deactivated it. They didn\u2122t te ll us, we probably would have been scared to death. But I would say there were about 800 passengers, maybe with the crew also. Was a very small ship, and it was not equipped, it was not a luxury liner. We had one little room, but from the 800 people, there might have been about 40 - 50 who didn\u2122t get sick, most of them got sick, seasick. And my aunt was seasick. They -- the younger people they put in the bunkbeds, and was a great, big room, and the food was served buffe t. And that -- but my aunt, she was over 40, and she had, I think it was a semi-private room, they just gave it to he r. After -- up to a certain age. And they ate at a table, they were served, and my poor aunt was in bed all the trip. I went down every day to see her, and I want to bring her some food, and she said, \ufb01Get out of here, get out. I can\u2122t look at that food.\ufb02 So we had a good time, we entertained ourselves that -- the 45 - 50, and it was just amazing to us, when we got to New York, all in a sudden those people start pouring out the ship, you know, you haven\u2122t seen them. How did you get on? I didn\u2122t see you. But so many were sick. Then we had to wait that you had relatives, somebody had to pick you up at the pier, they wouldn\u2122t just let you go loose. And my aunt and I, we waited and waited, and my cousin in New York supposed to pick me up. I di d not know those cousins except one cousin. He was in Karlsruhe, and he was just like my brothe r. At that time first c ousins were like brothers and sisters, very close. And he\u2122s supposed to pick me up, and he just didn\u2122t show up, and my aunt and I, we were the last ones, and oh God, were we scared. I start crying, and all in a sudden a woman came up to me and she said, \ufb01You\u2122re Sy lvia Farber, aren\u2122t you? From Karlsruhe?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 And she said, \ufb01I don\u2122t know, do you remember Bernard Weismann?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yeah, I went to school with him.\ufb02 The -- the Jewish school. He had a speech defect, and the children 45 were not very kind to him, and -- children can be cruel. So she said, \ufb01Well, I really didn\u2122t have you on my list, but I looked at the list and I saw Sylvia Farber, and I wanted to greet you. So I s-switched with somebody and I want to say welcome to America, and thank you for being so nice to my son Bernard.\ufb02 A-And that kind of felt good, that people remembered you, you know, and he was such a nice boy, but the kids just didn\u2122t give him a chance. He was very intelligent. His father was a doctor, I don\u2122t know what happened to him, lost contact. So while we were talking, my cousin came with other cousins. The other cousins -- but I didn\u2122t know the other cousins, they were waiting for that one cousin, he had to sign for us. And he came, and he looked like a Farber. He looked like my dad, he looked like my brother, and we just start hugging and kissing, you know? It seemed like the Farber, the looks goes through the family. It\u2122s amazing."

So I remember Joe Wall said to me, \ufb01What are you doing on the floor?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I\u2122m not stupid. I can do better than that, just wrap packages. And well, normally a clerk couldn\u2122t have said that. But then, I didn\u2122t have the clothes I was supposed to wear, I was supposed to wear dark clothes, navy blue, or gray, or black. I didn\u2122t have it. He told me, \ufb01You wear what you got.\ufb02 So he really made -- made allowances for me.

The factories wh-where I ap-applied in Lexington wouldn\u2122t hire me because I couldn\u2122t speak English fluently. Now you could sue them because you discriminated, but at that time you didn't know about suing people. So I told him, I said, \ufb01Listen, they approached me at Martin\u2122s and they would pay me 25 dollars a week.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01We ll, if Martin\u2122s can pay you 25, I can give you 25.\ufb02 I did feel guilty because the people I worked with, s-some been working there 10 - 20 years and didn\u2122t make more than 25 or 27 dollars.

And he proposed before we got off the boat, he wanted to get married. But my aunt said, \ufb01No way. He is scared. He do esn\u2122t want to be alone to get into a country, not knowing anybody.\ufb02 So we corresponded, and we talked on the telephone sometimes.

They fixed up a date, Martha and Jake for eight o\u2122clock a certain day. It was 50 8:20 - 8:30, quarter to nine, no Jake Green. I got undressed, I put my slack suit back on, I was madder than a hornet. I wasn\u2122t used to be stood up. Doorbell rings there, \ufb01I\u2122m Jake Green.\ufb02 And I said -- he said, \ufb01If you don\u2122t want to go out with me, I will understand.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01What happened?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I got lost.\ufb02 Well, where we lived it was like Macdowell Road, and then there was a circle. And the next road Irvin, there was a circle, and he drove around in circles in the dark, and he went downtown to a gas station, and they gave him directions. And this really made sense, it\u2122s really hard, because many times we drive by now where I used to live, to see the changes in the apartment house and it\u2122s very easy to get lost. It\u2122s like a cul-de-sac, you know. It\u2122s a -- in circle. So that\u2122s how I met my husba nd. And we went out dancing, and -- I don\u2122t know, the evening passed by so fast, and I ask him now, I said, \ufb01How could you understand me? I couldn\u2122t even understand myself.\ufb02 He said was very easy. I learned a little Jewish, Yiddish, and he knew a little Yiddish, and some German, and some English. We had a marvelous time, and we both liked to dance. And we dated about a year and a half and we got married January the 16th, 1949, which is gonna be 47 years. Long time. My brother said, \ufb01It won\u2122t last.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Why?\ufb02 He had nothing against Jake, he just said, \ufb01Nobody could live with you any longer 10 days to three weeks.\ufb02 "

I didn\u2122t work outdoors, they were my whole life, my children. But I wanted to, I enjoyed it. And well, they wonderful, we love them dearly, they love us dearly, but they got their own life, and it was a good life. And altogether the only thing, I thought, well, everybody has to go through some kind of hell. And I always thought, well, I went through it early in life, and the rest of the life be -- I got smooth sailing. But I guess it wasn\u2122t enough, because then this came up with my husband\u2122s illness. But we holding together. The -- certain things I would love to do, I would love to travel. I used to travel by myself, because Jake wanted to work. And he really co uld have gone with -- but no -- with me, but in that respect, he was a small town boy, and he really didn\u2122t want to. But I went to New York, I went to visit my brother.

            "answer": "Not a whole lot. We woul d go -- after my grandson was born in Chattanooga, we would go Chattanooga about every three to four months. A nd we would drive. And he enjoyed that, Jake, he really did. But just stay over a weekend. But even before then I would go to New Jersey by myself. Now he did go with me to the Holocaust reunion in \u212283. I could have gone to Israel at that time, but he wouldn\u2122t go with me and I was afraid to go to myself. I did not know how I was going to react, because I was not in touch with survivors. And after we got to Washington in \u212283, all the survivors -- and I just t hought it was me made th e children her life, almost every survivor made the children their lives, and enjoyed taking care of them. So, it was good to -- to -- to talk to other survivors. Now some of them were very bitter and I really felt sorry for them. I mean, I feel like if you\u2122re that bitter, you wasting your life.
