            "answer": "Well, yeast obviously, you know, is made - these we were almost monopolies because there were certain ones, I mean, not many pe ople were producing yeast for making bread. Agricultural alcohol means that they woul d take beets, you know, various corn, for instance, and so on, and it would be refined as alcohol. And for a while, as a matter for fact, in Croatia, there was a law where you had to mix alcohol with gasoline, which is what they\u2122re doing here now, and this was always very protected because there were huge, huge taxes otherwise. But being as it was agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff was protected by the government because it wa s sort of beneficial to the state or whatever, or the peasantry or whatever. So, obviously there were lots of land where some of this raw material was produced, but also was bought from the peasants as needed. The yeast was, you know, shipped around and so on."

            "answer": "Yes, but my mother supervised. One of my very early memories was of a German nurse with a \u0152 who were dressed like nuns, and had this long veil. They were special children\u2122s nurses. And she was unusually unpleasant, and put me apparently into a dark room, and I do remember that, and the cook saved \u0152 me upstairs, started screaming and the woman was let go immediately, and then there was, I guess, when my brother was born, there was a peasant nanny that came and until my brother\u2122s maybe five, this was there. Then I got an English governess, Miss\u2013 her name wa s\u2013 because the second one \u0152 the first one was called Miss \ufb01Mees Smees\ufb02 \u0152 Miss Smith \u0152 she was known \ufb01Mees Smees\ufb02, who was with us for maybe six months. My brothe r was throwing tantrums and \u0152 because he couldn\u2122t stand her, and then the nanny came back for \u0152 and stayed forever as part of the household. And then there was a Swiss pers on who was quite unpleasant for about six months, and then my real English governe ss who stayed for years, whose name was Agnes Coyne. And there, there was somethi ng kind of amusing about her because when King Alexander was killed. There was a\u2013"

He had three childre n and lived in Zagreb, but then they moved back to \u0152 then they moved to Belgrade, and th ey decided they absolutely had to have our governess, and contacted her and contacted my mother, and they wanted \u0152 she didn\u2122t want to go. And my mother said, \ufb01You absolu tely have to go because we would have sanctions against us left and right. You can\u2122t say no.\ufb02 And finally she went, but apparently she was so unhappy she phoned us practically every week, and one day appeared at our doorstep with her suitcases and my mother had to make up some big story about her being sick, having to move to England, nervous breakdown and so on, and she stayed until I guess I was 16."

So, they would come and, I mean, I never traveled out of Zagreb for it, but I remember there was a very large gathering and people came from Czechosl ovakia and Bulgaria and Poland and who knows what, and there was this march and we did calisthenics and we did, you know, like the Germans did and so on. There\u2122s these horrend ous things in stadiums and in fact there was a stadium built at the time for this particul ar get together.

There was very nice \u0152 there was student, afternoon student performances with the school at a very low price, and you stood in the back if you had to, and that was permitted. I was always very pleased to do that. My grandmother had a s ubscription to various concerts which took place. And the theater of all kinds. The older \u0152 the parents, the grandmother and grandfather \u0152 went to Vienna every season to get clothes because we couldn\u2122t in Zagreb, to have them made, and to the opera especi ally. My grandmother on my father\u2122s side remarried. She was a widow. She was married, and her husband was a Croatian Jew, but he was bank director in Vienna, and she was \u0152 she loved being a Croatian, a provincial lady, and she actually brought to Vienna a Croat room, a folk room, like a peasant room. She went so far as to bring the wood paneling, cut out the way that they do in Croatia\u0152 a peasant room with peasant furniture, peasan t dolls, stuff like that, which was kind of amusing, but she lived there so then from the time I was maybe a year old or so. She died when I was five, but I remember going visiti ng there and obviously, my mother and her mother used to go every season to Vienna, once a year at least, probably twice."

In fact, if you look at a certificate, school certificate from a pub lic school in Zagreb, it was supposed to be in the two languages. So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Se rbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin script. It went that far. There was a lot of indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav. I guess you just become \u0152 many of our friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were mostly nice and decent and I don\u2122t think \u0152 they may have been anti-Semitic, but certainly not overtly so. I don\u2122t know, ma ybe some were. Some were, on the contrary, very less so. And both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very \u0152 had friends of all kinds. During King Alexander, and later on actually, even Prince Paul\u2122s regime and the various Serbian \u0152 especially after the death of Alexander, there was a lot of repression, and one of the members of my extended fa mily was a young man who was a communist. He was in the same jail as Mose Pijade, and he was killed in the war. There was a whole group of young Communist activists, leftists, all of them, of course, very idealistic, had no idea what it really meant, and who sat in jail. And my uncle, who was a lawyer, was the one who was taking packages and taking care of them, and so on. They were in very, very notorious political prisons. One of them is Lepoglava where they continued giving, you know, that was also later on in jail during the Ustashe regime and so on. So, there was a lot of that going on.

Money that was collected in taxes simply disappeared in Belgrade, and public works that were necessary in Croatia never took place. They were done in Belgrade. They weren\u2122t even done in Serbia. They were stalled along the way. And, later on, there was a political \u0152 I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which is convenio , but actually they \u0152 the Croatian Peasant party was actually now a public party, and it was not anything that was repressed in such a way, and there was a coalition government formed with Doctor Macek. And I remember during this, during the election campaign when you\u2122d drive out in the countryside, you know, the peasants would yell, \ufb01Zivio Doktor Macek! \ufb02 You also yelled, \ufb01Zivio Doktor Macek!\ufb02, and so on - May he live long."

            "answer": "Yes. One of the things that \u2122s going on is you\u2122re listening to Radio Paris. Paris Radio had a Yugoslav by the name of \u0152 I can\u2122t remember , but I do have his name written down \u0152 he was \u0152 oh, Petrovic, Sveta Petrovic. He had one of these programs, like Voice of America 28 had later on, where he was broadcasting to Yugoslavia and railing against the Germans, and then when France fell, he went on \u0152 not to Vichy \u0152 he ended up in the United States, but he followed the French government where he could \u0152 where he was broadcasting, and he ended up in the United States, and I ended up doing translations for the censors here for him, and when he was sick doing his br oadcasts for the Royal Yugoslav government, which was very funny, you were listening to that. You were listening again on the radio to neutral radio stations, and there were family councils around the table, and friends. What\u2122s going to happen now that Hitler\u2122s about to get us all? But, you didn\u2122t know where and how. This was \u0152 these were family councils going on among the members of the families \u0152 dining rooms or another. It was constant. And people who had lived in the provinces, like the parents of these cousins that were in London, moved to Zagreb to be handy to be able to leave if anybody was able to leave. The major problem was that there were currency restrictions. You couldn\u2122t send any money out. The other problem was that my father was a reserve officer, a captain fi rst class, and he would have had to have gotten permission from the army to leave. They were sending mobilizations going on. There wasn\u2122t mobilizing, but there was a \u0152 ther e was a state of alert, let\u2122s say. My father \u0152 not my father, anybody, this wasn\u2122t anyt hing exclusive \u0152 had to do every \u0152 I don\u2122t remember when you, probably, at various interv als, but at that time, I think, every two years, you had to go and do some active duty as an officer. He was a reserve officer in the Yugoslav army, and every once in a while, they would pull you for three months or six months or whatever to re- I don\u2122t know \u0152 to get them up, you know, to whatever was going to happen. To get them ready for necessary combat, and my father \u0152 this was probably in 1940 \u0152 was in Split for three months doing his military duty, and I had nothing to do. So, I came to stay with him in Split, and that was very exciting, very nice first of all, nobody was supervising me. I was liv ing in a hotel, and I would see him in the evening for dinner with the rest of the officers, which was also fun, I must say. One of the officers, there, was the Imam of the Muslim soldiers because, you know, just behind the mountain is Bosnia, and there were number of recruits who were Muslim. And I remember on one occasion how aware they we re of Hitler and anti-Semitism. The Imam saying to my father, \ufb01Don\u2122t you worry about anything, Fredo. If they come, I will say you\u2122re Muslim. The main thing has been done already.\ufb02 So, you know, this is \u0152 this is what \u0152 I think that\u2122s sort of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them."

Then, as I\u2122m walking along in Split looking at shop windows or whatever, maybe palaces, maybe Diocletian\u2122s Palace, something more cultural, my high school class turns up on their high school graduation trip, and I joined them, and that was a rather amusing thing because I have all of these dressy clothes. I was dressing in the evening in this hotel where they were staying. So, I packed all of that up, and I left it with my father who then sent it to Zagreb, and my father was on duty and a soldier was supposed to escort me to this thirdclass bus that my class was riding in to go to Dubrovnik, and I made a little suitcase of some kind or other, and this was like five o\u2122clock in the morning, five-thirty in the morning, and suddenly there\u2122s this knock on the door.

So, you had masses of quotas lying fallow in consulates, and it is very easy to get an immigration visa.

I\u2122m going to return, obviously.\ufb02 And, he said, \ufb01Okay, you\u2122ll return, but take this immigration visa.

Six hours after that they were bombed. This wa s the first time that I saw my father cry. When the whole army, everything, collapsed right away. There was no more Yugoslavia. I mean, this was such a Blitzkrieg there that th is all went to pieces and was really in bad shape. I was very happy I was going to go to wherever \u0152 India, or \u0152 I didn\u2122t want to have anything to do with that anymore. I wanted out. My mother was very sad, but I don\u2122t think she cried, but my father actually cried, and then the next thing he did, he went to Bern to talk to the representative of Yugoslavia, and nobody knew what to do. I mean, it was completely unclear what, you know, what was going to happen to Croatia. Not Croatia, I mean, what was going to happen, one way or another. It was still Yugoslavia, completely falling apart, and there was ve ry little news except the bombing Belgrade, nothing else. And, then later on, we found out , when we went on, we saw what was happening. When an independent Croatia was declared, but that was later. We went on this sealed train, came to Spain, and at first \u0152 this was very shortly after the Spanish Civil War \u0152 we stayed in a very nice hotel, but it was very obvious that this was very obvious that this was a country that had gone through a war, and it was completely obvious. Crazy thing, here we want to go to the Prado, first time we were in Spain, but the Prado is closed. So, we go sit in a caf\u00e9 to have breakfast and there\u2122s some rolls, but it\u2122s obvious that there was a war. I mean, it looked sha bby, and then children without limbs started coming to the window of this caf\u00e9 and we\u2122re sitting there having food and asking for food. This was the first time I had seen a count ry \u0152 I mean, this was a very short time 45 after the civil war in Spain, and these children \u0152 this was the saddest thing about war \u0152 without an arm or without a leg, just holdi ng their hands up, and emaciated, and so we took all the food and gave it to them and wa lked away. You couldn\u2122t sit and eat because of what was going on. We sat pretty much, and walked around a little bit through Madrid, but it was very sad, and it was very empty, and it was very obvious that they had gone through a war. Then we went to Barcelona a nd spent a couple of nights in Barcelona and we got on this horrendous bus that got us to Lisbon, and there, I think, we became very much aware of things are falling out because we didn\u2122t go to a very fancy hotel. We went to some kind of pension. It was very nice, but it wasn\u2122t a palace hotel in any place."

I think it\u2122s $500, plus a letter which asks that we take along when we get to the ship, a \u0152 well, when we get transportation, to take along a Persian carpet for the representative of Yugoslavia in Washington, D.C., who was a guy by the name of Protasce (ph) at the tim e, which I think I saw on one occasion when there still was a Yugoslavia, which we t ook along. Then, we found somebody who got in touch with us, a family of a French dipl omat. I guess it was a small place, and people heard who was where, or maybe this Yugos lav woman who I\u2122m going to talk to you about now heard that \u0152 must have gone to the Yugoslav Embassy or Yugoslav 47 Representation to talk about what\u2122s going to happen to her, and so on. She was married to a, I think, the cultural attach\u00e9 of France in Portugal, and he was supposed to go back to France, and they had a little boy. She was originally from Zagreb, and her sister\u2122s husband worked for my father in the yeast f actory, the alcohol and yeast factory. And in fact, I was wearing a jacket that her sister, who was a weaver, had woven the material for. I used that for a long time. And we took this child, and took it to his godparents who were a Yugoslav \u0152 a Croatian Jew by the name of Alexander and his Russian non-Jewish wife who were in New York already for a year."

May God save forever King Peter of Yugoslavia.\ufb02 _____ This was for about six weeks or so, I believe, I was doing it, and then finally something like the Balkan desk wa s established which was under \u0152 the chief was an Albanian, of all things, then there was some Greeks who had been \u0152 they were been shuttled back and forth, and I don\u2122t think that we actually broadcast as Voice of America in Serbo-Croatian until \u212244 probably, and so that\u2122s that."

The Uruguayan consul had left who was Jewish, and was fleeing, and this is the letter I just found of eight pages, left the official seal with his secretary and this order carried the passports to Zagreb under their robes, had them stamped, brought them back to Rome, because they had these, they were given exit visas from Italy and transit visas from Spain. Th at was my father\u2122s sister, husband, daughter and then the young man that she fell in love wi th and they finally married, and my uncle Felix somehow went to Cuba, where he sat in a sort of a holding camp because I guess they didn\u2122t feel like letting people out or couldn\u2122t get enough money out of them. He finally came to the States, and actually my fath er visited him and he had a Cuban visa at that time, in \u212244 or \u212245. I th ink it\u2122s stamped in his passport, and then finally Felix got married to an Italian Jewish woman who wa s a scientist, and then they ended up in Caracas, Venezuela."

On the other hand, others said that the Ustashe did it, but who knows? And, after the war, there were fewer and fewer, and fewer bricks because they insisted on rebuilding it unnecessarily for my taste, after the war, and the peasants needed to get their houses fixed. So, they just went and got all of the bricks. So, finally they had to build a brickyard to rebuild it, which I think was ridi culous, and now it is apparently an archive of the city of Zagreb.
