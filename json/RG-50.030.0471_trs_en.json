I don\u2019t think that he was a particularly inventive or artistic or whatever, but he was a work-a-day architect who always kept his profession, whereas the rest of his family was spending money like crazy and ended up paupers, many of them, after spending money like mad in one direction or another.

Croatia obviously was a very agricult \u2014 mostly, 80 percent agricultural country, and he had alcohol \u2014 and he had an alcohol yeast factory which was a very large one, and probably the largest in that part of Croatia, and a number of other agricultural refineries and so on."

            "question": "Since I\u2019m ignorant, what does it mean to have an alcohol yeast factory? What is that?",
            "answer": "Well, yeast obviously, you know, is made - these we were almost monopolies because there were certain ones, I mean, not many people were producing yeast for making bread. Agricultural alcohol means that they would take beets, you know, various corn, for instance, and so on, and it would be refined as alcohol. And for a while, as a matter for fact, in Croatia, there was a law where you had to mix alcohol with gasoline, which is what they\u2019re doing here now, and this was always very protected because there were huge, huge taxes otherwise. But being as it was agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff was protected by the government because it was sort of beneficial to the state or whatever, or the peasantry or whatever. So, obviously there were lots of land where some of this raw material was produced, but also was bought from the peasants as needed. The yeast was, you know, shipped around and so on."

            "question": "Now, were you taken care of primarily by governesses at this time?",
            "answer": "Yes, but my mother supervised. One of my very early memories was of a German nurse with a \u2014 who were dressed like nuns, and had this long veil. They were special children\u2019s nurses. And she was unusually unpleasant, and put me apparently into a dark room, and I do remember that, and the cook saved \u2014 me upstairs, started screaming and the woman was let go immediately, and then there was, I guess, when my brother was born, there was a peasant nanny that came and until my brother\u2019s maybe five, this was there. Then I got an English governess, Miss... her name was... because the second one \u2014 the first one was called Miss \u201cMees Smees\u201d \u2014 Miss Smith \u2014 she was known \u201cMees Smees\u201d\u2019,, who was with us for maybe six months. My brother was throwing tantrums and \u2014 because he couldn\u2019t stand her, and then the nanny came back for \u2014 and stayed forever as part of the household. And then there was a Swiss person who was quite unpleasant for about six months, and then my real English governess who stayed for years, whose name was Agnes Coyne. And there, there was something kind of amusing about her because when King Alexander was killed. There was a..."

There was a regency formed because Peter was too young to govern and one of the \u2014 I mean, the main member of this, of this regency was King Alexander\u2019s cousin, Prince Paul, and two other persons \u2014 one was a Slovene and the other was a guy buy name of Ivo Perovic, which was a Croatian ban, which was sort of like a governor of a state. He had three children and lived in Zagreb, but then they moved back to \u2014 then they moved to Belgrade, and they decided they absolutely had to have our governess, and contacted her and contacted my mother, and they wanted \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to go. And my mother said, \u201cYou absolutely have to go because we would have sanctions against us left and right. You can\u2019t say no.\u201d And finally she went, but apparently she was so unhappy she phoned us practically every week, and one day appeared at our doorstep with her suitcases and my mother had to make up some big story about her being sick, having to move to England, nervous breakdown and so on, and she stayed until I guess I was 16."

The Sokol is a pan-Slavistic \u2014 pan-Slavic gym organization and also, I guess, pan-national, pan-Slavistic nationalistic organization, that had a lot of calisthenic-type things, and I went to that which took place \u2014 I can\u2019t remember \u2014 in some \u2014 there was a thing, yes, they had a particular hall in town which was called a Sokolan (ph), and there were dances there as a matter of fact and so on. And, somewhere in the early 30s, maybe \u201932 and so on, they had \u2014 there were things like the Olympics but only Slavic. So, they would come and, I mean, I never traveled out of Zagreb for it, but I remember there was a very large gathering and people came from Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria and Poland and who knows what, and there was this march and we did calisthenics and we did, you know, like the Germans did and so on. There\u2019s these horrendous things in stadiums and in fact there was a stadium built at the time for this particular get together. And then later when I was about 12, again, my brother and others in the family were in the Maccabi, I was a member of the HASK, which was the Crotian academic sports club, Hrvatski akademski sportski klub, which still exists. It was a big soccer club and gym, and I did \u2014 what was it? \u2014 track, I ran marathons and that kind of thing. It was short marathons, and trained with it, and stuff like that."

This was not all the time, but there was maybe a period of three, four years where this was really seriously required. And we had religious classes both in public high school and obviously in the Jewish school where I went \u2014 I went to four years to the elementary school, to the Jewish school, where we learned both biblical Hebrew and then later on modern Hebrew, and sang various things and so on.

In fact, if you look at a certificate, school certificate from a public school in Zagreb, 1t was supposed to be in the two languages. So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Serbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin script. It went that far. There was a lot of indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav. I guess you just become \u2014 many of our friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were mostly nice and decent and I don\u2019t think \u2014 they may have been anti-Semitic, but certainly not overtly so. I don\u2019t know, maybe some were. Some were, on the contrary, very less so. And both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very \u2014 had friends of all kinds. During King Alexander, and later on actually, even Prince Paul\u2019s regime and the various Serbian \u2014 especially after the death of Alexander, there was a lot of repression, and one of the members of my extended family was a young man who was a communist. He was in the same jail as Mose Piyade, and he was killed in the war. There was a whole group of young Communist activists, leftists, all of them, of course, very idealistic, had no idea what it really meant, and who sat in jail. And my uncle, who was a lawyer, was the one who was taking packages and taking care of them, and so on. They were in very, very notorious political prisons. One of them is Lepoglava where they continued giving, you know, that was also later on in jail during the Ustashe regime and so on. So, there was a lot of that going on.

At that time, Doctor Macek, who was sort of the leader of the Croatian peasant party and then later on became a member of the government, was in the opposition, and you lived in Croatia and not in Belgrade. You have \u2014 a lot of taxes and \u2014 not a lot, most, almost everything went to Belgrade. So, there it was [coughs], excuse me, there was a great deal of corruption of one kind or another. Money that was collected in taxes simply disappeared in Belgrade, and public works that were necessary in Croatia never took place. They were done in Belgrade. They weren\u2019t even done in Serbia. They were stalled along the way. And, later on, there was a political \u2014I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which 1s convenio, but actually they \u2014 the Croatian Peasant party was actually now a public party, and it was not anything that was repressed in such a way, and there was a coalition government formed with Doctor Macek. And I remember during this, during the election campaign when you\u2019d drive out in the countryside, you know, the peasants would yell, \u201cZivio Doktor Macek!\u201d You also yelled, \u201cZivio Doktor Macek!\u2019, and so on - May he live long."

They were Alfred and Erich Miller, their name was. And they were there, their parents were there, and two uncles of ours were there, and I guess they came to leave me in school.

That was really traumatic because \u2014 yeah, I remember that very well. I did odds and ends. I took classes in History of Art. There was some sort of free university which was for people who did not \u2014 who were not inscribed, that you could go to classes. The British Council was running English classes and I sat in on them for laughs, really, because a friend of mine had gone there and did a course in proficiency in English which oddly, somewhere in \u201947, I got the results of the exams. Could you believe it? Somebody found them at the British Council after the war through a relative of mine. I learned typing, so I would know something worthwhile and practical for the future.

            "answer": "Yes. One of the things that\u2019s going on is you\u2019re listening to Radio Paris. Paris Radio had a Yugoslav by the name of \u2014 I can\u2019t remember, but I do have his name written down \u2014 he was \u2014 oh, Petrovic, Sveta Petrovic. He had one of these programs, like Voice of America had later on, where he was broadcasting to Yugoslavia and railing against the Germans, and then when France fell, he went on \u2014 not to Vichy \u2014 he ended up in the United States, but he followed the French government where he could \u2014 where he was broadcasting, and he ended up in the United States, and I ended up doing translations for the censors here for him, and when he was sick doing his broadcasts for the Royal Yugoslav government, which was very funny, you were listening to that. You were listening again on the radio to neutral radio stations, and there were family councils around the table, and friends. What\u2019s going to happen now that Hitler\u2019s about to get us all? But, you didn\u2019t know where and how. This was \u2014 these were family councils going on among the members of the families \u2014 dining rooms or another. It was constant. And people who had lived in the provinces, like the parents of these cousins that were in London, moved to Zagreb to be handy to be able to leave if anybody was able to leave. The major problem was that there were currency restrictions. You couldn\u2019t send any money out. The other problem was that my father was a reserve officer, a captain first class, and he would have had to have gotten permission from the army to leave. They were sending mobilizations going on. There wasn\u2019t mobilizing, but there was a \u2014 there was a state of alert, let\u2019s say. My father \u2014not my father, anybody, this wasn\u2019t anything exclusive \u2014 had to do every \u2014 I don\u2019t remember when you, probably, at various intervals, but at that time, I think, every two years, you had to go and do some active duty as an officer. He was a reserve officer in the Yugoslav army, and every once in a while, they would pull you for three months or six months or whatever to re- I don\u2019t know \u2014 to get them up, you know, to whatever was going to happen. To get them ready for necessary combat, and my father \u2014 this was probably in 1940 \u2014 was in Split for three months doing his military duty, and I had nothing to do. So, I came to stay with him in Split, and that was very exciting, very nice first of all, nobody was supervising me. I was living in a hotel, and I would see him in the evening for dinner with the rest of the officers, which was also fun, I must say. One of the officers, there, was the Imam of the Muslim soldiers because, you know, just behind the mountain is Bosnia, and there were number of recruits who were Muslim. And I remember on one occasion how aware they were of Hitler and anti-Semitism. The Imam saying to my father, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about anything, Fredo. If they come, I will say you\u2019re Muslim. The main thing has been done already.\u201d So, you know, this 1s \u2014 this is what \u2014 I think that\u2019s sort of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them."

Then, as I\u2019m walking along in Split looking at shop windows or whatever, maybe palaces, maybe Diocletian\u2019s Palace, something more cultural, my high school class turns up on their high school graduation trip, and I joined them, and that was a rather amusing thing because I have all of these dressy clothes. I was dressing 1n the evening in this hotel where they were staying. So, I packed all of that up, and I left 1t with my father who then sent it to Zagreb, and my father was on duty and a soldier was supposed to escort me to this third- class bus that my class was riding in to go to Dubrovnik, and I made a little suitcase of some kind or other, and this was like five o\u2019clock in the morning, five-thirty in the morning, and suddenly there\u2019s this knock on the door.

My father gave him the suit of armor, which was cluttering things up, and I don\u2019t know how authentic or \u2014 it was a suit of armor that probably was authentic, and he was very happy to give us a visa. Now, one reason why this was going on was there were \u2014 as nobody could leave Yugoslavia \u2014 quotas \u2014 you know, the visas were given by country quotas at the time \u2014 were not being used in Yugoslavia. So, you had masses of quotas lying fallow in consulates, and it is very easy to get an immigration visa. And when my father asked for the visa, and the man in the Counsel said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take an immigration visa?\u201d And, my father said, \u201cWhat would I need an immigration visa for? I\u2019m going to return, obviously.\u201d And, he said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019 ll return, but take this immigration visa.

The night that we arrive and called Belgrade at midnight of April 5\" or 6\" and speak to the family, and they say everything is quiet, we shouldn\u2019t be crazy. Six hours after that they were bombed. This was the first time that I saw my father cry. When the whole army, everything, collapsed right away. There was no more Yugoslavia. I mean, this was such a Blitzkrieg there that this all went to pieces and was really in bad shape. I was very happy I was going to go to wherever \u2014 India, or \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with that anymore. I wanted out. My mother was very sad, but I don\u2019t think she cried, but my father actually cried, and then the next thing he did, he went to Bern to talk to the representative of Yugoslavia, and nobody knew what to do. I mean, it was completely unclear what, you know, what was going to happen to Croatia. Not Croatia, I mean, what was going to happen, one way or another. It was still Yugoslavia, completely falling apart, and there was very little news except the bombing Belgrade, nothing else. And, then later on, we found out, when we went on, we saw what was happening. When an independent Croatia was declared, but that was later. We went on this sealed train, came to Spain, and at first \u2014 this was very shortly after the Spanish Civil War \u2014 we stayed in a very nice hotel, but it was very obvious that this was very obvious that this was a country that had gone through a war, and it was completely obvious. Crazy thing, here we want to go to the Prado, first time we were in Spain, but the Prado is closed. So, we go sit in a caf\u00e9 to have breakfast and there\u2019s some rolls, but it\u2019s obvious that there was a war. I mean, it looked shabby, and then children without limbs started coming to the window of this caf\u00e9 and we\u2019re sitting there having food and asking for food. This was the first time I had seen a country \u2014 I mean, this was a very short time after the civil war in Spain, and these children \u2014 this was the saddest thing about war \u2014 without an arm or without a leg, just holding their hands up, and emaciated, and so we took all the food and gave it to them and walked away. You couldn\u2019t sit and eat because of what was going on. We sat pretty much, and walked around a little bit through Madrid, but it was very sad, and it was very empty, and it was very obvious that they had gone through a war. Then we went to Barcelona and spent a couple of nights in Barcelona and we got on this horrendous bus that got us to Lisbon, and there, I think, we became very much aware of things are falling out because we didn\u2019t go to a very fancy hotel. We went to some kind of pension. It was very nice, but it wasn\u2019t a palace hotel in any place."

I guess it was a small place, and people heard who was where, or maybe this Yugoslav woman who I\u2019m going to talk to you about now heard that \u2014 must have gone to the Yugoslav Embassy or Yugoslav Representation to talk about what\u2019s going to happen to her, and so on. She was married to a, I think, the cultural attach\u00e9 of France in Portugal, and he was supposed to go back to France, and they had a little boy. She was originally from Zagreb, and her sister\u2019s husband worked for my father in the yeast factory, the alcohol and yeast factory. And in fact, I was wearing a jacket that her sister, who was a weaver, had woven the material for. I used that for a long time. And we took this child, and took it to his godparents who were a Yugoslav \u2014 a Croatian Jew by the name of Alexander and his Russian non-Jewish wife who were in New York already for a year."

I was doing translations and nothing much. Then, this guy that I told you that was doing the broadcasting from Paris originally, was doing broadcasting in \u2014 it wasn\u2019t even Voice of America, I think it was still part of Coordinated Information, if I\u2019m not mistaken, 1s what it was called. But they had broadcasting facilities. So, from the same place where Voice of America was, he was broadcasting there, and I was translating it into English for the censors. Then, the man got sick, and I was the one who was broadcasting, and I had to end the \u2014 I said who I was because they knew who he was and so on, and I said I was broadcasting in his name, and it ended up, \u201cMay God save King Peter forever. May God save forever King Peter of Yugoslavia.\u201d This was for about six weeks or so, I believe, I was doing it, and then finally something like the Balkan desk was established which was under \u2014 the chief was an Albanian, of all things, then there was some Greeks who had been \u2014 they were been shuttled back and forth, and I don\u2019t think that we actually broadcast as Voice of America in Serbo-Croatian until \u201944 probably, and so that\u2019s that."

I don\u2019t know, maybe because I was older. I have no idea. Maybe, because he was better looking than me. He was very good looking person, and I was, for a while there, a very thin child with glasses who was sloppy, and that kind of thing. He was a good looking young man. So, I think \u2014 for a child, and they fed him well, and he got round, and I was always scrawny at that time. So, you know. I think that may have been part of it.

They help Jews. They helped Ustashe. They helped Germans. They helped everyone. That was their job, and these people took their passports to Zagreb. The Uruguayan consul had left who was Jewish, and was fleeing, and this is the letter I just found of eight pages, left the official seal with his secretary and this order carried the passports to Zagreb under their robes, had them stamped, brought them back to Rome, because they had these, they were given exit visas from Italy and transit visas from Spain. That was my father\u2019s sister, husband, daughter and then the young man that she fell in love with and they finally married, and my uncle Felix somehow went to Cuba, where he sat in a sort of a holding camp because I guess they didn\u2019t feel like letting people out or couldn\u2019t get enough money out of them.

According to one story \u2014 we know that the Germans kept ammunition in the cellar, and we\u2019re told that they exploded this when they were retreating. On the other hand, others said that the Ustashe did it, but who knows? And, after the war, there were fewer and fewer, and fewer bricks because they insisted on rebuilding it unnecessarily for my taste, after the war, and the peasants needed to get their houses fixed. So, they just went and got all of the bricks. So, finally they had to build a brickyard to rebuild it, which I think was ridiculous, and now it is apparently an archive of the city of Zagreb. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside. Dora was there. She was the last one there, and it\u2019s all painted up."
