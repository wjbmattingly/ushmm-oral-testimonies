I don\u2019t think that he was a particularly inventive or artistic or whatever, but he was a work-a-day architect who always kept his profession, whereas the rest of his family was spending money like crazy and ended up paupers, many of them, after spending money like mad in one direction or another.

Croatia obviously was a very agricult \u2014 mostly, 80 percent agricultural country, and he had alcohol \u2014 and he had an alcohol yeast factory which was a very large one, and probably the largest in that part of Croatia, and a number of other agricultural refineries and so on."

            "answer": "Well, yeast obviously, you know, is made - these we were almost monopolies because there were certain ones, I mean, not many people were producing yeast for making bread. Agricultural alcohol means that they would take beets, you know, various corn, for instance, and so on, and it would be refined as alcohol. And for a while, as a matter for fact, in Croatia, there was a law where you had to mix alcohol with gasoline, which is what they\u2019re doing here now, and this was always very protected because there were huge, huge taxes otherwise. But being as it was agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff was protected by the government because it was sort of beneficial to the state or whatever, or the peasantry or whatever. So, obviously there were lots of land where some of this raw material was produced, but also was bought from the peasants as needed. The yeast was, you know, shipped around and so on."

            "question": "Now, were you taken care of primarily by governesses at this time?",
            "answer": "Yes, but my mother supervised. One of my very early memories was of a German nurse with a \u2014 who were dressed like nuns, and had this long veil. They were special children\u2019s nurses. And she was unusually unpleasant, and put me apparently into a dark room, and I do remember that, and the cook saved \u2014 me upstairs, started screaming and the woman was let go immediately, and then there was, I guess, when my brother was born, there was a peasant nanny that came and until my brother\u2019s maybe five, this was there. Then I got an English governess, Miss... her name was... because the second one \u2014 the first one was called Miss \u201cMees Smees\u201d \u2014 Miss Smith \u2014 she was known \u201cMees Smees\u201d\u2019,, who was with us for maybe six months. My brother was throwing tantrums and \u2014 because he couldn\u2019t stand her, and then the nanny came back for \u2014 and stayed forever as part of the household. And then there was a Swiss person who was quite unpleasant for about six months, and then my real English governess who stayed for years, whose name was Agnes Coyne. And there, there was something kind of amusing about her because when King Alexander was killed. There was a..."

There was a regency formed because Peter was too young to govern and one of the \u2014 I mean, the main member of this, of this regency was King Alexander\u2019s cousin, Prince Paul, and two other persons \u2014 one was a Slovene and the other was a guy buy name of Ivo Perovic, which was a Croatian ban, which was sort of like a governor of a state. He had three children and lived in Zagreb, but then they moved back to \u2014 then they moved to Belgrade, and they decided they absolutely had to have our governess, and contacted her and contacted my mother, and they wanted \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to go. And my mother said, \u201cYou absolutely have to go because we would have sanctions against us left and right. You can\u2019t say no.\u201d And finally she went, but apparently she was so unhappy she phoned us practically every week, and one day appeared at our doorstep with her suitcases and my mother had to make up some big story about her being sick, having to move to England, nervous breakdown and so on, and she stayed until I guess I was 16."

There\u2019s these horrendous things in stadiums and in fact there was a stadium built at the time for this particular get together.

In fact, if you look at a certificate, school certificate from a public school in Zagreb, 1t was supposed to be in the two languages. So, you have it in Cyrillic, in Serbian, and you have it in Serbian with Latin script. It went that far. There was a lot of indoctrination, very intensely Yugoslav. I guess you just become \u2014 many of our friends were Croatian, peasant party people, who were mostly nice and decent and I don\u2019t think \u2014 they may have been anti-Semitic, but certainly not overtly so. I don\u2019t know, maybe some were. Some were, on the contrary, very less so. And both my father and my uncle who was a lawyer were very, very \u2014 had friends of all kinds. During King Alexander, and later on actually, even Prince Paul\u2019s regime and the various Serbian \u2014 especially after the death of Alexander, there was a lot of repression, and one of the members of my extended family was a young man who was a communist. He was in the same jail as Mose Piyade, and he was killed in the war. There was a whole group of young Communist activists, leftists, all of them, of course, very idealistic, had no idea what it really meant, and who sat in jail. And my uncle, who was a lawyer, was the one who was taking packages and taking care of them, and so on. They were in very, very notorious political prisons. One of them is Lepoglava where they continued giving, you know, that was also later on in jail during the Ustashe regime and so on. So, there was a lot of that going on.

At that time, Doctor Macek, who was sort of the leader of the Croatian peasant party and then later on became a member of the government, was in the opposition, and you lived in Croatia and not in Belgrade. You have \u2014 a lot of taxes and \u2014 not a lot, most, almost everything went to Belgrade. So, there it was [coughs], excuse me, there was a great deal of corruption of one kind or another. Money that was collected in taxes simply disappeared in Belgrade, and public works that were necessary in Croatia never took place. They were done in Belgrade. They weren\u2019t even done in Serbia. They were stalled along the way. And, later on, there was a political \u2014I keep wanting to say the Spanish word which 1s convenio, but actually they \u2014 the Croatian Peasant party was actually now a public party, and it was not anything that was repressed in such a way, and there was a coalition government formed with Doctor Macek. And I remember during this, during the election campaign when you\u2019d drive out in the countryside, you know, the peasants would yell, \u201cZivio Doktor Macek!\u201d You also yelled, \u201cZivio Doktor Macek!\u2019, and so on - May he live long."

You were listening again on the radio to neutral radio stations, and there were family councils around the table, and friends. What\u2019s going to happen now that Hitler\u2019s about to get us all? But, you didn\u2019t know where and how. This was \u2014 these were family councils going on among the members of the families \u2014 dining rooms or another. It was constant. And people who had lived in the provinces, like the parents of these cousins that were in London, moved to Zagreb to be handy to be able to leave if anybody was able to leave. The major problem was that there were currency restrictions. You couldn\u2019t send any money out. The other problem was that my father was a reserve officer, a captain first class, and he would have had to have gotten permission from the army to leave. They were sending mobilizations going on. There wasn\u2019t mobilizing, but there was a \u2014 there was a state of alert, let\u2019s say.

So, I came to stay with him in Split, and that was very exciting, very nice first of all, nobody was supervising me. I was living in a hotel, and I would see him in the evening for dinner with the rest of the officers, which was also fun, I must say. One of the officers, there, was the Imam of the Muslim soldiers because, you know, just behind the mountain is Bosnia, and there were number of recruits who were Muslim. And I remember on one occasion how aware they were of Hitler and anti-Semitism. The Imam saying to my father, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about anything, Fredo. If they come, I will say you\u2019re Muslim. The main thing has been done already.\u201d So, you know, this 1s \u2014 this is what \u2014 I think that\u2019s sort of indicative of what the camaraderie was all among them."

My father gave him the suit of armor, which was cluttering things up, and I don\u2019t know how authentic or \u2014 it was a suit of armor that probably was authentic, and he was very happy to give us a visa. Now, one reason why this was going on was there were \u2014 as nobody could leave Yugoslavia \u2014 quotas \u2014 you know, the visas were given by country quotas at the time \u2014 were not being used in Yugoslavia. So, you had masses of quotas lying fallow in consulates, and it is very easy to get an immigration visa. And when my father asked for the visa, and the man in the Counsel said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take an immigration visa?\u201d And, my father said, \u201cWhat would I need an immigration visa for? I\u2019m going to return, obviously.\u201d And, he said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019 ll return, but take this immigration visa.

So, when we came to Belgrade, first of all, we had the permission from the army, then they wrote in this delegation thing that he was going as a delegate of the Ministry. Otherwise would have not been able to get there. And we all got these official visas, because you didn\u2019t just get a visa. You got an official visa. I know that my uncle \u2014 my uncle, I think had an affair with the prime minister\u2019s \u2014 the prime minister\u2019s wife. He was all over the place. He was a very, a popular guy, and had generally all sorts of connections. He was divorced first. He was a likeable, nice guy who had connections, and I think he helped somehow hasten things. We spent one horrendous night. There were two other members of the family, one or two \u2014 my aunt\u2019s husband was also a lawyer who was a businessman, who was there in Belgrade and I don\u2019t know why, and somebody else. And at the very last minute, we found that there was an industrial or some kind of fair, either industrial fair or an agricultural fair or something like that in Budapest, and they were giving visas.

The Germans were in Greece already, couldn\u2019t go through Bulgaria, couldn\u2019t go through Italy, couldn\u2019t go through Austria via Slovenia. This was the only way to go, and this was some kind of probably excursion visa, I\u2019m not quite sure, but they were giving these visas because there was this fair. We spent the night in Belgrade, and the next morning \u2014 naturally Yugoslavia was completed mobilized by that time \u2014 and decided that the chauffer would help us with the cars and go with us to the Hungarian border, and then be able to report back to the family whether we crossed or not. And in the train, my father wrote out an affidavit or something and said to the chauffer, who clearly was a member of the family, \u201cYou will need to take care of your family. Use this car as a taxi or whatever you want.\u201d And he gave him all the papers, and the piece of paper and the letter in which he said that he should take this car, which he did.

The car was requisitioned and he became his driver, and stayed with him until the very last, and didn\u2019t tell him that he was fleeing, and this poor guy was caught by the British, and Artukovic took off to Argentina and finally ended up here."

Six hours after that they were bombed. This was the first time that I saw my father cry. When the whole army, everything, collapsed right away. There was no more Yugoslavia. I mean, this was such a Blitzkrieg there that this all went to pieces and was really in bad shape. I was very happy I was going to go to wherever \u2014 India, or \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with that anymore. I wanted out. My mother was very sad, but I don\u2019t think she cried, but my father actually cried, and then the next thing he did, he went to Bern to talk to the representative of Yugoslavia, and nobody knew what to do. I mean, it was completely unclear what, you know, what was going to happen to Croatia. Not Croatia, I mean, what was going to happen, one way or another. It was still Yugoslavia, completely falling apart, and there was very little news except the bombing Belgrade, nothing else. And, then later on, we found out, when we went on, we saw what was happening. When an independent Croatia was declared, but that was later. We went on this sealed train, came to Spain, and at first \u2014 this was very shortly after the Spanish Civil War \u2014 we stayed in a very nice hotel, but it was very obvious that this was very obvious that this was a country that had gone through a war, and it was completely obvious.

So, we go sit in a caf\u00e9 to have breakfast and there\u2019s some rolls, but it\u2019s obvious that there was a war.

You couldn\u2019t sit and eat because of what was going on. We sat pretty much, and walked around a little bit through Madrid, but it was very sad, and it was very empty, and it was very obvious that they had gone through a war. Then we went to Barcelona and spent a couple of nights in Barcelona and we got on this horrendous bus that got us to Lisbon, and there, I think, we became very much aware of things are falling out because we didn\u2019t go to a very fancy hotel. We went to some kind of pension. It was very nice, but it wasn\u2019t a palace hotel in any place."

Nothing was else was going on in the rest of the country, I mean, the rest of Europe except for Portugal was at war.

I don\u2019t know, maybe because I was older. I have no idea. Maybe, because he was better looking than me. He was very good looking person, and I was, for a while there, a very thin child with glasses who was sloppy, and that kind of thing. He was a good looking young man. So, I think \u2014 for a child, and they fed him well, and he got round, and I was always scrawny at that time. So, you know. I think that may have been part of it.

They help Jews. They helped Ustashe. They helped Germans. They helped everyone. That was their job, and these people took their passports to Zagreb. The Uruguayan consul had left who was Jewish, and was fleeing, and this is the letter I just found of eight pages, left the official seal with his secretary and this order carried the passports to Zagreb under their robes, had them stamped, brought them back to Rome, because they had these, they were given exit visas from Italy and transit visas from Spain. That was my father\u2019s sister, husband, daughter and then the young man that she fell in love with and they finally married, and my uncle Felix somehow went to Cuba, where he sat in a sort of a holding camp because I guess they didn\u2019t feel like letting people out or couldn\u2019t get enough money out of them. He finally came to the States, and actually my father visited him and he had a Cuban visa at that time, in \u201944 or \u201945.
