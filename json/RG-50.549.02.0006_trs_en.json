They\u2019re maybe were two or three of them left altogether in the class, and -- but as far as non-Jewish girls, other than being in the school with them no, I don\u2019t think I was really friendly with any of them. That were strange over there, see, because we grew up separated, you know, from early childhood, and we never mixed with non-Jewish people. We only wil -- saw Jewish kids.

Hitler was already on the horizons and as sweet as the nuns were -- there were a couple of them who were wonderful, and I really think of them highly forever, because they were nice human beings.

And in those days a lot of Jewish people did convert to Catholicism and -- hoping it will save them, but nothing did. Nothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in Hungary centuries back -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back, so it didn\u2019t help. I remember when we were in the wagon already, there was a young woman doctor with us, she never knew she was Jewish. Her parents converted during the first World War or right after, so she was born, you know, as Christian. And yet she was considered a Jew."

Well, the thing I mentioned then, I believe it was that when we were being marched from the ghetto to the brick factory, there was one of the girls that I went to school with and I used to walk with her home from school, and she thought of nothing picking up a stone and throw it at me.

You -- you rushed through it a little bit in your previous interview. I mean, how did you find out that it was going to happen and what -- could you tell us, sort of take us through from when you found out that it was going to happen til when you were actually --",
            "answer": "[indecipherable] okay, let me go back to the Jewish school, 1938, when our principal came into the class -- well, I guess he went to every class, to tell us what\u2019s happening in the world and what we may accep -- expect. And he had -- a big guy, and he had tears in his eye -- his eyes as he was talking to us. That was 1938, and I think s -- well, at first -- after that 1t was getting harder to hold a job if you were a Jew. I remember in 1939 it was when my father lost his job, he was a -- a district manager for a -- a farm machinery company, and he lost his job because he was a Jew. And then 1942 -- well, in 1939, when Hitler gave back the northern part of Hungary that belonged to Czechoslovakia, and that time to Hungary. And my father was in a uniform, the Hungarian army\u2019s uniform. He fought in the first World War, so he was called up again to pay the country back. And by 1941 he was called into labor camp, \u201941 - \u201942 then they let him out for awhile and then they- took him back again. In 1944, March 19\", it was on a Sunday afternoon when the Germans -- German army flew over Hungary. I can still see it, it was a dreary, nasty day. No sunshine at all, and I guess it was foreboding of what was coming. And we saw the plane fly over our city and after that it went one, two, three. They came in on the 19\". By April fifth we had to put on the Jewish star. May sixth we were put into the ghetto. I was watching them building the six foot high wall all around the area. In my town, in Debrecen, they had to make two different ghettos because there was a main road going to the railroad station which they couldn\u2019t cut off. So there was a smaller side where we lived and there was a larger side on the other side. So our house happened to be in the smaller area, so that\u2019s where we were. And to the day the wall was finished we did not believe it, that it will happen. It was impossible, we lived there forever. I was born there, I grew up there. People were hoping that the mayor of the city, little did they know that he had no say so, won\u2019t let it happen. But at any rate, May 6, 1944, we were locked into the ghetto. And in June --"

And then we knew. I mean ho-how long can you stay stupid, right? I mean, you had to know something was happening. My father wasn\u2019t home and there we were, my mother and the four of us and a -- a little cousin of mine, my mother\u2019s nephew, her sister\u2019s son who came with us to live. And that\u2019s it. We started to pack whatever we could and by noon people were coming into the house to make sure that we\u2019re not taking anything valuable with us. So much so that there were two guys and one woman who came to the house, and the woman took my mother into the bedroom to check her inside, literally, her inside, to make sure that she is not hiding anything 1n her body that\u2019s valuable. And the afternoon we were over at the other side. And that was that. That was Sunday afternoon and then, for a strange reason, luckily, they brought my father back with a bunch of other people in his group. So at that point in time we were all together. My family and a -- a brother of my mother -- father and her -- his sister. And another cousin of mine."

We had to get into groups every day and walk down to the railroad tracks and wait in case we were going to be taken someplace. We didn\u2019t know where, but we were going to be taken someplace. And then they started to group people together, and we ended up in a group, they had many children in the families. And I think I was the fifth or sixth there and finally they put us into the wagons and we started off. We went to the border of Hungary and Slovakia and I remember there was one of the Hungarian gendars who was on the -- standing on the back of the train. I guess, now in looking back I think the wagons, the car we were in, the cattle car we were in must have been the last one. Either that or each one of them had one of those guys standing there, traveling with us. And that guy, I remember when it -- they start the train and he said to us, that\u2019s as far as I can go with you. God be with you. So he must have been somebody with a little heart, or maybe he knew where we were supposed to be going. And that was that and I remember at that point I had the feeling that this is it, you know, all of a sudden it just hit that I\u2019ll probably never get out of the cattle car alive. And some miracle happened, for some reason we Stayed there overnight and the train didn\u2019t move and th -- early in the morning it started to roll again and we were looking through the cracks which way we\u2019re going and we were going back into Hungary, we were in the middle of Hungary. Next we knew we start to now s -- go to Budapest. And soon after that we kept going and we crossed the border to Austria and -- and there we were. We ended up in Austria."

But what he found out was that there was a group of people who made a deal with the Germans to be taken out of Hungary from Budapest, or wherever, from all over the country. And somebody made a mistake who was directing the -- the cattle cars, and by the time they realized that they took those people on the way to Auschwitz and called Eichmann, the -- the trainload was too far gone to bring them back.

And my aunt was left with a small child who was about four years old at the time and a daughter who was a young teenager. And she decided to liquidate whatever she had over there and then to come to live with us, because they were very close [indecipherable] my mother. And she wanted to be with us til the war was over. And my parents went in September between the high holidays, between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur to bring the child over to our home, so she should be free to take care of her business and then would follow. Well, it took her longer than she thought it would, and then around Christmas, December, they came over and -- Christmastime they came over and wanted to take the boy home and he wouldn\u2019t go, he wanted to stay with us. And then in the spring my parents wanted to send the child back to her, and my father almost found somebody who was going there with her -- with his daughter and at first they agreed that okay, they\u2019re going to take a chance and take the child back. In the last minute they said no, we're afraid to take a child because if they find out you\u2019re taking a Jewish child, we get in trouble too, so they didn\u2019t take him. And as it happened, he survived, today he is a doctor and he lives in Texas, and his mother and sister is gone and we don\u2019t know how and -- but they died in Auschwitz, both of them.
