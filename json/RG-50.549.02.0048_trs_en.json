            "question": "You\u2019re still trying to -- You\u2019re still questioning on that level, is that what you\u2019re saying?",
            "answer": "No, I don\u2019t question any more, | think that I have my answers. I think I have my answers. I feel that the German nation was misled, and that there is not only -- there are two entities who are guilty of mass murder. We know of the executioners, it was Hitler\u2019s political cronies, who went along with him, to eliminate the Jewish people wherever he could get them. But anti-Semitism was -- or racism, whatever you want to call it, goes back centuries, many centuries, and the original sin was committed by Christians, by the church, which actually propagated, I would say the -- the persecutions of Jews, by accusing the Jewish people of whatever was convenient for them. For instance, up to today, the idea that the Jews killed Christ, prevails within a large segment of people who do not know history. It is known, for instance, that the crucifixion was an act of erga -- Romans. It was their law by which they -- by which they sentenced people to death. The Jews stoned. And I want to tell you a very interesting story. I met, a year ago, a lady of the name Anna Rubenstein, who wrote a couple books, I believe three books. She a foo -- survivor of Auschwitz, and after the war, because of her English lang -- English knowledge, she got a job in a little town someplace in Germany, to help displaced persons, from all over Europe, of different nationalities. And she became responsible for - I believe, if I remember well, for 8,000 people, and got a very responsible, big job there. One day she got -- she was asked by a German doctor, whether she would come with him to inspect a ward of sick people in the hospital, which was also in that same s -- 1n that same area where she worked. And when they entered a ward, a woman attacked her verbally and physically in Polish, and told her, \u201cYou are Jewish, you should not be alive. You killed Christ.\u201d With this one sentence, this Polish woman told the whole story. The curse on the Jewish people, which is a historical injustice, carrying on through centuries, which culminated this time in the Holocaust, but there were many events prior to that. You can look at the Inquisition, the Crusades, at individual abuses of fuhrer, masters in Europe, in Russia, all over. Wherever Christianity was the main religion. And never was anything done on the side of the church, to dispel these wrong rumors, even up to today. Whatever that Pope has done up to now, is by far not enough. I think the church owes us an apology. They should -- stop it, please -- they should admit, confess, and atone for what they have done. I think this is what they owe us, and it would also elevate the moral standing of the church, which up to today is only hiding and el -- and not coming out s -- directly of what happened. There\u2019s another interesting thing which came into my mind. Protestantism was founded in Germany at least, by Martin Luther. Martin Luther originally protested against the abuses of the church, by being bought off for money, and ultimately was the founder of the Protestant movement in Germany. Although he was sensitive to what the abuses of the church, he took with him the anti-Semitism of the church, by putting his feces on the church, I believe, in Brittenburg, where he asked for the banishment of the Jews unless they became Christians, and of their -- of killing them, which is very interesting, and that only sh -- tells me how great and how deep the belief of the Jewish guilt was implanted in not only the population, but also among the intellectuals of the church itself."

            "answer": "I -- I do not believe that anything like that would be possible again, and I want to emphasize today, in my own mind, a tremendous change in government -- in government forming of -- of laws. Originally, if a government persecuted people, oppressed people, killed people, nobody interfered. At best -- There was an article in the paper, thanks to the courage of our President Clinton, and to NATO, that a change in this attitude finally came about, when we declared war on Milosevitch, who was oppressing his own people, and abusing the other minorities within Yugoslavia. This is a historical event of tremendous impact for the future. And I think we should call this the Clinton Doctrine. I am -- I am highly impressed and very satisfied and happy that this happened, not because- not because of myself, but in general terms, for the sake of mankind."

There is still a dispute whether he is guilty or not guilty for killing people during the time when he was in power.

            "answer": "Well, I believe that a few sensitive people might have been influenced by the tremen - by the terrific injustice which happened during the second World War, toward the Jewish people, and those who resisted the Nazi doctrines. But generally speaking, if -- if NATO, under the leadership of Clintons, wouldn\u2019t have done what they have done, the thing could have been again forgotten. As a matter of fact, from what I have been listening, to stories about the -- memorials about the Holocaust and so forth, nobody ever touched the church, which is guilty just as much as the Germans themselves, for what has happened."

            "answer": "Oh, I -- I can tell you as far as the religion is concerned, I personally believe that religions were necessary to raise the standards, the moral standards of the population. Whatever abuses happened later on, by trying to exert power over their own people, and oppress others, this is a different story. Personally, I was raised in a home -- in a Jewish home, by birth, but we were not religious. We kept a kosher house, because of my father\u2019s father, who was a widower. When he passed away, 1n his early 80\u2019s, my sister and myself said, \u201cMom, let\u2019s stop that kosher deal, we want to eat everything.\u201d And that was the end of the kosher household. Personally, I believe that Moses himself was one of the greatest, if not the greatest statesman, by inventing the 10 commandments and giving them to the people as a guide for morality, for life. And I also am convinced that Jesus, another Jew, was another very great man, great statesman, who spread the teachings of Judaism in his own way, as a Reformer of Judaism rather than sticking to the old ways of the Jewish religion."

And anything else is just an individual need. Some people need to believe that they will go to heaven after they die. I believe that I will go -- after I die, will be either co -- cremated, and that will be the end of -- because I don\u2019t believe in -- either in heaven, nor in a purgatory."

There were, according to the chronicle which I read, long before the war, but which I cannot locate now, and I tried to ask people to find it, there were originally, in 1492, that was the year when Columbus discovered America, three Jewish families living in Boskovice, under the castle. Their name was Horvald, Stefanski, and Ticho. The-There are very interesting things. One of the people who survived the war, was Mr. Ignatz Horvald, who was married to a Gentile woman, and he was, at that time, when the war broke out, he must have been in the late 60\u2019s or early 70\u2019s and somehow the Germans didn\u2019t even intern him, at the end of the war, what they did to every other member of a mixed marriage. He survived, and he lived in the same section, which is mentioned in the chronic, under the castle. Now, at my time, there were my family Ticho, then there was a company of the name Brothers Ticho, which was owned by two brothers of a family of 13 children, two daughters and 11 sons. They were not related to us, we did not acknowledge any relationship between us. Then there was a third Ticho, Max Ticho senior. To distinguish it from my father, Max Ticho junior, who was the son of George Ticho, who also did not acknowledge any relationship to the other two Ticho families.

When I came back after the war, I tried to find Otto, whether he came back into his native town of Chabeetch, in Moravia, but nobody knew of him, so he must have perished during the war."

And one of the -- one of the strings attached were that the Jews have to go to Jewish school -- to German schools, to help Germanize the non-German speaking regions. Now, Boskovice was about 8,000 people, of which there were probably 350 - 400 Jews. There were more deported, because many came from other towns at the time of the deportation, to Boskovice. So we spoke at home- my father had only Jewish -- German schooling. My mother had German and Hungarian schooling, because she came from Slovakia, which was under the jurisdiction of the Hungarians. And I considered myself a pure Czechoslovakian because my mother was Slovak and my father was Czech. I am the only Czechoslovakian who escaped and survived Sobibor. I don\u2019t know how we came to this. Yeah, the -- the historical reason why we -- we spoke German, but in 1918, when Czechoslovakia was formed and I was four years old, there was still a German school. But in 1920, the German school was closed, and by the way, it was not attended only by Jewish children, z -- but also by some Gentile children, whose parents wanted them to learn German.

            "answer": "The first thing what I want to mention 1s that when I was translating the letter to the director of the museum in Boskovice, that the word which I was missing, which actually is the deed, when the church was selling what it\u2019s called indagencies, to those who sinned, and were buying off their -- their sinning. That\u2019s number one, number two, when I was translating that same letter, I omitted, I believe one sentence, which I definitely want to repeat, namely, when I say that Christianity 1s a noble religion, which will be here for eternity. And now, if you allow me, I would like to start to read two letters from Theodora Toidya Cobaletska, that\u2019s her -- that\u2019s her married name, the daughter of the farmer, which she wrote me on my inquiries in the 90\u2019s, what happened during my stay there, which I could not know, because I couldn\u2019t get out, and after I left. All right then. Here is the first letter from Toidya, dating into September 19, 1993. \u201cDear Kurt, in reference to your letters of March 15 and August third, 1993, I am conveying to you information regarding my parents and my family. My mother Anna Pocharlie, nee Lipa, was born April 15, n -- 1890, in Wallagarja Nitzca, near Pableshk Piaski lubareska, while my father, Stanislav Pocharlie, son of Michael and Maryanna, was born on April 21, n -- 1890, in Sialishky, near Piaski lubareska. Together they will work as farmers on their farm in Sialishky. Through their own daily work, they managed to acquire a larger farm, and until Hitler\u2019s German invasion of Poland, in September 1900 and 39, they were leading farmers in the village. After that, my father worked simultaneously in the Casa Shef-Shef-Shefsheek Savings Bank in Piaski. The invaders ran a wasteful, exploi- exploitative regime and the for -- the for -- their forced deliveries of goods ruined the Polish countryside. The invaders ran a wasteful and exploit-ploitative regime and the forced deli-deliveries of goods ruined the Polish countryside. Not fulfilling the quotas was cruelly punished by the German administration, with arrests, and with sending people to concentration camps. The period of the German occupation was a brutal time, a time of violence and terror. There was a lack of food, and the basic food articles were distributed by means of ration cards. I remember that Mama used to prepare a syrup from sugar beets, and we sweetened our black coffee with it. There were times when there wasn\u2019t even flour for bread, which Mama baked herself. Our basic diet was milk and potatoes. Thanks to the resourcefulness of my father, there was never any real hunger. I remember the day when you came to us at night. My father warned Mother not to give you any food that was too fatty or excessively rich during the first few days of your stay with us. After the camp food, it might have caused serious health consequences for your stomach and your whole digestive system. At that time it was not easy to get medicines and curing you would have been made significantly more difficult under the conditions of your concealment. I want to mention that my parents were afraid f -- of the neighbors, who were numerous around our farmyard. A woman by the name of Fran-Franechka, who was very nosy, was specially dangerous. She loved to look after -- around everywhere, in the outbuildings, and tell the whole village what was going on around there. For that reason also, we had to maintain the greatest possible vigilance of all costs. After that, there was a young girl in our house, by the make of Kriska, who was with us as a helper in the housekeeping. Her mother asked my father whether she could work for him so that she could be registered in our community. Wer -- This registration saved her from being carried off to forced labor with the Germans. I remember also a conversation of my father with his brother, who likewise lived in Sialishky, who told father that a neighbor had told him that there was someone hiding in our outbuildings, because one night you could hear coughing. This information from his brother made my father very uneasy and he told you about this occurrence, indicating that he would have to change your place of hiding. Father,\u201d -- pardon me, he didn\u2019t tell me about that, but he said that I should not cough, but he didn\u2019t tell me why. I -- I had no -- I had no idea about the reason. \u201cFather and Mother were considering how to do this in order to create safe conditions for your further stay in hiding. With that goal in mind, both of them went to Mama\u2019s brother, who was living in the village of Wallagardianitska, about six kilometers from Sialishky, in order to discuss with him the matter of transporting you to that locality and of concealing you at his farm, but that event turned out differently. It happened that my mother\u2019s brother was being sought by the Germans and had to hide himself as well. In that situation, Dad and Mama decided that you would remain further at the place in Sialishky, whatever the consequences. In regard to Kriska, you -- who had seen you in the barn, Dad explained to her, if I remember correctly, that you were one of the partisans, who was hiding there. It goes without saying that it was impossible to let her know who you were, and in the interest of the safety of all of us. Apparently, she must have believed Dad\u2019s explanation, because, as it turned out, the matter never came to public attention. Further -- Fortunately, as you know, we endured those hard times and lived to see the liberation. For us, the day of liberation, which came in our area in the second half of July, 1944,\u201d -- it was rather at the very end of July -- \u201cwas a special day. It was possible for you to leave your hiding place, and you were able to return to a normal life. We were overcome with great joy. That which had seemed an impossible thing, had become a reality. Our faith and confidence, in the help of God, and also our prayers had been answered. After your departure from Sialishky, at the end of July, 1944, we continued to be uneasy about whether you had made it in s -- in safe and sound to your home in Czechoslovakia. Your letter, sent from the ship Queen Elizabeth,\u201d-- but it should be Queen Mary -- \u201csaying that you were alive and on your way to United States was an enormous comfort to us, and finally permitted our hearts to be at ease. We were able to think about you -- your new life, with a feeling of relief, and to wish that it would be a happy one. Our country was free from under Hitler\u2019s occupation and we thought that the peaceful life would now en-ensue. In the meantime, from the very beginning, there were starting to be arrests, death sentences and deportations to prison camps deep in the Soviet Union, from which many Poles never again returned to their country. They a -- They arrested members of the National Army, and those who did not accept the new political order. A difficult period for the Polish society had begun. Many innocent people died during the consolidation of the people\u2019s government. The truth about these times of violence and repression has just recently begun to come to light, little by little. In September \u00b044, my father was arrested on the charge of possession of weapons and of concealing partisans. In our home, a rigorous inspection was carried out by functionaries of the Bureau of Security. Mama and I were terrified and beside ourselves at the thought of what would become to us in the future. At a certain time, Mama and I left our home and possessions. Our neighbors took care of the entire farm during our absence. Such a situation could not continue, however, and our return to Sialishky was necessary, without regard to the consequences. That was a very difficult time for us. The Bureau of Security, after many interrogations, was not able to prove the charges they had brought against my father, that his possessions of arm, and concerning partisans. Father did not return home until December fi -- \u00b044. However, there was not any further peace. Difficult times began to wealthy farmers, so-called kulaks, by the people\u2019s government. My father was likewise accounted as one of these kulaks. Extremely high tax charges and mandatory deliveries of agricultural produ-produce, and livestock, were imposed by the office of the community, aimed at liquidating the so-called kulak farms. If the farmers did not comply with the community prohibitions, they were e -- threatened with serious penal consequences. With hard labor, my parents endured even this hostile rate of taxation, of the people\u2019s government, or wealthy farmers. They worked on their farm until advanced old age. My parents did not want to leave Sialishky, here they had their family, neighbors, their home and their free life. On the other hand, being with us in Lublin, they were condemned, as it were, to idleness, to a lack of -- to a lack of neighbors with whom they had lived together, or a -- great part of their lives, and to lack of all of that which surrounded them in the village. Simply put, they never 1m-imagined a life in town for themselves, and I am not surprised, because the link with their environment, which accompanied them almost throughout their lives, was so strong that it could not be broken. My father, right after Mom\u2019s death, when we wanted to bring them to Lublin, put off his arrival for month, two months, and not until December, did he decide to come to our home in Lublin. While he was with us, he was extremely homesick for Sialishky, and it might be that the homesickness and idleness hastened his death. Mom died June 28\", \u201971, in Sialishky, and Father on April 1972, in Lublin. They are both buried in the cemetery in Piaski. I want to mention that I have been married since December 31, 1945, and from the start, I lived in Piaski, and worked there initially, in the cooperative agricultural market, afterwards in the cooperative savings bank, and later, after bringing up the children, in the post office. There was always frequent contact with my parents, especially during the times of intensified field labor. All my family [indecipherable] these jobs. Our children spent July and August vacations in Sialishky, and to the extent they could, helped their grandparents with the harvest. Myself and my husband, who likewise are work in Piaski, took a leave of absence at the time, and spent it working on my parents farm. In 1966, we obtained an apartment in Lublin, in Kalanovsheesna Street, and a new phase of our life began for us. My son Andre finished at that time, the [indecipherable] technical school. My daughter Alsberta finished liberal arts gymnas-gymnasium, college preparatory high school, and the younger daughter, Eva, went into the second class of basic school. I, after coming to Lublin, have been working continuously at the post office in Piaski, which allowed me to be continuous -- in continuous contact with my parents, to whose house I used to ride after work on my bicycle, about three to six kilometers from Piaski to Sialishky. At that time, my parents were already over 76 years old, and had less and less edj -- energy to work. They sold part of their land because they were no longer in any condition to manage it, and earlier -- and -- and earlier, a part of the land had been sold to pay taxes imposed yearly by the people\u2019s government of the community. They were on what remained of their farm right up to Mom\u2019s death. My father, after the final liquidation on the farm, came to our house in Lublin in December \u201971. All my family hold them in fond memory. They were people of high moral le-level, upon whom it was all -- always possible to depend. Their most particular character trait was kindness and fondness for the family, and that was felt in every step in their contact with us. For that reason also, our children were always very eager to be with them, and received each announcement of a trip to Sialishky with joy. For us and our children, my parents home was always an oasis of peace and joy, where everyone always felt happy and secure. That resulted in their positive influence on our hearts and minds, and arose from their deep faith in the values of the Christian teaching, on which they were followers. Kindness, tolerance, and mutual respect. My parents and all of us were eager to see you after years, once again in Sialishky, but that has turned out to be impossible. I think that this will come true to a certain degree with your meeting with your son -- with our son Andre and his family al- although in America, where they have been living permanently since September 1988. May he represent those who have already departed from this world, my dear parents and us all, living in this country. We have the hope that this meeting will take place.

            "answer": "Lam now continuing with the follow up letter after receiving the first one, I wrote her and this is the answer, dated Lublin, December the 17, 1993. \u201cDear Kurt. In reference to your letter of November seventh and to the information which I sent you in a letter on September 19, I would like to finish describing those events that I still remember from that letter. I began working at S-Spudsyairna rawneecho handlovay in Piaski in September, \u201941, and my work there prevented me from being taken to a forced labor camp in Germany. In the fall, and especially during the winter, I frequently spent the nights in Piaski, and during the spring and summer, I often came home to -- by bike. I was in Piaski the day you arrived at my parent\u2019s home, on October 18, 1943. The next day my mother came to me and told me about your arrival and that same day I came to Sialishky and we were tell -- talking. I believe roo -- you remember that moment.\u201d I don\u2019t remember that she was talking to me, that Toidya was ta-talking to me. \u201cI stopped working at the Sporgiana and came home to live with my parents with my father -- when my father took me from Piaski. This happened when the Germans and Soviet armies were approaching our village. During this time, attacks from wa-war planes, were intensifying, which were bombing German regiments and fleeing Germans and has set Piaski aflame. At that time, retreating German er -- regiments and civilians, referred as to the Volksdeutsch, had penetrated into the village, took horses and anything else they could, and fled west. I and several other people from the village, took our horses from the stables and we ran off in the meadows to prevent the Germans army from requisi -- requisitioning our horses. We spent the night in the fields, in the bushes, where we safely waited until the morning. The German army horse corp, and along with them civilians, arrived in our yard that same night. Many farmers ran off into their meadows, whereas my parents and our neighbor, Adam Smoleara remained in the building. In the morning my mother came and told us not to return home yet. We returned to the village only in the afternoon, once the Germans left. As we later discovered, rebels from the Polish underground army ambushed them outside of Piaski. Most likely they were Germans and Ukrainians. A portion of them who survived, returned to Sialishky and ordered us to leave our buildings because the Soviet army was going to occupy them. My parents quickly loaded the wagon with foods and clothes, and at that time, informed the military personnel that the messengers from the village went to the commander in Piaski to verify whether this order was reliable. They were surprised by this information and shortly afterwards, left the village. Our village is located between two main roads, which when leaving Piaski, one leads to Holm and the other one to Zamosc. The Polish and Soviet armies were advancing on the road to Holm from Piaski, where the German\u2019s army was retreating likewise it on the road from Piaski to Zamosc toward Lublin. Both sides were exchanging machine gun fire from both Jal and the highest point -- from both Jal and the highest point in Sialishky. The villages, Drizishky, Drazitchae, Jelltov and Piaski, and the surrounding area were aflame, but our village was preserved. During this shoot out, we were sitting in a man -- manhole across from our residence, that was dug up by my father Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection and our neighbor Alexander Pasternak. In your hi -- In our hiding pl -- In your hiding place, there was another exit through the attic into Pasternak\u2019s shed, that led to the meadow. My father explained to me that in case of any danger, you could have run away by opening the door of -- to the unlocked shed. After the German army retreated beyond Lublin, I decided to turn to work in Piaski. That was at the end of July 44. The day you left our house, I was at work. In my father\u2019s opinion, the main roads [indecipherable] Piaski Lublin was the safest and directed toward the road, because that was where the Polish and Soviet regiments were located. On the side road, Sialishky Pershki, there were many deserters dressed as civilians, of whom my father was suspicious, so he decided to lead you to the road beyond the yard, that led to the main road.\u201d That is not so in my memory, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cYou asked in your letter 1f anyone heard you coughing. That was our neighbor, Adam Smalleara, who walked by your hiding place to his farm buildings every day. He told his neighbor Constanti Pocharlie about the coughing in your -- in our buildings. He was my father\u2019s brother and frequently came to our home. The next thing you asked is where my mother and I were when we left our home in Sialishky after my father was arrested, and who took care of our farm. My father stayed with the si -- her sister, who lived in Volla Garjanitska village, and I stayed with my cousin in Lublin. In our absence, my father\u2019s brother, Constanti Pocharlie and his wife Elixa, who resided in Sialishky, and lived near us, took care of our farm. They informed us through acquaintances that it was possible to return to Sialishky. Was Kriska in Sialishky? She did not live there. She was from Walla Posi -- Biasetska village, a municipality of Piaski. Some information about my family.

            "answer": "Really, it was nothing dramatic. The most dramatic thing was when I wanted to visit the graves of my late grandparents, my father\u2019s mother and father, Josef and Rosaria Ticho. They had two very nice tombstones, and before I went to America, I erected a plate -- a marble plate, which was affixed on the two tombstones, in which I remembered my parents and my sister, that they perished on June the 234, 1942, in Sobibor. The stones were -- were -- f-f-fell down and -- no, at that time they were still there. No, at that time they were already gone. It was -- The stones were f -- laying flat on the ground and the tablet was torn off, and I could not -- I did not know that I need a key to get into the cemetery and I didn\u2019t even know wh-who the key -- who the -- would have the key. I crawled over the fence, into the cemetery, and that was the most dramatic thing on -- on the whole trip. As a matter of fact, we went first to -- where did we go first? First to 3 Hungary, and stayed in Budapest, and my friend Rudolf Hurlinger, with his wife Inga, who live in California -- she unfortunately died a few months ago -- went on a trip with a group. And as it happened, they also went to Hungary, to Budapest, and also to Vienna, and also to Czechoslovakia. And we, my wife and myself, we were on our own. So we happened to meet in Budapest, in the hotel, and when I was leaving with Gloria, the -- their room, I took the elevator, and in the elevator I see a man, and I look at him, and I says, \u201cSir, aren\u2019t you a senator of the United States?\u201d And he shook my hand, and he says, \u201cI am Sam Nunn, and this is my son.\u201d He introduced me in the elevator, and that was the day when Yeltsin stopped that tank in Moscow, during the revolution there. And I says to him, \u201cYou know, Senator, we were lucky in -- in Russia.\u201d He says, \u201cI just came from there, and we were really lucky.\u201d And in the meantime the elevator stopped on the first floor, and there were people waiting for him already, downstairs. That was in Budapest, and then we met again in -- in Vienna, and then we met again in Bernau."

And they tortured their people for religious and political reasons, but it wasn\u2019t accessible, so we decided instead, and took a cab and went to the Matzocra, which are limestone caverns, built by -- partly by the water seeping through from the outside, and there\u2019s also a river on which you go on the little 4 boat called Punqua, which was very interesting, that we spent together there with Rudy and Inga.

And then in Prague, we met again with Rudy and Inga. And we stayed downtown in a hotel, and they stayed on the outskirts in a hotel, with -- with was originally built during the Communist system for Communist\u2019s functionaries only. It was a luxurious place, I went there, with every amenity you can imagine, with terraces in front of the rooms. And they stayed there for two or three nights and we stayed, as I said in the -- in downtown. And there I met one of my school chums, from high school, Rudolf Bubla, who helped us in Prague. He was a very nice fellow, who became a professional officer of the Czechoslovak army, and then I found out later on, when I met him after the war, in Prague, how terrible all these officer were treated. He worked in a coal mine for years, because he was a officer of the Czech army during the occupation of the Germans."
