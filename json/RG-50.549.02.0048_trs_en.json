            "answer": "No, I don\u2122t question any more, I think that I have my answers. I think I have my answers. I feel that the German nation was misled, and that there is not only -- there are USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 4 two entities who are guilty of mass murder. We know of the executioners, it was Hitler\u2122s political cronies, who went along with him, to eliminate the Jewish people wherever he could get them. But anti-Semitism was -- or racism, whatever you want to call it, goes back centuries, many centuries, and the original sin was committed by Christians, by the church, which actually propagated, I woul d say the -- the persecutions of Jews, by accusing the Jewish people of whatever was convenient for them. For instance, up to today, the idea that the Jews killed Christ, prevails within a large segment of people who do not know history. It is kno wn, for instance, that the crucifixion was an act of erga -- Romans. It was their law by which they -- by whic h they sentenced people to death. The Jews stoned. And I want to tell you a very inte resting story. I met, a year ago, a lady of the name Anna Rubenstein, who wrote a couple books, I believe three books. She a foo -- survivor of Auschwitz, and after the war, because of her English lang -- English knowledge, she got a job in a little town someplace in Germany, to help displaced persons, from all over Europe, of different nationalities. And she became responsible for -- I believe, if I remember well, for 8,000 people, and got a very responsible, big job there. One day she got -- she was asked by a German doctor, whether she would come with him to inspect a ward of sick people in the hospital, which was also in that same s -- in that same area where she worked. And when they entered a ward, a woman attacked her verbally and physically in Polish, and told he r, \ufb01You are Jewish, you should not be alive. You killed Christ.\ufb02 With this one sentence, this Polish woman told the whole story. The curse on the Jewish people, which is a historical injustice, carryi ng on through centuries, which culminated this time in the Holocaust, but there were many events prior to that. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 5 You can look at the Inquisition, the Crusades, at individual abuses of f\u00fchrer, masters in Europe, in Russia, all over. Wherever Christianity was the main religion. And never was anything done on the side of th e church, to dispel these wrong rumors, even up to today. Whatever that Pope has done up to now, is by far not enough. I think the church owes us an apology. They should -- stop it, please -- they should admit, confess, and atone for what they have done. I think this is what they owe us, and it would also elevate the moral standing of the church, which up to today is only hiding and el -- and not coming out s -- directly of what happened. There\u2122s another interesting thing which came into my mind. Protestantism was founded in Germany at least, by Mar tin Luther. Martin Luther originally protested against the abuses of the church, by being bought off for money, and ultimately was the founder of the Protestant movement in Germany. Although he was sensitive to what the abuses of the church, he took with him the anti-Semitism of the church, by putting his feces on the church, I believe, in Brittenburg, where he asked for the banishment of the Jews unless they became Christians, and of their -- of killing them, which is very interesting, and that only sh -- tells me how great and how deep the belief of the Jewish guilt was implanted in not only the population, but also among the intellectuals of the church itself."

            "answer": "Well, I believe that a few sensitive people might have been influenced by the tremen - by the terrific injustice which happened during the second World War, toward the Jewish people, and those who resisted the Nazi doctrines. But generally speaking, if -- if NATO, under the leadership of Clintons, wouldn\u2122t have done what they have done, the thing could have been again forgotten. As a matter of fact, from what I have been listening, to stories about the -- memorials about the Holocaust and so forth, nobody ever touched the church, which is guilty just as much as the Germans themselves, for what has happened."

            "answer": "Oh, I -- I can tell you as far as the religion is concerned, I personally believe that religions were necessary to raise the standards, the moral standards of the population. Whatever abuses happened later on, by trying to exert power over their own people, and oppress others, this is a different story. Personally, I was raised in a home -- in a Jewish home, by birth, but we were not religious . We kept a kosher house, because of my father\u2122s father, who was a widower. When he passed away, in his early 80\u2122s, my sister and myself said, \ufb01Mom, let\u2122s stop that kosher de al, we want to eat everything.\ufb02 And that was the end of the kosher household. Persona lly, I believe that Moses himself was one of the greatest, if not the greatest statesman, by inventing the 10 commandments and giving USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 8 them to the people as a guide for morality, for life. And I also am convinced that Jesus, another Jew, was another very great man, gr eat statesman, who spread the teachings of Judaism in his own way, as a Reformer of Juda ism rather than sticking to the old ways of the Jewish religion."

Now since I knew that Jewish people can be sick now for three days, as soon as somebody was not able to go to work -- prior to the point of course, if you couldn\u2122t be able to -- if you were not able to go to work, they took you what they called in the -- into the Lazarette, and they shot you. Pardon me. So I wrote down, for instance, Arwin Donohue got sick on June the 22nd. So you -- w-we --were legally sick, allowed to be USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 18 sick, 22 - 23 - 24.

And then, as we walked toward the -- this stable, the horse stable and the cow stable, he said to me, \ufb01I owe you some money.\ufb02 From that you can see what an honest person he was.

And I said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 Because I figured out right away if I would have tell -- told him that we are two, that my chances would be even smaller. Today I know that I wa s thinking of Otto, but he was thinking of Emmie, my friend from Piaski, who once in awhile came out onto his farm in summer, and sunned herself on the lawn someplace, and then in the evening we went back together into the ghetto. And he wanted probably to know whether Emmie is with me. That -- That\u2122s where the misunderstanding, and it came into my mind only much later. Anyhow, we came to that stable. He says to me, \ufb01You wait here,\ufb02 and went out and locked it from the outside -- the door from the outside. I c ouldn\u2122t get out. After awhile he came back. Brought me a bottle of hot -- hot tea, or hot coffee, if you may -- want to call it coffee, it was chicory with milk.

So that he gave me, and he spread on the f -- on the floor, in the straw there, a little home-woven carpet and said, \ufb01I come to see you in the morning,\ufb02 and locked the door from the outside, and that was it. I had no way to get back to Otto. Early in the morning, he took me -- he opened the door from the stable and took me across the ya -- across the yard in the barn and says, \ufb01Crawl up there someplace and hide.\ufb02 Which I did. In the afternoon, when I was really rested, I came down, and later on, Mrs. Pocharlie came with USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 24 another bottle of hot tea and two big slices of rye bread with lard. And that was the first food I had on that day. And she told me th at at night, partisans came and wanted their bicycle.

When I came back af ter the war, I tried to find Otto, whether he came back into his native town of Chabeetch, in Moravia, but nobody knew of him, so he must have perished during the war."

Now, Boskovice was about 8,000 people, of which there were probably 350 - 400 Jews. There were more deported, because many came from other towns at the time of the deportation, to Boskovice. So we spoke at home -- my father had only Jewish -- German schooling. My mother had German and Hungarian schooling, because she came from Slovakia, which was under the jurisdiction of the Hungarians. And I considered myself a pure Czechoslovakian because my mother was Slovak and my father was Czech. I am the only Czechoslovakian who escaped and survived Sobib\u00f3r.

All right then. Here is the first letter from Toidya, dating into September 19, 1993. \ufb01Dear Kurt, in reference to your letters of March 15 and August third, 1 993, I am conveying to you information regarding my parents and my family. My mother Anna Pocharlie, nee Lipa, was born April 15, n -- 1890, in Wallagarja Nitz ca, near Pableshk Piaski lubareska, while my father, Stanislav Pocharlie, son of Michael and Maryanna, was born on April 21 st, n -- 1890, in Sialishky, near Piaski lubareska. To gether they will work as farmers on their farm in Sialishky. Through their own daily wo rk, they managed to acquire a larger farm, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 78 and until Hitler\u2122s German invasion of Poland, in September 1900 and 39, they were leading farmers in the village. After that, my father worked simultaneously in the Casa Shef-Shef-Shefsheek Savings Bank in Piaski . The invaders ran a wasteful, exploi-exploitative regime and the for -- the for -- their forced deliveries of goods ruined the Polish countryside. The invaders ran a wasteful and exploit-ploitative regime and the forced deli-deliveries of goods ruined the Polish countryside. Not fulfilling the quotas was cruelly punished by the German administration, with arrests, and with sending people to concentration camps. The period of the German occupation was a brutal time, a time of violence and terror. There was a lack of food, and the basic food articles were distributed by means of ration cards. I remember that Mama used to prepare a syrup from sugar beets, and we sweetened our black coffee with it. There were times when there wasn\u2122t even flour for bread, which Mama baked herself. Our basic diet was milk and potatoes. Thanks to the resourcefulness of my father, there was never any real hunger. I remember the day when you came to us at night. My father warned Mother not to give you any food that was too fatty or excessively ri ch during the first few days of your stay with us. After the camp food, it might have caused serious health consequences for your stomach and your whole digestive system. At th at time it was not easy to get medicines and curing you would have b een made significantly more difficult under the conditions of your concealment. I want to mention that my parents were afraid f -- of the neighbors, who were numerous around our farmyard. A woman by the name of Fran-Franechka, who was very nosy, was specially dangerous. She loved to look after -- around everywhere, in the outbuildings, and tell the whole village what was going on around USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 79 there. For that reason also, we had to maintain the greatest possible vigilance of all costs. After that, there was a young girl in our house, by the make of Kriska, who was with us as a helper in the housekeepin g. Her mother asked my father whether she could work for him so that she could be registered in our community. Wer -- This registration saved her from being carried off to forced labor with the Germans. I remember also a conversation of my father with his brother, who likewise lived in Sialishky, who told father that a neighbor had told him that there was someone hiding in our outbuildings, because one night you could hear coughing. This informa tion from his brother made my father very uneasy and he told you about th is occurrence, indicating that he would have to change your place of hiding. Father,\ufb02 -- pardon me, he didn\u2122t tell me about that, but he said that I should not cough, but he didn\u2122t tell me why. I -- I had no -- I had no idea about the reason. \ufb01Father and Mother were considering how to do this in order to create safe conditions for your further stay in hiding. With that goal in mind, both of them went to Mama\u2122s brother, who was living in the village of Wallagardianitska, about six kilometers from Sialishky, in order to discuss with him the matter of transporting you to that locality and of concealing you at his farm, but that event turned out differently. It happened that my mother\u2122s brother was being sought by th e Germans and had to hide himself as well. In that situation, Dad and Mama decided that you would remain further at the place in Sialishky, whatever the consequences. In regard to Kriska , you -- who had seen you in the barn, Dad explained to her, if I remember correctly, that you were one of the partisans, who was hiding there. It goes w ithout saying that it was impossible to let her know who you were, and in the interest of th e safety of all of us. Apparently, she must USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 80 have believed Dad\u2122s explanati on, because, as it turned out, the matter never came to public attention. Further -- Fortunately, as you know, we endured those hard times and lived to see the liberation. For us, the day of liberation, which came in our area in the second half of July, 1944,\ufb02 -- it was rather at the very end of July -- \ufb01was a special day. It was possible for you to leave your hiding place, and you were able to return to a normal life. We were overcome with great joy. That which had seemed an impossible thing, had become a reality. Our faith and confidence, in the help of God, and also our prayers had been answered. After your departure from Si alishky, at the end of July, 1944, we continued to be uneasy about whether you had made it in s -- in safe and sound to your home in Czechoslovakia. Your letter, sent fro m the ship Queen Elizabeth,\ufb02-- but it should be Queen Mary -- \ufb01saying that you were alive and on your way to United States was an enormous comfort to us, and finally permitted our hearts to be at ease. We were able to think about you -- your new life, with a feeli ng of relief, and to wish that it would be a happy one. Our country was free from under Hitler\u2122s occupation and we thought that the peaceful life would now en-ensue. In the mean time, from the very beginning, there were starting to be arrests, death sentences and deportations to prison camps deep in the Soviet Union, from which many Poles never again retu rned to their country. They a -- They arrested members of the National Army, and those who did not accept the new political order. A difficult period for the Polish societ y had begun. Many innocent people died during the consolidation of the people\u2122s go vernment. The truth about these times of violence and repression has just recently begun to come to light, little by little. In September \u201a44, my father was arrested on the charge of possession of weapons and of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 81 concealing partisans. In our home, a rigorous inspection was carried out by functionaries of the Bureau of Security. Mama and I were terrified and beside ourselves at the thought of what would become to us in the future. At a certain time, Mama and I left our home and possessions. Our neighbors took care of th e entire farm during our absence. Such a situation could not continue, however, and our return to Si alishky was necessary, without regard to the consequences. That was a very difficult time for us. The Bureau of Security, after many interrogations, was not able to prove the charges they had brought against my father, that his possessions of arm, and concer ning partisans. Father did not return home until December fi -- \u212244. However, there was not any further peace. Difficult times began to wealthy farmers, so-called kulaks, by the people\u2122s government. My father was likewise accounted as one of these kulaks. Extremely high tax charges and mandatory deliveries of agricultural produ-produce, and livestock, we re imposed by the office of the community, aimed at liquidating the so-called kulak farm s. If the farmers did not comply with the community prohibitions, they were e -- threatened with serious penal consequences. With hard labor, my parents endured even this hostile rate of taxation, of the people\u2122s government, or wealthy farmers. They worked on their farm until advanced old age. My parents did not want to leave Sialishky, here they had thei r family, neighbors, their home and their free life. On the other hand, being with us in Lublin, they were condemned, as it were, to idleness, to a lack of -- to a lack of neighbors with whom they had lived together, or a -- great part of their lives, and to lack of all of that which surrounded them in the village. Simply put, they never im-imagined a life in town for themselves, and I am not surprised, because the link with their environment, which accompanied them almost USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 82 throughout their lives, was so strong that it could not be broken. My father, right after Mom\u2122s death, when we wanted to bring them to Lublin, put off his arrival for month, two months, and not until December, did he decide to come to our home in Lublin. While he was with us, he was extremely homesick for Sialishky, and it might be that the homesickness and idleness hastened his death. Mom died June 28 th, \u212271, in Sialishky, and Father on April 1972, in Lublin. They are both buried in the cemetery in Piaski. I want to mention that I have been married since Decem ber 31, 1945, and from the start, I lived in Piaski, and worked there initially, in the cooperative agricultural market, afterwards in the cooperative savings bank, and later, after bringing up the children, in the post office. There was always frequent contact with my parents, especially during the times of intensified field labor. All my family [indecipherable] these jobs. Our children spent July and August vacations in Sialishky, and to the extent they could, help ed their grandparents with the harvest. Myself and my husband, who likewise are work in Piaski, took a leave of absence at the time, and spent it working on my parents farm. In 1966, we obtained an apartment in Lublin, in Kalanovsheesna Street, and a new phase of our life began for us. My son Andre finished at that time, the [i ndecipherable] technical school. My daughter Alsberta finished liberal arts gymnas-gymna sium, college preparatory high school, and the younger daughter, Eva, went into the se cond class of basic school. I, after coming to Lublin, have been working con tinuously at the post office in Piaski, which allowed me to be continuous -- in continuous contact with my parents, to whose house I used to ride after work on my bicycle, about three to six kilometers from Pi aski to Sialishky. At that time, my parents were already over 76 years old, and had less and less edj -- energy to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 83 work. They sold part of their land because they were no longer in any condition to manage it, and earlier -- and -- an d earlier, a part of the land had been sold to pay taxes imposed yearly by the people\u2122s government of the community. They were on what remained of their farm right up to Mom\u2122s death. My father, after the final liquidation on the farm, came to our house in Lublin in De cember \u212271. All my family hold them in fond memory. They were people of high moral le-level, upon whom it was all -- always possible to depend. Their most particular character trait was kindness and fondness for the family, and that was felt in every step in their contact with us. For that reason also, our children were always very eager to be with them, and received each announcement of a trip to Sialishky with joy. For us and our children, my parents home was always an oasis of peace and joy, where everyone always felt happy and secure. That resulted in their positive influence on our hearts and minds, and arose from their deep faith in the values of the Christian teaching, on which they were followers. Kindness, tolerance, and mutual respect. My parents and all of us were eager to see you after years, once again in Sialishky, but that has turned out to be impossi ble. I think that this will come true to a certain degree with your meeting with your son -- with our son Andre and his family alalthough in America, where they have been living permanently since September 1988. May he represent those who have already departed from this world, my dear parents and us all, living in this country. We have the hope that this meeting will take place.

In reference to your letter of November seve nth and to the information wh ich I sent you in a letter on September 19, I would like to finish describing those events that I still remember from that letter. I began working at S-Spudsyairna rawneecho handlovay in Piaski in September, \u212241, and my work there prevented me from being taken to a forced labor camp in Germany. In the fall, and especially during the winter, I frequently spent the nights in Piaski, and during the spring an d summer, I often came home to -- by bike. I was in Piaski the day you arrived at my pa rent\u2122s home, on October 18, 1943. The next day my mother came to me and told me about your arrival and that same day I came to Sialishky and we were tell -- talking. I believe roo -- you remember that moment.\ufb02 I don\u2122t remember that she was talking to me, that Toidya was ta-talking to me. \ufb01I stopped working at the Sporgiana and came home to liv e with my parents with my father -- when my father took me from Piaski. This happened when the Germ ans and Soviet armies were approaching our village. During this time, attacks from wa-war planes, were intensifying, which were bombing German regiments and fl eeing Germans and has set Piaski aflame. At that time, retreating German er -- regiments and civilians, referred as to the Volksdeutsch, had penetrated into the village, took horses and anything else they could, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 86 and fled west. I and several other people from the village, took our horses from the stables and we ran off in the meadows to prevent the Germans army from requisi -- requisitioning our horses. We spent the night in the fields, in the bushes, where we safely waited until the morning. The German army horse corp, and along with them civilians, arrived in our yard that same night. Many farmers ran off into their meadows, whereas my parents and our neighbor, Adam Smoleara re mained in the building. In the morning my mother came and told us not to return home yet. We returned to the village only in the afternoon, once the Germans left. As we later discovered, rebels from the Polish underground army ambushed them outside of Piaski. Most likely they were Germans and Ukrainians. A portion of them who survived , returned to Sialishky and ordered us to leave our buildings because the Soviet army was going to occupy them. My parents quickly loaded the wagon with foods and clothe s, and at that time, informed the military personnel that the messengers from the village went to the commander in Piaski to verify whether this order was reliable. They were surprised by this information and shortly afterwards, left the village. Our village is located between two main roads, which when leaving Piaski, one leads to Holm and the other one to Zamosc. The Polish and Soviet armies were advancing on the road to Holm from Piaski, where the German\u2122s army was retreating likewise it on the road from Piaski to Zamosc toward Lublin. Both sides were exchanging machine gun fire from both Jal a nd the highest point -- from both Jal and the highest point in Sialishky. The villages, Driz ishky, Drazitchae, Jelltov and Piaski, and the surrounding area were aflame, but our village was preserved. During this shoot out, we were sitting in a man -- manhole across from our residence, that was dug up by my father USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 87 and our neighbor Alexander Pasternak. In your hi -- In our hiding pl -- In your hiding place, there was another exit through the attic into Pasternak\u2122s shed, that led to the meadow. My father explained to me that in case of any danger, you could have run away by opening the door of -- to the unlocked shed . After the German army retreated beyond Lublin, I decided to turn to work in Piaski. That was at the end of July \u212244. The day you left our house, I was at work. In my father\u2122s opinion, the main roads [indecipherable] Piaski Lublin was the safest and directed toward the road, becaus e that was where the Polish and Soviet regiments were located. On the side road, Sialishky Pershki, there were many deserters dressed as civilians, of whom my father was suspicious, so he decided to lead you to the road beyond the yard, that led to the main road.\ufb02 That is not so in my memory, but it doesn\u2122t really matter. \ufb01You asked in your letter if anyone heard you coughing. That was our neighbor, Adam Smalleara, who walked by your hiding place to his farm buildings every day. He told hi s neighbor Constanti Pocharlie about the coughing in your -- in our buildings. He was my father\u2122s brother and frequently came to our home.

My father stayed with the si -- her sister, who lived in Volla Garjanitska village, and I stayed with my cousin in Lublin. In our absence, my father\u2122s brother, Constanti Pocharlie and his wife Elixa, who resided in Sialishky, and liv ed near us, took care of our farm. They informed us through acquaintanc es that it was possible to return to Sialishky. Was Kriska in Sialishky? She did not live there.
