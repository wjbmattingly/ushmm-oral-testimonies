I did a little bit of genealogical research. It showed that I had roughly 250 family members in the empire. And I am saying this because when the empire broke up after this first World War, my family sort of stayed to \u2014 stayed in the geographical locations they were, but all of a sudden they were citizens of three different countries, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria. And some of my relatives also lived in Transylvania, so they became Romanian. And this was the situation between the two wars. We were a fairly closely knit family. People were keeping in touch with each other. And I know, for example, of what my great-grandparents did. One was on my father\u2019s side, a physician. And the other one on my father\u2019s side was a merchant, an importer, who imported mostly fruits and spices. My grand \u2014 great-grandparents on my mother\u2019s side, one owned a lumberyard, and the second one was a lawyer. And so I have quite a bit of \u2014 of information about them. My grandparents of \u2014 my maternal grandfather was an engineer, a mechanical engineer. Worked as chief engineer of a \u2014 of a factory in Hungary, and my grandmother was a housewife.

He \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to start again, and the un \u2014 my uncle was fairly discouraging as far as the possibilities of employment, because on \u2014 he was telling my father that he would be sort of a tradesman, maybe a mechanic. Well, my father was an engineer and a businessman and he didn\u2019t want to step down the ladder, so we didn\u2019t do anything.

            "answer": "Okay, between the time he lost his job and being taken away, many Jews figured a way to go around the \u2014 the laws. According to the laws, which were designed to squeeze the Jews out of the economic life of Hungary, a Jew could not practice business. But what they did, what the Jews did is they hired a Christian person who would then take out the business license, and they would work under him. And in our building where we lived, there was a super by name of George Dudek(ph) who was a very kind man. He was a friend of my f-father\u2019s, and he volunteer \u2014 he \u2014 he essentially agreed with my father that he would take out the license, and of course my father paid him a stipend, and under this \u2014 with this arrangement, my father was able to \u2014 to do that \u2014 some business. Now, when I talk about business, it was not a f \u2014 it was not a formal store. What \u2014 what they have done, and this is a fairly Interview with George Pick \" November 13, 1997 interesting story, is they \u2014 they went to coffeehouses, and they met there Jews and non-Jews and they made business essentially on a handshake [indecipherable] and they sold them both things. My father, being an engineer was more familiar with engineering materials, so he \u2014 he sold scrap iron, scrap materials and bought \u2014 bought them as well. And he had some partners who were \u2014 and business partners who were both Christian and Jew, and that\u2019s how he essentially made a living. And bet \u2014 and after \u00b039, he has done that for \u2014 for quite awhile. As you see, he came back after the 1940 induction, and then he was inducted another time. But between 1939 and 1944, he was home most of the time, and when he was home, he was doing this, he was practicing business."

My grandparents had a little home \u2014 a little home, a little yard and a \u2014 a small bungalow, about 20 miles from Budapest, which we used, as well as some of my other relatives for summer \u2014 a summer cottage. And I remember in 1940 particularly in the summer of \u201940, we went there. My mother and I stayed there for maybe a month, and my father came out on the weekends and we had some \u2014 I had some next door neighbors, little mini- farms, and kids came over, peasant children, and the \u2014 we played. And there was absolutely no talk about whether you were Jewish or you were not, they were just Interview with George Pick \" November 13, 1997 friends.

I was \u20141f I wasn\u2019t home, I was there, and they sort of regarded me as \u2014 as a family member. When there was Christmas, they had a little gift for me under the Christmas tree.

They \u2014 they had a \u2014 a girl who was my age as well. And the three girls and myself, we were almost inseparable friends in the age four to seven or eight, even up to 10.

It\u2019s called the Jewish Boys\u2019 Orphanage, but it was not just an orphanage, it was an elementary school for other children. And it wasn\u2019t even for boys only, it was a coed school.

            "answer": "Well, there were several reasons for that. One of it is that school was considered very good, and at that point I think my parents became aware that I should be more aware of my \u2014 my Jewishness. And so they decided that this was a\u2014 a good school for me. And indeed it was. I had met children, both girls and boys, who were \u2014 essentially who became lifelong friends. In fact, I still have a number of them here in this country, whom I known since age six from first elementary school. And so it was a\u2014a-\u2014a great bond, as it turned out. We had a great teacher Arn(ph) Magda(ph) who was a\u2014 a young woman at the time. And I remember the school as a very friendly school, and as a very friendly place to \u2014 to go to. I also remember Interview with George Pick \" November 13, 1997 that my mother took me every ni \u2014 every day. The school was about a half an hour walking distance from where li \u2014 where we lived. And I always woke up late. Actually, my mother didn\u2019t have the heart to wake me up early enough, so that we ended up running all the time. And \u2014 and she \u2014 I remember very well that she always had my \u2014 hand my \u2014 held my hand, and we ran through this city park to get to the school.

I also wanted to mention that we found out late in 1942 that the German government asked the Hungarian government to implement the Final Solution in budap \u2014 in Hungary, and the Hungarian government refused at that point. And this, of course, Interview with George Pick oS November 13, 1997 was a\u2014 was a great relief for us, and we really believed that the Hungarian government is \u2014 is not going to let us go.

And it is interesting because my father and I and my mother listened to the BBC every day, and there was very \u2014 there was a lot of news about the war, how the war went, and I remember very well that we had a big map at home, and my father had pins, red pins and white pins and we always looked at the \u2014 th-the map, and they were telling us where the \u2014 the offensives were, or what kind of battles, and my father was a\u2014 a vivid follower of all this. And there was a Hungarian speaking colonel on BBC, who spoke not very good Hungarian, very accented Hungarian, but he was the \u2014 the war correspondent, and he was the one who talked about all this, and we were very \u2014 very much listening to what was happening. There was no word, to my knowledge, which said anything about camps, or labor camps or deportation, or what happened to the Jews. Was very little, or nothing, nothing to my recollection. And in 1943 when \u2014 when this [indecipherable] breakthrough occurred, was a great sadness in Hungary. And I think that even the Jews, of course, felt sad because they knew how many Jews were killed. And as I mentioned, my next door neighbor was a \u2014 was an army officer, and my father and they \u2014 and he very often spoke about the \u2014 how the war was going. Now Hungary, of course, was a Nazi Interview with George Pick a November 13, 1997 ally, and I \u2014 today I \u2014 I \u2014 to-today I\u2014 I\u2014I wonder, you know, this man, he really had a great amount of goodwill, because he could denounce my father. I mean, my father was trying to convince him that the Germans lost the war in 1943, and in the beginning of \u00b044. And this man, of course he di \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he talked to my father, but I mean, this was a very dangerous thing my father was doing, and this man was really decent enough not to \u2014 not to do anything. On the other hand, I remember another man who lived in our building, who was a commander of a Jewish brigade, who took this Jewish brigade to the Ukraine. And when he came home on furlough, he was very proud of the fact that among his Jewish slave laborers, there were a number of extremely Orthodox Hassidim whose beard he personally cut and shaved and taught them the delights of eating pork.

It was a wide street, and it was very much \u2014 it had streetcars, Interview with George Pick \u201d November 13, 1997 but it ha \u2014 it had enough room for tanks. I remember also 12 years later in 1956, when the Russian tanks rumbled on the same street, toward the center of the city. But on that 19\" of March, it was absolutely frightening because we did not know what was going to happen. We knew that something terrible had happened. We heard the radio, and it was, you know, every hour on the hour there were more things, saying, you know, orders given to various units. Hungarian units do this, you know, fari \u2014 code words or code numbers, you know, 12th Hungarian division, be alert, or bring \u2014 bring yourselves to whatever city, and so forth. And what I remember is the confusion, and the \u2014 the disbelief that this could happen to us, and the \u2014 an-and the belief that \u2014 that now, something which we didn\u2019t think would happen, will. And of course, the optimist would say well, you know, what can the Germans do\u2019? The Germans came in because \u2014 we know why they came in, because the Russians are pushing the German army toward the west and the Germans want to make sure that the \u2014 the German army has a retreat, you know, it wants to make sure that \u2014 that \u2014 that it could retreat. We also knew somewhat earlier that the Hungarian government was already discussing peace feelers with \u2014 with the Brits, and that that government was quite liberal and looked the other way. Well, that all changed on that day. In three days a new government was sworn in, Dome Sztojay, who was a-\u2014 p-prior to this was the \u2014 the ambassador of Hungary to Berlin. And he Interview with George Pick * November 13, 1997 was essentially a \u2014 an \u2014 he \u2014 he didn\u2019t speak very good Hungarian, he was a German himself. There were these Germans in the west side of Hungary, groups of Germans living there, we called them Schwabs. They were the \u2014 th-the ethnic Germans, and Szt\u00e9jay was one of them. And his government was containing the extreme Nazi elements. The only thing which was relatively heartening to us is that the \u2014 that Horthy, who was the head of the government, stayed. Now, we found out that Horthy was out of the country, and \u2014 but he came back later that afternoon. He was with Hitler, and of course that was the trick Hitler used; while Horthy was out, that\u2019s when the \u2014 they came. We also found out that a couple of days later, that Eichmann and company also showed up in Budapest. The reason why I know this is that my mother had an uncle who was a very prominent lawyer, and who was still practicing law in 1943. And the reason why he was \u2014 were two reasons. One is that he was a World War I hero, a very decorated captain of the Austro-Hungarian army, and he was exempt from Jewish law. And secondly, he was a good friend of the German ambassador, Jakov. Well, Jakov left, Veesenmeyer came in. And va \u2014 before Jakov left, he told my Grand-uncle Paul, Paul Kornhauser, whose son was lost in Voronezh, that Paul, things are changing. But Paul was a Germanophile all his life, a-an admirer of Germany. Never really believed that anything could happen to him. He was a prominent Jew. He was not very religious, but he was very Interview with George Pick * November 13, 1997 active in the Jewish community. Many of the Jewish leaders told him that he\u2019s on a list, that he should go into hiding. Well, he didn\u2019t.

Well, they didn\u2019t exempt him at all. In fact, they \u2014 they captured him and in a week, he and a hundred prominent Jewish leaders were sent to Auschwitz and he died there.

So by the fifth of April we all wore the yellow stars. That was sort of my 10\" birthday present."

It was the first raid on Budapest, bombing \u2014 bombing raid. And my grandfather, as I mentioned, on my father\u2019s side, who lived with my aunt, whose husband was also inducted into the Ukraine, they lived in a small house, not too far from where we lived.

And I don\u2019t know how and why so naively my father and mother went over to him, and asked him to help, give first aid help to my \u2014 to my aunt. So, rather naively my father went down to ask this SS doctor to help my aunt. I was there with him, and \u2014 with my aunt. And this man \u2014 I never forget his expression, he had very light blue eyes, and the amount of hatred which \u2014 which came out, was incredible and indescribable. What he said, I\u2019d never forget, he says, you dirty Jews, you think I will help you? He says, you will \u2014 you will die just your brothers and sisters did, very soon.

He was one of the Nazi doctors who did experiments apparently, in the camps. I don\u2019t Interview with George Pick 7 November 13, 1997 know what happened to him after the war.

But \u2014 but the \u2014 the sisters were kind, and it was \u2014 if it were something which would really help, I would say why \u2014 why not to do it? I mean, a lot of people did it. It turned out that \u2014 that conversions did not help at all. My \u2014 my uncle, who was converted because he believed in Catholicism, by the Primate of Hungary in the early 30s, and who went to church every Sunday, was inducted as a Jew, because both his parents were Jewish and he was Jewish and his conversion was too late, and the only difference between him and my father was that he wore a white armband while my father wore a yellow armband. And \u2014 but he got the same treatment, in fact worse, and he ended up in Auschwitz and he was gassed. So we knew that \u2014 that conversions were, at that point, ineffective, but when in \u2014 when you are in a situation like this, you try anything and everything you can. But it always struck me and it always stayed with Interview with George Pick \u201d November 13, 1997 me, that despite of the fact that my father was \u2014 I don\u2019t think he had gone into a synagogue a half a dozen times in his last 20 years of his life, he still would refuse to do this, and that he was very much of a \u2014 a-\u2014a Jew. But he allowed us to, if he wanted to, they gave us this \u2014 this \u2014 this choice. So, what happened to us then, May came, and we got the \u2014 the order that we have to move.

There was one apartment which was occupied by a Christian family. The man was the super of the apartment, his name was Mr. Vargo(ph), Janus(ph) Vargo(ph). He was a decent fellow, and as you will hear, the \u2014 his actions were quite crucial in saving our lives; both my grandmothers and the relatives there, and my mother\u2019s and mine. We settled in, essentially in the last week of June. There were a few young people, I Interview with George Pick * November 13, 1997 was the youngest kid, there were no kids. There were a few teenagers, mostly older people. And almost daily, toward the end of June, we started to have to go down to the air raid shelter, because of air raids. I remember one particular day very vividly, and that was July the second, 1944; it was a Sunday. And even before, I was always worried about air raids, because evas \u2014 ever since the April air raid, ever since my aunt was hurt, I was afraid. And I remember once Mr. Vargo(ph) [indecipherable] was on the second of July, he \u2014 after everybody was ordered to the air raid shelter, he took me upstairs to the \u2014 just to the street level, to show me how beautiful those airplanes are. And they were, I mean, indeed, huge airplanes coming in, hundreds of them. And I \u2014 I can never forget the \u2014 the tremendous number. I mean, they almost covered the sky. And we were out there maybe one or two minutes, and then I said no, I don\u2019t want to stay there, I want to go downstairs. So we did. And we sat there very quietly for about 10 minutes and then all of a sudden we heard this tremendous crash. At first is a whistling sound, a crash and the whole building shook up. And I started to scream and everybody else did too, and my mother sort of put my \u2014 my head against her \u2014 her bosom and trying to put her hands again \u2014 in my \u2014 on my ears so that I wouldn\u2019t hear this. And a few minutes later another, even larger sound, and it was like an earthquake. And we saw \u2014 we had these blast do \u2014 doors leading to the outside, and \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 this \u2014 this is a very heavy steel door. And Interview with George Pick \u201c November 13, 1997 along the door you see this brilliant light coming in. Of course, by then the electricity was gone, and we were sitting in the pitch dark. And \u2014 and this \u2014 this was like \u2014 like hell. And it went on for three hours, and we had four more very close hits, and we didn\u2019t think that we were going to survive, and then we did. And after three hours we came up, and what we saw was incredible. We had \u2014 this building was a three story apartment building. It was sort of stood by itself. About a hundred yards behind it, there was a six story apartment building, which was hit. And the only thing \u2014 and it was a Jewish house, with the same yellow star like we did. The only thing which stayed up there was one fire wall, and everything was down on \u2014 in a big heap, and people were dead. Across the street there was a villa, a private home, before the raid. Afterwards, there was just a huge crater in the \u2014 crater in the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the earth, and you could see body parts. You could see hands and legs and [indecipherable]. And this \u2014 the right side had four tennis courts, nothing but a big crater. And the left side was a \u2014 just a vacant lot, and a crater. So essentially, within a hundred yards of the building, we had four huge bombs hit. And I could almost feel even today this \u2014 this smell of \u2014 of \u2014 of death there and \u2014 and \u2014 and everything was smoking, and it was blackened, and purple, the sky was purple. And some people were optimists. I \u2014 I just can\u2019t believe that people said well, maybe this is the end. Maybe \u2014 maybe this was used as a \u2014 as a camouflage to Interview with George Pick \u201c November 13, 1997 \u2014 to drop paratroopers here, and maybe the Brits and the Americans are here, and we will be coming \u2014 we\u2019ll be freed.

We did not know this, but what had happened is the extreme Nazis wanted to commit a coup, and get rid of Interview with George Pick \"\u00b0 November 13, 1997 Horthy. And they got these 3,000 gendarmes for two reasons; one is to prepare for deportation of the Jews, and number two is to get rid of Horthy. And there was only just a few, the courage of a few army officers who were available and who were ready to follow orders. And one single army unit, a Panzer division was willing to come to Budapest to counteract this \u2014 not necessarily the deportation of the Jews, but the \u2014 the coup against the region. And by the second of July, they were around Budapest, taking up positions. By the seventh of July, they forced these gendarmes to leave. And Horthy declared that that day, that they deportations would stop. And that, of course, saved our lives, because with 3,000 gendarmes, we would be deported in probably a week, or two weeks. I mean, in six weeks, almost 500,000 Hungarian Jews were deported from the countryside. You can imagine that 160 to 180,000 Jews in \u2014 in Budapest, were concentrated, could be deported in a matter of days. But we were not. And that saved our lives. What happened after this was a\u2014a little miracle. Eichmann left. He was frustrated by this inaction by the Hungarian government. And he also knew that things were not going well in the front. What we didn\u2019t know, but he did, and many of the Nazis did, 1s that the Hungarian government started again some negotiations with the western allies and even with the Russians. And these negotiations, essentially, they wanted to manifest this \u2014 their good will. So the way they did it 1s they essentially replaced the Interview with George Pick 7 November 13, 1997 government with a \u2014 a government of army officers, who were not as extreme. And"

And Horthy used to ride the horse, also. And I remember this procession in the late 30s, when this had happened. And I saw him once after that. In 1938, if I remember, there was a huge, Catholic congress in Budapest, where the pope came, and \u2014 or at least the man who became pope later, Interview with George Pick . November 13, 1997 Pius the 12\". And he spoke and Horthy was with him and I saw \u2014 I remember that I saw \u2014 this was a huge thing.

            "answer": "Well, I was a lonely child, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t have people to play with, so I played with my toys, and I was with the relatives. They played cards, and I sort of sat next to my mother, and they had a\u2014 a game which they played every \u2014 a day, which was a sort of a superstition. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this game exists here, I guess it does. There is a [indecipherable] like a \u2014 a [indecipherable] with alphabets, with \u2014 with various ABC and so forth. And what they do is they put a \u2014 an upside-down \u2014 a turned water glass, and they put their hands on and then supposedly a ghost comes and then pushes the glass and then spells out things and tells you your answers, you know, and most of the questions were, are we going to have an air raid tonight, you know, and of course we didn\u2019t need to know the answer, we knew that it was coming. But, you know, some people believed this, and we played that every day. That was a\u2014a-\u2014a game we played. And we also, as I said, we played various \u2014 various games, word games, and I was sort of tolerated by the adults. And I was trying to be a fly on the wall most of the time, and didn\u2019t do too much. Wasn\u2019t very happy and wasn\u2019t very active. I was reading a lot actually, I had a few books and I was reading. I \u2014 I was \u2014 my favorite author was Jules Verne, and since I was all [indecipherable] up, I was reading about \u201c20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,\u201d and Five Weeks in the A-Air \u2014 Air Balloon, and things like that. I \u2014 I was always interested in \u2014 in adventures, and it was certainly an ironic time to read about those Interview with George Pick * November 13, 1997 adventures. And that\u2019s what I did. And the summer went relatively fast, and \u2014 and it was lucky, because my father\u2019s unit was brought back from the western parts of Hungary, where they built fortifications to Budapest. And my father was lucky because his commander was a decent man again. Turned out that his \u2014 the commander\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was Jewish, and she lived in our building. And the commander sort of looked the other way when half of his brigade sort of disappeared every evening, and reappeared every early morning. This was strictly illegal. If a man was caught, he \u2014 under the circumstances, he would be subject to immediate execution. Nevertheless, my father, about two, three times a week, took this chance and came home late at night, after curfew, and Mr. Vargo(ph) let him in. Mr. Vargo(ph) got a few hundred peng\u00e9s for this act, but nevertheless, he took a chance too. My father came in for a few hours, and then he went back early in the morning. So it was happiness that we have seen him at that time. And again, the eternal optimist said well, 1t couldn\u2019t last long. The Russians were already fighting. We knew the Romanians were out of the war already, and \u2014 and they know \u2014 we also knew that, you know, the war couldn\u2019t last for more than a week or two. I mean, the Russians were less than a hundred kilometers from Budapest at this point. So the October 15 rolled around, and October 15 was a very tumultuous and very important day. That was the day when Horthy declared that Hungary was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick * November 13, 1997 becoming a neutral country, and that Hungary essentially threw in the towel. Well, I can tell you that 1t was unreal for us. We heard this on loudspeakers, and we went out, and we ra \u2014 ripped al \u2014 our yellow stars off, and we were absolutely hysterical. But the people around us were yelling down from their windows that we are just a little bit too premature, we are a little bit too happy. And they said, well, you dirty Jews, don\u2019t think that you will survive. And indeed, they were more prophetic that we realized, because in a couple of hours, the \u2014 this \u2014 this coup was over. In fact, with German help, the most extreme Nazis, Hungarian Nazis took over. The ar \u2014 the Arrow Cross. And we heard Mr. Vargo\u2019s(ph) radio, he was nice enough to open his doors so people could hear through the radio, when they were looking for Barakti(ph) Burger(ph), who was the extreme Nazi general to come to Budapest immediately to assume the \u2014 the \u2014 the command of the \u2014 the troops. And we heard by the end of the day that Horthy was arrested and then that Szalasi became the head of the state and a new government was sworn in. And this was the 15\". Ten days later, all the women between the ages of \u2014 Jewish women, ages of 18 and 40 were ordered to come to a soccer field, which was the Kishauk(ph) soccer field. And this impacted my aunts, Elizabeth, who was 29, with a baby of three years old, and Yoli(ph), who was 38, with a cousin of mine, who was my age, 11 \u2014 10 \u2014 10 and a half. And my mother was 43, so she was too old to go, but they did. And Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick ** November 13, 1997 10,000 young women went. The women who had children were excused, and Yoli(ph) left, but Elizabeth didn\u2019t. She was too tired, she was just \u2014 she said, I \u2014 I \u2014 I just give up. And the \u2014 she was one of the ones who were deported. At that time they had no transportation except to walk. They had these death marches. And she made the death march, we knew that she did, because her friends who survived told us. She got to Ravensbrick, and she died a few days before liberation. She was 29. Her baby daughter, Susan, was hidden by an aunt who was not Jewish, who was a wife of my uncle, Lazlo Pick. Now Lazlo Pick was one of the uncles who went to the Ukraine in 1941. He was a thin, skinny man, but he was a tenacious sports person. And he walked the 800 miles. He just got back in March of 1944, just in time for the next round. And he was to be deported in September, but he didn\u2019t wait for that, he took his rucksack, left it and went home, where his wife, in an efficiency apartment not very much bigger than this one, hid him in a closet for three months. And she also hid the baby, my cousin Susan, and they survived. My father came home in the beginning of November, with the news that he got the 24 hours furlough, and that he is going \u2014 he wa \u2014 if he 1s going back next mon \u2014 next day in the morning, he 1s to go to the railroad station, and he knows that he was going to be taken to Germany, and he was not about to go back. He had a friend, and they had a plan. The plan was that they were going to my grandfather\u2019s abandoned building, Interview with George Pick ~ November 13, 1997 which was in ruins, but the basement was in fairly good shape. And they knew the war was going to be over in a week, so they would go there and they would just stick it out there. And my father left, and we didn\u2019t know what happened. This was the sixth of November. We didn\u2019t know anything. On the 22\"4 of November, a \u2014 an army man came over and we were very surprised, I mean, you don\u2019t see an army soldier coming to a Jewish house. And he came in and he wanted to talk to my mother and he handed her a note. And the note said that \u2014 was a one sentence that said, you and George follow this soldier and come immediately where he will take you. Well, my mother was unhappy about this, because she didn\u2019t want to leave my grandmother and everybody. And \u2014 and \u2014 or the \u2014 the message was not to tell anybody anything. And so we went, but my mother didn\u2019t take anything except me with her. And we went to this place, which was a factory building on the other side of town, in a blue collar neighborhood, called Chango(ph) Street. And it was a factory, a textile factory. And the soldier took us there and we met my father. It turned out that this factory was a camouflage place, where they had a bunch of Jews, Jewish men, hidden. The outs \u2014 for the outside world this factory was a factory for army uniforms, Hungarian army uniforms. My father was quite mad at us when he saw that we just came with nothing, and told us to go back immediately, and come the very same evening, come hell or high water. So my mother saw when Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick ~ November 13, 1997 \u2014 when \u2014 when she saw \u2014 when she saw that he was mad, we went home. We got back and we were terribly rushed, because we had maybe a half an hour before curfew. And she threw in a couple of \u2014 she \u2014 the thing which she was most worried about were the family photos. And she threw in a f\u2014 the family photos in a small bag, which I still have. And she also put a little food in, and nothing else. While we were in the midst of this desperate packing, the house was raided by two teenage Nazis. And they came in, one must not been \u2014 I don\u2019t think one was more than 13 and the other one maybe 16 - 17. They had submachine guns with them. And they went and they rampaged the whole place. They \u2014 they broke things, they stole things, they made a mess. They saw these little thing which my mother put together, this little bag, and threw it on the floor and stomped on it, and they terrorized everybody for a couple of hours. And then they finally left. And this was after the curfew. So my mother put everything back and begged Mr. Vargo(ph) to let us out. Again, little money changed hands and Vargo(ph) let us out and we went. And we got there \u2014 this was end of November, toward the end of November, so it was a short day, just like today. And by six o\u2019clock or so, it was quite late la \u2014 quite dark. We got there and my father was really relieved to see us, and told us how he got there, because we didn\u2019t know what was going on. So he told us that he went to this rendezvous place with his friend, his name was Gargutzi(ph). And Gargutzi(ph) Interview with George Pick * November 13, 1997 never showed up. He was caught in a raid, and he was killed. So my father was in a panic, and went to a friend of his, by the name of Gaykis(ph), who was a Christian business associate, and told him that he needs to hide somewhere. Well Gaykis(ph) told him that he would be happy to help. He gave him this address, it\u2019s Changutca(ph) 6B address, and gave him a note. Told him to \u2014 not to talk to anybody, just go there, hand the note to the commanding officer of this army \u2014 factory. My father did just that, and he handed the note to the soldier and \u2014 and the soldier took back the note to the army commander and then the door opened and he was let in, and the army commander went to see him. The army commander turned out to be a Jew who was a friend of my father\u2019s, and who was playing this role. He was a spit and polished army \u2014 army commander uniform. And he told my father that 65 people who escaped from deportation are also there. They are all men, and he is welcome. And this was in the beginning of November. Toward the middle of November, the man who heard the news \u2014 they were much better informed, of course, than us, that things are happening throughout town, they knew about the deportation of the women. They started to bring their families in. So my father also took this \u2014 sent a soldier who was a deserter \u2014 a real, bona fide soldier, but a deserter, to the note \u2014 with the note to my mother, and that\u2019s how we got there. Well, my mother didn\u2019t bring anything and so my father\u2019s overcoat served for the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick *\u00b0 November 13, 1997 next three months as our blanket. We did not know what had happened, but this is what happened, the very next day: the Arrow Cross raiders came back, and took everybody from the building where we lived, to the brickyards. And at that point, Mr. Vargo(ph), who knew of a brother, my grandmothers had a \u2014 two sisters and a brother in Budapest. And a brother lived in a Swedish house, Swedish \u2014"

This we found out later, after the war. In the place where we now were in the factory, we had about 120 - 130 people. They had a bunch of kids, young women and 1n a few days we found out that there was a group of young people who were running around in Nazi uniforms, but they were Jews. And they had a \u2014 a group of five or six people who went to the deportation trains and to the roads, to snatch some people back. They had papers, wi Interview with George Pick \u201d November 13, 1997 \u2014 which were forgeries, which said that such and such people would have to be brought back to headquarters because they wanted to interrogate them.

I mean, since \u2014 since the early spring that year, in 1944, I haven\u2019t been with kids.

And that was another friendship, but she was more interested in another fellow, who was a young man by the name of Bondi(ph). And Bondi(ph) was one of the \u2014 the refugees there, the \u2014 the one who was able to escape from deportation. Interview with George Pick .\" November 13, 1997 And Bondi(ph) one day, and this was the very end of November, I think the 30\", got very, very sick. And he got high fever and he was delirious. And the committee who ran this place had a real dilemma, they didn\u2019t know what to do. If they bring in somebody from the outside, you know, they may jeopardize 129 \u2014 69 people, and if they don\u2019t, they may have Bondi(ph) dead within a day or two. Well, they decided the next day, when Bondi\u2019s(ph) condition became worse, that they were going to bring somebody in. And \u2014 and they brought a Christian doctor in late at night, and he gave him sulfur drugs, it turned out that it was an infection. And in a day or so, he got better. The date is very important, this was the first of December. In the morning of the second, we heard the running steps, and as we were trying to scramble for some shelter, we saw five men running in with submachine guns and yelling and screaming us and saying that we know who you are, you are just a bunch of dirty Jews who are trying to \u2014 to hide here, and we are the police, the Nazi state police. This was the gest \u2014 the Hungarian Gestapo. And they sorted out the men to one side of the room, and women and children to the other and we thought that this was the end. I mean, there was just no way. Within the few seconds of confusion, one man, John dove out the window and into another building. It was like six or seven feet, and he really jumped, and he crashed through a \u2014 a \u2014 a glass door \u2014 glass enclosure. And his luck was that it was a haystack underneath, so he Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick \" November 13, 1997 got into the haystack. And they ran after him, they tried to push the haystack, they couldn\u2019t find him. But we were captured, and we thought that this was going to be the end. But for a while nothing happened, and about 20 or 30 minutes later, the detectives, one of the leaders of the detectives came out of the office, and made the following startling statement, that henceforth we are under their protection. And we just couldn\u2019t figure out what happened. There was only one arrest which they made, and that was a na\u2014 aman by the name of Kormus(ph). Kormus(ph) was the \u2014 the leader of the group. Not the commander, but the real leader, the organizer. I didn\u2019t know much about Kormus(ph), but I found out later what \u2014 who he was. They took him and they took us, oh, 10,000 dollars in cash, which by sheer luck was there, because there were a number of extremely rich people in hiding. So in other words, they bribed these detectives. And they left with Kormus(ph) and the money, but they left us behind. After the war I found out that they took Kormus(ph) and they \u2014 they tortured him for two days because they knew that this, our place, was not the only one. In fact, it was a network of four places, all of which Kormus(ph) ran. They knew of three, our place, and another two. And what happened is Kormus(ph) was betrayed. We thought that the doctor did \u2014 betrayed us, it was not the doctor. It was aman by name of Althurdi(ph), who hid Kormus(ph) and his family for months. And the speculation was that he was either blackmailed, or he didn\u2019t get Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick \u00b0* November 13, 1997 enough money, but he betrayed Kormus(ph). He knew of three places Kormus(ph) could have been, and he knew of a fourth place, but he did not know the address of the fourth place. So when he \u2014 when Kormus(ph) was betrayed, they raided three of the four places, Kormus(ph) happened to be in our place. But the fourth place they didn\u2019t know. The fourth place was a factory in another part of Budapest with 350 Jewish slave laborers who were essentially also hiding there. But they, the slave laborers were armed, and they had a mission there. They were armed, and their mission was that they would save the utility companies of Budapest. The paper said \u2014 they were all in army uniforms \u2014 their paper said that they would be the last one to stay, to blow up these utilities, the gas \u2014 gas company, the \u2014 the wa \u2014 the waterworks and so forth, and the electric company. That was the paper which said, but the real mission was to, in fact, save these utilities. And every day they were trained like soldiers. Every night on the other hand, they we \u2014 they had a little factory underneath and they forged papers. And they worked with the Zionists and they worked with our little group, and they were part of the Hungarian Jewish resistance, and Kormus(ph) was the head. So Kormus(ph) \u2014 they \u2014 they knew Kormus(ph) knew about this and they tortured him. He did not speak, and because he didn\u2019t show up for two days, they knew in the fourth place, that things were bad, so they left. They \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t accomplish their mission, but they Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick \u201c November 13, 1997 were all safe, they were able to escape. And then Kormus(ph) was sentenced to death, and they took him to the Danube, but he was able to escape. He was very sick because of the fact that he \u2014 they tortured him, but he escaped. He was able to hide, and he survived the war. The other two places which were raided, were not as lucky as we were. They had not many rich people there and they were deported. One was deported on foot to \u2014 to Germany, and they all died. And the second part was taken to political headquarters, and they \u2014 they were among the ones who were sentenced and 70 of them were taken to the Danube, and only Kormus(ph) was able to escape. The rest of them were shot into the Danube. So our group was essentially the \u2014 out of the three groups, our group was the only one who survived. After this happened, the committee who ran the building decided that the 22 children were not safe, so they decided to take us from \u2014 ranging from age of six months to 11 years, I was among the oldest. And one lady who \u2014 who had the six months old son, I think, they took us to a\u2014 a Red Cross building which was in the middle of the city. We took the lorry and the soldier brought us to the Red Cross building. And the idea was that this was a protected building, we would be fed there and we would be okay. That was the theory. The practice was that when we got there, there were about three or 400 children, crying, hungry, dirty and maybe a half a dozen adults. I didn\u2019t like the place at all.

            "answer": "By the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross building, okay? They were the \u2014 they had about 30 buildings throughout town, which were run by the Swiss Red Cross, like the Swedish buildings, this \u2014 but this was not within that enclosure, you know. There was a\u2014 what they called an international ghetto, where the Swiss, the Swedes, the [indecipherable] and the Spanish had rented buildings, about 32 buildings. This was 1n a part of town, and they were all concentrated. That\u2019s where my grandmother and my grand-aunts and uncle were. The Red Cross buildings were throughout the city, they were essentially Swiss protected. Not very well, as you will hear in a minute. But at the time that I got there they were protected, and they were concentrating children there. Now, the idea was that there were adults who would supervise these children, they would bring hoo \u2014 food and everything. Well, the \u2014 that was the theory. The practice was that the building was almost empty. I was put in with a friend of mine, into a room where we had about 35 children of my age. No furniture, we were sleeping on the floor and we were told that there is no food for the day. Well, I wandered around and I was crying, and I met a friend of mine from school there, who was there with his sister. I knew him, his name is Mike Vairmas(ph). He now lives here in this country. And he was telling me that he wa \u2014 he just came in a few days earlier and they are thinking about leaving the Interview with George Pick \u00b0\u00b0 November 13, 1997 building, escaping, because they haven\u2019t gotten any food there since they came. So, a young girl saw me there crying, and asked me why I was crying, and I was saying I was hungry and I was lonely for my mother. This young girl has a boyfre \u2014 had a boyfriend who was in a Nazi uniform, and who told me that he would be more than happy to take me back. Well, I knew that that was not the right answer, and I knew that I had to escape now, cause I knew that if this man would take a \u2014 take me back to where we are hiding, you know, he would betray us. So John Foti(ph) and I decided that in the very next morning, we are going to take off. And the building was locked from the inside, so we couldn\u2019t just walk out. And the next morning when the employees came, there was a kindly lady who came and we asked her to take us out so that we could buy some food. And as she took us out, we ran away from her."

            "answer": "It was a brave decision, but it \u2014 we had no choice, because if we went back, the Nazi would recognize us, would take us to where my father and mother and the other people were hiding. I didn\u2019t want to take that chance. The chance was that they would catch us somewhere, because they were looking for kids too, and of course we didn\u2019t wear our \u2014 our yellow star. That was the chance I had to take. It took us a couple of hours to \u2014 to get back. We were sort of ducking various little Interview with George Pick \"\u00b0 November 13, 1997 groups of Nazis who were patrolling the streets. We bought a newspaper, which we pretended to read. We took a number of streetcars to go, and we knew where \u2014 where the place was, so we had to change like three times, and we got back there. My mother couldn\u2019t believe that I did come back and we came back. We were the only two kids who \u2014 who did come back. After the war I found out that about three days later, the Nazis raided the building and they took the children to the Danube and they shot them. And my friend Mike and his sister escaped just a day or so earlier, but not the rest of them; the rest of them all died. So here we were, this was, I think maybe the 10\" of December. A few days after this, two policemen showed up in our building and told us that the detectives sent out \u2014 sent them to let us know that we are under suspicion by some of the Nazis, who live in the area, and they are about to report this suspicious building and people. And that they da \u2014 they suggested that we should follow them, they would take us to the ghetto. The ghetto in Budapest was established at the very end of November. And the people who were still in the \u2014 the yellow stone \u2014 yellow starred houses were taken to the \u2014 to the places. Now, many of the yellow starred houses were raided, and many of the people already were deported, but in the middle of December, which is what \u2014 what was, there were \u2014 Budapest was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops. And so the Nazis decided that they would concentrate the Jews who are left in Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick \"\" November 13, 1997 Budapest into a small ghetto in the middle of town, which was the \u2014 used to be the Jewish quarters. And then they would do something. And so, on the 14\" of December, the ghetto was already established and these policemen told us that they would go ahead, we would be behind them, they would not look back, and nothing else was said. Well, of the 150 people roughly, only 65 arrived in the ghetto. The rest sort of evaporated along the way. My father decided that we have nowhere to hide, so we went back to the ghetto. The ghetto, as I mentioned, was in a very poor section of town, the Jewish quarters. The center of it was a square, Klauzal square, and in that square, or one part of the square was a market. They took us to the market, where the Nazis \u2014 a number of Nazis were there, Hungarian Nazis, told us that, if you have any jewelry, money, they are going to do a body search, and if they find anything, they\u2019Il shoot us. There was a dead body to sh \u2014 to prove the point. And we didn\u2019t have anything, but a couple of people did, and they would throw the \u2014 the jewelry into the sewer rather than giving it to these people. Of the 63 of us who got there, we were separated into several groups. The group which my father and I \u2014 my mother and I stayed with were about 20 people. We were just taken to the other side of the square, is Klauzal square seven, a three story old building. Turned out that this building housed a \u2014 the remnants of a old age home, old age Jewish home, brought in, and the first two stories \u2014 floors, were quite chock full of Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick \u00b0\u00b0 November 13, 1997 people, but the third story was empty. So they gave us two rooms there, and it was dirty and no food. And I remember that after \u2014 the day after we arrived, my father, who was always enterprising, he was looking around and he found a piece of bread, which must have been six months old. And bugs were jumping all over the place out of it, but he said, that\u2019s okay, because we\u2019ll toast it and then we can eat it. That\u2019s precisely what we did, somehow we toasted it, bugs all got fried and then we ate a piece of it. That was the food for that particular day. People were not very choosy at that point. My father also went around to see what \u2014 what was the situation in the ghetto. The ghetto was \u2014 th-the area originally was an area for about 12,000 people. By the time we got there, they had about 40,000 people living there, and at its peak they had 70,000 people. So you can imagine that there were not \u2014 there was not much room around."

Well, you don\u2019t fight off people with machine guns when they come in, and of course, they couldn\u2019t. Many of them died because of that.

They had a couple of workbenches there and I never moved out of that place after that happened. I never Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick m November 13, 1997 needed to move out because in about two days, the \u2014 which was Christmas day, the siege of Budapest began, and everybody moved on. The food supply was catastrophic. We had people who were old \u2014 and I mean old \u2014 battle hardened Hungarian Jewish slave laborers, the remnants of the people who were taken out in 1941. About a half a dozen of them ended up in our building. A number of them were very religious Jews, and they were Hassids and they were praying all day long. A number of them were not too religious, but none of them were willing to risk their lives at that point to bring food. There were food available about a block or a block and a half from where we lived, but somebody had to go there and get it. My father always volunteered, but he was not enough just by himself, and a few people went and some got hurt. And so our food supply, because of this, was very precarious. People knew that the war couldn\u2019t la \u2014 end up \u2014 I mean, how long could you live like this? There was no water, there was no electricity, gas, nothing.

There was one little girl in our building, her name was Alice. She was about eight years old, and she was a weak little kid. She was not very alive. She had a mother, and a grandmother. The mother was diabetic, and the grandmother was also. And she came sometimes to play with me, but I didn\u2019t like her that much. This day, on the 17\", she came not just to my mother, but Interview with George Pick \u00ae November 13, 1997 to everybody to beg for some food for her mother, who \u2014 who was in a diabetic shock. We had very little, namely and specifically, we had about a quarter of a pound of sugar. As I mentioned earlier, when we left our house, our home, the Jewish re \u2014 yellow star home to go into hiding, my mother took very little food with us. This food was shepherded along since November, now it\u2019s January. The la \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 a month of food which is left in that little bag 1s fa \u2014 is a half a pound of sugar. My mother kept it for me because she felt that maybe a few sugar cubes would save my life if \u2014 if it all comes down to that. So my mother refused to give Alice any food. This was the 17\". On the 18\" of January in the morning \u2014 on the evening of the 17, my father came home and he decided to stay home. On the 18\" there was a strange quiet. We didn\u2019t know what happened. It wasn\u2019t as quiet for \u2014 for weeks. I mean, this was a 24 hour a day artillery duel and bombing raid and we didn\u2019t know how much was left over of that city. And all of a sudden it was \u2014 was strange. So somebody climbed up to that slit window, about nine feet about the \u2014 the floor of the basement and saw some strange boots. They were not Nazi boots, they were Russian boots, and we were liberated. There was no elation. We vid \u2014 we really even didn\u2019t say anything to each other. It was fear that the Nazis would come back. Was indecision what to do next. The one thing we found out is that Alice\u2019s mother and grandmother were both dead, and my mother felt terribly guilty for the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick \u201d November 13, 1997 next 47 years of her life. Nobody could tell her that she was saving the food to her son, that was a choice between somebody whom she didn\u2019t know, and her own son, and there was really no choice in the matter. She felt still guilty til the day \u2014 day of her death. I remember that some of the younger people evaporated first. They didn\u2019t ask, they didn\u2019t say anything. We didn\u2019t know what happened to the people whom we knew. My father and mother decided that, around noontime, that it\u2019s time for us to leave. Both my mother and father were so weak that the little suitcase which we had, which contained a half a pound of sugar and the family\u2019s pictures, they couldn\u2019t carry. I was the one who carried them, I was the \u2014 the strongest one. My father, who was 43 years old, looked like 70. And in his two or three weeks of patrol, he lost three of his partners, and he was more dead than alive. And then he \u2014 we Started to walk out of the ghetto, that was not \u2014 not an easy walk. There were very few walkways there, half of the buildings were on the street. We heard the shrapnel zipping and making this awful noise above our heads. The artillery fire was going on, the \u2014 the siege of Budapest was still going on. It took us three hours to get home, and we decided, like homing pigeons, to go back to our home from which we were thrown out by the Nazis in June of 1944. We went back, it took us three hours, two and a half miles. We saw, in that journey, many dead bodies, many dead horses, and one live Russian. Which was almost ludicrous because this man Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick i November 13, 1997 was singing. He was singing, he wa \u2014 must have been drunk, but he \u2014 he had a happy face, he was smiling and singing. And we looked at him as if he were crazy, instead of the world. Maybe he was the ones \u2014 the only sane people in that \u2014 person in that whole \u2014 whole mad, maddening scene. And as we were walking, these shrapnels were hitting buildings, and whole walls came down, tumbling in front of us. I mean, we were in mortal danger, we \u2014 we were crazy to walk there, but we did. And we walked through the city park, and we were held up by a small group of Russians, who wanted us to, for all other things, break up the ice on the sidewalk. I mean, breaking up the ice, and he gave us these ice picks to do it. My father couldn\u2019t lift it, you know, and he finally said well, forget it, and they gave us a loaf of bread. That was the first loaf of bread we have seen for more than a month. It was \u2014 was a square loaf of bread, I remember. And they just let us go. And we stumbled home, and it was maybe four, five in the afternoon by the time we got there. And the man whom we met first was Mr. Dudek(ph). Mr. Dudek(ph) was the man who was giving my father the paper under which he was able to work for years, and who also hid a large suitcase full of food, which we left with him in June, and which he gave back to us. I remember the suitcase was a green suitcase, 1t was a canvas, but it was full of canned food. He didn\u2019t take any. But the rest of the people who lived there were rather frightened. They looked at us as if we were ghosts. Not Interview with George Pick \" November 13, 1997 just because of our physical appearance, but because of their bad conscious. Here these Jews came back. Now what will happen? There were \u2014 we knew about those extreme Nazis, Mr. Drexler(ph), who was \u2014 who was boasting about his adventures with the Hassidic Jews whose \u2014 whose beard he cut off and whose stomach he filled with \u2014 with pork. And some others, who were no less guilty. They thought they will \u2014 that we were going to denounce them to the Russians. We were too tired, too sick to \u2014 too nothing to \u2014 to do anything. The miracle which happened to us was that a few hours later my \u2014 my maternal grandmother came home. Turned out that she was in the ghetto. And revenge was the furthest from our minds. My grandmother was born in what is now Slovakia, so she spoke the language. Russian troops came down, everybody was frightened of them. We found out that they came a few days earlier, raped a few women. But my grandmother spoke their language and they were very, very friendly. And I remember that Mr. Dudek(ph) made room for us, and on the evening of the 18\" of January, we s \u2014 we went to sleep in another basement, in another part of town, and the siege of Budapest was still on. In fact, it was still on for more than a month, because Buda was still defended by the Nazis for a month after Pest was liberated. The life came back slowly. The first thing we tried to do is to get some food somewhere. My father found a rucksack somewhere and went out and scrounged for frozen potatoes, whatever. We had this suitcase full Interview with George Pick ia November 13, 1997 of food, which helped a great deal for the next few weeks. But of course it doesn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I mean, we were \u2014 my father was like 90 pounds, my mother was like that too and my grandmother too, and so we really needed to eat something. There was very little food. There were no utilities. Water came about because we were the fru \u2014 we had the ice, you know, in the \u2014 in the yard and we cut it up and boiled it \u2014 boiled it with water, or whatever."

And I probably bounced back in a couple of weeks. We lived in the basement there, and we were trying to find some other arrangements. As the end of February rolled around and Buda was liberated, people were free to move back up. Our old apartment was occupied; they gave it to another family. But the apartment next door, which was the apartment of the Surka\u2019s(ph), the man who was a professional soldier and whose two daughters I used to play with, they went to the west, they left, and their apartment was empty. So Mr. Dudek(ph), the super, suggested that we would go and occupy that place. At that point it was like catcher\u2019s catch can. A number of apartments were also burned out by shells. That particular apartment was in fairly good shape, so we went up and we occupied it. Many months later, the Surkas Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick ia November 13, 1997 came back. There was a law by that time that if somebody occupied an apartment for more than a certain number of months, they were the owners of it. So the Surkas(ph) couldn\u2019t have a claim. They were a sad lot when they came back and I felt very sorry. The yo \u2014 the older daughter died. They went to the west. The father was a Soldier, they got liberated and they came back, and then they disappeared.

There were some new neighbors, some people left, but all in all, we had about 20 apartments in this apartment house, about 15 of them were familiar faces. So what happened next? In March, the schools opened, and my mother and father and I decided that I\u2019m going to go to the Jewish high school. It opened in the \u2014 what used to be the rabbinic seminary, the old building which was in Aboni(ph) Street was not given back at that point.

And one of the things which bothered me is that there was some animosity and definite animosity between both the teachers and the students who were of various persuasions. I remember a particular teacher who didn\u2019t like Orthodox Jews and who hit them, hit their heads, to hit their hats off and \u2014 and things like that, and I could never understand it.

So I must say that I am personally very thankful to him and grateful, because for one, he taught me the love of history, which 1s \u2014 which I wanted to become my \u2014 my profession. Thankfully which did not become my profession, but a lifetime hobby. 1948, Poch(ph) leaves and a number of other teachers leave the school. Passover, Pesach, nine four \u2014 1948. We say goodbye to many of our friends who went to a camp, Zionist camp. After Pesach, our s \u2014 our class of 38 became class of 13. The rest of the people left. We found that they went through the Bricha lea(ph) to Israel. Many of them are still there. And we stayed \u2014 I wasn\u2019t a Zionist \u2014 with this small, shrinking class. They combined the other class with us, which also shrunk, and of the 72 people, we had now a class of roughly 30, a combined class of 30. We had other teachers. Some teachers left with the Bricha, some teachers stayed. I became very interested in acting. We had a little acting group in our school. I became interested. We had put on full three act plays. My father became interested in this school. He wanted to help the school. He found out that the school, of course, lost most of its labs, and he wanted to raise money, so he figured a \u2014a way to ask famous performers to come to the school for nothing, and have fundraisings. And he became involved in many of these kinds of fundraisings. And you would not believe the most famous singers came to sing; Jews and non-Jews alike, and they are always sold out performances, and my father was really a great Interview with George Pick \"\u00b0 November 13, 1997 enterprise [indecipherable] and \u2014 and got enough money to rebuild the physics and biological libr \u2014 labs. And in 1950 or \u201951, they dedicated a greenhouse on the top of the building which my father raised money for. And so my father became the president, or the P.T. and then my mother was very involved and I became involved with the \u2014 on a student level. And it was from \u00b048 to \u201950 - \u00b052. They were \u2014 despite of the fact that \u2014 that there were \u2014 th-there were terrors, and \u2014 and \u2014 and worsening political situation and crisis, there was an island there. The school became a \u2014a separate island, where we had a dicono \u2014 dichotomy where we shared both what we needed to share, such as you know, what you needed to talk about, you know, the great communist camp, and the [indecipherable] the imperialist camp and all this phraseology, which we had to also say, but then we talked about what was the Voice of America saying, you know? So it was a really funny, ironic situation. The same people who were parroting the phraseology were talking about the Voice of America. And the teachers who had to parrot the phraseology also, Marxist phraseology, which they didn\u2019t believe in, who were Hebrew teachers before he beca \u2014 they became Marxist, quote unquote, teachers, who were teaching Yiddish instead of Russian, which they ended up teaching for a while, you know? These teachers knew that this is a big joke, that nobody believes in this, but we pretended that something had to be done, and \u2014 and we did.

            "question": "Did you feel more Jewish now than you had many years ago? Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997",
            "answer": "Absolutely. In the next \u2014 in the first two years after the war, Jewish gymnasium meant that we were not studying, we were \u2014 we do not have Saturday classes, but instead we had to go to the synagogue. So we did. That wasn\u2019t a pleasant thing for me, I was never a synagogue goer. But it made me want to know more Jewish history. It made me much more of a conscious Jew. And after the communist takeover, the synagogue was closed, we couldn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the synagogue of the \u2014 the gymnasium was closed, it was no longer there. So \u2014 but \u2014 but we still had some spark, and \u2014 and many times the spark was nothing more than, I know you are Jewish and you know that I am Jewish, and you can trust me. And that was not always the case, unfortunately, although I think we always knew whom we could trust, within the school. We knew that there were a few people who \u2014 who we could not, including teachers. And this came to a head in 1950. In 1950, there was a letter, which was drafted by a teacher and a student, which was circulated in the school, demanding of the government of nationalizing our school. And they tried to intimidate the students and the teachers. And it came to a head because there was a conference, a te \u2014 a teacher-student-parent conference. And it was supposed to be a secret letter, but somebody told that \u2014 the principal of what was going on. And this \u2014all hell broke loose. And I was there and I remember. There was a parent of a classmate of mine whose \u2014 who told the students and the teacher, who did not want Interview with George Pick \u201d November 13, 1997 to identify himself, that they are cowards, they are damn cowards, and they are traitors. And it was really embarrassing because this was a communist inspired thing, you know. And this was toward the end of the school year, and in the next school year, we had from 200 students, to 45, including the teacher who was \u2014 who \u2014 whom we found out was a\u2014 was a defector. And he left, he became a principal somewhere else, and all these students. But I stayed, and 45 of us stayed. Our class of 30 became a class of 13. This was our sixth grade, 1t was junior high school. And we stayed, and we became more Jewish, although outwardly we could do less. We couldn\u2019t talk about Jewish history. We couldn\u2019t talk about Jewish things. But we could talk about books written by Stefan Zweig and Berfer(ph). And we could sabotage learning Russian, for example. An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian, who did not know from Russian from a hole in the head. I mean, he was always a \u2014a lesson ahead of us, but that was it. And \u2014 and we took this as a joke, inside. But we realized more and more, and more and more keenly that this island for us, is going to come to an end. And then what? And that end came in 1952, when I graduated. Now one of the motivations of the \u2014 all of my classmates who left, was that nobody\u2019s going to be accepted in a university from a parochial school such as the Jewish gymnasium. That was the motivation why they left. It turned out very ironically, that out of the two \u2014 four \u2014 13 of us who graduated, 11 of us were 100 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 accepted. Because the regime in 1952 wanted to show the world that there was such a thing as religious freedom. Much less of the people who left were accepted, percentage-wise. The only two who were not, were bad students, period, who didn\u2019t even want to go to school. I was accepted. And here came the big shock. The big culture shock, because I was trusting to the university, the technical university, Budapest, where we had a class of 1200 people, from 13 to 1200. And we had this huge theater and we were sitting there, you know, men and women. And I found myself in \u2014 very much in a minority. This was the year where it made a difference who\u2019s \u2014 who your parents were; if your parents were peasants or workers, you got accepted regardless of your qualifications. If your parents were businessmen, you wat \u2014 you were rejected. My father was in-between, and I sort of, because he was a \u2014 what they call an intellectual, or a professional, that was not well thought of, but it was better than a businessman for sure. My father wasn\u2019t a businessman by then, he worked for another company. And so in \u2014 I was able to slip in on this, but I found my colleagues to be very different from me. The chemistry worked there. Very quickly we found from each other \u2014 0-of each other, who were Jewish. Of the f\u2014 of the 1200, roughly about 150 of us were Jewish, which was a large percentage. And as I says, the magic of chemistry, I mean, we didn\u2019t know from Adam. We found us, each other and we drifted toward each other. The way the school were \u2014 was Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection 101 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 divided up, we had subspecialties within mechanical engineering \u2014 this was only mechanical engineering. We had specialties on textile engineering, shipbuilding, whatever else. And in my subspecialty, which was naval archy \u2014 naval architecture, we had 30 people, I was the only Jew, and the rest of them were not. And we were sort of drifting in and out. I was \u2014 I was never really very friendly with these people because their culture, their \u2014 their interests were very different from me. I felt sorry for them because they were not really qualified and they were really struggling with the material. They didn\u2019t know elementary algebra when they had to learn calculus, and they really had a heck of a hard time, although the regime gave them all sorts of scholarships and stuff. I have to step back now because there is a \u2014 an important thing which happened in my life, right before graduation, personally. And that \u2014 what happened was that I fell in love, 18 years old. This was right before graduation in February of 1952. Fell in love with a young girl who didn\u2019t understand my \u2014 my feelings, and I was very brokenhearted when my feelings were not reciprocated. And I was so brokenhearted that I fell sick. They thought I had mononucleosis and other diseases and I was in the hospital for a month. And this was in February - March of *52, just before graduation. And my wa \u2014 mother and father were worried that I was going to se \u2014 lose that year. But my colleagues were very nice and they brought me up to date very f\u2014 very fast. Then April roll \u2014 rolled along, and walking 102 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 on the street, in a nice, bright, April afternoon, I met this girl who was very familiar. Made a long story short, it was the girl, Judith Kerienyi(ph), whom I met five years earlier in a camp. Then we started to talk, she was, at this point, just graduating from college. She became a singer, she never married. Didn\u2019t marry the \u2014 broke off with the fianc\u00e9, and she was single. I was 18, she was 22 - 23. And it was a romance, and it was maybe an antidote to the love, the unrequited love I had before. It became a very hot romance, not to my mother\u2019s liking and my father\u2019s liking, who felt that I should really learn and study. The way it went in our school system is that we finished the school early, in May, and then we had six weeks of real study, after which we had a five hour oral exam. And it was almost like a PhD thing. And the six weeks we supposed to cram in everything we need to know about the oral. And we had these little [indecipherable] things, they had hundreds of questions. We knew the questions, we just needed to learn the answers. Of course, that was the trick, you know, you can\u2019t learn eight years of answers in two months. You really had to learn some other things. But at that point, you know, the \u2014 the summer was full blown and \u2014 and I was too interested in \u2014 in \u2014 in everything, mostly Judith, and less interested in the study. But I studied a little. And \u2014 and it was just the hottest romance we had. It was sort of crazy. The \u2014 her parents worked, my parents worked, so both of our apartments were vacant during the day and we 103 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 took advantage of it. And it was my real \u2014 first real romance. I mean, I had some sex before, but they were occasional type things, mostly prostitutes. This was really a woman. I didn\u2019t know what \u2014 and she didn\u2019t know how to handle it either. Which was too bad because she was 22, I was 18. If I didn\u2019t know how to handle it, well, that was something, but she \u2014 she should have known better. Made a longer story short, she became pregnant, and of course, my father and I didn\u2019t see eye to eye through this. I wanted to marry her, of course, it was moral obligation. My fa \u2014 my mother told me the same. My father said absolutely not, I am \u2014 you are a minor. In \u2014in Hungary you were a minor until 21, and I\u2019m not giving your permission and that\u2019s that. Make the long story short, we didn\u2019t marry and she had an abortion. And there is a letter which I still possess, which my mother wrote to Judith, where it was a woman to woman letter; a very sad one, in fact. And saying that, you know, she understands the \u2014 the pain and the sorrow. But she has to understand that I am too young and I am just starting my \u2014 my schooling, and she should have known better. And that romance stayed with me for a long time. That was really a very potent one in many different respects, and I never forgot it. It was a happy ending, if you want, because she had an abortion, and then she got married and she has children. Nothing bad happened to her. But perhaps I am kidding myself, I don\u2019t know. And I went on to school, and I had this \u2014 and I had another girlfriend about a 104 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 year later, who was more to my level of interest maybe, and same age as I was. And the shock went on for four years, from 1952 to \u201956. I had the same girlfriend this time, Erica was her name. And we had a tempestuous relationship. But there was a \u2014 there was something important which happened, not just with her but with my circle of \u2014 small circle of friends. We still kept going to \u2014 to \u2014 to operas. We went to theater. We kept a cultural core, which the country in itself did not, you know, they \u2014 they sort of sank into this Bolshevik slide. But we kept a western level of culture, and I think that kept our humanity, too, in a \u2014 1n a great degree. Between 1952 and \u201956, times were hard, and I was working very hard in \u2014 in school, trying to earn my college tuition, which I did. We were not rich, and I really needed to work. In the summertime, I did. I went to \u2014 this was not my choice, I had to do work once \u2014 one month every summer, work \u2014 we got paid \u2014 in industry. And one month every summer, we had to go to the \u2014 to the army. And I had a hard time in the army, I must tell you. Both \u2014 I had three summers which I had to go to the army, and all those three summers were very, very hard for me, I was not cut out to be a soldier. And that in is \u2014 in itself a story of itself, but I\u2019m not going to go in there. Fifty-six came around. The winds of change started to be felt, and then tragedy struck. My father all of a sudden got sick and died. He got celebra \u2014 cerebral hemorrhage. He was a chain smoker, and finally got to him. This was at the end of March, right Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 105 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 during my period of exams, final exams. And I was very scared, and I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I was 22. I had a ver \u2014 a very good friend, his name was Dionege(ph) Brock(ph), he was stud \u2014 he was studying to be a rabbi; in fact, he was already a \u2014 an ordained rabbi and I asked him what he thinks, what he thought. He knew Erica very well, he knew me very well. He was a very, very close friend. He sort of said look, I think you should pull together. You should have a better \u2014 a bigger family. You should really be not one \u2014 I mean you \u2014 my family, my real family was not very close knit, particularly after my father died. In fact, even in the last few years before my father died, my mother and father sort of drifted apart, and I drifted apart from my father. And I drifted \u2014 the only person I had close was my mother. I had a couple of cousins I wasn\u2019t that friendly with. My maternal grandmother died. My paternal grandparents still had this family gathering every Sunday, but after 18 I didn\u2019t want to go. I found them strange, I had nothing to say to them. So here, after my father died, I had literally very few people to go to. And I was scared, so Erica\u2019s family, she had a sister and mother, father; they were very nice people, I liked them, and I liked Erica. And \u2014 and essentially I felt that maybe this 1s the time when \u2014 when I should have my own, and then I engaged \u2014 I became engaged to her. And we had an engagement in August. And we were planning to get married after I graduated from school, which was at the fall of 1956. It was going to 106 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 be in October of \u201956. And in fact, in October of \u201956 \u2014 I just completed my last exam on the 22\u2122 of October. The 23\" of October became a notable day, but for me the 224 was the \u2014 the real clincher. There was a meeting late in the afternoon, right after my exam, where I went to, student meeting, which lasted until three o\u2019clock in the morning, and which, at the end, we declared that Hungary must be an independent state and should declare neutrally \u2014 neutrality and the Russians, we demanded the Russians get out. And we agreed that on the 23\" in the morning, we would all come back to the university and we would have a \u2014 a demonstration. Came October 23\", I went to the university, we waited until late afternoon, we finally got permission for the demonstration. I was there in Parliament Square, and then I went home and then the shooting war started. I went back to the university about a week later, and I participated in some of the \u2014 the skirmishes which had happened there.

But there was not very much time for thinking here, because there was a war going on and for two weeks there was a \u2014 a real fighting. I mean, at that point we went \u2014 everybody from the building where we lived when down to the basement, just like we had in 1944, and \u00b045. It was artillery duels. And by November, by the 20\" of November, the inside of the downtown was completely demolished again. I mean, 10 years after the war, the downtown area looked just like it did in 1945. Twenty-second of November \u2014 oh, during this period of time, we 108 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 are listening to radio free Europe and a voice of America. And I was particularly appalled by the fact that I was sitting in Elizabeth Street, in a basement, while a bunch of people are already sending messages from Austria to their relatives, saying that they are already in Austria and they don\u2019t know whether they are going to Australia or Canada yet. And I\u2019m sitting as \u2014 like a rat in a basement in Budapest. And I, just to mys \u2014 I am saying to myself, I mean, how many mistakes can I make? I mean, my mother and father made enough mistakes. I\u2019m not going to make the same. So, on the spur of the moment, I called my fianc\u00e9e and a friend, that in the next morning we are going to meet in [indecipherable] railroad station and then we\u2019ll see what happens. And I bicycled there, because there was nothing else. Said goodbye to my mother. The decision took all of a half an hour, and in the next morning we met at the railroad station. We had a vague plan, which 1s to go to a border town and then feel our way around. We never got there. After the \u2014 the \u2014 this is chaos now, there is no central government. The Russians are occupying part of the country, not all of it. There 1s still fighting going on in the countryside. Railroads have no schedule, government is nonexistent. People are doing their thing. Obviously a lot of them are already outside of the country. The train was completely packed, maybe a thousand people. And shortly after we started, we found out that most of the thousand people had the same idea, to go to the western 109 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 border and get out. We were told that it\u2019s dangerous to keep maps, so we throwed the maps away. I had a couple of things in my pocket, two overcoats and a few other things. Couple of pieces of jewelry sewn into my pocket and who knows who to bribe, how to do whatever is going to happen. We had no idea."

So I didn\u2019t have much of a choice and I really wanted to leave. I \u2014 I thought this was the most psychologically opportune moment in the world for me. I had completed my undergraduate education, and here is an opportunity I would \u2014 would pay, you know, I would take whatever chances there was. To make the long story short, the train never reached the town where we went to. It stopped in a smaller town, some 20 \u2014 25 miles from the border. We slept there, and the very next morning went to the station, we got into a cattle train. The cattle train stopped in the middle of the day, in the middle of nowhere, and then we walked for two days, and ended up at the border.

That haystack \u2014 beyond that haystack are the Russian, beyond that haystack are the Hungarian communists, but in-between is okay. And that\u2019s what we did, we went in between. The only problem was that right before no man\u2019s land, there was a quarter of a mile of completely cleared land, and behind that there were towers, watch towers."

            "answer": "Probably. I do not know. At that point I was only thinking about the now and the then. Th-The moment. We knew that we had to go \u2014 go through. We knew that we also had an excellent chance of being shot in the back from the watchtowers. We also knew that in front of us, which used to be a minefield, the mines were removed a few months before, and we have no other barrier. And this was the chance. And I think there are some points in life when one does not think too much, and hesitate too much, because if one does, one gets paralyzed. So what I just did, I started to curse in Hungarian, started to yank my fianc\u00e9e as fast as I could. We ran though this 111 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 part, and it took us probably all of two minutes, but it 11 \u2014 seemed like an hour. And then we were there, we were \u2014 we were in no-man\u2019s land, we saw the Austrian flags, and we were on the other side, and then in about five minutes later, the Austrian border patrol intercepted us. We didn\u2019t speak the language, but they didn\u2019t want. Turned out, when we ww-went to Lutzmannsdorf, which was the first little town, is that the night before, the border police all defected, and so nobody was up there, but I didn\u2019t know that. So my \u2014 my luck was still \u2014 still with me. And then the very next day, the Joint came to Eisenstaedt, which was the next largest city. They took us to Linz. It was already organized, all the hotels in Linz, which was Hitler\u2019s hometown, were reserved for the Jews, and that was an ironic twist of fate. It was Wiesenthal \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you know the name Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal, who was in charge of that operation. We had hundreds of Hungarian Jews there. The non-Hungarian \u2014 Hungarian non-Jews were thrown into a camp, and we were there for three weeks. Meanwhile, the Joint fed us and paid our hotel room. There came recruiters from Canada and from the United States. When they found out that I was an engineer, young engineer, they said absolutely, you should come. When they found out that I had an uncle here, they said no problem at all. And three weeks later, on the 19\" of December of 1956, our plane touched down in Newark, and we went to Camp Kilmer, and a day later I was in New York City.

Mauthausen is ina fantastic place, it\u2019s on the top of a hill. Beautiful view, and unspeakable horrors. In \u00b056, Mauthausen was very different, I am sure, than what it is now. It was much closer to what it was in 1944, and we had a vivid sense of what had \u2014 what must have been. And \u2014 and it certainly recalled all the horrors which we read about and which we heard about from the surviving friends and relatives who came back and who \u2014 some of whom came back from Mauthausen.

And then the next morning, as I mentioned, we were bound to go to \u2014 to Salzburg and then back and forth until we 114 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 got to the plane. Prior to leaving, finding ou \u2014 we only found out that we were coming to the United States about a week before we left. We did not know precisely what was going to happen, how long things would take. And shortly after we left Hungary, my mother and I, and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents were in daily telephone contact. The original plan was that her \u2014 her parents and my mother would essentially come to Austria and then we would meet there. The peasant who helped us over, indeed went to \u2014 to Budapest and he on \u2014 he also told them that they could come with him and he would help them. But they didn\u2019t want to take the chance. It started to be fairly late in December. My mother and a cousin of mine went down to Szeged, which is close to the Yugoslavian border. They tried it there, they couldn\u2019t do it, they were turned back. And I told my mother not to go anywhere, just stay in Budapest and see what happens and leave the country legally. I didn\u2019t want to wait for her because by then we had the papers and I didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to come to the United States. So, late at night on the 19\" of December we touched down. On the 20\", I met my uncle, who was very strange, or somewhat strange, told me that you don\u2019t need those Jews. You come with me, I live in New Jersey, and Ill take care of you. I told him that, that\u2019s nice, but I came with my fianc\u00e9e and I\u2019m not going to let her just drift away. He reluctantly took her also with him, and us. We went to this New Jersey place, it\u2019s 115 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 Wharton, New Jersey, it\u2019s a small town, small Hungarian town, sort of. Most of the Hungarians who live there, lived there since either the 20s or 30s, or after the war, which meant that most of them were Nazis. Now my uncle 1s a fisi\u2014 was a physician. I didn\u2019t know it then, but I found out very soon that he converted, and he wanted to keep his Jewish origins a deep, dark secret. This led to a fallout, and a very irreconcilable difference between him and me. Until I left Hungary, I went to say Kaddish for my father every day. When I came to this country, I couldn\u2019t. There was no Jewish synagogue in Wharton. My uncle arranged for me to have a job, mean \u2014 two \u2014 two weeks after I came, as well as my fianc\u00e9e. She was a chemist, she spoke English, she got a fairly good job. I got a general helper\u2019s job in a small factory, not a very satisfactory job for an engineer, but that was what I cou-could have. What \u2014 and it went on for a couple of months, but what really broke things 1s that in March was my Yahrzeit, and my fianc\u00e9e and I had decided to go to the next town, which had a little, small synagogue. And we \u2014 to say Kaddish. So I went to say Kaddish, and there we met a friend of my uncle\u2019s whom we \u2014 knew we were Jewish. And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and his fianc\u00e9e in a synagogue. You know, ho \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s going on? Well, my uncle was quite furious about this and told me that \u2014 why didn\u2019t I tell him this, he would have taken me a hundred miles somewhere, where nobody knew him. So it Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 116 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 was a big fallout. I wrote to my mother very angrily, and so angry that I forgot to put the address. And it \u2014 the letter was intercepted by the mailman, who was a Hungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian priest of the town, who opened the letter and in short order found out who the letter came from, and with e \u2014 much glee I am sure, gave it to my uncle, who almost killed me. And wrote a letter to my mother that I will end up in a gallows in this country and I will \u2014 and I am just a terrible person. My mother, who was absolutely petrified as to what will happen to me. Anyway, make the long story short on that, I was able to get a scholarship at Temple University to learn English, and in March of 1958, which was \u2014 \u00b057 rather, sorry, three and a half months after I went to live with my uncle, I left. My fianc\u00e9e stayed there. I went to vi \u2014 to Philadelphia, I stayed there for over a year. My fianc\u00e9e and I sort of broke up at this point. She moved to New York, and later on she got married. My uncle and I broke up quite a bit, quite severely, and my mother left Budapest in August of 1957, with a visa to Israel. She never went to Israel, she stayed in Italy. My uncle, who was her brother, helped him \u2014 her a bit, however, in reality what he did 1s he told me that I have to help my mother. And I sent my uncle a certain amount of money every month so that he would send it to my mother. After Temple, I got a job as an engi \u2014 junior engineer at Westinghouse, and I was there for about four months, after which I got a scholarship at Drexel and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with George Pick m7 November 13, 1997 I started to study engineering. And I did that until March of \u201958, at which time I found out that my mother was going to come to the United States and she will be coming in the next six months. And my uncle very specifically told me that he was not going to help my mother come to the United States, or help her when she\u2019s here. So I had no choice in the matter, I quit school. I went to New York. I was unemployed there for a little while, and then my friends have it \u2014 my friend\u2019s help, I got a job. And with another interesting story, I met a Russian princess who helped me to get the job here in Washington. This Russian princess happened to be the cousin of the Lazar(ph). Her name was Princess Trumbetskoy(ph), and for some reason and another, hil \u2014 she liked me. And she called Cardinal O\u2019 Boyle, who was the chancellor of the Catholic University of America and told him that, here is this refugee boy, and that she would like to help him. And I got a interview, and I got a job as an instructor there. I also enrolled in graduate school there, I stayed there for seven years. I taught there mechanical engineering, a-and endi \u2014 ending up as an as- assistant professor and receiving my Master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering in 1962. In 1960, I met a young, Jewish girl, and we got married that summer. That marriage was a disaster and we divorced nine months later. Two months after I came to Washington in \u201958, my mother arrived here. And I live with my mother from \u00b058 until 64. And I worked in the university and my mother \u2014 most of the 118 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 time my mother didn\u2019t work, essentially. She found a little job to get a social security, finally. And the university was \u2014 the university experience was \u2014 was not as rewarding as I was hoping for, it \u2014 it\u2019s a small school. At that time Catholic University was a rather backwards school in terms of theology. They still didn\u2019t step out to the 15\" century, and although they tolerated me as a Jew, they didn\u2019t tolerate me as a divorced Jew, and I got some flack and by the time I realized that that\u2019s not much of a future for me, I got another job, and I left. Well, actually, divorce wasn\u2019t as bad as my remarriage in 1964. I met another Jewish girl here, and we married. And that \u2014 after that, things became very intolerable. By then I only worked part-time at school. I got a job in a research inst \u2014 a research in \u2014 firm, a small firm, and it was very interesting. One thing which happened after I got my citizenship in 1962, shortly after I got my degree, 1s I got my passport, and I took advantage of still working in a university and I went to Europe for two months, which was the first time since \u201956, and the first time I really had a chance to travel. And it was a fabulous two months of \u2014 of \u2014 of not just vacationing, but \u2014 but discovering western Europe. It was very interesting, because I sailed on a ship, which was called the USS France. On the manifesto of that ship, there was a girl, her name was Toby Yaspar(ph). She became my wife a year later. We didn\u2019t know that we were sailing on the same ship, or if we were traveling together. We met in a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 119 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 \u2014in a Jewish get together, about a half a year later. In 1966, I went to join the \u2014 work for the navy. At that time I already finished all the courses which I needed for my PhD, and I needed a thesis. And the university had no laboratory which was really capable of doing anything. So one of the lecturers there, who worked for the David Taylor Model Basin, told me to come to work for him, and then I can work on my thesis there, which is what I did. I worked there 11 years. I worked there in high energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my thesis. I never got my degree, because by the time I wrote my thesis, I lost my minors, which was nuclear engineering, and I just didn\u2019t \u2014 I was in \u2014 1n school studying 12 years at that point, and I had enough of it. And I really didn\u2019t think that I needed it. So I had all the PhD courses finished, and I \u2014 the thesis finished, the comprehensive was the only thing I didn\u2019t. It was 11 years of research; nice years, interesting research. I wrote more than 50 papers. I was involved in the professional development there. And then in 1977, I had an opportunity to get a promotion somewhere else, which I did. I moved from 19 \u2014 from Maryland where | lived, to Virginia. Unfortunately, my family life did not turn out as well as my career. After six years, my wife and I, with mutual consent got divorced. Reason why we did \u2014 and this was a \u2014 again a fairly long story, is I had a problem having children, wanting children, and she wanted children. We went through three years of therapy and the therapy resolved nothing except that her Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 120 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 biological clock was running and that the only way that she could have a child is if she will marry somebody else."

I didn\u2019t think that I would be a very competent father after which I went through, and the father which I \u2014 whom I had, whom I adored in one sense and in another sense I was very ambivalent about, and I was afraid that I would be just like him and I would be incompetent and I didn\u2019t want anybody to have that kind of a life. I went through three more years of therapy after this, because I wasn\u2019t sure that \u2014 1f it was the final decision, but it was. Then we divorced in \u201973 - \u201974. And it was during our separation when I went to Israel the first time. It was a fantastic experience in 1970. It was a real revelation, and the first time in my life, perhaps, I felt home. And I didn\u2019t feel home in a sense that I wanted to live there, but I felt a real close kinship. I had many friends there, and \u2014 and the land was just indescribable. I went back two more times in the next 15 years after that. I traveled a great deal, I was single for 20 years. I traveled every year abroad, from the Far East to the Middle East to Europe many times. My career went fine. I worked for the navy two more jobs. From 1977 to \u201988, I worked for a high energy laser project, where I became a project manager, and it was a very exciting, new edge, high \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 121 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 high tech e \u2014 envelope program, edge of the envelope program. And the next one is \u2014ha-happened from 1988 to 1994, where I worked for a multi-national project office, which was the NATO [indecipherable] office, where I very \u2014 where I jokingly said I wanted this job because I \u2014 al-always in my job I was the only one with an accent, and this \u2014 in this office, I would be in the majority, having 13 different nations, and people from 13 different nations work there, although I was the only Hungarian. And we had a lot of fun, it was a very interesting project, developing a \u2014 a vertical missile. And I was very instrumental in that. After the project was over, which was in 1993, unfortunately things for the navy became a little bleak, and the technical challenges \u2014 whereas the money sort of went away. And at the end of 1994, I decided to \u2014 to retire. There were two things which happened in the early 90s. One is that my mother got sick at age 89. We lived apart, but very close for 20 years. Now, we moved back together, she moved back. She was an invalid and I took care of her for 18 months. And the last 18 months of her life perhaps was the happiest for many years for her, in spite of her sickness. She felt that we were again together. In her 90\" birthday she beca \u2014 she got the heart failure. They pulled her out for some reason, she lived six more weeks. And then in May of 1991, she died of heart failure, her fourth. In 1990, after some unsuccessful relationships, some long term, some short term, I met a woman who was as far 122 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 away from my culture as anybody could be. She wa \u2014 she\u2019s Mexican, her name is Letitia. And what I found out, actually it was in 1991, and I found out that when my mother got sick, that my American girlfriend didn\u2019t stick out with me, but this woman, whom I met only two or three weeks earlier, did. And she stuck with me for a year and a half almost, with \u2014 under these conditions and \u2014 and I found not only a kinship, but also love. We got married in 1992, and we are still married. She works in the Mexican embassy and we are pretty happy now. So I think that\u2019s the end of the story."

I am a survivor and I had a responsibility and a mission until I can, and I\u2019m capable of, to associate myself with projects which have something to do with the Holocaust. My awareness started before the museum, in the mid \u2014 mid-80s, when Holocaust became a subject, which they spoke again about. As you know, the Holocaust was a taboo subject, even in this country, for many years. Although I read a n\u2014 a number of books, it\u2019s astonishing how little came up between say 1956 and 1986. There were a few books only, and not very much of the Holocaust. I think where I became more aware is the gathering. I was a volunteer there, because I felt that I was really not a survivor, that \u2014 that, you know, this was for the older survivors, and the concept of child survivor did not hit me at that point. It hit me a couple of years later, when I started to read about child survivor groups. And in 1991 I got associated with a group here in Washington, called the Washington-Baltimore area child survivors, and I became very active. We had a conference in 1991, and at that time I knew about the museum, and I became very interested in that, as well as the child survivor group. I 124 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 started to write, I started to read more, I started to speak to groups. And by 1992 - 1993, I was a \u2014a full-fledged volunteer who is \u2014 was more than eager to do something, and I liked the idea of wanting to educate the public, as well as others, about the Holocaust. I felt that the people, even the Jewish people, were ignorant and that they really need education, and I felt that the museum was a \u2014 was the vehicle for that. And so when we finished, I was more than eager to start working there. The first thing I did is I, when the opportunity arose, I \u2014 I completed the learning center specialist course, and I finished another cor \u2014 specialized course for \u2014 for student, and then for teacher guides in the permanent exhibition, which I still can do, and do occasionally. And then I got associated with the speakers\u2019 bureau in 1980 \u2014 in 1995. And in 795 - \u201996, I\u2014 I spoke to a number of outside groups: among them Pentagon, a number of army establishments, schools, synagogues and churches. And I feel that \u2014 that that aspect of \u2014 of my work, in conjunction with the museum is very appropriate for me as a \u2014 as a survivor."

One aspect of that answer is that the museum, in some respects become a bureau \u2014 bi \u2014 be \u2014 is becoming a bureaucracy, just like any other bureaucracy and it kills initiative. And there are some \u2014 there were some very bright people there, with ideas and initiatives, who were stifled and who were frustrated and who find \u2014 found a dead end situation there, and left. They 132 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 were not just a bunch of young people who left, whom I knew and sympathized with, and who would have loved to stay in a museum if they have seen for themselves some \u2014 some way up and some way to develop.

It is not just a matter of money, I think it\u2019s a matter of reputation, and I think the \u2014 the institute started out as a world class \u2014 world class institution, and I am not positive that it still maintains that status today, and I think it should.

For example, in \u2014 in west Europe, the ghettos were very different. I think that there should be exhibits about the Hungarian Jews, and this is not because I am a Hungarian Jew, but because the Hungarian Jewish story is very different from the story of the Polish Jews or the Lithuanian Jews, and it \u2014 in my estimation it\u2019s underrepresented in the \u2014 in the main exhibit, anyway. So it should \u2014 it should find someplace else.

His answer was, well, as long as my theory of relativity holds up, the Germans will say I\u2019m German, the 138 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 Americans will say I\u2014 I am American, and of course the Jews will say \u2019'm Jewish.

I \u2014 I think it is \u2014 is sort of a very simp-simplified question when one asks, who, what is, in what component. I \u2014 I must say, I love Hungarian literature, and I like Hungarian art and music. I love American literature, but I love a lot of \u2014 lot of other things. And my hobbies, for example are more universalist than either Hungarian, American or Jewish. But I lo \u2014 but there are components of all three, which I love, and then there are things which are associated with neither.

I believe that the vast majority of the teachers and certainly the students, who will be teaching Holocaust studies and who will be learning Holocaust studies would be Christian. I had had very uneasy few hours, few days in the museum about anti-Semitism. And this is specifically in the Belfer conference this year, where I was \u2014 where I am \u2014 was looking at the struggle of non-Jewish teachers, trying to teach non-Jewish teachers about the central \u2014 centrality of anti-Semitism and church anti-Semitism in the Holocaust. And the difficulties which these teachers had with the acceptance of this idea. And I was very concerned because I feel that if these teachers would simply ignore this, you know, wa \u2014 one of the \u2014 one of the teachers said well, what happens if e \u2014 we teach it different? And he says, well, you have a moral obligation to teach it this way. Well, that\u2019s nice. I always believe in moral obligations, but I heard of very spec \u2014 spe-specific and fairly practical objections. For example one black teacher got up \u2014 very few black teachers participated in this, said hey, I came from Tennessee from the Bible Belt. I cannot teach the Baptists that their belt \u2014 their \u2014 their New Testament is wrong. I can\u2019t teach that, you know, I mean if the Jews are right, then they are wrong. How do I do this? And I was really concerned and I am \u2014 [| think that this 1s a great central concern and should be of the education department to \u2014 to teach the Holocaust and the centrality of the a \u2014 of \u2014 of the anti-Semitism in such a way that 140 Interview with George Pick November 13, 1997 the teachers can accept it. I\u2019m not talking sugarcoating. I am talking truth, or I am talking about acceptable ways, so they can teach it. If you teach it without acceptable ways, then it won\u2019t be taught. And if it is not taught, then the great point of the Holocaust, the great cause of the Holocaust is going to be lost. It\u2019s not enough to teach what happened, they must teach why it happened. And they cannot shirk from the fact that it largely happened because of the centuries of art \u2014 of anti- Semitism. But how do you package it, how do you do this so that the teachers can teach it and can accept it themselves? I talked to teachers afterwards, they really are struggling. I mean, they \u2014 they hear their own priests, they have their own beliefs, and then they hear this, and they don\u2019t know how to resolve it. I think this needs to be really considered and reconsidered in the museum, and that\u2019s not a small amount of work either. That\u2019s my parting shot for this."
