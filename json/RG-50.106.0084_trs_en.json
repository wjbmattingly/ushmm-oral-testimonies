And some of my relatives also lived in Transylvania, so they became Romanian. And this was the situation between the two wars. We were a fairly closely knit family. People were keeping in touch with each other. And I know, for example, of what my great-grandparents did. One was on my father\u2019s side, a physician. And the other one on my father\u2019s side was a merchant, an importer, who imported mostly fruits and spices. My grand \u2014 great-grandparents on my mother\u2019s side, one owned a lumberyard, and the second one was a lawyer. And so I have quite a bit of \u2014 of information about them.

According to the laws, which were designed to squeeze the Jews out of the economic life of Hungary, a Jew could not practice business. But what they did, what the Jews did is they hired a Christian person who would then take out the business license, and they would work under him.

I remember also 12 years later in 1956, when the Russian tanks rumbled on the same street, toward the center of the city. But on that 19\" of March, it was absolutely frightening because we did not know what was going to happen. We knew that something terrible had happened. We heard the radio, and it was, you know, every hour on the hour there were more things, saying, you know, orders given to various units. Hungarian units do this, you know, fari \u2014 code words or code numbers, you know, 12th Hungarian division, be alert, or bring \u2014 bring yourselves to whatever city, and so forth. And what I remember is the confusion, and the \u2014 the disbelief that this could happen to us, and the \u2014 an-and the belief that \u2014 that now, something which we didn\u2019t think would happen, will. And of course, the optimist would say well, you know, what can the Germans do\u2019? The Germans came in because \u2014 we know why they came in, because the Russians are pushing the German army toward the west and the Germans want to make sure that the \u2014 the German army has a retreat, you know, it wants to make sure that \u2014 that \u2014 that it could retreat. We also knew somewhat earlier that the Hungarian government was already discussing peace feelers with \u2014 with the Brits, and that that government was quite liberal and looked the other way. Well, that all changed on that day. In three days a new government was sworn in, Dome Sztojay, who was a-\u2014 p-prior to this was the \u2014 the ambassador of Hungary to Berlin. And he This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

There were these Germans in the west side of Hungary, groups of Germans living there, we called them Schwabs. They were the \u2014 th-the ethnic Germans, and Szt\u00e9jay was one of them. And his government was containing the extreme Nazi elements. The only thing which was relatively heartening to us is that the \u2014 that Horthy, who was the head of the government, stayed. Now, we found out that Horthy was out of the country, and \u2014 but he came back later that afternoon. He was with Hitler, and of course that was the trick Hitler used; while Horthy was out, that\u2019s when the \u2014 they came. We also found out that a couple of days later, that Eichmann and company also showed up in Budapest. The reason why I know this is that my mother had an uncle who was a very prominent lawyer, and who was still practicing law in 1943. And the reason why he was \u2014 were two reasons. One is that he was a World War I hero, a very decorated captain of the Austro-Hungarian army, and he was exempt from Jewish law. And secondly, he was a good friend of the German ambassador, Jakov. Well, Jakov left, Veesenmeyer came in. And va \u2014 before Jakov left, he told my Grand-uncle Paul, Paul Kornhauser, whose son was lost in Voronezh, that Paul, things are changing. But Paul was a Germanophile all his life, a-an admirer of Germany. Never really believed that anything could happen to him. He was a prominent Jew. He was not very religious, but he was very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Many of the Jewish leaders told him that he\u2019s on a list, that he should go into hiding. Well, he didn\u2019t. In fact, when he got his summons, the first one ha \u2014 Eichmann did the same thing as he did everywhere else, he\u2019s \u2014 he summoned the prominent Jewish leaders the first three days or four days after this occupation, to a \u2014 a interim camp, and my uncle, my great-uncle took his dress uniform, his Hungarian dress uniform with all his medals and went in and demanded to be exempted from all these things. Well, they didn\u2019t exempt him at all. In fact, they \u2014 they captured him and in a week, he and a hundred prominent Jewish leaders were sent to Auschwitz and he died there. So we knew that things are happening. We also knew that by the fifth of April \u2014 on the 28\" of March, my 10\" birthday came out a \u2014 the law that we must wear the yellow stars in a week. So by the fifth of April we all wore the yellow stars. That was sort of my 10\" birthday present."

And after three hours we came up, and what we saw was incredible. We had \u2014 this building was a three story apartment building. It was sort of stood by itself. About a hundred yards behind it, there was a six story apartment building, which was hit. And the only thing \u2014 and it was a Jewish house, with the same yellow star like we did. The only thing which stayed up there was one fire wall, and everything was down on \u2014 in a big heap, and people were dead. Across the street there was a villa, a private home, before the raid. Afterwards, there was just a huge crater in the \u2014 crater in the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the earth, and you could see body parts. You could see hands and legs and [indecipherable].

In other words, by this \u2014 by the first of July, most of the Hungarian Jews from the countryside were deported. The only community alive was Budapest. My 150 relatives were largely dead by then.

And they got these 3,000 gendarmes for two reasons; one is to prepare for deportation of the Jews, and number two is to get rid of Horthy. And there was only just a few, the courage of a few army officers who were available and who were ready to follow orders. And one single army unit, a Panzer division was willing to come to Budapest to counteract this \u2014 not necessarily the deportation of the Jews, but the \u2014 the coup against the region. And by the second of July, they were around Budapest, taking up positions. By the seventh of July, they forced these gendarmes to leave. And Horthy declared that that day, that they deportations would stop. And that, of course, saved our lives, because with 3,000 gendarmes, we would be deported in probably a week, or two weeks. I mean, in six weeks, almost 500,000 Hungarian Jews were deported from the countryside. You can imagine that 160 to 180,000 Jews in \u2014 in Budapest, were concentrated, could be deported in a matter of days. But we were not. And that saved our lives. What happened after this was a\u2014a little miracle. Eichmann left. He was frustrated by this inaction by the Hungarian government. And he also knew that things were not going well in the front. What we didn\u2019t know, but he did, and many of the Nazis did, 1s that the Hungarian government started again some negotiations with the western allies and even with the Russians.

And that\u2019s what I did. And the summer went relatively fast, and \u2014 and it was lucky, because my father\u2019s unit was brought back from the western parts of Hungary, where they built fortifications to Budapest. And my father was lucky because his commander was a decent man again. Turned out that his \u2014 the commander\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was Jewish, and she lived in our building. And the commander sort of looked the other way when half of his brigade sort of disappeared every evening, and reappeared every early morning. This was strictly illegal. If a man was caught, he \u2014 under the circumstances, he would be subject to immediate execution. Nevertheless, my father, about two, three times a week, took this chance and came home late at night, after curfew, and Mr. Vargo(ph) let him in. Mr. Vargo(ph) got a few hundred peng\u00e9s for this act, but nevertheless, he took a chance too. My father came in for a few hours, and then he went back early in the morning. So it was happiness that we have seen him at that time. And again, the eternal optimist said well, 1t couldn\u2019t last long. The Russians were already fighting. We knew the Romanians were out of the war already, and \u2014 and they know \u2014 we also knew that, you know, the war couldn\u2019t last for more than a week or two. I mean, the Russians were less than a hundred kilometers from Budapest at this point. So the October 15 rolled around, and October 15 was a very tumultuous and very important day.

Well, I can tell you that 1t was unreal for us. We heard this on loudspeakers, and we went out, and we ra \u2014 ripped al \u2014 our yellow stars off, and we were absolutely hysterical. But the people around us were yelling down from their windows that we are just a little bit too premature, we are a little bit too happy. And they said, well, you dirty Jews, don\u2019t think that you will survive. And indeed, they were more prophetic that we realized, because in a couple of hours, the \u2014 this \u2014 this coup was over. In fact, with German help, the most extreme Nazis, Hungarian Nazis took over. The ar \u2014 the Arrow Cross. And we heard Mr. Vargo\u2019s(ph) radio, he was nice enough to open his doors so people could hear through the radio, when they were looking for Barakti(ph) Burger(ph), who was the extreme Nazi general to come to Budapest immediately to assume the \u2014 the \u2014 the command of the \u2014 the troops. And we heard by the end of the day that Horthy was arrested and then that Szalasi became the head of the state and a new government was sworn in. And this was the 15\". Ten days later, all the women between the ages of \u2014 Jewish women, ages of 18 and 40 were ordered to come to a soccer field, which was the Kishauk(ph) soccer field. And this impacted my aunts, Elizabeth, who was 29, with a baby of three years old, and Yoli(ph), who was 38, with a cousin of mine, who was my age, 11 \u2014 10 \u2014 10 and a half.

And the \u2014 she was one of the ones who were deported. At that time they had no transportation except to walk. They had these death marches. And she made the death march, we knew that she did, because her friends who survived told us. She got to Ravensbrick, and she died a few days before liberation. She was 29. Her baby daughter, Susan, was hidden by an aunt who was not Jewish, who was a wife of my uncle, Lazlo Pick. Now Lazlo Pick was one of the uncles who went to the Ukraine in 1941. He was a thin, skinny man, but he was a tenacious sports person. And he walked the 800 miles. He just got back in March of 1944, just in time for the next round. And he was to be deported in September, but he didn\u2019t wait for that, he took his rucksack, left it and went home, where his wife, in an efficiency apartment not very much bigger than this one, hid him in a closet for three months. And she also hid the baby, my cousin Susan, and they survived.

And they knew the war was going to be over in a week, so they would go there and they would just stick it out there. And my father left, and we didn\u2019t know what happened. This was the sixth of November. We didn\u2019t know anything. On the 22\"4 of November, a \u2014 an army man came over and we were very surprised, I mean, you don\u2019t see an army soldier coming to a Jewish house. And he came in and he wanted to talk to my mother and he handed her a note. And the note said that \u2014 was a one sentence that said, you and George follow this soldier and come immediately where he will take you. Well, my mother was unhappy about this, because she didn\u2019t want to leave my grandmother and everybody. And \u2014 and \u2014 or the \u2014 the message was not to tell anybody anything. And so we went, but my mother didn\u2019t take anything except me with her. And we went to this place, which was a factory building on the other side of town, in a blue collar neighborhood, called Chango(ph) Street. And it was a factory, a textile factory. And the soldier took us there and we met my father. It turned out that this factory was a camouflage place, where they had a bunch of Jews, Jewish men, hidden. The outs \u2014 for the outside world this factory was a factory for army uniforms, Hungarian army uniforms. My father was quite mad at us when he saw that we just came with nothing, and told us to go back immediately, and come the very same evening, come hell or high water.

We got back and we were terribly rushed, because we had maybe a half an hour before curfew. And she threw in a couple of \u2014 she \u2014 the thing which she was most worried about were the family photos. And she threw in a f\u2014 the family photos in a small bag, which I still have. And she also put a little food in, and nothing else. While we were in the midst of this desperate packing, the house was raided by two teenage Nazis. And they came in, one must not been \u2014 I don\u2019t think one was more than 13 and the other one maybe 16 - 17. They had submachine guns with them. And they went and they rampaged the whole place. They \u2014 they broke things, they stole things, they made a mess. They saw these little thing which my mother put together, this little bag, and threw it on the floor and stomped on it, and they terrorized everybody for a couple of hours. And then they finally left. And this was after the curfew. So my mother put everything back and begged Mr. Vargo(ph) to let us out. Again, little money changed hands and Vargo(ph) let us out and we went. And we got there \u2014 this was end of November, toward the end of November, so it was a short day, just like today. And by six o\u2019clock or so, it was quite late la \u2014 quite dark. We got there and my father was really relieved to see us, and told us how he got there, because we didn\u2019t know what was going on.

He was caught in a raid, and he was killed. So my father was in a panic, and went to a friend of his, by the name of Gaykis(ph), who was a Christian business associate, and told him that he needs to hide somewhere. Well Gaykis(ph) told him that he would be happy to help. He gave him this address, it\u2019s Changutca(ph) 6B address, and gave him a note. Told him to \u2014 not to talk to anybody, just go there, hand the note to the commanding officer of this army \u2014 factory. My father did just that, and he handed the note to the soldier and \u2014 and the soldier took back the note to the army commander and then the door opened and he was let in, and the army commander went to see him. The army commander turned out to be a Jew who was a friend of my father\u2019s, and who was playing this role. He was a spit and polished army \u2014 army commander uniform. And he told my father that 65 people who escaped from deportation are also there. They are all men, and he is welcome. And this was in the beginning of November. Toward the middle of November, the man who heard the news \u2014 they were much better informed, of course, than us, that things are happening throughout town, they knew about the deportation of the women.

And it was a lot of fun, and what was fun about it is that this \u2014 this factory had a bunch of machines, big textile machines and we were av \u2014 able to explore these, and a few of us were curious, particularly one fellow. His name was Foti(ph). Foti(ph) Yonchee(ph) and John Foti(ph). And he was my age, and he \u2014 we went on, and we played with these machines and it was just a lot of adventure. We also found that there was a garage, or sort of a shed, which had a \u2014 a lot of hay. And the hay was important because attached to the factory, there was a horse, and a \u2014and a lorry.

And we believed that, it was a good \u2014 good fib, and it was certainly an interesting story. Unfortunately the reality was a little less interesting. What had happened is that on the second of December, we heard a \u2014 a very powerful knock on the door, and there were only f\u2014 a few seconds before we heard running steps. We \u2014 our \u2014 our rooms were on the second floor, second story of this place.

She was about two or three years old and she made a racket and she made her grandpa \u2014 Papa, very, very mad all the time, and she knew how to push his buttons.

And that was another friendship, but she was more interested in another fellow, who was a young man by the name of Bondi(ph).

And he got high fever and he was delirious. And the committee who ran this place had a real dilemma, they didn\u2019t know what to do. If they bring in somebody from the outside, you know, they may jeopardize 129 \u2014 69 people, and if they don\u2019t, they may have Bondi(ph) dead within a day or two. Well, they decided the next day, when Bondi\u2019s(ph) condition became worse, that they were going to bring somebody in. And \u2014 and they brought a Christian doctor in late at night, and he gave him sulfur drugs, it turned out that it was an infection. And in a day or so, he got better. The date is very important, this was the first of December. In the morning of the second, we heard the running steps, and as we were trying to scramble for some shelter, we saw five men running in with submachine guns and yelling and screaming us and saying that we know who you are, you are just a bunch of dirty Jews who are trying to \u2014 to hide here, and we are the police, the Nazi state police. This was the gest \u2014 the Hungarian Gestapo. And they sorted out the men to one side of the room, and women and children to the other and we thought that this was the end. I mean, there was just no way. Within the few seconds of confusion, one man, John dove out the window and into another building.

And they ran after him, they tried to push the haystack, they couldn\u2019t find him. But we were captured, and we thought that this was going to be the end. But for a while nothing happened, and about 20 or 30 minutes later, the detectives, one of the leaders of the detectives came out of the office, and made the following startling statement, that henceforth we are under their protection. And we just couldn\u2019t figure out what happened. There was only one arrest which they made, and that was a na\u2014 aman by the name of Kormus(ph). Kormus(ph) was the \u2014 the leader of the group. Not the commander, but the real leader, the organizer. I didn\u2019t know much about Kormus(ph), but I found out later what \u2014 who he was. They took him and they took us, oh, 10,000 dollars in cash, which by sheer luck was there, because there were a number of extremely rich people in hiding. So in other words, they bribed these detectives. And they left with Kormus(ph) and the money, but they left us behind. After the war I found out that they took Kormus(ph) and they \u2014 they tortured him for two days because they knew that this, our place, was not the only one. In fact, it was a network of four places, all of which Kormus(ph) ran. They knew of three, our place, and another two. And what happened is Kormus(ph) was betrayed. We thought that the doctor did \u2014 betrayed us, it was not the doctor. It was aman by name of Althurdi(ph), who hid Kormus(ph) and his family for months.

He knew of three places Kormus(ph) could have been, and he knew of a fourth place, but he did not know the address of the fourth place. So when he \u2014 when Kormus(ph) was betrayed, they raided three of the four places, Kormus(ph) happened to be in our place. But the fourth place they didn\u2019t know. The fourth place was a factory in another part of Budapest with 350 Jewish slave laborers who were essentially also hiding there. But they, the slave laborers were armed, and they had a mission there. They were armed, and their mission was that they would save the utility companies of Budapest. The paper said \u2014 they were all in army uniforms \u2014 their paper said that they would be the last one to stay, to blow up these utilities, the gas \u2014 gas company, the \u2014 the wa \u2014 the waterworks and so forth, and the electric company. That was the paper which said, but the real mission was to, in fact, save these utilities. And every day they were trained like soldiers. Every night on the other hand, they we \u2014 they had a little factory underneath and they forged papers. And they worked with the Zionists and they worked with our little group, and they were part of the Hungarian Jewish resistance, and Kormus(ph) was the head.

And then Kormus(ph) was sentenced to death, and they took him to the Danube, but he was able to escape. He was very sick because of the fact that he \u2014 they tortured him, but he escaped. He was able to hide, and he survived the war. The other two places which were raided, were not as lucky as we were. They had not many rich people there and they were deported. One was deported on foot to \u2014 to Germany, and they all died. And the second part was taken to political headquarters, and they \u2014 they were among the ones who were sentenced and 70 of them were taken to the Danube, and only Kormus(ph) was able to escape. The rest of them were shot into the Danube. So our group was essentially the \u2014 out of the three groups, our group was the only one who survived. After this happened, the committee who ran the building decided that the 22 children were not safe, so they decided to take us from \u2014 ranging from age of six months to 11 years, I was among the oldest. And one lady who \u2014 who had the six months old son, I think, they took us to a\u2014 a Red Cross building which was in the middle of the city. We took the lorry and the soldier brought us to the Red Cross building. And the idea was that this was a protected building, we would be fed there and we would be okay. That was the theory. The practice was that when we got there, there were about three or 400 children, crying, hungry, dirty and maybe a half a dozen adults. I didn\u2019t like the place at all.

They were the \u2014 they had about 30 buildings throughout town, which were run by the Swiss Red Cross, like the Swedish buildings, this \u2014 but this was not within that enclosure, you know. There was a\u2014 what they called an international ghetto, where the Swiss, the Swedes, the [indecipherable] and the Spanish had rented buildings, about 32 buildings. This was 1n a part of town, and they were all concentrated. That\u2019s where my grandmother and my grand-aunts and uncle were. The Red Cross buildings were throughout the city, they were essentially Swiss protected. Not very well, as you will hear in a minute. But at the time that I got there they were protected, and they were concentrating children there. Now, the idea was that there were adults who would supervise these children, they would bring hoo \u2014 food and everything. Well, the \u2014 that was the theory. The practice was that the building was almost empty. I was put in with a friend of mine, into a room where we had about 35 children of my age. No furniture, we were sleeping on the floor and we were told that there is no food for the day. Well, I wandered around and I was crying, and I met a friend of mine from school there, who was there with his sister. I knew him, his name is Mike Vairmas(ph). He now lives here in this country.

So, a young girl saw me there crying, and asked me why I was crying, and I was saying I was hungry and I was lonely for my mother. This young girl has a boyfre \u2014 had a boyfriend who was in a Nazi uniform, and who told me that he would be more than happy to take me back. Well, I knew that that was not the right answer, and I knew that I had to escape now, cause I knew that if this man would take a \u2014 take me back to where we are hiding, you know, he would betray us. So John Foti(ph) and I decided that in the very next morning, we are going to take off. And the building was locked from the inside, so we couldn\u2019t just walk out. And the next morning when the employees came, there was a kindly lady who came and we asked her to take us out so that we could buy some food. And as she took us out, we ran away from her."

And then they would do something. And so, on the 14\" of December, the ghetto was already established and these policemen told us that they would go ahead, we would be behind them, they would not look back, and nothing else was said. Well, of the 150 people roughly, only 65 arrived in the ghetto. The rest sort of evaporated along the way. My father decided that we have nowhere to hide, so we went back to the ghetto. The ghetto, as I mentioned, was in a very poor section of town, the Jewish quarters. The center of it was a square, Klauzal square, and in that square, or one part of the square was a market. They took us to the market, where the Nazis \u2014 a number of Nazis were there, Hungarian Nazis, told us that, if you have any jewelry, money, they are going to do a body search, and if they find anything, they\u2019Il shoot us. There was a dead body to sh \u2014 to prove the point. And we didn\u2019t have anything, but a couple of people did, and they would throw the \u2014 the jewelry into the sewer rather than giving it to these people. Of the 63 of us who got there, we were separated into several groups. The group which my father and I \u2014 my mother and I stayed with were about 20 people. We were just taken to the other side of the square, is Klauzal square seven, a three story old building.

So they gave us two rooms there, and it was dirty and no food. And I remember that after \u2014 the day after we arrived, my father, who was always enterprising, he was looking around and he found a piece of bread, which must have been six months old. And bugs were jumping all over the place out of it, but he said, that\u2019s okay, because we\u2019ll toast it and then we can eat it. That\u2019s precisely what we did, somehow we toasted it, bugs all got fried and then we ate a piece of it. That was the food for that particular day. People were not very choosy at that point. My father also went around to see what \u2014 what was the situation in the ghetto. The ghetto was \u2014 th-the area originally was an area for about 12,000 people. By the time we got there, they had about 40,000 people living there, and at its peak they had 70,000 people. So you can imagine that there were not \u2014 there was not much room around."

And it was a good time. I mean, inflation was there for sure, but there were possibilities. And these possibilities ended in 1947. What were the possibilities? Well, one was, you know, we were Jewish and the Joint from the United States had sent food and things, clothing. I remember in 19 \u2014 I believe it was the summer of \u201946, and I went to a camp which was run by the Joint and Zionists. And I was not a Zionist myself. We had a lot of Zionists in our \u2014 in our school, and many of the teachers were Zionists, and they had socialist Zionists, such as the Hashomer Hatzair, and then they had Orthodox. And one of the things which bothered me is that there was some animosity and definite animosity between both the teachers and the students who were of various persuasions. I remember a particular teacher who didn\u2019t like Orthodox Jews and who hit them, hit their heads, to hit their hats off and \u2014 and things like that, and I could never understand it. After \u00b044, how could a Jew hit another Jew because the Jew wears a hat? And there were some very passionate discussions about, you know, Hashomer Hatzair and Irgun and all these others.

And they lived like \u2014 like \u2014 they were told that they were like adults, I mean, 13 - 14 year old kids, they were adults, they could do anything they wanted to. And I was fortunate enough to have my parents, and in a sense I was a little bit jealous that they could do anything and I wasn\u2019t. I was still a son, and I was still a child.

In the next \u2014 in the first two years after the war, Jewish gymnasium meant that we were not studying, we were \u2014 we do not have Saturday classes, but instead we had to go to the synagogue. So we did. That wasn\u2019t a pleasant thing for me, I was never a synagogue goer. But it made me want to know more Jewish history. It made me much more of a conscious Jew.

And that was not always the case, unfortunately, although I think we always knew whom we could trust, within the school. We knew that there were a few people who \u2014 who we could not, including teachers. And this came to a head in 1950. In 1950, there was a letter, which was drafted by a teacher and a student, which was circulated in the school, demanding of the government of nationalizing our school. And they tried to intimidate the students and the teachers. And it came to a head because there was a conference, a te \u2014 a teacher-student-parent conference. And it was supposed to be a secret letter, but somebody told that \u2014 the principal of what was going on. And this \u2014all hell broke loose. And I was there and I remember.

And it was really embarrassing because this was a communist inspired thing, you know. And this was toward the end of the school year, and in the next school year, we had from 200 students, to 45, including the teacher who was \u2014 who \u2014 whom we found out was a\u2014 was a defector. And he left, he became a principal somewhere else, and all these students. But I stayed, and 45 of us stayed. Our class of 30 became a class of 13. This was our sixth grade, 1t was junior high school. And we stayed, and we became more Jewish, although outwardly we could do less. We couldn\u2019t talk about Jewish history. We couldn\u2019t talk about Jewish things. But we could talk about books written by Stefan Zweig and Berfer(ph). And we could sabotage learning Russian, for example. An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian, who did not know from Russian from a hole in the head. I mean, he was always a \u2014a lesson ahead of us, but that was it. And \u2014 and we took this as a joke, inside. But we realized more and more, and more and more keenly that this island for us, is going to come to an end. And then what? And that end came in 1952, when I graduated. Now one of the motivations of the \u2014 all of my classmates who left, was that nobody\u2019s going to be accepted in a university from a parochial school such as the Jewish gymnasium. That was the motivation why they left. It turned out very ironically, that out of the two \u2014 four \u2014 13 of us who graduated, 11 of us were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Because the regime in 1952 wanted to show the world that there was such a thing as religious freedom. Much less of the people who left were accepted, percentage-wise. The only two who were not, were bad students, period, who didn\u2019t even want to go to school. I was accepted. And here came the big shock. The big culture shock, because I was trusting to the university, the technical university, Budapest, where we had a class of 1200 people, from 13 to 1200. And we had this huge theater and we were sitting there, you know, men and women. And I found myself in \u2014 very much in a minority. This was the year where it made a difference who\u2019s \u2014 who your parents were; if your parents were peasants or workers, you got accepted regardless of your qualifications. If your parents were businessmen, you wat \u2014 you were rejected. My father was in-between, and I sort of, because he was a \u2014 what they call an intellectual, or a professional, that was not well thought of, but it was better than a businessman for sure. My father wasn\u2019t a businessman by then, he worked for another company. And so in \u2014 I was able to slip in on this, but I found my colleagues to be very different from me. The chemistry worked there. Very quickly we found from each other \u2014 0-of each other, who were Jewish. Of the f\u2014 of the 1200, roughly about 150 of us were Jewish, which was a large percentage. And as I says, the magic of chemistry, I mean, we didn\u2019t know from Adam.

They didn\u2019t know elementary algebra when they had to learn calculus, and they really had a heck of a hard time, although the regime gave them all sorts of scholarships and stuff. I have to step back now because there is a \u2014 an important thing which happened in my life, right before graduation, personally. And that \u2014 what happened was that I fell in love, 18 years old. This was right before graduation in February of 1952.

Made a long story short, it was the girl, Judith Kerienyi(ph), whom I met five years earlier in a camp. Then we started to talk, she was, at this point, just graduating from college. She became a singer, she never married. Didn\u2019t marry the \u2014 broke off with the fianc\u00e9, and she was single. I was 18, she was 22 - 23. And it was a romance, and it was maybe an antidote to the love, the unrequited love I had before. It became a very hot romance, not to my mother\u2019s liking and my father\u2019s liking, who felt that I should really learn and study. The way it went in our school system is that we finished the school early, in May, and then we had six weeks of real study, after which we had a five hour oral exam. And it was almost like a PhD thing. And the six weeks we supposed to cram in everything we need to know about the oral. And we had these little [indecipherable] things, they had hundreds of questions. We knew the questions, we just needed to learn the answers. Of course, that was the trick, you know, you can\u2019t learn eight years of answers in two months. You really had to learn some other things. But at that point, you know, the \u2014 the summer was full blown and \u2014 and I was too interested in \u2014 in \u2014 in everything, mostly Judith, and less interested in the study. But I studied a little. And \u2014 and it was just the hottest romance we had. It was sort of crazy. The \u2014 her parents worked, my parents worked, so both of our apartments were vacant during the day and we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And it was my real \u2014 first real romance. I mean, I had some sex before, but they were occasional type things, mostly prostitutes. This was really a woman. I didn\u2019t know what \u2014 and she didn\u2019t know how to handle it either. Which was too bad because she was 22, I was 18. If I didn\u2019t know how to handle it, well, that was something, but she \u2014 she should have known better. Made a longer story short, she became pregnant, and of course, my father and I didn\u2019t see eye to eye through this. I wanted to marry her, of course, it was moral obligation. My fa \u2014 my mother told me the same. My father said absolutely not, I am \u2014 you are a minor. In \u2014in Hungary you were a minor until 21, and I\u2019m not giving your permission and that\u2019s that. Make the long story short, we didn\u2019t marry and she had an abortion. And there is a letter which I still possess, which my mother wrote to Judith, where it was a woman to woman letter; a very sad one, in fact. And saying that, you know, she understands the \u2014 the pain and the sorrow. But she has to understand that I am too young and I am just starting my \u2014 my schooling, and she should have known better. And that romance stayed with me for a long time. That was really a very potent one in many different respects, and I never forgot it. It was a happy ending, if you want, because she had an abortion, and then she got married and she has children. Nothing bad happened to her. But perhaps I am kidding myself, I don\u2019t know. And I went on to school, and I had this \u2014 and I had another girlfriend about a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And the shock went on for four years, from 1952 to \u201956. I had the same girlfriend this time, Erica was her name. And we had a tempestuous relationship. But there was a \u2014 there was something important which happened, not just with her but with my circle of \u2014 small circle of friends. We still kept going to \u2014 to \u2014 to operas. We went to theater. We kept a cultural core, which the country in itself did not, you know, they \u2014 they sort of sank into this Bolshevik slide. But we kept a western level of culture, and I think that kept our humanity, too, in a \u2014 1n a great degree. Between 1952 and \u201956, times were hard, and I was working very hard in \u2014 in school, trying to earn my college tuition, which I did. We were not rich, and I really needed to work. In the summertime, I did. I went to \u2014 this was not my choice, I had to do work once \u2014 one month every summer, work \u2014 we got paid \u2014 in industry. And one month every summer, we had to go to the \u2014 to the army. And I had a hard time in the army, I must tell you. Both \u2014 I had three summers which I had to go to the army, and all those three summers were very, very hard for me, I was not cut out to be a soldier. And that in is \u2014 in itself a story of itself, but I\u2019m not going to go in there. Fifty-six came around. The winds of change started to be felt, and then tragedy struck. My father all of a sudden got sick and died. He got celebra \u2014 cerebral hemorrhage. He was a chain smoker, and finally got to him.

And I was very scared, and I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I was 22. I had a ver \u2014 a very good friend, his name was Dionege(ph) Brock(ph), he was stud \u2014 he was studying to be a rabbi; in fact, he was already a \u2014 an ordained rabbi and I asked him what he thinks, what he thought. He knew Erica very well, he knew me very well. He was a very, very close friend. He sort of said look, I think you should pull together. You should have a better \u2014 a bigger family. You should really be not one \u2014 I mean you \u2014 my family, my real family was not very close knit, particularly after my father died. In fact, even in the last few years before my father died, my mother and father sort of drifted apart, and I drifted apart from my father. And I drifted \u2014 the only person I had close was my mother. I had a couple of cousins I wasn\u2019t that friendly with. My maternal grandmother died. My paternal grandparents still had this family gathering every Sunday, but after 18 I didn\u2019t want to go. I found them strange, I had nothing to say to them. So here, after my father died, I had literally very few people to go to. And I was scared, so Erica\u2019s family, she had a sister and mother, father; they were very nice people, I liked them, and I liked Erica. And \u2014 and essentially I felt that maybe this 1s the time when \u2014 when I should have my own, and then I engaged \u2014 I became engaged to her. And we had an engagement in August.

And in fact, in October of \u201956 \u2014 I just completed my last exam on the 22\u2122 of October. The 23\" of October became a notable day, but for me the 224 was the \u2014 the real clincher. There was a meeting late in the afternoon, right after my exam, where I went to, student meeting, which lasted until three o\u2019clock in the morning, and which, at the end, we declared that Hungary must be an independent state and should declare neutrally \u2014 neutrality and the Russians, we demanded the Russians get out. And we agreed that on the 23\" in the morning, we would all come back to the university and we would have a \u2014 a demonstration. Came October 23\", I went to the university, we waited until late afternoon, we finally got permission for the demonstration. I was there in Parliament Square, and then I went home and then the shooting war started.

But there was not very much time for thinking here, because there was a war going on and for two weeks there was a \u2014 a real fighting. I mean, at that point we went \u2014 everybody from the building where we lived when down to the basement, just like we had in 1944, and \u00b045. It was artillery duels.

And I was particularly appalled by the fact that I was sitting in Elizabeth Street, in a basement, while a bunch of people are already sending messages from Austria to their relatives, saying that they are already in Austria and they don\u2019t know whether they are going to Australia or Canada yet. And I\u2019m sitting as \u2014 like a rat in a basement in Budapest. And I, just to mys \u2014 I am saying to myself, I mean, how many mistakes can I make? I mean, my mother and father made enough mistakes. I\u2019m not going to make the same. So, on the spur of the moment, I called my fianc\u00e9e and a friend, that in the next morning we are going to meet in [indecipherable] railroad station and then we\u2019ll see what happens. And I bicycled there, because there was nothing else. Said goodbye to my mother. The decision took all of a half an hour, and in the next morning we met at the railroad station. We had a vague plan, which 1s to go to a border town and then feel our way around. We never got there. After the \u2014 the \u2014 this is chaos now, there is no central government. The Russians are occupying part of the country, not all of it. There 1s still fighting going on in the countryside. Railroads have no schedule, government is nonexistent.

We were told that it\u2019s dangerous to keep maps, so we throwed the maps away. I had a couple of things in my pocket, two overcoats and a few other things. Couple of pieces of jewelry sewn into my pocket and who knows who to bribe, how to do whatever is going to happen. We had no idea."

I knew that some people knew that I was participating 1n the fighting. I knew that the Russians are not going to be very merciful for those who were participating. I could end up in jail, or worse. So I didn\u2019t have much of a choice and I really wanted to leave. I \u2014 I thought this was the most psychologically opportune moment in the world for me. I had completed my undergraduate education, and here is an opportunity I would \u2014 would pay, you know, I would take whatever chances there was. To make the long story short, the train never reached the town where we went to. It stopped in a smaller town, some 20 \u2014 25 miles from the border. We slept there, and the very next morning went to the station, we got into a cattle train. The cattle train stopped in the middle of the day, in the middle of nowhere, and then we walked for two days, and ended up at the border.

I met a\u2014 we met a fellow who told us that he would help us the very next morning, because he knew a way. And we also told him to go back to our parents and see if they would be able to come out. The next morning we went out bright, early morning, and he told us that between those two haystacks, if we stay between them it\u2019s okay. That haystack \u2014 beyond that haystack are the Russian, beyond that haystack are the Hungarian communists, but in-between is okay. And that\u2019s what we did, we went in between. The only problem was that right before no man\u2019s land, there was a quarter of a mile of completely cleared land, and behind that there were towers, watch towers."

We also knew that in front of us, which used to be a minefield, the mines were removed a few months before, and we have no other barrier. And this was the chance. And I think there are some points in life when one does not think too much, and hesitate too much, because if one does, one gets paralyzed.

And then we were there, we were \u2014 we were in no-man\u2019s land, we saw the Austrian flags, and we were on the other side, and then in about five minutes later, the Austrian border patrol intercepted us. We didn\u2019t speak the language, but they didn\u2019t want. Turned out, when we ww-went to Lutzmannsdorf, which was the first little town, is that the night before, the border police all defected, and so nobody was up there, but I didn\u2019t know that. So my \u2014 my luck was still \u2014 still with me. And then the very next day, the Joint came to Eisenstaedt, which was the next largest city. They took us to Linz. It was already organized, all the hotels in Linz, which was Hitler\u2019s hometown, were reserved for the Jews, and that was an ironic twist of fate. It was Wiesenthal \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you know the name Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal, who was in charge of that operation. We had hundreds of Hungarian Jews there. The non-Hungarian \u2014 Hungarian non-Jews were thrown into a camp, and we were there for three weeks. Meanwhile, the Joint fed us and paid our hotel room. There came recruiters from Canada and from the United States. When they found out that I was an engineer, young engineer, they said absolutely, you should come. When they found out that I had an uncle here, they said no problem at all. And three weeks later, on the 19\" of December of 1956, our plane touched down in Newark, and we went to Camp Kilmer, and a day later I was in New York City.

Prior to leaving, finding ou \u2014 we only found out that we were coming to the United States about a week before we left. We did not know precisely what was going to happen, how long things would take. And shortly after we left Hungary, my mother and I, and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents were in daily telephone contact. The original plan was that her \u2014 her parents and my mother would essentially come to Austria and then we would meet there. The peasant who helped us over, indeed went to \u2014 to Budapest and he on \u2014 he also told them that they could come with him and he would help them. But they didn\u2019t want to take the chance. It started to be fairly late in December. My mother and a cousin of mine went down to Szeged, which is close to the Yugoslavian border. They tried it there, they couldn\u2019t do it, they were turned back. And I told my mother not to go anywhere, just stay in Budapest and see what happens and leave the country legally. I didn\u2019t want to wait for her because by then we had the papers and I didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to come to the United States. So, late at night on the 19\" of December we touched down. On the 20\", I met my uncle, who was very strange, or somewhat strange, told me that you don\u2019t need those Jews. You come with me, I live in New Jersey, and Ill take care of you. I told him that, that\u2019s nice, but I came with my fianc\u00e9e and I\u2019m not going to let her just drift away. He reluctantly took her also with him, and us. We went to this New Jersey place, it\u2019s This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Most of the Hungarians who live there, lived there since either the 20s or 30s, or after the war, which meant that most of them were Nazis. Now my uncle 1s a fisi\u2014 was a physician. I didn\u2019t know it then, but I found out very soon that he converted, and he wanted to keep his Jewish origins a deep, dark secret. This led to a fallout, and a very irreconcilable difference between him and me. Until I left Hungary, I went to say Kaddish for my father every day. When I came to this country, I couldn\u2019t. There was no Jewish synagogue in Wharton. My uncle arranged for me to have a job, mean \u2014 two \u2014 two weeks after I came, as well as my fianc\u00e9e. She was a chemist, she spoke English, she got a fairly good job. I got a general helper\u2019s job in a small factory, not a very satisfactory job for an engineer, but that was what I cou-could have. What \u2014 and it went on for a couple of months, but what really broke things 1s that in March was my Yahrzeit, and my fianc\u00e9e and I had decided to go to the next town, which had a little, small synagogue. And we \u2014 to say Kaddish. So I went to say Kaddish, and there we met a friend of my uncle\u2019s whom we \u2014 knew we were Jewish. And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and his fianc\u00e9e in a synagogue. You know, ho \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s going on? Well, my uncle was quite furious about this and told me that \u2014 why didn\u2019t I tell him this, he would have taken me a hundred miles somewhere, where nobody knew him.

I wrote to my mother very angrily, and so angry that I forgot to put the address. And it \u2014 the letter was intercepted by the mailman, who was a Hungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian priest of the town, who opened the letter and in short order found out who the letter came from, and with e \u2014 much glee I am sure, gave it to my uncle, who almost killed me. And wrote a letter to my mother that I will end up in a gallows in this country and I will \u2014 and I am just a terrible person. My mother, who was absolutely petrified as to what will happen to me. Anyway, make the long story short on that, I was able to get a scholarship at Temple University to learn English, and in March of 1958, which was \u2014 \u00b057 rather, sorry, three and a half months after I went to live with my uncle, I left. My fianc\u00e9e stayed there. I went to vi \u2014 to Philadelphia, I stayed there for over a year. My fianc\u00e9e and I sort of broke up at this point.

She never went to Israel, she stayed in Italy. My uncle, who was her brother, helped him \u2014 her a bit, however, in reality what he did 1s he told me that I have to help my mother.

And I did that until March of \u201958, at which time I found out that my mother was going to come to the United States and she will be coming in the next six months. And my uncle very specifically told me that he was not going to help my mother come to the United States, or help her when she\u2019s here. So I had no choice in the matter, I quit school. I went to New York. I was unemployed there for a little while, and then my friends have it \u2014 my friend\u2019s help, I got a job. And with another interesting story, I met a Russian princess who helped me to get the job here in Washington. This Russian princess happened to be the cousin of the Lazar(ph). Her name was Princess Trumbetskoy(ph), and for some reason and another, hil \u2014 she liked me. And she called Cardinal O\u2019 Boyle, who was the chancellor of the Catholic University of America and told him that, here is this refugee boy, and that she would like to help him. And I got a interview, and I got a job as an instructor there. I also enrolled in graduate school there, I stayed there for seven years. I taught there mechanical engineering, a-and endi \u2014 ending up as an as- assistant professor and receiving my Master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering in 1962. In 1960, I met a young, Jewish girl, and we got married that summer. That marriage was a disaster and we divorced nine months later.

She found a little job to get a social security, finally. And the university was \u2014 the university experience was \u2014 was not as rewarding as I was hoping for, it \u2014 it\u2019s a small school. At that time Catholic University was a rather backwards school in terms of theology. They still didn\u2019t step out to the 15\" century, and although they tolerated me as a Jew, they didn\u2019t tolerate me as a divorced Jew, and I got some flack and by the time I realized that that\u2019s not much of a future for me, I got another job, and I left. Well, actually, divorce wasn\u2019t as bad as my remarriage in 1964. I met another Jewish girl here, and we married. And that \u2014 after that, things became very intolerable. By then I only worked part-time at school. I got a job in a research inst \u2014 a research in \u2014 firm, a small firm, and it was very interesting. One thing which happened after I got my citizenship in 1962, shortly after I got my degree, 1s I got my passport, and I took advantage of still working in a university and I went to Europe for two months, which was the first time since \u201956, and the first time I really had a chance to travel. And it was a fabulous two months of \u2014 of \u2014 of not just vacationing, but \u2014 but discovering western Europe. It was very interesting, because I sailed on a ship, which was called the USS France. On the manifesto of that ship, there was a girl, her name was Toby Yaspar(ph). She became my wife a year later. We didn\u2019t know that we were sailing on the same ship, or if we were traveling together. We met in a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

In 1966, I went to join the \u2014 work for the navy. At that time I already finished all the courses which I needed for my PhD, and I needed a thesis. And the university had no laboratory which was really capable of doing anything. So one of the lecturers there, who worked for the David Taylor Model Basin, told me to come to work for him, and then I can work on my thesis there, which is what I did. I worked there 11 years. I worked there in high energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my thesis. I never got my degree, because by the time I wrote my thesis, I lost my minors, which was nuclear engineering, and I just didn\u2019t \u2014 I was in \u2014 1n school studying 12 years at that point, and I had enough of it. And I really didn\u2019t think that I needed it. So I had all the PhD courses finished, and I \u2014 the thesis finished, the comprehensive was the only thing I didn\u2019t. It was 11 years of research; nice years, interesting research. I wrote more than 50 papers. I was involved in the professional development there. And then in 1977, I had an opportunity to get a promotion somewhere else, which I did. I moved from 19 \u2014 from Maryland where | lived, to Virginia. Unfortunately, my family life did not turn out as well as my career. After six years, my wife and I, with mutual consent got divorced. Reason why we did \u2014 and this was a \u2014 again a fairly long story, is I had a problem having children, wanting children, and she wanted children.

I didn\u2019t think that I would be a very competent father after which I went through, and the father which I \u2014 whom I had, whom I adored in one sense and in another sense I was very ambivalent about, and I was afraid that I would be just like him and I would be incompetent and I didn\u2019t want anybody to have that kind of a life. I went through three more years of therapy after this, because I wasn\u2019t sure that \u2014 1f it was the final decision, but it was. Then we divorced in \u201973 - \u201974. And it was during our separation when I went to Israel the first time. It was a fantastic experience in 1970. It was a real revelation, and the first time in my life, perhaps, I felt home. And I didn\u2019t feel home in a sense that I wanted to live there, but I felt a real close kinship. I had many friends there, and \u2014 and the land was just indescribable. I went back two more times in the next 15 years after that. I traveled a great deal, I was single for 20 years. I traveled every year abroad, from the Far East to the Middle East to Europe many times. My career went fine. I worked for the navy two more jobs.

And we had a lot of fun, it was a very interesting project, developing a \u2014 a vertical missile. And I was very instrumental in that. After the project was over, which was in 1993, unfortunately things for the navy became a little bleak, and the technical challenges \u2014 whereas the money sort of went away. And at the end of 1994, I decided to \u2014 to retire. There were two things which happened in the early 90s. One is that my mother got sick at age 89. We lived apart, but very close for 20 years. Now, we moved back together, she moved back. She was an invalid and I took care of her for 18 months. And the last 18 months of her life perhaps was the happiest for many years for her, in spite of her sickness. She felt that we were again together.

And she stuck with me for a year and a half almost, with \u2014 under these conditions and \u2014 and I found not only a kinship, but also love. We got married in 1992, and we are still married.

I am a survivor and I had a responsibility and a mission until I can, and I\u2019m capable of, to associate myself with projects which have something to do with the Holocaust. My awareness started before the museum, in the mid \u2014 mid-80s, when Holocaust became a subject, which they spoke again about. As you know, the Holocaust was a taboo subject, even in this country, for many years. Although I read a n\u2014 a number of books, it\u2019s astonishing how little came up between say 1956 and 1986. There were a few books only, and not very much of the Holocaust. I think where I became more aware is the gathering. I was a volunteer there, because I felt that I was really not a survivor, that \u2014 that, you know, this was for the older survivors, and the concept of child survivor did not hit me at that point. It hit me a couple of years later, when I started to read about child survivor groups. And in 1991 I got associated with a group here in Washington, called the Washington-Baltimore area child survivors, and I became very active. We had a conference in 1991, and at that time I knew about the museum, and I became very interested in that, as well as the child survivor group. I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And by 1992 - 1993, I was a \u2014a full-fledged volunteer who is \u2014 was more than eager to do something, and I liked the idea of wanting to educate the public, as well as others, about the Holocaust. I felt that the people, even the Jewish people, were ignorant and that they really need education, and I felt that the museum was a \u2014 was the vehicle for that. And so when we finished, I was more than eager to start working there. The first thing I did is I, when the opportunity arose, I \u2014 I completed the learning center specialist course, and I finished another cor \u2014 specialized course for \u2014 for student, and then for teacher guides in the permanent exhibition, which I still can do, and do occasionally. And then I got associated with the speakers\u2019 bureau in 1980 \u2014 in 1995. And in 795 - \u201996, I\u2014 I spoke to a number of outside groups: among them Pentagon, a number of army establishments, schools, synagogues and churches. And I feel that \u2014 that that aspect of \u2014 of my work, in conjunction with the museum is very appropriate for me as a \u2014 as a survivor."

            "answer": "Okay, yes, of course. I think that it 1s not a coincidence that in the volunteer corps, probably 95 percent are Jewish, whether they are survivors or non-survivors. I feel that, and I very much encourage anybody who volunteers to volunteer for the museum whether Jewish or non-Jewish. But there 1s, I think, a reason why Jews feel more of a mission there than a non-mission. And I feel the same thing about the staff. I am sorry to say that one of the concerns I have, and not only I, but many others, is that many of the staff, the Jewish staff, 1s leaving the museum, and many of them already have left."

But some senior man \u2014 senior people, senior historians, who had a reputation, and whose reputation enhanced the reputation of the museum, such as the research center. I was very sorry to see Baron(ph) Vaughn(ph) first of all leaving. I was very sorry to see when Sylvia Milton left. And my fear 1s that, with these kind of people leaving the museum, the research institute is not going to be able to attract the type of reputable scientists, such as Browning and others. It is not just a matter of money, I think it\u2019s a matter of reputation, and I think the \u2014 the institute started out as a world class \u2014 world class institution, and I am not positive that it still maintains that status today, and I think it should. And if it doesn\u2019t now, it should certainly strive to do it again. That is an awful lot that institution needs to do, and had the potential to doing it. I think the museum management should definitely strive to \u2014 to nurture that institution, and my impression is that it is not doing that."

For example, in \u2014 in west Europe, the ghettos were very different. I think that there should be exhibits about the Hungarian Jews, and this is not because I am a Hungarian Jew, but because the Hungarian Jewish story is very different from the story of the Polish Jews or the Lithuanian Jews, and it \u2014 in my estimation it\u2019s underrepresented in the \u2014 in the main exhibit, anyway. So it should \u2014 it should find someplace else. The French Jews same thing, and \u2014 and the west European Jews, in a general sense, are also underrepresented, and they should be given at least temporary space.

I was fortunate to be invited a couple of times to speak to them, in a Belfer conference. I was very sorry to see Marshall Sabol(ph) leave, who recognized very early on the potential of the survivor contributions to teachers\u2019 education. After Marshall left, he took some time in doing, and I must say to myse \u2014 to \u2014 must say that I was the one who forced the issue also there, until the a \u2014 the education department recognized the contribution with the educ \u2014 which the survivors could make to education. But I had some memorable instances this year, when I participated in a Belfer conference, not as a speaker, but as just sitting around and listening to others, and having teachers come to me with questions and wanting me to show them the main exhibit and comment on them. And one \u2014 and telling me \u2014 and I have go-gotten letters from them, several, not just this year, but other years, is that their me \u2014 most meaningful experience was to meet survivors. That many things they could learn from books and from exhibits, but the person to person touch was \u2014 was most meaningful for them, and which they hope to transmit to their students. And I really believe that. That was certainly most memorable for me there. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But despite of that, there are certain things obviously, which \u2014 which were closer \u2014 or which are closer to me than other pieces are. For example, the portrait of Raoul Wallenberg. Obviously, the man who saved my life, directly and indirectly and who saved my immediate family\u2019s life, makes a difference to me. But \u2014 but everything is meaningful. And of course th-the-the large pictures which \u2014 which show the Hungarian Jews on the ramp of Auschwitz in the selection process, the two little boys whose bewildered faces remind me of my own, and whose uniform they wear, I had as six years old. I have a picture of it, and I provided that to the museum to show that this was a uniform which little Hungarian boys, whether they were Jewish or not, wore. And so I am always very moved by their faces, and think of me, that I could be one of them. They of course, not survived and I did. And that is a very emotional thing, but for me \u2014 and a lot of people always wonder, how could I be a survivor and \u2014 and go through that \u2014 that exhibit so many times, isn\u2019t that stressful?

We did not focus at this, we had day \u2014 daily problems and concerns. The memory, as fresh as it 1s 53 years later, was somehow buried for many, many decades, without losing its vividity, its \u2014 its vividness, its \u2014 its \u2014 its relevance. And it stayed there. I mean, it obviously this kind of things don\u2019t go away forever, but I never resisted it consciously, I si \u2014 I simply just went somewhere else. I \u2014 I did \u2014 and I \u2014 I must say also that my life is not defined by the Holocaust. Maybe in the later, last few years it\u2019s focusing \u2014 the Holocaust is more of a focus. But as you heard it from my post- Holocaust experiences and my \u2014 my professional life, I was not \u2014 the fofo \u2014 the Holocaust did not deter me in what I was doing. I was among the probably few who ended up not in a helping profession. You would be a-amazed how many of the survivors ended up in a helping profession, or ha \u2014 how many ended up in becoming a\u2014 more lawyers and doctors, and how few are engineers.

But if my theory turns out to be incorrect, the Americans will say I\u2019m German and the Germans will say I\u2019m Jewish. So the same way with me, it\u2019s \u2014 I feel that the components are there. I am a part \u2014 I have 22 years of me with Hungarian. I have 40 years of me with American and I have 63 years of me with Jewish, and they somehow counteract and interact. I \u2014 I think it is \u2014 is sort of a very simp-simplified question when one asks, who, what is, in what component. I \u2014 I must say, I love Hungarian literature, and I like Hungarian art and music. I love American literature, but I love a lot of \u2014 lot of other things. And my hobbies, for example are more universalist than either Hungarian, American or Jewish. But I lo \u2014 but there are components of all three, which I love, and then there are things which are associated with neither. For example, I \u2014 I love photography, which is neither Jewish \u2014 although there were many Jewish photographers. Neither Jewish nor Hungarian were \u2014 there were a lot of good Hungarian photographers. Nor American, where again, same \u2014 same thing happens.

I believe that the vast majority of the teachers and certainly the students, who will be teaching Holocaust studies and who will be learning Holocaust studies would be Christian. I had had very uneasy few hours, few days in the museum about anti-Semitism. And this is specifically in the Belfer conference this year, where I was \u2014 where I am \u2014 was looking at the struggle of non-Jewish teachers, trying to teach non-Jewish teachers about the central \u2014 centrality of anti-Semitism and church anti-Semitism in the Holocaust. And the difficulties which these teachers had with the acceptance of this idea. And I was very concerned because I feel that if these teachers would simply ignore this, you know, wa \u2014 one of the \u2014 one of the teachers said well, what happens if e \u2014 we teach it different? And he says, well, you have a moral obligation to teach it this way. Well, that\u2019s nice. I always believe in moral obligations, but I heard of very spec \u2014 spe-specific and fairly practical objections. For example one black teacher got up \u2014 very few black teachers participated in this, said hey, I came from Tennessee from the Bible Belt. I cannot teach the Baptists that their belt \u2014 their \u2014 their New Testament is wrong. I can\u2019t teach that, you know, I mean if the Jews are right, then they are wrong. How do I do this? And I was really concerned and I am \u2014 [| think that this 1s a great central concern and should be of the education department to \u2014 to teach the Holocaust and the centrality of the a \u2014 of \u2014 of the anti-Semitism in such a way that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I\u2019m not talking sugarcoating. I am talking truth, or I am talking about acceptable ways, so they can teach it. If you teach it without acceptable ways, then it won\u2019t be taught. And if it is not taught, then the great point of the Holocaust, the great cause of the Holocaust is going to be lost. It\u2019s not enough to teach what happened, they must teach why it happened. And they cannot shirk from the fact that it largely happened because of the centuries of art \u2014 of anti- Semitism. But how do you package it, how do you do this so that the teachers can teach it and can accept it themselves? I talked to teachers afterwards, they really are struggling. I mean, they \u2014 they hear their own priests, they have their own beliefs, and then they hear this, and they don\u2019t know how to resolve it. I think this needs to be really considered and reconsidered in the museum, and that\u2019s not a small amount of work either. That\u2019s my parting shot for this."
