We lived over there for awhile until my mother gave birth to my sister and I guess the apartment became too small and we moved to Moronovska 2 (?), and 1 we lived there even while the ghetto started to be built. The Wall, which happened to have been on the corner."

            "answer": "Very small rooms, but they were like two small bedrooms, a living room and another little room where my parents worked. They used to do ladies lingerie, like piecework. They used to bring it home every morning and work until late at night, and if they finished making the lingerie they would fold it up, put it in boxes and deliver them to a certain place where I suppose they paid them rather well. Because from what I can recall now, that couldn\u2019t have been a very cheap apartment. It was a brand new building when we moved in, it was a corner building, we were on the fourth floor and everyone had a window, so I remember it being a lovely apartment."

They just put them together, folded them up and put them in the boxes and delivered them back to the places. I suppose a factory or a warehouse and they, on the other hand, would sell it to the stores who sold it to clients."

I do not recollect any specifics except for some minute little things, I guess it must have been maybe like Chanukah I would receive some gifts and I was told it was a Jewish holiday, and I was told also there was a holiday, of course now I realize it was Passover, where we couldn\u2019t eat bread. But, I didn\u2019t remember it too well. I remember eating something else beside bread. So this is all I have a recollection of actual holidays."

His Jewish name was Israel. I remember this mostly as Srulik I remember my mother calling his names. That\u2019s why this name was more outstanding than whatever else other people called him. And his sisters in Israel also when they talked about him it\u2019s always Srulik. That\u2019s how he was known. I guess it\u2019s an abbreviation of Israel."

We used to sit, he used to teach me how to read and write and I used to have to spend a certain amount of time everyday looking, if it was an old book, or if 1t was just a page from something, whatever was readable material he made sure that I know how to read and write."

She did not allow me to speak Polish in this country. She did not know too well English, which I caught on within one year. I spoke English when I came here, and for her it was more difficult and she used to speak Yiddish most of the 3 time to all her friends and I guess in no time I learned the language and she would talk to me in Yiddish and I would answer back in English or half Polish until after awhile I learned the language well."

It must have been a special occasion and I think I wasn\u2019t more maybe than three or four years old. It must have been my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding when I saw him, was the only time I saw him. My grandmother died after she gave birth to my mother\u2019s youngest brother, and my father\u2019s side, I don\u2019t remember a grandfather at all, but I do remember a grandmother, my father\u2019s mother living around the corner from us when we lived on Moronovska (?). It was walking distance, but the woman was paralyzed. She lived there with my father\u2019s oldest brother. His name was Shlamik (?), and she was in the last bedroom and I remember my father said every week we have to go and see grandma. So that\u2019s , I remember just seeing her being ill in bed.

Since one of my mother\u2019s sisters had a booth in a market, I guess it was like a flea market at that time. Like an indoor flea market and she had a booth. She would sell toys so she used to bring me certain things I would play with and she told me not to break them because they would be resold tomorrow. Naturally I could never keep anything, but I played with a lot of things and then she would carefully put them back in boxes and sold them."

There were so many people in the streets at that time, they had to move from other areas to move to another area where we were all like closed in. It\u2019s like 1f you have people scattered all over they took a certain section and they made you move there. You had to find a room where to stay. People usually stayed with relatives. This did not last very long because the starvation came in very soon after the water, gas and electricity was shut off, food was shut off. No newspapers, no radios and starvation came in very fast. I remember every morning I looked out my window I saw dead people downstairs. They used to come around with wagons and pick them up."

And everybody used to hide and run away, escape. They would hit people as would drive by or run over people. And I remember them as my instinct told me this very cruel people, they are. And it\u2019s best to hide and not show your face. I understood that immediately. Even though I saw my parents talking quietly to each other, I suppose they were thinking what to do, where to get the next bite of food, but I saw them worried and I realized what it was. 6"

And a lot of people were captured. I remember seeing children dying and begging for food. I also remember my father taking me to a woman who myself and four other little girls we used to be taught how to read and write. So he used to take us, maybe once or twice a week, in the evening, walk over and take another little girl, I don\u2019t know who she was, maybe she was a neighbor, and take us to this woman who used to teach us how to read and write for about, this went on for six months. I would say I was being taught to read and write for the first six months maybe. And even that stopped because I was beaten up once in the street. I was wearing a little jacket and somebody wanted my jacket so they ripped my jacket off and they hit me and I came home bleeding and this was the end of my education, I guess."

And she was only like maybe about a block away, I remember it was only about a five minute walk. So that\u2019s the reason why my father would take me or pick me up or I would walk back.

But this took a while until she went out on the Polish side and she was in contact with the other Poles about papers. She got alien papers that she was not Polish, she was 10 Ukrainian. Those were the papers she was given and her name was Ana Gregorief (?). I will never forget that because she spoke Russian. She did not come from Warsaw so her Polish had a very bad accent. And, therefore, to make sure she is not questioned about being Jewish, she became Ukrainian. Then it\u2019s OK to have an accent. So she became Ana Gregorief and paid a fortune for these papers and as Ana Gregorief she got the job in the ghetto so she could go in and go out and she would bring in food."

All I know I was so happy looking and staring at my mother\u2019s face, I couldn\u2019t believe that she was there and then we drove for about fifteen minutes to another building where I had to sit in the car and she brought my sister down all wrapped up in a blanket and it seemed like they were starving my sister because she looked terrible. She was all swollen with no clothes on, frozen and it was very cold and my mother wrapped her up in the blanket and came running down angrily what they had done to her child in those few months only."

So, I remember going on a trolley and her daughter went with me and we went upstairs and I only had five minutes and I remember my sister laying over there in bed and Mrs. Doblinkov gave a piece of salami and a piece of bread to give it to my sister. So when I came in I gave this to her and she was very cold and the woman was standing there and watching. I gave her the food and she hid it under the blanket and I stood there helpless not knowing what to do. I saw that she was dying, that she was starving and there was nothing I could do about it. And the woman said, OK., your time is up you got to leave. I said I just want to sit with my sister a little more. No, she said, you have to go. Lady, I said, I want to be with her. She said no, leave and I had to leave. I left her the food and when I came back to Mrs. Doblinkov she asked about my sister. I said she is very, very hungry. I\u2019ve known children that look like her they usually die right after that. She said there\u2019s nothing I can do about it, I cannot help her. 17"

But this took awhile, because they were on the lookout. They knew that whoever survived this uprising would want to escape because there was nothing else left there. It was a handful of heroic people and they\u2019re not ready to give up. So even the sewers you couldn\u2019t go, it was all gas there. They would have gotten poisoned.

            "question": "Did your mother survive and escape by herself or was she with others?",
            "answer": "No, I think they could not go in groups. Everybody went their own way, because in a group it is more dangerous. Singularly it always easier to escape when a single person runs. I don\u2019t know, maybe they started as a group and they wound up individually, I don\u2019t know. She never talked about that particular incident. It was a very painful incident in her life. Very painful. And even though she used to talk about a lot of things, she used to remind us when we were in the small ghetto, at one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sister and I were gone and my father was gone. It seems like the Germans came, they were coming and they said we\u2019re going to put the building on fire whoever\u2019s there doesn\u2019t run away or doesn\u2019t give themselves up they\u2019re going to get burned alive. So I don\u2019t know how it happened, how my sister and I somehow or other my father, where was my father, I\u2019m trying to think, he was also gone in the morning. He did not go to work, but my mother went to work and he went someplace and my sister and I were left alone. And when the Germans came, we looked at each other, what are we going to do, we got to run away someplace. So, we went downstairs to the cellar and from the cellar we found there was a hole in the wall there to go to the next building and the next building, so we escaped through a few other buildings. They were also empty, so we didn\u2019t know what had happened to the building we were originally. I don\u2019t know if they put it on fire or they didn\u2019t put it. But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another 21 building and the first thing we started doing is running from apartment to apartment which was all abandoned and there was no food nowhere. We turned quietly every drawer and every closet, we looked all over and then we hear Germans marching downstairs and they\u2019re entering the building and here\u2019s my sister and I alone in this apartment and it\u2019s all empty. I remember I took her and I put her inside a cabinet, a kitchen cabinet. I pushed her inside the kitchen cabinet and I put a blanket on top of her and I closed the cabinet and I hid behind a chest that stood like on a corner, it was some kind of corner chest. I squished in the back of that chest and covered myself also with a blanket so if they even look in they\u2019 ll think there are rags there. And I took a blanket and covered myself and the two of us stayed there. We heard the German footsteps and we heard them getting closer and closer and then they kicked open the door and they marched in this apartment. They must have been looking for Jews from apartment to apartment. This was their preoccupation and that\u2019s how I know this, and they walked in and they machine gunned with the machine guns. They were shooting in every apartment. All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting. I guess in a way they were afraid also maybe somebody was going to attack them or something. So they would come in with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I heard them talking loud and clear I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying. Then I heard them walk out. And when they walked out and they left the door, my first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister\u2019s name, are you alive? She says Yes, are you alive? I said yes. So we got together again, she came out of the cabinet and we decided we\u2019re going to hide in the attic. From now on it was no good in the apartment because they are shooting and they may shoot us. So we\u2019ll go in the attic. We go all the way up in the attic and there\u2019s a lot of furniture and we hear voices. So we realize, because we were very quiet, we knew there were people hidden in the attic. We started moving the furniture away and the people outside didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. And I said, we were yelling in Polish, let us in, let us in, we got to hide with you. So my sister said, well, I\u2019m going to cry so loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I\u2019m going to tell them that you\u2019re hiding there, so let us in there. We came in over there, we sat with them, they had water, so we drank a little water with them."

At the door or there was a window, some kind of exit even if we were locked in we would be able to get out, because my mother said I have a feeling they\u2019re going to do something to us. They\u2019re going to, she thought they\u2019re going to put the poison gas and they\u2019re going to poison everybody there. We didn\u2019t know they were going to put it on fire. So we just broke through the glass and people started panicking. They were breaking all the like stained glass, whatever there was there. People started climbing from the windows and running and jumping into the flames and we ran. At that point we ran with the fire on both sides. My mother grabbed me and my sister. I don\u2019t remember how far, I was like in a daze, we just ran until finally it was a clearance and all the people that came out into a clearance, the Germans were there and there was a train and we all were pointed to get on the train and my mother saw a train and she was like petrified. She says oh, my G-d, we\u2019re going to a concentration camp. She already knew at that point that all trains were going only in one direction. But it did not go to a concentration camp, it went to another camp, some kind of camp, a detention camp where as Poles we were held over there, but there were not like guards, they gave us to eat, they gave us cots to sleep on and we had like a army blanket even to cover ourselves and I remember that my mother said, this is no good, I don\u2019t like this business here, you know, with the Poles they\u2019re going to do something with them also. It\u2019s mostly women and children here. The men, they were shooting them like dogs. And we escaped. We were not there very long, we escaped."

We\u2019ll go there and when we made it over there, we stayed with them, I think for about two nights, and we heard the Germans outside so we ran out to the back, the three of us escaped. And we were on the run continuously on the run until I don\u2019t know for how long on foot until we came to this primitive little village where only farms, like small little straw roof type of little huts. People lived like that and we were all very ragged, and my mother marched into these houses, claiming some kind of accident, something happened and we needed refuge for just a few days. And when they asked us where we come from. We said we come from Warsaw. She said, oh, she heard about Warsaw, can you tell 25 us stories about it. She says if you let me sleep here, I'll tell you all the stories you want to know. They heard about wagons going on electric. This was all primitive, and when I think back, my G-d like a few hundred years behind times."

Well after awhile we found a Jewish Russian soldier who was a Jew. He was very nice. As the Russians came in and the war is over, and they said they are chasing the Germans are just in front of them and they were passing with tanks which were so loud and we packed up our few little belongings and they did not mind taking us, jumping in the truck and taking us along, a part of a truck and part we sat on a tank. Just to get out of this village, and we wanted to go to any town and as we were going through on these vehicles we saw the Germans hanging from trees. Which was some sight to see."

When we came into one of the cities, we passed by a city, I don\u2019t even know what big city we passed by, she went to a hospital. I was there sitting and they told her they have to treat her for a few days. And I didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her.

She got well after a few days and I remember she became very calm. She was not as wild as she was during the war. She would do crazy things. She would jump, and run, and lift and pick. But here after she got sick, we were released, I guess from the German agony, I guess you never thought the end was going to come.

It seemed like there was a palace over there and everybody lived over there. It was like they took over something and we lived there. There were like a hundred children for a very short time, and we were supposed to be, I suppose they must have advised my mother to bring us there for a few months to retrain our thoughts to make us aware that the war was over, which I refused to believe. Although I saw signs of the war being over, but I still did not believe, I thought that the Germans would spring out from someplace, make a surprise. I didn\u2019t trust anybody anymore. I did not believe anybody anymore. I didn\u2019t want to get close to anybody. They tried, they worked on me very, very hard, until I took the cross off, it took awhile 30 and I think what influenced me the most was when I met from Israel in the camp, there were some young Israeli, all though there was no Israel at that time, it was Palestine, but they came in some kind of uniforms from the kibbutz, maybe, or whatever. They were dressed with the berets and I was so impressed when I looked at them and they said, you see they are just like you, they are also Jews. And these are young soldiers and this, I think, I fell in love with them the minute I saw them. It was almost like all of a sudden I discovered something, a goal, something different to leave my past and this is the future to go to Israel and to be just like them. And I wanted very much to be just like them and this is where I realized I\u2019m not Polish I\u2019m going to go to Israel and I\u2019m going to find a new enemy called Arabs."

Everybody was missing five years of school, so you had children from all ages. There were also children that were born in concentration camps, there were children that were orphaned, they were taken away from Polish people. I met a lot of people in , also in that camp where we stayed right after the war when we came to Warsaw after the war when we stayed in this camp. I also met some people from all over and the majority were staying with other families. That\u2019s how they survived and it seems like the families, some kids escaped, some of them were older already. Some of them at that time were like 17 or 18 years old. They must have run away when the war was over and they came voluntarily to this place to find themselves to know who they are. Some, maybe the families, the Polish families, brought them, I don\u2019t know. But they were like dumped. Before you know it within a few weeks more than a hundred children there.
