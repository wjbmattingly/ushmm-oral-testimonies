This did not last very long because the starvation came in very soon after the water, gas and electricity was shut off, food was shut off. No newspapers, no radios and starvation came in very fast.

And it\u2122s best to hide and not show your face. I understood that immediately. Even though I saw my parents talking quietly to each other, I suppose they were thinking what to do, where to get the next bite of food, but I saw them worried and I realized what it was. 7"

Those were the papers she was given and her name was Ana Gregorief (?). I will never forget that because she spoke Russian. She did not come from Warsaw so her Polish had a ve ry bad accent. And, therefore, to make sure she is not questioned about being Jewish, she became Ukrainian. Then it\u2122s OK to have an accent.

They had to be at a hideout for quite some time until they could get out from wherever they were hiding until it became clearer that she could get out of there. But this took awhile, because they were on the lookout. They knew that whoever survived this uprising would want to escape because there was nothing el se left there. It was a handful of heroic people and they\u2122re not ready to give up. So even the sewers you couldn\u2122t go, it was all gas there. They would have gotten poisoned. So they had to wait probably until it was o.k. to find a way to leave."

            "answer": "No, I think they could not go in gro ups. Everybody went their own way, because in a group it is more dangerous. Singular ly it always easier to escape when a single person runs. I don\u2122t know, maybe they started as a group and they wound up individually, I don\u2122t know. She never talked about that particular incident. It was a very painful incident in her life. Very painful. And even though she used to talk about a lot of things, she used to remind us when we were in the small ghetto, at one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sister and I were gone and my father was gone. It seems like the Germans came, they were coming and they said we\u2122re going to put the building on fire whoever\u2122s there doesn\u2122t run away or doesn\u2122t give themselv es up they\u2122re going to get burned alive. So I don\u2122t know how it happened, how my sister and I somehow or other my father, where was my father, I\u2122m trying to think, he was also gone in the morning. He did not go to work, but my mother we nt to work and he went someplace and my sister and I were left alone. And when the German s came, we looked at each other, what are we going to do, we got to run away someplace. So, we went downstairs to the cellar and from the cellar we found there was a hole in the wall there to go to the next building and the next building, so we escaped through a few other buildings. They were also empty, so we didn\u2122t know what had happened to the building we were originally. I don\u2122t know if they put it on fire or they didn\u2122t put it. But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another 22building and the first thing we started doing is running from apartment to apartment which was all abandoned and th ere was no food nowhere. We turned quietly every drawer and every closet, we looked all over and then we hear Germans marching downstairs and they\u2122r e entering the building and here\u2122s my sister and I alone in this apartment and it\u2122s all empty. I remember I took her and I put her inside a cabinet, a kitchen cabinet. I pushed her inside the kitchen cabinet and I put a blanket on top of her and I closed the cabinet and I hid behind a chest that stood like on a corner, it was some kind of corner chest. I squished in the back of that chest and covered myself also with a blanket so if they even look in they\u2122ll think there are rags there. And I took a blanket and covered myself and the two of us stayed there. We heard the German footsteps and we heard them getting closer and closer and then they kicked open the door and they marched in this apartment. They must have been looking for Jews from apartment to apartment. This was their preoccupati on and that\u2122s how I know this, and they walked in and they machine gunned with the machine guns. They were shooting in every apartment. All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting. I guess in a way they were afraid also maybe somebody was going to attack them or something. So they would come in with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I heard them talking loud and clear I didn\u2122 t understand what they were saying. Then I heard them walk out. And when they walked out and they left the door, my first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister\u2122s name, are you alive? She says Yes, are you alive? I said yes. So we got together again, she came out of the cabinet and we decided we\u2122re going to hide in the attic. From now on it was no good in the apartment because they are shooting a nd they may shoot us . So we\u2122ll go in the attic. We go all the way up in the attic and there\u2122s a lot of furniture and we hear voices. So we realize, because we were very quiet, we knew there were people hidden in the attic. We starte d moving the furniture away and the people outside didn\u2122t know what\u2122s going on. And I said, we were yelling in Polish, let us in, let us in, we got to hide with you. So my sister said, well, I\u2122m going to cry so loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I\u2122m going to tell them that you\u2122re hiding there, so let us in there. We came in over there, we sat with them, they had water, so we drank a little water with them."

We stayed w ith them for a few days and then we left them, and we were going from building to building, we got to find our parents, where are our parents, we had no idea.

When we came into one of the cities, we passed by a city, I don\u2122t even know what big city we passed by, she went to a hospital. I was there sitting and they told her they have to treat her for a few days. And I didn\u2122t know what was wrong with her. But I remember my sister and I sitting and waiting for her to get well, because we couldn\u2122t go anyplace without her. This was it, you know. She got well after a few days and I remember she became very calm. She was not as wild as she was during the war. She would do crazy things. She would jump, and run, and lift and pick. But here after she got sick, we were released, I guess from the German agony, I guess you never thought the end was going to come. Every day was a year, you\u2122re talking about five long miserable years, miserable years."

It seemed like there was a palace over there and everybody lived over there. It was like they took over something and we lived there. There were like a hundred children for a very short time, and we were supposed to be, I suppose they must have advised my mother to bring us there for a few m onths to retrain our thoughts to make us aware that the war was over, which I refused to believe. Although I saw signs of the war being over, but I still did not believe, I thought that the Germans would spring out from someplace, make a surpri se. I didn\u2122t trust anybody anymore. I did not believe anybody anymore. I didn\u2122t want to get close to anybody. They tried, they worked on me very, very hard, until I took the cross off, it took awhile 31and I think what influenced me the most was when I met from Israel in the camp, there were some young Israeli, all though th ere was no Israel at that time, it was Palestine, but they came in some kind of uniforms from the kibbutz, maybe, or whatever. They were dressed with the berets and I was so impressed when I looked at them and they said, you see they are just like you, they are also Jews. And these are young soldiers and this, I think, I fell in love with them the minute I saw them. It was almost like all of a sudden I discovered something, a goal, something different to leave my past and this is the future to go to Israel and to be just like them. And I wanted very much to be just like them and this is where I realized I\u2122m not Polish I\u2122m going to go to Israel and I\u2122m going to find a new enemy called Arabs."

Everybody was missing five y ears of school, so you had children from all ages.

I met a lot of people in _____, al so in that camp where we stayed right after the war when we came to Warsaw after the war wh en we stayed in this camp. I also met some people from all over and the majority were staying with other families. That\u2122s how they survived and it seems like the families, some kids escaped, some of them were older already. Some of th em at that time were like 17 or 18 years old. They must have run away when the war was over and they came voluntarily to this place to find themselves to know who they are. Some, maybe the families, the Polish families, brought them, I don\u2122t know. But they were like dumped. Before you know it within a few weeks more than a hundred children there. So they brought all these psychologists, people talking to us and retraining us, trying to make us forget the war in a way and to think that there is another life now is going to start.
