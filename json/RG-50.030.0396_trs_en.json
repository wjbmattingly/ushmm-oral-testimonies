            "question": "Can you tell us about your family \u0152 your fa ther, your mother, what they were like, what they did, and then about you and your two sisters?",
            "answer": "We were growing up in a small town, population about 35-40,000, and it was \u0152 I would say that the Jewish population amounted to ap proximately ten percent, no more, due to the fact that there were large factories in the city, in the town, which were government \u0152 belonged to the government, and the people who were employed in those factories \u0152 they were manufacturing ammunitions, and also they had foundries and iron ore mines \u0152 People who were employed in the factories were mostly Christian people, gentile people. Jews were involved in predominately business and they were artisans and craftsmen, and this was more or less the composition of th e town. The town \u0152 the Jewish population in town was very well organized. We had a lot of different organizations. And I as a child could only get more or less from the conve rsation that I overheard at home, you know, about my parents being involved in the co mmunity going to different meetings. They were predominately involved with Zionist organizations. They were not orthodox or religious people, but they were traditional Jews. My parents had a kosher home and I would say that we observed the main holidays. I don\u2122t think that my father was going to synagogue every day. I know he didn\u2122t. And as far as we were concerned, as youngsters, 2 as soon as we were old enough, we too joined Zionist youth groups because this was sort of saying the whole idea that eventually we will all ma ke our way to Palestine. As far as my parents are concerned, they were very active in the community \u0152 Mother in particular, more so, because Father was a lot away from home. Father\u2122s involvement in the community never was as involved as was my mother\u2122s. He was what they call \u0152 I don\u2122t know the name, there is no equivalent in the English language \u0152 but it is Braka. What this \u0152 what he has \u0152 what he did, he was evaluating\u2013 How to say it? Actually he was an appraiser of large tracts of forest because he was representing a very large international companies that supplied timber to German co mpanies and British companies. They used the timber for support in mines. So, he was working for a company like this, and before the companies went into the negotiation of th e purchase of the timber, they had to have an idea more or less of what \u0152 how many trees they are, what it will yield, and so forth, because they had to pay tremendous amounts of money. So, my father\u2122s job was to travel to the forests and, in most cases, with the as sistant of the forester, they went into the woods and he was estimating, more or less, you know, how many trees there are on the tract, how thick they are, what the yield would be, and when he was coming home from the trip, he used to sit and prepare specifi cations, and on the basis of his specifications, the companies went into the negotiations fo r the purchase. So, he wasn\u2122t that much around because usually once he went away, it was like three to four, sometimes five weeks before he\u2122d return home, and when he\u2122d return home he used to sit, you know, for hours and hours and hours in his study preparing, you know, the specifications. So, Mother was certainly in charge of the household and the children and seeing to our comfort and overseeing our activities and education and she was a wonderful woman, and really, as far as forming the character, it was Mother\u2122s responsibility. And, to her, education was very, very important. So, outside of the fact that sh e was very involved with community and the Zionist organizati on, she formed the WIZO in Starachowice. She was the first president in the WIZO or ganization. She was a me mber of regional and the national \u0152 no, what\u2122s the word I want to use? \u0152 she was a member of the regional\u2013uh\u2013"

So, every once in a while, you know, when I wanted to know a little bit more about my parents immediately after the war, I used to turn to those people who \u0152 the generation between my parents and my self that could tell me a little bit more about who my parents were. Because basically, you know, to a child a parent is a parent. You don\u2122t think of them as individuals. You just think of them as parents, and they\u2122re there to take care of you and provide for you and make you comfortabl e whenever it\u2122s necessary. So, with the conversation \u0152 in conversations with those people, I found out a lot about my parents and especially from women who were like eight, ten years older then myself who were, you know, already teenagers or a little older who told me how wonderful my mother was and how energetic she was and how inspiring she was in, some would say, in bringing the Zionist idea and inspiring people and so forth and so on. 3"

            "num": 8,
            "question": "Other than his working so hard.",
            "answer": "No, Father was a disciplinarian. He was the head of the family, a typical European head of the family. He was a disciplinarian a nd a no-nonsense man. And he was outgoing and he was very nice, but still in all, you know, when he spent time with us, I would say that, if you were to compare with present days, you would say it was more quality time rather than otherwise. And, Father was \u0152 had a beautiful singing voice. He was, he was born in Silesia, which at the time when he was born, it was German occupied part of Poland that was occupied by Germany. So, I would say at th e turn of the century, 1900, that was, his \u0152 his world was Vienna, 1900. So, the musi c, you know, by Strauss and Mahler and Leh\u00e1r \u0152 that was his world. He loved music. He had a beautiful singing voice. So, when we get together, I remember how we used to \u0152 first of all, the taste for classical music I got from my father \u0152 and we have been lis tening to his singing, and we sang along with him. I mean, even in German, because his education was a German education. So, he spoke more, as far as foreign languages, he used more German then any other language. And so, he sang along with us, and he was teach ing us voices in order to sing in different voices so that we could sing in harmony. And, no matter where we went afterwards, when we were in a crowd, they knew that th e three of us could sing in harmony. So, we were always asked to sing any song, you know , and because we have learned what it takes to sing in harmony, we could ourselves , later on, adapt to certain levels, whereby we could create, even though not knowing whether we are doing it right or wrong, we could sing in harmony one way or another, you know, in different voices. So, this was very interesting. But, Father\u2122s culture, basically, the culture of experience, was more German. As a matter of fact, he had a st udy with a huge mahogany desk, and behind the desk was like a secretary behind glass doors. He was a very neat man, very neat, very elegant gentleman. I\u2122m sorry I don\u2122t have the picture right now here. And, he used to have everything placed all orderly including the huge German encyclopedia. I remember when I went to high school and I took German as the second language, he used to say to me, \ufb01If you ever need to use the encyclopedi a, you are welcome to it, but don\u2122t bend the pages, and please make sure that everything is placed back where it belongs.\ufb02 So, you know, this is the kind of a person he was. He was a very orderly person with whom, you know, things had to be always right. But I really developed a very close relationship with my father after we had been taken to camp, when we lost our mother, because it just happened so that we had been working togeth er, and we had access to one another. It was the slave labor camp in Starachowice, where we were not separated all the time and we could have meals together and so forth and so on. It was at that time that I really realized what a caring and loving person he was, a nd inasmuch as he didn\u2122t have maybe the 4 patience when we were little to be with us. This was the bonding sort of time when I really felt how important he wa s in our lives, and how important we were in his life. So, these are more or less, you know, the way I would think of my parents."

        {
            "num": 9,
            "question": "Tell me a little bit more about your mother . Was she very warm? Was she not so neat, given that she had to take care of all of you? That she was a little different then your father? Or was she\u2013?",
            "answer": "Mother was, I would say, the extreme opposit e of my father. She was \u0152 first of all, she was more of a people\u2122s person. She loved to be with people. She was the person who organized all social events. She was the person who was entertaining. She was the person who welcomed everybody in the house, regardless of who they were. Poor, I remember days when the local people who were destitute were coming to my mother asking for assistance, not only Jews but gentiles. It is a family \u0152 there was a family, I mean, nobody is alive anymore \u0152 a Christian family that came to settle in Starac howice at the time when the revolution in Russia broke out. They used to live in Belarus, if I remember correctly, and they came to our town. They happened to be living in the same courtyard, you know, how Europeans cities where it wasn\u2122t individual homes, but it was like one house and there was a courtyard and in the courtyard were other houses and people lived all around. And, they were intelligent, very nice, wonderful people, parents and four women who were more or less the age of my parents, a little younger. And Mother got to like them. And it was very difficult for them to get, some would say, accustomed. to go to town and to make a living and so forth and so on. So, Mo ther has encouraged them to open a, like, a kinder care. I was three years old when I was already in that pre-nursery, nursery whatever you call it, with my sister, you know , my older sister, and of course, Mother had seen to it that other \u0152 that friends of hers would send their children. So, it gave them immediately a little bit, kind of a source of income in addition to the father who was, he was not a doctor, he was a medic, that Mr. Pa liszewski. He was working as a medic in the Russian Army, I think, or whatever. He was so knowledgeable about medicine that eventually when the hospital opened in our town, he was an accredited practitioner in the hospital without being a doctor. So, this tells you something, but you know it takes time for any newcomer. So, my mother was doi ng all these things, and by the way, the Paliszewski family the most wonderful family to us. I mean, for us, they were a home away from home all the time. And I\u2122m skipping things, but I must tell you that after the war, when I came back to my home town, if it wasn\u2122t for them, I would have been killed the day I arrived back. But this is another story. So, I cherished the friendship that my parents had with the Paliszewski family. So, here we are, we were talking about my mother, what she was doing. So, she was trying to assist destitute people. She was trying to help people who were coming to the comm unity to kind of get settled and start a new life. She was, during the war \u0152 she was instrumental in creating the Hebrew school to which we went, a Hebrew Day School. My first four years of formal schooling were not in the public school system, but they were in the Hebrew schools, in the Hebrew school. Everything in that school was in Hebrew \u0152 math, geography \u0152 everything they taught us was in Hebrew. I mean, we were learning Polish as well, but Polish was a language \u0152 5 Polish history and Polish was taught in Polish. Everything else was taught in Hebrew. Now, I want you to know that in our home , we never spoke Yiddish, which was a language that was used in everybody\u2122s house. My parents both were educated. They spoke four languages fluently \u0152 Polish, and German, and Russian, because Father was educated in German schools, Mother was e ducated in Russian schools, and Yiddish, of course, they spoke fluently. Sometimes they s poke Yiddish so that if they wanted to say something we shouldn\u2122t understand. Mother come s from a family that was, I would say, very educated due to the fact that even my grandma, I remember Grandma Sara, had a high school diploma, and I want you to know that in those days, nobody considered an education for a woman necessary. She had thirteen children, mi nd you. Nine survived; four died either in childbirth or whatever it was. That was \u0152 she married \u0152 she comes from a family of bankers, Fefers, from Ostoriwiec and she married a man who was come from Sandomierz. He was in the printing business. So, again, in order to be in the printing business, you had to be very literate, b ecause otherwise you could not run a successful printing business. That was my mother\u2122s side of the family. All my aunts are \u0152 graduated from high school. The youngest one went to the university and she became a pharmacist, and she worked, I think it was the year before the war; it was her first year of employment. She was the youngest, you know, and th at was her first year of employment and she was somewhere near Bialystok, and we never found out what happened to her. We thought that maybe, because she was so clos e to the territory that it was eventually occupied by the Russians \u0152 you know, in 1939, when Poland was divided between the German occupants and the Russian occupants \u0152 but we couldn\u2122t find her. So, out of the family of nine on my mother\u2122s side, there was a set of three sisters, first. They all had children. My mother is the last one from the fi rst set of three girls. They have children who have married with children already. Like my oldest aunt had tw o sons who had been married before the war, and they already had little babies. One of them had two, and one of them had one, while the youngest sister was just graduated from the university. And in the middle were three brothers who at the tim e of the Russian revolution made their way to the United States and Canada. So, there were the first three women in the family, then there were the three men in the family, and th ere were the three youngest girls, sisters of my mother\u2122s, in the family, who were still single. One of them got married right \u0152 I would say during the war, maybe in 1940s, and I don\u2122t remember whether she had a family or not. I just can\u2122t reca ll that, and this is it. So, I wa s very fortunate to have some members of my mother\u2122s family here in the Un ited States and in Canada that, at least, you know, makes you feel good that there is somebody around who can tell you who you are, when you were, and what was life like for them when they were around. Another interesting thing about my parents, if you want to know, is I mentioned to you before that they were very instrumental, always trying to assist other people. I remember, you know, whoever, as I said before, whoever knocked on the door, they were always, always more than willing to help, but beggars came around, you know, they used to give me like a coin and said, \ufb01Go out and give it to them.\ufb02 They were never asked to come in. And there were many people who were coming begging, y ou know, in those days. But then in 1937 maybe \u212238, I was a little older, there was \u0152 I could see new faces that were coming in and they spoke German, and when my parents \u0152 my parents used to say that if they are not 6 home and there is somebody who is coming in and doesn\u2122t speak Polish but speaks German, be sure to ask them to come in. Those were the German Jews who were being so-called \ufb01resettled\ufb02 from the German territ ories. And they, when they were coming to the different communities in Poland, and they just happened to be come to our town, to Starachowice, due to the fact that Fath er was, spoke German so well and could communicate with them and understand their ne eds and Mother was so being having all these contacts and connections being so, so to say, as they say in America, a Macher, you know, trying to be of assistance to others, that I could see, you know, how they really spent a lot of time in order to assist them. And I didn\u2122t understand that much at the time yet, but somebody knocked on the door and they used to say in German \ufb01 Is Herr Laks zu Hause?\ufb02 And I used to run to mom and say, \ufb01Mommy, a Deutsche Jude is there.\ufb02 You know, I remember, I did it once and Mother said , \ufb01I don\u2122t want you to talk like this.\ufb02 If anybody\u2122s asking about dad or about me, ope n the door and ask them in. You know, you are a child, you don\u2122t know what to do. You don\u2122t know how to behave. So, what they did for the people, in what way they assisted them, I don\u2122t know, but the mere fact that I had observed that those people were welcome in our home and that my parents cared to listen to them, I\u2122m sure that they have done something to make their life easier."

            "question": "Were you wealthy? Was the family wealthy or well off in some way?",
            "answer": "Well, let me tell you about this aspect of the family. From the pictures that I have seen in the albums, from the early childhood, I think th at we were quite comfortable because the pictures were from different resorts, areas like the Baltic Sea, you know, and from the mountains, the Bezkidy, and there was a spa in Busko Zdroj that my mother was going, and we always had either the maid or a nanny that came along, you know, to take care of us. But at the time of the depression, when America, you know, after the crash and when Europe was attracted by the American depr ession, which was 1933 or whatever, I don\u2122t remember in Poland at the time, Father\u2122s se rvices were not needed anymore due to the fact that neither Germany nor England could afford to come and purchase timber in Poland because they themselves, you know, they had to make do with whatever they had, and utilize what they had. You know, it was a very, very difficult time. So, I remember Father was looking, I mean, he had to suppor t the family. He stopped going away from home and he was around home base. So, I reme mber he had a job with the same company that he was representing before, but here, too, he had to be channeled into a different aspect of the operation of the lumber company, and there was only part-time work for him. So, he also assumed a kind of a half , semi-position with a credit company because we lived in, as I said before, in an industrial area, and people were buying things on credit, you know. So, let\u2122s say if somebody wanted to buy an item which was expensive, and I\u2122m not talking about thousands of zlotys, but whatever, but they needed a coat or a new suit, and whatever. You know, he couldn\u2122t walk into the store and buy it. So, the man who was on the job in the factories, in the munitions factories, used to go to the store and establish a credit and he was paying so much a month, a week, I have no idea. But Father was doing the research in order to give them the credit reference. So, that was another thing. But we were growing up and we had to go to school, and my older sister in 7 particular was about ready for high school, and that was an expensive thing. So, my mother decided to learn a trade. We had, I mean, things were difficult, so we subletted a room, and we subletted a room in our house to a woman who was a corset maker. And the woman said to my mother, after she wa s half a year in town, she says, \ufb01You know what? You have such connections.\ufb02 You know because she was trying to assist her, \ufb01You have such great connections, and I\u2122m a single wo man, and I don\u2122t think I like to stay here for too long.\ufb02 She says, \ufb01Why don\u2122t you learn it? And why don\u2122t you run a corset shop?\ufb02 So, of course, Mother figured she\u2122s there, so she might as well learn. Mother didn\u2122t know how to use a sewing machine or anything like this. I remember, in the beginning, she used to cry because the wheel was turning the other way around instead of forward. But she has learned and, of course, with all her connections in the community, you know, the non-Jewish and the Jewish population, she developed a wonderful business. She was really, and you know she had the respect of everybody, and therefore, so you know that was another source of income for us, which wa s easier. And then in 1937, finally, Father got back on his feet, and he became a representa tive of a wholesaler from abroad. I don\u2122t know. One company I think was in Lithuania that was sending different cheeses, so it was importing different cheeses from Lithuani a, and canned fish either from Denmark or Holland, I don\u2122t know. So, he had these two franchises that kind of brought him back on his feet and things were looking up, and we were growing up and ready for school and\u2013"

So, when Uncle Moish, when I met him, he always was telling me how Uncle Moish played the banjo and sang. So, he used to tell me how they used to get together and they used to form like the little theater and perform for people in the community, you know, get together and they had other people, you know, who were like themselves kind of artistic and with good si nging voices and everything. So, Uncle Moish was telling, filling me on those little things that were at home as far as singing is concerned. So, they all had this, this musical ea r.

            "answer": "Well, if she needed errands, you know, and if she didn\u2122t want, she was too busy to do what she was supposed to do, like take care of uniform, you know. W e went to school in uniform regardless whether we were in elementary school or in high school. In elementary school, we used to wear like a smock, which was, we called it an apron, you 9 know, with a little white collar, and for it to be fresh we used to change \u0152 like a Peter Pan around, kind of \u0152 for it to be nice and fresh we used to put everyday a fresh collar, you know, lots and lots of collar in a drawer that were always washed and starched. It was a matter of pasting it to the coll ar. My sister she wouldn\u2122t do it . She used to pin it, and it was always crooked. So, she used to have me do those things for her. Like, she was too busy with homework and she was too busy with her so to say, involvement with school and she read books. She read constantly, constantly. I mean, have developed a liking for books and for reading, especially classics, because of her due to the fact that I was the younger one. She was the older one. So, of course, I couldn\u2122t read the same books at the same time as she did, but when she was co ming home from high school and some of her friends came along for a visit, and they were sitting around and talking, discussing books, I used to be so envious that I didn\u2122t know anything about it. So, of course, I was reaching out. How much I have gotten out of the reading at the time, like okay, let me give you a book like Les Mis\u00e9rables. I could understand that b ecause it was about \u0152 from the historical point of view, I could understand. The social nua nces of the book, I don\u2122t think that I understood then as much as I can understand now. Now, if they were, let\u2122s say, if they were discussing The Bauhaus, Ibsen, it was beyond me. And, I took it, and I looked it, and I read it for the fact that I wanted to get acquainted with it, but with how much I had gotten, I don\u2122t remember. I still read Anna Karenina and Tolstoy, you know, and some of it I have gotten. When I sat and listened to the conversations, it kind of made a little more sense. My problem was that I di d not read the book before the discussions. I had read the book after the discussions. So, therefore, I could only apply just so much what I overheard and no more. I mean, and don\u2122t forget that it\u2122s not like right now, I would open a book and it would be quite clear to me, you know? Basically those days were \u0152 what interested me was the story a nd the people involved and the plot. But, in between the lines, how much I have seen there, I don\u2122t think I did."

So, she had to go out of town to a larger city, to Radom. There were private schools in Radom, and there was li ke a federal school in Radom. That was the Gymnasium Chalubinskiego was the number one school in Radom. And in order to get into that school , you had to be a very excellent student. So, when she came \u0152 and they were accepting I don\u2122t remember 25 or 30 students annually \u0152 the school was predominately for local peopl e from the city, and it was a non-Jewish school. So, the number of Jews was limited. You had to go through an exam, entrance exam, regardless of how good a student you were, you still had to have an entrance exam, entry exam? Whatever. So, when Mother br ought her for the exam in Radom, Mother was nervous, not my sister, because Mother knew that she\u2122s not going to pass it. Not only being from out of town, but being Jewish, th ere is no place where she can take her. So, that was like in June, early June and the results were like\u2013"

So, Mother took her for the exam, and a few week s later were the results, and the school was closed already, so what they had is they had like a blackboard on which they posted all the people who had been accepted, not alphabetica lly, but on the basis of how they scored in the exam, and my sister was number five, and accepted. Do you realize that achievement? Now, that was very difficult ti mes for us. That was the time when \u0152 she must have gone in 1935 because I was in hi gh school already in \u212237. When she went to school, financially, my parents weren\u2122t doing so well, and tuition was expensive. Not only that she was accepted to school, but she received a scholarship, a 50 percent reduction in tuition. So, she was really brilliant, and I love her, she\u2122s so special, she\u2122s so special. She\u2122s having health problems now, unfortunately, and she lost her husband. So, it\u2122s difficult for her, very, very difficult. But, she\u2122s a very special person, and I always tried to emulate her, always. I mean, she st ood there and she was reciting poetry. I mean, she was, she was just a very unusual girl. As I told you, she was my role model.

You know, there was \u0152 here it was like the difference in age was two years. There, it\u2122s almo st four, and you know, we were little kids, and she kind of \u0152 I felt that she belongs with the sissies. I wanted to be what my other sister was. So, we kind of treated her like the baby in the family, you know. To play with her, play games and do things, you know, whenever she wants. She always had such a curiosity for things. Renia was an unbelieva ble person. When it came to learning about any little thing, nothing missed he r ear or eye. And also the one thing about Renia was, when she heard a new expression, she put it to use immediately. We used to laugh at her because sometimes she couldn\u2122t say it properly. So, she used the word, but it was kind of, the word that she wanted to use, she kind of changed it around. I don\u2122t mean by changing it around, it\u2122s like, let\u2122s say, a child would say instead of a napkin, they would say \ufb01napik\ufb02 or whatever, you know, this kind of a thing. They will leave out one syllable or whatever because, you know, it\u2122s either difficult for them to say it, or is it because they didn\u2122t hear the exact thing. But every word that was new to her, she used it immediately. What was the word that we used to make so much fun of her? I can\u2122t remember right now. It may come back to me. It was a \u0152 it ha d to do with intellect, and the way she used it was very, very funny. I just don\u2122t rememb er right now. I should\u2122ve asked her."

            "question": "You describe, and when you talk about ever ybody, there\u2122s a kind of security about your household and your family for you. Is that accurate, that sense that you were very grounded in a family that supported you and\u2013? 11",
            "answer": "We were a very close-knit family. Even as much as Father was away, but when he was around, as I said, he was a typical head of the family. He cared, he provided for the family, he did things with the family. But I would say that now that I am a parent and I am a grandparent and I can observe how people be have at certain stages in their life, that I can see that with the exception of the present generation, where both parents are on jobs and are away from home, where both parents are involved in the actual running of the household. In the olden days, the father was not too involved with the children. Maybe if we had boys in the family, it would have been different. I don\u2122t know. I don\u2122t know. I may be wrong. I may be right. You know, maybe there would be a different tie. As a matter of a fact, I didn\u2122t mention it to you, but my parents had four children. The first born was a boy, and he was a very bright boy. He was four years old when my father went on a trip to the East, I mean to \u0152 you know, for the job, how you say on his duties on the job, and he took sick, and Mother received a telegram that Father was sick and he\u2122s in the hospital. So, she left the maid w ith the baby and she told the maid to take the baby, get on the train and go to my gra ndmother\u2122s \u0152 Grandmother lived only 30 kilometers away. So, the maid \u0152 it was wint ertime and the maid dressed the baby up and whatever and it was hot on the train and cold outside. What happened, I don\u2122t know, but the baby got pneumonia and a week later my mo ther got a telegram to come immediately back from my grandma, and by the time she got back the baby was dead. He was the first born who before even my oldest sister was born. So, I could remember seeing in my mother\u2122s purse either fresh grass or wilted grass which must have been from the grave every time she went to the cemetery, but she alwa ys used to carry a little bit of something in her purse. His name was Juziu, Jusef wa s his name. So, now you are asking me about closeness with Father. I don\u2122t know. Remarkable , another thing that\u2122s rather remarkable is that Mother used to say to us when we asked her about him \u0152 we were children so we were curious because there was a picture of a little boy, very pretty boy \u0152 I\u2122m so sorry that I don\u2122t have a picture of him. Little sailor collar, little white shirt and all that. And she used to tell us and then she says that during the First World Wa r I think he was born. No, if my sister was born in \u212224, he must ha ve died in \u212223 or \u212222. It was still wartime. And Mother was with him on a train and he was asking all kinds of questions. He saw the people in uniform and the buttons and the hats and all that, and she used to \u0152 he used to ask all the questions, and there was a woman sitting on the opposite of my mother and she looked at the little boy and she says to my mother, \ufb01T hat boy\u2122s not going to live too long. He\u2122s too smart.\ufb02 And, you know, Mother repeat ed to us when we were a little older and we started to ask more and more questions. It must have been tr agic for her. I mean, she didn\u2122t want to dwell on it, I\u2122m sure, becau se she had the responsibility to her family and it was a very \u0152 it must have been a ve ry painful and sad experience for her to go through with this. So, this is the answer. You know, God giveth and God taketh away, and you never know when."

            "answer": "The only \u0152 the first time really that that I was aware of some thing happening was when the German Jews were arriving, and when they came to our town and, as they were coming every once in a while to our house to vi sit with my parents, who were trying to assist them. So, the reference that I had made before as to always referring to the people as the Deutsche Juden, because in the community the Jews of the community used to refer to the newcomers, to the new Jews from Germany, as the Deutsche Juden, to distinguish between the local Jewish population and the Jews that were coming to town. And, of course, their plight which was kind of obvious because I could see the extent of my parents\u2122 involvement, but at the same time, this was happening in Germany and Germany, in the mind of the young person, is ve ry far away. So, there is no immediate danger inasmuch as to my parents, I\u2122m sure that they could see the whole picture in a different way. To us, we were still at home, we were still at school, we were secure in our environment, and therefore, we didn\u2122t pa y much attention, and it has never been discussed. I\u2122m sure that my parents inasmuch as they could have known or not, would not bring it up at all. We were, I feel, maybe \u0152 I\u2122m sure we were too young to comprehend it, and it was no use of burdening us with additional fears, because you live in a world where antisemitism was quite prevalent and we had enough to deal with the hooligans in town who used to call us \ufb01dirty Jews\ufb02 and throw rocks at you on occasion whenever they could, you know, and I was accepted. I mean, my friends that I went to school with used to refer to me \ufb01theyeste shenasha\ufb02 (ph), as if to say \ufb01You are ours, our own\ufb02 so to say, because I was just like them. You know, I s poke the language in the same manner, and we started together and we worked together on school projects and all that, but nevertheless, on the way to school, we had to pass by the area where the factories were, and they were kind of closed in by a very big fence all around, and for about, I would say, one kilometer, there were no homes but ju st that huge, huge, huge fence. And on that fence there were \u0152 they used whitewash, they called that thing? \u0152 all kinds of sign, anti-Semitic signs. For example, they said, \ufb01 Be zyd\ufb02 (ph) \u0152 not to kill the Jews, but hit the Jew, or there was a sign \ufb01Zyd to Pijawka \ufb02 \u0152 the Jew is a leach, or they used to say, \ufb01Zydy do Palestyny\ufb02 \u0152 Jew, go to Palestine. And, you know, it wasn\u2122t pleasant. I don\u2122t know who has put, you know, all that stuff on the fences, but they were never removed. They were there all the time. But if you live in this type of environment and you expect to see it all the time, you know, on the way to school and on the way home from school, it kind of \u0152 you don\u2122t pay any attention anymore to it.

But you know it was an aggravating kind of a thing, that a twelve year old one or a thirteen year old one, you 14 know, we wouldn\u2122t \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 let me put it this way, that I could understand it better my mother\u2122s desire to plan the eventual immigration to Palestine based on this kind of a situation. This is why she insisted that we learn Hebrew, and this is why she insisted to instill in us the Zionist idea and this is w hy she was helpful in creating a Zionist youth movement, and we joined, and, you know, we di dn\u2122t have leaders in the community, so they used to bring leaders from larger to wns who were coming once a month to kind of give us a definite direction more so from a contemporary point of view rather then be lead by some adult. And, but you felt it, you felt it, and there is \u0152 there were little incidents that were kind of always there. And, I remember walking with my father. Father came and the railroad station wasn\u2122t far from our home. It was like a five minute distance, you know? So, I used to \u0152 knowing that Father was coming, I used to run to the station to kind of welcome him and walk hom e with him. And one time, there was \u0152 it was during the time of the depression, and th e Polish workers were very unhappy because they went on strike, they weren\u2122t paid well enough, and it was a very bad situation in town. And every time something like that occurred, there was a much stronger antiSemitic reaction because it was \u0152 somebody had to be blamed for things that went wrong. So, I remember, as we went approaching the main entrance to our courtyard, there was a guy that we knew well and Father knew well, and he was standing there and he was giving out leaflets and he was repeating \ufb01Be zyda, be zyda\ufb02 (ph) \u0152 hit the Jew, hit the Jew. And as we came close, I\u2122ll never forget that, he took the leaflets in his hand and put them behind his back, and he already uttered the word \ufb01 Be zyda\ufb02 (ph) and he says \ufb01Ekonomiczie\ufb02, as we were crossing, he says, \ufb01Ekonomiczie.\ufb02 As if to say, not outright hit the Jew, but hit the Jew economically, whic h was more of a legitimized way to say it for my father not to get offende d, but he had expressed it.

            "answer": "Well, my school friends were one group, a nd my other friends were another group. Due to the fact that I lived in Wierzbnik, whic h was basically the community where the Jews lived before the consolida tion of the two. Very early, there was a community called Wierzbnik and there was a community called St arachowice. Wierzbnik was so to say the earlier where all Jews lived and some of the non-Jews who even were involved with the business or in city administration or in jobs, you know, but most people who worked in the factories lived in Starac howice. As a matter of fact, in Starachowice they had two streets, two main street s. One street was named Ulica Robotnieza, which means the street for the blue-collar clerks, and the other one was Ulica Urzdnicza , which was the street for the white-collar clerks, and as you passed the streets, you could see the difference in the living quarters and they were not too far apart, side by side, but in order to bring in the skilled engineers and the te chnicians that were needed in the factories, they had to give them something more than just the average housing. While the workers, you know, due to the fact that we were like three or four kilometers away from the factories, they settled closer to the factories so that they didn\u2122t have to travel that long of a distance. So, now, when they consolidated the two communities, we became one, and it was called Starachowice. Wierzbnik was where the Jews lived. Starachowice was \u0152 the school, when I went to high school, was Starachowice. And this is when I had to pass from home all the way, you know, three kilometers each way, and as we were getting closer and closer to school, more and more children joined the group, you know, because there was one route that we use, you know. So, actually, we we re three \u0152 in my class, there were three Jews, four Jews, three boys, myself and a nother girl and in the class above me was another Jewish girl. School opened the first two classes of high school at the time when I was ready to go to school. And in this my mo ther, too, had her finger. She was also very helpful in convincing the community that it\u2122s about time that the population of 40,000, which was right before the war, should have a school of higher education, not to have to send the children away from home. So, she organized a group, you know, and they discussed it long enough, and it took two years before the school was finally opened and it was just in time for me. So, now, I have th ese friends from Hebrew school that are my old friends, from Wierzbnik, with whom I feel very, very comfortable, then I have my friends from high school who do not live in Wier zbnik, very few. Most of them are living near the factories because their parents are working there, and our connections are more based on our school work. You know, every once in a while in addition to homework you have projects that you have to work together on, whatever it was, whether it was in math or whether it was in social studies, or whatever. One of us got an assignment, who was in charge, and we had to kind of a create a nucleus, a group of people who were responsible 16 for different things and we kind of made a presentation when, let\u2122s say, a commission came from Warsaw from the National Board of Education to see the progress that we are making. Usually, they had come for accreditati on and, you know, to evaluate the level of education in the schools, and we had a very wonderful school. We had a really great high school. So, I had friends from there with whom after school I had hardly contact, but it\u2122s interesting that, when I went to school, things were not so good yet at home, and I had to enter \u0152 I mean, as I said before, any high sc hool that you applied to you had to have an exam. So, I came out, I mean, very well on my exam. I was accepted to school. I was also given a 50 percent reduction in the tuition, but my tuition was twice as high as my sister\u2122s because hers was a federal school, and mine was a private school. But I was very fortunate that the teachers and the director of the school liked me a lot, and they recommended to me for tutoring younger childr en. So, I went to school, and from school usually the kids were the kids of the white-collar clerks in Starac howice who were just about ready to go to high school and they needed the preparatory exam and so, I was the one who was spending like an hour twice a week tutoring them, preparing them for the exam, and I was getting paid for it. So, this in a way defrayed the cost of my education. So, it was really interesting because on the one hand I was very secure and very accepted and comfortable, but if you were to say whether I was really seeking outright to be in their company, no, and for this reason, I don\u2122 t know whether I would have been very comfortable or I would have been uncomfortable, but I was well liked and respected. I am felt that I am very \u0152 I mean, with the school friends, I had never felt any anti-Semitic things directed at me personally. To the contrary, we were very, very friendly."

            "answer": "It was very strange because we were for the new school year. And in addition to being a me mber of a Zionist youth group, I was a member of a kind of a scout group. It was more than a scout group. It was kind of a patriotic Polish group. I don\u2122t remember even the name, that when you entered high school, you were kind of elevated to a position of responsibility, where you had to show your love for the country and responsibility, so forth and so on. So, being already in high school, I was a memb er of this particular group, and I loved Poland. I mean, to me, Poland was my country. I mean, I was a great patriot. I was \u0152 to me, if you would think in terms of how much do you love the country, I mean, to feel really good and comfortable, I rea lly loved Poland. Everything, Polish literature and whatever was Polish was the best thing in the world. There was nothing better. I really enjoyed it. So, I remember that rather th an to \u0152 like, a week earlier, before school started. We were called to come to school, and I can\u2122t recall who was the person who has addressed as members of this particular youth group, and they said to us \u0152 usually we wore the uniforms during May Day parades, you know, and we represented, carrying the flag of our school, and marched in the parade. S o, they told us that we have to put on the uniforms and we have to gather not far from th e factories because we have to dig trenches for protection from attacks that may come fr om airplanes, that there may be a war and 17 there is a danger of being bombed due to the fa ct that we have these factories and that it is our duty of young people who love the country to do it. S o, you know, I was so eager, you know. We all went to the place where they gave us the spades and we walk along with adults and we built the trenches and all that. Of course, they didn\u2122t drop the bombs on our town. They just threw two bombs on the railroad station. They whole town, the whole community left for the woods. Everybody was afraid that they\u2122ll bomb us to smithereens, and then I get, after the war, a Kalendarium , what they\u2122re called, from my hometown because I wanted to know more of what it was all about, you know. I went from childhood to adulthood and left the country. So, in the Kalendarium, I found out that the chief executive officer of the factory that was appointed or whatever, placed \u0152 who has gotten this position three years before the war, was a German, a spy, who not only spied for the Germans to let them know what is the operation like in this particular \u0152 because that was a whole region, not just St arachowice. There was Skarzysko-Kamienna; there was Radon; there was Pionki. They used to call it the central industrial area. So, we were just one part of that whole region, and we found out this particular guy was a German who was maybe a Volks Deutsch, you know? But basically he was operating with Germany, and he told them that to dest roy that would be ridiculous. They needed it for their war effort. So, I found out about it, you know, like in 1980, ten years ago, when I was finally established a very comfortable contact with my hometown, because I just didn\u2122t want to think about Poland, you know? I came to the United States and what the United States represents cannot compare with any country in the world, and for this reason I kind of felt that don\u2122t forget the past, but don\u2122t live in the past. Whether it was good or whether it was bad, it just doesn\u2122t make any difference, the past is the past, and for as long as you live you have to look towards \u0152 deal with the present and look toward the future. That\u2122s all to it."

            "answer": "We all went, we all went into the woods , the forest, you know? And we could hear the troops fighting, and we could hear the airplanes zooming by and bombs being dropped, but we were like about eight kilometers from town, you know, in the woods, and when everything calmed down and it was quiet, we re turned to town. So, we returned to town to find the situation like that. All the stores were looted. There was no food available. Homes were plundered. Whatever was, whatev er was of value was taken away. Whether it was done by the Germans or whether it was done by the Polish neighbors, I don\u2122t know, but that was the situation. I remember car rying the silver in a knapsack on my back to the woods and back, because Mother gave everybody something else to carry that was important. And we came back to home and our home, since we lived \u0152 by then we had moved to a modern apartment, because the home where I grew up was an old home, and the landlord didn\u2122t want to do much anymore in the repairing it and so forth and so on. So, we moved to another apartment that was built like \u212237, and it was built by a Christian, by a Pole, Wierzchowski, and he occupied the upper floor, and we were living on the 18 ground floor, and so it wasn\u2122t really a Jewish courtyard anymore, you know, it was kind of a mi x. There were some stores. I remember there was a Polish butcher who lived nearby in a small house, and I can\u2122t recollect b ecause it was a short period of time that we lived there. So, due to the fact that we we re not in a Jewish kind of \u0152 because some courtyards, they had 20, 30 families, and mostly Jewish, you know, so if the homes were plundered, you know who did it. But here, due to the fact there weren\u2122t too many, and so, we found everything in perfect order when I got home. So, th ere was nothing really that was broken or removed or glass broken. I\u2122m sure that they wouldn\u2122t have dared, you know? So\u2013 Because it was not a Jewish house. It was the property of a Pole, so they couldn\u2122t break windows in order to get in or whatever. And so it was hard because there was no food available and things were difficult to get."

            "answer": "Well, we came back, and of course, when we were out in the woods, you know, we didn\u2122t have much food. We took some bread with us and maybe a salami if I remember correctly, but we couldn\u2122t get any food. So, it was September and we were very close. We actually stayed in an agricultural school. Basically, it was a school, and also a kind of a laboratory, research laboratory where they were trying to introduce, you know, new ways of maybe growing things. So, there were a lot of cucumbers and a lot of tomatoes in the field, which I imagine that they had been gathered and sold at the market normally, but the war broke out and the students didn\u2122t come to school, so everything was left there. So, we ate them. You know, you sit in the dirt and you ate and you don\u2122t have water to wash your hands and so forth and so on. We got back home, and we had some potatoes left in the dark cellar because this is where you kept your roots for the winter, your root vegetables for the winter, and Mother went to the dark cellar and she brought up potatoes and Father says to set the table. So, we were kind of figuring on why does he insist on setting the table. He says, \ufb01I want the tablecloths on the table. I want the china on table.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01I want the silverware on the tabl e, and the napkins and lace because, just because there is a war doesn\u2122t mean that we have to eat like animals. We have to remember that we are people and we have to conduct ourselves in this manner.\ufb02 And, that\u2122s the kind of person that he was. That no matter what kind of a situation you encountered, first you have to always rememb er that you are a human being and you have to watch the way \u0152 you have to be aware of how you conduct yourself, and your behavior and there was always the priority, stressed on the importance of being civil and acting in proper manner, no matter what. So, we had our meal: that dry potato on a big plate. But everybody was happy. Father was happy. We wash ed the dishes afterwards. Everything was fine. 19"

            "question": "Did the three of you as children find it odd, even after the meal? Or did you\u2013?",
            "answer": "No, but that\u2122s the way it always has been. I mean, there was no kitchen table. The kitchen was a working place, and in the kitchen, we ha d a huge table, but it was a table that had like sides all around that was used like a work space where they were kneading the bread and cutting up the meat and doing all kinds of things, and you know, and baking and cooking and washing laundry and everything. That was what the kitchen was for. The dining room was where we ate, and it was this mahogany big table with the carved legs and the carved chairs around it, and whether it was breakfast or lunch or dinner, I mean, we didn\u2122t eat in the same manner as we do in the United States. You know, breakfast was fast because we all had to go to school, and Mother packed a little lunch to take along, and dinner was usually when we returned from school. That was the main meal around two-thirty, and then in the evening was just a small bite for suppe r, you know. So, it was just a sandwich with cheese or whatever, but the main meal was always during the day. And, it wasn\u2122t like here in the United States when you have meat or fish every day for your meal. I mean, a lot of times you make do with whatever was available, and mind you, it\u2122s not availability depended not so much on how money you had, but on the seasons. If, let\u2122s say, there was at one time, th ere was one product in abundance, let\u2122s say, and then the summer there are other products in abundance, and in the fall different things, and you kind of geared your whole planning around what was available in the particular season. So, I remember, like, Cornis h hens, young chickens, we used to have in the summer, and the geese and ducks were in the fall and the winter, and then for springs there were turkeys, I mean, but they were not every day on the table. We used to have like maybe twice, three times a week meat. Otherwise, it was dairy products and you had to be very, very kind of inventive in order to create meals and my mother was a gourmet cook and she really \u0152 when she entertained, it was unbelievable. When she set that table, it was fit for a king. I have this craze now \u0152 I have four sets of dishes and with stemware and with everything and different tablecloths because I have to \u0152 when I set the table it has to be \u0152 it has to have a very special touch. It\u2122s not just what\u2122s sitting there in the closet, I\u2122ll make an effort. I\u2122ll go to the b ack. I\u2122ll pull them out to set a certain mood. I don\u2122t do it as much lately because the kids are older, I mean, our children are older. They are out of the house. And Renia is like that, too, you know. And my dau ghter is like this, too, now, very much aware of what the table should be like, regardless of the meal. But, to make an attractive table all by itself make s the whole meal so much more pleasant. Whether you eat a dry potato or whether you have a gourmet meal, it doesn\u2122t matter, but it is when you enter the dining room, wh at you create artistically about the looks enhances the food you eat like that, too."

            "answer": "I don\u2122t remember. I don\u2122t remember, but you know, we felt so secure with our parents around us. You know, we never had to worry or plan our future. You know? We were in a home where the parents supervised our activ ities. I mean, they planned our schooling, they planned where we go to school, and we were very obedient children because we knew that whatever our parents are planning for us, for our future, that they know what they want and what we should be like from their own personal experience. And it\u2122s not just, you know, in some cases, where there were a lot of people that were totally illiterate before the war. There were people whose lite racy was very limited. Some people had two years of education, three years of education. They felt the need of education. They didn\u2122t have the opportunity. Therefore they wanted to give their children the opportunity to know more then they did. And the compulso ry years of study in school, in elementary schools in Poland, was kindergarten through seve nth grade. After seventh grade, you had enough. It could carry you through life, you know, and you were literate and you could read the paper, and you knew math and you kne w everything. But if you went to high school, then you were only in school for six years. And, it is like the junior high schools here, that was your first year of high school education, because we went from six years of elementary schools to four years of high sc hool and then two years of Litsonian (ph) which prepared you for the study at the university. So, if you think in terms of years of schooling, it was like 12 years from beginning to end, from grade one to entering the university, if you so desired. So, in my parents case, you know they were both educated, and education was very important to them and there was no question. I mean, there was no question whether we want or we don\u2122t want. It\u2122s like, you get up in the morning and you have to brush your teeth and wash your face and have breakfast, and so you have to study, that\u2122s it.

            "answer": "Plebiscite, thank you. Depending on wh ere you lived, you know, once the border was drawn, whether you originally German or originally Polish, wherever you lived, you became the citizens of this particu lar count ry. So, since the borders had been shifting constantly, there were a lot of German fam ilies who, after the First World War, after the pact in Versailles, were separated from their families and so forth and so on, and remained on the new Polish territories. So, so me of them spoke Polish because in their families there were Poles and there were Germans and Poles and Germans, and they were intermarried so it didn\u2122t really matter that much. But, in some cases, the people felt very strong attachment to Germany, and they con-, inasmuch as they did in Poland, and they send the children to Polish schools, they considered themselves Germans. So, when the Germans entered Poland, of course, they were more then happy to welcome them because this is what they always wanted. We lived in central Poland, so we were far removed from both influences, the Russians and the Germans and even the Austrians from the south; because we were part of that heart of Poland that Napoleon has created in a way, that Kongrasuvka (ph) that he called. So, this is why they came, the Germans came, marched through town and sang the songs and al l that, with victorious people, came. And it took about two or three weeks before they had organized the whole thing. And they started to catch Jews in the street to do work. Actually, not so much for work as to humiliate the Jew. So, I remember, I was walkin g with my father in the street, and he was an elegant man, as I said before, and always proper and always neat, always neat, and he was wearing a hat and a suit and we walki ng on the sidewalk, and a German walks by from the opposite direction, and he says, \ufb01You\u2122re a Jew! You have no right to walk on the sidewalk. The sidewalks are not mean t for the Jews.\ufb02 And, he pushed him. Unexpectedly \u0152 I mean when somebody attack s you like that \u0152 and he pushed him in the gutter. Really, he fell into the gutter and he was wearing glasses, and his hat fell off. He was wearing a hat not because he was religious, but that was part of that elegance of his kind of a demeanor. And his glasses fell and he felt so horrible, so humiliated, and the guy kicked him over and over again, and he wa nted to pick himself up. I remember, he spoke, no, he was asked him, \ufb01 Bist du ein Jude?\ufb02 - Are you a Jew? And he said, \ufb01Yes!\ufb02 22 And since my father had a lot of dealings with German people, I m ean, at the time he had business contacts. Before the war, he was re presenting an internat ional company and the people at the time he dealt were also busine ss people from also large companies. So, there has never been in my father\u2122s, I imag ine, mind a disrespect for him being a Jew. And just from the soldier walking and at the me re fact that he was honest and said he was a Jew, to be pushed off the sidewalk into the gutter and to be kicked when he tried to pick himself up, and his glasses broke, and he was br uised on his face, and he got all dirty and everything, that was the first indication. I mean, this is for the first time that I understood what the war was all about. Up until that ti me, I don\u2122t think I could comprehend what war really means because the stories that I have heard from either my parents or my grandma about wars before, like the First World Wa r, they had experienced, was basically contained in the area in which they \u0152 through which the front went through. Fifty kilometers away from the front, life has not been disturbed in any way whatsoever. Only, if you happen to find yourself in the path of marching troops or battle s or whatever, that you knew that there was a war. But, in that Blitzkrieg that the Nazis created, there was no such thing as so to say limiting to one speci fic area or having battles in one area. They just went through the whole country - within one week, there was no Polish government anymore, and immediately th e Nazi occupation took over."

            "answer": "I remember Germans came in and looked around, and of course, you know, everybody was aware that they are comi ng and asking for things. They were elegant. They were not just soldiers who were coming; they were officers who were coming to different homes. And they used to look around and if they liked something, they just asked to be wrapped. I remember a friend of mine used to say - he came in and he saw that \u00e9pini\u00e8re on the table, and he says to my mother, \ufb01 Oh, das ist schoen. Bitte mir das einpacken,\ufb02 as if to say, \ufb01This is beautiful. Please wr ap it for me.\ufb02 You know? So, this is one of the sayings that I remember from confiscati ng things. Again, I think that due to the fact that we were not really \u0152 the second, the new apartment that we were in, since it has not been necessarily an all-together Jewish courtyard, that I don\u2122t remember the Germans coming, really coming in. But what I remember from the second apartment that we lived is the war started, there was no school for Jewish children, none whatsoever. We were all school age. And again, I\u2122m going to bring in my parents, you don\u2122t leave children hanging around doing nothing. So, again, my moth er\u2122s ingenuity, she says, \ufb01Listen, it\u2122s war. You cannot go to school. This does not mean that you\u2122re going to sit idle.\ufb02 Hania is older than you. In 1940, we already had a lot of Jews from large and from Lodz and from Poznan (ph), you know, from the regions that we re incorporated into the Reich. And from the large cities, people were displaced and were brought to our town with children who were our contemporaries, and they were educ ated people, and they were sophisticated people. So, my mother, in order for me to not to kind of be my sister\u2122s student, where she would kind of do whatever she wants with me, maybe, has gotten three other youngsters who were my contemporaries, and my older si ster was teaching us every day as if we were to go to a regular school, okay? When I wa s done with my classes \u0152 they were in the afternoon \u0152 in the morning, I was teaching younge r children. And here we have in the new apartment, we already had a small kitchen table. So, while my older sister was with some student in the living room, I was sitti ng on the window, I remember, on the ledge. It was summertime. It was so nice and warm in the forties, and I loved the sun \u0152 and I had around the table these little kids who I taught to read and taught to write. And it was that thing that we continued, you know, to keep our selves busy, number one, to continue with our educations, number two, and even Renia used to play with the little kids. These were not even of school age, but just to give her something to do. So, we had this kind of a 24 feeling of responsibility to ourselves, and to others as well. So, it was all the kids in the neighborhood and mostly children of our friends younger then us."

I mean, if you were called, not every day, but there were all kinds of jobs that required on the part of the German Nazi administration that needed to be done, and the boys who were at the time 15 or 16, instead of having their fathers go and do the job, they went to work.

But, we used to get together with friends, you know, and since our ghetto was not closed ghetto, it was an open ghetto, it means that part of the town wh ere there was a large concentration of Jews was, got to be a little more crowded with the fact that there were newcomers coming through from territories that were incorporated in the Reich, and also the few who lived not really in Jewish sections were forced to move out and to move into the designated ghetto area, and this is what happened to us in the \u212240s. We left ev erything behind in the apartment because we just \u0152 instead of havi ng a three-bedroom, three-bedroom \u0152 a fourroom apartment, we move into a one-room apartment. It was large enough, you know, for us to put beds at one end and tables, and a ta ble at the other. We kind of had some space; we were not crowded. But we still had Polish people living near us, you know. So, some sections of town were completely eliminated from Jews, but other sections with Jews and non-Jews lived together. Of course, the more people were coming in, the more we were crowded, and we had to kind of accept anothe r family to live with us. And when you live with a family and you are limited to the sp ace and you lose some privacy, it\u2122s all right when you were only with your own family. But when another family comes in that you don\u2122t know, that is totally strange, whose livi ng habits are different from yours, and who are uprooted and who are strange, and it had this problem with adjustment. No matter how hospitable you are, you still have to have a certain amount of privacy, and this coexistence with strangers was a very difficult thing to overcome. Oh, it was okay. And then we find an apartment which was the last apartment before the ghetto was liquidated, which was a house on the border of \u0152 almost out of town \u0152 which was the borderline, but the end of the ghetto. And there was a property and this property was kind of a duplex. It was on the river. It was a duplex, and in one part of the house was the owner, who was Polish, on the side of the non-ghetto side, and this was kind of still considered to be part of the ghetto. So, in this house, we had a bedroom and a kitchen, and we didn\u2122t have anybody to live with us because he wouldn\u2122t allow \u0152 the Polish owner would not allow any more than just one family. So, in a way, this gave us, you know, again, a better feeling of a family unit, you know, that we had a little more privacy. But, we were gathering with our friends. Some of them had on the outskirts, like, I had a friend who went to school with me and they also were in the lumber business that was established by their grandfather. They were well-to-do peopl e, and we used to go. They had the river, and they were, you know \u0152 because they need ed the water for the processing of wood, they were \u0152 like Bentwood for chairs, you know, this was their business. So, it was really wonderful. It was secluded, and they had like a little beach area. So, this is where we used to go Saturdays, and just sit around and talk and have time, you know, with our friends to ourselves. And, Saturdays usually was a quite time, you know, and Sundays, too. So, her parents were very, very religious. So, she liked to be with us. We had this freedom. We used to sit on the beach and enj oy the sunshine and talk, and everybody was 26 doing something important. I remember one frie nd was a terrific knitter. She could knit anything in the world, and she used to sit and knit sweaters, you know, and this is the way how she was supporting herself during the war because I think she lost her mother. Her father was in Israel. They were supposed to go to Israel, and I don\u2122t know how it came about, but she was alone and she lived, so to say, with the cousins, and she was sitting always and knitting, and this is how she used to support herself. She used to make the most beautiful hand-knitted sweaters a nd everything. But, those days you don\u2122t have no yarn. So, you used to rip apart old scarves, and old sweaters, and caps and whatever, and make a new garment and you have to be a genius to match the colors, to come up with an interesting product, which she always did. She was wonderful. And we used to spend time, and that was our free time, you know. Again, it was always in the company of the friends with who I went to Hebrew school and who were my, so to say, also members of the Zionist youth group and we were recollecting, you know, reminiscing the wonderful days that we had. We had a leader in the youth group. At first, we had a group when we were very young; we belonged to Hano\u2122ar Ha\u2122t Zioni. That was the Zionist children\u2122s group. And then, when we got a little bit older, there was a kind of another branch of the same organization, but it was more on an intellectual level, and it was called Akiba and Akiba used to be, I mean, we didn\u2122t have anyone in town who could really supervise us at this level. So, Krakow was the center or Akiba, and they were sending to us leaders who were coming once a week to spend time with, once a month, I\u2122m sorry \u0152 to spend time and teach us songs and lecture and discuss Hebrew writers and Hachman Bialik and all those th ings. So, we \u0152 I remember one leader who was with us in 1939 and her name was Vushka Liebeskind a nd she was, during the war, she married Dolek Liebeskind, who was the head of the resistance movement in Krakow. So, to us she was everything in the world. We couldn\u2122 t wait long enough for her, you know, from one month to the other to come. And mind you that in Auschwitz, she found us. She was in prison too. And what she has done to our spirit in one hour, in Auschwitz, when we were really \u0152 it was Yom Kippur. We were \u0152 we arrived in July and we lost completely track of time, and I don\u2122t know whether the ho lidays fell in September or October, but somewhere around there. I don\u2122t remember exac tly. She has been in prison since 1943, and because she was the kind of a person she was, and had outside contacts due to the fact that they were part of the resistance movement in Krakow, that she had connections which allowed her to kind of move around the camp a lot freer, let\u2122s say, than a person without connections. And I understand now that she was the one who put the emphasis in the spiritual aspect of that survival in c oncentration camp, and from what I heard about her was that she was finding little pieces of candles that were \u0152 you know, in the beginning, there was no electricity in camp, so th ey used candles, or whenever they were not allowed to use electricity and they still needed in the barracks a light, you know, for the work, for the administrative work, they had the candles. So, when the candle was almost at the end, you know, it was discarded. So, from what I understand, she used to collect the pieces of candles and bring them to people on Friday night, right before the Lagerruhe, you know, before people were not allowed to leave the barracks. And she used to say the blessings and people \u0152 it did not make to her any difference which barracks she went to, wherever there were women \u0152 and that\u2122s what she did. And we 27 were already, so to say, with a noose around our necks, in such a bad situation, because it was already three months that we already ar rived in Birkenau, and you know, that it was, so to say, a point where we didn\u2122t say any chance for survival or anything. And I remember we came from the ward, and a very pretty woman with a striped uniform and a kerchief around her hair, you know, her hair was cropped short. She was not \u0152 her head was not shaved like ours, but she had this and she had very good shoes on her feet, and I thought, \ufb01Well, you have to be well connected to kind of look this way when you were in camp.\ufb02 And she started to ask around. It was after the Z\u00e4hlappel, after we had been counted. Sometimes we had like half an hour be fore we were allowed to the barracks, or sometimes we were immediately forced to go into the barracks, and she says, \ufb01Are any girls her from Starachowice?\ufb02 So, there were fi ve or six of us that were members of the youth movement, and she told us who she was. Of course, we were unrecognizable at the time. I mean, from hunger and from beating a nd from the condition that we were and the clothes that we wore, we all looked like skeletons already and ridiculous really. So, she says, \ufb01Girls, don\u2122t worry.\ufb02 She says, \ufb01I\u2122m goi ng to visit you again,\ufb02 and she says, \ufb01It\u2122s late now. I must run to the barracks before they catch me after the allowed time to be outside.\ufb02 And, then she came. And it was the eve of Yom Kippur, Kol Nidre night. And she came with candles, and she got up on th e bunk bed and the candles were lit, and nobody knew Kol Nidre by heart. I mean, we were \u0152 how could we remember? We remembered the chanting, just the melody. S o, we were chanting the Kol Nidre melody, and it was kind of an outpour of a feeling for unity, because it was something that we had in common from not from this period in Auschwitz, but from another time. And, of course, we couldn\u2122t have that much time to sp end with her so, she just brought the spirit of the holiday to us, and kissed and she says, \ufb01Don\u2122t give up.\ufb02 I remember, \ufb01Don\u2122t give up.\ufb02 And we parted company. And when we stopped our chanting, the barracks was divided in four sections, and the extreme left of our ba rracks, there was a group of women from Italy, Jewish women from Italy. And when we stopped the Kol Nidre, they started to sing \ufb01Mama Son Tanta Felice\ufb02, like an expression of their longing to the life that they had been deprived of just like we. Ours was a religious expression of some thing that was meaningful and traditional. They ma ybe did not understand. I\u2122m sure they were Jews. They should have been familiar, but their reaction to this chanting in a very quiet voice coming from the other side was just so overwhelming that I will never forget it. So, what I think about it is that in the worse times, when you have a little spark of normalcy, when you can\u2122t think what life is really like in normal existence, when you think in terms of the holiday and observing the holiday and preparing for it, or whatever connection you have, you know, with something that is near an d dear to you, if you can create it in the most horrible situation, it still can be very, very uplifting. I shouldn\u2122t\u2013cry."

Mam a, you know, inasmuch as it st arts \ufb01Mama Son Tanta Felice\ufb02, which means Mama, I\u2122m so happy, but you know when I think of this melody and when I heard it for the first time, you know, a nd it kind of reminds me of Mein Yiddishe Mame to a certain extent, it\u2122s a different mama, it\u2122s a different situation, but it\u2122s the longing for home. It\u2122s the longing for mother. It\u2122s the mo ther who, in my opini on, that it represents the home, and the security and everything, and this is what they really needed and this is what they wanted. So, I\u2122ll wipe my eyes."

            "question": "So, if we can go back to the ghetto now, fo r\u2013 If you can explain to people, because they don\u2122t \u0152 there are different ways in which ghettos function, different ways people moved. When you have to move from your apartment that you were living underneath the gentile, the Polish Catholic, were you forced to moved out and forced to move into a particular place or did you choose the place?",
            "answer": "Well, we couldn\u2122t choose much really. You see the Judenrat was formed, and then Judenrat was basically the admi nistration of the ghetto and the people, and they were responsible for all the demands made by the Nazi authorities or whatever. Whether it was a demand for contributions or whether it wa s a demand for labor or whether it was \u0152 whatever the demand was. So, my father, due to the fact that he was very familiar with figures and very familiar with the German language was asked by the Judenrat to supervise the working groups that were comi ng daily to work. They gave him this job, you know, he was not part of the Judenrat. He was not a member of the Judenrat, but rather than to have the soldiers come ev ery morning and catch people in the street, whoever was available and most of the peopl e who were caught in the street where not even fit for the work that they wanted them to do. So, the Judenrat came to the conclusion that it would be much better if there was lik e an employment office where the authority, the Nazi authorities would come and sa y, \ufb01We need that many, so-and-so people tomorrow for work.\ufb02 And, that this number of people should be sent for the daily work and eliminate this Lapaniki, as they call them, that they can \u0152 Lapa means to drag, to drag people off the street. So, they gave my father the job. My father \u0152 they gave him a list of all the people who were registered because food was rationed, so in order to receive food you have to register with the Judenrat, whether you were a local person or whether you were a person who was brought from a different area to town. All those people had to be registered. So, the first job my father was given is to register all the people who are able to perform work. Now, in the open ghetto, there were still people conducting business, because once things had settled down there wasn\u2122t that much business. You didn\u2122t deal in extraordinary things, but you know, the guy who was selling 29 shoes and galoshes, as long as he had a supplier who provided the me rchandise to him, he could do it, or the guy was selling sweaters or whatever. The bakery had to be run, you know, and all that. So, first of all, the Judenrat gave my father the entire list of people who were able to work, and on this basis, my father could prepare a list. Let\u2122s say there was a demand for 200 people or 100 people what ever it was, and he has arranged it in such a way that everybody had to perform the work once a week in the beginning. Assuming that you were designated to come to work on Tuesday, and either you were too busy or you didn\u2122t want to, as long as you were able to pay another person to fill in for you, it was okay. And there were \u0152 those people who didn\u2122t want or couldn\u2122t go and were able to afford it were more than happy to pay for the day\u2122s work to another person, and in most cases, the people who were filling for this person were people who were displaced, who needed the day\u2122s work, because when they went to work they got paid from the man whose place they have taken, and they have gotten a bowl of soup and some bread on the job. So, this worked extremely well, and it was calm due to the fact that Father could \u0152 what do I want to say \u0152 he communicated with them and there were no beatings and there was no chasing and there was no running, and it was calm and it was good. As a matter of fact, you know, he sometimes used to come ho me and say, \ufb01It\u2122s such a shame,\ufb02 he says, \ufb01I had so many eager people today who want ed to go and work, and there was none of demand for them to be sent.\ufb02 It was just \u0152 that was in the beginning, because later on the whole thing didn\u2122t matter, you know, no matter how orderly you were. But there were really people coming there every morning and sitting there waiting for someone who came in and say, \ufb01I\u2122m not going to work t oday. Who\u2122s the guy who\u2122s going to be in my place and take it for the day?\ufb02 It was a perf ect kind of an arrangement, and it was peace and calm and wonderful, and it went on like this because the jobs were meaningless in the beginning. All they did was to humiliate the people, to get them out, the permanent people in the community, and kick them and be at them, just like the incident with my father, and just make life difficult. But when things began to kind of become more or less orderly, they came to the conclusion that they needed the Jews not just for the manual work of sweeping the street, giving the perm anent people a broom to sweep or whatever to humiliate them, but they can use them pe rforming manual work in factories. They started to make demands for labor force fo r the factory. So, this whole thing changed about, too, because, from that group that was trying to kind of find other people to fill for them at work, they realized what is going on in other parts of the country, where people, if they are not employed, are been resettle d, taken away, that they seek themselves employment and in order to have the arbeitskarte, they went to work. So, there\u2122s this arbeitskarte, which is the certificate of employme nt, protected you from being deported later on. So, you know, everything was kind of a gradual change from a bad situation into a worse situation, and constantly changing because the demands were greater and greater and greater. First they took away your money, and then they took away your valuables and your furs \u0152 do you know that as a child in my picture with my two sisters, I\u2122m wearing like a three-quarter coat that already I was growing and it was time for me to get a new coat. And then the war broke out and I still had that coat. It was very warm because it had a lining, a fur lining, that I was walking in that jacket in the street and a German soldier ripped off the fur collar of my coat, telling me that a Jew does not wear 30 fur. It was not a fur piece. He did not even know the lining there was like a shell would you say, right? But just by ripping off a collar of my coat\u2013 So, you know, they were imposing all kinds of things every day, every day. First, you know, that they confiscated the valuables from you. They took everythi ng you had. Then they made you wear the armband with \u0152 the white armband with the blue star, the Star of David, and no matter how old you were, whether you were ten years old or whether you were an old person, you had to be identified as a Jew. And if they caught you without the armband and, even though for us to mix in with the Polish populat ion wasn\u2122t so difficult because we weren\u2122t really locked in or fenced in, but nobody, nobody dared to even to take off the armband. We kind of felt that this is what we have to, and this is how we have to work, and it\u2122s going to be all right, and the Judenrat really, the people who were in the Judenrat were people who were leaders of the community before the war. They were decent, nice, elegant people who were friends of my parents, who were memb ers of the Zionist organization, who worked together, you know, and they just assumed this responsibility to have a peaceful Jewish community, for it to continue. But you never knew, every morning was a different demand for the speci al assessment of funds. They came that unless the community\u2122s going to produce so and so many zlotys, you know, for whatever within 24 hours, there are going to be measures taken that everybody\u2122s going to regret. So, of course, each and every family was a ssessed with some contribution in order to create the funds that were demanded. So, life wasn\u2122t easy, but Father was pleased that he could occupy peacetime in a very constructive way, and he was instrumental in creating, so to say, a controlled atmosphere in the ghetto, where Jews did not have to be grabbed in the morning, you know, whether they were on th eir way to a morning service or running \u0152 there was no synagogue, anyhow, because the synagogue was burned on Yom Kippur day in our town. They thought that Kol Nidre night \u0152 they didn\u2122t realize that Kol Nidre was the eve before Yom Kippur, and they knew that the Jews are going to be congregated on Yom Kippur in the synagogue. So, they came in the evening hoping that the synagogue is going to be full of Jews, and torched it. But nobody was there and nobody prayed in the synagogue anyhow; everybody had their prayers in home in, you know, and gathered in private homes or in the quarters of different organizations that they had, like small little clubs. They weren\u2122t really \ufb01clubs\ufb02 as we know them in the United States, but, you know, a gathering place for different organizations because there was the general Zionists and there was the Betar and there was the revisionists and, you know, that was the group of Jabotinsky and there was an orthodox group of Jews who I don\u2122t remember the name of their organization. So, you know , it was more like gathering out of sight where you couldn\u2122t be too obvious and not too many people at the same time could be found in one particular place."

            "answer": "That was very modern by comparison with what was available. So, we moved and this apartment has been giv en to us by the Judenr at because they knew which homes were in the ghetto where you were permitted to live a nd, on the basis of how large the family was, they were so to say \u0152 it\u2122s like my father, who was running the department of supplying the labor force to the factories, there was a person who was in charge of allocating living quarters for people. So, I really don\u2122t know who was in charge, but anyhow, when we were forced to move from that apartment, we went to live in that one room which was a large room, a very large room, but it was not \u0152 it must have been a store at one time or another because I vaguely remember seeing a stove or anything like that. It was kind of \u0152 it was a large space, but nothing to it, and then when we had to share it with another family because it was such a large space, it wa s not a home of any kind. This is why my memories are so\u2013 not quite clear. All I remember is that it was a large space. It was our second move. It was our \u0152 we had another move yet. From there, we had to move to another one which was a courtyard also full of Jews, and there, it was all very, very hard, because we were so many families. Not just in our apartment, we always had to share an apartment with anot her family, but there were \u0152 every single apartment had additional people and depe nding on the size, you know, you were allowed to a room and then you shared the kitchen f acilities or whatever. So, that was the third move, and then finally, this for the last year or so in the ghetto, this apartment on the border of the ghetto and the outside of the ghetto was available, and this is, I\u2122m sure that it\u2122s, it has been wonderful, it has been a blessing to be able to be by ourselves, but then Mother was working, and every apartment ha s something that was so painful and so horrible. Mother was working with people as I told you before, and she was the one who had helped to organize the soup kitchens for the people who were coming, brought to the ghetto and they were bringing constantly people because they needed people to work in the factories. So, and there were a lot of destitute people who had nothing so, providing for them, everyone to live, was one of the most important things. Providing for them a job where they could go to the factory and even though at the time we weren\u2122t paid anything, anymore \u0152 once you went to the fact ory, you were not paid a penny, and by that time, everybody was anxious to have an employment card. So, nobody was willing to give the destitute people any help. So, they organized the soup kitchen, and Mother was there working every day, and one day she came home and she was sick with Typhoid."

            "question": "Typhoid? Typhus or Typhoid?",
            "answer": "Typhus, typhus from lice. She must have been bitten by a lice working with the poor people, by a louse, and she got very, very sick. And I was always there, in no matter what situation, I was the one who was the most trained to be of assistance, and I\u2122ll tell you why. A very logical thing \u0152 my oldest sister was not home. She was away in school when 32 she was growing up. She left home very early at the age of twelve. So, she wasn\u2122t around home base, you know, to be taught or to observe or to learn. Renia, my little sister, was a little thing. So, I always \u0152 it seems like my parents kind of felt that I am of more help to them than anyone of us. So, I remember that when Mother got very sick and the doctor came to see her \u0152 you know, we had Jewish doctors in town and they all were friends. It\u2122s not just like \u0152 they didn\u2122t come as a docto r. They came to help you because they were doctors and they had the medical knowledge . And I remember how the doctor sat down with me and he said to me \u0152 it was like the fourth or the fifth day, and it takes like six days, twelve days from the time when you get sick until you go through the crisis. So, in the beginning, you know, he just was coming in every day to look after her and gave her whatever kind of medication he had availabl e. I don\u2122t know. But then, towards the eighth day, he sat me down and he said to me, \ufb01It\u2122s going to be very, very difficult for your mother for the next four days, and I want you to know that you, that it\u2122s up to you how much attention you are going to pay and how much time you are going to spend with her in order to assist her and pull through this difficult period.\ufb02 And, he explained to me what kind of symptoms to look for, that her fever is going to get very, very high, and there is very little medication that can be acquired because, you know, it\u2122s not normal times, and he will try his very best but he doesn\u2122t know how much he can do, that I have to always be at my mother\u2122s bedside, that she does not need food, but she needs that constant presence by her side, because the fever is going to be very, very high and I have to watch her very carefully and I have to have a basin of cold water and I have to have washcloths to change her compress on her head. That was the only thing you could do to kind of bring down the temperature. And, you know, I listened. You know, somebody said to me that I am very good in doing thing, you know , the right way. I am always following instructions very carefully because what I am taught; I was always told very carefully how to proceed in doing things. So, if you follow instructions, you follow instructions. But, anyhow, this was his advice and I didn\u2122t know what to anticipate really, but I listened very carefully and I got prepared. And the tenth day was not so bad. Mother was still aware of the fact that I was around, and the doctor told me that nobody should be in the room with her, just I, and to keep the sh ades in the window closed so that the room is dark. It should not disturb her, so that she has a lot of sleep, because this is very, very important, but at the same time, I shouldn\u2122t allo w her to sleep for too long, because this is very bad for her. Mind you, I\u2122m only fifteen years old or sixteen, whatever \u0152 and, you know, the worst day was the night of the eleventh, the eleventh day of her sickness. When I touched her, the heat was unbelievable and she \u0152 she was kind of delirious, she didn\u2122t know what was happening, and she was talking and she was saying, \ufb01Take her away from me. I just don\u2122t like her. She is so ugly. She is so horrible with the black clothes on.\ufb02 I\u2122m sitting there with the person that I love so much, and here is this horrible responsibility on my shoulders, and the doctors gave strict orders to everybody. He said, \ufb01Pull the mattress out of this room, put it in the kitchen somewhere, and stay if you want. If you want your mother to live, you have got to give her total and complete peace and quiet.\ufb02 It was something that I\u2122ll never forget because, if you think in terms of fighting back, you know, and having that strength to realize that this is the moment, and asking for this death to be taken away. I mean, after all, who is there in the black thing looking 33 horrible? You know, and that was very, ve ry difficult \u0152 later afternoon, usually the temp erature was rising. In the morning, the temperature was not as high, but as the afternoon set in it was always very, very high and it was getting higher and very bad, and I was changing her compresses and holding my hand on her hand to just give her comfort, for her to know that somebody is with her, and finally the following morning, she opened her eyes. And I could see that she feels better because for two days, she didn\u2122t even \u0152 her eyes were just almost, not co mpletely closed, but I could see that the temperature was really getting her down. A nd, you know, then she got well. I felt good that I have a mother. That was wonderful, ve ry happy, that I was capable to do the job. My sisters, of course, no doubt, were just as happy as I was, and Mother went right back to work as soon as she felt better, she resumed her obligations that was the community and the people in the community and so forth and so on. Then, more and more people had to be employed in the factories so everybody w ho lived in town outside of the very old and the very sick had to go to work, and Mother was working also in the factories in a department, and my little sister was working in the factory, and Hania, my older sister, and myself were working in the beginning in a brick factory because they needed brick for construction of new space for the manufactur e of arms, and Father was in charge of the arbeitsamt, making sure that if somebody was sick and couldn\u2122t go to work, that he found someone who went to work that day, a nd then came the liquidation of the ghetto."

            "question": "Who took care of you once that was over? Did anybody think about this happening?",
            "answer": "No, as a matter of fact, I remember, when the doctor came and she felt better, and the doctor came and he says \u0152 as I said before , the doctor was a friend. He didn\u2122t come because we could afford the luxury of a doctor, you know. He came by because he was a friend and he wanted to assist her. So, I sa y to him, \ufb01She didn\u2122t eat in two days. What should I give her?\ufb02 Not that we had that mu ch food, but the food was Russian and so we have bread and we have a jam and saccharin, and Ersatz coffee and stuff like that. He says, \ufb01She shouldn\u2122t be eating anything heavy, and I know that you can not cook her soup or anything like that. I\u2122m going to see to it that I get for you a little bit of farina, like, grits or whatever.\ufb02 And, he says, \ufb01And, I\u2122ll show you how to cook it, because you cannot prepare anything that she won\u2122t be able to eat.\ufb02 I still remember how I pulled out that little pot and he told me how much water to put it in and put it on the stove, and he measured it with a teaspoon or a tablespoon, I don\u2122t remember, and how he taught me how to prepare that tablespoon of farina. When to put it in, \ufb01When the water comes to a 34 boil,\ufb02 he says, \ufb01Put it in. Stir it. Cook it for about two or three mi nutes until it becomes thicker in its consistency. Let it cool a little bit, and feed your mother, and give it to her three times a day.\ufb02 And, then he said to me, \ufb01And when she feels a little better...\ufb02 I still remember the order of the food that she wa s supposed to eat. He says, \ufb01And when she feels a little better, make su re that you get hold of some beets and because if you cook the beets the beet juice is going to be very helpful for her blood circulation with that.\ufb02 Beets are for blood, whether it was circulation or anything, to strengthen her. This is how much I remember. It was a responsibility, but it was nothing. It wasn\u2122t a burden. It was something I did with the great est of love to make sure that Mother survived. Well, Mother was the best, in my opinion, in the world. There haven\u2122t been too many people like her who have done so much for others, and yet she was the first one to be taken away from us, and she was the first one to go to Treblinka, by some freak accident. So, what am I to tell you? Then, three years later, or a year later, when we were in camp already, my two sisters got sick with Typhus, but by then I was already experienced. Then my father got sick, and then I got sick. So, it was \u0152 I was the nurse going from one to the other, but the cases, as they were coming along, there was a lot less to work with, and there was no advice from a doctor anymore because the doc tor wasn\u2122t there anymore. And, but somehow we managed, and some how we survived. So, the ghetto was liquidated in October 1942. Up to that point, things were not the best, but things were not the worst, because when you went to work, you received some food at the factory. There was always soup served during, you know, we worked 12 hours. There were two shifts for the Jews. Normally, the factory worked on three shifts for the regular workers. The Jews were working 12-hour shifts. So, ther e was always food, a bowl of soup, that was served during the working hours. So, in a way, you know, you didn\u2122t have much to eat in the morning when you left for work, but somehow somewhere along the line, your soup came along and a little coffee and it was okay. It \u2122s, it\u2122s the kind of existence where you really are so limited to what you can do, a nd what you can say and what you can think, and it isn\u2122t like I\u2122m going to rebel or I\u2122m goi ng to strike or anything. You had no choices. There are no choices. All you had to do was just kind of constantly submit to everything that is imposed on you and you have to do and do and do, and try to deal with it in a way that you don\u2122t break down emotionally or phys ically, because I could see that anybody who couldn\u2122t deal with it didn\u2122t last too long. They didn\u2122t have to be in Auschwitz. Auschwitz was the worst experience, but even here. There were two friends of mine who came from Lodz ghetto, twin sisters, beautif ul girls. One was a redhead, I mean, there wasn\u2122t a person in the world who wouldn\u2122t notice her, you know? She had the wonderful personality. She was friendly and pretty and everything, and the other was very dark \u0152 dark hair, but bright, well brought up, nice, wonderful two girls. And up until the time they were in ghetto, their parents were with them, and from the ghetto they were employed, and for one reason or another, the people \u0152 their parents \u0152 did not survive. Those two girls didn\u2122t last long at all. First of all, they came from most likely a wealthy home and therefore they didn\u2122t know how to take care of themselves. So, outside of being hungry and having very little to eat and not having their parents around to care for them, they didn\u2122t even know how to wash their underwear that they were wearing. I mean, all you had was one set. If you\u2122re lucky, you have two, right, for a change, but no matter 35 what, if you have one or two, we always ma naged somehow to keep ourselves clean. Those two girls, you could see them fade aw ay. There was nothing. They just couldn\u2122t manage. They had each other and they couldn\u2122t help one another because they were both helpless.

            "question": "You spoke a few minutes ago, prior to telli ng the story of the two sisters who could not withstand what was going on, and you said pe ople had no choices, but in some ways you really describe choices. You chose to have a certain relationship to what was happening, or didn\u2122t you? It was that you chose not to be defeated in what was going on, in so far as one could choose those kinds of things.",
            "answer": "I wouldn\u2122t call it choices. I don\u2122 t think that choices would be the right application in this particular case because you c ouldn\u2122t predict what is going to happen, not from one day to another. From one morning to the en d of the day, you never know, you couldn\u2122t anticipate what is going to ta ke place. So, I wouldn\u2122t say that, that choice is the right description of the situation. I feel that you have to have a very strong desire to live, and if you have a strong desire to live, I think that one can manage, under the most adverse condition, to live or try to kind of survive in a way that one doesn\u2122t break down and one doesn\u2122t emotionally. The worst thing was br eaking down emotionally. Physically, from one day to another, we were really losing our strength and it was quite obvious, but no matter what your physical condition was if you were not outright sick, and you did not give in, but you had this feeling that you would overcome the difficulties because you want to survive, then this was, in a way, your strength that gave you hope. Hope was the most important thing because, if you had hope, you didn\u2122t breakdown emotionally. Once you broke down emotionally and you were re signed completely that life is not worthwhile living, or you would find yourself in a situation that who needs it anymore to suffer so much. Everybody that one loved is gone and to just remain alone in this world. There were many situations like such situati ons like this. Some people did not survive because they didn\u2122t know how to manage. So me people did not survive because they were too aggressive and for this they were punished by being killed or clobbered to death. Some people did not survive due to the fact th at they were physically so exhausted that they came to the conclusion that, whether they go to work that day and drop dead on the job or whether they will not get out of bed, but quote-unquote-unquote, it was always they \u0152 what do you call it? The bunk bed or the bert h or whatever that you slept in, it just didn\u2122t make any difference at all. And it was women who were older who had families whose children were taken away from them like in Auschwitz, who didn\u2122t know whether their husband survived or not, to them life was meaningless. It took a very, very strong individual really to have this very strong desire to live when it came to who had the family life or already had responsibility to a husband and children. And, it is, I think, young people like ourselves who \u0152 maybe that was that instinct of a survival, like a young puppy who is in a situation that is not familiar with and the momma dog is not around, and they have to someho w either hide or whatever to get out of the situation. Quite often I think about it, in such a way, that instinctive in a way animalistic, which is maybe not the right expression. The desire to survive, without logic, without anything, but just that instinct, that feeling that I have to manage, I have to be aware that it is a very dangerous situation, and somehow I must get out if it. So, this was very important, and then it was very important to have someone who was able to assist you, and there were 37 people who were willing to assist you \u0152 not because they knew you, not because they wanted to, it was just that it was \u0152 it just happened. It happened so that you were at the right place at the right time , and somebody who was right there near you who was willing to help you. And this kind of a situation we found ourselves in Auschwitz. We came in 1944, in July. By the middle of October, it wa s a pathetic thing to look at us. We were hungry. We were beaten. We didn\u2122t have any cl othes. I worked in a detail where they took us out to a river to cut underbrush because it was the beginning of underground activities in Auschwitz and people were escapin g, so in order to clear the view for the watchtowers, there was marshland, so they took us out to work there. And I still have my shoes on my feet that I came in, which were good shoes, and I remember I left the shoes \u0152 I was working in the marshes and I sunk to my feet, and I came out of it with the tops of the shoes because the bottom were so rotten already that they got stuck in that mud. And it was October, and I was strong when I came in, you know. People that were good \u0152 they were all good. There were no bad people because we really had to depend on one another so much that nobody had much, but still, if they saw you in that situation that you really needed help, they were trying to assist you. So, I remember coming back in from work and it was very cold, and somebody gave me clogs, wooden clogs, and I couldn\u2122t walk in them. They were rubbing my feet and I walked barefoot, and it was just horrible. And when we came to the barracks, somebody gave me a regular boot, which was a very good, laced up boot. It was too big for me. It mu st have been a man\u2122s shoe, but all she had was that one boot so she gave it to me and then somebody else gave me a high heeled pump, ladies\u2122 shoes. It\u2122s a f unny story. It was ridiculous, but if you think in terms of the situation I found myself in. Oct ober, which is very, very cold, and you have to stand \u0152 it\u2122s an uphill, and you can stand with bare feet because you\u2122ll have pneumonia, plain and simple. So, I was like this, one leg up a nd one leg down. It was funny. We laughed, but I wasn\u2122t cold, and those days were kind of very, very bad. There was an underground activity already. The Nazi supervisors were very aware of someth ing going on in camp, and due to the fact that there were speci al work details where they employed only Christian Poles who were political prisoners, they were afraid th at by leaving them on their own, that they would establish a contact with the underground activities, I mean, those who were with the underground, and there\u2122s going to be an uprising. This was the time when the front was nearing, of course, because we were moved to Auschwitz from the ghetto to, at the time when the Russian fo rces were already close to Warsaw, but the front didn\u2122t move until later on in the fall, a nd for this reason, you know, we remained in Auschwitz. Here, the Nazis were afraid of the underground activities, of the Russian front approaching and everything, so they came to th e conclusion that they ought to take and break up the Polish work details \u0152 work units and bring some Jews in for them not to be as comfortable and not to be able to do the work that they were afraid of, as far as uprising. We were supposed to go to work one morning and the barracks were administered by three people. There was a Block \u00c4lteste, and there was her assistant, and there was a Shreiberin, who was a secretary kind of, who was counting the people in the morning when they went to work, and counting the people in the evening, and they were all old-timers. Do you know what I mean? Ol d-timers is that they were brought, for example, the Czech \u0152 the two girls, the Block \u00c4lteste and the assistant, was from Slovakia 38 and their transport was, I think, the very early transport, because one of them was so horrible. She was so horrible. She was just so full of hate for everything and everyone that she was just so rude and she \u0152 the Nazis didn\u2122t have the Aufsehers, who were overseeing the work and who were taking, and the guards were taking us to work did not have to worry about so much about punishing us, because half of the job was done by this particular woman. I mean, she \u0152 on the one hand, you know, I can think of her as suffering so much for two and a half years prior to our arrival or two years, whatever it is, and the first group, I think, was of 500 women and very few su rvived. So, she must have lost everybody who dear and near to her, and therefore, you know, she was afflicting all her anger and the pain on everybody who was coming, and to be tough and rough kind of gave her the security of the job indoors. She didn\u2122t have to go to work, and the story that I have to read is kind of describing of wh at life was like in one day, because I called it \ufb01One Ordinary Day in Auschwitz.\ufb02 So, anyhow why I\u2122m talking about it is because by then this Sonderkommando had uprising, one of the crematoriums was damaged, and the Nazis came to the conclusion that most of the gas chambers should \u0152 no, most of the crematoriums should be dismantled because there is \u0152 they don\u2122t \u0152 I mean, the front is so close and they didn\u2122t want to leave any evidence. And, this woman who was the secretary of the block went with a report to the main offices, because after each counting in the morning and in the evening, she had to report to the headquarters on the amount of the people who was in the barrack because food wa s allocated on this basis. And, usually we went to work, you know, and we had not seen her. On that particular morning, she returned immediately and she kind of walk ed over where we were like nine people sleeping in my section, in an upper berth, and I was like close to the end, and she pulled me and she says, \ufb01Take your two sisters a nd follow me and don\u2122t say a word.\ufb02 So, I mean, she was a Polish girl, and when we came to Auschwitz, she asked us where we are from, and I told her, and we had, knew some people \u0152 she had some friends who came to live in our town before the war, and they lived in the neighborhood. So, kind of there was a little bit of a contact right there that we had established. And she says, \ufb01Don\u2122t say a word. Take your sisters and follow me.\ufb02 So, I pull my sisters and I say, \ufb01Let\u2122s follow.\ufb02 We follow her and we come to where the main office is and there on that big square are woman, maybe a hundred, well-dressed in good ga rments, jackets, decent shoes, I mean not \u0152 I mean well-dressed in the sense that they had good clothes on. You know, they had a warm jacket and a warm skirt or whatev er and good shoes on, and here we come in shreds, and I come with the high-heeled s hoe and a combat boot, what I called it, and there was a German and she says like this, \ufb01I cannot be with you. Go join the group of the women. There is going to be \u0152 they need 20 women or 22 women\u2013\ufb02 I don\u2122t remember, it\u2122s around 20, but 21, 22, it\u2122s not important. \ufb01\u2013to work in offices. Remember, whatever she asks you whether you know, you do know,\ufb02 and she says, \ufb01And, Renia\u2122s going to stay here with me. And, you go with Hania.\ufb02 I mean, \ufb01The two of you go.\ufb02 That\u2122s what she said to us. So, we go and we have a dress on. We don\u2122t have any undergarments whatsoever. In Auschwitz, we did not get any undergarments. Whatever entlausung, you know we went through that, how do you call it, entlausung, the process of getting rid of the lice, when they took you to the shower room, and they took off your clothes and dumped it in a big vat of di sinfectant water and they dried it somewhere, I don\u2122t know 39 where, and when you came out from the show er the threw at you a garment regardless whether it was something that fits you or doesn\u2122t fit you. You know, we were running nude through the whole camp to go through to that shower room, and then of course, fortunately, you know, we managed, because we used to look at each other and kind of whoever was taller has exchanged the dress or whatever was thrown at you with a person that could wear it. And so in this respect, the whole group was aware and very cooperative; but never undergarments. At th e time, when we came in, we had nothing, outright nothing. So, I\u2122m in a dress. I can remember a long cotton dress and these shoes, and we are standing with my si ster. We looked like two set of stepsisters, like Cinderella next to the stepsisters, who were always so dressed up. And, I think to myself, \ufb01How in the world are we going to get a job here?\ufb02 And, that SS man who came to look for workers walks through the group. He told us to line up, you know, and we lined up and I was standing next to my sister and he\u2122s as king my sister what kind of qualifications she has for an office job and she speaks German ve ry well, and she says that she worked in the office when we were in camp and Father was working in the arbeitsamt, whenever there was no transport and he couldn\u2122t mana ge to have all the lists for the following morning, one of us always went to assist him so that he could \u0152 you know, he was not a young man anymore. I mean, he wasn\u2122t an old man, but you know, being alone and so forth, it was very difficult. So, we kind of were acquainted with office work. So, my sister tells him yes, yes, whatever he\u2122s asking her, whether she can do this and this, and she says yes, yes, and she speaks a very fluent German, and fine. So, he tells her to go here, and he is asking. I just happened to be next to her, but there were other women before her. So, he puts one on this side, one on this side, one on this side, one on this side. Then he says to me, \ufb01Do you know how to type on a shreibeshim?\ufb02 \u0152 on a typewriter. So I look at him, and I say, \ufb01Ich bein eine sehr gute machinenschreiberin.\ufb02 And, whatever. And, he looks at me, and he waves to go next to Hania. So, I figured okay, whatever\u2122s going to happen isn\u2122t going to matter, but I\u2122m next to my sister and everything is okay. And, he goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, then he looks at our group and he starts counting and he says, \ufb01Genug.\ufb02 And he tells everybody go, and we all went, which genug means enough. So, he counted and we were 20 \u0152 I don\u2122t know 20, we were 20 or 25. Whatever we were, but this was the number because we were to replace 25 Polish political pris oners in that work group that was dealing only with property that was brought to camp by polit ical prisoners. The political prisoners\u2122 property, whether it was a dress a sweater a hairpin, when they were taken, put in Auschwitz concentration camp and given a uniform, every little item they brought with them had to be registered and stored, so in case they were transferred to a different camp, that each and every item had to follow them or, if they died, that their property was returned to the family. So, they had to keep a very close account of the property of the women political Polish prisoners. While the property of the Jews who were brought to camp, to Auschwitz, was confiscated, and the goo d things were stored in Kanada, which was this unit known, you know, where they stored the stuff, and selected the good things to be sent to the Reich, including all valuables and everything, and the rest of the things were distributed to the prisoners, you know, when they ran out of uniforms. So, we are there and he\u2122s just about to march us off, and I know already but we are qualified for the 40 job. Now, the job is not anymore where we have been. The job is all together in a different area and very close to Kanada and we are being m arched out somewhere else, and my sister Renia is not with us. And, then I see fellows standing in the back with my sister Renia, and the Block \u00c4lteste , the woman who was in charge of the block, and they kind of push my sister Renia and the Block \u00c4lteste comes running with her and she says to the man who was selecting the people for work, she says, \ufb01Please take her with you. Her two sisters are there, and she can make a very good Lieferant (ph)\ufb02 A Lieferant (ph) due to the fact that there were no phones in camp, only the headquarters had phones, any messages that had to be carried between ba rracks were done by people who were the so-called runners between the - how do you say that? \u0152 those who, that made it possible for the barracks to communicate with the main o ffice and other departments. But, \ufb01She\u2122s a very good Lieferant (ph),\ufb02 and he looks at her and he sees the pathetic -looking thing and he looks at us, and he says, \ufb01Okay.\ufb02 And, he pounds and he marches us off. Now, we are coming to the new place to work, and there is no room for us yet because the other women whom we are replacing are still there. They have not been transported to another place and it is their job to acquaint us with the work that they have been doing. So, as we were entering, the girl who stood guard to the entrance of Kanada, a little girl whose name was Fela (ph), she saw the difference between the other women, the way what they looked like, and us, and she knew that this is like, you know, like something non-existent, because the people who worked in Kanada, they have access to food because the food was brought with the transport. So, it\u2122s not really that \u0152 it was confiscated. It was taken out of the trains. It was brought to Kanada , anyhow. So, they had good clothes and they had \u0152 so, as we were walking by she says, at break, she says, \ufb01You come to me. I\u2122ve got to see you.\ufb02 So, we nodded our heads and we said, \ufb01Fine. We are going to come.\ufb02 You know, in a situation like this, when you see that somebody wants to see you, you knew that somebody wants to see you for a different reason, for an important one, let\u2122s put it this way. So, at break, we went to the barracks and by then, she had a whole crew waiting for us. She had good coats, painted with a red stripe, because if you didn\u2122t have a uniform, a striped uniform, you had a red stripe painted on the back. So, they took us like to a little enclosure. There were four women. I never saw th em in my life including that little girl who stood at the gate. They dressed us with everything, panties and bras and socks and shoes and skirts and jackets, took off our numbers from the tattered clothes and put them on the new jacket, because we had to return back to the barracks that same day. There was no room for us to stay here. Well, we worked all day. We got acquainted with the job. It was a job inside, office work, \ufb01o ffice\ufb02 quote, unquote, but still it was indoors, and working indoors made a great deal of a diffe rence, and we went back to the barracks, to the original barracks to the group from Starachowice, and when we came in nobody could recognize us, nobody. Because we looked so different. We had all these clothes and everything. So, you know what we did? We undr essed and we shared our clothes. Mind you, three people \u0152 everybody had something di fferent of a different size. We took everything that we had on and gave it \u0152 shared it with the people who were in the barracks because we knew that we are going back the next morning and the girls told us, \ufb01Don\u2122t be afraid to leave thos e things to anyone you want to. We\u2122ll have new things for you tomorrow.\ufb02 They didn\u2122t know that we were going to be back and forth, but they 41 knew that for one week, we\u2122ll be moving around because it was a small area, you know, it was kind of a camp that was pretty m uch se parated from the rest of the camp, and they knew that it would take about a week before the other women who were training us for the job will leave. So, that was such a blessing because within this week, in the morning, we were leaving the barracks in the worst clothes there was, and coming back in the evening, and we went through the same routine every day. And, you know, it was just the most wonderful thing. We didn\u2122t help muc h. The group was, I don\u2122t know how many we were, about 200, and you can do just so mu ch, but somebody has gotten something, you know, that was helpful, and that was the most wonderful thing. There you are. Here is a woman that we don\u2122t know, that was a kind of a, you know, an acquaintance that you run into, and just a conversation with a person that you know some people that she knows or that she was fond of who were from her homet own, and that was all. I mean it was not a friendship of any kind. She was not even willing to show any kind of friendly association because, in order for her to keep her job, she was a barker is what I call her. She never hit anybody like the other one, but she barked. She was yelling and yelling and calling you the worse names in the world, but this is about the extent of her being tough. This was her toughness, and when she had this opportunity, mind you, and to be there and then to go and bring the Block \u00c4lteste to make sure that Renia\u2122s goi ng to get in with us, a miracle, that\u2122s my mother watching over us, and I\u2122m not kidding, because after the war when I returned back to Poland and I went to see my hometown to find out if there is anybody left from the family \u0152 because peop le were coming, maybe somebody was seeing, somebody had, and there were about twenty Jews who had come back and settled back in their homes in one area, but the Paliszewski family, with whom my parents were so friendly, with whom we had kind of always a home away from home, insisted that since they didn\u2122t see us for such a long time, that we can stay a whole day with the people, but for the night we should come to them and we should spend the night with them and they\u2122ll give us an opportunity to talk and, one of the women, I had a picture of her with me when I went back to Poland, you know, when we went to Treblinka, she went with us. That was in fact a finding mission in 1979. She said to us in 1945 \u0152 I was with my sister Hania in their home and I sat around and I coul d see the Christmas tree, the corner where the Christmas tree was and all the presents that they prepared for us. You know, they didn\u2122t have small children, so, you know, that whole fun of the holiday, we were their children. So, it was kind of coming back, and sh e says to me, \ufb01I want you to remember my children. Two days before the liquidation of the ghetto, your mother was here. She brought with her your Passover silver, and your Passover wine cups, and she said, \u201aI know that I cannot burden you with any property, but if you don\u2122t mind, I would like you to hold them. I know that we have almost no chance to survive, but I am willing to give my life with the knowledge that my thr ee girls will survive the war.\ufb02 And, you know, since what we had in 1945, right after the war, and I feel that all the difficult situations that we went through, in moments where we really felt that it\u2122s the end, we reached a point of no return, that it was really my mother who was wa tching over us. It\u2122s a miracle how three young girls, with such a difference in age between the oldest and the youngest, could hold on and go through the same period, and yet survive. So, I feel that it\u2122s not only that, you know, some people say divine provide nce. I believe in divine providence, you 42 know? But at the same time, I also feel that these last words that the Paliszewski\u2122s who were her friends had heard from her were so true, and the m other went down and she brought me the silver and the wine cups, the Pa ssover wine cups that I still have. This is the only thing I have from home, because ever ything else that was placed with different people are gone, and thing, you know, there were some things that they had taken that were not such a tremendous responsibility. They didn\u2122t want to take anything of value, because they figured in case they are compe lled to leave their home, they shouldn\u2122t have this obligation to worry about our property. So, the warm sweaters and the coats that we left with them because, once we went to work and we were coming back to the ghetto, we met with Polish people at work, and if we knew people who were willing to take a message to them, they have seen to it that something was sent to us, even in this slave labor camp in Starachowice, even after th e ghetto, you know. Even, they could, whatever they could afford to send us and assist us in any way they were very, very helpful. But you had to have willing people who took the messa ge to them, and trust them so that they would not endanger the safety of the famil y. So, you had to be very, very careful, and that\u2122s the way it is. But that very night when we were in Starachowice, let me finish this \u0152 is there were about 20 Jews and five children who survived Auschwitz from my hometown, and they were coming back to town , and in the middle of the night a group of radical Poles, and there were many of them in this particular region, the NSZ, the most radical, not Communist, but fascist group in Starachowice, attacked that community, that little group of people who were there, and two of those children that survived Auschwitz were killed that night, two adults, I think \u0152 I don\u2122t remember exactly. I know that there is a record made of the amount of people who we re injured, even with the names, I didn\u2122t commend it to my memory, just recollecting. I know that there were five children who survived Auschwitz and two of them were killed that ve ry night. That was June 1945. And then they came knocking at the door at the Paliszewski\u2122s house, and they said, \ufb01Open the door.\ufb02 It was like two o\u2122clock in the morning. And they said, \ufb01We know that the Laks sisters are here with you, and we want them.\ufb02 And, the lady of the house, who was in the other bedroom, and \u0152 because the friends were basically her young daughters, she was a widow by then \u0152 walked over to the door and she said, \ufb01How dare you to disturb my sleep. Yes, they are with me, but as long as they\u2122re under my roof you are not going to lay your hands on them, and please leave us alone.\ufb02 You know, they were a very respected family. I mean, they weren\u2122t just anybody. They were a very respected family. So, it was quiet and we didn\u2122t know what happened. We just knew that somebody was knocking in the middle night, demanding that we are, so to say, given to for whatever reason they wanted us. And, the following morning, one of the young women, before she went to work, went to find out what happened that night, and she came running back. She was like a ghost, as pale as a ghost, and she says, \ufb01Girls, please don\u2122t leave the house, just stay here. There is something terrible that has happened, and the people who were here looking for you have attacked that sma ll group of Jews.\ufb02 And, she didn\u2122t have the exact number or anything, but \ufb01there are people and children killed, and just stay until the situation clears.\ufb02 And, we stayed there for the whole day, and in the evening, when she came back from work \u0152 they lived also very cl ose to the railroad station, within walking distance. It wasn\u2122t that far away. She came \u0152 in a small town everything is close. So, she 43 came from work and she went straight to th e station and she bought tickets for us to go back to Lodz because w e just came for the day to find out what\u2122s happening, and for the train, she knew exactly when the train will be coming, and she asked the man who was \u0152 the head of Doroszka. You know what the Doroszka is? It\u2122s like a horse and buggy that you put the hood up to protect himself from \u0152 like in Central Park they have those buggies \u0152 and she placed us, when we heard the whistle of the train in the distance \u0152 she took us into Doroszka, covered up, took us to the train station was when the train was already standing on the track, put us in the train, and was waiting there until the moment the train started to move, to ascertain that we are safe, and that we can live in safety. And this is how I left Starachowice, and promised myself never to retu rn. It\u2122s again, we are talking about things that we are jumping back and forth, but it\u2122s\u2013 I don\u2122t know. I think that talking about the things that are very important at certain particular moments is better then to kind of go in a chronological order that I may forget later on to speak about it. And, by the way, that job lasted from the e nd of October and until the middle of January, which was two and a half months, and that wa s two and a half months in an environment that was working under the roof, in the comp any of very intelligent Polish women, and after the war, I found out that 50 percent were Jews, Jewish woman under assumed Christian names, that showed you concern and care and shared with you the packages they were getting from home and created, not only a home environment for you, but a kind of an intellectual environment, as well, where after work, because we were a small group of 50, it must have been 25 women, because we were a small group of 50, we didn\u2122t have to stand and Z\u00e4hlappel. Everything was right there within this unit, which was separate and apart from anything that was going on in Auschwitz. We were only responsible for clothes and the suitcases and the pocketbooks and everything that was brought by the Polish political prisons. So, in the evening, we used to sit and discuss and talk and sing and kind of create a kind of a lighter situation, and also having a little extra food and not being outdoors working in Nove mber and December, when conditions were horrible, outright horrible, or be transported like everybody else to another camp at the time, you know, they were mostly transporting people to different camps, and us they kept until the very last moments when the liquidating completely, abandoning Auschwitz. So, in a way those two and a half months gave us self-esteem, brought us back to kind of a little bit of a normal life. We had a little bit of extra food, and we had this group of women who were not as\u2013 desperate. I mean, th ey were political prisoners, they suffered. They suffered. They were not treated, you know, a lot better than the Jews, but the mere fact that we didn\u2122t have to go with the command and morning count, and we didn\u2122t have the dogs, and we didn\u2122t have the \u0152 no, the SS that led us to work, no \u0152 the soldiers who were watching us, you know, and we didn\u2122t walk in the rain, and we didn\u2122t stand in the rain \u0152 that whole combination kind of gave us an opportunity to kind of become human again. Human in a sense that if you regained a little bit of your se lf-esteem, because you were not beaten, and you were treated like an equal and you were not called those horrible names that sounded so terrible for a 15-year-old person, to be beaten and be called a whore and stuff like this, that I wouldn\u2122t even have dared to bring it out in the presence of my parents, expressions like this, and this is what was, so to say, a daily routine. So, this kind of a thing was really a turning point that prepared us for the death 44 march and then for all these next six months that were not so good, but on the other hand, they were not so terrible that we gave up hope. So, you know, it\u2122s like a good month and a bad month, and a good period and a bad period, and if you combine it all together and you have this support, so to say, of someone that loves you and you love them and you are aware of the fact that you have to help each other, I think that this is a secret of survival."

            "question": "What I\u2122d like us to do is start with your \u0152 a few months before the liquidation of the ghetto. Somebody had escaped from Treblinka and came back. Can you talk about w hat happened?",
            "answer": "Yes, of course. That was about in the summer of 1942 when transports to Treblinka were being sent en masse from Warsaw ghetto. They just started the evacu ation of ghettos, and I think it was Warsaw that was the first one \u0152 the first transport. It was like, I would say, September \u0152 not September, but August 1942, when on one afternoon, we were sitting in the backyard with some friends talking, spe nding some time together, when all of a sudden out of the bushes, a young man appeared and he was very disheveled. He was unshaven and he was filthy, and he was very, very frightened. And when he saw us, he wasn\u2122t quite certain whether he should come out or not, but when he saw us, he somehow dared to come out and say, \ufb01 Amhat\ufb02 (ph). Amhat was like a password at the time for making sure that the people you\u2122 re encounter are also Jews. Actually, we used to say not amhat, but amhut, with a \ufb01u\ufb02. I mean like, and of course, we answered immediately \ufb01Amhut\ufb02 to him, and this kind of got him a littl e relaxed, but he was still, very, very nervous and he was just so strange looking. We had never seen anybody in this kind of a condition. We asked him who he was and he started to tell us this story how he came with his parents to Treblinka, how they were brought on the transport to Treblinka, and how his parents were separated from him immediat ely upon arrival, how he was put to work to unload the belongings of the people that were brought to camp, and how he realized that that was the end of the road, so to say, that it was an extermination camp. So, he somehow managed after the work to get under a cattle car and he suspended himself, I mean, he went under the cattle car, got a hold of the axis \u0152 whatever \u0152 and when the train started to roll out, because the trains were bringing in pe ople, unloading and leaving the camp site, going back for more transport, he got himself under the car and held on to the chassis and when he realized that the train was already out of the camp compound, that he dropped to the ground. It was already evening, and he remained lying there on the tracks for a while to ascertain that nobody was around, that he was not going to be pursued and he walked to the woods nearby, not knowing exactly where he was and which direction to take, and he just walked, and he walked mostly at night because during the day he was frightened. He didn\u2122t know r eally, you know, what kind of a situation he may be confronted with. Therefore, he walk ed at night which was very difficult for him to know exactly where he was going, but it didn\u2122t really matter. All he wanted was to escape, and it was, like, on the second day or the third day that he came to us and he was very hungry and very thirsty and he asked for some food. We sat there, you know, we were teenagers, and we watche d him, and he himself wasn\u2122t much older. He must have been seventeen or eighteen years old, and he had that wild look on him, you know. We 46 knew something shocking \u0152 he must have gone through something very, very shocking. So, we went home and entered the house, and we told my parents that there is a guy there who acts like crazy, and he\u2122s telling us stories that we just don\u2122t believe. So, my parents came out and asked him to come in, and he sat down. They gave him some food to eat and then they started a conversation, and once he got into details my parents told us to leave. Most likely, they didn\u2122t want us to be aware or know exactly the details that were taking place, you know, in camps like Treblinka. So, I would say that after this encounter we kind of began to realize that something is happening, that inasmuch as living in the ghetto was so different from the normal life th at we led before, and being forced to work in factories was also someth ing that we have never planned on doing, especially forced labor. There was another aspect to our lives that was unpredictable that may come into the picture soon, and of course, within a few months which was from August to October, our town has gone through the same thing. The Nazis came to liquidate our ghetto in Starachowice; that was in October of 1942."

I don\u2122t know whether both of my si sters were there, one of my sisters was there, but this is what happened at the time, and this is how we came to know that there is a camp, an extermination camp, at Treblinka where they are gassing Jews."

            "answer": "We kind of sensed something, but you really don\u2122t want to believe it, and it\u2122s ma ybe, you know, a mature mind can comprehend much better then a young person. And sometimes in a lot of cases, even grown ups didn\u2122t want to believe. People sometimes would say, \ufb01Well, it must have been such a shocking e xperience for an individual to be separated from his parents, not knowing where they are or what has happened to them that all of a sudden they lose their mind.\ufb02 So, you can\u2122t rea lly tell. To us, the story was very, very strange. You know, when you believe in humanity and you believe in goodness and you are brought in a way that you have to conduct yourself properly and behave in a certain way, those things are unbelievable because things like this were never done before, even if you grew up in an environment that was anti-Semitic does not mean that you were being murdered. There hasn\u2122t been such a thi ng before. So, considering that we were all too young yet, one on hand it seemed crazy on the other hand, it was very real, because 47 the manner he ate that potato that was gi ven to him \u0152 I m ean, we shared with him whatever we had \u0152 that he was gulping it down. You could see how hungry he was."

            "question": "The day of the liquidation of the ghett o, do you reme mber what kind of a day it was? Was it cold? Was the sun shining?",
            "answer": "This, too, has been a different experience for me and my older sister than for anybody else because, as I said before, we were working in a factory and that was the brick factory that we were working. Usually, there were two shifts, so it was a twelve hour working shift, and that very day, we left for work for the night shift. So, actually what happened is that like the day before, we left home, and went to work without knowing that that was the last time that we were together as famil y, that it was the last time that we had seen our mother, and it was the last time that we functi oned as a family unit, because the night of \u0152 while we were in the factory, SS groups with collaborators from \u0152 they were uniformed Latvian soldiers \u0152 came to liquidate the ghetto. They took all the people out, chased everybody out of their homes into the marketpl ace, and there was a selection. The people who had employment cards were put to one side. People who were without employment cards \u0152 children, and elderly and mothers \u0152 they were put to another side, and they were beaten, of course, and those who remained in their homes who refused to leave the house were shot to death either in their beds or at home. So, everybody was out in the marketplace in the middle of the night, and my sister and myself were at work in the factory. So, actually only Renia and both of my parents were there while the action took place. So, the details that I know of what has happened at the time came from my sister Renia and from my father. The replacement for the shift on which we were did not arrive in the morning to the factory because they were still segregating people. Therefore, we had to remain in the factory for another twel ve hours of work. So, we worked that day a double shift, and we didn\u2122t know what happened. We just couldn\u2122t understand, and in the morning, the factory was like on the ground floor, and on the upper levels were offices, and in one of the \u0152 in the office there was a school friend of mine, a Christian, a Pole, who lived not far in the neighborhood and he knew the Jews are working two shifts. He didn\u2122t know who was at work, and he came a little earlier and he came down and he says, \ufb01Something horrible happened in town. They are taking away the Jews.\ufb02 And, he looked and when I saw him, I walked over and I said, \ufb01Tell me what happened.\ufb02 So, he says, \ufb01Come up to the window upstairs and you will see it by yourself.\ufb02 The window was facing a railroad siding from where the cattle cars where standing and where the people were brought from the marketplace, and of c ourse, it was such a shock, when I looked out the window, that I will never forget it because the people were crying, they were beaten, they were chased. You could see mothers, you know, holding their babies. You could see men carrying bundles on their backs, and for th at fleeting moment, fo r that minute or two, whatever, because I didn\u2122t want to jeopardize his job, and he for sure, you know, wouldn\u2122t want to anyone to realize that he made it possible for me to come and look out the window. So, for that one moment, all I could see was like a chain of human bodies moving in one direction, you know, beaten and pushed into the cars, and I was trying so hard to look and see whether I see a familiar f ace, I couldn\u2122t see anything. I just couldn\u2122t 48 see, whether it was because I was so shocked, or because I was \u0152 I me an, it was too far of a distance for me to see, but just a feeling of that mass of people being driven and being pushed into the cars and listen to the crie s and the moaning and it was horrible. I came back to work \u0152 you know, we worked the conveyor, like a conveyor where we were placing wet bricks on the conveyor belt and they were sent to the kiln upstairs \u0152 and I knew that something has taken place. I only hope that whatever has taken place, that it will bring us back together. That was the mo rning. We came after work, they never took us back to the ghetto. They took us to the camp in Majowka, and there we found Father, and we found Renia, and Mother was not around. They just couldn\u2122t find Mother anywhere. But Mother was employed in an electric plant, which at the time had it\u2122s own facility, like a little small barracks for the people who worked around there. So, we were hoping that, due to the fact that this was her place of employment, that she could have been taken to the other facility, and it took a whole week to inquire. You know, it wasn\u2122t so easy to make contact. It took a whole w eek to inquire who was sent where, you know, which camp, because there were three camps. There were the camps Strzelnica and then Majowka, and this was the electric plant, which eventually, you know, they took the people from the electric plant and brought them to one of the two camps. And we found out that Mother wasn\u2122t around. And talking to people afterwards, trying to find out what happened to Mother, we were told that she had a friend who was a widow and she was all by herself, and she got very hysterical b ecause she had nobody and she was so lost, and Mother kept her company and she tried to keep her calm, and she told her \ufb01Don\u2122t worry, I\u2122m with you. I\u2122m with you; I\u2122m going to take care of you.\ufb02 So, she took care of her and they both went to Treblinka, just to show th at she died the way she did, trying to help other people. This was 1942. So, she was the first victim in the family, so to say, and I have difficulties to kind of understand why a person who has done so much good for others has been taken away from us, and sh e was the first victim. We came to the camp. Of course, the group was not sent immedi ately to the camp. We had to go through inspection. They had to check what we had on us. Not that we carried a lot to work with us, but due to the fact that my parents met that young men at the time, Mother insisted, especially since it was getting a little colder, that we wear three outer layers of clothes and good shoes that we have a good coat when we go to work because normally, she wouldn\u2122t have even thought about it. So, we came in and, of course, whatever we had, a watch or whatever, a little ring, or whatever \u0152 what does a teenager have? \u0152 it was taken away from us, and we remained with the clot hes at least we had, some extra clothes to wear and we had good shoes on our feet. So, they took away the valuables from us and they placed us in different, different, in the barracks. There was barracks for men and there were barracks for women, and then the following day, they separated the group, because the people who worked in the munition factories went to the camp at Strzelnica, which was much closer to the factory, while th e rest of us went to Majowka, which was a larger camp, and from there people were sent to many different places of employment, whether they needed in the steel mill, whet her they were needed in the brick factory where I was in the beginning or whether in the electric plant or wherever. So, this is \u0152 we were separated. Father and I had remained in Majowka, and Hania and Renia were sent to Strzelnica, and as I mentioned to you that due to the fact that Father was running that 49 employment office in the ghetto, he was put in ch arge because he was familiar with the work in Majowka, and Hania was assigned the same job in Strzelnica. Whatever Father was doing in Majowka, she was running the office there and the work usually \u0152 I mean, the assignment of the work came from the Je wish management, came from the Judenrat which was very, very helpful because at least, you know, we had more contact with her, and it was easier to maintain the contact be tween one camp site and the other. So, that was the liquidation of the ghetto. It was such a sad sight. I must have been at the window for a minute or maybe for two, but to just watch that like moving bodies, you know, a group, a chain, an unending chain, and we were \u0152 I don\u2122t know whether we were five thousand Jews, or - usually it was like ten percent of the population in a small town like ours was Jewish \u0152 and Wierzbnik and Star achowice were two communities, separate communities until the consolidation. So, Wierzbnik was predominately Jewish, and I would say that there must have been, I don\u2122t know, at least five thousand Jews living in the community. Fortunately, because of the need for employment and the Jews were working free of charge, you know. There was no pay or no compensation whatsoever for work. We were magnificent cheap labor force, that a lot of people were saved from \u0152 especially those who were young and able to work, and survived due to the fact that from 1942 until 1944, until the time when they took us to Auschwitz, that we were working. And of course, the mere fact that you liv ed in the same comm unity and that you knew people, Christians and in some cases, Christ ians who were willing to assist you on their very own, and in some cases, Christians with whom some people left valuables, and they were kind of disposing of the valuables and helping and sending to the people some extra food or some clothes or whatever they needed. So, that was very helpful because those people \u0152 those Jews were brought from large Lo dz or from Plotsk or from the other places, in the beginning to our ghetto, they had nobody to assist them. They had nobody to help them. They were total strangers and they depended on the assistance of the Jewish community, but once the Jewish community was decimated, they didn\u2122t have anyone to turn to."

Somehow in the back of my mind, I was hoping that, no matter what, that Mother is going to somehow appear. We all knew \u0152 we all knew that what is happening when people are taken away from the ghettos.

That maybe by some chance they wound up in a camp somewhere and maybe after the war you w ill be reunited. From what we heard, is that she was put on the train with her friend, and everybody knew that the train went straight to Treblinka. So, inasmuch as, on the one hand, we knew what has happened, on the other hand, in my own mind, I was still hoping that a good person like her deserves to live."

            "question": "One of the reasons why I ask you that que stion is because, when people in ordinary circumstances in normal life lose somebody, the time of the funeral and the mourning is a time when \u0152 people need a certain kind of time. But in traumatic situations and in situations like you were in, there is no time. So, there is no space.",
            "answer": "There is no time. There is no space. There is no assurance that this is what happened, and that it happened when it did happen. But one thing was certain: when the war was over and the people who survived from the community got together and they kind of gathered 51 all the information that was available, everybody knew that the transport from Starachowice wound up in Treblinka. Treblinka nowadays is a very kind of very awesome place where you don\u2122t have any barracks, and you don\u2122t have any crematoriums. It\u2122s just an architectural artistic, architecturally interpretation which received the prize from the Polish government , and what it consists of is huge rocks and little rocks that are supposed to represen t communities from which the people were brought for extermination, and there is a huge , huge stone \u0152 not a granite stone, but a whatever the stone is, with the carved na me on it \ufb01Starachowice\ufb02 and it\u2122s huge. It\u2122s almost up to my shoulder. And every time I go to, to Poland, I make my way to Treblinka with a little flower. That st one is the only thing that I have to remember Mother, just remember her and remember the people who, our neighbors and our friends and everybody else who lived around and found the same fate as she did. So, you have to make peace and you have to go on living. It\u2122s really tragic because it\u2122s not only my mother, but think of all the wonderful people who lived in the community and think of all the little children and they did not survive the war because of the Nazi madness. [pause] Then, of course, we had to be confronted with another thing. We went to work every day just like before, but the living conditions were different. As long as we were in the ghetto, we had a family life, not as comfortable as be fore, but still in all we were a family unit and that was very, very important. Here, we were separated. My two sisters were somewhere else, and I was with my father so mewhere else. We maintained our contact, which was wonderful, and due to the fact that, as I said before, we were in our hometown and we knew the people who were involved, who were assigned to different jobs, you know, in administrating the camp, but if anythi ng we needed very badly; they were always cooperating. But, life was all together different. We lived in barracks. The food was prepared in the kitchen. So, we had to have the meal whenever it was available. We didn\u2122t starve, not like in Auschwitz, but we certainly get enough food, but in comparison with Auschwitz, the slave labor camp, was much, much better and you kind of have to accept whatever the situation was like."

            "question": "Where did you eat? In the barracks, or\u2013?",
            "answer": "No, there was like a mess hall near where the kitchen facility was, and they were preparing meals for people as they were coming and leaving for work, you know? So, there was an advantage to that because Father was always waiting for me to return from work so we could have a meal together. In asmuch there was separate area where the barracks for men were situated and the wome n were, it\u2122s still, you know, meals we could have together. At the time, the camp, the N azi commandants who were in charge of the camps, were changing all the time. I don\u2122t know why, whether it was due to the war effort, or whether they were sent out to the front, or due to the fact it kind of was tied in with the munition factories, and depending on the job that they had to do, you know, that they were also in charge of the camp. We were guarded by Ukrainians, and the camp, inasmuch as it was a labor camp, was also fenced in and we had watchtowers, and the Ukrainian guards were in the watchtowers. We were led to work always guarded by the Ukrainians and brought back from the work. If the distance was a very long distance, 52 then they put us on trucks, and they took us to work. Otherwise, they marched us to work. Some times, the camp commandant was a kinder individual. Sometimes, it was a vicious individual. And in 1943, spring of 1943, a typhus epidemic broke out in the camp, and people got very, very sick, and they lost a lot of people. They didn\u2122t have enough people to send to the factories. Inasmuch as they were bringing more people from different smaller plants that they were liquidating. A nd I remember one day, Hania was with Renia in Strzelnica, and I was with my father and the epidemic broke out first in Strzelnica, and both of my sisters took sick, but Renia wa s first. And when the camp commandant, who was at the time, his name was Meir, and th ere was an ubershtopfuhrer (ph), who was over this camp commandant. His name was Aldoph, ca me in one day to Strzelnica, and they told everybody to leave the barracks, and w hoever remained in the beds, they were walking with machine guns, both of them, a nd shooting people who did not live the beds because they were not able to get up. And th e rest, they put outside and they told the people to run, and those who couldn\u2122t run were shot either shot on the spot or they were put on a truck and taken outside \u0152 outside of the camp to the woods and they were shot there in the woods, and then buried in a ma ss grave. And Renia was already sick with fever and Hania sent her to the laundry room where there was a lot of steam, and Renia and another friend of Renia\u2122s who was more or less her age, the two of them were told to go to the laundry room, because there nobody ca me in to look, and it was kind of steamy and hot and all that, and two days later, they told me to go over to Strzelnica because \u0152 after they took out the dead people, and they cleaned up the barracks, and I was told to go and take over the office in Strzelnica. Hania was sick and Renia was sick. So, I took care of the office and I took care of them. And it wasn\u2122t easy. It was not easy, but with God\u2122s help, they pulled through."

            "question": "Did you feed them?",
            "answer": "There wasn\u2122t that much food really, but it \u2122s water and I had the experience from taking care of my mother before. So, in a way, I was familiar with the routine what to do. I think Father got in touch with the Paliszewskis, and they send out some medication, and so this helped quite a bit. So, they got on their feet, and no sooner Hania returned back to work, and everything was well, I came back to Majo wka, and my father took sick. So, it\u2122s from one situation into the next. So, I took care of my father and, because he was working in the office, so his quarters, his living quarters, were with the head of the administration of the camp and the barber in the camp, and my fa ther and the man who was in charge of the kitchen, I think, there were four or five beds in that smaller room. So, if you was in the barracks, I wouldn\u2122t have been allowed to go into a regular barracks, bu t due to the fact that he shared this small living space with ot her people, they wanted to keep them apart from the rest of the camp to protect them from diseas es that otherwise you were susceptible when you lived with a lot of people together. So, I took care of him, and there 53 was still medication left over, and that was good. And he pulled through, and I was so pleased when the crisis was over because I was more worried about him than about my sisters. And I don\u2122t have to tell you that I was the last one, right?, to get sick. I must have been already like into the fourth day of my typhus fever when Father returned to work. And I slept \u0152 we had a women\u2122s barrack, and I had a friend who was also a neighbor, and she was like ten or fifteen years older, and she was a very meticulous person, and she always told me, \ufb01I want you to be right ne xt to me. I don\u2122t want \u0152 I don\u2122t want you to have a straw sick (ph) and I don\u2122t because the bed bugs, and their lice and everything is sitting in them. You are going to be sleeping on bare boards, just like I am, so we don\u2122t invite any problems or any diseas es and this will keep out \u0152 this way we\u2122ll keep ourselves clean.\ufb02 Her name was Fania Hershtein (ph), a nd she was really wonderful to me because she kind of taught me how to survive under such circumstances, and so we had the corner bed on the upper level. But people were going to work, so there was not all the time the same person around you, and this was the onl y place that you could stay. They had an infirmary, but who wanted to go to the in firmary. You knew that once you are going to go to the infirmary, you\u2122ll never come out, wh ether it was in our camp, the slave labor camp, or in Auschwitz. So, I was there in that corner on that bed, and I remember the last two days of my sickness. I had a terrible throbbing in my head, and the pain was right here and I felt it in my temples, and I thought that my whole head is going to just break open from that pain. I was aware of what was happening because I remember what was being done to me. On the other side of the sp ace where we slept were two sisters and they were from a village not too far away, and th ey were working on a different shift that Fania was working, and because I was crying that my head hurt so badly, one of the sisters was holding my \u0152 put her hands on my temples and was kind of pressing against my temples, holding it tight, and this seemed to be relieving that throbbing, that terrible pain, and I remember when she did it and I fe lt so comfortable, and that I felt so much better. And then I do not remember anything at all until the next day when, all of a sudden, I felt that somebody came into the barracks and pulled me out from that bed, from that spot where I slept, and put me \u0152 you see, I was like in th e corner and facing the entrance to the barracks was a window, and there was also a bed down there. Somebody pulled me out from the top, because I heard ye lling, \ufb01Everybody out of the barracks!\ufb02 and I just wasn\u2122t in a position to get out bed. I figured whatever\u2122s going to happen most likely will happen, I figured. I didn\u2122t figure \u0152 I don\u2122 t remember, but I remember that I did not leave the barracks, and somebody pulled me out and placed me somewhere else, and then I felt like straw sticks (ph) were being thrown on top of me. You know, it was like that sack filled with straw, and then I heard this German yelling, \ufb01 Aus, aus!\ufb02 That means get up, get out. And, then they came in most likel y with bayonets and the rifles because I could hear above me that poking in the sp aces to make sure that nobody is around, and then I could hear some poking in front of me, around me, but I didn\u2122t \u0152 nobody hit me and nobody hurt me. And, when the day was over, the following day, and I felt better and I was aware of what \u0152 I was told of what took place, that it\u2122s the same thing as in Strzelnica, that people were shot, those who couldn\u2122t run fast enough, and were taken away to be shot in the woods. I just couldn\u2122t figure out what happened. About eight years ago, a guy from Israel came for a visit to Vine land, and he was in charge of a federation 54 project. It was a sister city of Vineland that we were supporting in Israel, and his children were also very involved in the rehabilitation of the community. So, he was brought to Vineland to speak about what was accomp lished with the money that Vineland community was sending to Israel, and he came with the chairman of the campaign here to us because, once he knew that it was Vineland and I live in Vineland, he says, \ufb01I remember Rozka Laks. I would like to see he r.\ufb02 So, you know, when they discussed that whole idea in Israel, so he was promised th at when he comes to Vineland, he\u2122s going to see me. We were sitting at the table. I had served coff ee and cake, and his name is Penhurst Hoffnitz (ph). Unfortunately, he passed away three years ago. And he turns to me and he says like this, \ufb01Do you remember,\ufb02 he says, \ufb01during that typhus period in the camp when they came to Majowka and they to ld everybody to leave the barracks and you were so sick?\ufb02 he says. \ufb01I came to look fo r my sister, and I saw you, and I pulled you off that bed and I placed you on the lower bed, hopi ng that you will be much safer in front of the window than somewhere in the corner hiding.\ufb02 Now, this revelation was something. I mean, in front of Miles and in front of th e local chairman of the JA Campaign. It was such an unbelievable story. I knew that somebody had done something for me, but I never knew who the person was, and it was Penhurst, and I didn\u2122t know about it until he came to the United States. So, those are situ ations beyond one\u2122s control, without even knowing why they happen, how they happen, and in what circumstances they are. I don\u2122t know, I have many interpretations when I thi nk about it. When I think about Mother and her dedication and work for Israel, and this being connected with federation and Israel, I just don\u2122t know. I really don\u2122t want to get that mystical. But, I\u2122ll never forget it. I mean this is such an eye-opener. So many peopl e used to ask me, you know, after the war, many people asked me, \ufb01So, who was the pers on who did it?\ufb02 I can\u2122t remember, but somebody did it, and it was Penhurst, and you k now, it just came out so naturally. He says, \ufb01Do you remember?\ufb02 So, when people say, \ufb01How did you survive?\ufb02 Now, how do you explain what survival meant? There are no words to describe, I mean, why and how. And in what way, whether it was up to a total stranger or to a friend. When I think about it, I always feel that there must have been like an angel, a guardian angel watching over us that kept us together all three sisters throughout. I men tioned last time about Fela \u0152 Fela Berlant (ph), who made it possible for us to be transferred from Auschwitz to better working conditions. Now, Fela Berlant was a Jewish girl from home, and she didn\u2122t really know us from Adam before, and it just happened so that she made it possible to take us from the worst conditions where we were almost, so to say, reaching a point of total starvation and give us \u0152 place us \u0152 in a si tuation for the next three months that made us feel like human beings all over again, that gave us self esteem all over again, gave us the opportunity to kind of go on with what was meant to become \u0152 with the things that we were confronted with in the following mont hs, and so it\u2122s destiny, maybe, or for sure.

            "question": "Chris, you were in some ways alone with your father. I mean, there were other people around with whom you were friends, but you indi cated that your relationship with your father changed somewhat in the context of th at camp, that in some way you got closer to him then you had before. Can you describe that relationship with how you understand what happened between you?",
            "answer": "Well, Father was, so to say, the head of th e fam ily like in most European homes, and he was a disciplinarian. He was a very meticulous individual \u0152 everything had to be just perfect with him. He didn\u2122t spend much time with us when we were younger. So, basically, I only thought of him as a parental figurehead, you know, that is a parent. That we have certain responsibility as children, and he has responsibilities of a father. So, the time we spent together \u0152 I mean, the time that we experienced as children, speaking of parents were more so with my mother than with Dad. Father was away a lot from home, and when he came home he was busy also preparing the work that he was doing. And also, we were much too young for him to really be involved with us. When we got a little older, I said he was in the free time that he had with us, we were singing and we were harmonizing and we were discussing things, you know, because we were a little older, he always wanted to know what we are reading and he was kind of interested more so in our development as people rather than to give us guidance. It\u2122s Mother who did the job. And, it was during the job when we were together especially in Majowka where I was with him, that I could see him as a person, as a person who has the patience and who does care and who was loving, and who was concerned with our well-being and on occasion he mentioned Mother, I remember. But I\u2122m sure that it must have been very painful for him to speak about it. I used to always say to him that we\u2122ll find Mother, Dad, don\u2122t worry. We\u2122ll find her somewhere. She must be some where. So, I don\u2122t know whether I believed in it or whether it was just that hope, but this could have kind of encouraged him to on occasion speak about it. He was very, very bus y because he had a very responsible job. People were dying, and people were sick, and some people we re shot, and he had to provide the work force every morning, regardle ss of how many people were available. It was his responsibility. So, it\u2122s not like under normal circumstances where you get up in the morning and there you go out and the peopl e were waiting to go to work. Every once in awhile there were five missing, ten missing and he had to find them, you know? And then, of course, he had to discuss those things with the administration of the camp, the Jewish administration of the camp, and they in turn discussed it most likely with the Nazi authorities and when there was a shortage of people, people were being brought from other camps to Starachowice, to Majowka or Strzelnica. When the transports came, and a few hundred people at a time, and he had to get everything ready for the following morning because there was really, there were a few hundred people. There was really a shortage in manpower that I used to be with hi m in the office until very late to make sure that he concluded his work, because crossindexing the files and putting everything in place and who arrived and from where and who was gone and, you know, it wasn\u2122t easy for just one person to do it. So, in addition to the work that I have been doing, I have been 56 also helping him to the extent that I could. So, I had this comfort of being around him and to really get to know him. He was just a wonderful person, and because I kind of was optimistic about Mother being somewhere in li fe, that we\u2122ll someday be reunited, I guess maybe it was a comfort not only for me, but fo r him as well. We didn\u2122t have much time for fun or anything like that, but the moments that we ha d together were very, very important. You also mentioned something about culture or spending culturally the time in camp. Another kind of a semi-private facility was of the dentist, where he had his equipment that he brought from the ghetto \u0152 ac tually from his office from before the war \u0152 and all he had really was that drill that was operated with a pedal; it wasn\u2122t electric. And a chair, of course, and he didn\u2122t fill cavities, but if you had a toothache, he pulled the tooth out and that was it. So, he had this office in one barracks, a separate area. I think it was not far from the other barracks where my fa ther was. And next to it, he had his living quarters. So, in the evening on occasion, when we felt the need for some kind of a cultural thing, that was the best place to meet. So, we used to there to his office, and he had a friend, a very lovely lady. No, she was his wife! Right, Leona was his wife. And we used to get together and there were people who were singing, and there were people who were reciting poetry. So, on occasion we used to have like an evening of this nature. There was a fellow, I don\u2122t know where he was from, but he was \u0152 whether he had a singing voice or not, I don\u2122t know, but he was whistling \ufb01Zigeunerweisen\ufb02, not singing \u0152 but to a point that every note was perfect, just from the whistling. The whole thing from beginning to end, and that was the biggest tr eat of all because the music you are familiar with \ufb01Zigeunerweisen\ufb02? It\u2122s a very sentimental song. \ufb01Zigeunerweisen\ufb02 means gypsy airs, so actually there is a nostalgia for the freedom of being out in the open, you know, the life of gypsies. So, there is this beautiful music, there is the longing for the open spaces, and it was to me \u0152 it was just like putting myself into a dream world without dreaming of something beautiful. There was no fu ture whatsoever. If we could not dream, or if we could not think of pleasant things, we would not have survived. Some people were thinking forever about a good meal. Some people had different things on their mind. Most people were thinking about the family they lost, and still to be able not to give up hope and to dream was one of the important as pects of survival. So, those evenings were very, very important. We couldn\u2122t do them too often. We had to be very comfortable with ourselves and knowing that whoever was in charge, the commandant, whether he was a Ukrainian \u0152 in most cases a Ukrainian \u0152 or the commandant in charge of the camp guards, I mean, that even if he were to come in, that he would not get angry and disperse, make sure that we are punished in one way or another. So, some of them came in and they just sat around and listened."

            "answer": "I have bad dreams now a lot of times. I wa ke up and I scream \ufb01Momm a\ufb02. I mean, that\u2122s the first thing. I usually wake up, I sit up in the bed, and I scream \ufb01Momma,\ufb02 but it takes me so much to bring it out that I must be going through tortures before I bring it out. Once I bring it out, then I\u2122m awake. I dr eam about running away from dangerous situations. I feel I\u2122m being chased by the Nazis. But for one strange reason, I\u2122m always running with my two little children, with Jeanette and David as little children in my arms. I can\u2122t interpret it in any way as feeling that I have to protect my children as a parent from a dangerous situation, but basically it wa s my fears of the Nazis that my children did not have to be involved. It\u2122s maybe because, knowing that the responsibility of a parent is to guard your own children, so this is why I\u2122m always running. Quite often, you know, when people in the beginning used to ask me how come I don\u2122t have any more children, in a joking way I used to say, \ufb01Becau se I only have two arms.\ufb02 If I had a few more arms, maybe I would have more chil dren, but for running away from difficult situations when I am threatened with being in camp or being \u0152 that Nazis are always after me, I\u2122m running with my kids, two little kids."

            "question": "If you don\u2122t remember dreams, were you always tired in Majowka? Did you feel as if you got rest?",
            "answer": "No. You don\u2122t feel tired wh en you\u2122re in situations like that. You are driven. You are driven because you are driven because \u0152 actua lly, because you are driven physically by whoever supervisors the work because you have to make sure that everything is done on time. If you fall behind, you either punished or there is another whatever outcome of the situation \u0152 in most cases punishment or b eating or whatever. And when you are young, I think that you can manage a lot easier with di fficult situations than when you are older. I could see that women who were five or ten ye ars older, no more, let\u2122s say we were fifteen or sixteen, they were twenty or twenty-fiv e and they were already married or had a 58 family, and the family was taken away from th em , that they did not have that drive to survive. Especially when they were alone, if they didn\u2122t know what happened to the rest of the family. For them, life was very, very difficult, very difficult, and the working conditions were very bad. People used to work in front of machines in heat that was burning through their garments. We couldn\u2122t get other things to wear. Food wasn\u2122t adequate. Bed bugs were all over. They were falling off the ceiling in the middle of the night with like parachutes. Lice were on your body and in your clothes, in the seams of your clothes \u0152 no matter how hard you tried to maintain a certain degree of hygiene, you couldn\u2122t manage. So, you tried your very be st. We had like long troughs with running water in the barracks and outside of the barracks. So, during the summertime, we used to wash ourselves outdoors because it was so much better, but in the wintertime we used to bring the \u0152 I don\u2122t think that we had the running troughs in the barracks, but we had a pan of water and we used to wash ourselves and on occasion if anybody had contact with the outside, because when went to work in the factory, you met with the Christian population of the town, and there were people who ma ybe weren\u2122t willing to give you outright something as a gift, but they were willing to take a message to someone who was willing to help you and by getting something in return they would bring it to you to the factory. And some people even if they didn\u2122t know you at all, but they felt that if it can help you that they were willing to do it as well. So, there were all kind s of different situations. So, on occasion you had a piece of soap and so you could launder your undergarments and keep yourself clean that way. What we used to do is when we worked on the night shift in the summertime, we used to sleep outdoors instead of in the barracks during the day because \u0152 in the summertime only, not in the winter, of course, it was cold. But, we came back from work in the morning. So, we took a blanket or whatever was there on the bed and spread it out outdoors on the grass, right under the fence and we slept outdoors. So, at least we didn\u2122t have to cope with the bedbugs. It was better sleep and we got some sunshine on our bodies, got a suntan free of charge."

            "question": "And you were separated from them for a year, two years?",
            "answer": "For about a year, and then they \u0152 the situation was constantly changing depending on where they needed the labor force. So eventually, they eliminated completely the electric plant. They eliminated completely the brick factory, and they were concentrating mainly on the ammunition aspect of it, because the main production was the manufacture of shells for \u0152 anti-aircraft shells and, you know, the very large shells. So, the men worked with the big shells, and the women, you know, th ey had to be cut \u0152 I don\u2122t know how to say it in English \u0152 but they were placed like in a machine that was sized to the millimeter and there was like \u0152 it was turning the metal sh ell for the exact size to file it down to perfection, and this is was what women were doing. Also, women were working on the premises in camp, you know, cleaning the barr acks, taking care of the laundry \u0152 not personal laundry, but whatever, you know, the kitchen stuff and all that, and for example, later on, when I stopped going to the factory, to the brick factory, and I was helping Father quite often, he used to send me to work wherever there was a shortage of people. I mean, I was the standby \u0152 wherever another pe rson was needed and he didn\u2122t have it. So, this is how I was filling in, and because of that I had a very nice, very pleasant experience one time. It was like maybe two weeks before they send us to Auschwitz, an order came from the office \u0152 from the factory main o ffice \u0152 that they needed someone who knows how to type. Father didn\u2122t have a typist on hand to send to the factory. So, he says to me, \ufb01I would like you to go because it\u2122s for a da y until the find someone. They need a typist for tomorrow.\ufb02 So, he says, \ufb01Whatever you do w ill be all right. I have to send a person.\ufb02 So, I go with the group in the morning to work and they tell me where to go, and I come in and I enter this room and it has like in a cl assroom, small desks, and in front there is like a glassed in area and there is this head of the office. I don\u2122t know who he was, I never saw him in my life, in uniform you know \u0152 a Nazi \u0152 and I come in and I\u2122m very strange and I don\u2122t know where to go, and the guard who brought me in is taking me to the front right in front of the glassed in o ffice, and there\u2122s this huge, huge type machine, and with paper inserted in it and all that, and as I walk, I can hear like people call my name, and I turn here, there is a friend from school, there is a friend from school. I just didn\u2122t know whether it was real or not, and I come to that big typewriter and the German 60 comes out and he says to me do I know how to type, and I tell him yes, I do. And, he tells me that I have to prepare all this for today. So, I sat down, and fortunately he wasn\u2122t there for too long, you know, he just came to organi ze the work and make sure that everybody is at their desks, and I worked. I don\u2122t know how good I was or how bad I was. It was only for one day, so I never returned. But during a break, those two guys with whom I was in high school came running to me and they threw me up in the air. I mean, from happiness, they just picked me up and threw me like a ball, and they said, \ufb01You are alive. How wonderful to see you!\ufb02 Now, you will ask me the names of those guys. There isn\u2122t a single name I remember. I only remember that in the very back, at the last desk in that room, was my professor who taught me Latin. I couldn\u2122t stand his guts, and I don\u2122t think he liked me either, and he wanted to fail me because I didn\u2122t like him. He was teaching history for one year and then he was teachi ng Latin. And every professor in school liked me a lot and they saw a potential in me, a nd he always looked for the negative, and he always said that I am not a sincere student. And everybody else\u2013 None of the professors where really as vindictive when it came to an exam as he was. I remember when \u0152 every once in a while he\u2122d ask questions, especially vocabulary, new words \u0152 so, when I got up, he used to keep people for two minutes, for three minutes. He used to keep me sometimes for fifteen minutes. He kept me as long as I couldn\u2122t give him an answer. I used to come home and cry and Mother would say, \ufb01Look, th e only way to overcome this is for you to be very, very prepared, not just prepared. There is nothing because if he made up his mind that he\u2122s going to fail you, you better be prepared for it.\ufb02 His name was Kaifash (ph), this I remember, his name I\u2122ll remember forever, and he was sitting there in the back, and I hadn\u2122t given him the courtesy to ev en say hello or look at him. Well, he was just awful. Even the director of the Gymnasium liked me a lot and he was so helpful in getting me tutoring jobs and everything, and everybody believed in me. Just this one he wanted to fail me. So, I don\u2122t want to say he was anti-Semite maybe he had a different \u0152 whatever. Anyhow, he was the one that I wasn\u2122t even excited to see, but with the other two fellows, it was just so wonderful. And of course after that day, I never came back to this particular place of employment because most likely it was only a temporary kind of a need for whatever it was for the job, and a week later the camp was closed completely. There was a breakout from the camp at night. People tried to escape because, once they closed the camp, we knew that we are not going to be going to work anymore. So, young people cut through the fence and cut the fence and tried to get it out, and in a very short while the watchtowers noticed it, and they thre w all the reflectors in that direction and they were shooting and a lot of people were killed, a lot of people escaped, but we lived in a very wooded area where the reactionary Polish partisan groups were operating, and Jewish escapees had hardly a chance to survive, and those who were caught not only were they pursued by the Nazis and the Ukrainian guards, but the Poles hardly gave a sympathetic ear to the place of the Jews and they were sending them away if they did not turn them over to the Nazis, so a lot of people lost their lives this way. Quite a number survived. Among them was my future brothe r-in-law, Hania\u2122s husband, who was able to make it and he joined the partisan group and he survived the war."

            "answer": "No. It just, of course, people knew. If \u0152 As I me ntioned to you before, we lived in the same community. So, there were contacts to be made, whether contacts for extra food, or contacts for a garment, for a coat or a pair of shoes, or whatever. There were also contact with underground activities, and that Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa, JOB, what they called it, the Jewish Fighting Organization, was operating at the time after the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto because this was already the end of 1943. So, they were reaching out to different camps to let the people know what is happening and not to give in and if you have any way of survival, I mean, any way of escaping from camp, that this is something that you should do, and there\u2122s no doubt in my mind that there were people who knew what was going on because even the group from Krakow that I knew \u0152 Vushka Liebeskind (ph) and her husband was one of those people that were involved with the underground activities \u0152 and their main job was sending out messenger to still existing Jewish communities, whether it was in camps or in forced labor camps or even in Auschwitz, they were trying to make contact with those people and tell them to try to escape because this is the only way, and they were very instrumental in even sending false documents if you provided for them a photograph, they send a document for you. I remember, when we were asked to send photogra phs to \u0152 I mean, to make sure that we have photographs for documents, and I rememb er somehow I managed for all of us to have photographs taken and I had given it to somebody, but it was such a short period from the time when there was the breakout at camp and two weeks later, when they put us on the train to take us to Auschwitz, that we never received the documents. When I think back about it, I\u2122m not so sure if we w ould have really tried to escape. Knowing that Father is somewhere else, that he was not with us \u0152 if it was just the three of us, maybe it would have been a different situation, although for one person it was a lot easier than for three \u0152 but having Father in addition to it who, always being male was always away, a distance away, sometimes a greater distance, and sometimes a very short distance, but never together, that this would have been a good decision. And in July of 1944, they took us to Auschwitz because by then the Russian troops were already on the other side of the Vistula River and, of course, it was\u2013 by then they were liquidating most of the camps that were still in existence. Majdanek was already liberated, and the world I\u2122m sure became aware of the atrocities that were co mmitted in camps, and we were never told that we were going to Auschwitz, we just were loaded on trains and to an unknown destination. 62"

We were not allowed to \u0152 I mean, we\u2122re closed up and the people who tried to escape were either \u0152 some of them were killed on one side of the fence, some were killed on the other side of the fence, some were killed in the woods. A nd the rest of us had remained in camp, and 64 there was a woman whose husband worked in the infirmary, and she was with us, and they were from Plotzk or from another tow n.

He comes in and he brings to his wife a vial wi th cyanide, and he pulls out of the pockets several vials and he says to me, \ufb01I don\u2122t know where we are going, but I know for sure that we are going to die,\ufb02 he says. \ufb01Now, I brought it for anyone who wants it. I am going to use it myself. I am going to give it to my wife. If you want one, you can have it.\ufb02 It was a little thing, you know.

I was young and I never gave up the idea that some where, somehow there is a future for us. I believed so strongly, and I think this is what really gave us this courage to manage in the worst situations . In that world of helplessness and hopelessness, if you did not have that desire, it just \u0152 you just gave in and that was it. It \u0152 you needed courage for that. I feel that the courage that I had was fr om my two sisters and I think that they had this responsibility. We all had this responsib ility for one another, all the time. And, it\u2122s not \u0152 it\u2122s this being together, and worrying about another, because once we got off the train in Auschwitz, when we were brought \u0152 we were told to step out of the cattle cars and we stood there on the ramp \u0152 it wasn\u2122t a bi g transport. It was a small group of people. And being a working unit, not a group, a transport from a ghetto that was liquidated, they most likely felt that they are going to utilize us as labor force in Auschwitz, as well. We were not destined immediately to go to the gas chamber. So, Father stepped out and his car was like the car, the last car, and ours was the first car, where the women were. So we were separated, and I still remember wa ving to Father, saying goodbye, and he was waving to us. It was such a strange encounter coming to Auschwitz. It was just so awful. 65 We were traveling for about two days. We had several stops because every time a military train had to go by and they needed th e tracks, they put us on the side track in small communities. We never knew where we were until finally, we came in. We pulled into a brightly lighted area, and it was like th e middle of the night or a little later, and there was always such a mist around Auschw itz because it was - you know, there was a lot of humidity. So, we couldn\u2122t see the fences or the electrically charged poles, but all we could see was the big, big light and the mist, a mist all around. The mist was kind of like in a dream. You didn\u2122t \u0152 you saw shapes, but yet you couldn\u2122t see them clearly, and not until daybreak did they take us out \u0152 I mean, they opened the doors and we left the cattle cars, and they took us to the barracks. No, before they took us to the barracks, of course, we had to go through the routine. So, we took our \u0152 all we had, like a little knapsack that they let us carry, because that\u2122s all we came with. It\u2122s not like we were coming from home like most of the transpor ts that they brought a lot of personal belongings. We came from a camp. We didn\u2122t have much. So, it was like a knapsack or something very small where we carried a few personal things, and they brought us to this huge room, I remember, and there were the girl s at one desk for registration, and then at the next desk the girls who were tattooing th e number, and then there was the next desk where they were shaving or cutting hair. So, first we went through this \u0152 I mean, we went through this routine. We had to say where we came from and our names, our age, and everything, and this is how the process started. From your name, you become a number. So, they tattooed this number on my arm, and we stood all three one behind the other, and it was A14176 for my older sister Hania, it was A14177 for me, and it was A14178 for Renia. Now, after the war, we found out that the A was a new series, because the numbers were so tremendous by then, that they couldn\u2122t manage anymore. So, they introduced the A and then they introduced the B, I think, for the men, when they introduced the A for the women. We always stoo d next to one another. So, therefore, now if we \u0152 just in case we forget which number is ours, we have on following the next one."

            "answer": "Yes. I remember. So, this was the next stag e. And I was very, very upset, and I just didn\u2122t know, and I started to cry. I started to cry and the girl who was tattooing the number held my skin tight, and she says, \ufb01I\u2122m going to give you such a pretty number,\ufb02 she says, \ufb01that you\u2122ll never regret that you had it.\ufb02 Because, if you remember, some people had their number right here on this side of the arm, and the numbers are so big that they start at the elbow and end at the wrist, because in those days, people who were tattooing weren\u2122t experienced enough. When we came, which was still towards the end, it was July 1944, the people who \u0152 the women who worked at certain jobs, they were very, very experienced. So, this was the next thing. From there, we went to the benches where they were cutting hair and shaving hair, depending on the individual. I mean, they stood with clippers and they also had scissors, and here I am crying, and the girl who puts me down on the bench and she pushes my hair back, and she says, \ufb01Don\u2122t cry. I\u2122m not going to shave your head. I\u2122ll just cut it short.\ufb02 So, my hair wasn\u2122t cu t short \u0152 I mean, my hair was cut short, kind of cropped because I had very long hair. My sister was so gorgeous. She 66 had such beautiful waving hair. She was just such a beautiful, beautiful wo man \u0152 girl, and they cut her hair short and Renia has always curly hair so whatever they did was okay. And as my older sister gets up from the bench, there was a door with a glass in it, and she walked by and she kind of put her hand on her hair and kind of pushed a wave in place, and there was a German guard right behind he r. He grabbed her by the collar and he put her down back on the bench and he said to the girl who was cutting hair, \ufb01Shave it off.\ufb02 So, there she is. She had her hair short, and because she dared to look at herself, to see like any human being when there is a change that\u2122s coming about you, that you want to see what it looks like, so for this, she had her hair cut \u0152 I mean, shaven. Now, from there, we had to leave everything behind."

So, we are pushed from this point into the ne xt room which is the shower room. Now, we don\u2122t know where we are going. We heard stor ies about gas chambers. We never knew what they looked like. Nobody could describe what a gas chamber was like inside. We only knew stories that people are being gassed and that they are shower heads to make believe that it\u2122s a shower room. So, from this point, we are driven into that room with shower heads in it. If I remember correctly, we have to undress right then, or maybe before, right after the registration when we r eached the next step. It\u2122s not quite vivid in my head, you know, and we had to be undressed."

            "answer": "At the time only the hair, hair was cut, not hing else, and then we were without clothes, which means that either we had to undressed right before entering or maybe before the hair being cut. It seems to me right before entering. And we entered that room where the shower heads, and all of a sudden, you know, while we were inside, the cold water came from above and it was really very, very cold and we all screamed because it was just piercing through your body, and the water didn\u2122t run too long, and we forced out of this area into the next area, and there we came to a large room and there were women sitting behind a huge table with all kinds of dresses piled up on top of the table, and you were not handed a garment to wear. Things were thrown at you. So, each of us received a dress, a print dress. They did not have uniforms at the time that we arrived. I don\u2122t think they were giving out uniforms anymore. There were so much clothes that was confiscated from the transport of the arriving people w ho were put to the gas chambers that they didn\u2122t see any need for uniforms anymore. So, they threw dresses at us. And those were inmates, those were girls who were working th ere in the sauna, in that shower room. We never \u0152 as I mentioned before, size \u0152 there was never a question of whether it was your size, the right size, the wrong size. So, no sooner did we get our clothes thrown at us, if somebody was tall and had a very short dress while another person was very short and had a long dress, and someone was very sk inny and had a big dress or vice versa, a 68 heavier women a very tightly fitting dress, that we were exchanging among one another, with each other, so that at least we made those things fit. They were smelly dresses because all they did is they took the discarded clothes and they put it in \u0152 they had such huge vats with disinfectant fluid in it. I don\u2122t think they ever washed the dresses. I think that all they did was they so aked them in that and then they dried them because I remember that the dress was kind of damp, wh ether it was damp because it wasn\u2122t dried enough or whether it was damp because the da mpness was always there and it was lying somewhere, you know, where it didn\u2122t dry ou t completely. I don\u2122t know, but we didn\u2122t get any undergarments whatsoever. The only th ing we have gotten was just a dress to wear and nothing else. They allowed us to w ear the shoes that we brought with us. Now, in most cases, we recognize each other. I couldn\u2122t find Hania. Not only that she didn\u2122t look the way I knew her to look and to be, she was wearing a crazy print dress and because she had no hair whatsoever and she wa s very tall and very slim. So, it was like a pin, a long stem with a head, a small head on top. It was heartbreaking to see that transformation that only was like within a half hour no more, from such a beautiful girl that she was, so attractive and so pretty, to see such a pathetic looking creature. I mean it was just horrible. It was just horrible, my heart was breaking, and we were handed [coughs] Excuse me. We were handed like white pieces of cloth with the number that was printed on our arms, and under that white clot h with the number was a triangle. In our case, it was a yellow because it was for the Jewish prisoners. So, my number A14177, and we had to sew it on, on the garment, and th e dresses also had a big, red, wide stripe on the back. From this point on, we were ta ken to the barracks, but all morning was basically from the unloading of the train and going through the process until we were brought to the barracks."

Ther e were people in there, and the fear of the unknown when you come into something that you are not familiar with and you don\u2122t know what to expect. So, basically if you are there with other people around you, you only see that far, and nothing beyond. I don\u2122t think that it was in anybody\u2122s mind to stand there and try to figure out, you know, the size of the room or whatever it is. We were afraid as we entered. We were frightened by the blast of cold water that came on us. It stopped just as fast as it came. So, basically it was a big shock to the mind and to the body simulatenously, you know, because first you don\u2122t know what to expect and then the big shock of that icy cold water coming at you. That was the way we were brought to the barracks, and more or less on our way fr om the sauna to the barracks, sized up the situation \u0152 what the camp looks like. I mentioned before that we arrived and it was dark and between the mist and the lights, you real ly couldn\u2122t figure out where you were. In daytime, it was a sunshiny day so we could see that there were different areas fenced in, which meant that there were different secti ons of the camp. We were also passing by an area where there were men. A lot of people during the day when the saw others moving along the roads, they used to come close to the fences to look whether they will spot 69 someone who is familiar or whatever, and we were brought to the barracks, where Fela Berlant (ph) was the schreiberen, and she, of course, counted the group, accepted the group, made sure that everything was in orde r, you know, and they brought us to the designated part of the barracks that our group was to occupy, and we were told so-and-so many women to a space, and that was it. Now, there was no official introduction of what, how and when because this was a very simple thing, you know. Towards the end of the day we heard the voice of the woman who wa s in charge of \u0152 the assistant to the barracks\u2122 \u00c4lteste, the girl in charge of the barracks, her assistant, to Z\u00e4hlappel, to get out of the barracks, outside for counting, and coun ting was twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, before we had to return back to the barracks. In the beginning, they kept us for a whole month in a quarantine, as if to say that we were bringing some kind of disease from the outside, to protect the people w ho were on the inside. It was ridiculous."

In the middle was a small stove with a pipe, and then to the sides, there were like four wings, and each wing had an aisle and there were bunk beds on both sides.

            "question": "And does that mean you had to stay in the barrack all the time?",
            "answer": "No, we were allowed to go outside, and we weren\u2122t working the first two weeks. We weren\u2122t working at all. We were sitting outside. There was nothing to look at, not a blade of grass growing in front. It\u2122s dust, when it was dried and it was mud that you were sinking in, because it was a clay ground, and we used to sit sometimes trying to take care of our clothes in order to get the lice out of it, because the dresses that we have gotten, inasmuch as they were disinfected, they we re full of body lice. Fortunately, we went through typhus already so we were immune already at least to one disease that we didn\u2122t need. After two weeks, they took us to a place to work and there were huge rocks, and they told us to take the rocks and transfer th em to the other side of the big field. So, we did, and the couples who were German inma tes, German women inmates, they were beating us. They were always in charge of the working units, and hollering and cursing in language, in a kind of a language that we never heard of, we were never exposed to, you know, the names that we were called \u0152 the wo rst possible names. But, this wasn\u2122t, you know, you accept when you find yourself in a situation like this \u0152 to survive, people were doing all kinds of things that, sometimes to protect their own lives maybe, by being 70 mean, mean, bad or whatever to others, by mi streating other people, that they felt that they are going to be pro tected, th at it will give them a certain security and that they will survive. So, I don\u2122t know the motives why certain people behaved like human beings while the others behaved like beasts, and the assistant to the Block \u00c4lteste was a very, very mean woman. She was beating everybody and she cursing and she was hollering and from the moment we entered the barracks, sh e told us, \ufb01You\u2122re never going to get out alive of here. Whoever gets out of here is through the chimneys.\ufb02 That was degrading, you know? And the chimneys were quite visible because there were five crematories in Auschwitz and you could see them, and you coul d smell the burning of the human bodies and the smoke, it was permeating the air, because in 1944, the transports were coming from all over and predominately from Hungary, and those people, most of the people, went straight to the gas chambers and to the crematorium. So, you have to kind of condition yourself to a new situation, and on one hand, you are shocked and on the other hand you are trying to kind of make peace with your self that, well, this is the next stage, and not to give up hope, that you survived the other situations, that you are going to survive this one, as well. Yet there was \u0152 inasmuch as there was a lot more hope maybe in a way, as you were really fooling yourself to a certain extent, here you had the answers right before you that there\u2122s hardly any hope. You were hoping against yourself. I remember one night, it was a clear night and they didn\u2122t allow us to get out of the barracks right after the Z\u00e4hlappel, the counting. Normally, we had a very brief time to go to the bathroom, to visit a littl e bit with each other outside before we entered, but that was time that they were bringing a lot of trans ports and burning the people, and they just didn\u2122t want for us to be outdoors and witness too many activiti es. So, I remember it was a very clear night and the smoke, the dark smoke , was coming all day long. I could see it. It was the time of the quarantine yet, and we weren\u2122t yet taken out of the camp to work somewhere else, and the smoke was always th ere, coming out of the chimneys, and then at night you could also see fire \u0152 not the smoke so much as during the day, but you could see fire. And, you know, I was looking out this little window and I thought to myself, such little tongues of fire were escaping towards the sky, and I thought myself, \ufb01It\u2122s like human souls trying to go to Heaven.\ufb02 Fortuna tely, I didn\u2122t have \u0152 I wasn\u2122t separated upon the arrival from my sisters, a nd I hoped that Father, who was in good health, if he was put to work, that he\u2122s okay. So, I didn\u2122t have this immediate fear that somebody very close that we loved was burned in the crematorium, and yet it was so horrible to think, so horrible to think of how many people who ne ver experienced life, who were either teenagers or even little children who came to this world never had a future, and it\u2122s just heartbreaking, now that I\u2122m an adult and I am a mother and a parent, and I see how many innocent lives have been lost because of Nazi madness. It\u2122s just terrible. It\u2122s just terrible. And, this was their way of breaking you down spiritually \u0152 I mean, physically due to the fact that they didn\u2122t feed you enough, but spiritually. And also, you know, you kind of lost that feeling of \u0152 how am I going to say it \u0152 of self-worth. I mean, there was no future whatsoever. I mean, you were like a pawn in somebody\u2122s hands who was to determine whether you are going to live or whether you are going to die, and you were a pawn without committing any crime. You were not there because you committed a crime or you because you had done something wrong, or because whatever reason, but because 71 you were a Jew and that was the Final Solution and Auschwitz and Birkenau was the place to bring the Jews for the Fin al Solution. When they finally started to take us out after the month of isolation, where they cal led it \u0152 I\u2122m getting upset \u0152 quarantine, and they took us to the front, outside of the camp to different places of work, we could see groups that were passing by as we were ma rching to work, and in some cases \u0152 among them there were women \u0152 we usually tried to communicate in passing to find out where the people were from, so that if they me ntioned a familiar name, you called somebody\u2122s name from that town that you knew, and if they were among them, they answered and this is how we found my aunt who was from Radom. They were coming from the opposite direction and they asked, \ufb01Where are you from?\ufb02 And we said, \ufb01Starachowice.\ufb02 And, she started to call our names, and she says, \ufb01Remember, I\u2122m here, too, and I\u2122m still alive.\ufb02 That was my aunt Rosha Laks from, she had the same name as I, from Radon. She survived the war, by the way. And so, there was always the unexpected, sometimes good and sometimes bad. When we were coming back from work, we had enough time to go to the bathroom. You know, the bathroom was also a barracks that, that you only were allowed a certain number of minutes at a certai n time, because it was just one facility for twenty barracks that were in that particular area, and if people had diarrhea and they needed to stay a little longer, the couple was always running back and forth. You know, it was like \u0152 it really wasn\u2122t a bathroom. It was a \u0152 what do they call it in the military, those places where there are holes in the ground? I don\u2122t know what to call it."

So, she was running back and forth, and if any one woman needed to use the bathroom a little longer. She was hitting, out right hitting, clobbering the people with the rubber hose or whatever she had in her hand. But again, there was an advantage in this advantage because when you went to the washroom or you went to the bathroom, there was always a queue because, you know, this was your time and five minutes later was a time for another barracks, and because there were so many new transports coming at that time, 1944 in July, that we could inquire of where the people are from and whether they know anybody that we were looking for. So, sometimes people used to find cousins or aunts like in our particular case. Not that we had seen my aunt anymore in Auschwitz. It was just the one time when our paths had cro ssed. So, that was the advantage, inasmuch as you were beaten. Food was delivered daily to the work place, and in the evening at Z\u00e4hlappel, we were getting our bread and the coffee in the morning. We did not have individual dishes, but they had these bowls that they filled and since we always marched five abreast, five, you know, that a bowl full of food was given to one person and we had to pass it around and everybody took a gulp and passed it to the next one, so there was an orderly distribution of whatever was given in that bowl, whether it was soup or the coffee in the morning, quote-unquote, you know.

But distribution of food, for exampl e, of bread was \u0152 they did Z\u00e4hlappel in the evening before we entered the barracks. And the piece of bread was mostly sawdust, and I would say a size of maybe two inches by an inch: an inch thick, an inch wide and two inches long. I wrote the story about a day in Auschwitz which I called \ufb01One Ordinary Day\ufb02, and it\u2122s a very \u0152 it was a very typical difficult day, and we went to work and we worked cutting down marshes along the river to clear the view of the watchtowers because it was October already of 1944, and there were underground activities, and people were escaping and some people we re successful, and some pe ople were not, and those who were not successful were brought back to camp and there was a public hanging or they were shot or whatever, but we were cutting the marshes and it was pouring all day and we stood in Z\u00e4hlappel and got wet and went to work and even got wetter, and we stood in the mud that was coming up to our knees and the capo was in a horrible mood and the German SS men who were es corting the group with the dogs were horrible, and after returning from work, we were told to sing, and we couldn\u2122t sing. I mean, we sang but not for marching, and they wanted us to march in good step w ith the clay and everything on our legs. So, they sicked the dogs on us, and the dogs tore the clothes off the people who were on the outside of the columns. It was ju st a horrible, horrible day, and then we came to our barracks and we lined up for Z\u00e4hlappel and it is still raining and my sister Hania is in front of the column of the five girls because it was always right in front of the barracks. It was a long line, always five abreast. So, if we were marching, we were facing this way, but when we were standing in front of the barracks, there was one in the front and four people in the back. And Hania was complaining that she\u2122s dizzy and that she\u2122s not feeling well and that she has a headache an d this and that. And we were counted, the food was brought, and Saranka (ph), the woma n who was so rough and rude, was the one who was distributing the food. So she was placing five portions of bread in the hands of the person that was in line up front and the person in the front was to pass the bread over to the people in the back, and Hania was up front that day, and as the bread was placed in her hands, instead of turning around and passing the bread to others, she took the bread \u0152 the five portions of bread \u0152 and she brought it to her mouth. She was hungry and she had all the bread in her hand, and when I saw it I was right behind her, I started to scream. I said, \ufb01Hania, don\u2122t do it. It\u2122s not yours. It belongs to all of us.\ufb02 And, it wasn\u2122t a matter of not wanting her to eat my bread, but we were only three. There were two girls that were no relation whatsoever to us, and I kind of scared her so that all of a sudden, I could see that her eyes have turned like this in her head. She looked at me, and I could see how her eyes turned around and she became pale and she fell to the ground. And when I looked at her lying there on the ground with her hairless head, and by then it was already almost three months in camp where we didn\u2122t look anymore like we looked three months earlier 73 when we came from the camp. So, between her lying there with a shaved head and her face as, you know \u0152 without much flesh, she look ed like \u0152 her face was like a skull, and I thought that she had died. So, I fell to my knees and I started to cry, and I tried to shake her, and I held her hand, and I said to her, \ufb01Please don\u2122t die.\ufb02 I said to her, \ufb01I\u2122ll give you my bread. I\u2122ll give it to you today. I\u2122ll give it to you every day.\ufb02 And she did not respond, and then the woman who was distributing th e bread saw a commotion at our end and she came running and she saw what happened. So, sh e started to holler for someone to bring a bucket of water, and she poured a bucket of water in Hania\u2122s face. So, when Hania opened her eyes \u0152 because she basically fainted from hunger and from exhaustion and everything \u0152 and she opened her eyes and I was holding onto her hands, and she had this smile on her face, not knowing at all what ha s happened to her. So, I picked her up, and I propped her up, so to say. I was holding on to her from one side and Renia from the other. And at Z\u00e4hlappel, you have got to stay in line, be in perfect alignment, and inasmuch as she was rude and ugly a nd unbelievable, that assistant to the Block \u00c4lteste, she didn\u2122t say anything. She didn\u2122t reprimand us. She didn\u2122t holler. She did nothing. We just stood for the rest of Z\u00e4hlappel, and then when we went to the barracks, we all went to bed and lied down in our wet dresses. There was no way how to dry them and where to hang them, but we were nine people in that sp ace, so we kind of cuddled together, hoping that the clothes on our bodies will be dry the next morning when we have to get up and go to work again. So, these were the different experiences. From Father we didn\u2122t hear at all, inasmuch as we were hoping that some how no matter what, we would be able to make contact with him. People told us that there was a way of contact men, because there were always male inmates that were coming as electricians, as plumbers, to the camp. So, that if we were to know where he is, because there were different villages around. There were different factories where they employed people. That if we know exactly which campsite that he is at, that maybe there w ould be a chance for us to find out. While we were in Birkenau in that barrack, we couldn\u2122t know anything about Father, and we ourselves were already reaching a point wher e even our feelings and emotions were dying in us. Forget about everything else. You know, you have compassion for people, you try to assist others, and so forth and so on, and then you reach a point that not only your body gives up physically, but even your emo tions and your feelings. That\u2122s why so many people tried to end their lives and ran to the electrically charged fences. Because if they were alone, they couldn\u2122t cope with this life anymore. That was enough for them. So, it was at a point now that there was almo st no hope, and it is Fela Berlant (ph), the schreiberen, who went with a report to the headquarters and found out that they need clerks, office clerks, and came running and told us to follow her without a word, without too much commotion that we were able to secu re a better position that brought us into a new life \u0152 a new life that we didn\u2122t even know that existed in Birkenau. So, we recovered physically, mentally, for a short duration. So, we had three months of horrible experience, and then we had about two and a half months \u0152 November, December, until January 14 th \u0152 that put us back on our feet and we were able to again withstand the difficulties of the death march that followed. And this, too, was a difficult thing inasmuch as we were in a much better situation than anybody else because we had good shoes and we had a warm coat and we had gloves and we had scarves and we had hats and we had clothes on us. It 74 was not like the situation when we first came, the first three months, that outside of one dress, we didn\u2122t have anything. And another thing that helped us to pull through that period of the death ma rch was that the Polish women with whom we worked had some supplies because they were always getting some food from home. So, th ey had a little bit of sugar that they divided between the people as we were leaving the camp, and it is the combination of snow \u0152 it was snowing, it was cold, it was terrible \u0152 but it was the snow that kept us going because no matter how tir ed you were, you rubbed your face with the cold snow, you were more alert, and by mixing the snow with a little bi t of sugar, it gave you a little bit of energy, which was also very good. But here we had a problem with Renia because she just could not walk. She was very sleepy and we knew that no sooner will she sit down at the edge of the road \u0152 there were so many people driven at the time from every field, from the men\u2122s area and th e women, so it was whoever sat down or bent over or ran into the field to relieve themselv es or whatever were shot to death \u0152 and Renia couldn\u2122t walk and she started \u0152 she was delirious \u0152 and she started hallucinating. So, Hania and I grabbed her under her arms and we dragged her. As bad as the snow was, because it was very cold, it was very conveni ent for walking because we didn\u2122t really have \u0152 we weren\u2122t forced march and sing lik e when we were going out to work in the fields. We were all kind of sliding on that snow, and Renia didn\u2122t have to walk. She was just sliding along. And they brought us to a huge barn. I remember that, and the barn was \u0152 I mean, it was supposed to be a shelter, but it wasn\u2122t really a shelter. It was as huge barn where the Nazi soldiers, the SS men, could keep us contained in one area, locked in, but the boards were missing and there was no roof, you know, and the wind was howling and blowing and it was snowing. But we were kind of together for the night, and then we marched for another two or three days. And dead bodies were strewn all over the road, all along the road. It was men and women, becau se so many thousands of people were driven out of Auschwitz. Only those who were not able to get out of bed remained, but everybody else was just driven out of Auschwitz until, I think, about 40 kilometers from Auschwitz. They put us on a train. It was a flatbed, and it was full of snow, and we traveled from that town, I don\u2122t remember the name of it, but I know it was about 40 kilometers from Auschwitz, and they took us to Ravensbr\u00fcck"

            "answer": "There was never a discussion about it. It was an instinctive ki nd of a reaction to situation. If I was \u0152 if I was \u0152 if I could be of more help to one particular situation, I did it. If Hania was in a situation where she could be of help to the others, it was the same thing. I don\u2122t 75 know what was on my sisters\u2122 minds. We didn\u2122 t have conversations. We had each other, the physical being. There was no conversation. I mean, on occasion, yes, when we could, when we were allowed and we were not beaten and we were not exhausted and when our mind was functioning in a way that you n eeded, but what you thought about basically were the immediate needs and how are you going to manage the next day, to pull through it, and in what way this is going to happen. I know that at one point I developed a boil in my leg, and they took me to the infirmary and I was in the infirmary for several days \u0152 I don\u2122t know whether it was a week or whatever \u0152 and it was a friend of my mother\u2122s who saw my name, who was working in that infirm ary, who was a nurse in that infirmary, and when she saw my name and asked whether I know Pola Laks, I told her, \ufb01I\u2122m her daughter.\ufb02 That she saw to it that I was returned back, when I was through, that I was returned back to the same barracks from which I came. Because normally they never send you back. They send you to the crematorium if you did not recover, and in most cases people did not recover, but due to the fact that she kind of found out that I\u2122m the daughter of someone she knew or was fond of, that she took care of me and she sent me back to the barracks. So, I was very fortunate to be reunited with my sisters. There was a situation where my little sister disappeared completely and we didn\u2122t see her for 24 hours, and I don\u2122t even know where she was. And, then all of a sudden she appeared, but\u2013 And whenever I ask her, she says, \ufb01I don\u2122t know. I just don\u2122t know what happened, where I was.\ufb02 So, there was this constant fe ar of \ufb01are we going to be together? Is something going to happen to us that we ar e going to be separated? What is going to happen?\ufb02 For one reason or a nother, whatever the situati on developed good or bad, we somehow managed to remain together. It wasn\u2122t that we were so smart or that we knew how to manage. It was really without know ing, without knowing, and still I\u2122m told today, I think it\u2122s providence. I think there is nothing else that one could really explain why things happened to us the way they did."

The deliverers were people who went to the kitchen and two people carried the cauldron of soup. So, she was nearby and she had a cup in her hand, and she dipped it, and she was beaten terribly."

            "answer": "The assistant was so brutal. It was different. The Block \u00c4lteste was also a Jewish girl from Slovakia, but she was a different type. She was very \u0152 maybe she had understanding, but we did not come into contact with her that much. In the administration of the barracks, there were those three women \u0152 the Block \u00c4lteste \u0152 they were all Jewish women who came in at the very early stage. So, it was 1942, 1943, you know. Fela was the schreiberen. She had a big mouth, and she hollered all day, but she didn\u2122t hit and she didn\u2122t beat and her toughness was expressed, you know, as I said barking, because this is like some dogs barks and they don\u2122t bite. So, basically she didn\u2122t do any harm to anybody outside of hollering and then was this other women who never held her arms steady, but like a windmill. Her arms were going and whoever was in the way got beat up. And she was the one who was insulting and was calling us horrible names, and calling us whores, and God knows what. So, when I think about it now, and I know that she came with the first transport of women to Auschwitz, and they were 500 or whatever the number was, and small number of them remained, you know, su rvived and at the point when we came, that she must have been very bitter and b ecause she lost everybody. She felt that this \u0152 that we have to go through the same kind of a suffering that her group did and she was inflicting the pain on us, which gave her the security of the job that she had. But there was a human aspect to her that I see now that I\u2122m older, that basically she didn\u2122t have to be so helpful when Hania fainted. She could\u2122ve just walked by without any reaction whatsoever, and yet she made sure that she revived her by throwing the bucket of water and allowing us to stand there, and not being sympathetic or having any kind words or anything. It was all in the same manner, in a rude, hollering manner. But I explain it, so to say as, the human side of her by sheer demonstrating her w illingness to assist."

You \u0152 the last time, you talked a bout how important it was for you, what it did in terms of changing your self-image, and feelings of self-esteem with the people you were working for. I also want to know whether you understood the place of that work kommando in the structure of Auschwitz, how Auschwitz was being organized, or did you simply know the structure of that particular kommando?",
            "answer": "I wasn\u2122t even familiar \u0152 I didn\u2122t even know that a kommando like this exists. About Kanada we heard, because of all the belongings of the Jewish transports were going to Kanada, where the good things were separated from the worn things and sent to Nazi Germany. But I never knew th ere was such a thing of Effektenkammer , where Christian Polish women were employed and they were in charge of the belongings of political prisoners that were brought. Everybody had a different assignment. There were groups. Like, there was, again, the administrative part of the operation; there was the group that was storing the clothes; there was the group that was\u2013 kept whatever other belongings were. My job was with another girl, a Christian girl \u0152 her name was Ioasha, Ioasha Haborra (ph) \u0152 and we were in charge of suitcases. So, I walked into the room, a large room that had lots and lots of shelves, and the shelves were full of different sizes suitcases. None of them were real large. So me were satchels, some were like knapsack kind of canvas bags, and some were a small suitcase and all of that. We were very welcome by the group, the 20 Jewish women, or 25 Jewish women who were sent to replace the other \u0152 other Polish women who were sent on transport, and they treated us very, very well. I think I mentioned before that they were mostly intelligent women, educated women and they were very kind to us. We found out later on that there were many among them who were Jews on assumed pa pers. So, I would say that we were like 50/50 or maybe even more Jews, but some of them were under false papers and considered themselves Christian, I mean, cons idered themselves as Poles rather than Polish Jews. The job we had to do was, when a person was released from Auschwitz, a Polish political prisoner, that we had to make sure that the belongings she brought, that her personal belongings that she brought \u0152 her clothes and so forth and so \u0152 were transferred with her, or if she was released from the camp, that everything went with her as well. During this period that we worked together, we had to gain the confidence of the Polish women that were there before becau se, as we were getting more and more acquainted, and as the underground activities were kind of increasing and there was more contact with the outside, that we had to be part and parcel of what was happening, and I\u2122ll give you an example. There were women who were working in very important departments, and it\u2122s only there that we found out what was happening. There were women who had access to the lists of daily tr ansports. There were women who worked in the laboratory were Dr. Mengele was doing experiments on the children, and they had every record what was being done to the children and so forth, and other very important operations performed by the Nazi on the campsite to which nobody was privy and it 78 never left the camp. And yet, through this Effe ktenkammer , every once in a while, a list came in, a piece of paper came in that I never witnessed openly where I would be able to read or see what was written, but let\u2122s say on two occasions Ioasha and I had to rip apart a suitcase and glue in a letter, an envelope, into the lining of the suitcase or place an envelope once in the bottom of a pocketbook. And it went with the person that was released from camp. Now, how did I know what we were doing? We were just told that this is a mission that we have to fulfill a nd that we should not ask any questions. How did they find out about it? I remember, there was a woman Krystyna Jevulska (ph), an inmate, and she was a Jewish woman from the Lodz. But she came to Auschwitz under an assumed name as a political \u0152 Krystyna Jevu lska (ph) \u0152 as a political prisoner, and she had contacts on the outside. The family that she maintained contact with was sending to her packages, food packages, monthly so nobody could suspect that she was Jewish, because if you have family outside and they send you food packages, then you definitely \u0152 Jews did not have anybody who was sending daily packages. And I remember one day \u0152 we ate together most of the time. We didn\u2122t have to stand on Z\u00e4hlappel, and sometimes we didn\u2122t eat the food for the camp, but they give us some provi sions that we could prepare a meal by ourselves. We were a sm all group. So, I remember one day, a package came for Krysia Jevulska (ph), and in the p ackage was a hard-boiled egg, and the joy and the happiness was indescribable. I mean we didn\u2122t know why was everybody so excited. Well, after a while when things had simmered do wn, we were told that in that letter \u0152 in one of the letters, I don\u2122t know which one, whether the one in the suitcase or the one in the pocketbook that was sent out, a message was sent to the family that was sending to packages to Krysia that if they receive this letter \u0152 because of course there was important information that had to be sent out in that co ncealed envelope \u0152 that if they receive this information that should include in the food p ackage that they are sending one hard-boiled egg, which will be an indication that they know what is going on and that they received it. So, in a way, it was so important to know that in all that horrible experience that each and every person that was incarcerated went through, that some news about what was going on in camp was reaching the outside world. I mean, I\u2122m only talking about the department of the suitcases. In what other ways things were smuggled out, I don\u2122t know. I\u2122m sure that they never used the same syst em, because they would be caught sooner or later. So, there must have been different departments. Departments must have been sending news out. That was, so to say, th e only possible way of contacting \u0152 for the inmates to contact the outside, the outside world."

            "answer": "No, the idea was that the person who was leav ing, they would never put something with a person who was not trustworthy.

They never \u0152 for her not to be afraid, I\u2122m sure they di dn\u2122t tell her where exactly it is, I mean, in 79 which place and how to do it, but they must ha ve told her that some where \u0152 I mean, it\u2122s not that I did, you know, it\u2122s how I knew about it \u0152 that she was aware of taking out of camp something that was very important fo r the people who were outside to know, and this is how we got the hard-boiled egg. That was only one time in my being in that Effektenkammer which was just unbelievable. But we had a wonderful three months that, as I said before, that we regained not only our physical strength but our self-esteem, and it gave us hope that somehow th ere is a chance that we\u2122ll be able to come out of this hell."

I think she was a Communist, a member of the Communist party. She was like \u0152 I would say she was the inverse of a university student right before the war, and university students had all kinds of organizations and Jews were not very welcome in too many organizations, university organizations. So, most of the young Jewish peop le were so infatuated with the ideology of Communism that I think she was one of the members. She speaks about it briefly in that interview, but not much.

They performed for the Nazis with concerts of Wagner and then they played marches for the groups leaving the camps. I don\u2122t really remember exactly. I remember the orchestra, I remember the marches, but that\u2122s all I remember about it. I remember when Mala committed, cu t her veins, when she was caught after she escaped and she was brought back, because they called everybody to witness her hanging. When we were in Effektenkammer, or no, when we were in Effektenkammer, there was another hanging of the courageous four women who were bringing in Rosa Robota, and Sapirstein, and Weisblum, the four girls who were working with the explosives and they were bringing each day to camp and giving it to and giving it to the Sonderkommando, so they could build a bomb and blow up the crematorium. But we did not really actually witness it. So, you know, there were so many different activities of courage and trying to make the world aware wh at is happening and what is taking place. Some of the news came out, because after al l, young Karski came to the United States, and I love that man. I mean it\u2122s unbelievable how courageous that man was to be able to be smuggled into a camp and out and be an eyewitness and bring the news to Britain and 81 bring the news to Roosevelt in the Un ited States without a note on him. He had to commit everything to memory because he couldn\u2122t do it any other way. And the courage of that man to do it and then to be so disappointed that it took so long before some action was taken on the part of the British and the Americ an government to somehow assist and help in this situation or find an answer to whatever or to send airplanes to bomb or whatever. It wouldn\u2122t have mattered if some of the inma tes would have been killed in the process, because we were all dying. One way or another we would have been dead. But they would have discovered in 1944 about the atrocities and how many millions of people were killed and they could have stopped, even if they had done it in 1944, you know, hundreds of thousands of people could have lived."

This was such a disarray that no documents followed us. S o, we had to register again, and as we approached the registration desk, right then and there, we decided we are going to change 82 our names to Christian names.

            "question": "Did other Jewish women do the same thing?",
            "answer": "I don\u2122t know. It just happened. Sometimes a ll those things \u0152 you don\u2122t plan anything. We didn\u2122t plan anything. We didn\u2122t have a strate gy to follow. Everything was on an impulse. You either took advantage of a situation, ma ybe, if you knew what was happening or just sheer coincidence, but here we knew that, after we were with the Polish women, the Polish kommando , we knew that Polish political prisone rs have a better chance to survive than the Jews, but it didn\u2122t matter when we came to Ravensbr\u00fcck. Ravensbr\u00fcck was designed for 20,000 women and there were 80,000 of us when we came in. The conditions were deplorable. There was no standing room. It was something awful, and after the death march, even though we had wa rmer clothes and ev erything, we wouldn\u2122t have lasted more than two weeks in Ravensbr\u00fcck, between the beating and no food whatsoever and the tortures that were inf licted on us by the camp inmates, by the capos, by the Aufseherinnen, the SS women in uniform \u0152 it was just unbelievable. So, I kind of block out completely Ravensbr\u00fcck from my mind because it was of short duration and the only thing that I remember of Ravensbr\u00fcc k was that we changed our names. That\u2122s the only thing. And the next thing I remember from Ravensbr\u00fcck is that the uniformed men walked into the barracks and asked for 50 volunteers. And because, as I said, there was standing room only and we were always \u0152 we never pushed like other people, so we were always the last ones to come in, alwa ys in the draft and near door and God knows where. So we were sitting on the floor and I turn to Hania and I say, \ufb01What do you think?\ufb02 And she says, \ufb01Let\u2122s go.\ufb02 And then we came to the conclusion, because he said he\u2122s coming the following morning for the volunteers, he took everybody\u2122s name and that\u2122s it, and then I said to Hania, \ufb01Well, do you think we did the right thing?\ufb02 And we came to the conclusion that if we remain in Ravensbr\u00fcck, we are for sure dying within two or three weeks. If this 50 volunteers are going to be taken to die or to be killed, then it will happen immediately, but there is also a chance that they need 50 volunteers to go to work somewhere else. And he came in the morning and picked up the 50 volunteers, they put us on the truck, and they were all women from all over. There was a woman from Hungary, and a woman from Yugoslavia, and from Czechoslovakia, and we were Polish from Poland, and they were German women, I mean Jewish German women, and we all were on the truck and we were traveling for a half hour, for an hour, and we were still on the truck. Nobody stopped the truck. So, after two hours, we came to the conclusion, we looked at each other and we came to the conclusion that they didn\u2122t have to drag us for that long to kill us, that we are going somewhere where they want to make use of us one way or another. So, they brought us to Retzow. Retzow was a military camp. It was a Luftwaffe, the air force, that was brought back because it was in 83 Mecklenberg, which was the northern part of Germany close to the Baltic Sea between L\u00fcbeck and Hamburg, and they needed people to work in the airfield to dig ditches \u0152 not ditches, but trenches and so forth, and do the work and cleaning. So, the first transport that arrived was basically for administrative jobs or for clean ing offices. So, they were the ones like the girls from Slovakia who were experienced administrators, so they got the good jobs, and we took whatever it was. Hania was cleaning offices and Renia was like a valet to a German SS woman, and I was also cleaning offices, and Hania tells this very nice story from Retzow that she was cleaning offices. Among the space that she had to clean was the office of one of the officers, and he always left papers, and he had the radio there and everything. And Hania, realizing the situati on, that papers are always there, pretended that she doesn\u2122t speak any German. So, he\u2122s talking to her and he\u2122s telling her what to do. So, she says, \ufb01Nicht verstein\ufb02 (ph) and \u0152 Hania tells this story and I always laugh about it \u0152 \ufb01Nicht verstein\ufb02 (ph), which means in kind of a broken way, \ufb01I don\u2122t understand anything.\ufb02 Because no sooner di d he go out, she went to look at what was on the desk or she listened to the radio. So, one day he was still suspicious. He wanted to know what\u2122s going on. So, he come s in and she\u2122s there on the floor scrubbing the floor with a brush, and mopping up the floor, and he says to her, you know, he wanted to catch her, \ufb01Did you hear what they announced on the radio?\ufb02 And she says, \ufb01Nicht verstein.\ufb02 So, he looks at her with contem pt and she says, \ufb01So gross ker faxen and so dom\ufb02 (ph) which means, \ufb01So gross ker faxen\ufb02 (ph) \u0152 so tall, because \u0152 and so stupid. So, this is Hania\u2122s favorite story from it, but sh e heard every bit of news every day. When she came in the morning, that was the first room she had to clean. So, she heard the news and then she went to work. And Renia, because she was kind of a valet to the SS woman who was in charge of the entire group of supervising women in camp, so she liked Renia a lot, and she says, \ufb01How can I help you? W ould you like to have some food? Are you hungry?\ufb02 And this, and, Renia says to her, \ufb01Not really. I don\u2122t want you to give me anything, but my middle sister is a very good cook, and if you just could see to it that my middle sister gets a job in the kitchen, then it will be just wonderful.\ufb02 So, she went to the chef and she told him that she has a girl that she would like to work in the kitchen, that she\u2122s a very good cook and that she knows how to prepare good food, and for the food especially that \u0152 not for the camp food, but fo r the SS people. So, they gave me a job in the kitchen, and the kitchen was whatever had to be done. Either I was in charge of the big kettle where we cooked for camp, or I wa s preparing hamburgers for the German men in uniform that were in the Air Force, or we used to cook that farina every morning for breakfast for the military. So, that was good because you couldn\u2122t be hungry anymore, and we were cutting up the bread that was rationed for the eventual groups of people that came after us. We were the first ones. We were there for a few days, and they brought about a few thousand women to do the outside work. I remember once there were girls sweeping the floor outside and I was standing and frying hamburgers for lunch or for dinner for the Germans, and I saw the girls outsi de the fence. It wasn\u2122t very far and the window was big and wide open, and I was flipping the hamburgers and I was every once in a while flipping one outside, and so help me, I still remember, there is a woman who lives in Miami and she\u2122s Hania, also Hania, and she always says, \ufb01I grabbed one of those hamburgers you threw out the window.\ufb02 So, you know, you didn\u2122t have to \u0152 you just had 84 to be there to take advantage of every little situation, and you know, it didn\u2122t do \u0152 I mean, I haven\u2122t done any heroic deeds. I saw people are there. I figured whoever grabs it will grab it."

            "question": "Were you able to somehow get food so you could bring it to your two sisters?",
            "answer": "Always, that was my job. That was really my job because in the beginning, I was in charge of the kettle, the big kettle. So, what we did is we were lighting the fire \u0152 there was like a huge, huge metal container, and under it was where the fire was burning, and we had to all night we had to feed \u0152 I mea n, the wood, place the wood so that the kettle would be cooking. So, this meat, to prepare a meat base for a soup, you had to cook it for hours and hours because I don\u2122t think it was beef , I think it was horse meat at the time. And that was prepared for the soldiers. So, there were several of us who remained in the kitchen all night, not all the time because there were shifts, you know, sometimes one group of women and sometimes another group of women. The week that I was working at night with the other women, then at four o\u2122clock in the morning, we were separated from the camps because, due to the fact that we were cooking for the soldiers and cleaning for the soldiers, they didn\u2122t want us to live in the campsite. But under the kitchen in the basement, they set up cots for us to sleep in and wash and keep ourselves clean. So, in the morning, like at four o\u2122clock in the morning, before the chef came in, we used to have aprons \u0152 big, heavy canvas aprons \u0152 so one of the girls was standing there with a hook fishing out the tongs and the other small parts of the meat that we were able to get out, and put it in the apron, in one of the aprons, and two of us were on the look-out each way, and one was running with that hot stuff in that canvas apron. We used to come in \u0152 We were all in one room, the 50 of us , all in one room. So, we dumped it like on 85 whatever it was, I don\u2122t rememb er, whether on the bed or on the table and we started to rip it apart and eat it."

        {
            "num": 154,
            "question": "So, all 50 of you, as many as could share would share?",
            "answer": "Yes. There was always enough. Then, I mean, when I wasn\u2122t in the kitchen at night, I reme mber how we worked \u0152 but there were ot her girls that were on that shift, you know, then they did it. So, this is the way we su rvived in Retzow. And then, of course, we started to see the airplanes flying, and I reme mber when they threw leaflets, and they were announced that Roosevelt passed aw ay and Harry Truman became President, because we came to Retzow in February. We came at the end of January to Ravensbr\u00fcck, and two weeks later, like end of February, and this must have been March or April. I don\u2122t remember when Roosevelt passed away. This I remember, and they were always sounding the sirens because of the fear of the attacks from the air, and so, I was watching the women. We were all so happy when we saw those silver planes. It was such a delightful thing, and especially when it was on a weekend, on a Sunday, when we didn\u2122t work, because there was no personnel there. A nd the way people reacted to situations, you know? Hania used to get a hold of any f ood that was available and she was eating and eating and eating and eating like there was no tomorrow. There wasn\u2122t a problem anymore with food, as I mentioned to you, because I was working near food and we were not that starved. There was another girl \u0152 this was also a very unusual kind of a thing \u0152 but she used to fill a bucket with water, undressed completely, and she stood there and she was washing her body. For the duration of that period, from the time when the alarms sounded until the alarm sounded again that it\u2122s over, she stood there and she was washing from head to toe, just pouring water on her as if to cleanse herself from God knows what. And you watch people behave in situations th at are so strange, and you can\u2122t figure out why people would do such things, a nervous reaction of one kind or another. Hania\u2122s eating was not because she was hungry. It was a nervous reaction, and of course, before long, we find out that the war was over. It was the beginning of May \u0152 fourth or fifth of May \u0152 when we could see that the whole thing is getting out of control, even the people who were in charge of the camp were not paying much attention, and everybody was trying to kind of escape. We were getting packages by then the Count Bernadotte has arranged through the Red Cross to send packages to inmates in different campsites like Bergen-Belsen and whatever was close by. So, they were care packages that came, and in the care packages was chocolate and cigarettes. So, the Nazis took out the cigarettes and chocolate and distributed the rest of the food \u0152 crackers, sardines, whatever was there, which was okay, maybe it was better, because otherwise we would have gotten sick, God knows what, and then Renia, Hania knowing what was going on and Renia sensing from that woman for whom she worked that someth ing is going to happen soon, all of a sudden is very patronized by that woman. The war may end soon, and after all, it hasn\u2122t been so bad in camp, and if a question comes up that \u0152 how the Germans behaved, I hope you are going to give a kind word - this kind of a thing, these kinds of conversations. By then, they were trying to kind of save their own skin. Then, they came in the morning and they said the came is being evacuated. Now, where evacuated, nobody knew. Now, I find out 86 that this constant moving from one camp to th e other was for the Nazis to save their own skin, because if they wouldn\u2122t ha ve had the prisoners to move them around, they would have been compelled to go to the front, and they wanted to save their lives. So, as long as they were in charge of the prisoners, they had a very legitima te excuse why they have to remain. But by then, when we saw they were losing control of anything that is happening, and we were taken out from the camp and we ca me to that main road that led to this community, there was so much going on. Pe ople from everywhere going in every direction with little wagons loaded with household belongings and God knows, and you could see uniforms, German uniforms, thrown along the road. People were trying to get into civilian clothes to escape, not to be caught in uniform. So, it was just a horrible thing and we were driven and driven and driven and then, and the Aufseherin for whom Renia worked, she had that knapsack full of cigarettes, and she had her big cape and she had other things that she carried, and we all had a little bag with whatever. We had some sardines and some crackers, as I said before. And she says to Renia that it\u2122s hot and she would like for her to carry the cape for her. So, Renia took the cape from her and threw it over her arm and we were just marching. And in the group that left Retzow was Helen \u0152 Helena, and I don\u2122t know from where she was or we didn\u2122t know her for too long of a time, but she was a tall, blonde woman name d Helena, and she too had a big mouth, and she spoke German very well. So, she saw Re nia holding on to that cape. So, she made sure that we lagged behind a bit, and before we had a chance to look around, she had the cape over her camp clothes and she was holleri ng \ufb01Get out, and get out of my way and get out of my way.\ufb02 And, she was pushing and pushing and pushing, pushing us towards the woods, the small group of women. There wa s like a little forest, and because there were civilians and there were the camp pris oners and there were the Germans who were trying, some in uniform and some already in civilian clothes, there was such a commotion, there was so much coming and going, you couldn\u2122t figure out what was happening. But we wound up in the middle of th e forest by night. So, we made a fire, a very small fire so that it wasn \u2122t visible. We were very deep in the forest by then, and we \u0152 I don\u2122t remember \u0152 to keep ourselves wa rm. How we opened the sardines I don\u2122t remember, but we had some of the sardines and in the morning, we got up and we walked. By then, it was quiet already. We kind of wound up on the other side of the forest instead of near the road. And there was a huge, huge estate with a magnificent home on top, and people were working in the fi eld. And we came out of the forest and we saw the people, so we figured well, if there are workers in the field, maybe they will help us in whatever way. Usually the fieldworkers were also either prisoners from a camp, but from the distance, we didn\u2122t know who they really were. And they noticed us and they saw us with the tags with the numbers a nd everything. So, they came running and they asked where we are from, and there was a guy who was from Kielce, and Kielce was the city to where Starachowice belonged; it was part of the district. And of course he says, \ufb01Nosha polachki!\ufb02 (ph) \ufb01Our Polish girls,\ufb02 you know? So, when we heard that, we didn\u2122t even admit that we are not Polish, that we ar e Jewish, Jewish Poles, I mean, Polish Jews, and due to the fact that we already had our names changed, so we could pretend that. So, I was Krysia and Hania and Renia, and there must have been maybe twenty men and women working in the field, and this man from Kielce he was in charge of the working 87 group, and he says, \ufb01Oh, did you come from camp ? Poor girls, poor gi rls. You must have suffered so much. Come with me to the hous e.\ufb02 And we went up to the house, and the house \u0152 the only person who was left in the house was the German woman who was in charge of the operation, because the graph ( ph) or whatever was down there \u0152 I mean, it was a mansion. It was such a huge estate that it didn\u2122t belong just to a wealthy man. It belonged to a very, very impor tant, I would say, kind of individual. So, he comes in and brings us and we are dirty and tired and I don\u2122t have to tell you what it\u2122s like being on the road for so long. And he says to her, \ufb01These are my girls, and you make sure that they are \u0152 that they get clean and washed and prepare fo r them the best meal there is.\ufb02 An outright order from a person that was only a fiel d worker, but because nobody was around and he saw most likely what was happening, so that woman was very, very frightened. We were three and there was a Russian girl and there was Helen and I think there were two more girls, I don\u2122t remember exactly how many of us were in there. Now, I had a piece of soap to \u0152 and got into a bathtub with such fancy fittings and all that and a terrycloth towel to wipe myself, and then we were brought into the dining room, after we were all cleaned up and we walked around a little in the field. And the people who were working in the field were not allowed to come into the house. It was off limits to them, but this man somehow felt that now he\u2122s in charge because he was the head of the working crew and the owners were not around and the whole place was empt y with the exception of this one woman. So then we come into the dining room and \u0152 this is funny, but you know how things change from one to the next \u0152 so, here\u2122s that huge dining room with a banquet table with the upholstered furniture and the heavy drapes, beautiful white drapes hanging from the huge, huge windows. It\u2122s a beautiful estate, and that woman is so frightened and she\u2122s bringing bread sliced up and then she\u2122s bringing butter in, and the butter is laid out in little patties with the family crest. [Bursts out laughing.] I\u2122m laughing because it\u2122s ridiculous. It seems like it\u2122s in the movies. With the crest of the family on the butter\u2013 And then she brings the food. I don\u2122t remember what we ate but what strikes me very funny is here I am again in the dining room with her with a damask cloths on the table with the fancy china and with the napkins and even the family cres t on the butter, which we did not have at home but the table was al ways set for eating in a proper manner. So, here, in addition to what I remembered fr om home from a way back, was that butter which was cut in small pieces with the family crest on it. In my home we had a beautiful butter dish with a cover. It was because the butter came in a block. So, it was a personal dish with the block of butter in it. It was either a block or an oval, depending on where you bought it. If you bought it in the market fresh from the peasant, it was always like an egg, a large egg-shaped thing they kept in leaves for it to stay cold, you know, when they brought it from the village and it had a cover ov er it. So, that was kind of a remembrance of what it was last being at home and findi ng ourselves in this environment all over again. And we were there for about four or five days, because we were liberated by the Russians, I mean, this area was liberated by the Russians. And the Russian officers came to check on the inventory, to take over as far as livestock is concerned and everything else, and they found us and inasmuch as th e officers. So, jabusky (ph) \u0152 immediately, they wanted to make sure that we come to work for them. So, the man who was in charge of the working group came and said, \ufb01We are going to home and you are coming with us. 88 We are all going to make our way back to Po land.\ufb02 So, that was May \u0152 first week in May of 1945."

She married a man during the war, and they both died \u0152 they were both taken to camps and killed. Next to her, leaning on my father\u2122s shoulder, is Aunt Regi na. She was a beautiful woman. She was a wonderful, wonderful, full of verve and just an exciting person. She was just beautiful. She too was married during the war, and she and her husband perished also. There is my father who, when we we re brought to Auschwitz, he was separated from us. He lived until the end of October, and the day he was taken \u0152 after his selection \u0152 to the gas chamber, we finally located him. Unfortunately, it was too late. Inasmuch as we sent him the letter to him to let him know that we are alive. I guess that if he knew that we were still around, maybe he would have had the strength to live through the war as well. That was October 1944 when we were already in Effektenkommer and we had the ability to make contact with him. Then fu rther down is my Aunt Rosha. She was the youngest of my mother\u2122s sisters. Regina wa s also my mother\u2122s sister. Rosha was my mother\u2122s sister. She attended the university. She was a student of \u0152 she was a pharmacist when she graduated from college, and she too perished. Next to her is Dora who \u0152 the dark lady \u0152 who was my father\u2122s sister.

Now, below here is my Aunt Angia, who again is my mother\u2122s sist er, and she was a single woman and she also perished in the war. Then comes my Gra ndma Sarah, who was widowed in the \u201a30s, and this is the mother of my mother, and sh e was a very intelligent woman, and a very educated woman, and when she married my grandpa, Leibush (ph) Tannenblum, she became very, very religious, and anything about religion that I know is because, in katshrut (ph), in observances, is because she always wanted to know how much I know about being Jewish and leading a Jewish life and she was always teaching me whenever I was coming for a visit. And next to her is my sister Hania, who is sitting in my mother\u2122s lap, and Hania must have been a year, a li ttle older maybe, my mo ther holding onto her. And, that\u2122s the family. So, as you see from the whole group, there is Dora on the extreme right in the standing row behind and Hania who is the baby. Everybody else perished."

I mean, inasmuch as it was very comfortable on the outside, but it needed a lot of work \u0152 comfortable on the inside, it needed a lot of work on the outside. So, here\u2122s my father and my ol der sister Hania and my mother and then Renia and I. I think that picture was taken later than the three sisters, because we all seem to be much older here in it. \u212236? I don\u2122t know, but anyhow it was still in the old house and I don\u2122t remember exactly when we move d. I know that we moved right before the war.

At the time it was no museum, just a council, and the members of the council were from different walks of life, different groups, different religions. So, Miles came up with the idea that in order for them to know what the council is all about, it would be worthwhile going to Poland, and Eli Weisel was the chairman at the time, and Miles took the chairmanship of organizing that trip. So, we were in Poland visiting the places of annihilation and, due to the fact that one of the Paliszewski sisters was still alive and this is Maria Paliszewska, we took her with us. We went to visit her and we brought her with us to Warsaw. I just wanted to present he r to the group, for her to meet the Americans who came to visit Poland to learn about the te rrible story of the Holocaust and to present her to the group in her kindness and her generosity and her understanding that she showed her family. So, she went along with us everywhere we went, include Treblinka. She insisted that she comes to Treblinka, because she, too, felt that she wants to visit the place where Mother lost her life. Her mother was killed. So, her we are with Miles on the left and then Mrs. Paliszewska is in the middl e, and I\u2122m on the right, and the name of the 92 community is right on the big rock, it\u2122s like chiseled in the rock. It says \ufb01Starachowice.\ufb02 And around you can see small rocks and bigger rocks and smaller rocks and each represents a community, a destroyed community."
