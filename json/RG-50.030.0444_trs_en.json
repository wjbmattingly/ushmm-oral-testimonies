            "answer": "Yes. You know that I know that my -- for instance, Lynnie. They will bring up the children with the knowledge of horror, what happened. And therefore Lynnie wanted, I started to write -- which I don\u2122t write -- write -- she asked me to wr ite about Holocaust. And then she was so happy when she heard that you will interview me, because she wanted her children to know what was going on when we left Austria. And she wanted the children know about it. And I had a wonderful experience with friends here sht -- all my friends were pupils, of course. And [indecipherable] invited in their house and the husband asked me about leaving Austria, about why, and so on. So I told him I\u2122m Jewish and so on. And then children came for dinner and he said, I want that Erna repeats now, so that you know, what s -- what she went through. And I admired that. I was very happy, because these ar e people [indecipherable] of course not -- not Jewish. And I admire that the father told the young children, you should know what was going on, why Erna is here, you know? But I have really to say I always felt, because we are two. I never felt I did it for myself. I felt always I just make it as easy as possible for my husband. And I\u2122m sure he felt the same for me. People who went -- came alone, I tried to help a lot, because I felt so bad for them. I had a girlfriend, for inst ance, from Vienna, and we knew her very well, and she was here in Boston, and she wa -- and every weekend, whatever we did we tried to -- to take her, because she was alone. And that -- that is hard, to come alone. And her mother died in Vienna, but not in the concentration camp, she was sick. So it\u2122s -- that is -- makes it really hard. I feel this was a really -- lucky that I had the pa rtner for whom to -- to be. And I never regretted that I work hard, or so, I -- I didn\u2122t know it. I didn\u2122t know it, the others knew it, but I didn\u2122t know that I work hard. I\u2122d -- we were -- and I\u2122m ve ry lucky now, because my husband [indecipherable] so little, and I also [indecipherable] to Rubenstein. We both earned 30 dollars a week, that I remember like anything. Then his mother ca me, and we didn\u2122t know whether we have enough 81 money for it -- to -- for eating. And -- and my hu sband always said, because we couldn\u2122t put money aside, he said, what will we do v -- when we both retire? And I said, we will be in a rocking chair and remember the good old times. But I thought -- I collected many things about exercises, I thought I will write in paper, in newspapers about exercises if I can\u2122t teach any more. And I\u2122m a very bad writer, but I thought I would. My husband would have helped me. So is -- it is really when I think back to the \u212238, it was, of course horrid, horrid to leave your -- where you were born and where you lived, and all your friends there, and to leave the parents, that was the worst. And then, when we left with the airplane, I think it was the first time I was in an airplane, and the cook came -- or maid came to the ai rport and waved good-bye, you know, it was that -- an awful experience, of course. But I never thought again and again, of it. Because I really -- we both wanted to assimilate here, even if my language is not assimilating, but we both wanted really to make the best with our life, and not make it harder, and we had no money to get -- go back to Europe. \u212263 i -- i-is the first time I went back, after 25 years."

And during the war, or af -- right after the war -- \u212247 it was in fact, one of my pupil one day ask me, do you care to use our farmhouse in New Hampshire? I said I will ask my husband. My husband at that time had no job, and wanted that I go alone on vacation because I needed it, and he wanted to stay in Boston, which I never would have done, to leave him in Boston alone. And of course he was delighted. We met. Before, she didn\u2122t know my husband, I didn't know her husband. All I knew her during th e time, during the war, she has taken me -- sometimes in the evening she invited me for di nner. And my husband worked for -- sometime in the evening at the -- to make t eeth [indecipherable] teeth, false teeth. So I knew her only from that. This farmhouse was in New Hampshire, surrounded by 2,000 acres woods. It was a dream. Then she told me, but it has no electricity. And water it has only when the windmill goes, to get the water down. It was so lovely, it\u2122s -- the first time, of course, we were together. And then we were also some weekends, I thi nk, together. And they saw that my husband repaired everything, whether it was on the roof, or whatever was to be repaired, he was very handy. And I, of course, cleaned the house. So we got the key. Until six - \u212269, we -- my whole family went there. We always spent all of the holidays there together, the whole family. They came from New York, the Streichers with the -- then with the children, afterwards with the gr andchildren. We had the house all the time, very seldom they went because they had a yacht, where they were in summer. In winter we couldn\u2122t, in the -- when it was snow. And when mud was, we had the Jeeps they 84 had there. So we left our car up, and -- but the first year, \u212247, when she asked me whether we want to use it, a f -- a farm, we had no car. They [indecipherable] another to -- pupil to ask me, would you care to use my car? I go on the cruise. So we had a car of another pupil. I thought that the [indecipherable] were terrific to us, really terrific. To let the house have us. All the time we were there. They moved then to Maine, so got -- first they lived on Brattle Street.
