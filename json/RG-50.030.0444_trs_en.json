And then I went back because I married a friend of mine whom I knew only 11 years. So we decided to marry. And I loved to be in Paris, of course, it was a wonderful experience as a young Viennese. People liked the Viennese people. They hated -- the French people hated the Germans, but they liked the Viennese, so I was lucky, and had a wonderful time. I was working there, because one could only take little money there. I could live only three months of the money which I\u2019ve taken with me. So I started es -- I wanted to stay longer than three months, and I started as soon as possible to earn money to stay longer.

We had a big apartment, and as we were four, we had many friends, and we [indecipherable] parents loved also to entertain, so we had to always saw the friends at home. My -- first, of course, I was not as much in the mountains, but when I grow up as a -- and had friends. If we -- if I say boyfriend, it does not mean like here that you sleep with them.

We were very lucky this way, we had always, as I say, Gentile friends, and in fact, our Jewish friends had very nice Gentile friends whom they married after Hitler to -- to go out with them.

And we were very proud, of course that our brother was of the stage. We were very young. So Salzburg was important. Afterwards we went to Italy with Mother, and we went to -- where else? We -- fit -- Italy several times, and always to a beach to swim.

So, of course, Mother was in despair only to get home. All she wanted, to get home."

When I read your letter, I had a -- v-very much to cry, because it was also still addressed to my beloved mother, but I will tell you in short\u201d -- as you say, in short -- \u201cin short sentence, my life what I had to go through. Mother and I were in July 1942 deported to Theresienstadt.\u201d They lived in Prague in Czechoslovakia. \u201cWhen we -- when we arrived there with the transport, all our -- our suitcase were taken away. Only 50 kilogram we had, with the most important things, but we never saw it again. I worked as a nurse, and I worked very hard so that I didn\u2019t -- so that we\u2019\u2019-- because her mother lived there -- \u201cthat we didn\u2019t have to come in another the -- to Poland, in -- in -- to tra -- to be transported to Poland. So Mother and I were all right. Then I got an awful\u201d -- you don\u2019t say angine in English, sore throat, but it is with an abscess -- \u201cand with 40 grade fever,\u201d that means 104 or five. \u201cAnd Mother ha -- Mother got an ear inf-infection, and her ears was very painful, and the doctor calmed me, said it can be only -- be taken care in the hospital and Tuesday early -- it\u2019s one of the specialist doctors, they said that see that she has an infectious -- infecting\u201d [indecipherable], it\u2019s in the -- God, this is hard for me to know. \u201cThe brain infection. Some brain infection. And there 1s a little hope if one operates. One has to open the head, and during the operation one saw that the head was f -- full of pus, and there was no hope for her. Tuesday evening, at 10:30, November 17, 1942, sh -- is my much beloved, good mother passed away. It is one -- it is very good, they said she was not conscious and f -- the good God has at le -- didn\u2019t let her suffer long. My darling mother cames - is [indecipherable] in the crematorium, burned, and I hope that I will get the urn\u201d -- do you say urn? -- \u201cwh-when -- when I come home, so -- so I can bury her with my brother, Bela. I am -- afterwards is I have four -- a 40 fever,\u201d -- that means 104 or something -- \u201cduring the sickness of my never to forget mother, the -- I was wa -- during the sickness all day and night I\u2019ve taken care of her, I\u2019ve nursed her. So -- I got so awfully sick mentally about the horrid loss, that I had to lie down for three months and I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t get better and I didn\u2019t want to get better. Everyone told me that it would be an misery, and one ca -- one can\u2019t change this misery, and it was surely not Mother\u2019s intention mis -- that I wa -- I-I was so bad off, and I tried to get better.

It\u2019s [indecipherable] she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got better and I worked very intensely. Then again the transports.\u201d -- do you see transport? \u201cIt started in September to [indecipherable]. I got in such a transport, but in the last moment, one had taken me out.

            "answer": "Yes. You know that I know that my -- for instance, Lynnie. They will bring up the children with the knowledge of horror, what happened. And therefore Lynnie wanted, I started to write -- which I don\u2019t write -- write -- she asked me to write about Holocaust. And then she was so happy when she heard that you will interview me, because she wanted her children to know what was going on when we left Austria. And she wanted the children know about it. And I had a wonderful experience with friends here sht -- all my friends were pupils, of course. And [indecipherable] invited in their house and the husband asked me about leaving Austria, about why, and so on. So I told him I\u2019m Jewish and so on. And then children came for dinner and he said, I want that Erna repeats now, so that you know, what s -- what she went through. And I admired that. I was very happy, because these are people [indecipherable] of course not -- not Jewish. And I admire that the father told the young children, you should know what was going on, why Erna is here, you know? But I have really to say I always felt, because we are two. I never felt I did it for myself. I felt always I just make it as easy as possible for my husband. And I\u2019m sure he felt the same for me. People who went -- came alone, I tried to help a lot, because I felt so bad for them. I had a girlfriend, for instance, from Vienna, and we knew her very well, and she was here in Boston, and she wa -- and every weekend, whatever we did we tried to -- to take her, because she was alone. And that -- that is hard, to come alone. And her mother died in Vienna, but not in the concentration camp, she was sick. So it\u2019s -- that is -- makes it really hard. I feel this was a really -- lucky that I had the partner for whom to -- to be. And I never regretted that I work hard, or so, I -- I didn\u2019t know it. I didn\u2019t know it, the others knew it, but I didn\u2019t know that I work hard. I\u2019d -- we were -- and I\u2019m very lucky now, because my husband [indecipherable] so little, and I also [indecipherable] to Rubenstein. We both earned 30 dollars a week, that I remember like anything. Then his mother came, and we didn\u2019t know whether we have enough money for it -- to -- for eating. And -- and my husband always said, because we couldn\u2019t put money aside, he said, what will we do v -- when we both retire? And I said, we will be in a rocking chair and remember the good old times. But I thought -- I collected many things about exercises, I thought I will write in paper, in newspapers about exercises if I can\u2019t teach any more. And I\u2019m a very bad writer, but I thought I would. My husband would have helped me. So 1s -- it is really when I think back to the \u201938, it was, of course horrid, horrid to leave your -- where you were born and where you lived, and all your friends there, and to leave the parents, that was the worst. And then, when we left with the airplane, I think it was the first time I was in an airplane, and the cook came -- or maid came to the airport and waved good-bye, you know, it was that -- an awful experience, of course. But I never thought again and again, of it. Because I really -- we both wanted to assimilate here, even if my language is not assimilating, but we both wanted really to make the best with our life, and not make it harder, and we had no money to get -- go back to Europe. \u201963 1 -- 1-1s the first time I went back, after 25 years."

And I feel always a f -- I started underground, and it was hard to get really on the ground. And during the war, or af -- right after the war -- \u201947 it was in fact, one of my pupil one day ask me, do you care to use our farmhouse in New Hampshire? I said I will ask my husband. My husband at that time had no job, and wanted that I go alone on vacation because I needed it, and he wanted to stay in Boston, which I never would have done, to leave him in Boston alone. And of course he was delighted. We met. Before, she didn\u2019t know my husband, I didn't know her husband. All I knew her during the time, during the war, she has taken me -- sometimes in the evening she invited me for dinner. And my husband worked for -- sometime in the evening at the -- to make teeth [indecipherable] teeth, false teeth. So I knew her only from that. This farmhouse was in New Hampshire, surrounded by 2,000 acres woods. It was a dream. Then she told me, but it has no electricity. And water it has only when the windmill goes, to get the water down. It was so lovely, it\u2019s -- the first time, of course, we were together. And then we were also some weekends, I think, together. And they saw that my husband repaired everything, whether it was on the roof, or whatever was to be repaired, he was very handy. And I, of course, cleaned the house. So we got the key. Until six -- 69, we -- my whole family went there. We always spent all of the holidays there together, the whole family. They came from New York, the Streichers with the -- then with the children, afterwards with the grandchildren. We had the house all the time, very seldom they went because they had a yacht, where they were in summer. In winter we couldn\u2019t, in the -- when it was snow. And when mud was, we had the Jeeps they had there. So we left our car up, and -- but the first year, \u00b047, when she asked me whether we want to use it, a f -- a farm, we had no car. They [indecipherable] another to -- pupil to ask me, would you care to use my car? I go on the cruise. So we had a car of another pupil. I thought that the [indecipherable] were terrific to us, really terrific. To let the house have us. All the time we were there. They moved then to Maine, so got -- first they lived on Brattle Street.
