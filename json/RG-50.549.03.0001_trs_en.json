            "question": "United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, this is a follow-up interview to an interview with Thomas Buergenthal conducted by Katie Davis in 1995. This follow-up interview is conducted by Regina Baier, with Judge Buergenthal, on February 27\", 2001. My first question is very open and we\u2019ll see how simple it is. But it is, where are we?",
            "answer": "We\u2019re at the International Court of Justice, in The Hague, in my office at the court, on a very sort of dark, dre -- dreary day."

            "question": "And this is your place of work, and what do you do here, what is your work?",
            "answer": "Well, my work on the court -- I\u2019d have to actually go back and explain a little something about the court. The court was established already by the League of Nations in- in early 1920\u2019s. It\u2019s a court where you deal only with disputes between states. And we also render advisory opinions for the United Nations, but basically disputes between states. We -- we have quite a number of cases pending now, and we hear cases. Since getting to the court in March, I\u2019ve already sat on -- on five very important cases, including a case involving Germany and the United States."

            "question": "That was a very good lead-in to a follow-up question I had. Could you give us one or two examples of the kinds of cases that you\u2019re working on right now? Interview with Thomas Buergenthal \u00b0 February 27, 2001",
            "answer": "Ri -- at this very moment, actually, we -- we are in the process of finishing a dispute between Qatar and Bahrain, those are disputes relating to territorial and maritime -- the limitation questions. That is to say, the countries want the court to determine certain disputed issues relating to their territory and also to their -- their sea. At the same time we are dealing with a case between Germany and the United States in which Germany brought an action against the United States because of the execution of two young Germans who were not given -- or allegedly not given an opportunity to consult the German consular authorities. So the allegation is a breach of the -- of the Vienna convention on that subject. We\u2019ve also recently dealt with a case that 1s still -- well, we'll be hearing oral arguments involving an international arrest warrant issued by Belgium against the foreign minister -- former foreign minister of the Congo, charging him with crimes against humanity and war crimes. And the issue is whether Belgium had the right to -- to issue these -- these arrest warrants. So those are the type of cases we deal with, we- the first case on which I sat here related to an aerial dispute between India and Pakistan."

Or years ago, I forgot now, there were very few cases, you worked on just one or two, and now you have very m -- a lot of work to do. Why is that? Interview with Thomas Buergenthal , February 27, 2001",
            "answer": "Well, I of course am -- am new at the court, but in the days of the Cold War, basically since the second World War, initially there were very, very few cases coming, and that was because of the Cold War. And I think governments had the sense that this would be an ideologically divided court, and that justice would not really be done properly. Once the Cold War ended, cases started to come, and also I should tell you from what I\u2019ve heard that the atmosphere on the court is very different than it was at the height of the Cold War. I-It\u2019s a much easier, much more judicial type of -- of environment than it must have been, I -- I don\u2019t know."

            "answer": "In many ways it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a different direction. I\u2019ve -- as you know, I -- I was a judge on the inter-American court of human rights. I\u2019ve also sat on the UN Human Rights Committee. And thi -- this is very much an strictly international court, but human rights issues can arise, but a lot of other cases come as well.

            "answer": "It\u2019s a dream in the sense that I think there isn\u2019t an international lawyer who wouldn\u2019t want to be on this court, because it is really -- 1-it\u2019s like being on the Supreme Court of the United States. This is the court that determines what is and what is not international law. Not that we are that 1m-important, but in -- in terms of those of us who believe in international law, and -- and practice international law, this is the -- the Mecca to which you look."

I -- I think it would be totally Interview with Thomas Buergenthal \u00b0 February 27, 2001 arrogant for anybody to believe that you\u2019re going to be here. You dream about it. At my age you stop dreaming about it even, and then suddenly I -- I was named. Actually, I should tell you that the notice to me that I was going to be the nominee of the United States for the court came to me while I was -- had just done a visit to Auschwitz, my second visit. And I was in Krakow, had just come back from it, in the evening, in the hotel when I received the call from the legal advisory. That was very special."

My wife and I have always said that we -- that we could live almost ev - anyplace, but I -- I think as we get older we probably should be a little more restrictive. But -- but it\u2019s certainly a -- a -- one -- one couldn\u2019t ask for a more enjoyable environment. We miss our children, we miss our grandchildren, we have eight grandchildren and they keep coming, so that part. But life here, and the working environment 1s certainly wonderful. I miss my students, actually. I don\u2019t miss exams, I don\u2019t miss that part, but I miss not having classes and seminars. Because this existence here, to some extent is quite lonely.

            "answer": "No, we -- w-we -- I\u2019ve come back many a time. I didn\u2019t think that I was going to live here. I -- I once had a possibility, it looked like a possibility to -- to serve on the European court of human rights, and we debated the issue of whether we would live in Europe. But it never seemed like a difficult choice if one had -- if the -- 1f what one was asked to do was interesting enough, the -- the living environment didn\u2019t play that much of a role. But I must say, one couldn\u2019t really ask for a nicer place to be than here in the -- in the Netherlands."

            "answer": "Yes, it was in -- in December of 1951, that\u2019s exactly 50 years ago this year. We were on one of the troop carriers, the transports, the liberty boats. It was the SS General Greeley, | still remember the name. And I think it was a -- a 10 day trip from Bremerhaven to -- to New York, with a lot of refugees, people from all over, from eastern Europe, [indecipherable] even -- I have some pictures still. And it was a very scary experience except that I knew I was coming to -- to live with my uncle, and in that sense it -- it -- and I was young, so it wasn\u2019t as scary as what it must have been for -- for a lot of other people. But also the life on the boat was very interested. I -- I managed to get myself a interpreter\u2019s job so I didn\u2019t have to paint and scrub the floors. And it was a lot of fun, and va -- I was writing for the -- for the news -- ship newspaper. So from that point Interview with Thomas Buergenthal \u2018 February 27, 2001 of view it was all exciting. I really had no idea what awaited me in the United States, whether I would stay in the United States. It was adventure at the age of 17."

            "answer": "It was strange, we got on the boat and people were told they had to scrub the decks, paint the ship and do all these things. But they needed people who could annou -- make announcements in different languages and so I volunteered for that. That\u2019s --"

One thing that we were all served American food, of course, for breakfast and they had these lovely boxes of cereal, these single cereal things. None of us knew what to do with that, and so after we ate breakfast, we hi -- we carry -- walked around with these boxes and thought that that was dessert. That\u2019s what I remember from my ship experience. But arriving in New York, you know, the -- and we- we S -- we Sat -- we actually arrived in the evening, so we -- we weren\u2019t unloaded, couldn\u2019t disembark until the next morning. And to see New York with the -- all the lights and everything, was quite -- 1-1n some ways exciting, in some ways it brought back memories of the past, and I -- I\u2019ve often thought about that -- that moment, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s further and further away now, I had to reread what I had written at -- at that moment about it.

And I didn\u2019t know where I was and where I was going and what the address was.

It di -- wonders to -- it was a marvel, you just couldn't get over it, that sort of life. And also the thing that, to me, somebody who\u2019s gone through the camp was the most striking, if you ordered a salami sandwich, you got about an inch of salami, whereas I remember at home, 1-1f you were lucky you got a very thin slice of whatever meat there was on the -- on the sandwich. Or liverwurst sandwiches. And ice cream. Those were things that I just hadn\u2019t seen and couldn\u2019t believe that that existed. So that was the most impressive part."

The -- the school in Germany was very formal, the teachers -- everything was done in a very disciplined, formal way. This sort of class president or speaker was designated by the -- by the teacher. And there was this very democratic life in -- in the American, everything was voted on. The academics may not have been as high possibly as in -- as in Germany, but as a -- as a teaching ground for -- for democracy, it -- 1t was quite an experience, it opened my eyes to -- to what a good high school can do in teaching citizenship more than necessarily academics.

You have to go and work first and earn enough money to go to school.\u201d Well, that was the last I ever went to see her again, because I didn\u2019t -- I thought that was just a complete waste of time to get that sort of advice. I -- I -- I did well in -- wi -- my grades were good, and I had a very good advisor in the -- a college advisor 1-1n the school. And she said -- and I knew I wanted to go to college, I mean there was no question that I wanted to do it, and how I was going to do it, that was another thing, but I knew I was going to do it. A -- so she said, well, I\u2019ll give you -- and I had no idea how you went about it, I -- you know, 1 -- Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Thomas Buergenthal \" February 27, 2001 and since my relatives had not gone to college here, they ha -- couldn\u2019t really advise me. So the -- the advisor, the academic advisor said, \u201cIll give you the names of 10 schools. And they are smaller schools because it would be better for you to go to a smaller college where they\u2019d have -- where you\u2019d get acclimated, you\u2019d be part of amer,\u201d -- which was very wise advice. And she gave me those 10 schools, and I -- and she told me what to do, so you write in and I asked for the catalog. I did that, and I -- and da -- there was some very fine schools like Colgate, Hamilton College and s-schools of that type. And one of the schools was Bethany College in -- in West Virginia. The other schools that I\u2019d written to, most of them with -- I knew I couldn\u2019t go unless I had a scholarship. All the other schools admitted me, but they said we can only give you a scholarship in th -- in a year when we know how your academic performance is going to be, which I guess made sense because I really didn\u2019t much of an academic pedigree. But it meant that I really couldn't -- couldn\u2019t go. And Bethany College was a school to which I\u2019d written and asked for the catalog. The catalog came back and it started out by saying this is a Christian college, and so coming from Europe I assumed that that was not a college where they wanted me. And so I didn\u2019t do anything, I put it aside.

So I went and spoke with him, and the first thing he said to me was, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send -- fill out your application?\u201d And I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to put this, because it Interview with Thomas Buergenthal : February 27, 2001 was a little delicate, and finally I said, \u201cLook, I am Jewish. You are a Christian college, and I imagine you\u2019d -- you wouldn\u2019t want me.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re missing the point, this is America, w-we -- we -- we find your background interesting, we want you to come, we can arrange scholarships for you, and if you work, you can -- and none of this costs too much, you could come to Bethany with no money at all and get through school.\u201d And they were -- so I applied, I got the scholarship, they -- they gave me a job and for the next three and a half years I spend one semester in Washington.

            "question": "And this is tape two of the follow-up interview with Judge Buergenthal, conducted by Regina Baier on February 27\", 2001. And in 1970, I believe, I seem to remember in 1970 you began representing the U.S. government at the UNESCO in human rights matters. And how did that come about and what -- could you give us an example of the kind of things that you were involved in then.",
            "answer": "Yes, it -- it was around in the early 1970\u2019s, that I -- I was teaching -- at that point I was still teaching at Buffalo, at the state university of New York, and one of the lawyers in town who became a good friend of mine was -- received a political appointment to serve on the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission. And he knew very little about international human rights, but was very interested. And so he asked me to brief him, and give him backgrounds on -- on what was happening in the human rights field in the world at the time, which I did. And then after that experience that he had, he became a member of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO, which was sort of the state department\u2019s private support body for -- for UNESCO. And he involved me in the work, and he -- he is -- he became the chairman of their human rights committee, and made me a member of the -- of the committee. And than I was elected, eventually, to the -- to the U.S. national commission, and then I succeeded him as -- as chairman of the commission. In the meantime, in 1974, I was asked to chair a U.S. delegation to a UNESCO meeting. And what we were doing there basically -- this was of course at the height of the -- of Interview with Thomas Buergenthal * February 27, 2001 Cold War, were the -- human rights was not something -- human rights was basically used in many quarters just as a propaganda tool, one way or the other. And m-my delegation, we -- we tried to -- to do it right. We -- we managed to get -- they had a draft that had been prepared, we managed to get 82 amendments adopted for it. My -- my -- my colleague at the time was a -- was a professor of child psychology who had done a lot of work on children\u2019s attitudes -- international attitudes. And we worked this -- and we lobbied, and we managed to actually get a great deal done, to everybody\u2019s surprise because I think when we were put on this delegation everybody thought this was just giving a few people a free trip to Paris, but nothing was going to come out of it. And when we came back, we suggested to the U.S. government -- because we then managed to adopt the resolution that -- that should be written up. The -- and the -- the people at the state department, in charge of UNESCO said to us, well why don\u2019t you write it up? And that produced a book on this recommendation that had been -- that had been adopted, and led to my involvement and -- on human rights issues -- anything relating to human rights at UNESCO at that point, I was involved in one way or the other. Eventually, up to really 1960 -- no, let me see, \u201978 - \u201979, when I was elected to the inter-American court, and I was -- I dre -- I was part of the -- I was th -- chairing the delegation of the U.S. that managed to adopt rules for private appeals to UNESCO for human rights violations. Again things that nobody thought we were going to be able to get through, but it was adopted. It was very exciting, it was my first experience in an international gu -- inter- Interview with Thomas Buergenthal ~ February 27, 2001 governmental forum. And that\u2019s where I began, really, to get some practical experience in international human rights as a government representative. And it was -- wa -- 1n sense, wonderful to be there representing the -- the U.S. because I could see my colleagues from the east particularly, who had to continuously check their instructions and had to adhere to their instructions and I also had the feeling that if they made a mistake they would end up being in Siberia, whereas all that could happen to me would be that I wouldn\u2019t be put on the next delegation. But you had much more freedom to negotiate, and I thought we -- we achieved some things, and it -- in these -- this context, I learned very early in those days that you -- you c -- you shouldn\u2019t have great expectations of great achievement, but step by step, you put one brick on top of the other, a-and you get some things done. And in those days it was easier to talk about human rights education, because it was not seen by many of the dictatorial governments as being threatening. What they didn\u2019t realize is that in the long run human rights education is much more dangerous to them than some more advocacy oriented course, because if you begin to teach children about -- that they have rights, that can have an impact. And so we f -- I focused on that for -- for awhile. But that was -- I found that as a -- a fascinating experience. Then of course, at some point, the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO. I was elected to the inter-American court of human rights, and had to stop my involvement with UNESCO. I always thought it was a mistake that we left UNESCO, the U.S., I mean."

Could you say something about that particular court, and what -- what you did was -- what your involvement was there?",
            "answer": "Well, I should tell you first how I got on the court, or rather it -- it\u2019s just interesting. I - at that point I was teaching at the University of Texas in Austin at their law school. And I -- I used to teach a seminar every year on international human rights, and one part of the seminar dealt with the inter-American system. And I would in every seminar say what a pity it was that the U.S. had not ratified the American convention on human rights, because it meant that an American would never sit on the inter-American court of human rights. And then one day I was sitting in my office on one of those sunny days in - hot days in Texas and the phone rang, and somebody with a Latin American accent identified himself as coming from the embassy of Costa Rica, and said that he was calling to ask whether I would permit Costa Rica the honor of nominating me to the inter-American court of human rights. And I was sure it was one of my students playing games with me. So I very carefully said, \u201cOf course, Mr. Ambassador, I\u2019m profoundly Interview with Thomas Buergenthal 7 February 27, 2001 honored, but I need to speak to my wife.\u201d You know, one of those things. And, \u201cWould you mind giving me your telephone number that I -- I will call you back.\u201d And of course, as soon as he gave me the telephone number, I checked to see what the telephone number was for the embassy of Costa Rica, and it was really Costa Rica. And I -- I think I accepted the next day. I thought it was nice to -- to wait. And that\u2019s how I ended up on the court. I had actually been interested in being on the commission, like -- the inter- American human rights system has a commission and a court, and on the commission, the U.S. does have a representative. A -- a member. And so I tha -- that was my hope, I never expected to be on the court. The great thing, and the reason I said it was such a wonderful experience, I was one of the seven first members of the court. We established the court. We held our first meeting in the bathhouse of the Costa Rican bar association. We had one typewriter, that\u2019s how it started. And it\u2019s now -- and then for the next -- I had two terms, and I was re-nominated by Costa Rica and by Columbia and I served for -- for 12 years on the court, and we really laid -- in those -- we had some bi -- I had some wonderful colleagues, and we laid the groundwork for a human rights tribunal which today is playing an important role. It\u2019s not as significant still as the -- as the European Court of Human Rights, which 1s much older now, but it is doing some good, and it\u2019s trying to -- to have an important role 1n -- in Latin America, particularly. So in that sense, to -- to be at the inception of all of this, it was a tremendous experience."

And it -- 1t was -- this was- these were cases involving disappearances in Honduras that had taken place in -- between 1979 and \u201982, in -- during that period. And the -- the cases carried on for a number of years, but the decision that we rendered was -- was really the f -- the first international decisions dealing with the whole issue of disappearances. And we awarded damages to the families of the disappeared, they were -- they were killed. And I had then the great satisfaction, after I was no longer on the court, of receiving the payment on behalf of the court, from the government of Honduras, the compensation payment that was still due to the victims. That was much later, th-that was -- took place in Washington. That is a -- you have a sense you\u2019ve done something.

The -- the war in El Salvador lasted for 12 years, but we were asked after the -- the peace accords had been signed to investigate what had happened during those 12 years. And th-there were three of us, basically, were the members of the commission,; a former president of Columbia and a former foreign minister of Venezuela and I, with a staff. And basically our job was to -- to try to determine responsibility on both sides, on the guerilla side and on the government side for some of the terrible acts that happened, for example, the killing of the archbishop Romero, the killing of the Jesuits, the -- the rapes and killings of the church women. The El Mozote massacre, the killings by the [indecipherable] of various mayors, and so that -- that was our job. And there, in various contexts, the Holocaust came back. I -- I remember the one survivor whom we interviewed on the massacre of El Mozote, it was in the -- in the hills where they murdered -- it\u2019s very hard to say, I would think about 800 people. The woman who was describing that started talking about how it happened, and I could have finished the story in terms of my own experience, what the soldiers were doing, how they were doing it. It was just as if I -- if I had been there. Similar things with, for example, the killing of the Jesuits. I remember -- I had just been Interview with Thomas Buergenthal \u201c February 27, 2001 in Auschwitz about a year earlier and had told my wife how -- we -- we came to Auschwitz, this was in May, and I said to her, you know what is most unbelieving about Birkenau where I was, that the grass is growing, it\u2019s about two, three feet high and birds are flying. When I was in Auschwitz, there was not -- there was only mud, and there were no birds because of the smoke from the crematorium. When we were in El Salvador, in the courtyard where they had executed the Jesuit fathers, somebody pointed to a tower where supposedly there\u2019d been ob-observers, and he said -- this was a -- a -- th-the courtyard they had planted roses. And they said, right over there, over the bushes, and -- but it\u2019s now overgrown, you can\u2019t see it. And it brought back Auschwitz. You couldn\u2019t see what had happened in Auschwitz. So one doesn\u2019t lose those things in different environments, but -- and it came back in many contexts, in context of people in El Salvador. I\u2019ve never heard in -- anybody in El] Salvador say that they were sorry for what they did. They only said that it was a mistake. Wa -- I\u2019ve never quite understood what that meant, that it was a mistake that if they had done it better, I suppose they could have -- and those are the things we are struggling with, we are dealing with when we are dealing with human rights violations, that we have to create in the world a sense that these are no -- not mistakes. These are terrible things for which people should be sorry, and they should know that they will be, that they\u2019Il be on their conscience and they shouldn\u2019t be doing them.

            "answer": "First of all, somebody who really knows his stuff as a lawyer. One of the big damage that -- mu-much damage has been done to human rights advocacy by people who politicize it as lawyers. I mean, it\u2019s all right if you\u2019re a politician and you want to politicize it, but the job of a lawyer, particularly in investigating and bringing claims has to be one that is as professional and sound, professionally lawyer-like as you can be, because you -- if you\u2019re not, you open yourself up to charges your -- you weaken your case. And that -- a lot of that used to happen because we didn\u2019t have trained human rights lawyers around, so people would make big speeches and claim that they had found certain things, and then they were proved wrong and -- and they suffered in terms of prestige. So to my mind the most important thing is for lawyers in this business to Interview with Thomas Buergenthal \u201c\u00b0 February 27, 2001 recognize that they have to be as good lawyers in that field as if they ran in corporations, anti-trust lawyers, tax lawyers. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the first requirement. The second requirement is that you really have to have empathy. You have to feel that -- that this is something that is important, that this 1s -- this isn\u2019t just like any other field of the law, that this is something where you -- you have to put your heart into it, and you don\u2019t have to necessarily work as a human rights lawyer to do that, you could work for a corporation, you can be in a big law firm, and you can on the side do a lot of good, human rights work. But you have to believe in it."

Could you say something about when that was, and what you actually did?",
            "answer": "Yes, I think that was in 1992 or 91, I\u2019m not sure, we\u2019 ll have to ask her. We -- we decided to go to my birthplace, which is in Slovakia in ot -- in a little resort town called Lubochnia. And we decided to go to -- to Auschwitz, and to Kielce where I was in -- in the ghetto, and some other towns where I had been during the war. Lubochnia, where I was born, m-my father came there, and he and a friend of his brother bought a hotel there, believing that Hitler wouldn\u2019t last more than a few years, and so they would be close by, and | -- I was born there, but -- and I left there when I was four years old. So going back to this little place in the mountains in Slovakia, in the lower Tatra mountains wa-was sort of a surrealistic experience. I knew I was born there, but I had no connection to it. There was nobody there that lived there that -- that knew my family. My father had been there for a relatively short time, from 1933 until 38. We couldn\u2019t find the hotel, because it -- th -- we think we found the hotel, but it looked very different from the picture we had. And so 1-1t was a strange experience. I took a picture of myself standing under the sign that said, Lubochnia as you entered the town, but there was no -- 1-it -- it\u2019s really a strange experience, I -- I never thought that it would be that strange an experience, because you -- this is where one was born, these are one\u2019s roots, but they are not really roots, they\u2019re just like somebody cut the -- the roots and left them in the ground, but there is no -- no connection at all. Auschwitz turned out to be easier than I expected. I was at Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 that point thinking seriously, and I was doing some writing on the subject. And we -- we went to Auschwitz debating whether I should go or not because of memories that would be destroyed in some ways by seeing it now from what I had envisage. And we came in -- we went first to Auschwitz I, which was really not the camp where I was, but I was in -- in Birkenau. And -- and I was very afraid of the impact it would have on me. And then my wife saw a sign that said archives, and she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go in and introduce yourself?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want t -- I want to be a tourist, ye -- I just want to go through.\u201d And she insisted, and when she insists, I usually end up doing what she wants me to do. So I went in and I introduced myself, and they got very excited because they were just working on a project relating to children in Auschwitz. So they wanted to know where I had been. I didn\u2019t know exactly when I arrived in Auschwitz, and I thought by looking at where I came from and my name, that they would have it. And they said by the time I arrived, it -- they no longer had names, but what was my number? And by reference to my number they pinpointed exactly when I had gotten to Auschwitz, the date, the number of people that were on my transport, and suddenly my stay in Auschwitz had become an academic exercise, and was you know -- you know, we were discussing, the director came and wanted to know, you know, where -- they had a big map and they wanted me to find where I had been in different camps and -- in Birkenau. And then they actually put a -- gave us a guide, and we -- we -- we did the -- did the trip together. But what was so -- first of all, of course, ous -- Birkenau looks very different Interview with Thomas Buergenthal ~ February 27, 2001 now than it was, apart from the fact, you know, the trees and the grass that I mentioned. Most of barracks are not there any more. You just have a few examples, and I -- I had pointed out to my wife that I remembered we used to go in to the latrine, which was the only warm place in all of Auschwitz, to warm ourselves, and that they would chase us out after five minutes. Nobody could stay there, and I tried to describe it to her, and there it was, th-there was the barrack on -- as I\u2019d remembered, and the mud. That, you know, was striking. We went to -- to a place in Birkenau when -- where we came in, the -- the sauna where we -- and I remember saying -- the -- the fellow said, this is the entrance. And I said to him no -- [ said to my wife, this isn\u2019t the entrance, I came in through an entrance that had a pool, where you had to -- disinfecting pool, and it was quite deep and you had to go in -- and he said, \u201cNo, no, this was the entrance.\u201d And we walked around, and there is another -- there is a pool, and there is a door that was blocked off, and that was where I\u2019d entered. He said, \u201cOh yes, this 1s the door.\u201d And of course it wasn\u2019t deep at all. It was maybe 10 centimeters pool. But to me as a child, you know, I was 10 years old- not even 10 years old, 1t seemed like a very deep -- deep pool. I wi -- I had the same experience in the ghetto in Kielce. What my wife found so surprising was, I am very bad on directions. I -- I can -- 1 -- by -- in my family if I say turn left, all the kids say turn right. So, you know, nobody ever listens to me when I say how you find something. We drive into Kielce, this town in Poland, and my wife says, \u201cWell what now? Should we ask somebody where the ghetto was?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, just drive down,\u201d -- [tape break] Interview with Thomas Buergenthal ~ February 27, 2001"

What was disheartening to me was that this was a ghetto in which more then 20,000 Jews had been -- had been shipped to Treblinka from there, including my grandparents. There wasn\u2019t one monument to indicate where the ghetto was. Disgraceful, really. It\u2019s really part of the history of Kielce and I -- I went to the museum then, to -- to try to find something about the ghetto and they did say, oh yes, we had an exhibit here not long ago. We have this little book that was still prepared in communist days. But nothing that shows this is where there was population that has been killed. We -- there were only about five hundred that survived the -- the ghetto of Kielce. That\u2019s disheartening, you know.

And thi -- this is what I felt in -- in that ti -- I couldn't wait to get Interview with Thomas Buergenthal ~ February 27, 2001 out of there. I -- I found it harder to take than -- than Auschwitz. I should tell you that I went back to Auschwitz, because I mentioned that I was actually called in right after an - asec -- my second visit to Auschwitz that I was going to be sitting on this -- or that I was nominated by the U.S., and that was because a -- a British journalist and -- who decided that he wanted to write a book about me insisted that I go to Auschwitz on the -- to coincide with the date of the Death March out of Auschwitz, on which I was.

Because I was dressed in the heaviest jacket with sweaters, with hat, and I was freezing, and I was there as a child with a little blanket and thin prison uniform. And -- and I made it.

Again, I thought it should be in Germany and- and not in Washington. Since then I\u2019ve come to the conclusion I\u2019ve been wrong. Not that it shouldn\u2019t -- that there shouldn\u2019t be one in Germany, but they -- the museum has been a tremen -- has had an tremendous educational impact on people in the United States, in terms of educating them to what happened. When I would go to meetings at the museum to -- to -- you know, we had council meetings and committee meetings, it was always impressive to see the thousands of kids lining up to go to the museum. And the hush that fell over them when they -- when they went in. So -- and -- and | think in -- in five years there were more than eight million people that had come to the museum. So I think it\u2019s had a tremendous impact. That Committee on Conscience was something that was very close to my heart, because I feel very strongly that the museum shouldn\u2019t be just a -- a cemetery. The museum has to be a living organism that tries to make sure that these things don\u2019t happen again. And that means also, speaking out to -- to where other crimes against humanity and genocide is being committed. And we have an obligation as survivors, and we owe it to the people who died to make sure that these things don\u2019t happen in other places.

And that is that somebody with my background should be involved in these things. That I should be on the Truth Commission for El Salvador, that I should be on the Inter- American Court of Human Rights, that I should sit on the UN Human Rights Committee. That -- in a sense wh-what is impressive about it is not my career in that those things are often happenstance and anything else.
