And I think governments had the sense that this would be an ideologically divided court, and that jus tice would not really be done properly. Once the Cold War ended, cases started to come , and also I should tell you from what I\u2122ve heard that the atmosphere on the court is very different than it was at the height of the Cold War. I-It\u2122s a much easier, much more judicial type of -- of environment than it must have been, I -- I don\u2122t know. ",

You have to go and work first and earn enough money to go to school.\ufb02 Well, that was the last I ever went to see her again, because I didn\u2122t -- I thought that was just a complete waste of time to get that sort of advice. I -- I -- I did well in -- wi -- my grades were good, and I had a very good advisor in the -- a college a dvisor i-in the school. And she said -- and I knew I wanted to go to college, I mean there was no question that I wanted to do it, and how I was going to do it, that was another thi ng, but I knew I was going to do it. A -- so she said, well, I\u2122ll give you -- and I had no idea how you went about it, I -- you know, i -- Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 14and since my relatives had not gone to college here, they ha -- couldn\u2122t really advise me.

And she gave me those 10 sc hools, and I -- and she told me what to do, so you write in and I asked for the catalog. I did that, and I -- and da -- there was some very fine schools like Colgate , Hamilton College and s-schools of that type. And one of the schools was Bethany College in -- in West Virginia. The other schools that I\u2122d written to, most of them with -- I knew I couldn\u2122t go unless I had a scholarship. All the other schools admitted me, but they said we can only give you a scholarship in th -- in a year when we know how your academic perfo rmance is going to be, which I guess made sense because I really didn\u2122t much of an academic pedigree. But it meant that I really couldn't -- couldn\u2122t go. And Bethany College was a school to which I\u2122d written and asked for the catalog. The catalog came back and it started out by saying this is a Christian college, and so coming from Europe I assumed that that was not a college where they wanted me. And so I didn\u2122t do an ything, I put it aside. Then one day in -- when I was in class in high school, I get a call from the academic advisor saying that there is somebody from Bethany College downstairs in her office and he wants to speak to me. So I went and spoke with him, and the first thing he said to me was, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t you send -- fill out your application?\ufb02 And I wasn\u2122t quite sure how to put this, because it Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 15was a little delicate, and finally I said, \ufb01Look, I am Jewish. You are a Christian college, and I imagine you\u2122d -- you wouldn\u2122t want me .\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Well, you\u2122re missing the point, this is America, w-we -- we -- we find your background interesting, we want you to come, we can arrange scholarships for you, and if you work, you can -- and none of this costs too much, you could come to Bethany with no money at all and get through school.\ufb02 And they were -- so I applied, I got the scholarship, they -- they gave me a job and for the next three and a half years I spend one semester in Washington .

And in 1970, I believe, I seem to remember in 1970 you began representing the U.S. government at the UNESCO in human rights matters. And how did that come about and what -- could you give us an example of the kind of things that you were involved in then.",
            "answer": "Yes, it -- it was around in the early 1970\u2122s , that I -- I was teaching -- at that point I was still teaching at Buffalo, at the state university of New York , and one of the lawyers in town who became a good friend of mine was -- received a political appointment to serve on the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission. And he knew very little about international human rights, but was very interested. And so he asked me to brief him, and give him backgrounds on -- on what was happening in the human rights field in the world at the time, which I did. And then after that experience that he had, he became a member of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO, which was sort of the state department\u2122s private support body for -- for UNESCO. And he involved me in the work, and he -- he is -- he became the chairman of their human rights committee, and made me a member of the -- of the committee. And than I was elected, eventually, to the -- to the U.S. national commission, and then I succeeded him as -- as chairman of the commission. In the meantime, in 1974, I was asked to chair a U.S. delegation to a UNESCO meeting. And what we were doing there basically -- this was of course at the height of the -- of Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 33Cold War, were the -- human rights was not something -- human rights was basically used in many quarters just as a propaga nda tool, one way or the other. And m-my delegation, we -- we tried to -- to do it right. We -- we managed to get -- they had a draft that had been prepared, we managed to ge t 82 amendments adopted for it. My -- my -- my colleague at the time was a -- was a professor of child psycholo gy who had done a lot of work on children\u2122s attitudes -- international attitudes. And we worked this -- and we lobbied, and we managed to actually get a great deal done, to everybody\u2122s surprise because I think when we were put on this delegation everybody thought this was just giving a few people a free trip to Paris, but nothing was going to come out of it. And when we came back, we suggested to the U.S. government -- because we then managed to adopt the resolution that -- that should be written up. The -- and the -- the people at the state department, in charge of UNESCO said to us, well why don\u2122t you write it up? And that produced a book on this recommendation th at had been -- that had been adopted, and led to my involvement and -- on human rights issues -- anything relating to human rights at UNESCO at that point, I was involved in one way or the other. Eventually, up to really 1960 -- no, let me see, \u212278 - \u212279, when I was elected to the inter-American court, and I was -- I dre -- I was part of the -- I was th -- chairing the delegation of the U.S. that managed to adopt rules for private appeals to UNESCO for human rights violations. Again things that nobody thought we were going to be able to get through, but it was adopted. It was very exciting, it was my first experience in an international gu -- inter Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 34governmental forum. And that\u2122s where I began, really, to get some practical experience in international human rights as a government re presentative. And it was -- wa -- in sense, wonderful to be there representing the -- the U.S. because I could see my colleagues from the east particularly, who had to continuously check their instructions and had to adhere to their instructions and I also had the feeling that if they made a mistake they would end up being in Siberia, whereas all that could happen to me would be that I wouldn\u2122t be put on the next delegation. But you had much more freedom to negotiate, and I thought we -- we achieved some things, and it -- in these -- this context, I learned very early in those days that you -- you c -- you shouldn\u2122t have gr eat expectations of great achievement, but step by step, you put one brick on top of th e other, a-and you get some things done. And in those days it was easier to talk about human rights education, because it was not seen by many of the dictatorial governments as being threatening. What they didn\u2122t realize is that in the long run human rights education is much more dangerous to them than some more advocacy oriented course, because if you begin to teach children about -- that they have rights, that can have an impact. And so we f -- I focused on that for -- for awhile. But that was -- I found that as a -- a fascina ting experience. Then of course, at some point, the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO. I was elected to the inter-American court of human rights, and had to stop my involvement with UNESCO. I always thought it was a mistake that we left UNESCO, the U.S., I mean."

Could you say something about that particular court, and what -- what you did was -- what your involvement was there?",
            "answer": "Well, I should tell you first how I got on the court, or rather it -- it\u2122s just interesting. I -- at that point I was teaching at the University of Texas in Austin at their law school. And I -- I used to teach a seminar every year on international human rights, and one part of the seminar dealt with the inter-American system. And I would in every seminar say what a pity it was that the U.S. had not ratified the Amer ican convention on human rights, because it meant that an American w ould never sit on the inter-American court of human rights. And then one day I was sitting in my office on one of those sunny days in -- hot days in Texas and the phone rang, and somebody with a Latin American accent identified himself as coming from the embassy of Costa Rica, and said that he was calling to ask whether I would permit Costa Rica the honor of nominating me to the inter-American court of human rights. And I was sure it was one of my students playing games with me. So I very carefully said, \ufb01Of course, Mr. Ambassador, I\u2122m profoundly Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 37honored, but I need to speak to my wife.\ufb02 You know, one of those things. And, \ufb01Would you mind giving me your telephone number that I -- I will call you back.\ufb02 And of course, as soon as he gave me the telephone number, I checked to see what the telephone number was for the embassy of Costa Rica, and it was really Costa Rica. And I -- I think I accepted the next day. I thought it was nice to -- to wait. And that\u2122s how I ended up on the court. I had actually been interested in being on the commi ssion, like -- the inter-American human rights system has a commission an d a court, and on the commission, the U.S. does have a representative. A -- a member. And so I tha -- that was my hope, I never expected to be on the court. The great thing, and the reason I said it was such a wonderful experience, I was one of the seven first member s of the court. We established the court. We held our first meeting in the bathhouse of the Costa Rican bar association. We had one typewriter, that\u2122s how it started. And it\u2122s now -- and then for the next -- I had two terms, and I was re-nominated by Costa Rica and by Columbia and I served for -- for 12 years on the court, and we really laid -- in those -- we had some bi -- I had some wonderful colleagues, and we laid the groundwork for a human rights tribunal which today is playing an important role. It\u2122s not as significant still as the -- as the European Court of Human Rights, which is much olde r now, but it is doing some good, and it\u2122s trying to -- to have an important role in -- in Latin America, particularly. So in that sense, to -- to be at the inception of all of this, it was a tremendous experience."

And it -- it was -- this was -- these were cases involving disappearances in Honduras that had taken place in -- between 1979 and \u212282, in -- during that pe riod. And the -- the cases carried on for a number of years, but the decision that we rendered was -- was really the f -- the first international decisions dealing with the whole issue of di sappearances.

And I had then the great satisfaction, after I was no longer on the court, of receiving the payment on behalf of the court, from the government of Honduras, the compensation payment that was still due to the victims. That was much later, th-that was -- took place in Washington. That is a -- you have a sense you\u2122ve done something.

The -- the war in El Salvador lasted for 12 years, but we were asked after the -- the peace accords had been signed to investigate what had happened duri ng those 12 years. And th-there were three of us, basically, were the members of the commission,; a former president of Columbia and a former foreign minister of Venezuela and I, with a staff. And basically our job was to -- to try to determine responsibility on both sides, on the guerilla side and on the government side for some of the terrible acts that happened, for example, the killing of the archbishop Romero, the killing of the Jesuits, the -- the rapes and killings of the church women. The El Mozote massacre, the killings by the [indecipherable] of various mayors, and so that -- that was our job. A nd there, in various contexts, the Holocaust came back. I -- I remember the one survivor whom we interviewed on the massacre of El Mozote , it was in the -- in the hills where they murdered -- it\u2122s very hard to say, I would think about 800 people. The woman who was de scribing that started talking about how it happened, and I could have finished the stor y in terms of my own experience, what the soldiers were doing, how they were doing it. It was just as if I -- if I had been there. Similar things with, for example, the killing of the Jesuits. I remember -- I had just been Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 41in Auschwitz about a year earlier and had told my wife how -- we -- we came to Auschwitz, this was in May, and I said to her, you know what is most unbelieving about Birkenau where I was, that the grass is growing, it\u2122s about two, three feet high and birds are flying. When I was in Auschwitz, there was not -- there was only mud, and there were no birds because of the smoke from the crematorium. When we were in El Salvador , in the courtyard where they had executed the Jesuit fathers, somebody pointed to a tower where supposedly there\u2122d been ob-observers, and he said -- this was a -- a -- th-the courtyard they had planted roses. And they said, right over there, over the bushes, and -- but it\u2122s now overgrown, you ca n\u2122t see it. And it brought back Auschwitz. You couldn\u2122t see what had happened in Auschwitz. So one doesn\u2122t lose those things in different environments, but -- and it came back in many contexts , in context of people in El Salvador. I\u2122ve never heard in -- anybody in El Salvador say that they were sorry for what they did. They only said that it was a mistake. Wa -- I\u2122ve never quite understood what that meant, that it was a mistake that if they had done it better, I suppose they could have -- and those are the things we are struggling with, we are dealing with when we are dealing with human rights violations, that we have to create in the world a sense that these are no -- not mistakes. These are terrible things for which peop le should be sorry, and they should know that they will be, that they\u2122ll be on their conscience and they shouldn\u2122t be doing them.

Could you say something about when that was, and what you actually did?",
            "answer": "Yes, I think that was in 1992 or \u212291, I\u2122m not sure, we\u2122ll have to ask her. We -- we decided to go to my birthplace, which is in Slovakia in ot -- in a little resort town called Lubochnia . And we decided to go to -- to Auschwitz, and to Kielce where I was in -- in the ghetto, and some other towns where I had been during the war. Lubochnia , where I was born, m-my father came there, and he and a friend of his brother bought a hotel there, believing that Hitler wouldn\u2122t last more than a few years, and so they would be close by, and I -- I was born there, but -- and I left there when I was four years old. So going back to this little place in the mountains in Slovakia , in the lower Tatra mountains wa-was sort of a surrealistic experience. I knew I wa s born there, but I had no connection to it. There was nobody there that lived there that -- that knew my family. My father had been there for a relatively short time, from 1933 until \u212238. We couldn\u2122t find the hotel, because it -- th -- we think we found the hotel, but it looked very different from the picture we had. And so i-it was a strange experience. I took a picture of myself standing under the sign that said, Lubochnia as you entered the town, but there was no -- i-it -- it\u2122s really a strange experience, I -- I never thought that it would be that strange an experience, because you -- this is where one was born, these are one\u2122s roots, but they are not really roots, they\u2122re just like somebody cut the -- the roots and left them in the ground, but there is no -- no connection at all. Auschwitz turned out to be easier than I expected. I was at Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 51that point thinking seriously, and I was doing some writing on the subject. And we -- we went to Auschwitz debating whether I should go or not because of memories that would be destroyed in some ways by seeing it now from what I had envisage. And we came in -- we went first to Auschwitz , which was really not the camp where I was, but I was in -- in Birkenau. And -- and I was very afraid of the impact it would have on me. And then my wife saw a sign that said archives, and she said, \ufb01Why don\u2122t you go in and introduce yourself?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01No, I don\u2122t want t -- I want to be a tourist, ye -- I just want to go through.\ufb02 And she insisted, and when she in sists, I usually end up doing what she wants me to do. So I went in and I introduced my self, and they got very excited because they were just working on a project relating to children in Auschwitz. So they wanted to know where I had been. I didn\u2122t know exactly when I arrived in Auschwitz, and I thought by looking at where I came from and my name, that they would have it. And they said by the time I arrived, it -- they no longer had names, but what was my number? And by reference to my number they pinpointed exactly when I had gotten to Auschwitz , the date, the number of people that were on my transport, and suddenly my stay in Auschwitz had become an academic exercise, and was you know -- you know, we were discussing, the director came and wanted to know, you know, where -- they had a big map and they wanted me to find where I had been in different camps and -- in Birkenau. And then they actually put a -- gave us a guide, and we -- we -- we did the -- did the trip together. But what was so -- first of all, of course, ous -- Birkenau looks very different Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 52now than it was, apart from the fact, you know, the trees and the grass that I mentioned. Most of barracks are not there any more. You just have a few examples, and I -- I had pointed out to my wife that I remembered we used to go in to the latrine, which was the only warm place in all of Auschwitz, to warm ourselves, and that they would chase us out after five minutes. Nobody could stay there, and I tried to describe it to her, and there it was, th-there was the barrack on -- as I\u2122d remembered, and the mud. That, you know, was striking. We went to -- to a place in Birkenau when -- where we came in, the -- the sauna where we -- and I remember saying -- the -- the fellow said, this is the entrance. And I said to him no -- I said to my wife, this isn\u2122t the entrance, I came in through an entrance that had a pool, where you had to -- disinfecting pool, and it was quite deep and you had to go in -- and he said, \ufb01No, no, th is was the entrance.\ufb02 And we walked around, and there is another -- there is a pool, and th ere is a door that was blocked off, and that was where I\u2122d entered. He said, \ufb01Oh yes, this is the door.\ufb02 And of course it wasn\u2122t deep at all. It was maybe 10 centimeters pool. But to me as a child, you know, I was 10 years old -- not even 10 years old, it seemed like a very deep -- deep pool. I wi -- I had the same experience in the ghetto in Kielce. What my wife found so surprising was, I am very bad on directions. I -- I can -- i -- by -- in my family if I say turn left, all the kids say turn right. So, you know, nobody ever listens to me when I say how you find something. We drive into Kielce, this town in Poland, and my wife says, \ufb01Well what now? Should we ask somebody where the ghetto was?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01No, just drive down,\ufb02 -- [tape break] Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 53"

And on the way, actually driving into Kielce, I suddenly remembered the name of the camp commandant, and a number of other names. And then we f -- I find the street -- the house where I was in the ghetto, where we stayed. And I\u2122d remembered -- I kept saying to -- to Peggy , this is a very -- it was a very tall building, and if -- we got in and it was a three story, small three story apartment house, with -- I remembered the courtyard. It looked just as bad now as it looked then, it -- it wasn\u2122t in any better shape. What was disheartening to me was that this was a ghetto in which more then 20,000 Jews had been -- had been shipped to Treblinka from there, including my grandparents. There wasn\u2122t one monument to indicate where the ghetto was. Disgraceful, really. It\u2122s really part of the history of Kielce and I -- I went to the museum then, to -- to try to find something about the ghetto and they did say, oh yes, we had an exhibit here not long ago. We have this little book that was still prepared in communist days. But nothing that shows this is where there was population that has been killed. We -- there were only about five hundred that survived the -- the ghetto of Kielce. That\u2122s disheartening, you know. It -- it\u2122s -- it\u2122s disheartening because it shows at -- it\u2122s a continuing insult to -- it -- it sort of adds insult to injury when -- when that is -- when there is no attempt to remember what happened here. It\u2122s as if we obliterated all cemeteries. Just think what that would mean to societies, suddenly say there are no cemeteries. And thi -- this is what I felt in -- in that ti -- I couldn't wait to get Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 54out of there. I -- I found it harder to take than -- than Auschwitz . I should tell you that I went back to Auschwitz, because I mentioned that I was ac tually called in right after an -- a sec -- my second visit to Auschwitz that I was going to be sitting on this -- or that I was nominated by the U.S., and that was because a -- a British journalist and -- who decided that he wanted to write a b ook about me insisted that I go to Auschwitz on the -- to coincide with the date of the Death March out of Auschwitz , on which I was.

When we were there on the 20th of January, an -- 21st -- 20th of January of - of nin -- of 2000, it was just as it was -- as I remembered it, in terms of the cold, the road was all ice and all I could think about was, how did I ever su rvive this? Because I was dressed in the heaviest j acket with sweaters, with hat, and I was freezing, and I was there as a child with a little blanket and thin prison uniform. And -- and I made it.

And the issue at that point was debated whether to have a Holocaust Museum in Washington or not. And I thought it was a mistake to have it in Washington. Again, I thought it should be in Germany and -- and not in Washington. Since then I\u2122ve come to the conclusion I\u2122ve been wrong. Not that it shouldn\u2122t -- that th ere shouldn\u2122t be one in Germany, but they -- the museum has been a tremen -- has had an tremendous educational impact on people in the United States, in terms of educating them to what happe ned. When I would go to meetings at the museum to -- to -- you know, we had counc il meetings and committee meetings, it was always impressive to see the thousands of kids lining up to go to the museum. And the hush that fell over them when th ey -- when they went in. So -- and -- and I think in -- in five years there were more than eight million people that had come to the museum. So I think it\u2122s had a tremendous impact. That Co mmittee on Conscience was something that was very close to my heart, because I feel very strongly that the museum shouldn\u2122t be just a -- a cemetery. The museum has to be a living organism that trie s to make sure that these things don\u2122t happen again. And that means also, speaking out to -- to where other crimes against humanity and genocide is being committed. And we have an obligation as survivors, and we owe it to the people who di ed to make sure that these things don\u2122t happen in other places. And so -- and that was really the function of the Committee on Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 57Conscience, and I felt that I -- if -- if -- if that\u2122s not what the Holocaust Museum was doing, then I didn\u2122t want to be connected with it, because I had other things to do.

            "answer": "No, what comes to mind, less dramatic, is the fact that it -- there seems to be some sort of poetry -- not poetic justice, but a certain justice that has poetic, or non-legal aspect to Interview with Thomas Buergenthal February 27, 2001 58it. And that is that somebody with my background should be involved in these things. That I should be on the Truth Commission for El Salvador, that I should be on the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights, that I should sit on the UN Human Rights Committee.

The fact that a survivor of these things can still today have a role in trying to prevent some of these things from happening. That, to me, has always been the sort of significant aspect of -- of my activities. I would sit there and sometimes say gee, this is really, you know -- why was I granted this priv ilege?

This is an -- an example of the fact that one can overcome si -- n-not per -- I personally, bu t that we can overcome some of these murderous things that have happened, and still be able to work for a better world.
