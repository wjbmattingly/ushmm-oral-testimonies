            "answer": "Right. And while we\u2019re hiding in the ghetto, my mother, my father, my baby sister and I, he escapes from concentration camp and manages to get across a railroad track just as a Nazi munitions train was going. So the sentries had shot his finger, but as he was jumping down, they shot him in the hand and shot his finger. And he started running away as the train was coming by. And of course they did not dare fire at that train because there would be a massive explosion. Ok. Then while he was running this was in a woods, a very deep woods in Lvov. And he met a peasant named Mr. Borecki. And Mr. Borecki, a lot of this is in my grandfather\u2019s diary. Mr. Borecki gave him a jacket, rags to wrap around his feet, because my grandfather was a very big man and no shoes could fit him. So and he gave him, and he bandaged his hand and had him sleep in the barn and gave him three breads. And my grandfather said look, I know helping Jews could --. He said well Pll just leave my barn door open. Then if I get asked, I could say I don\u2019t know who sleeps in my barn. So my grandfather did that and the next day he left. And when he was in the woods, oh and he was given a shovel. And in the woods, he was sitting there. And suddenly he heard two or three men speaking Yiddish. And they had escaped an aktion, very near this woods. And one of them had a gun. And they -- my grandfather had been trained for military service as an officer, I guess because he looked good on a horse. The Polish cavalry. He did. And I think that\u2019s why they took him. But anyway, so he was -- they made him the leader. They dug this tunnel and that\u2019s the one that I called the bunker. Ok, it\u2019s a tunnel in this woods, yes. And \u2014"

            "num": 24,
            "question": "How far from the ghetto?",
            "answer": "Quite a ways I think. Because this was in the woods and the ghetto \u2014 now, I'll describe the bunker in just a moment. But when grandfather went back to Mr. Borecki, he asked him two things. One was did he know anything, his -- Mr. Borecki\u2019s son had been killed by the Nazis. Because he was in the resistance, in the Polish resistance. Now but before then he had told his father that the Nazis were going to bomb the ghetto very soon. So my grandfather knew that it was just a matter of time before my father and my mother and my baby sister and I lost our lives. Ok. Now I\u2019m going to switch back and tell you about the bunker. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 8 August 9, 2012 The bunker to me of course it was, I remember cold, damp mud. And there was a ladder to go in and as I remember it, it seemed very tall. Probably it was no more than six feet. And as you walked around, you felt this cold, wet mud. And at one side, here was the entrance. Then there was this cold wet mud. And here at the corner, at the very end, was a fat, was a table, like the kind that electric wire comes on, those spool tables. And I just, I remember it feeling splintery. And I remember the smell of the candle wax because there was a fat candle sitting on that table. And then again some more wet mud. Then like an archway out of mud again and a separate room. On the, as you walked into that room, on the left were things that I later found out were guns. And rifles. What I, and how I, I only knew that I touched them and my grandfather smacked my hand and yelled and he never, ever raised his voice to me, much less his hand. And that\u2019s when I realized those were dangerous. I don\u2019t remember the people in the tunnel. Now I\u2019m going to switch back and tell you. Eventually there were 37 people in the tunnel. But when my grandfather found out that the Nazis were going to bomb the ghetto he asked for volunteers and he, everybody, all the men volunteered, and he took two and they dressed in Nazi uniforms. Well I have to tell you that how they lived at this time was that the men would go out and raid Nazi trucks. They would raise, they would kill the drivers and take \u2014"

            "num": 25,
            "question": "They were escaped from the ghetto.",
            "answer": "They were not in the ghetto. They were in this woods, in the bunker. And they would go out on raids where they would raid Nazi munitions, trucks, outposts. Take whatever, food, clothing, everything. Now the -- at this time the Banderovski who were Ukrainian resistance were in this woods and they were very powerful and they were very numerous and the Nazis would keep trying to bomb and try to get rid of them and they didn\u2019t. So the Nazis thought that these Jews who were raiding them were Banderovski, these Ukrainian resistance fighters. But they were not. Now the Banderovski didn\u2019t like Jews much at all, except they would take Jews if the Jews were doctors. Otherwise, and the agreement was, ok stay out of our way. We\u2019ll stay out of your way kind of thing. We\u2019ll leave you alone. And that\u2019s what happened. Well my grandfather found out that the Nazis from Mr. Borecki who had found out from his son, the Nazis were going to burn the ghetto so he got the two volunteers. They all dressed in Nazi https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 9 August 9, 2012 uniforms, had commandeered a Nazi jeep and drove to the outskirts of the ghetto at night. The two men stayed. My grandfather in Nazi regalia, went into the ghetto, got my mother, my father, my baby sister and me out. Put us in this jeep and brought us to the home of Mr. Borecki. Because my grandfather had spoken to Mr. Borecki and asked him if he would save my mother and the two girls\u2019 lives and he said of course. And so we came in the middle of the night and we were at Mr. Borecki\u2019s house and my mother said I will not leave my husband or you, father. I will not. I\u2019ve already lost my mother. I\u2019m not going to lose you. So they had no choice but all of us now went to the bunker."

            "question": "End of 43?",
            "answer": "Yes, mm hm. Towards the end of 43, right, mm hm. Then apparently and this I hear from my grandfather, my baby sister. Oh there were 37 people in that tunnel. My mother and my father and us. My grandfather\u2019s son, my uncle, his wife. And I think their two boys. They had two boys. My sister and I were the youngest, by far. And I guess we cried and got lice and people were very afraid because we endangered the lives of everybody. And my grandfather felt that he just could not do that. That his family could not endanger everybody else because everyone wanted to live and they had the right to live. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 10 August 9, 2012 So he decided to take us. He had gotten a peasant sheepskin jacket. He dressed himself as a Polish peasant and took my baby sister and me out. I guess according to my grandfather, I had blond hair and dark eyes. My sister had light hair and gray eyes. And he took us both and he went to the local market, looking for someone named Dr. Gruen. Dr. Gruen was a Pole. I think he was Catholic, very famous pediatrician who ran an orphanage for Catholic children. And he looked for, but he couldn\u2019t find him. And he was so desperate and this he writes in his diary. He was so desperate about what to do with us when he couldn\u2019t find Dr. Gruen, that he almost was ready, he was ready to leave us in the market, thinking somebody would find us and keep us. And keep us alive during the war. But just as he was thinking of that, he saw a woman who had been a former neighbor. A Polish Catholic woman whose husband had been killed by the Nazis in one of their mass reprisals. And my grandfather had helped her with her horse and carriage business. So she saw him and recognized him and he brought her to the side where they would not be heard. And of course she said she was so happy to know that he was alive and then he said he had these two children and he couldn\u2019t find Dr. Gruen. And at that point, he said could you take them. And my grandmother had had to sell her house because the people she had working for her were Jews. And they were all in the ghetto and so she couldn\u2019t make a living. So she started working as a cook for a retired engineer and his wife, the Szwarczynskis, somewhere in the country. It must have been near Lvov. And the story they told was that my grandfather was her husband that the two of us were her sister\u2019s children. Now at that time many people were back and forth, going towards the Ukraine and, and so the story she told was that her sisters had gone to Ukraine and left their babies with her. And then she asked Mrs. Szwarczynski could she, could grandma take both. And Mrs. Szwarczynski said yes, she could take me. But she couldn\u2019t take a six month old baby. So my grandfather went, again he asked for how to find Dr. Gruen and this orphanage. And apparently Mr. Szwarczynski knew Dr. Gruen and he told him where the orphanage was and so forth. So grandpa had \u2014 now remember all this time he\u2019s passing as a Polish peasant. Very big one. But the Polish peasant and because my grandfather was six, two and well over 200 pounds. He was -- just an aside. The first time I read Les Miserables, I kept thinking of my grandfather. Because remember Jean Valjean lifts a cart and that\u2019s how Javert knows that he is Jean Valjean. Well my grandfather could lift a car. So I huss? Anyway, sidebar finished.

And I remember putting it on and then following her but then falling asleep, just falling asleep. And this I was told later. That grandma had gone home, thinking that I had probably gone home. And when she didn\u2019t find me there, she was standing outside waiting for me. And ready to go look for me with Mrs. Szwarczynski. And she saw a Nazi soldier, carrying what she thought was my dead body. And so she was about to scream when Mrs. Szwarczynski put her hand over her mouth and told her to stay calm. And the soldier came and at that point I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t know but I woke up. And so grandma was just unbelievably relieved. And the soldier had said that I was asleep and he found me there. And I reminded him of his children back home and so he was bringing me to the closest house because he was sure that\u2019s where I lived. So some kind of way later he had the picture developed and grandma got it and she took that picture, saved it and after the war. And by the way that picture is in the Holocaust Museum. As is a picture of my birth mother, father, uncle and two friends. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 12 August 9, 2012 Well anyway then we were still there with the Szwarczynskis. The Szwarczynskis had a dog. Great big huge German shepherd, really fierce watchdog. So fierce that he was not in the house. He was kept on a chain outdoors and fed with a long stick. And one day, again this I was told. One day the dog was outside and I went over to the dog and my grandmother was about to scream again. And Mrs. Szwarczynski kept her from yelling and I went over to the dog and petted the dog and he started licking me and we became great buddies. Now what I do remember is that when the Nazis came I was told to take the dog and go under the table with the dog. Now one possibility is that, that just as they said to make sure that the dog didn\u2019t remove the Nazi\u2019s leg because he had bitten a Nazi before. The other possibility, although it\u2019s fairly remote is that they suspected I was a Jewish child. But I think that\u2019s fairly remote because they were a bit anti- Semitic also. And my, there was a woman on the street near where the Szwarczynskis lived who had told the Nazis that Lucia Noviska was hiding a Jewish child. So the Nazis came and took her and she was imprisoned. And tortured. And my grandfather of course found out about that and he went to Mrs. Szwarczynski and said look, you have to do something. We have to get my wife out. And Mrs. Szwarczynski was a good friend of the wife of the commandant and so Mrs. Szwarczynski went to the commandant and said you know look, to the wife and said to her, look you know the Nazis have taken my cook and I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do because we need her. And she certainly 1s not hiding any Jewish children. And the commandant\u2019s wife talked to her husband and the next thing is that the commandant came and she was released from prison and told not to talk about it to anyone. And she was released and came back. Now what I remember I had \u2014 I was in kind of a crib. I remember a crib with a ladder to get to the crib. And I just remember a ladder that I would climb out of the crib and into. One day I heard some noise, lots and lots of noise and the dog came. And grabbed me, some kind of way. Either I was on the ladder, I don\u2019t know. But the dog grabbed my clothing or grabbed me, something, and took me to the door of the house. And I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know where this was vis a vis the bedroom. I don\u2019t remember any of this. I do remember the dog taking me. And I do remember that a bomb fell on where I had been sleeping. So cause there was lots of bombing going on at that time. And \u2014"

Grandpa wanted to marry grandma. Cause she did love him very much. And she had saved our lives and he had asked her if he could give her money and she said no. My life is with you and with Jula and all. So in order to convert the rabbi said ok but she would have to shave her head and go into the mikvah.

She will not shave her head. And the rabbi, ok, Isaac she won\u2019t shave her head, all right, all right. So grandpa became Jewish. I mean grandma.

And I remember we had Purim plays and this and that. And I remember where I\u2019d take the little dog to schul. I'd try to stay out of the way of the men who would, if they could get close enough would smack you. So you had to kind of make sure you were running fast enough and avoid the smacks, with my little team of cohorts. And then we\u2019d go outside schul and make mud pies and things like that. And in the winter grandma would wrap me in rags and everything and there was a huge hill that was like a hole and not a hill, 1t was a hole. A huge hole that was dug there and we kids would go sledding there. And to me I\u2019d walk around that, the parameters of this hole and that was where God was. And so I remember always asking for my baby sister. I wanted my baby sister. And God to me, at that https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 18 August 9, 2012 point, was like a puppeteer and there were wars and things went wrong because people were like marionettes and the strings would get tangled, so that\u2019s what I remember. I remember walking with my grandfather once and taking his hand and asking him grandpa, where are my parents? And he said oh they\u2019re they went on a trip, they\u2019re far away. I said Jaju they\u2019re never coming back, are they. And he looked at me and I saw these huge tears, fat teardrops coming from his eyes. And he was not a man who cried easily. And I knew that was not a question to ask any more and I knew they were dead. And I remember once not far from the bunk we were in, there was a huge tree and there were twin brothers. They were either late teens or early 20s. They seemed aged, very aged to me at the time, but that\u2019s how old they probably were, 18 to 21. And they were standing by the tree and lightning struck and they died. They were killed and I remember seeing that. And, and that was pretty scary. And we got a care package in lager and it was said that I was going to be leaving so everybody in lager decided that this new plastic raincoat should go to me. Now mind you I was all of seven and this was an adult raincoat but nonetheless Jula had to have it. So I was so proud, this blue plastic raincoat. And then what I heard later was that grandpa had tried to get us into Palestine, the three of us and then eventually he tried to get us into Israel because remember 1n 48 Israel was not accepting and Palestine didn\u2019t want any old, old people and orphan children. So we were living a pretty difficult existence so grandpa thought it would be best if he sent me to the States. And my Tante Siegel sponsored me and what I remember is passing a place with a huge metal fence, very high metal fence. And I remember children at one side of it, the other side clinging to that fence and looking at us. And I said Jaju promise me you\u2019|l never put me there, promise. And he promised. And then I was there and because he had made -- he had decided to send me to America. And I had to go through a series of orphanages and they were Catholic orphanages or something cause I remember nuns and that was one of them. And \u2014"

And he and grandma came and he brought me a china doll which was the first toy I'd ever had because the only toys I had known were origami soldiers made out of newspapers on horses, also made out of newspapers that grandpa and I would play. And so I had this doll and not only was she a doll, she had eyes that opened and closed. Yep. And he also brought a bag of oranges. And that was incredibly much of a huge, huge big deal. And he found one of the older girls and he asked her if she would take care of me on the way to America and she said yes. Grandpa gave the oranges, some to her and some to the nun, nuns.

And what I do remember, and some of these I\u2019ve written about was ladies coming with little American flags to give us American flags. Later I found out they were the DAR. And I remember one lady coming up to me and talking to me and giving me my flag and I had no idea what she was saying because the English I knew was taught to me by an American soldier. And I could count, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That was the extent of my English. So what I didn\u2019t understand the woman spoke louder. And she screamed in my ear and I remember thinking, why do all Americans yell. And I couldn\u2019t believe it. But then I remember the nuns getting us on a bus and I said to the nun. I was very thirsty. And she gave me an orange and that didn\u2019t slack my thirst at all. But then I remember sleeping and it seemed like forever and then arriving at a soot covered brick building in New York. And what I loved about that building was it had a marble staircase. And like Tevya, I loved running up and down those stairs because I loved the sound that marble made. And they also had sweetheart soap. Well that was the first time I had smelled soap that smelled, didn\u2019t smell like tar and it was -- I kept washing my hands. And that was glorious. And I remember coming down the stairs one day and I remember this woman at the bottom talking to the nun. And what I heard and it was in German was she can\u2019t be Isaac\u2019s granddaughter. Isaac is so handsome. And then look at that hair. I bet she has lice.

Julie Keefer: But first I\u2019m going to just back track a little bit. The nuns I remember, one of the nuns taking me to a park somewhere in New York. And in the park, I saw a little girl, probably around my age. I was seven. And I looked at her and I figured out how it was that Americans could make those strange sounds. Like three and through because they had special throats. And those throats came out and because I had never seen bubble gum before. And this girl was blowing a bubble."

And Aunt Helen had a daughter Perry, who was 12. And a husband, Dick. And they lived in half of a duplex in a very Orthodox section of Brooklyn. And the first day that I remember was Aunt Helen taking me to their bathroom and cutting my hair, because she was very sure that I had lice, so she cut my hair which made me cry because I was so proud of not having lice. It was a big thing. And then I was a student at the local elementary school where the only teacher in the school who spoke any language I did was the kindergarten teacher who spoke German."

            "answer": "A little bit, very little. And so I went to the local school and the children called me retard because I was tall for my age and here I was in kindergarten at age seven. And seven and a half. And they also called me Nazi because the language I spoke was German. And Aunt Helen was a very troubled woman and it was very hard for her to take this child who had come from a war torn country and who was a granddaughter of this absent older brother that she idealized. And I was not a pretty child at all. And so she didn\u2019t know quite what to do with me. She was a little overwhelmed. Her daughter Perry was allergic to everything and Perry and I shared a room. And I just remember being truly, truly unhappy and waiting. I couldn\u2019t wait for the weekends when I would go see Tante Siegel. Tante Siegel was my father\u2019s aunt. And she is the one who sponsored my coming to America. She lived in the Bronx in, on the third floor of a walk up. In a one bedroom apartment. This one bedroom apartment, as you walked in the door you looked directly at some French doors covered by lace curtains that were the entrance to the bedroom. And otherwise you saw a sofa, a couple of chairs and a black telephone and a glass bottle near the telephone where everyone who wanted to make a call had to put in a nickel. Then there were tzedakah boxes all over the place and they were blue with white Jewish stars on them. They were all for some cause or other in Israel. For yeshivas, for trees, for whatever. And Tante Siegel herself was about four foot ten with huge round blue eyes. High cheekbones, a Clara Bow mouth and a very, very pretty face. Blondish gray hair. Her brother, Uncle Charlie, also was short but a little taller than she. And I met him a little afterwards and he had a farm in the Adirondacks that he had apparently sold the farm. He had had five daughters. He and his wife Sophie had five daughters. Like Tevya. And no sons. So he sold the farm but kept the bungalow which was a house. And there was a man-made lake and I remember Uncle Charlie driving me in this beat up black car over these hairpin turns at what seemed like umpteen miles an hour. Well of course it wasn\u2019t. But I remember Uncle Charlie\u2019s huge hands. He had these hand with large knuckles and when I first saw Van Gogh\u2019s the Potato Eaters, I could always remember Uncle Charlie cause that\u2019s what he looked like, his hands looked like. Well back to Aunt Helen -- Tante Siegel and her apartment. There was a window. On the door was \u2014 the window was on the left and I remember I would sit at that window for hours and hours and hours and just look out and just look out. There, it was all concrete. There was some kind of a basketball court. You know concrete playground with a high fence, metal fence around it and I would watch people play. And I remember feeling very sad. But Tante Siegel was very, very https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 23 August 9, 2012 warm. And her husband Uncle Jake, was a little taller than she. Huge, beak like nose, but Uncle Jake almost never spoke. He was like a shadow. So we never knew what he was thinking or whatever. He just was there. He might as well have been invisible. But I loved those times at Tante Siegel\u2019s. Tante Siegel had two children. She had Marvin who was in the army, very good looking and I only saw his pictures. And she had Adele who was married to Sid Roman. And they were supposed to move to an apartment on the other side of the third floor but it wasn\u2019t ready. So they were staying with Tante Siegel. Had to pull out something. So to say there was no room in this apartment. So the Joint wouldn\u2019t let me live there. And, but I loved going there. And I heard from my cousin Sid, many years later he had given me a huge teddy bear which he had won at a fair and he was going to give it to their first child. But he said, you looked so sad and needy there that I thought maybe I better give it to you. So he gave it to me. And I, very imaginative child, named this teddy bear, Louka, which means doll in Polish. But oh I loved that teddy bear. And that was a happy time. And Tante Siegel would have a yummy brunch every Sunday with white fish and sable, and lox and bagels and cheeses and tomatoes and all kinds of yummy stuff, always milchig. And I would be doing dishes and I inevitably used the wrong dish towel. And we had to go find a place that had any dirt in Bronx New York. But that was a challenge. So that was Tante Siegel. I remember once Aunt Rosa who always looked unbelievably chic. She had a black chignon. I\u2019m sure she died her hair but she was very regal looking, in contrast to her sister Aunt Helen who always looked bedraggled and harried. In shapeless housedresses which were ugly. Never smiled. Anyway Aunt, Tante Rosa worked outside the home. And one day she took me out for lunch and to buy me a new skirt. And the skirt, I remember was gray but it was kind of full, had big pockets with blue trim on the pocket, the top part of the pocket. And I thought it was gorgeous. And I wore it back to Aunt Helen\u2019s and I remember her yelling in the kitchen where Aunt Helen was yelling and saying why did you take that brat? Why didn\u2019t you take Perry? She deserves it. That brat doesn\u2019t deserve anything. I don\u2019t know what Isaac and that woman were thinking of. And I decided that I wouldn\u2019t wear the skirt by Aunt Helen because all it did was get Tante Rosa in trouble. So I would only wear it at Tante Siegel\u2019s. Well, one day I remembered, I was still a bit of a ring leader and Perry was very, very shy and I remember saying to Perry, let\u2019s go visit Yeta\u2019s room, Elaine, at that time she was called Elaine\u2019s https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 24 August 9, 2012 room. So her room was in the very front of the house and it had one of those satiny bedspreads that I -- quilted satin, and all these cologne bottles on a blond mirrored dresser which I thought was so gorgeous. And they all smelled so good. So I remember that was just a whole new world. Yeta was a -- Elaine wasn\u2019t thrilled that these two younger went to her room but I think she forgave us eventually but I remember that was so pretty. I just remember Aunt Helen saying that well if you\u2019re good I'll show you a picture of your grandpa when, in his soldier uniform which I had never seen him so I was -- I tried to be so good. And I was never quite good enough. So I never did see that picture. And I guess I must have been there for eight or nine months. And it was a very, very difficult time. Probably for everyone. But I remember it being very difficult for me. And I remember the social worker from the Joint coming. The first time and I was warned that I was to tell her that I was being treated beautifully and that I was very happy. And the second time she came, I didn\u2019t care and I told her I hate it here. And that I was fed with -- like a dog. Food was left in front of the bedroom. That I was a pretty awful person and ugh. Um. The social worker said Julie, we\u2019re going to send you to the country. You\u2019re going to go where you'll see chickens and cows and other children. And I thought wow, that\u2019s pretty great. I didn\u2019t want to leave Tante Siegel cause I adored her. So that was pretty sad, leaving her. But I -- someone put me in a pretty new pink dress. And I remember it had belts that tied in the back, with some flowers on it. I was eight years old and I was put on an airplane. And told that someone in Bellefaire would meet me at the other end. In Cleveland. And so I was being sent to Bellefaire Jewish children\u2019s home for problem children. And it was in Shaker Heights, Ohio. (laughs) No chickens, no cows, children yes. (laughs) But there were cottages which were brick buildings and we were assigned in cottages by gender. And by age. And I was put in the little kids\u2019 cottage when I first came which was run by Aviva and Chaim Orlen who were an Israeli couple and they were, they were very nice. I remember \u2014 what I remember is at night getting this horrible medicine, codfish liver oil and other stuff. That was sweet. And then we\u2019d get one of those Mallomar cookies with milk. Well that was so delicious. I also remember a little girl there named Tanya. Although she was older than I, she was almost a head shorter. And I remember that my teddy bear had no eyes. The eyes had been removed. I don\u2019t know what ever happened to the china doll. I don\u2019t remember but I remember that my teddy bear who I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 25 August 9, 2012 loved had lost his eyes. And I suspected that it was Tanya. I remember this so clearly. I said Tanya if you tell me the truth, I won\u2019t hit you. So she told me the truth. Yeah, she did it. And I thought that, was that stupid of me or not. Why did I say I wouldn\u2019t hit her. I was mad. But at least she told the truth. (sigh)"

And I remember I was put in the big girls\u2019 cottage. I think I was ten. When my grandparents came I was close to 11. And I have some pictures there. And I remember I didn\u2019t remember my Polish. Just English. Grandpa\u2019s shoes squeaked when he walked. And I remember grandpa and grandma and I going to the Fairmont theater, walking.

I met them first, Fritz Mayer didn\u2019t believe in our being institutionalized so we had big sisters, big brothers to take us out. And I met the Klejstadts with three other girls. They took us out for a picnic and I remember thinking how beautiful Tea was and sweet and how special I felt around her. Fred I thought was nice but I, she was warmth itself. And I had a very dear friend in Bellefaire whose name was Joyce. And we were assigned permanent big sisters, big brothers. And I was assigned to Nussensens who were lovely warm large Jewish family with two sons. The younger son had some mental health issues and I adored them both. They were like little brothers and they were just special. And Flo and Manny Nussensen were warm as warm could be. And I was just included in everything which was neat cause I was kind of a shy, dream, dreamy child who, who read all the time. And I drew a lot and painted. At Bellefaire I had an art teacher who had no thumbs and he was a phenomenal man. And I learned a great deal from him. He\u2019s black and one of my favorite counselors was black. And I mention that because we were going to Parma tubing which 1s a special lake with all kinds of stuff in Cleveland. We were on a big bus with this counselor and Fritz Mayer and we got to Parma tubing and someone came up and said oh no, we don\u2019t allow Negroes here. And so I remember Fritz Mayer puffing himself out. Zis will not go on. Come, children, get in the bus. So if you don\u2019t\u2019 take one of us, you take none of us. So we all left. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 28 August 9, 2012 But this counselor was wonderful because one, we used to give plays for July fourth. And she had Paul Robeson, Ballad for the Americans. And so I went to her house to hear it. And I was usually the star or whatever so she wanted me to listen to it. And I remember that was special. And then we had a cottage parents who were Mormon and he was getting his degree, advanced degree in chemistry. So he used to make our shampoos. They were smelly, ugh. But I suppose they were good. And his wife was just a sweetie pie. They used to play folk music and a lot of Leadbelly. So I grew up on Leadbelly."

And I had a math teacher. This was sixth grade. Oh, fourth grade was my first experience at Andrew Jackson Rikoff. Well first I went to a very elegant school, elementary school, third grade near Bellefaire. And the teacher thought I was retarded because I wrote things backwards. And she wanted us to have fresh handkerchiefs pinned on us. And at Bellefaire we had these sewing ladies who would redo clothes so they would fit us and stuff. So I went up and I asked for a hankie and they gave me a box of Kleenex. They said this is much more sanitary. So I came in with my box of Kleenex and teacher was sure I was definitely retarded so Bellefaire decided to test me. So I remember having a battery of tests. They decided no, I wasn\u2019t retarded. And but they also decided I was artistic. That Julie needed piano lessons. Well we had one piano and it was in the playroom and I was in the big girls\u2019 cottage now. Well Julie, Julie had to practice. Julia. No one was allowed in the playroom when Julia had to practice. Makes you instantly popular doesn\u2019t it? I decided I don\u2019t\u2019 want piano lessons so my piano teacher and I started talking about African violets and she taught me to knit instead which was great.

Didn\u2019t want to be adopted. Took me a long time to figure out who I was and didn\u2019t want to change it. Um, so I saw Ms. Barnes again to decide whether I would be adopted or not. And she helped. And my grandfather was very against it. At this time they were in the States and I was to go see them every summer. I couldn\u2019t live with them because they lived in some pretty awful slums and the Joint didn\u2019t think that that was safe. Then when I went to my parents, it was my mother was an artist. And I guess, I loved art and it was like wow, and my father loved having a daughter. And it was amazing to me because he was very, very educated, well-educated man who did not take to fools lightly. He had a PhD. And yet I could you know if I were taking French, we\u2019d speak French at the table so that Julie could practice. So he was very special. And they both were. And we became very, very close. And my grandfather eventually met my parents. Although he didn\u2019t understand adoption. He thought it was a form of white slavery. So I had him come and meet them. And he fell in love with my mother. He thought she was like his daughter and my father was a good business man and that he was very thrilled about. So I was adopted. I skipped a year of high school because frankly I didn\u2019t want to take math. I was terrible in math and at that time, they gave you tests in English and history and if you did well, you were put in top track. And top track meant that you had to have physics and you had to have advanced, advanced math. So I wanted to skip a year and skip that. So I did. And I graduated and my father, I said I\u2019m not going to college. And my father said um, well it\u2019s not a question of going or not going. It\u2019s a question of which college. So I said well I want to go to Sarah Lawrence and my mother said well because I had met a girl who looked like a https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 30 August 9, 2012 Rembrandt painting and with her red hair and everything and she went to Sarah Lawrence so I wanted to go there. My mother said honey, you know you might want to go someplace that\u2019s coed where you\u2019d be with both boys and girls. So I also wanted to go to the University of Chicago. So my father took me down and did not like Hyde Park at all, at all, at all and said mm, mm. You\u2019re too young to be in this. Meanwhile I had got early admittance to Antioch and I went to see Antioch. I just turned 16. But I couldn\u2019t handle that much freedom. So I said I can\u2019t handle that much freedom. My father said well I have this idea. There\u2019s a school that\u2019s close to us and I would like you to check it out for your cousin Suzanne because not only 1s it a good liberal arts school but it has a good conservatory for your cousin. So I\u2019d like a young person\u2019s opinion. I said ok, Pll go with you. Went with him. Next thing I know, I\u2019ve got an appointment with Dean Jackson, dean of admissions and Dean Jackson said you know introduces himself. And my father is sitting there and I said actually Dean Jackson you don\u2019t want to take me because I did ok on the English part but on the math part. He said yeah I see. Did you just write your name and then turn it in. I said \u2014 he said yeah, hm. He said well you know you didn\u2019t have your three years of high school math to get in so you\u2019d have to have your third year of math to get out. But yeah they decided they would take me. So my father \u2014 I said take me. We\u2019re looking at this for my cousin and Julie you know we just adopted you and you\u2019ve been with us so little and Oberlin is only an hour away and we\u2019d like to be close to you. And I said ok. And I went to classes and I felt so comfortable because I had gone to Miami, University of Miami, Miami University in Ohio and I hated it. People were nice enough but I was doing a crossword puzzle and suddenly I was an egghead. And unh, unh, I\u2019d had enough of that. At high school. I just wanted a chance just to be me. And at Oberlin I could be me. And I loved that and I just, so that\u2019s why I went to Oberlin and kept changing majors. And then junior year when you had to declare your major, I had most hours in French and art. And studio art was a very long major and so I decided I would go for French. And I had met Larry when he was a senior and I was a junior living at French house. And he went to the University of New Hampshire for graduate school in chemistry. And he asked me to marry him which is also a funny story. I called my father to tell him that I was engaged. This is my senior year. I was, Daddy, \u2019'm engaged. You\u2019re what? I\u2019m engaged Daddy. Quiet, the silence. He didn\u2019t ask me. Daddy he https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 31 August 9, 2012 doesn\u2019t want to marry you. That fell really like a bomb. And then Larry wasn\u2019t Jewish. And my parents were upset about this. Everybody was upset about it. And but Larry was an amazing, amazing, iS an amazing man."

We stayed in Chicago for three and a half years and then, well three years. Then moved to Omaha, Nebraska and that\u2019s where our daughter was born and she had a naming ceremony and Larry decided that he also wanted to convert at that. He had taken the course in Chicago from Rabbi Devine who had them read God, Jews and History by Max Dimont. And Larry thought, great this is my thing. So he decided to convert and when he was asked ok so you'll be Abraham. He said no, I don\u2019t want to be Abraham, I want to Moshe. So they said ok be Moshe, so that\u2019s why you see the various Moses\u2019s over there. And so that\u2019s, we lived in Nebraska where Larry worked at the University of -- at a research place for cancer research. That was a part of the University of Nebraska Medical School. Then we came down here where -- oh and I got a few more degrees in Omaha. I had substitute taught in Chicago where if you could breathe and walk, they told you, you could teach. And then I realized that I needed much more training to deal with kids with problems which I enjoyed. And so when we got here I was going to go on in that field, and that\u2019s what I did."

Great, great, I guess hunh. And so I put some pressure on Steve to have the bar mitzvah and he had a hard time with that one. And I had grandpa\u2019s diary translated. And I think it was a lot for him to deal with being the son of a survivor cause it kind of fell on him. And I think the family hero was grandpa who started a resistance and all of that. Steve eventually joined the rangers, the airborne rangers and I think that\u2019s partially why. So I think yes, to some extent, but mm.

            "answer": "I, you know, the first ttme I went to Ger \u2014 no it was actually the second time I went to Germany, I had great difficulty. I had come from France and I was to meet Larry in Germany. We were going to go to Freiburg because he had a doctor herr Drochi, who had invented a special kind of rat for cancer research. And so I was to meet Larry there so we could have a vacation also. I had come from France. And I had a glorious time and I was sitting there 1n this car with these French young men who were going to Germany to work. Cause Germany paid much better wages. And just as we passed the border, the German police came on very, very officious and I got my dander up a bit and I had a big suitcase. And I didn\u2019t understand a word they were saying and I could care less. And the soldiers, the French soldiers said you know don\u2019t make a big issue of this. It\u2019s ok. We\u2019re here for you. We understand. They understood nothing but they were lovely. And so they were gentling me along. And they got the suitcase down. They said there\u2019s nothing there. She\u2019s an American, whatever, whatever. But that was my first taste. And then I got to the railroad station. And I was supposed to meet Larry there. He wasn\u2019t there. And I, there am I with this huge suitcase, no Larry. A man comes up to me cause apparently that\u2019s where you pick up prostitutes at the train station. And I didn\u2019t know. So (phone ringing) I \u2014 then Larry came and I was furious with Larry. And he had gotten the wrong time that the train was to come in and I was so angry with him. Then we had an interesting -- we stayed at the, I called it the rat house. We stayed there and for a night and then herr doctor Drochi invited us to his apartment. So Larry and I went there and I saw this man who was a caricature. A dueling scar. I think he was wearing a monocle even, I think so. And he kissed my hand and like that was his feat. And I looked at Larry and he said oh you know how nice to meet Larry. He spoke German and French, no English. Nice to meet Larry and his French wife. And I said Je ne suis pas Francaise. Je suis Americaine et je suis juife [ph]. Just like that cause I thought I am going to clear the air with this jerk. And we\u2019re sitting down and he\u2019s giving me the party line. We\u2019re talking the problems with America. They\u2019re all due to miscegenation. All in French. And I\u2019m thinking I can\u2019t believe that this guy is still around. He\u2019s a Nazi so and so. And Larry said no, no, no, no. he wouldn\u2019t have this position, Julie. He can\u2019t be a Nazi, no way and when we came back and we were having lunch with Umberto Safiati who was the NIH who is a sweetheart. And Umberto said so how was https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Julie Keefer 35 August 9, 2012 lunch with the Nazi? And Larry said what? He said oh yeah, yeah Drochi was a Nazi. Didn\u2019t you know that Larry? And I said hm. But Larry is so naive. He\u2019s so naive. Yeah, so."
