            "answer": "[Slovodka]. The name of the house was [Belionus] and [Dejeu]. [Dejeu] would bear the big [Yeshiva], 1f you know what a [Yeshiva] is. And that was about --even at the _, the [Yeshiva] was there. And we used to go, you know, shoot this or something, if you know about the other days. looked like the [Yeshiva] boys used to dance and sing and so on. And then, my mother, may she rest in peace, she used to give the boys each a bath twice a week. And they [could eat]. So it means breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ANd that\u2019s what my mother used to give. Sometimes, if the help was a [serbet]. So at meals, we were good of the help and some people. I didn\u2019t say that we were millionaires. But they were rich, you know. If they were happy, about the \u2014_. _I remember when the one thing that my papa start building the second floor, I used to go early in the morning -- and we didn\u2019t have the water, like here, but they have a little place they used to carry out the buckets and get the water from about a block away and bring home. But no matter what, they were , no matter what, they were before. Sometimes was maybe hard days, too. But it was a sweet life. Everybody determined. It was everybody together. No fights, no rise, no nothing. And then, I had a grandmother, too, with us. That life will never come back. It\u2019s nght, the time is mine, too, but I never can forget. It\u2019s hard to describe, even in that language that I know so good, it\u2019s hard -- but I think it\u2019s hard to bring out -- retelling the fear [of the more], the fear for the same thing. It is -- I just couldn\u2019t describe, but I describe to you one thing about Friday night -- but it was for the Jewish people -- it\u2019s [Labutte]. Because it\u2019s Labutte -- everybody got a little house for their self. And Friday night, no matter, you reach a middle place [poor people], that Holy [Bible] gave the people life to lead a whole week. Even the people who came to [ask], you know, help. You had plenty poor people, but when it came Friday night, the candles was light up in the windows. The cakes they were cooking were smelling This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

That they should have for supper, [Hallit], because that was the main thing, you know. The life of -- the Jewish life, a little -- no matter how many books you can write, it\u2019s hard to describe how beautiful and how lovely it was. It\u2019s so many things to describe about the life in Lithuania -- the holiness, the [Chabas]. My daddy used to go to \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, come back from . Everything was prepared. It is unbelievable to describe to you the happiness that you used to see daddies coming in. The table was set, the was made, and everybody was sitting around the table and eating and enjoy it, the [Chabas]. The [CHabas] gave you so much for the whole week. To grow on. And you were brimming again about another Chabas. So that life, no matter what it is, and again, you [have to describe it], you don\u2019t have, we don\u2019t see. And we will never see it again. Never again. It\u2019s just for my eye I could see . . . candles\u2019 lights, this mirror, the way they were singing, the windows in the summertime was open. It is a life -- I don\u2019t know. I even, I think you need it. I cannot describe the beauty, what it means Friday night at [Chabas]. Everybody used to go, dressed up, [Chabas after], you know, the \u2014_, and they could walk and talking and ~\u2014_\u2014___ each other, and dressed up with the best clothes what they have. But with [Chabas], you used to have -- and it\u2019s quite another feeling. It\u2019s hard, but it was the beauty. The [ Yeshivas], the schools -- you had schools, and everything was gone. Nothing was left over."

For instance, if a girl, a poor girl, had a boy, after awhile forgot about it. And the girl didn\u2019t have no home, no nothing, and she find a boy and I want to marry them off (ph), see now, what I did, I took another lady with me and I went, took my friends and I told them about the cake (ph), and I said, \u201cI need help.

And then, I -- then what had happened, I couldn\u2019t do anything in life, like culture or so on, because like I said, my husband was -- he finished law and then he started up with the motorcycles, and we have to make a living, too. So I was occupied with the children -- I had another child, too. [Pause] So, I was in the business with my husband. And it was really a life beautiful. Then when the war broke out, I lost a little dear (ph). I had a little dear (ph) and I lost him. Well, honey, it\u2019s a whole lot just to think that, it\u2019s a whole lot to talk.

A whole lot worse because, you see, the Jewish people -- most of the Prolat (ph) people used to go, \u201cOh, oh.\u201d The Russians, they go, \u201cBring us -- I don\u2019t know -- the breath from the sky.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t like that, 1t wasn\u2019t. I'll give you an example. I have an uncle. He had a farm, a big farm. And he was , and among them was a whole lot farmers, farmers. He always used to help them. When they need because they\u2019re in trouble, or they just need a horse, or they need -- they used to have a cow, because the little farmers, they was very poor there. And he used to help them because he was very big, had a very big farm. And the farmers knew my mother very well. Of course, she was raised in that farm, and then when she got married, you know, she came to Slovodka (ph). And when the farmer\u2019s people, somebody used to get sick, they used to come to us, and the mother used to help them, to take them to the hospital.

And that was before the war started up. So the rich people, some of them, they were lucky. They went to America, they went to another place. But here, I could see everything the way it was. The middle-class, didn\u2019t bother, but who was in charge in a place like factory people, or you know, the other people, you know, what they had stores, bakeries and so on -- the people went on the first list. And they took him away and they send him to Siberia. I still couldn\u2019t remember what had happened to the Lithuanian people. I still couldn\u2019t think how people could change -- murders, chilling. When the war broke out, like I told you, the got here and the jail got here. And what had happened within that time, my husband, he took me and my son and my little girl, and we were running. Everybody start running to the RUssians, . We run and they couldn\u2019t reach, they couldn\u2019t see, because the German came here already (ph). So what we have to do? No food, no nothing. We turn back home. They come in home. Some Lithuanian people told us, \u201cDon\u2019t go this way, go this way.\u201d It\u2019s terrible. They took the Jewish people to the Ninth Fort (ph). They never came back. The children, parents, all the people. , they took the children. They killed them all up there. Fortunately, we were lucky. We took the left , not the right, and became a home. And when I saw my father -- he was dark complexion -- he was light, like that. In one night, they killed 200 people, over 200 people. It was , then Gatvia (ph). And we came back and they told us what had happened. They then took the neighbors. The blood on the walls -- some people wrote in Yiddish, \u201cPlease, name Nicole\u201d -- I don\u2019t know how to say it in English. He wrote with the blood of the singer (ph), with big letters. A little boy from the family, what they knew, he was under the bed. They didn\u2019t see him. He had seen what goes on. So that little boy became a life that had to lay there. I just don\u2019t know.

So fortunately, they didn\u2019t murder them. They thought nobody\u2019s home. Well, I want to think. Well, then it happened, and the Germans came in. And they took over, you know. Slovodkians (ph), they took, you know Kovno, all Lithuanian. They put us in the ghetto. Our house was on was on -- from the corner from our house, up to the end. I _____ made the ghetto, already, that was in August the 15th, I think. Was locked up. You couldn\u2019t take anything with you. They had to leave everything that you had, except, you know, the clothes and something else. And we moved into my parents, in their house. And then my husband\u2019s family, and his sister -- they all were there in the house where we were living. It wasn\u2019t enough home[s] for so many people, I don\u2019t know, 50,000 it was. So we had two ghettos. One was a little ghetto, and one was the big ghetto. We were in the big ghetto. My husband\u2019s sister, her name was Doris, she was married, had a little boy. And she was in the little ghetto. I\u2019m going -- I forgot to tell you something. And getting back the way 1 told you we find out -- you know what they did? They took the rabbis. They got in there, they cut off his head and they parade with the rabbi\u2019s head in the street. You see, when I am talking, that cannot concentrate. You see, I have to run from one to the other. That was terrible. That was murderous --Yet I never thought that the Lithuanian people would do like that. A dog, a cat, got more privacies that a Jew. Well, I'll make short this. . ."

So, what they did, they took my family. Five people in ten minutes. Right before I tear them out of my arms, they was already gone. [Crying] I couldn\u2019t do nothing. I couldn\u2019t do not a thing because the police and the German guards, and I didn\u2019t thought that that could happen to them. It was about ten or eleven o\u2019clock in the morning. Since then, I didn\u2019t see them anymore. My last -- please forgive me, I\u2019m sorry. But do you know what it means to lose your family in ten minutes? I never could forget.

            "answer": "In October of 1943. Between that time, there was a city with the name Shabut (ph), and there was a number of Jewish people. And the people of Shabut (ph), that was, at that time, from October until December. They took the children from the parents out there. And somebody came to tell us that the children from Shabut (ph) had been taken away from the parents. Children, little ones, until up to 12 years. Twelve years, they can still go on at the work \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014. - So I said to my husband, what he should do, before I find out about the farmer, that my uncle is still alive. I got in contact with the farmer, Martinez (ph), that was his name. ANd, like I told you, my uncle used to help them a whole lot. So, they want to pay back to him, to help him. He was out in 82 places doing things. Eighty-two places. The only thing that it was to get in contact 1s somebody had to contact them that we should survive if it was with Jay, or maybe to send Jay alone. I finally got in contact with that Jultus Schmitt (ph), with him that was his neighbor. And I used to send him some medicine, too. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And then I used to send for him, for the farmer, he wants a suit I used to bring him, a suit. I used to run away, like I told you. I used to make my work, my work is finished, then I used to take off my Star of David, and used to run. I used to go. There was a coal brigade. There was, not too far from the coal brigade, a neighbor. And that man used to come to that neighbor. They knew each other. So when I got in over there, I used to find him. When I found him, first I have to finish my work. Four women has to finish to shovel the coal from the -- what you call it? -- train. So they used to have -- oy, like a choo choo train. So when I finish my work, and everything already finished, they didn\u2019t bother you, as long you finished at the coal brigade (ph). Then I went with him and I got in contact with him. And I told him about the baby. And I said, \u201cPlease, immediately, try to get my uncle and tell him about the teddy (ph). And please, he should help us to get out from the ghetto.\u201d That\u2019s the way I got in contact with my uncle. And I was in the brigade. And then, I had a nice, good package. He brought me some -- like, eggs, and he got a few pieces of butter, and bread, and flour. And when I got that, it was already late. The coal brigade was already gone. And I was left over by myself. Now, what should Ido? Where shouldI _? It\u2019s no place. No place where to go and what to do. I was fortunately lucky. It was there go slow (ph), you know -- what you call it? It was a brigade, but they used to make -- go slow, allthe \u2014\u2014_, and they used to take up from the garden."

She had a package. That was wrong. That was wrong. The life in ghetto is worse than a dog in the street. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, they used . They used to call up to get dressed and get out and take them in a special place, special field. Cold, bitter cold, to test what the people gonna do. Having my little boy, before you dressed him -- here you couldn\u2019t see here in the clothes. I used to put up everything in his little bed that he used to be -- put up everything that in the morning, if it should rain, I should have right away for him, to dress him, and to be outside. How many people have there been -- in there room? No, less than that -- eight -- I think about eighteen or nineteen, maybe more. People there were sleeping on the floors. There was no beds, no sofas. But at least we had a pillow. And we had, you know, a , whatever. It\u2019s -- who can describe the horrible things in the ghettos. No ink can write, no writer can write up what we had to do during the three years. But one thing that 1t was to me, as I told you, that was my people there."

Gestapo, you know, the police, you know from over there -- the German police -- they was looking for the people. And there was, across from them, somebody left a little boy or a girl, to hide them. They killed him. It\u2019s so many things, I tell you. It happened so fast, where to start. And then, we came to his house. And by going back, to another farmer, he said, \u201cPlease, get in, all of us, in one place.\u201d Like this. ANd we looked, a big storm. And we heard not a fire from that place. The Germans was running to look around. And we were sitting there for an hour. Cold, bitter cold, just like that. That it shouldn\u2019t look like we are Jewish people. That, see, that we are hiding.

And I had the -- I knew some people who want to sell the house, and they need some money to go ina . It\u2019s a pity-case or something, you know. And I help them. But with the help, I shouldn\u2019t do it. Because if they would caught me, they would send me to Siberia anyhow. My husband knew that the George (ph). And he introduced me to him. When he introduced me to him, I became a lawyer. I start doing the papers, you know, to sell the papers. A thousand in one night. That\u2019s the way I want to tell you. And I became -- I used to sell the house. I didn\u2019t have no trouble. I had the secretary. She knew me already. I had the people who want to buy. And a happy people who wants the money to get out from Kovno to go into free world. So 1made money. The truth. I made money, I didn\u2019t have to work hard. But, each time I used to have something else to wear. I didn\u2019t wear the same clothes. [Crying] Everything that I was doing was fear. Fear and painful. We made some money. I made it.

To make a long story short, I ran, not to the door, but I open up a window and jumped out of the window -- jumped out with Jay through the window. In the back yard, was there a truck, you know? And he took us to vendors (ph). Between three and four months, it took us to get in Berlin. And from Berlin, we got in in the American zone (ph). Four months, I forgot my name. Jay said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s my name.\u201d That\u2019s another thing -- cannot go on the same name each time. Each time, wherever we went, it was no flowers. They took out my husband from the train. We didn\u2019t know about it. But they took my husband because he was wearing boots. And all of a sudden, they have seen that he got a watch. I thought it\u2019s the end. But he said, \u201cLet me go. You want my boots? Here are the boots. In another place, you\u2019ve got your watch. Let us go out.\u201d We had been in Nobody\u2019s Land for four or five days. Snow, bitter cold. Jay got sick. It 1s just unbelievable, unbelievable what people can go through -- maybe because I was younger. Well, to make a long story short, it was in Munich, and they had there, my husband had a job. Then I want to come to America to see my sister and my aunt that was my mother\u2019s sister. I wrote them a letter that I want to come to America and I need your help. Didn\u2019t took no time. And I told them I don\u2019t want to be any more on the bloody earth. And we got the papers. I didn\u2019t know what to do, which way to turn and which way to go. In Israel, you couldn\u2019t go because it\u2019s no place with no certificate. So, finally, when we came here, people were warm, people were nice. But I didn\u2019t have the language. I didn\u2019t know nothing. And my husband has to start out life from the beginning."

It 1s to describe you moments like that -- the other people thought the same way. Oy, you thought that you are dead. You are alive. I said, Yes, Iam here. It is things that you couldn\u2019t believe. You couldn\u2019t believe and you see some friends -- , that they are still come out from the ghettos, from the concentration camps. You feel like one family. That\u2019s the way you felt when you have met the people from the concentration camps. We were looking at each other and saying, \u201cIs that the truth?\u201d We are still alive. We couldn\u2019t believe our own self anymore. And then we used to get together once in a while with some people, you know, whom we knew. They used to be in the -- what you call it -- in other places, just like this. It\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s really unbelievable. Tears from happiness that the people are alive. What you used to talking to people. What you used to do in Munich. In Munich, it was only one thing. How did you survive? How did you survive in places like that -- like in the concentration camps. No food, lice, no showers, no bread. And that was the main talk, about that. You couldn\u2019t talk about something else, but each time, \u201c\u201cWhat happened to you? How did you survive? What happened to them?\u201d And everybody used to tell you the biography of the war, the concentration camps, of the life, what they had there. And I know -- we were in the ghettos. It was the same thing, but not so horribly, like in the concentration camps. So fortunately, we were in ghetto. So that was the life in Munich. "
