I could sell everything that was in the store. I used to put on clothes and show them -- I used to sell the -- I was modelling, too. I didn\u2019t have to do anything they thought might be . I didn\u2019t have to help to support the family because my papa was making money. He had, you know, a shoe store and a repair shop, from shoes. So he was making good money, and he support all the children, but he worked. It was a sweet life. And then we had a home -- two-story house.

            "question": "Was this in Kovno or [Slovodka].",
            "answer": "[Slovodka]. The name of the house was [Belionus] and [Dejeu]. [Dejeu] would bear the big [Yeshiva], 1f you know what a [Yeshiva] is. And that was about --even at the _, the [Yeshiva] was there. And we used to go, you know, shoot this or something, if you know about the other days. looked like the [Yeshiva] boys used to dance and sing and so on. And then, my mother, may she rest in peace, she used to give the boys each a bath twice a week. And they [could eat]. So it means breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ANd that\u2019s what my mother used to give. Sometimes, if the help was a [serbet]. So at meals, we were good of the help and some people. I didn\u2019t say that we were millionaires. But they were rich, you know. If they were happy, about the \u2014_. _I remember when the one thing that my papa start building the second floor, I used to go early in the morning -- and we didn\u2019t have the water, like here, but they have a little place they used to carry out the buckets and get the water from about a block away and bring home. But no matter what, they were , no matter what, they were before. Sometimes was maybe hard days, too. But it was a sweet life. Everybody determined. It was everybody together. No fights, no rise, no nothing. And then, I had a grandmother, too, with us. That life will never come back. It\u2019s nght, the time is mine, too, but I never can forget. It\u2019s hard to describe, even in that language that I know so good, it\u2019s hard -- but I think it\u2019s hard to bring out -- retelling the fear [of the more], the fear for the same thing. It is -- I just couldn\u2019t describe, but I describe to you one thing about Friday night -- but it was for the Jewish people -- it\u2019s [Labutte]. Because it\u2019s Labutte -- everybody got a little house for their self. And Friday night, no matter, you reach a middle place [poor people], that Holy [Bible] gave the people life to lead a whole week. Even the people who came to [ask], you know, help. You had plenty poor people, but when it came Friday night, the candles was light up in the windows. The cakes they were cooking were smelling all over. And no matter even -- you know, when the people didn\u2019t have -- they used to [say, \u201cbeing in the house,\u201d Hallit].. You know what the [Hallit] is? That they should have for supper, [Hallit], because that was the main thing, you know. The life of -- the Jewish life, a little -- no matter how many books you can write, it\u2019s hard to describe how beautiful and how lovely it was. It\u2019s so many things to describe about the life in Lithuania -- the holiness, the [Chabas]. My daddy used to go to \u2014\u2014_\u2014s, come back from . Everything was prepared. It is unbelievable to describe to you the happiness that you used to see daddies coming in. The table was set, the was made, and everybody was sitting around the table and eating and enjoy it, the [Chabas]. The [CHabas] gave you so much for the whole week. To grow on. And you were brimming again about another Chabas. So that life, no matter what it is, and again, you [have to describe it], you don\u2019t have, we don\u2019t see. And we will never see it again. Never again. It\u2019s just for my eye I could see . . . candles\u2019 lights, this mirror, the way they were singing, the windows in the summertime was open. It is a life -- I don\u2019t know. I even, I think you need it. I cannot describe the beauty, what it means Friday night at [Chabas]. Everybody used to go, dressed up, [Chabas after], you know, the \u2014_, and they could walk and talking and ~\u2014_\u2014___ each other, and dressed up with the best clothes what they have. But with [Chabas], you used to have -- and it\u2019s quite another feeling. It\u2019s hard, but it was the beauty. The [ Yeshivas], the schools -- you had schools, and everything was gone. Nothing was left over."

            "answer": "I used to help a whole lot, you know, some people (ph). I didn\u2019t do too much culture, but you see, I used to help a whole lot the Jewish poor people. For instance, if a girl, a poor girl, had a boy, after awhile forgot about it. And the girl didn\u2019t have no home, no nothing, and she find a boy and I want to marry them off (ph), see now, what I did, I took another lady with me and I went, took my friends and I told them about the cake (ph), and I said, \u201cI need help. That girl didn\u2019t have anything.\u201d But you have to have a dowry, you have to have that and so on. And one thing I want to tell you -- that it happened to me -- two young girls. And that\u2019s what I helped them to get married. And they got married and they were leading a sweet life until, you know, the war came. I used to help a whole lot people who need some money, you know, to borrow the money to help to get, to buy Singer\u2019s (ph) machine. They didn\u2019t have -- they have to have special. I used to help them. I used to give them. And then they used to pay me back. So each time, then, if they need some money, I was on the book. I used to help them with that. And then, I -- then what had happened, I couldn\u2019t do anything in life, like culture or so on, because like I said, my husband was -- he finished law and then he started up with the motorcycles, and we have to make a living, too. So I was occupied with the children -- I had another child, too. [Pause] So, I was in the business with my husband. And it was really a life beautiful. Then when the war broke out, I lost a little dear (ph). I had a little dear (ph) and I lost him. Well, honey, it\u2019s a whole lot just to think that, it\u2019s a whole lot to talk. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m jumping from one thing to the other, and I\u2019m not going exactly the way it should be. I don\u2019t know."

            "answer": "You see, the problem, what it was in Lithuania, that the Russians came in. And when the Russians came in, you see, then it started up a whole lot worse. A whole lot worse because, you see, the Jewish people -- most of the Prolat (ph) people used to go, \u201cOh, oh.\u201d The Russians, they go, \u201cBring us -- I don\u2019t know -- the breath from the sky.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t like that, 1t wasn\u2019t. I'll give you an example. I have an uncle. He had a farm, a big farm. And he was , and among them was a whole lot farmers, farmers. He always used to help them. When they need because they\u2019re in trouble, or they just need a horse, or they need -- they used to have a cow, because the little farmers, they was very poor there. And he used to help them because he was very big, had a very big farm. And the farmers knew my mother very well. Of course, she was raised in that farm, and then when she got married, you know, she came to Slovodka (ph). And when the farmer\u2019s people, somebody used to get sick, they used to come to us, and the mother used to help them, to take them to the hospital. She used to cook for them, you know, some food, and take over there. So, with the farmers, was very, very good. And, as I remember, and then later on, I will come, maybe to that point, the way we survived."

            "question": "We'll get to that. Now, was there much of a change of lifestyle when the Russians came 1n?",
            "answer": "Yeah, it changed a whole lot. It changed a whole lot. I tell you something -- my husband can tell you more than I can tell you -- it changed everything, the whole life. It took the rich people who had, you know, stores and they took him and send him to Siberia. And that was before the war started up. So the rich people, some of them, they were lucky. They went to America, they went to another place. But here, I could see everything the way it was. The middle-class, didn\u2019t bother, but who was in charge in a place like factory people, or you know, the other people, you know, what they had stores, bakeries and so on -- the people went on the first list. And they took him away and they send him to Siberia. I still couldn\u2019t remember what had happened to the Lithuanian people. I still couldn\u2019t think how people could change -- murders, chilling. When the war broke out, like I told you, the got here and the jail got here. And what had happened within that time, my husband, he took me and my son and my little girl, and we were running. Everybody start running to the RUssians, . We run and they couldn\u2019t reach, they couldn\u2019t see, because the German came here already (ph). So what we have to do? No food, no nothing. We turn back home. They come in home. Some Lithuanian people told us, \u201cDon\u2019t go this way, go this way.\u201d It\u2019s terrible. They took the Jewish people to the Ninth Fort (ph). They never came back. The children, parents, all the people. , they took the children. They killed them all up there. Fortunately, we were lucky. We took the left , not the right, and became a home. And when I saw my father -- he was dark complexion -- he was light, like that. In one night, they killed 200 people, over 200 people. It was , then Gatvia (ph). And we came back and they told us what had happened. They then took the neighbors. The blood on the walls -- some people wrote in Yiddish, \u201cPlease, name Nicole\u201d -- I don\u2019t know how to say it in English. He wrote with the blood of the singer (ph), with big letters. A little boy from the family, what they knew, he was under the bed. They didn\u2019t see him. He had seen what goes on. So that little boy became a life that had to lay there. I just don\u2019t know. It is so many things. So many things. It\u2019s unbelievable. You wouldn\u2019t believe it, and nobody could believe that people could be such murderers. But murderers -- I judge the same people, the same people who we knew, they used to come to my house and___.._ They asked to help -- the same Lithuanian people, they slaughtered them. But from one __, from one all the way to the end, they didn\u2019t let . My papa was lucky. He locked windows, you know? And they got up on the , and it was very quiet. So fortunately, they didn\u2019t murder them. They thought nobody\u2019s home. Well, I want to think. Well, then it happened, and the Germans came in. And they took over, you know. Slovodkians (ph), they took, you know Kovno, all Lithuanian. They put us in the ghetto. Our house was on was on -- from the corner from our house, up to the end. I _____ made the ghetto, already, that was in August the 15th, I think. Was locked up. You couldn\u2019t take anything with you. They had to leave everything that you had, except, you know, the clothes and something else. And we moved into my parents, in their house. And then my husband\u2019s family, and his sister -- they all were there in the house where we were living. It wasn\u2019t enough home[s] for so many people, I don\u2019t know, 50,000 it was. So we had two ghettos. One was a little ghetto, and one was the big ghetto. We were in the big ghetto. My husband\u2019s sister, her name was Doris, she was married, had a little boy. And she was in the little ghetto. I\u2019m going -- I forgot to tell you something. And getting back the way 1 told you we find out -- you know what they did? They took the rabbis. They got in there, they cut off his head and they parade with the rabbi\u2019s head in the street. You see, when I am talking, that cannot concentrate. You see, I have to run from one to the other. That was terrible. That was murderous --Yet I never thought that the Lithuanian people would do like that. A dog, a cat, got more privacies that a Jew. Well, I'll make short this. . ."

And I prepared him -- I knew already that we have to go, you know, in the ghetto -- that he should help me to bring some potatoes, flours, maybe, you know, oil, or something else. And that left us for a couple of months to go on with the food. It wasn\u2019t easy because we didn\u2019t have anything to eat. We couldn\u2019t go out. In , you had to go to work, but even if you go to work, you cannot bring in anything. So I have to hide. [ll tell you, when I went to work, I had to slice his bread like that, on my half a loaf. And I was looking which is the best one to go in in the ghetto. So, I start looking around here and here. And then he came here to me, the police did, you know? The German guard. \u201cWhat I have here?\u201d I said, \u201cNothing. Perhaps it got here in your pocket. Oh\u201d I said, \u201cI got to just slice this bread. You know, you wouldn\u2019t believe it, but please believe me.\u201d He took away from me the bread because I have to help out (ph) Jay. He beat me up like an apple, an apple (ph). He beat me up, here in the back that for three weeks, I couldn\u2019t sleep on my back. And the next day, I have to go to work. It wasn\u2019t an easy life, but still, I was happy. And I had my family all together. No matter what he had, even then, they used to tell us, some days it\u2019s a good day. You can take being in the ghetto. You know? They used to bring in the food, and then all of a sudden, they used to take away from you. And here, it\u2019s no food, hunger. Then I used to go work. I used to take some -- I tell you -- I used to go to work, I always, my feeling, Ill go find my little boy. By being in ghetto, they burned down the hospital, with the children, with the doctors, with the nurse, across from the place where we used to live, and there\u2019s a site.

You have to do it. That wasn\u2019t . It was, I think, more people. You used to have good brigades, and you used to have bad ones. A good brigade means that you would go out and you would shop, you know, to get a package. The bad ones used to be, like, big, old. And one day, I went to work. And we were standing, we were shoveling, you know, sand and mud. They were building a bridge. And we were standing and we were talking. said, \u201cOh, I wish I would have a before .\u2019 T said, \u201cWell, I wish we could have Chabas (ph) to feast.\u201d\u201d You know, we were talking. We didn\u2019t talk about anything else. But just to have something that we used to have before the war. And by talking like that, the German guard got in, and I was standing with the shovel and I didn\u2019t work because we were talking. He hit me with his rifle over my head. I don\u2019t know how many stitches I had. I came bleeded up. And then I went, and they took me right away back to the ghetto. ANd I came to the and the doctor gave me -- they put in some stitches -- they got out the hair and put me some stitches and bandaged up my head and the next day I had to go to work. I have to work every single day. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, and then come back 5:00. Back home. My heart, about my little boy, because we used to say, \u201cThey get in and they get us and take away the children.\u201d So, you know, I\u2019m awful sad. I bet it was. But now, I have something to tell you. They got in in the ghetto -- that was August, I think, the 15th or the 20th, I couldn\u2019t remember. In September, we had Rosh Hosanna. A day before that, they took out 20 -- 2,000 people to go to the , you know. And there was my father, my husband and my older brother. And between 4:30 and 5:00 -- do you know what it means? -- \u201cGod\u2019s all over the ghetto.\u201d They got in and they said, \u201cGet out.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere?\u201d He said, \u201cDo you see all the people here? Go with the people together. Save us little.\u201d It was a nice -- it wasn\u2019t too cold, but you know, in Europe, the weather is a little different. And I said, \u201cWait a moment. Let me take for my boy his clothes, his little coat.\u201d He said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need. He will have there enough.\u201d I had a feeling something is wrong. And I had my grandmother and my mother, my sister, Jay, myself, and we have to go for . And __ was gone way, way -- hardly could see my --- and I knew, it is a selection. Because it was about 5,000 people in that area where we were -- was over 5,000 people. I was working. I couldn\u2019t say anything that they said only one thing. \u201c \u00bb God, please, we are poor. Let them help us (ph).\u201d Then they came, big field for us (ph). And everybody has to go forth, in aline. And we get there, to that place -- our neighbors, I see the doctor, the nurse, there. . [knew them. They was ahead of me. ANd I\u2019d seen that if somebody said, \u201cHe\u2019s a doctor, he\u2019s a nurse, he\u2019s a bookkeeper, he\u2019s from the higher educated people,\u201d left. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d It\u2019s come by-and-by, asked my name, what I got here. So, I told him about . \u201cMy husband, my father and my brother went to the airport. They are automechanics.\u201d And I said, \u201cWe left over.\u201d And he said, . So I told him, \u201cI am a dressmaker.\u201d But I was young, I was strong, I wasn\u2019t in tear. He said, . So, to the right side. To the right side, I knew that we are alive. The next morning, my father, shall he rest in peace, and my husband and my brother said that they already knew of the airport, but it was going good. ANd he said, \u201cIF they are not here,\u201d he said my life is not anymore. That moment -- it \u2018s hard to describe, it\u2019s hard to describe -- There you see all the 50 people they took, I think, out of our 2,000, and killed them, all of them. At random, like dogs (ph). That was 1941."

And the people of Shabut (ph), that was, at that time, from October until December. They took the children from the parents out there. And somebody came to tell us that the children from Shabut (ph) had been taken away from the parents. Children, little ones, until up to 12 years. Twelve years, they can still go on at the work \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014. - So I said to my husband, what he should do, before I find out about the farmer, that my uncle is still alive.

I finally got in contact with that Jultus Schmitt (ph), with him that was his neighbor. And I used to send him some medicine, too. And then I used to send for him, for the farmer, he wants a suit I used to bring him, a suit. I used to run away, like I told you. I used to make my work, my work is finished, then I used to take off my Star of David, and used to run. I used to go. There was a coal brigade. There was, not too far from the coal brigade, a neighbor. And that man used to come to that neighbor. They knew each other. So when I got in over there, I used to find him. When I found him, first I have to finish my work. Four women has to finish to shovel the coal from the -- what you call it? -- train. So they used to have -- oy, like a choo choo train. So when I finish my work, and everything already finished, they didn\u2019t bother you, as long you finished at the coal brigade (ph). Then I went with him and I got in contact with him. And I told him about the baby. And I said, \u201cPlease, immediately, try to get my uncle and tell him about the teddy (ph). And please, he should help us to get out from the ghetto.\u201d That\u2019s the way I got in contact with my uncle. And I was in the brigade. And then, I had a nice, good package. He brought me some -- like, eggs, and he got a few pieces of butter, and bread, and flour. And when I got that, it was already late. The coal brigade was already gone. And I was left over by myself. Now, what should Ido? Where shouldI _? It\u2019s no place. No place where to go and what to do. I was fortunately lucky. It was there go slow (ph), you know -- what you call it? It was a brigade, but they used to make -- go slow, allthe \u2014\u2014_, and they used to take up from the garden."

It happened there at the coal brigade, was easy to make a Pekel (ph), they way they said, you know, a package. So it was a good day. Everybody from the women that finished. And some people used to know already that some people got clothes or something, you know. They made some packages -- good for us (ph).And all of a sudden, the guard from Gestapo came in to see what\u2019s going on by the coal brigade. Had seen their packages. And he asked, \u201cWhose package is this one?\u201d One girl got up and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d She said, \u201cTake the package.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014.

She had a package. That was wrong. That was wrong. The life in ghetto is worse than a dog in the street. Four o\u2019clock in the morning, they used . They used to call up to get dressed and get out and take them in a special place, special field. Cold, bitter cold, to test what the people gonna do. Having my little boy, before you dressed him -- here you couldn\u2019t see here in the clothes. I used to put up everything in his little bed that he used to be -- put up everything that in the morning, if it should rain, I should have right away for him, to dress him, and to be outside. How many people have there been -- in there room? No, less than that -- eight -- I think about eighteen or nineteen, maybe more. People there were sleeping on the floors. There was no beds, no sofas. But at least we had a pillow. And we had, you know, a , whatever. It\u2019s -- who can describe the horrible things in the ghettos. No ink can write, no writer can write up what we had to do during the three years. But one thing that 1t was to me, as I told you, that was my people there."

Used to take our peoples, they used to kill the people, they used to hang the people. Honey, I cannot tell you, just in the three hours, what they did. Before they went to the airport, they took 2,000 people -- and it was Rosh Hosanna -- and some people didn\u2019t want to go because it was the holidays. And what do you think they did? They killed them. They killed them to show them that you must go to work, it\u2019s no holidays.

Don\u2019t look for some other places where to leave him.\u201d So then he give me a push to go see my uncle again. And when they came already to that point, the way they were talking and everything was set up, we cut the wires -- -- and Jay walked out first. And he went across the street there, and we told Jay, \u201cHere and here,\u201d and it was gone. Here and here in that place. We\u2019ll be there in another half hour, maybe. Please don\u2019t call, don\u2019t scream, don\u2019t say anything. Jay was waiting there for us -- there was another man who will pick us up. It took us about a half hour to go out on the wires. And you have to watch the guard. When the guard was away, and everything was quiet, we got through the wires, and we came to where Jay was. And that man,his name was Martinez (ph). And he took us there where my uncle was. What I did, I took Martinez (ph) a jacket. You know, he scout (ph). Igaveitto \u2014\u2014_, to my husband, and his I gave to Martinez (ph) because he is a Prussian (ph). And if he didn\u2019t look like a Jewish person, and when we were driving, we took Jay in that wagon. On top of that, we put up straw that you shouldn\u2019t see that the child is there. And I had -- from a Christian, I had somebody years ago, a little jacket, you know, a little coat, and put on a scarf, and both of us looked like Prussian (ph) people, like farmers. And sure enough, we drove up. It was about 30 miles from Kovno. And they stopped us. My heart was beating. And I said, that is the end. And what had happened, he said, \u201cHave you got eggs for sale? Have you got something else for sale?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d That man, Martinez (ph), himself, he said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have anything for sale.\u201d \u201cOh, well, good-bye.\u201d But that was a lucky moment. Finally, where should we go? So that farmer was very nice and he took us in to his house -- raining, cold, you know. We came in. He didn\u2019t took us right away to his house, but he took us to his brother-in-law\u2019s house. And Jay was there under the straw, and all of a sudden, he starts saying, \u201cMama, Daddy -- Mama, Daddy.\u201d And the farmer, his brother-in-law said, \u201cWhat do I hear? I hear a voice.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cGo away. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Lucky number again. And we brought there, then we came to his house. We came to his house and was there for 39 days. The time was up. We find out that some people -- a lawyer from a ghetto -- it means my uncle\u2019s nephew is here hiding. He told us we have to go and not delay because we are in trouble. Gestapo, you know, the police, you know from over there -- the German police -- they was looking for the people. And there was, across from them, somebody left a little boy or a girl, to hide them. They killed him. It\u2019s so many things, I tell you. It happened so fast, where to start. And then, we came to his house. And by going back, to another farmer, he said, \u201cPlease, get in, all of us, in one place.\u201d Like this. ANd we looked, a big storm.

Not one of you will be left alive.\u201d Because it was not allowed to keep Jewish people. So he was in 82 places. Each time in another place, each time. The way people running from one place to the other. So, when it happened, that case. And he let us stay until -- I think six days or seven. And he starts looking around, why the dogs was barking. Why the dogs was barking. Something was wrong in their house. He said, \u201cI cannot keep you anymore.\u201d I said, \u201cPut us in the potatoes bin,\u201d you know, where the yeast is.

They didn\u2019t have a cow. They got only one pig, or two, and two sheeps. When we came there, my uncle came. And he said, \u201cHere is that place. Try to be as long as you can.\u201d And the farmers, already, was afraid, that in case somebody will give him out. So all the farmers will get killed. So they were watching already. You see, they was watching -- they was watching him that nobody should give him out, in case or now they\u2019re all in trouble. He came over there. And my uncle used to come there. But we have to have a hiding place. Because we heard that, you see, the Germans are losing. And that, to make a hiding place to be was impossible. And what had happened, there was two potato pits. And my husband made out a grave, and he made a tunnel to go in from one to the other. And it was no air to breathe. He made just a little bitty hole, that even you couldn\u2019t match up a light, a match to light up. We were there for nine months. The rest of my tale is the truth. Whatever had happened with my husband, he can tell you tomorrow. I fear not the Liberation. We didn\u2019t have no clothes, no nothing. Darling..."

There, everything that you used to do is under the government. Here, democracy means you can do what it please you. You can build what you want. You can build a business and make money. Pay the tax, the government wouldn\u2019t bother you. And you gradually start growing and growing and growing, if you are not lazy. If you work, you make. You don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t make. Over there, it\u2019s no democracy. You ask me right now about the Communism. I didn\u2019t want to say anything, but Ill have to bring up and to tell you what had happened, why we have to run away. As you know, I was in business. I didn\u2019t know that much (ph) about the Communism. In our place, where we used to live, was a George (ph) from the marines (ph). It was a captain over the eight . You know, you heard about . They were rough and tough. The way I used to buy the machines and different things -- and a knitting machine -- somebody want to have a knitting machine. And I found somebody who had a good knitting machine. And a machine that you don\u2019t have to buy the merchandise, you know, but you can make your own wool, you know. Okay, they got that machine, and the man gave us some money. And my uncle was there, still on the farm. And what he gave me was a hog, you know, a cow, a life, and some money -- and some different, you know, food I couldn\u2019t remember. I had potatoes and flour and so on. But as (ph) I\u2019m coming back, the girls from concentration camp was alive. But they come back, they didn\u2019t find no children, no husband, no nobody. So where they used to come? To the Ipps, you know -- in Lithuanian, Ipp-es. What I did, I didn\u2019t have too much at that time. So I had the potatoes, the potatoes and bread. And I had a big kettle. Put it up, peeled the potatoes with onion, pepper -- and it smells, 1t was so good -- and bread -- and I was feeding them with that. What had happened to me at that time -- when I got that cow, in that place where we used to live , there was the officer and the George (ph). And more, you know, from them. We took that cow in the , and we slaughtered it. And we -- like in a butcher shop -- we forgot to clean up the place. What had happened, all of a sudden that officer has to come down, and he had seen what he take. And he came to me, and he said, \u201cDo you know, because I respect your husband --\u201d I said, \u201cThat would change you?\u201d And he said he could send me out (ph) for hard labor for five years. What he did. I said, \u201c (even though it was his name), I don\u2019t know. I have been living in a democracy country, you can do whatever it please -- you can do whatever is good.\u201d I said, \u201cWe will take it out right away and we go clean it up.\u201d I think my husband wasn\u2019t at that time at home. They send him, I think to Beluge (ph), in Lithuania. And I said, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t mention it. Don\u2019t bring any harm to us. Hitler didn\u2019t kill us. Please.\u201d And he used to come. I used to make the , different things, the Russian food. But I could tell, and he was burning. But we got right away a person who came in and cleaned it up and gave them away everything that was there left. And he cleaned up and it was beautiful. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that that is not allowed in Russian to do?\u201d I said, \u201c law (ph), how should I --\u201d (You couldn\u2019t call them , you couldn\u2019t call them .) I said, \u201cHow should I know? Please remember one thing. We are raised in a democracy country.\u201d I said, \u201cDo you see, I don\u2019t have any clothes. I want to get something to put on for me. You see my coat? What I was wearing is here with holes in my elbows.\u201d I said, \u201cI have to do something. This is not making anything. I even don\u2019t have any coal to heat up the apartment.\u201d I said, \u201cPlease understand. Right now, I see the regulations, \u201cI said, \u201cfrom the Russian government. If you could teach me more, a little about that life, I promise you, I go follow exactly what you go say.\u201d And I was crying. I was strong, but I start crying because I was afraid for Jay. And now it\u2019s easy to have respect, you know. But that particular sd Siberian (ph) -- where would be my little Jay? And then I have more children who had lost their mothers. And I kept them in my place. I had about four. He said, \u201cOkay. I will tell you what you can do.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat can I do to make a living?\u201d I said, \u201cCan I bake and sell, you know, some little cakes, you know.\u201d He said, \u201cYes, you can do it.\u201d We made a little kitchen -- a stove, a little stove. And the wood was so big, like that. And in that little stove, I used to bake and make cookies. Different things. And then I used to take that to the lady that runs the restaurant. And she used to sell them, and I was making a little money. When \u2014___ came back, he told him the whole history, the way I did. Finally, we became good friends. And I told him, I said, \u201cI go follow all the instructions. But you will tell (ph).\u201d And that is no monkey business with them. They can send you away that you don\u2019t know where you are. And they can -- you don\u2019t know what you are anymore. And that was the life of them. Siberia. It came to a moment, that was enough. It was no life. It was - no life. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s come back, maybe about 100 people, or 200 people. Jay was -- at that time, he was going to school. They had the school for the children."

The cookies was no life -- to stay and to cook all day, and then to sell it to make nothing. Finally, I sold the house that we had. And I ran back to the George (ph).

And a happy people who wants the money to get out from Kovno to go into free world. So 1made money. The truth. I made money, I didn\u2019t have to work hard. But, each time I used to have something else to wear. I didn\u2019t wear the same clothes. [Crying] Everything that I was doing was fear. Fear and painful. We made some money. I made it. And it came the moment where we have to leave everything that again I had. And on our way, 12:00 at night. To make a long story short, I ran, not to the door, but I open up a window and jumped out of the window -- jumped out with Jay through the window. In the back yard, was there a truck, you know? And he took us to vendors (ph). Between three and four months, it took us to get in Berlin. And from Berlin, we got in in the American zone (ph). Four months, I forgot my name. Jay said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s my name.\u201d That\u2019s another thing -- cannot go on the same name each time. Each time, wherever we went, it was no flowers. They took out my husband from the train. We didn\u2019t know about it. But they took my husband because he was wearing boots. And all of a sudden, they have seen that he got a watch. I thought it\u2019s the end. But he said, \u201cLet me go. You want my boots? Here are the boots. In another place, you\u2019ve got your watch. Let us go out.\u201d We had been in Nobody\u2019s Land for four or five days. Snow, bitter cold. Jay got sick. It 1s just unbelievable, unbelievable what people can go through -- maybe because I was younger. Well, to make a long story short, it was in Munich, and they had there, my husband had a job. Then I want to come to America to see my sister and my aunt that was my mother\u2019s sister. I wrote them a letter that I want to come to America and I need your help. Didn\u2019t took no time. And I told them I don\u2019t want to be any more on the bloody earth. And we got the papers. I didn\u2019t know what to do, which way to turn and which way to go. In Israel, you couldn\u2019t go because it\u2019s no place with no certificate. So, finally, when we came here, people were warm, people were nice. But I didn\u2019t have the language. I didn\u2019t know nothing. And my husband has to start out life from the beginning."
