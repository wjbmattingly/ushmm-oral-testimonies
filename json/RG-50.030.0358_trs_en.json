It took the rich people who 7 had, you know, stores and they took him and send him to Siberia. And th at was before the war started up. So the rich people, some of them, they were lucky. They went to America, they went to another place. But here, I could see everything th e way it was. The midd le-class, _______ didn\u2122t bother, but who was in charge in a place like factory people, or you know, the other people, you know, what they had stores, bakeri es and so on -- the people went on the first list.

A little boy from the fami ly, what they knew, he was under the bed. They didn\u2122t see him. He had seen what goes on. So that little boy became a life that had to lay there. I just don\u2122t know. It is so many things. So many things. It\u2122s unbelievable. You wouldn \u2122t believe it, and nobody could 8 believe that people could be such murderers. Bu t murderers -- I judge the same people, the same people who we knew, they used to come to my house an d _____. They asked to help -- the same Lithuanian people, they slaughtered them.

So we had two ghettos. One was a little ghetto, and one was the big ghetto. We were in the big ghetto. My husband\u2122s sister, her name was Doris, she was married, had a little boy. And she was in the little ghe tto. I\u2122m going -- I forgot to tell you something. And getting back the way i told you we find out -- you know wh at they did? They took the rabbis. They got in there, they cut off his head and they para de with the rabbi\u2122s head in the street. You see, when I am talking, that cannot conc entrate. You see, I have to run from one to the other.

He told us we have to go and not delay because we are in trouble. Gestapo, you know, the police, you know from over there -- the German police -- they was looking for the people. And there was, ac ross from them, somebody left a little boy or a girl, to hide them. They killed him. It\u2122s so many things , I tell you. It happened so fast, where to start. And then, we came to his house. And by going back, to another farmer, he said, \ufb01Please, get in, all of us, in one place.\ufb02 Like this . ANd we looked, a big st orm. And we heard not a fire from that place. The Germ ans was running to look around. And we were sitting there for an hour. Cold, bitter cold, just like that.

Not one of you will be left alive. \ufb02 Because it was not allowed to keep Jewish people. So he was in 82 places. Each time in another place, each time. The way people running from one place to the other. So, when it happened, that case. And he let us stay until -- I think six days or seven. And he starts looking around, why the dogs was barking. Why the dogs was barking. Something was wrong in their house. He said, \ufb01I cannot keep you anymore.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Put us in the pota toes bin,\ufb02 you know, where the yeast is. Nothing doing. He got in contact with my uncle. And my uncle took us to another place. To _______.

They share with us whatever they had. And my uncle used to come every week and to bring us some bread, milk for my -- for Jay. And so on, because they didn\u2122t have anything. They didn\u2122t have a cow. They got only one pig, or two, and two sheeps. When we came there, my uncle came. And he said, \ufb01Here is that place. Try to be as long as you can.\ufb02 And the farmers, already, was afraid, that in case somebody will give him out. So all the farmers will get killed. So they were 35 watching already. You see, they was watching -- they was watching him that nobody should give him out, in case or now they\u2122re all in trouble. He came over there. And my uncle used to come there. But we have to have a hiding pl ace. Because we heard that, you see, the Germans are losing. And that, to make a hiding place to be was impossible. And what had happened, there was two potato pits. And my husband made out a grave, and he made a tunnel to go in from one to the other. And it was no air to breath e. He made just a little bitty hole, that even you couldn\u2122t match up a light, a match to light up. We were there for nine months. The rest of my tale is the truth. Whatever had happened with my husband, he can tell you tomorrow. I fear not the Liberation. We didn\u2122t have no clothes, no nothing. Darling . . ."

You know, you heard about _________. They were rough and tough. The way I used to buy the 47 machines and different things -- and a knitti ng machine -- somebody want to have a knitting machine. And I found somebody who had a good knitting machine. And a machine that you don\u2122t have to buy the merchandise, you know, but you can make your own wool, you know. Okay, they got that machine, and the man gave us some money. And my uncle was there, still on the farm. And what he gave me was a hog, you know, a cow, a life, and some money -- and some different, you know, food I couldn\u2122t remember. I had potatoes and flour and so on. But as (ph) I\u2122m coming back, the girls from concentration camp was alive. But they come back, they didn\u2122t find no children, no husband, no nobody. So where they used to come? To the Ipps, you know -- in Lithuanian, Ipp-es. What I did, I didn\u2122 t have too much at that time. So I had the potatoes, the potatoes and bread. And I had a big kettle. Put it up, peeled the potatoes with onion, pepper -- and it smells, it was so good -- and bread -- and I was feeding them with that. What had happened to me at that time -- when I got that cow, in that place where we used to live __________, there was the officer and the George (ph). And more, you know, from them. We took that cow in the ________, and we slaughtered it. And we -- like in a butcher shop -- we forgot to clean up the place. What had happened, all of a sudden that officer has to come down, and he had seen what he take. And he came to me, and he said, \ufb01Do you know, because I respect your husband --\ufb02 I said, \ufb01That would change you?\ufb02 And he said he could send me out (ph) for hard labor for five years. What he did. I said, \ufb01________ (even though it was his name), I don\u2122t know. I have been living in a democracy coun try, you can do whatever it please -- you can do whatever is good.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01We will take it out right away and we go clean it up.\ufb02 I think my husband wasn\u2122t at that time at home.

I used to make the _______, di fferent things, the Russian food. But I could 48 tell, and he was burning. But we got right away a person who came in and cleaned it up and gave them away everything that was there left. And he cleaned up and it was beautiful. He said, \ufb01Don\u2122t you know that that is not allowed in Russian to do?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01_______ law (ph), how should I --\ufb02 (You couldn\u2122t call them _______, you couldn\u2122t call th em ________.) I said, \ufb01How should I know? Please remember one thing. We ar e raised in a democracy country.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Do you see, I don\u2122t have any clothes. I want to get something to put on for me. You see my coat? What I was wearing is here with holes in my elbow s.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I have to do something. This is not making anything. I even don\u2122t have any coal to heat up the apartment.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Please understand. Right now, I see the regulations, \ufb01 I said, \ufb01from the Russian government. If you could teach me more, a little about that life, I promise you, I go follow exactly what you go say.\ufb02 And I was crying. I was strong, but I start cryi ng because I was afraid for Jay. And now it\u2122s easy to have respect, you know. But that particular _____ Siberian (ph) -- where would be my little Jay? And then I have more children who ha d lost their mothers. And I kept them in my place. I had about four. He said, \ufb01Okay. I wi ll tell you what you can do.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01What can I do to make a living?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Can I bake a nd sell, you know, some little cakes, you know.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Yes, you can do it.\ufb02 We made a little kitchen -- a stove , a little stove. And the wood was so big, like that. And in that little stove, I used to bake and make cookies. Different things. And then I used to take that to the lady that runs the restaurant. And she used to sell them, and I was making a little money. When ______ came back, he told him the whole history, the way I did. Finally, we became good friends. And I told him, I said, \ufb01I go follow all the instructions. But you will tell (ph).\ufb02 And that is no monkey busin ess with them. They can send you away that you don\u2122t know where you are. And they can -- you don\u2122t know what you are anymore. And that was the life of them. Siberi a. It came to a moment, that wa s enough. It was no life. It was - 49 - no life.
