I went to the Jewish elementary school, and basically in 1939 I was a nice supposed to go to starting my gymnasium, which is high school, in Hungary and when the classes started. And numerous classes means that we have a relatively small percentage of Jewish students that are admitted to the high schools. I believe it was 4 percent of the total of student population. I'm really not sure about the percentage. But, yes, in May, I was between those fortunate ones that were admitted to high school and four of us four Jew in class of about 50 started our high school years. The school which I went to, it happened to be a rather revisionist national and rather anti Semitic school. And as far as discrimination, certainly it was, but nevertheless, it was tolerated.

And they were taken most of the time to the Russian front. And the atrocities regarding the Jewish paramilitary personnel ______+ every day.

And afew who survived and came back at all had unbelievable stories which was very difficult to realize for us that they are true and they are really reliable information because our life was totally different and we didn't feel this tremendous pressure. We did feel pressure, but but as individuals, they let they let us at that time to be. It is true that the Hungarian the Jewish Hungarian professionals are slowly lose their jobs in 1941. There is a second Jewish law came out, said the practicing professionals lost their licenses, and there was a lot of restrictions. But as far as personal dangers, so to speak, it was far from us. In a sense, it was for these delusions, and they said to us that's what's happening across the border. It cannot happen in Hungary. After all, we are Hungarian Jews and Hungarians and that that maybe can happen on the east but not in a cultured country like Hungary and the usual hog wash that everyone is basically at leastin Hungarian assimilated Jews felt."

So we were aware of the fact and knew very well, and the the general policy lines were very clear of the Nazi party and Hitler and but but we felt that maybe in a bit we are somehow immune from this.

But you know what? I truly recall that, despite of the heavy anti Semitic atmosphere in the school, nobody said a word, not not just as though nothing happened. I don't know why. Maybe it was some kind ofa a how should I say? The consciousness? I really don't know what was the reason, but we didn't feel that this yellow staris makes any difference in the relationship.

About I think about three or four weeks later, there were massive air bombardment in Budapest, and many buildings were destroyed. And that was the second thing that I recall that the government they required the Jewish apartments to be evacuated for the casualties, as a matter of fact, those Christians whose homes was destroyed. So about 2,000 families were kicked out very swiftly from their home. That was the first one. And subsequently I believe it was in May that the law came that Jews has to be has to move to certain houses. There is a clear distinction with the marked houses. And then, obviously, our life totally crumbled because we had a couple of hours to evacuate our home, which was just I mean, you know, it's very traumatic, obviously, not only for a teenager, but the whole family. So we practically left almost everything in anda couple of other families which house become a Jewish house were still outside. That happened in May.

On the 14th of October, there was a proclamation in Hungarian radio in which the governor, Horthy, declared that that Hungary is jumping out of the war. So that was the tremendous jubilation, obviously. We were still on the same Jewish yellow star house that I already described. Though we were exceedingly happy that, my goodness, that's the end of the story, after all. The Russians got in the Hungarian border. They are progressing beautifully. And this is really now that half after Romania Romania wanted to jump out of the war and Italy, obviously. So that was in 1990 in 1944, October. So we thought that maybe we_ we will be able to salvage ourselves inthe meantime. The the they through the Swedish embassy, we knew that the SS left the country, basically. There was special SS dealing with Jewish things. So we thought that's the end of the story. And then on the 15th, which there was next morning, we look out in the window, and we saw the trucks for this the Hungarian Nazis with the Arrow Cross part in the automobiles with full regalia and the German | don't really know the realm of the SS, but I know that the presence become very heavy in the area that we lived. And that that was the turning point, obviously, which, as you know, for the Budapest Jews, because the Hungarian Jews _ the rest of the Hungarian Jews crossed the 700,000 already was killed in Auschwitz.

But truly so that wasin in October. And then the all the women and the all the males were ordered to one of the one of the large assembly places. And they then the march started. As you know, the fact being that there were no possibility already to deport from the from the capital. The fact 1s that the Russians already closed over all the roads to Auschwitz. So it was after October, there was no way that the deportation could be. The the Budapest Jews deportation couldn't be done because the roads are already fortunately not the Red Army that occupied them already. So that ttme I about two weeks later, a proclamation from the from the Arrow Cross party and the Parliament came that you have to move in the ghetto. They established a ghetto. I believe it was in __1n the first week of November, if I am not mistaken. But, nevertheless, we were very, very fortunate because we moved into international ghetto, which is basically the protected houses. We had Schutz Passes from the from the Swedish government, the fact being that probably decent connections I would think that, because as a matter of fact, my wife and uncle is in Stockholm, but I don't know how much would that affect us, because I didn't know my wife at the time. She was only ten years old. So anyway, at I made it too complicated. They had Schutz Passes. Asareason as aresult of the Schutz Passes, we may have been protected in the house, the Swedish house, which was _ they were around the city. There were a couple of houses. I believe there were around eight or ten center houses where the Swedish Schutz Pass bearers could move in. And I mean, you have half a room, but nevertheless, you had some kind of protection.

SoI I took off my yellow star, and I went out to the railway station that generally the transport is going through. I think it was about three or four days after my first visit there, indeed, they _ the train arrived. I didn't know at that time that my father was on this train or not. But suddenly, Wallenberg appeared, his people at least three other people. And suddenly, I saw my father coming out of the railway station. And said, \"What's going on?\" Said, \"Well, had Schutz Pass, and they let me off the train.\" So we, without any major incidents, were protected in the Swedish house. All right. The things were more or less, besides the fact that obviously tension was tremendous and the ghetto had horrible problems, the | = +the hunger or the or the only three months was the ghetto. But still, over 120 or 130,000 people were pushed in less than a square mile to a square area. The situation was horrible. And we were much better off because we lived in a protected house, and we had a half a room for ourselves, and water was running. And as a matter of fact, the telephone was working still in the building. And I do remember very, very, very clearly that it was Christmas morning that the first Russian show arrived to our neighborhood. That was a tremendous turn. Budapest was already surrounded. And they started, basically, the last stage of the of the Red Army. The front moved closer and closer and closer. And as the front moved closer and closer and closer, the the Arrow Cross people become more and more wide, and unbelievable atrocities happened.

On the 28th of December, suddenly broke the door of the house, and the Arrow Cross appeared, and everybody down from the apartments.

And it happened to be that my uncle was a lawyer, and as a lawyer, he had a big mouth, and the big mouth he was staying the responsible person for the whole bloody house. He was the he was the kind of supervisor of the house, if you want to. So this story, by the way, is written down very well in one of Wallenberg's book. It's by name, and it's it's very well documented. So I am just now quoting, as a matter of fact, from the book, telling of what happened. Basically what happened was there was a one working telephone, and my dear uncle called the consulate, which was in a different part of the city.

But about a week after we'd been liberated, we already started to hear about Auschwitz and Treblinka and Belzec, Majdanek, but mostly Auschwitz, and the reason being that the Hungarian Jews went to Auschwitz. Okay? So if you just think a minute and you say that the first trains left Hungary to Auschwitz in May the 15th, the last trains before Horthy stopped deportation and July the 10th, those are already the last two trains to take one. Roughly 750,000 Hungarian Jews were exterminated. The fact is that there were no selection for the Hungarian Jews back then. Soit's \u2014 it's such an incredible thing thatlam I it'shardto hard to believe thatIlam_ I have difficulties really to digest it today, 50 years later, about that time. It's incredible. And then, obviously, that, you know, the press started up very soon, because the other part of Hungary was already liberated. So the press is moved with the Red Army until got the information. I mean I'm sure you know the (?Castner?) business and all these things that that it was clear to them from the very moment from the Hungarian Jews' fate."

They say that's because Eichmann had become very experienced and things ran very smoothly. Nevertheless, I think that that's a reflection to the Hungarians. I do believe that the Hungarians not only cooperated but basically they've been the ones that caused this Holocaust in Hungary. AndI I I, personally, if I hear a Hungarian speak, I am taking a U turn. It's hard to avoid them. I think that they are absolutely a very high percentage of the population actively participated with pleasure in the annihilation of the Hungarian Jews."

Then did my internship at the University Hospital in Jerusalem. Then I was a year in government service because this was the year of the big Aliyah in Israel that was mostly from the Arab countries. There was an influx of Jewish population. Then I finished my year in the Negev Desert, started my residency in Rambam, which 1s a large government hospital in Haifa. In 1962 came to the States to finish my residency. I did my residency in New York City in surgery at Albert Einstein college of medicine, and I finished, and I got my fellowship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. And in 1969 I went back to Albert Einstein on the staff as a young assistant professor doing surgical oncology. In 1972 I was invited as a chief of surgery one of the University Hospitals in Tel Aviv. So obviously I returned to Israel. And I served ten years as the chief of surgery. And in 1982, I came out of my sabbatical, spent a year of my sabbatical in Baltimore, and then I was offered a position as associate professor at UCSD, which is University of California, San Diego. My mother became ill and, unfortunately, passed away, and therefore, being their only son, I had to go to return to Israel, and then subsequently we came back. And I am working and developed a medical group cancer group and teaching at Georgetown University. Hopefully, next year, retiring and going home."
