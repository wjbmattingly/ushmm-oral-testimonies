I do remember \u2014 I'll go back a little bit \u2014 during the time when we were there with our big family group, there was a lot of discussion whether to take Russian citizenship or not. The Russians offered passports to all the people who had fled from western Poland into eastern Poland, they could become Russian citizens. There was a lot of discussion because one didn\u2019t know whether to do that or not to, because if you did that, it seemed to us \u2014 at least that\u2019s what the grownups were saying, then we would never, ever have a chance of leaving what was occupied Russian territory, or Russia itself, because we were Russian citizens. So that was sort of giving up. On the other hand, the risk of remaining with the Polish passports, which we had, was that then we would be treated badly, possibly deported. There were talks about deportations to Siberia, and that was a different risk, but I know that we did not take the Russian passports because we thought that was like abdicating altogether.

But I remember that very distinctly. And the train would stop quite often and then the Russians would come in and they didn\u2019t mistreat us or anything, they didn\u2019t even come in. They would open the door and from the platform they would hand us the food. They brought big pots with \u2014 and mostly it was soup, I remember, some sort of soup. It was not great, but they did bring it twice a day over there. And also, we used to stop a great deal and it took us \u2014 we went all the way to \u2014 very far, we were deported all the way to \u2014 yeah, Kutskaya Oblast, which was near Yakutsk which is almost as far as you can go without going to Manchuria, I guess. And it took us six weeks to get there. So we tra \u2014 but six weeks with a great number of stops, because they did stop all the time, they stopped at different stations, I imagine when they needed the tracks they would put us on a side track, but I know we stopped a lot."

            "question": "Can you describe a typical day there?",
            "answer": "In the beginning there was utter confusion. We had to like register, we had to get our food cards. And they told us that we would go to school, children would go to school and they\u2019re go \u2014 and the adults would go to work. And then there was que \u2014 they talked a lot about what type of work and everybody was sort of \u2014 1t was also a new experience for all of us to have to work. I mean, my mother never worked a day in her life, and ma \u2014 and most other women certainly didn\u2019t, and the type of work that they had was heavy, physical work. But the early work was actually cutting the \u2014 what was it, the grass. It was tall grass that they cut and they gave us these sickles, that\u2019s wha \u2014 th-the \u2014 like knives. And all \u2014 that\u2019s what the Interview with Riane Gruss . January 5, 1996 first work was. The children did not do it, we did not do it, the adults did it. And they gathered it and tied it, and it was still very hot when we got there in August, it was very, very hot. It\u2019s a short summer. Soon after that, the typical day was going to school. And they did not have enough children to have a second grade, which I should have gone to, cause I already knew how to read and write in Polish, and I was eight years old. So \u2014 but they only had enough children for a first grade and for a third grade, so I was in the first grade, and we started learning Russian. And school was important. They did m-make it absolutely clear that we had to go to school in order to get our food, and school was important, and they were rather nice to us in school. The teacher was nice, and they kept telling us about, you know, Stalin and how he was going to take care of us, and how we are going to get presents from him, and actually when Christmas came around, they told us that we should pray for candy, and of course we didn\u2019t get any and then we should ask Stalin and the candy appeared. She distributed it and so on. Actually, this particular incident was very well portrayed in the film \u2014 what was it called? \u201cEuropa Europa.\u201d Exactly he had the identical thing happen to him that I remember very vividly, the same conversation in school. Anyway, so our typical days, wet \u2014 it very soon got very cold. There\u2019s very \u2014 there\u2019s practically no transition. We started having the first snow by end of September, beginning of October, and that snow never, ever melts. So when we were walking to school, we Interview with Riane Gruss \u201c\u00b0 January 5, 1996 were walking like in a \u2014 in a ditch, and on both sides there were these walls of snow that were as tall as I was. It was cut out, so that if walked in, an-and that snow never, ever melted, so \u2014 until the next spring, obviously. And the grown-ups went off and did whatever they were doing, I didn\u2019t see them. And the thing was to get some of the wood for us to make fire in the hut. My grandmother sort of cooked something. I don\u2019t remember ever being really hungry. We did have some food, and so I don\u2019t remember ever being really hungry. I do remember going to the store and getting \u2014 with those ration cards and getting our allocations. And they were mostly some sort of staples, I think. Certainly no vegetables, no \u2014 no food, no nothing, so that was bad, because we were very deprived of \u2014 of vitamins and \u2014 and that kind of nutrition. There was a little town not far away, where from time to time people were summoned for various reasons, and there was always a great deal of trepidation and fear attached to that, because you didn\u2019t know \u2014 it was usually somebody that they either wanted to recruit for some other work, or it was some oth \u2014 or they suspected somebody of being what they called the bourgoi(ph) you know, before the war, and they wanted to look into it. Two young people from the settlement tried to run away to \u2014 to the Manchurian border, we were not far from Manchuria. It\u2019s pretty far out there. So, a-and they either were caught, or they were \u2014 there was some mystery. I mean, I was only eight years old, but I remember the excitement that thi \u2014 were they caught, weren\u2019t they Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 caught, did they freeze to death, didn\u2019t they freeze to death. But when they were missing, th-th-th-th-the NK VD, which then became the [indecipherable] who came around and asked questions, you know, the Russian secret service, or whatever they were. The police. So there was some contact to \u2014 to that little city, which was not far away. It was called Auga(ph). And so, the typical day was just, go to work or go to school and eat and sleep. Were a lot of bedbugs, that was a terrible pest, and other than that I can\u2019t really remember that much, except big discussions inside with my \u2014 I had one of my cousins was already 15 years old, and he had been quite a good student before the war, and he knew quite a bit of history, and his sort of view of the situation was that we\u2019ll never get out of there. This is where the Russians send their political enemies, have done so during Tsar\u2019s time and have done so, you know, during the purges, and are doing it now. And none of these people ever get out. And of course my view of history was limited, but I do remember arguments because my mother particularly said you can\u2019t take that kind of point of view, and it doesn\u2019t have necessary to be like that, and we will get out, it\u2019s different. There\u2019s a war and they will be defeated at some point, and things will change. Anyway, those discussions I do remember, and I remember him saying there\u2019s a Polish saying that these are dreams of a severed head. So, whenever my mother would hold out these optimistic speeches, he Interview with Riane Gruss \u2122 January 5, 1996 would say, these are dreams of a severed head. So that\u2019s what I remember from there."

But \u2014 and then we still were a day, or many hours by horse and buggy away from that last station. But anyway, so she said she was afraid that they were trying to trick her into saying that my uncle had the money to buy it. So she didn\u2019t \u2014 so she said, I don\u2019t know \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have that kind of money to buy the ticket. So he s \u2014 so this guard said to her, okay, so if he doesn\u2019t send you a ticket, then you won\u2019t go back. So at that point she thought maybe she was overplaying her cards here, so she said, okay, she\u2019ll write to him and he\u2019ll make a collection among his friends. And at that point the guard apparently got upset and said, in Russia we don\u2019t make collections. His honor was hurt. So she said, well, I\u2019ll write to him and see whatever he wants to do. And she got out of that one, and actually when she did write that they said that \u2014 that we could leave, but she needed the money for the passage and so on, he thought also that 1t was some sort of a trick. And he asked her for her password. He asked her the name of a cousin that they had actually here in America, who had left Poland in the early 20s, or whatever, her first name. And when she gave that \u2014 when she wrote it back, he did send the money. And at that point, she went with the money and she was told that we could leave, Interview with Riane Gruss *\u00b0 January 5, 1996 and we left in May.

It was not bad, it was, by our standards this was top luxury. And when we got to Moscow we had to interrupt the trip and I don\u2019t know if we had to wait for another train, but I know Interview with Riane Gruss \u201c\" January 5, 1996 where \u2014 we had a few hours and he took us sightseeing. So he was, you know, he took us \u2014 he \u2014 he had a horse and buggy. And in Kiev, because we passed through Kiev also, and in Kiev \u2014 he was gone already, but we went \u2014 you know, he left in Moscow, he didn\u2019t continue with us. In Kiev my mother hired a horse and buggy, and we went around and she \u2014 she was very excited about being in Kiev, and she knew a lot about Kiev, and she was trying to show us the city, city is quite nice, by the way. And \u2014 well, my only memory from there is that as we were riding, they \u2014 my brother noticed a broken egg on the street, and he started yelling, an egg, an egg. And this egg sticks in my mind to this day. To him the whole city wasn\u2019t important, but that somebody could have dropped an actual egg and wasted it, was like, you know \u2014 so I remember that ride in Kiev. What I remember most vividly is arriving in \u2014 in Lw\u00e9w, because when we arrived in Lwow my uncle was waiting on the platform, and that I remember as being an enormously emotional reunion, but really, I mean she was very, very excited and very happy, and I was too, I mean, you know, here we were, we had arrived and everything was all right, and so on. And I also remember that he helped us with the little bit of luggage we had. And he had a man with him, somebody who helped him, who I later found out was like his, kind of manservant, who did lots of things for him also, in connection with packing, antiques, and delivering things and so on. So he wasn\u2019t like a house servant, he was more like a helper. So he helped with the luggage. And we got 1- Interview with Riane Gruss \" January 5, 1996 into a taxi, we actually got into a car, and while we were going to \u2014 to, I imagine where he lived, because we were supposed to go to his, I guess to hi \u2014 he was taking us to his house. While we were going there, my mother asked whether he had heard something about my father, was the usual thing. And he said, as a matter of fact he had. And he said \u2014 and so mother started saying, is he all right, is he all right? And he said yes, actually, he\u2019s all right, he\u2019s well. And the whole ride was not very long, must have been \u2014 I\u2019ve been back there since, it\u2019s a short distance, must have been five or 10 minute ride. During those 10 minutes he prepared her that my father was actually there. And when we got to the building, there was my father standing and she fainted. My mother fainted, they had to carry her out, she screamed. And that I remember very vividly, I remember that was very moving and very, you know, I mean so unexpected. And I hadn\u2019t seen my father in over a year and a half or whatever it was, and it \u2014 and that was very exciting. And then we went upstairs and they talked and talked and talked and talked.

            "answer": "Right. And \u2014 and the reason he didn\u2019t come to the railroad station was because \u2014 my uncle and he had decided that it was very important to prepare her slowly, but since the distance from the railroad station to his house was very short, so even Interview with Riane Gruss \u00b0\" January 5, 1996 the slow preparation was not really slow enough, and the impact was enormous and she fainted and carried on, and so on. And then we went upstairs and I re \u2014 I just remember that they talked and talked and talked and talked. And that was \u2014 that was it. And then we found out that my father had \u2014 well, he had his own set of, you know, what he went through, but the reason we were set free was because they \u2014 a relative here in New York had bought in Switzerland, or gotten in Switzerland, Bolivian passports which were actually \u2014 they were almost genuine, they were not completely false. They were issued by the consulate \u2014 the Bolivian consulate in Zurich, which \u2014 they were not issued by the government of Bolivia. They had booklets and they had stamps and the consuls very often did it for their own gain. And so \u2014 but they were more legitimate than the ones who were later prod \u2014 you know, manufactured right \u2014 right then in Poland and wherever. So, anyhow, he had gotten the \u2014 these Bolivian passports, and my father, while he was in jail, and he ha \u2014 was moved during the 18 months he was in jail, he was moved to 11 different jails. They move people constantly. And the interrogations started from \u2014 from the beginning in each particular jail. My father never knew whether it was because they didn\u2019t have records, or whether it was a purposeful thing to exhaust people. Interrogations were always at night he told us, and the first few jails he was treated terribly, and he really suffered hunger. And later \u2014 and he, on the other hand, did something different which worked out well. He convinced Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Riane Gruss \u201c January 5, 1996 them that he was actually more important than he was. He tried \u2014 he did not play the [indecipherable] because he thought that it wouldn\u2019t work anyway. He was a very imposing, good-looking, tall man, and he spoke five languages fluently, was educated in Germany. And so he was a personality. And he was afraid that if he tried to tell them that \u2014 who he wasn\u2019t, they would find out who he was, and then that would be worse. So he sort of even \u2014 he told them who he was, and he told them that he had very good connections abroad. He did do some dealings with Lehman Brothers here in America, he had some dealings with Bernard Baruch, he did do that. Probably not as much as he told them, but \u2014 and they felt maybe that it was worth saving him and sending him abroad. And so when he \u2014 they told my father that if he wanted to contact his \u2014 his relatives and ask them to help him by sending in foreign papers, they would release him, and that\u2019s what happened. But we didn\u2019t know anything about that in Siberia, so when these passports arrived, they notif \u2014 they called my father one \u2014 by then he was in La Lubyanka. At the end, the last three or four months he was at La Lubyanka. By the way, it\u2019s a very luxurious prison. He had a beautiful room he told us, with Persian rugs, and they treated him like a king. Wonderful food, he went out for a walk every day. Those were the people \u2014 you never knew in Russia what was going to happen \u2014 those were the people that they subsequently probably released. Anyhow, to make a long story short, he said that they notified him one day that the passports had Interview with Riane Gruss \u201c January 5, 1996 arrived, and he would be able to leave whenever he felt like it. And at that point, he said he wasn\u2019t going to leave until he found out what happened to us. Took them three months to locate us. And three months later, I forgot to say, the first time they called my mother, they asked her to give them a picture of herself and the two children, and they didn\u2019t say why. And that picture took them a long time to send it from Siberia to Moscow, and it actually came to the Lubyanka and the \u2014 the inspector showed it to my father and said, is this your wife? We found her, we know now where she is. And that\u2019s when they told us to go back, or sent us back. So there was some rhyme and reason to it, and that\u2019s when \u2014 and \u2014 and they released him, or he left on hi \u2014 of his own free will. He was \u2014 when \u2014 when they told him that we got on the train. So that\u2019s how we were reunited, and we had now these Bolivian passports. And we were supposed to leave on the 24\" of June, 1941, and we were supposed to go all the way east again, via Japan to leave Russia, and to go to, presumably Bolivia at some point. But the 22\u2122 of June, Germany invaded Russia, and so we never made it. We had everything, we \u2014 we had the train tickets, we were packed, we had everything. So that was a very bad break for us because we \u2014 the da \u2014 the Russians evacuated very efficiently. I mean, they \u2014 they left, and they didn\u2019t take anyone with them. We tried to ask them to take us with them, but there was no way, they weren\u2019t going to take any civilians at all, and they didn\u2019t. And so we \u2014 we stayed in \u2014 in Lwow. And I remember we Interview with Riane Gruss \u00b0\u00b0 January 5, 1996 were in the cellar at night, because they were shooting and bombing. Not bombing so much, but shooting. There was a war. And during the night, I remember there was this marching at night, this very, very strong marching, and my mother said, the Russians are gone, these are the Germans, and I remember say \u2014 sort of \u2014 I always thought that she knew too much before anyone else did, she \u2014 and sometimes she was wrong, but very \u2014 most of the time she was right. And I said, how do you know\u201d And she said, because they march differently. And sure was she right, they marched differently. And in the morning, there they were. And so that was the hard \u2014 that was hard, because we were lucky in the way that we had the Bolivian passports, so we did not \u2014 we were not in the ghetto. The ghetto in Lwow was established very, very quickly, because they already had experience from Krakow and Warsaw and all that, so they \u2014 in Lwow it went very, very quickly. And we couldn\u2019t go out, because they were rounding up children in the street, they were rounding up people, they were rounding \u2014 you know, and they had these ratzias as they called them, they rounded up people, so my parents didn\u2019t \u2014 th-th-they were afraid to let us out in the street because \u2014 or themselves, for that matter, because they knew that these Bolivian passports \u2014 you know, they \u2014 they were safe \u2014 th-there was talk that the \u2014 we would be exchanged for prisoners. As you know, these talks went on and on and some people were sent, and actually \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone was actually exchanged, but some people Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Riane Gruss \"\u00b0 January 5, 1996 were deported and told that they would be held, and would be exchanged. These foreigners. Some people really had real foreign passports because the husband was \u2014 had left Poland before and sent the passport, was living already in \u2014 1n one of the South American countries, and so on, and the wife was supposed to follow. And so there were some real legitimate ones. Ours were not a hundred percent legitimate, but that didn\u2019t make that much difference."

Very, very scary, because they looked superhuman, they looked like gods, and I \u2014 I often had the \u2014 the feeling that maybe if we would look like they did, or be dressed like they did, and have these shiny boots that they had, then maybe we \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t hate us so much.

So I \u2014 I was just afraid of them, but not \u2014 but at the same time I thought they were great, you know, they were the \u2014 they were \u2014 they were awesome, that\u2019s what they were. I remember reading one of Elie Wiesel\u2019s early books, and \u2014 where he talks about the same \u2014 that he had sometimes the same sort of feeling, that if he looked \u2014 you know, if he could look like them, they wouldn\u2019t hate us so much. So apparently children did have that kind of fantasy. So I do remember that. I remember being very afraid. I remember \u2014 you asked me about relationships and so on, I remember my parents Interview with Riane Gruss \"\" January 5, 1996 at that point fighting all the time. A lot of tension, a lot of fighting, because the fights were always about what to do and what not to do. And my mother \u2014 my father was a very law abiding sort of straight kind of person, and he thought if he lay low with his Bolivian passports, things would blow over. If he followed whatever directions, or whatever ordinances they passed, and so on, then he would be all right, because you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t do anything to somebody who\u2019s a law abiding citizen.

After a few \u2014 after \u2014 we were a year with the Germans in \u2014 in Lwow, but after the first two or three months, my parents too \u2014 sent my brother and me to the country, because by coincidence, the chauffeur that they employed before the war, his wife\u2019s family came from that part of \u2014 of Poland, and they had \u2014 they were farmers, they had a farm, they were peasants.

Nothing, there was nothing. You didn\u2019t do anything. You just \u2014 you just stayed around and listened to what the grown-ups were talking about, and it wasn\u2019t very cheerful, either. No, that was hard. You didn\u2019t go to school, you did nothing, you did absolutely nothing. One memory, vivid memory I actually have from \u2014 actually this happened before the Germans came, because they \u2014 we were there for two or three months before, and I had very, very bad teeth. I suppose because of the result of this year in Russia and I needed fillings, and those were my permanent teeth, and they were \u2014 had enormous cavities in them, and I \u2014 oh, knitting. My mother taught me how to knit and how to darn, and I did a lot of that because that was something to do all day long. So I had this knitting needle, and I could put it right through my front teeth, they were s \u2014 and I was supposed to go to the dentist, they had no \u2014 and you know, there were dentists [indecipherable] anyhow, they had no Novocain. So, to do that, they had to strap me to the table and \u2014 to the chair, which was, to this day when I go to a dentist, I have a terrible time. But anyway \u2014 and my parents were having one of their fights about what to do. And I remember staying \u2014 staying in my \u2014 I had like a little alcove where my bed was, and it was early in the morning, and I was supposed to go to the dentist that day, and I remember say- saying to myself whether I should volunteer and say if they stopped fighting, then Interview with Riane Gruss \u201d January 5, 1996 I would go without crying and objecting, and I never made it. I was so afraid of this dentist and the strap and the pain, that I didn\u2019t make it. I let them fight on, because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do that, to make that supreme sacrifice. Anyway, aft \u2014 so then we went out and we were in the country. There I remember digging potatoes, which was great fun, by the way. And then they made fires, and they roasted the potatoes. I remember Christmas there, where we baked a \u2014 there we had something to do. That was, you see, the difference. I didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t go out, because they didn\u2019t want us to see the other farmers, and we didn\u2019t go to church, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 because they all went to church on Sunday, but we didn\u2019t, we were actually hidden. So we only stayed on \u2014 in the field near to their house. And I remember the animals, I remember milking cows, I remember drinking milk straight from the cow. I remember feeding them, I remember the digging of potatoes. So that was actually not \u2014 it was a peaceful kind of interlude, so to speak. And \u2014"

These people didn\u2019t live very long, so \u2014 but anyway, she \u2014 and so my par \u2014 and my parents were hidden in his office behind a wardrobe at the end, it was really \u2014 they couldn\u2019t leave his office, they were like behind a big wardrobe, a partition or something. I wasn\u2019t there, so I don\u2019t know, but my \u2014 but that\u2019s what they told me. And you see, and that\u2019s why it was important to get us out of the way, because you couldn\u2019t hide us together like that. And then \u2014 then my par \u2014 Interview with Riane Gruss m January 5, 1996 you see, my parents at some point realized that they would never survive, or that they would be deported with the Bolivian passport, that the Bolivian passports would not save them from deportations. And you see, there, there was a big difference of opinion between my parents, because my father believed that we would be exchanged, and my mother said no way, this is all \u2014 you know, they\u2019ll never exchange anybody for anybody. And they\u2019ll just take us like everybody else, and kill us. So the \u2014 1n the end they made the decision that we would go illegally across the border to Hungary. And \u2014 which was a very risky business, but apparently they came to the conclusion that it would be less risky than staying with these Bolivian passports in Lw\u00e9w. My uncle had gone before. He went before because he was \u2014 he didn\u2019t have any foreign passport, and he was what they dec \u2014 what they designated as a necessary Jew, because he helped \u2014 just like he helped the Russians to identify what they were robbing, he then did the same for the Germans, because they were \u2014 they were robbing things, and they had these warehouses where they stored them, and they had to decide what to take to Germany, what to send to Germany, what not to send to Germany, what to steal, what not to steal for themselves, and so on, so they needed experts to tell them what\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t, you know, like in every other area, you know, what is a good painting, what is a good carpet, what is good china, what is good silver, what is \u2014 and so on. So my uncle got, since he had that kind of job with the Interview with Riane Gruss . January 5, 1996 Russians, he stayed on and they took over this warehouse, and so he stayed with them. And he became \u2014 my uncle was a very charismatic person and became very friendly with the guy who ran this warehouse. And so first he had like a certificate as a notwendig Jude, you know one of these Jews who were necessary for the German Reich. And then he was arrested twice and badly beaten and both times this German was able to get him out on the \u2014 saying that he was a necessary person. But my uncle realized that this is not going to work a third time, besides he suffered terribly, was terribly beaten. And so he decided to \u2014 to take \u2014 to run \u2014 to escape to Hungary, and then we followed. And I remember that crossing of the border, because that was a terrible experience, because you see, they kept saying, my parents kept saying \u2014 I guess they \u2014 they knew about it and they didn\u2019t try to hide it. Many of these guys, they were paid and then they took people directly to the nearest police outpost. And there was no way you could pretend, I remember being totally, totally defenseless against that, because you were in a forest, and you had to cross \u2014 you didn\u2019t cross on a road, you crossed like on trails. And you had to cross a river, there\u2019s a river on the border of Germany \u2014 of Poland and Hungary. So \u2014 and they were the guides, they \u2014 they were local people who knew how to \u2014 how to get there. And \u2014 but if they turned left or right or straight, and \u2014 and took you somewhere else, there was no way you could have prevented it, or \u2014 or even know. And that\u2019s what happened to many people. So I knew about that, Interview with Riane Gruss \u00e9 January 5, 1996 and I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I knew about it, because probably my parents talked about it and \u2014 and I remember being terribly afraid that they would deliver us. So \u2014 but we didn\u2019t \u2014 they were \u2014 they didn\u2019t, and \u2014 or he didn\u2019t, was one guy. And what I remember about that is that when we were crossing the river, there was a strong sort of current, and there were like big rocks and it was slippery, and my father fell, or slipped and lost his glasses. And that was a major problem, and he got terribly upset because he couldn\u2019t see without his glasses, he was very nearsight. And so I went next to him, or I sort of went back and I started looking for the glasses and I found them, they were caught behind the \u2014 and he talked about this as long as he lived, about these \u2014 that I found his glasses and that saved whatever it saved. But the effect of all of this was that we arrived in Hungary near Munkacs, and we \u2014 Munkacs was the nearest metropolis. And we arrived in the morning early, and we were \u2014 my father was wet, and he was in a suit, and he was wet from the river. And it wasn\u2019t so much that it was uncomfortable, 1t was in August, so it wasn\u2019t cold, but as \u2014 as they said late \u2014 it was dangerous, you know? Why would these people be dressed like that and wet and no place to go, in the park. We went to a park, because that was the \u2014 the most logical place to be. And what my father \u2014 what my parents with great bitterness recalled for years and years was that \u2014 see, Hungary had not been occupied yet, and the Hungarian Jews in Munkacs \u2014 Munkacs was a very Jewish place, they were living there a normal Interview with Riane Gruss \" January 5, 1996 life, and my parents told \u2014 you know, approached a couple of people, my father did, and told them of \u2014 you know, that we had just escaped from Poland and would they help us. And nobody wanted to help us. Nobody. And it wasn\u2019t even \u2014 that\u2019s what my parent were so bitter about, because it was \u2014 later on, you understood if somebody didn\u2019t help you, or the Poles, for that matter, if they didn\u2019t help you during the occupation, because they would be severely punished. But at that point in Hungary there was no real danger yet of being severely punished, and yet they wanted no part. And we later \u2014 I read about it later a little, I think they thought if they had nothing to do wi-with us, then the evil, and all this problem that\u2019s coming from the east, somehow wouldn\u2019t come to them. You know, but my parents were very bitter about it, I don\u2019t know enough about it. But finally somebody did take us in, and I remember that it was on the outskirts, and it was a\u2014 was not a Jewish family, some \u2014 some woman in the square told us to follow her, and she took us, and she had a barn. And she told us we could stay in that barn. So we dried out in the barn, and she brought us some food. And in the meantime, my father had some sort of a meeting point with \u2014 because my uncle went ahead, and my uncle was supposed to arrange for Christian papers with a fake name for us. You see, we couldn\u2019t show up as the same people with the same passports in \u2014 in Poland \u2014 in Hungary. You see, we had to then reinvent, and I \u2014 ourselves and the new identity. So th-the idea was that in Hungary we would be Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Riane Gruss . January 5, 1996 as Polish Christians, which \u2014 of whom there were many because there were some deserters from before the war, from the beginning of the war. And there was a colony of Polish people there. So these papers came to Munkacs, and my father got them someplace, and they came with a man with a car, who my uncle arranged would take us to Budapest already with those papers. And those papers, that I ha \u2014remember one of the most frightening moments of my war was that my mother told us that from now on my name, or \u2014 for me, and my brother too, my name was, since I was always called Ria(ph), that my name was Maria, and the last name was Wolinsky(ph). Our name before the war was Wohl. So the simplest thing, they dropped the H and made it into a very nice Polish name, which was Wolinsky(ph), so my name was Maria Wolinsky(ph), or Wolinska(ph) for that matter. And my brother was Stefan always, so there was no problem, was Stefan Wolinsky(ph) and my father was Athol(ph) and my mother was Gisele. But, when we were \u2014 you see, the - Munkacs in that area was still the border, it was the border strip what they called, and then there was a post, a police post that you had to pass. And there they stopped all the cars and looked and \u2014 and you had to identify yourself, or whatever, identification. And at that point, when they stopped us, my mind went blank. I suddenly could not remember whether our name now was Wolinsky(ph) or Wolsky(ph), which are very similar. And I was \u2014 and how I didn\u2019t die of a heart attack, although children don\u2019t usually, but I was trembling Interview with Riane Gruss \u201d January 5, 1996 and I was petrified. And this guard spoke to the driver, of course and the driver \u2014 they spoke Hungarian, we couldn\u2019t understand a word. And they \u2014 he told them that we were some relatives or something. I mean, it never came to us \u2014 to our having \u2014 it was all bribe \u2014 the \u2014 to identify ourselves, but I thought that it might, and I was sure that they would ask me my name, this was very important at that point, and I was very scared. And as soon as we started moving again, I said to my mother, I forgot what our name is. And she \u2014 and I was \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I saw myself also as being the \u2014 the one who caused everyone to be whatever \u2014 so, killed or \u2014 or whatever. So my mother said then, don\u2019t worry, she said, if you \u2014 if they had asked you for your name, we would have been lost anyway, no matter what they would have s \u2014 what they would have \u2014 what you would have said. So \u2014 but it was just, to show you how these things were. So then we came to Budapest and in Budapest we stayed in a pensionne. And we could not stay in the city, it was sort of in the outskirts of the city, but life was good. You had plenty of food, we had comfortable rooms. Apparently life was enormously cheap in Hungary at that time. And my father went to the city quite often, I remember, came back and then once he was \u2014 you see, the \u2014 the \u2014 the Hungarians were allies of the Germans. Gonna stop it.

They were not occupied, but they were allies, and if they found that somebody was really Jewish, and was pretending to be Polish, and had no legitimate papers to be there, they did send some people back. And that was the danger. It wasn\u2019t so much that the prison itself was so terrible. It was not very comfortable. They separated women from Interview with Riane Gruss ia January 5, 1996 men. All I remember is that there was a courtyard in the center of it, that\u2019s actually one of the nicer stories, with a huge tree. And the \u2014 the \u2014 my \u2014 my father, when we lived in this pensionne, we were not far from a forest, and my brother found, one day when we went for a walk, he found a baby squirrel that must have fallen out from the nest or whatever, and we took it home. And this baby squirrel, we had had him now maybe for a couple of months when \u2014 when we got arrested. And he was tame, he was \u2014 he would sit in people\u2019s pockets. He was quite destructive actually, he would chew things up. But of course, my brother absolutely adored this squirrel, and to this day he loves squirrels, and I do too. And when my father \u2014 when they arrested us, my \u2014 they did go back with my father a day or two later, and \u2014 to pick up some things, you know, the necessities, and so they \u2014 they went back with my father and he was supposed to pick up some things for us. And at that point the squirrel apparently recognized him and came to him and jumped into his pocket as he always did. And there he was, and this policeman had never seen a squirrel like that. And so he s \u2014 you know, the squirrel came back to prison, and he was there. And when we got \u2014 when he got there, we didn\u2019t know what to do with him, cause you couldn\u2019t keep him in the pocket all the time. So we let him go in the courtyard, and he went up and down that tree. He became like \u2014 everybody loved him. And luckily, we were released a few days later and the squirrel went home with us. But one of the other sort of more humorous thing \u2014 they \u2014 they Interview with Riane Gruss ia January 5, 1996 examined our papers and decided it was okay. But one of the more humorous things from that was that when they interrogated you, you had these false papers, but you had to have \u2014 you know, they could ask you what was your mother\u2019s maiden name, what was your grandmother\u2019s maiden name, and so on. So people of course, and we weren\u2019t the only ones who were in that situation, didn\u2019t have all that information, nor did they \u2014 so they invented these names, and my mother used to tol \u2014 told a very funny story of this woman who was interro \u2014 who was asked, you know, interrogated, and when she was asked, she would look around and pick an object, and say, you know, tay-tabloska(ph), you know, and just add the Polish ending to it, you\u2019d look around. So that\u2019s how things were, you know, and \u2014 and you either got away with it, or you didn\u2019t get away with it, depended. But anyway, so then we were there for another \u2014 must have been there about 10 days, and then they released it."

And no, I was not mem \u2014 we also were taught very carefully by my mother, who knew those things, because she had been educated in Catholic schools, we were taught the basic Interview with Riane Gruss ia January 5, 1996 prayers, you know, th-the Holy Mary, the \u2014 and Father, who are in heaven, the \u2014 the Pater Noster, because as Christian children we obviously had to know these main things. So those things we knew backwards and forwards in \u2014 in Polish, quite, quite well. We were not questioned about that. So then they released us and we went back to this place, but they told us that we couldn\u2019t stay there, because it was too close to Budapest. And they had, at that time they had some rules about Polish refugees in general. This was not directed against Jews. They did not want large concentrations of foreign refugees in Budapest, say they wanted them outside of Budapest in smaller villages and ar \u2014 and so on, areas. So at that point \u2014 by the way, the squirrel, after he came back about a week later, he grew, he became \u2014 a-and he left, he ran away. Probably went back to the forest, once he was no longer a baby, he was gone. And my brother was very upset when he \u2014 but \u2014 but he came back from prison, then he left. And then we \u2014 so then we had to move, and we moved to an area that was \u2014 that they told us they \u2014 that we should be in, and it was not far from Budapest, about an hour by train in Leanyfalu, and that was sort of a concentration of Polish refugees. We rented a villa. We could do that, we did \u2014 you know, within the circumference of where they wanted to \u2014 we could live the way we wanted to live. The only problem with that was that we were surrounded by Poles, and many of them not Jews. Some were Jews like us and some were not. More were not. And there the theater started. You really had to Interview with Riane Gruss a January 5, 1996 know how to pretend not to be Jewish. And these Polish people, they knew. I mean, this was \u2014 this was all a \u2014a theater. So there \u2014 first of all, we had a fairly normal life in the sense that we were not hiding, so my mother decided to see if she could find somebody to take care of my brother and of me, and teach us something. I mean, you \u2014 we had never been to school again. And they \u2014 we were driving them also crazy. So we \u2014 they took a \u2014 they found a lady who had been a teacher before the war, and she was the wife of a \u2014 of a \u2014 she was Polish, not Jewish, and she was the wife, a young wife of a Polish deserter. Most of these Poles were actually somehow families of deserters. You know, they deserted in 1939 from this army that was falling apart. And he was a tenor at the \u2014 at the opera in Poznan a Polish singer, and she was a teacher. And she was just as happy to work for us because she was paid, of course. And she would come in the morning and she would take care of us all day long. And I \u2014 that was a \u2014 very nice, because she would take us on picnics. She did find some Polish books. She made up a schedule, you know, we read, and then she had dictation, and then she had arithmetic, and then she had lunch and \u2014 and we were with her all day long, and she invented \u2014 she even \u2014 we even staged a little \u2014 I think one of the pictures that \u2014 that I showed you that you took was a staging of a Polish song in honor of my uncle\u2019s birthday and so on."

Interview with Riane Gruss \"= January 5, 1996 First of all, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nice, because every language should be \u2014 I have nothing against Yiddish, but by itself, it shouldn\u2019t be mixed, you don\u2019t mix languages. Now there it was a matter of life and death, so you had to speak Polish correctly, and that was s-something that was another reason why my mother was very anxious to hire somebody to \u2014 to \u2014 to be with us, though, because children pick up accents, and that we should speak properly. So, we went to church every Sunday. How did I feel? I had one problem with it, and that was a very strange one.

And my parents stayed with somebody, but I have no idea with whom. And during the next few weeks, two or three or four weeks, whatever that time period was, they made arrangements to \u2014 to try to cross the border illegally, to Romania. In other words, we tried to do the same thing we did from Poland to Hungary, now from Hungary to Romania. Romania, things were much easier, as you know. Prior to that, I forgot to mention my \u2014 you know, there were transports going, prior to the Germans arriving, there was a way of going to Palestine th-that was \u2014 there was some sort of effort made, and my uncle tried to get on one of those transports, because he had been a Zionist before the war, which my father was not, and he knew Hebrew, and he rated whatever, you know, an affidavit, or whatever they needed at the time, to prove that they were worthy of going to Palestine. And he, I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he got this fake \u2014 I showed you that picture, I think \u2014 he got this fake permit for a wife and a child, and my mother was supposed to go as his wife, and Stefan, my brother was Interview with Riane Gruss \" January 5, 1996 supposed to go as their child. But that never materialized. That\u2019s why there is this funny photo, passport photo of my uncle, my mother and \u2014 and my brother. That never materialized. But then, after the Germans came, and we were hiding for a bit, we tried to go to Romania. And the way that happened was we went to Szeged, and there there was a line-up. There was a house owned by some people who rented the rooms. You paid them. And that was just renting rooms. But then there was an aristocrat or a landowner who was \u2014 whose property was right on the border, and th-the \u2014 the way was through his property. And he was a kind of bon vivant before the war, or during the beginning of the war, and he had a lot of parties. So he wasn\u2019t conspicuous by having 10, 12 people at his estate at any one time. So people \u2014 so the first place where you stayed was a \u2014 at \u2014 in Szeged, and then you went at night to his property, and then you stayed there for one day, and there was this pretense of a party. And then at night you crossed the border to Romania. And the party before us was caught. Somebody must have announced, and they were all killed, by the way. So he was \u2014 they were caught, and somebody \u2014 and they came to get us, because somebody \u2014 they were tortured, and they gave out the address of where people \u2014 they knew that this was like a chain. My uncle, luckily, was not home when they came to arrest us. We were there, he was out on \u2014 in town, because he was supposed to go with us that evening, but he went out on Interview with Riane Gruss \u00b0 January 5, 1996 town. He was a \u2014 that was one of these strokes of genius. And he \u2014 and we were arrested, and they took us to the local jail in Szeged."

There was a day when they handed people over. And so the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Riane Gruss \"\u00b0 January 5, 1996 hope was that somehow, by some miracle, we would get out, I don\u2019t know if it was a Monday or a Tuesday, whatever, before that happened. But I s \u2014 I didn\u2019t see any way out, but it so happened that after \u2014 I\u2019Il tell you why it happened. I \u2014 that the day before there was \u2014 we were there six days \u2014 the day before they were supposed to come, they released us, and in the custody of a local lawyer, a Hungarian lawyer who was born and bred in Szeged. Now the way this was done is very interesting, 1t shows you how resourceful my uncle was. When my uncle came back and realized we had been taken \u2014 by the way, my mother left money and jewelry behind one of the pictures. They had a \u2014 they had a \u2014 a secret as to how, you know \u2014 anyhow [indecipherable] he got that, and he went back to Budapest, by foot, by hitchhike, I don\u2019t even know how, but he did go back, because his papers were not so [indecipherable] either. But he was loner man, he was very resourceful. And he went to the Polish committee, there was a Polish committee, which was in charge of Polish refugees in Hungary. It was like a\u2014a committee. And he knew a number of people; my uncle was very friendly with a number of non-Jews from before the war. He knew people in \u2014 and all the time, he was in touch with them. And he told them what happened to us. And basically, they figured out that the only transgression that we did, for all practical purposes, was that my father was not supposed to be in Szeged, because we, as Polish refugees were \u2014 we had designated areas where we were supposed to live, and Interview with Riane Gruss \" January 5, 1996 Szeged was not one of them. So they invented this idea that he went to look for work. And that was a very nice idea, but then they looked for a connection and they found the most prominent lawyer in Szeged, paid him off. He paid off the \u2014 I mean, this \u2014 the \u2014 the girl was his regular, you know, where he \u2014 where he was well known, and where he had his cronies. So that\u2019s how we got out. So we were actually \u2014 and this lawyer, also a wonderful man, took us to his house, and you know, really treated us \u2014 he was a Hungarian \u2014 very well. I mean, he fed us, I remember we took a bath there, everything was \u2014"

So anyhow, she said the confession went very well, but she always told it as a very amusing story, how he after that started improving. And he \u2014 so he was in this hospital for a few weeks, and she was with him. She \u2014 you know, they very often let relatives stay in European hospitals, it\u2019s still common in Brazil, even. But anyway, after that \u2014 and we were hidden \u2014 not hidden, but living with this woman, hidden in a way, because we couldn\u2019t go out. And then later, my uncle placed us with the janitor of a villa which was owned by Jewish antique dealer, who had been a contact of my uncles before the war. It was now occupied by a Dutch \u2014 I don\u2019t know, official, or somebody who was doing a lot of business with the Germans.

The previous owner, by the way, survived in one of those 101 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 Jewish houses in \u2014 in Budapest, he was not deported, he did survive. And so my uncle placed us in this villa, 1t was in Buda, right on top of a mountain, near a cemetery, I remember, with this janitor and his wife. So we were there. My parents, when they returned from Szeged from the hospital, stayed with some friends or some people they knew in Budapest. This was already now getting close to the end, and confusion was rampant.

My father was born in 1887, so when my brother was born, he was close to 50. So my father had very little \u2014 and he was a very autocratic kind of authoritarian person. He had very little understanding, knowledge or anything about children. Children were supposed to be quiet and obey. And my brother was lively, had nothing to do \u2014 I mean we \u2014 we had nothing to do, it\u2019s very \u2014 now I see how difficult it was, but as a result of it, he was a terrible nuisance. He \u2014 he \u2014 my father was constantly yelling at him, my uncle often used to beat him up, he was beaten very often. He was a terrible nuisance, because he \u2014 he couldn\u2019t just behave. And I, as a child, or \u2014 I was only a year and a half older, I was very mature, and I was very quiet. So I was no problem. My mother taught me how to 102 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 darn, my mother taught me how to knit. Later on I knew how to read, so I used to read \u2014 not appropriate things, because she \u2014 whatever Polish book she had, I could sit there and decipher it, whether I liked the story or not, because that was something to do. I did all kinds of word games and so on. My brother wasn\u2019t interested in any of that, and he didn\u2019t do any of that. So he really \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what he did except make a terrible nuisance of himself. So \u2014 and I always, whenever they f-\u2014 they also fought about him, because my mother protected him, my father got angry at him, my mother protected him. So he was a problem, and I always thought that he was the problem, I didn\u2019t know, nor did I understand that the circumstances were the problem, and he was just a naturally \u2014 a normal child who was in terrible conditions."

I mean, depending, different people took different things. But that was the focus, and with that they had a few oral histories. And it is amazing how different his perception was of what happened. How he was afraid \u2014 the basic facts are the same, but like he was afraid at different times, he remembers different moments as being the worst or the best, and \u2014 from me. And we were only a year and a half apart, so \u2014 but I do know that he was a problem. He was a problem because he \u2014 he had \u2014 he was a problem; made noise, got on people\u2019s nerves, because he was bored. So I \u2014 you know, I tolerated \u2014 I \u2014 I identified with the grownups and the people who knew that \u2014 that you had to behave. And \u2014 and \u2014 and he \u2014 and I saw him the same way, unfortunately, I\u2019ve \u2014 today I\u2019m sorry about it, as my father did, that he was a nuisance and he didn\u2019t know how to behave and he didn\u2019t know that he had to be quiet. So, I did not identify with him, nor with his problems. I didn\u2019t identify with his problems til many years later, when I had my own children and I realized that children \u2014 what children really need and so on. But during the war he was a pain in the neck, he really was. And, I think we\u2019ll stop here, because otherwise I\u2019ll be very late."

He was first in the hospital, then he stayed for as long as they could in the house of the lawyer who was able to get us out of jail. He was a lawyer who was quite prominent in Szeged, had a large apartment, because I remember it, because that\u2019s where went directly from prison, we went to his apartment, and we stayed there a day or two before my brother and I left for Budapest, and he \u2014 and my father went to \u2014 got sick and stayed on and ended up in the hospital. Now we are in Buda at the janitor of a friend of my uncle\u2019s \u2014 oh, not a friend really, but an acquaintance who was in the same business as my 105 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 uncle, he was a art dealer in Budapest, and he had a villa in Buda where he lived, and on the property he had a caretaker and his wife. It was a small house on the property, separate. And that\u2019s where my uncle placed us. And that\u2019s where we were living, and it wasn\u2019t bad there, it was fine. I mean, they fed us and they were quite nice to us, we were not supposed to be running around too much, although we could go into the garden, but we were not going out too much. And my uncle would come and visit us quite often. Eventually, my parents came back to Budapest, and we did not see them, at least I don\u2019t remember seeing them. And I think they stayed somewhere, with someone for a very short time, because then my father got sick again. And he went to the hospital, and from what I understand, he was operated \u2014 he had gall bladder problems, that \u2014 that was his u \u2014 these various stays in the hospital ha \u2014 were gall bladder attacks. And I think he was oper \u2014 not only I think, I know, he was operated by a surgeon as th \u2014 people called them then a professor something, pr \u2014 I don\u2019t remember his name. And the surgeon realized that they were \u2014 who they were, or what they were and he decided to help them, I presume. And he kept my father in the hospital beyond \u2014 beyond what was necessary. Today you can\u2019t do that, but then you did. And he was a prominent \u2014 he was prominent in this hospital, and my parents had a private room, and my mother stayed with him, which was very common in those days. And he \u2014 they were liberated 1n the hospital. So for 106 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 them this was a marvelous thing, because he just kept him on and on. And he wasn\u2019t terribly well, he was weak, he was after surgery, so there was some justification in that. But anyhow, that\u2019s where they were liberated. We, on the other side \u2014 on the other hand were in Buda in \u2014 with this janitor, and my uncle was the one who kept coming to us and visiting us. And \u2014 and yo \u2014 sort of looking after us. And while this was going on, of course the front was getting closer and closer, the Russians were coming closer and closer, and Budapest was encircled. So the siege of Budapest was about, I think, five or six weeks, it was quite long."

Then we went \u2014 so anyway, then we came back, and by that time we no longer stayed in the \u2014 1n the caretaker\u2019s house, because by that time the Germans were really on the run, and there was less danger of being arrested or something by the Germans. They were not so much on the run as they were occupied by other things. They were fighting. And we moved into the main house, and my uncle was able to get the old couple, who were actually the antique dealer and his wife, they were in a \u2014 what they called it \u2014 they were hidden someplace in Buda \u2014 in \u2014 in Pest, I think. I don\u2019t know exactly, but my uncle was able to get them out to wherever they were, and helped them come to our \u2014 come to their \u2014 what was their home, what was their house, and they prepared the cellar. And we were all in the cellar of the villa, because that was safer. 115 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 It was a real cellar, so it was more like a shelter. And that\u2019s where we were. So it was the old couple, my uncle and the two of us, and the caretaker and his wife would come in there and stay for a while and then go back to their house. They were in and out, I remember. There was a Dutch man \u2014 by the way, that\u2019s how we were actually able to stay with the caretaker. There was a Dutch man, I think \u2014 well, this will make a lot of sense, I think 1t was Menton(ph). Menton(ph) is a very well- known name because there was a book written about him, and then my uncle, after the war, was in a very controversial situation with him. Menton(ph) lived, or his friend, lived in the villa, and that\u2019s how we were able to stay with the caretaker, and there was no suspic \u2014 I mean, nobody looked at who we were and what we were. And so \u2014 but by then, Menton(ph) had fled, because he was obviously friendly with the Germans, and he was afraid and I think if he went to Holland \u2014 he \u2014 he was gone and the villa was empty. So the rightful owners came back, they were very old. As a matter of fact, she died during the siege. And \u2014 and then \u2014 and we all stayed in the shelter of that \u2014 or in the \u2014 what was the shelter, but what was n-not really a shelter, it was just the cellar of the villa. And during the fight \u2014 by then it was winter, because we were liberated in January. So it was freezing cold \u2014"

And I always wore it, of course, and that watch I liked a lot. And then when the Russians did occupy us \u2014 I\u2019Il go back to that, but one of the things that I remember vividly is that my uncle realized \u2014 I didn\u2019t know about it, but he knew that they were raping women, and they were actually no \u2014 not a very kind liberators, but \u2014 and it was rough, and he wanted to protect me, so he told me that \u2014 they also used to be crazy about watches, they took watches by the dozen and they would line them up on their arms, and \u2014 from the wrist up, and they \u2014 that was sort of like their status symbol as \u2014 as to how many they could get. It was really weird that \u2014 how they focused on the watches. So my uncle told me that, you know, if I wanted to protect my watch and not have them take it, and Ill \u2014 he knew I 118 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 loved that watch, then I would have to hide under the bed.

The other thing I remember distinctly is that the \u2014 they \u2014 the Russians je \u2014 since it was a fighting situation, there was a fight going on, he \u2014 [phone ringing] \u2014 so they would \u2014 th-the Russians, because it wou \u2014 they were fighting, I guess, to make sure that they survive, they would \u2014 wou \u2014 throw grenades into cellars before they came in, because that way they would be sure that it wasn\u2019t some Germans, who would shoot at them when they started coming down. So the big danger was that they would do that. So every time we heard steps on top, I went under the bed with my watch and \u2014 bed, it was a kind of cot, and my uncle would run up the steps and scream in Russian, you know, the \u2014 we \u2014 there are just children here, and we are friends and so on.

No, because he was equally as upset as \u2014 you know, it was 123 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 equally ha \u2014 people in tho \u2014 at least my \u2014 my experience was that except for my mother occasionally, when they were \u2014 when we were in jail, and things were sort of static, this was not static, you had to move. It\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like comforting a child who got up on top of a hill and doesn\u2019t know how to ski down. So you comforted, you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 but you have to get down. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s more or less [indecipherable] I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good analogy, but there wasn\u2019t time to talk. There was \u2014 you had to move, you had to \u2014 you had to walk, and it was at night, and it was dark, and it was hard. But he \u2014 I guess he pushed us. He \u2014 I don\u2019t know what he did, I don\u2019t remember, but all I remember is that that was a very difficult, miserable walk. And then we got to their house, and they had been liberated for a few days also, and they were still in the cellar, because most people s \u2014 remained there. There was no pl \u2014 mu \u2014 many of the houses on top were destroyed. Or it was freezing cold, 1t was warmer in the cellar. So they were down below, and there was hardly any room for us, but somehow we \u2014 of course, we had to stay there, so we stayed there. But the worst thing was that during the night, the Germans broke out from the castle, and it was \u2014 that was the last \u2014 they were encircled and that was the last time they broke out and that they made any stand, and that they re-occupied our house. And that was terrible. And they took out all the men in our cellar and they \u2014 at \u2014 these were people that my uncle knew and I don\u2019t remember who they were. All 124 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 I remember is that they went \u2014 they made all the men go upstairs and they killed three of them while we were there. Now, how my uncle escaped being killed, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t think he went up with them. They said, all the inhabitants 1n this house have to come upstairs \u2014 all the men. And so they did, and they killed them. This was in the last minute, we were only occupied for another few hours. And then the Russians advanced, and the Germans \u2014 you know, it was like a last desperate attempt on their part, and it was horrible that we ha \u2014 we were there. And \u2014"

And then we were re-occupied by the Russians, and we didn\u2019t stay after that, we just went as far as the Danube. We tried to cross over and my uncle \u2014 by then I remember he sort of used us, my brother and me, you know. Here we were these children, and the parents were on the other side and so on. So because there was a har \u2014 a priority for people crossing, there was a pontoon bridge by then. And they didn\u2019t want civilians crossing back and forth, I mean, this was still wartime. So he, you know, by saying 125 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 these are the paren \u2014 the parents are over there and these are the children and so on, they let us \u2014 he convinced them. And what we had to do was go from boat to boat, because this was a pontoon bridge, and they needed people to get the water out of these little boats, because these boats kept leaking, and they were filling up with water. So it took us hours and hours, because we were going from one boat to the next, slowly crossing that bridge and helping get the water out of the boats. And then the next dramatic thing was that we go to Buda and we went straight to the hospital, and they had on the gate, they had a list of people who had survived, and my parents were not on it. And then I remember we got a terrible shock and started screaming and yelling. And it turned out that the reason there \u2014 they had survived, the reason the list \u2014 they were not on that list was because the list was of people who were still there, who had survived were \u2014 and were in the hospital. And my parents, because they were there only mainly because of being hidden there, the minute the Russians occupied Pest, they left and went to some friends\u2019 house. We knew where to look for them, and we came there and \u2014"

            "answer": "Ye-Yes, in that respect we did. I mean, we knew that the Germans were gone, that nobody was going to deport us. But don\u2019t forget that the Russians and the chaos that was right after liberation. It was not paradise. It was far from it. You didn\u2019t know whether the Russians wouldn\u2019t grab you. Russians also did things that \u2014 unexpected things. They either arrested you, or they decided you were a capitalist. I mean, we had experience with the Russians, we had been with them. So we knew what they were like. So it wasn\u2019t like it was paradise, plus the physical conditions, which were so bad. And the cold, 1t was the middle of winter, was January. So it wasn\u2019t like you know, now you\u2019re free, and you begin to live. As a matter of fact, to digress a little, I understand there\u2019s a new documentary called \u201cThe Last Days,\u201d which I understand deals a lot with the aftermath, what happens right after. Because it wasn\u2019t that simple, it didn\u2019t just end and then everything was fine. There were decisions to be made, where to go, what to do. I also remember that when you \u2014 that 130 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 I felt that when you only survive \u2014 when your goal is to survive, you have more of a direction than after the war, when you \u2014 when it\u2019s no longer just to survive, but where to go, how to survive, what to do with your life. When you\u2019re only trying to save your life, your \u2014 your way of thinking is very, very different. So I almost remember a certain, like a lack of direction, like a certain, you know, let down almost. It\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like after a party. You look forward to it like I don\u2019t know what, and then afterwards you sort of, where do you go from here? That\u2019s the kind of thing I remember. And also the discussions; where to go, what to do. So finally they decided to go to the south of Hungary. And for me, at that point also was a very big disappointment, because my uncle, whom I worshipped, decided that he was done with us. He \u2014 he knew his family had survived. They had gone from Siberia to Palestine. He had \u2014 he had a goal, he was going to Palestine to be reunited with his family. So he, at that point, decided to leave us. And he was going to go to Romania, and from Romania I think there were boats already going to Palestine somehow. And I wanted to go with him. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I really wanted to go with him. I would have gone with him to the end of the world. And that I remember as being very traumatic, and he talked to me and told me that I couldn\u2019t go with him because I wasn\u2019t his child, and he had his own children and all of that was very hard for me to take. And also, I felt that he had more direction, he knew what he was 131 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 going to do, while my father did not. And so of course, he left and I felt very abandoned, very abandoned. And not only I, but our whole, family, because he was the resourceful one. And while my father di \u2014 was a wonderful man, but it \u2014 for peace time. He was not very good during the war. I mean, for \u2014 for these very difficult conditions. Not difficult, where you really couldn\u2019t just go a straight line, my father was a straight, very straight person. So anyway, my father da \u2014 so we went south, and I don\u2019t remember how we traveled. I think \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, you know, all I remember is that in the south of Hungary, we stayed on a farm with some people, and \u2014 Hungarians. And it was wonderful, because it was \u2014 it was spring by then. And we stayed there through the spring, and it \u2014 I think through the spring. Maybe for \u2014 for a month or six weeks. And there were animals. I remember I learned how to cut the wool off \u2014 they had angora rabbits, and so they taught me how to do that. That\u2019s sort of nice, and then how to weave. I could weave yarn. They had a spindle, or whatever it\u2019s called, and I could weave angora into wool; I was very good. Anything with my hands, I was very good at. And actually I had my first romance there, there was a boy of 17 or 16, he was much ol \u2014 and he was on the neighboring farm, and I learned how to ride a bike at that point, because he taught me how to ride a bike. And there was a little river where we used to go and walk along and look at pebbles, and do things. So that was very nice there. During that 132 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 time my father went back to Poland, to Krakow, because he thought that he would be able to go back there and resume life there. He did not want to go to Palestine, he was never a Zionist, and he also knew that conditions in Palestine were very bad. And he was a banker, and I remember he even \u2014 I remember his words. He used to say that the German bankers, there were many German bankers, much more prominent, who had gone there in the 30s and were still walking around with a cane. You know, with a little walking stick, because they had nothing to do, and \u2014 and so he felt that he couldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t want to go there, he couldn\u2019t make a living there. He could also not even contribute anything to the country, because he didn\u2019t have a \u2014 that kind of a skill. So Palestine was out. He thought that he could go back to Poland. The reason he thought he could go back to Poland is because there was a government in exile in \u2014 in London, headed by Mikolajczyk was his name, and my father thought that it was going to be a democratic Poland, and he thought he could repossess whatever he had, and start life again. He was robbed on the train going there. He got to Krakow and he saw the Russians had occupied Poland, and [indecipherable] but of course, conditions were much better already. But he saw that there was no one to talk to, that that \u2014 no one was \u2014 you know, he would have to deal with the Russians. Anyhow, he came to the conclusion he couldn\u2019t do it. So he came back to \u2014 to Mako and he decided that we should go to Vienna, which was 133 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 actually, in the long run, a good decision, because he had a great deal of property in Vienna. Vienna had just been liberated, and Vienna was in four occupational zones. And he would establish the fact that he survived, claim whatever he had claims on, and he thought maybe there. So that I remember, we went back to Budapest and from Budapest we took a train. And by then there was a train going, but there were like millions of people on the station, everybody had bundles and it was cold and it \u2014 it was horrible. It was really quite difficult."

Since I had so much money, and there was nothing to buy with it really, the theater was active in \u2014 in Vienna.

And then we slept, and the next morning we went on to Krakow.

What I do remember 1s that I, for the first time, I found about Jewish things, because my grandfather ate kosher, and so did my aunt. And I remember that when I get \u2014 got back from Vienna, my mother showed me, there was this one shelf of a few cups and things, and she told me not to touch those, because those were my grandfather\u2019s dishes and I wasn\u2019t supposed to touch them. But I still didn\u2019t have a clear picture as 145 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 to exactly why, but I remember that he was a very nice man, and my aunt was very nice, and again, my concerns were different.

But I wasn\u2019t very impressed, because again, by then it was a little cleaned up already, and it \u2014 while it was very destroyed, I was not exactly at an age where I could appreciate it, that these wonderful buildings were destroyed. And it was nothing compared with what Budapest looked like. I mean, I knew what the city that\u2019s destroyed is a few hours 146 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 after, that\u2019s very different. So I wasn\u2019t \u2014 that didn\u2019t make any impression on me. As far as Jewish memorials, we never went to any of them. My parents \u2014 you know, as far as the ghetto, or the site of the ghetto and so on. No, I think this is an [indecipherable] that 1s now very \u2014 you know, people do it and I\u2019m going to say something that\u2019s going to shock everybody, but I think that \u2014 I myself feel that there\u2019s \u2014 when we really needed help and support right after the war, and when I came to Brazil and \u2014 and, you know, I had a need to talk about what happened to us, in order to inform people I had close contact with, schoolmates and so on, nobody was interested. Nobody was interested. And now, I almost think it\u2019s too much, and I myself am almost overdosed on the Holocaust, particularly on the superficial de \u2014 characteristics of it. I still very much like to read books on the ho \u2014 that have something to do with the Holocaust. Not memor \u2014 not memoirs, you know, what happened to another person who had a similar story like mine, I think on that level it\u2019s not interesting. But novels or fiction or anything that deals with the Holocaust, I will read, and I find some of them very interesting. But this sort of obsession with it now is, I think way overboard, you know, way, way too much. And not all of it\u2019s sincere anyway. So anyhow, we did \u2014 I don\u2019t remember doing anything Jewish. After the war, my mother was very gratified, because my parents did ask us after the war whether we wanted to stay Jewish. And both my brother and I apparently said 147 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 yes. I don\u2019t remember it v \u2014 I do remember talking about it, but it wasn\u2019t a long discussion, it was more \u2014 don\u2019t forget, we had these Christian papers. We had an option to stay who we were during the war. You \u2014 you did have some \u2014 you had a possibility, and some people did. They just didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with it any more. They didn\u2019t want their children to have to go through this, what we went through, and so there were all kinds of different solutions, let\u2019s say, or \u2014 or \u2014 or roads to recovery that people opted for. Options. So I \u2014 they asked us, and we decided that we wanted to \u2014 at least we said that we wanted to stay Jewish, and the reason was not \u2014 I was too young, I mean I didn\u2019t know anything, I never studied anything, neither did my brother, that I-I just felt that \u2014 that we were born, that is like, do I want to be a blonde? No, because I was never a blonde, and there was no reason to now become a blonde. So now that it\u2019s over, yes, so we said yes. But it wasn\u2019t such a big deal as it 1s today in general again, you know being Jewish was not what I always tell my husband, a full-time occupation. It was just something you were, that\u2019s all. So, after the war, we had back our names and our \u2014 you know, legitimate birth certificates and the whole thing. And we went via \u2014 we went to Sweden. In Sweden \u2014 we went by train, I think \u2014 in Sweden we had to wait a long time, we were in Stockholm for about three months. We didn\u2019t get to Brazil til October, so we must have been there \u2014 not three months, maybe a little shorter, 148 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 because the trip took about four or five weeks on the \u2014 on a freighter.

So I was only there for about two months, and also ba \u2014 by \u2014 by the time I returned from Vienna, when this man took me home to my parents, I was told that the reason they brought me over is because they already had the visas and it was just a matter of getting everything else settled and we were leaving. So it wasn\u2019t like you know, I was settling down anywhere. So I was very ha \u2014 then there was a good feeling. Leaving for Sweden was a good feeling was \u2014 because it was the beginning of something new and something that we knew had to happen, is us settling somewhere. Now Brazil was the goal and Sweden was certainly a good and easy country to \u2014 to wait in. And that\u2019s what happened. We waited in Sweden in \u2014 in Stockholm we stayed in \u2014 in zak \u2014 some sort of a pensionne, boarding house, very comfortable. And the only thing we thought was terrible was the Swedish food, which 1s very, very different from any food we had \u2014 150 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 we ever had before. There\u2019s a lot of, as you know, cold fish and herrings and so on. And in addition to that, they have \u2014 their desserts are not sweet, so we were shocked that things that looked like a cake, turned out to be salty. So th \u2014 it was always a bit of a surprise. The other thing that struck us, and we must have arrived in Sweden in August, because they have very little sunshine there, and the minute the sun would come out in front of the opera, we \u2014 we lived not far from the opera, there were steps, and there were these people sitting down and with their faces leaning up and looking at the sun, and you know, every few moments of sunshine was a big thing.

And \u2014 but I had no clue as to why. And then she induced the miscarriage. So I remember there was a lot of blood and she told me that was a very heavy menstruation. I was the one that was cleaning it up. So that was not a happy thing, but I didn\u2019t know that it was that until many years later. And then she recovered and we waited, and my father came back, eventually, we went to Goteborg.

I knew that Rio, its capital, and that\u2019s where we were going, was supposed to be a beautiful city. And also I knew that we knew a number of people there; that I knew. And also my father, not only that \u2014 that his former partner was there, but also my father was married before, so my mother was his second wife, and he had two daughters by his first wife, and the older one, with her husband and son, were in Brazil; that was another reason why we went there. And my nephew, her son, was only two and a half years younger than I am, and a year younger than my brother. So I knew that \u2014 that there was some sort of family. My father never had a very good relationship with her before or after the war, but that\u2019s a different story. But anyhow, I knew they were there. And what did it mean? It meant a certain, imagine, permanence, but not a happy one. Not \u2014 not for me. I had \u2014 I had \u2014 I was open to it, but my mother was very unhappy, she didn\u2019t want to go to Brazil, so there was a lot of problems for \u2014 about that, because my mother really wanted to go to Palestine. And she made it very clear when my uncle left, she wanted to do it. My father didn\u2019t want to take the 155 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 chance, and of course, she couldn\u2019t do it. But she felt that Brazil was really a very, very, very, you know, contrary, different country, and she felt very strongly that she had nothing in common with that culture, and talked a lot about it. I remember that I, for myself, felt that she was exaggerating, that she was making it \u2014 being negative, and I didn\u2019t want to be negative at that point.

Anyhow, she felt that after surviving the war, there was really nothing for in Brazil. It was a strange country, a tropical country, she kept saying it was a tropical country, a strange country, and it really made no sense to go there, and she was very unhappy about it. And when they argued about it, th-the interesting thing was that she used to say that my brother, who was much more \u2014 you know, was younger and much more sort of very different, less settled than I was at that \u2014 you \u2014 she used to warn my father and say, you na \u2014 he\u2019s going to get used to this country, and you see, he\u2019ll end up marrying out of faith.

And that\u2019s exactly what I [indecipherable]. And that was horrible, that was just awful.

I have a very vivid memory of the second evening we were there, we were invited to dinner, to my father\u2019s former partner\u2019s house.

            "answer": "I should really backtrack and tell you about my school experience, because I arrived in Brazil at the age of 14, and basically had no school, because I was in school about 10 months in Siberia, in first grade. I was in school after that again, after the war, in Vienna for about six weeks or two months. I was taught by this lady, this Polish lady in Hungary, and by my mother, so I la \u2014 that\u2019s how, at some point I learned how to read and write. Probably in first grade, but that was in Russian. And just before they deported us, I was in school for about two months or so, because I remember making lines and lines and lines of As and Bs, that\u2019s how they taught at that time. So that was in Polish. So basically I had never really been in 161 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 school properly. So here I was, and I was 14 years old, and I needed to go to school. So my parents found out, and I found out that the Brazilian system is exactly like the French system. Which means that you have to \u2014 they cannot put you any higher than sixth grade, because you don\u2019t earn credits, you have to work towards the baccal \u2014 baccalaureate, or wa \u2014 how you spell it, how you pronounce it, and they wouldn\u2019t take me above the sixth grade. They were willing to take me into the sixth grade, and then I would learn Portuguese, and so on. So anyway, I had to learn Portuguese. This, to me, was like part of the war. It was a terrible disappointment, because here I was, I was 14 years old. To go into the sixth grade was so humiliating. And I was also very tall, I was as tall as I am today, or if not taller, cause I\u2019ve begun to shrink. But \u2014 so this was a terrible, terrible blow to me, and there was nothing you could do about it. So someone told me, and that was my lifesaver, that there\u2019s an American school. And the American school does let you earn credits, and 1t only counts from the ninth grade. I was the right age for the ninth grade, so if they would let me start in the ninth grade, then I had a chance to \u2014 to be with people my own age, and graduate on time. Problem was that I didn\u2019t know any English at all, just like I didn\u2019t know any Portuguese. So, I \u2014 of course, my parents were convinced that it was six of one, half a dozen of the other, I did have to learn a new language, and that wasn\u2019t the problem. And I must say that I went with \u2014 I had to go with somebody who 162 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 would interpret for me. So I went with my half-sister, she spoke excellent English, she \u2014 she was at the interpreters\u2019 school in \u2014 in Switzerland before the war, her English was excellent. And she went with me. And we spoke \u2014 we got an appointment, we went there and they told me that if I learned English between October, end of a \u2014 now it\u2019s November already, middle of November, and March, because the school year in Brazil begins in \u2014 on the first of March. The long vacation because of the summer season 1s in the \u2014 is 1n the winter. So, they would give me some sort of an exam, that would have a little bit of social studies, they gave me some \u2014 they gave me a textbook. General science, a little mathematics. So basically sort of a\u2014 some kind of foundation. And some English and if I could pass that exam at the end of the summer, over there, by March first, they would let me cu \u2014 go into ninth grade. Now, when I took th \u2014 I studied like crazy from that day on until March first. And then my mother used to say that was \u2014 we had an armchair \u2014 oh, eventually we moved, we got an apartment. We had armchair that she used to say she could have sent easily to take that exam, because an armchair was so saturated with my sitting in there and studying. I studied from morni \u2014 morning to night, I had a dictionary. I had no lessons, nobody helped me, really. My sister occasionally helped me a little, but I really did it by myself with a dictionary, and my father knew a little English and somehow \u2014 and the American school was 163 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 unbelievable, they were so supportive, they really were. And when I was taking that exam, they gave me a dictionary, they let me use a dictionary. And in \u2014 and the only funny experience I had with that was that my mathematics was quite good, I was always good in math. And \u2014 but one of the examples on that exam had to do with dimes, nickels and quarters. And of course, there I had no idea what that was, and I had to leave that question out, but it was the only one I left out, so I did very well. And I started ninth grade at th \u2014 and I was thrilled, and I worked very hard, and I did very well. And I graduated from \u2014 from the American school when I was 18, four years later. And that\u2019s what brought me to the United States, because the American school did not have rights in Brazil, so I could not have gone on to \u2014 to a university or anything. So that fa \u2014 and I did want to leave, but it was because of that I really had to leave, unless I \u2014 I could have gone to a secretarial school and become a secretary, and there was some talk of doing that, but I didn\u2019t want to do that."

It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s an embroidery, and it\u2019s a rectangular, like a\u2014a\u2014 it\u2019s like a doily, but it\u2019s embroidered 1n a \u2014 1n a stitch, it\u2019s not crocheted. And I got that at some point, I think in Hungary, because very often my mother would buy \u2014 I loved to sew and I was very good at it, I was always very good at knitting and embroidering and all of that, and that kept me busy. So, I \u2014 so this thing, I finished after the war, and I brought it with me to Brazil. So in the middle \u2014 in the center of it, I wrote it was embroidered during the war years of 1940 to \u201945. I have it to this day. Did I keep journals? No, no, I never did that, no. The \u2014 a closest thing I kept to 166 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 a journal was when I came to brazi \u2014 to America, I \u2014 I was here alone, I wrote home to my mother \u2014 well, to my parents actually, but she was the one that answered more, although my father also wrote very often. I wrote daily, because I guess I was lonely, and also I wanted them to know what was happening, and I was so far away, and there was such a big sacrifice on their part to send me, that I sort of felt I should do that. And my mother kept all those letters. So those letters still exist, some of them are \u2014 most of them are still in Brazil, my brother has them. And \u2014"

And I did want to leave, because I guess that my feeling, after a few years there \u2014 you see, going to the American school ha \u2014 was a \u2014 it was a mixed blessing in some ways, because my classmates, who were all American, were children of diplomats, business people, and they kept coming and going.

But it was not \u2014 they were not in the country, and they certainly all left, after they \u2014 we graduated, they all went back to the States to s \u2014 to school, an \u2014 even if their parents remained in Brazil. So you didn\u2019t really have friends. Once the school was over, you didn\u2019t \u2014 not only friends, you didn\u2019t know anyone. That was the second reason. The third reason was that because my mother 167 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 ended up being very unhappy in Brazil, there was a lot of \u2014 there was a lot of unhappiness in \u2014 in my parents\u2019 home.

The country is really very, very nice, and the Brazilians are very nice people. And I later on met some, and my brother did not go to the American school right away. He later transferred. So he has Brazilian friends galore, and \u2014 and also because he married a Brazilian woman, he \u2014 so I know a lot of people \u2014 I knew some through him when \u2014 when ~ as an older sister when \u2014 because he brought these people home. And he \u2014 he \u2014 they\u2019re lovely people, and they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not anti-Semitic, they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re just very nice, hospitable, warm people. So \u2014 but what I didn\u2019t like there was that basically my social life was within the ca \u2014 what we call the colony. In other words, there were two Jewish clubs, and they were social clubs. And so the young people like myself would go there and there would be a record player, and you danced, and you dated these people and so on. But it was very, very provincial. I always used to say, by the time I woke up, if I 168 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 went to a dance, or \u2014 and stayed out, you know, til midnight and then slept late the next morning, by the time I woke up, my mother knew who I danced with, what I did, where I went and the whole thing. So it was \u2014 it was very, very provincial. And my parents social life also reflected that, you know. Lot of emphasis of who or what and where and when and how. So, because of that, I also wanted to leave, and when I came here, I had \u2014 to America, I came to New York, I had this wonderful feeling that nobody cared what I did, nobody. And I was on my own and I was free, and I didn\u2019t have to \u2014 to worry about anybody. I did like it, even though I was alone, I did like it very, very much."

He \u2014 my father was a banker in Krakow before the war, and my f \u2014 late father-in-law was in the banking business in Lwow in eastern Poland. And so they had done some business together. They were not friends, but \u2014 because they were living in different cities and it was a little bit \u2014 they 171 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 were different. But they had done some business together, and my late father-in-law found out from some \u2014 some Polish people from Krakow that \u2014 who were neighbors of his actually, in the building where he lived, was a family from Krak\u00e9w who knew my parents, and found out that I was here by myself, studying. So he called me on night and said, my name is Oskar Gruss, and he \u2014 he was \u2014 said, I knew your father, and I would like to \u2014 you to come for dinner. Now, I had gotten quite a number of invitations like that, because many people knew my parents \u2014 well, my father, before the war. And if \u2014 they heard that I was alone in New York, so they would invite me. And most of these ee \u2014 dinners were deadly boring, terrible. So \u2014 and most of the names of the people who invited me, prior to this call, I had heard about at home, you know, the \u2014 they \u2014 but this name I had never heard, so I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to go there for dinner, and rush \u2014 he wanted me to come Friday night. I said, I\u2019m sorry, Friday night I can\u2019t. So he said, when can you? So I said, Monday in two weeks, because I figured out \u2014 it took a week \u2014 it took five days actually, to write \u2014 to write a letter home and get an answer, so that would be 10 days. So it gave me over two weeks to find out who this person was. So he said Monday in two weeks, okay. And he said, we eat early, and \u2014 so be there at 6:30. All right, so I said goodbye and I said I would be. And in the meantime I wrote home to my parents, and I said such an Oskar Gruss called me, invited me for dinner, shall I 172 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 go? Who 1s it? So I got back an answer sure enough, and my father wrote that there was such a person, he was in the banking business, he was in Lwow, and he remembers him, you know, vaguely, not terribly, but \u2014 and that if I have nothing better to do on that Monday evening, I can go, I should go. So I decided to go. So I went and I got there at 6:30 sharp and I \u2014 my mother-in-law \u2014 my future mother-in- law opened the door, and I saw this blank thing \u2014 he completely forgot to tell her. But she caught on quite quickly, he mu \u2014 they must have talked about me, because once I stood there \u2014 first I saw this blank stare, and then she \u2014 she sort of caught on who I was. I introduced myself, and she was very nice. And then I saw the maid setting another place, so obviously everybody had forgotten about me. And then I sat \u2014 and she was very nice to me, and we sat on the sofa and she actually asked me a lot about what we had gone through, and wha \u2014 where was I and what was I doing, and so on. So, about half an hour later, the key turns 1n the door, and in comes my father-in-law first, and my future husband behind him. And my father-in-law sort of went with his head, oh my God, he said, cause he remembered he for \u2014 that he forgot completely that I was coming. Anyhow, then we sat down to dinner, and dinner was a disaster, because my husband had a sister who\u2019s no longer alive, and she was studying \u2014 oh, she was in third year law school, I think. And they were in Wall Street, and the conversation, even though I knew English, seemed to me that I 173 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 didn\u2019t understand one word, didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. And so that was dinner, and then right after dinner, we got up and my future husband said, I\u2019m very sorry, but I have an appointment, and he got up and he left. And I said to myself, I\u2019m going to wait 20 minutes, because I was told someone doesn\u2019t get up from the table and leave. But this was horrible, so I said to myself, I'll wait 20 minutes and then I\u2019m leaving. So, during those 20 minutes, we sat on the sofa and my father-in-law also sat with us, my mother-in-law talked some more. And she was very nice, I liked her. And she \u2014 and my husband came back before those 20 minutes were up. I later found out that he did have a business appointment on Broadway, not far from where they lived, at the Schrafft\u2019s, they used to meet there at that time, and he had no way of contacting this person, so he ran over, told him I can\u2019t be with you tonight, and came back, brought me home. So that was very nice. That was very, very nice. Then I wrote home to my parents that \u2014 described the dinner, more or less, in the way \u2014 and there was one other detail that I omitted. My parents-in-law had the large collection of Jewish paintings, you know, as they s \u2014 they just now actually was \u2014 part of 1t went to the museum, the Jewish museum in New York. But they were all Oppenheimers(ph) and Kaufmans, so they were these Jewish heads. And all these things were staring down at me. And my father-in-law and my future husband, this was a Monday night, were sitting in kippot. I had never seen that in 174 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 my life. So I was a little bit taken by that, you know, it was such a different kind of home, I\u2019d never seen anything like that. So that was a little strange. So anyhow, I wrote to my parents home about this whole evening, and I got a letter back from my father saying, in the year 1930, with a question mark, I remember sending him a present for his Bar Mitzvah. Why isn\u2019t he married yet? So anyway, so that\u2019s how I met my husband. We started going out, he started taking me out. This was in February, so it was about a year after I came to New York. And I went and \u2014 we went out from February til \u2014 til June. June I was going home for my vacation, because my s-school year was over. And I \u2014 he took me \u2014 he told me \u2014 he brought me a little radio, I remember, he brought me a present, the \u2014 the \u2014 just before I was leaving, and he said to me, I\u2019m very sorry, I won\u2019t be able to take you to the ship to see you off \u2014 I was traveling by ship \u2014 because he said, it\u2019s a holiday. And I said, a holiday? Well, it turned out it was Shavuot, which was a holiday I never even heard about. So at that point I found out that he\u2019s observant. He kept it from me, from \u2014 from February until June, he took me out \u2014 I didn\u2019t realize that he was ordering fish, because I didn\u2019t really care what he was ordering. But we went out a lot, and I didn\u2019t realize that he was religious. Never asked me out on a Friday, but you know, th-that was \u2014 I didn\u2019t think about it. So when I came home to Rio, he came for the Fourth of 175 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 July weekend, and he came to my \u2014 to our home, he met my parents, and so on and so forth.

And I had met this young \u2014 youngish woman who has an only daughter, talking to another youngish woman who has an only daughter.

So I \u2014 I told Brenda about this, I said, I never was concerned about \u2014 I mean, if the school took them someplace, I never thought that there was any \u2014 so Brenda said, maybe 1 \u2014 and I said, this must be because 179 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 they\u2019re only children. And Brenda said no, maybe it\u2019s because you went through so much when you were a child, that \u2014 that what we were doing was so protected and so normal, never occurred to you that something could happen. And maybe that\u2019s true, as the \u2014 I thought about it. It was just something that happened 10 days ago, I started thinking about it, maybe she\u2019s right.

And we went to \u2014 to Krak\u00e9w, and we ac \u2014 actually, it was the only time in my life, including the wars, interestingly enough, that I experienced outspoken anti-Semitism. Because during the war I never experienced it. mean, I knew they were murdering Jews, but the Germans were doing it, and I personally never did. I wasn\u2019t in school, so I never did. And \u2014 and the Polish people, I also have very strong opinions about people \u2014 Polish people helping Jews, because those Jews who survived like I did, at one point or another had to be helped by Christians. Otherwise there was no hope, there was no way you could have survived. But anyway, I wa \u2014 we were in Krakow and we went to visit Auschwitz. Was a Sunday morning. And we came back, and both my husband and I speak Polish, and we had \u2014 we took a taxi or a driver, or whatever. And we came back from Auschwitz, it must have been like two o\u2019clock Sunday, and \u2014 we went early in the morning, and we were starved. So we wanted \u2014 but we didn\u2019t \u2014 you feel funny after going there, funny. You feel very strange. And we didn\u2019t want to go to some fancy place for lunch, so we decided to ask the driver to just take us someplace where there\u2019s some food, where workers go. You know, a normal kind of place. So \u2014 so he said, okay, he\u2019ll take us where he sometimes eats and many of the cab drivers and workers eat there. So he said a very unpretentious kind of \u2014 that\u2019s what we were looking for, something unpretentious. So he took us there, and it was crowded, and it 187 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 was unpretentious and it was very crowded, and they were seating people together with other people. So we sat down \u2014 they told us to sit at a table where there was a young couple. They were speaking Polish. My husband and I were speaking English, because \u2014 but of course, they were speaking Polish because they were Polish, and we understood every word. And we sat down and we \u2014 I don\u2019t know, we spoke about, I don\u2019t know what we spoke about, but we spoke English. And there was no menu, so we got a big plate of sauerkraut, mashed \u2014 and big, big portions, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and some sort of meat. And I\u2014 I\u2019m a very good eater, but it was a huge portion, particularly there were a lot of these potatoes. So I finished everything except about half the potatoes. And she, the young woman, turned to her whoever he was, escort or \u2014 or boyfriend or husband, I don\u2019t know what he was, and she said to him, look she \u2014 he s \u2014 she said \u2014 and it\u2019s true that at that time there were still shortages in Poland \u2014 one always has to understand where it all comes from \u2014 and she said, look she\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 she said, she didn\u2019t finish her potatoes. That \u2014 and so he said, yeah, I see, and then she said \u2014 she was more virulent than he \u2014 she was virulent, he wasn\u2019t. And she said, they\u2019re probably not good enough for her. And then she turned to him and said, look, she has this big Jewish nose. It was the only time \u2014 and to this day I\u2019m really mad at myself that I didn\u2019t say any \u2014 something. But I was so taken aback. Also, I was so innocently 188 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 accused, because I just couldn\u2019t finish those potatoes. But the point was, that this was the only time, in all my life \u2014 I told my husband \u2014 the only time that I experienced anti-Semitism, you know, in its rawest kind of form. So, nothing, I didn\u2019t finish the potatoes, and they left, and so on. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 they finished, I mean, th-they had \u2014 she made that one remark, and then she didn\u2019t focus on us at all. But it was interesting.

I found \u2014 first, what you do is, what most people I think do is, you sort of look around and you figure out whether this person was alive during the war or not. That\u2019s what most people do and 194 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 I did that to some degree also. And I soon realized that most people were not alive, because they \u2014 they were younger, my age or younger. And even if they were my age, then they were children during the war, so then I started telling myself that you can\u2019t \u2014 you know, you can\u2019t hold \u2014 think about that all the time, you just cannot. And would I want to live there? No. Do I hate them? No. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say what I think about them. I don\u2019t know whether they are any worse than \u2014 | often wonder what would happen in this country if there would be gradually, as very gradually our \u2014 th-the Nazi racial laws were \u2014 they didn\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t done from one day to the next. People don\u2019t realize that. It came on very gradually. If there would be such laws passed against the black population, would we react, would we s \u2014 you know, some of us maybe the vi \u2014 but most of us would not. We would just sit quietly and \u2014 and \u2014 and probably not go out and help people and so on. So therefore I \u2014 I also know that helping was very, very difficult during the war. It was risky, it was dangerous, it was more than \u2014 I mean, in Poland people who helped were executed. They \u2014 there was no trial, no anything if they were caught. So, under those circumstances, would I do that for somebody else? Probably not. So therefore I have no \u2014 I don\u2019t hold it against them, I don\u2019t hate them. That\u2019s my feeling. I wouldn\u2019t want to live there, but then I wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere except here, so it\u2019s the same \u2014 same thing. But I have \u2014 I \u2014 no, I don\u2019t hate \u2014 I don\u2019t hate that \u2014 hate them, 195 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 no. Just like I don\u2019t hate the Poles for that one \u2014 I didn\u2019t enjoy that one anti-Semitic incident, but I don\u2019t hate them, no. I\u2019ve had some very good experiences with Polish people as well. We were on a hiking trip, P\u2019Il never get \u2014 we went \u2014 my husband and I, we \u2014 one of the trips that we took, we went to Krakow about two \u2014 two or three years ago when I start \u2014 when they started giving back property, we \u2014 I went, and we saw lawyers and we did this and that and the other. And then there was a Polish holiday, so we suddenly found ourselves with three days or four days as \u2014 a weekend, and over the weekend, and so we decided to go to Zakopane. We had to remain, we had appointments afterwards. Zakopane is 1n the mountains, in the \u2014 in the Tatra mountains. And both my husband and I enjoy hiking, they have wonderful walks there, so we went. And we met \u2014 it was a sort of difficult, somewhat steep hike for us, and it was after a rain, and there was moss and it was a little slippery. So climbing up was not bad, but I was afraid that it\u2019s not a loop. I wasn\u2019t sure it\u2019s a loop, and I was afraid of coming down the same trail. So, there was a young woman with a better trail map than what we had, which was not very good. And she was going up and I \u2014 we asked her whether it was a loop and so on, and she said, yes, it was a loop, we didn\u2019t have to come down the same way. And then she said she was a very good hiker, and she said she\u2019s going ahead, but she has two or three friends coming behind and they are slow, and they\u2019Il probably catch up with us, and we 196 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 should just follow them, and okay, thank you very much. We went up, and then sure enough there was a bu \u2014 they came up behind us and then we confirmed the route, and then they went ahead, and they were still faster than we. And eventually we \u2014 we met up with them again at the top where there was a beautiful overlook. And going \u2014 so, we already had talked with them, so we asked them about going down, which way the \u2014 you know, th-th-the \u2014 the trail, which was the best way to go down, the easiest way, we were looking for. So they explained to us, and they explained to us that at some point there\u2019s going to be a V and we had to take an \u2014 but there was another little trail, and then you had to take the left, but it was difficult. They said it would be a little bit maybe difficult to find. So, we got there, to that point, and there they were again. And they were sitting and waiting for us, and on the ground there was, in little pebbles, they had made an arrow which one \u2014 but \u2014 and they showed us that this is the arrow and they made it for us. And then I said, so why are you here? And they said, because we were really concerned about you, so we decided to wait for you after all. I\u2019ve hiked in America, I\u2019ve hiked in \u2014 in Switzerland, we\u2019ve hiked in France, nothing like that ever happened to us. Did they know we were Jewish? Probably yes, because the way we speak Polish, th-they \u2014 we both speak well, but we don\u2019t \u2014 y-you know, when you haven\u2019t been in a country for 45 years, even if you speak continuously, it\u2019s a little \u2014 the language is a little different.

The other sensitivity that I have is that I became aware of an organization called the Abraham Fund in New York, which is an organization that tries to promote better understanding and \u2014 and coexistence basically, between Israeli Jews and Arabs, in \u2014 in Israel within the Green Line and I\u2019m very active with that, because I think that, you know, having, like my husband said, having been a second class citizen in a country like Poland, one knows what it feels like to be an Arab in Israel, with the same problems of having an identity card, where you\u2019re \u2014 you know, the religion is stamped in and that sort of thing. So, because of that, I do have more of a sensitivity about that.

It was called, between courage and something else. Not a very good title, I 203 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 thought. A woman who is, I think a sociologi \u2014 a professor of sociology, whatever, and who wrote about women in Germany, ger \u2014 the Jewish women in Germany, between 1933 and \u201939. It wasn\u2019t even about the war. And I found \u2014 that kind of thing I find very interesting because it \u2014 it talked about how the structure of the family changed, as the men were losing their positions and were not allowed to wo \u2014 to execute, let\u2019s say, doctors were not allowed to practice, you know, as the racial laws progressed in Germany. Before the war, women tended to sometimes earn a living, sometimes the men became so isolated and so discouraged and so demoralized that the women were the f \u2014 th-the force behind the family. Also, when they had the discriminatory laws against children in schools, it was the women who went to the schools, and \u2014 and \u2014 and were 1n touch with the children, and heard about all of that. Also, when the husband was arrested, which happened very often at that point, or had some running in with the police, it was the women who went in and tried to \u2014 to talk to the police and tried to help the husbands. It totally changed the structure of the family. The women became the \u2014 the stronger part of the family, very often in \u2014 in a way that would not have happened at all, had it not been a \u2014 ina \u2014a-\u2014had this not happened. And I find that kind of thing interests me very much. It \u2014 It\u2019s partly, you know, German anti-Semitism, Holocaust, but it\u2019s not just a story of what somebody went through, but how it affected life and affected the families, and 204 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 affected every-everything; how it changed things; how it showed \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I also noticed that in my own family, that my mother was the much more, somehow, resourceful person during the war than my father, who had a tremendous position before the war. But once all of this was taken away from him, he \u2014 it \u2014 and I, of course, as a child I never understood what was going on. That kind of thing interests me, that kind of thing I read.

So I said to her \u2014 I said to him, it\u2019s going to go to the museum, the Holocaust Museum. And he \u2014 and he said why? And I said, well, you know, maybe someday somebody is going to study about what happened in Europe at that time, and maybe they\u2019Il look for somebody who was not very old, or was still a child and was in Hungary. And they\u2019|l look up in the index and they\u2019ll look up Hungary, and there\u2019II be one other story, it will be different from what Hungarian children went through, because I\u2019m \u2014 wasn\u2019t Hungarian, I \u2014 and ho \u2014 he said oh.
