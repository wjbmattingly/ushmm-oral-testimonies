But my father felt that it was not necessary, it was a panic, it was \u0152 also, I should actually rectify this. We did not leave September first, we left September third, because my father insisted on staying three days in Krak\u00f3w aft \u0152 when the war began, because people were coming to the bank to get money out, and he felt he couldn\u2122t leave and disappoint them.

They would open the door and from the platform they would hand us the food. They brought big pots with \u0152 and mostly it was soup, I remember, some sort of soup.

            "answer": "In the beginning there was utter confusion. We had to like register, we had to get our food cards. And they told us that we would go to school, children would go to school and they\u2122re go \u0152 and the adults would go to work. And then there was que \u0152 they talked a lot about what type of work and everybody was sort of \u0152 it was also a new experience for all of us to have to work. I mean, my mother never worked a day in her life, and ma \u0152 and mo st other women certainly didn\u2122t, and the type of work that they had was heavy, physical work. But the early work was actually cutting the \u0152 what was it, the grass. It was tall grass that they cut and they gave us these sickles, that\u2122s wha \u0152 th-the \u0152 like knives. And all \u0152 that\u2122s what the Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 45first work was. The children did not do it, we did not do it, the adults did it. And they gathered it and tied it, and it was still very hot when we got there in August, it was very, very hot. It\u2122s a short summer. Soon after that, the typical day was going to school. And they did not have enough children to have a second grade, which I should have gone to, cause I already knew how to read and write in Polish, and I was eight years old. So \u0152 but they only had enough children for a first grade and for a third grade, so I was in the first grade, and we started learning Russian. And school was important. They did m-make it ab solutely clear that we had to go to school in order to get our food, and scho ol was important, and they were rather nice to us in school. The teacher was nice, and they kept telling us about, you know, Stalin and how he was going to take car e of us, and how we are going to get presents from him, and actually when Ch ristmas came around, they told us that we should pray for candy, and of course we didn\u2122t get any and then we should ask Stalin and the candy appeared. She distributed it and so on. Actually, this particular incident was very well portray ed in the film \u0152 what was it called? \ufb01Europa Europa .\ufb02 Exactly he had the identical thing happen to him that I remember very vividly, the same conver sation in school. Anyway, so our typical days, wet \u0152 it very soon got very cold. There\u2122s very \u0152 there\u2122s practically no transition. We started having the first s now by end of September, beginning of October, and that snow never, ever melts. So when we were walking to school, we Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 46were walking like in a \u0152 in a ditch, and on both sides there we re these walls of snow that were as tall as I was. It was cut out, so that if walked in, an-and that snow never, ever melted, so \u0152 until the next spring, obviously. And the grown-ups went off and did whatever they were doi ng, I didn\u2122t see them. And the thing was to get some of the wood for us to make fire in the hut. My grandmother sort of cooked something. I don\u2122t remember ever being really hungry. We did have some food, and so I don\u2122t remember ever bei ng really hungry. I do remember going to the store and getting \u0152 with those ration cards and getting our allocations. And they were mostly some sort of staples, I think. Certainly no vegetables, no \u0152 no food, no nothing, so that was bad, because we were very deprived of \u0152 of vitamins and \u0152 and that kind of nutrition. There was a little town not far away, where from time to time people were summoned for various reasons, and there was always a great deal of trepidation and fear attached to that, because you didn\u2122t know \u0152 it was usually somebody that they either want ed to recruit for some other work, or it was some oth \u0152 or they suspected somebody of being what they called the bourgoi(ph) you know, before the war, and they wanted to look into it. Two young people from the settlement tried to run away to \u0152 to the Manchurian border, we were not far from Manchuria. It\u2122s pretty far out there. So, a-and they either were caught, or they were \u0152 there was some mystery. I mean, I was only eight years old, but I remember the excitement that thi \u0152 were they caught, weren\u2122t they Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 47caught, did they freeze to death, didn\u2122t they freeze to death. But when they were missing, th-th-th-th-the NKVD, which then became the [indecipherable] who came around and asked questio ns, you know, the Russian secret service, or whatever they were. The police. So there was some contact to \u0152 to that little city, which was not far away. It was called Auga(ph). And so, the typical day was just, go to work or go to school and eat and sl eep. Were a lot of bedbugs, that was a terrible pest, and other than that I can\u2122t really remember that much, except big discussions inside with my \u0152 I had one of my cousins was already 15 years old, and he had been quite a go od student before the war, and he knew quite a bit of history, and his sort of view of the situa tion was that we\u2122ll never get out of there. This is where the Russians send their political enemies, have done so during Tsar\u2122s time and have done so, you know, during the purges, and are doing it now. And none of these people ever get out. And of course my view of history was limited, but I do remember arguments because my mother particul arly said you can\u2122t take that kind of point of view, and it doesn\u2122 t have necessary to be like that, and we will get out, it\u2122s different. There\u2122s a war and they will be defeated at some point, and things will change. Anyway, those discussions I do remember, and I remember him saying there\u2122s a Polish sayi ng that these are dreams of a severed head. So, whenever my mother would hold out th ese optimistic speeches, he Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 48would say, these are dreams of a severed head. So that\u2122s what I remember from there."

And of course, she coul dn\u2122t believe her ears, I mean, sh-she couldn\u2122t believe that they were saying that , and she thought it was some sort of a \u0152 of a plan to trick her to \u0152 to \u0152 she just couldn\u2122t believe it, no on e had been set free. And so she said she just listened to them, and then she said, how will I go back, I Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 55don\u2122t \u0152 you know, I don\u2122t have money to buy a ticket, I don\u2122t \u0152 you know, how do I go \u0152 so they said, why don\u2122t you ask your brother to send you money to get a \u0152 to buy the ticket for the transiber \u0152 she had to buy a ticket for the Trans-Siberia railroad, which went from Vladivostok all the way down \u0152 back to \u0152 to Moscow . But \u0152 and then we still were a day, or many hours by horse and buggy away from that last station. But anyway, so she said she was afraid that they were trying to trick her into saying that my uncle had the money to buy it. So she didn\u2122t \u0152 so she said, I don\u2122t know \u0152 he doesn\u2122t have that kind of money to buy the ticket. So he s \u0152 so this guard said to her, okay, so if he doesn\u2122t send you a ticket, then you won\u2122t go back. So at that point she thought mayb e she was overplaying her cards here, so she said, okay, she\u2122ll write to him and he\u2122ll make a collection among his friends. And at that point the guard appa rently got upset and said, in Russia we don\u2122t make collections. His honor was hurt. So she said, well, I\u2122ll write to him and see whatever he wants to do. And she got out of that one, and actually when she did write that they said that \u0152 that we could leave, but she needed the money for the passage and so on, he thought also that it was some sort of a trick. And he asked her for her password. He asked her the name of a cousin that they had actually here in America, who had left Poland in the early 20s, or whatever, her first name. And when she gave that \u0152 when sh e wrote it back, he did send the money. And at that point, she went with the mone y and she was told that we could leave, Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 56and we left in May. We \u0152 we went to the train, just my brother and \u0152 and she \u0152 and my mother and I, and we went to \u0152 to \u0152 they provided us w ith transportation from where we were, to the end station.

We got very good food, decent food on the train and always hot water, what they called kipyatok . And then he would get us the hot c hocolate. It was not bad, it was, by our standards this was top luxury. And when we got to Moscow we had to interrupt the trip and I don\u2122t know if we had to wait for another train, but I know Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 60where \u0152 we had a few hours and he took us sightseeing. So he was, you know, he took us \u0152 he \u0152 he had a horse and buggy. And in Kiev , because we passed through Kiev also, and in Kiev \u0152 he was gone already, but we went \u0152 you know, he left in Moscow, he didn\u2122t continue with us. In Kiev my mother hired a horse and buggy, and we went around and she \u0152 she was very excited about being in Kiev, and she knew a lot about Kiev, and she was trying to show us the city, city is quite nice, by the way. And \u0152 well, my only memory from th ere is that as we were riding, they \u0152 my brother noticed a broken egg on the stre et, and he started yelling, an egg, an egg. And this egg sticks in my mind to this day. To him the whole city wasn\u2122t important, but that somebody could have dropped an actu al egg and wasted it, was like, you know \u0152 so I remember that ride in Kiev. What I remember most vividly is arriving in \u0152 in Lw\u00f3w, because when we arrived in Lw\u00f3w my uncle was waiting on the platform, and that I remember as being an enormously emotional reunion, but really, I mean she was very, very excited and very happy, and I was too, I mean, you know, here we were, we had arrived and everything was all right, and so on. And I also remember that he helped us with the little bit of luggage we had. And he had a man with him, somebody w ho helped him, who I later found out was like his, kind of manservant, who did lots of things for him also, in connection with packing, antiques, and delivering thin gs and so on. So he wasn\u2122t like a house servant, he was more like a helper. So he helped with the luggage. And we got i- Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 61into a taxi, we actually got into a car, and while we were going to \u0152 to, I imagine where he lived, because we were supposed to go to his, I guess to hi \u0152 he was taking us to his house. While we were going there, my mother asked whether he had heard something about my father, was the usual thing. And he said, as a matter of fact he had. And he said \u0152 and so mother started saying, is he all right, is he all right? And he said yes, actually, he\u2122s all right, he\u2122s well. And the whole ride was not very long, must have b een \u0152 I\u2122ve been back there since, it\u2122s a short distance, must have been five or 10 minute ride. During those 10 minutes he prepared her that my father was actually there. And when we got to the building, there was my father standing and she fainted. My mother fainted, they had to carry her out, she screamed. And that I remember very vivi dly, I remember that was very moving and very, you know, I mean so unexpected. And I hadn\u2122t seen my father in over a year and a half or whatever it was, and it \u0152 and that was very exciting. And then we went upstairs and they talked and talked and talked and talked. And that was it. [break]"

            "answer": "Right. And \u0152 and the reason he didn\u2122t come to the railroad station was because \u0152 my uncle and he had decided that it wa s very important to prepare her slowly, but since the distance from the railroad station to his house was very short, so even Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 62the slow preparation was not really slow enough, and the impact was enormous and she fainted and carried on, and so on. And then we went upstairs and I re \u0152 I just remember that they talked and talked and talked and talked. And that was \u0152 that was it. And then we found out that my father had \u0152 well, he had his own set of, you know, what he went through, but the reason we were set free was because they \u0152 a relative here in New York had bought in Switzerland, or gotten in Switzerland, Bolivian passports which were actu ally \u0152 they were almost genuine, they were not completely false. They were issued by the consulate \u0152 the Bolivian consulate in Zurich , which \u0152 they were not issued by the government of Bolivia. They had booklets and they had stamps a nd the consuls very often did it for their own gain. And so \u0152 but they were more legitimate than the ones who were later prod \u0152 you know, manufacture d right \u0152 right then in Poland and wherever. So, anyhow, he had gotten the \u0152 these Bolivian passports, and my father, while he was in jail, and he ha \u0152 was moved during the 18 months he was in jail, he was moved to 11 different jails. They move people constantly. And the interrogations started from \u0152 from the beginning in each particular jail. My father never knew whether it was because they didn\u2122t have records, or whether it was a purposeful thing to exhaust people. Interrogations were always at night he told us, and the first few jails he was treated terribly, and he really suffered hunger. And later \u0152 and he, on the other hand, did something different which worked out well. He convinced Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 63them that he was actually more important than he was. He tried \u0152 he did not play the [indecipherable] because he thought that it wouldn\u2122t work anyway. He was a very imposing, good-looking, tall man, a nd he spoke five languages fluently, was educated in Germany. And so he was a personality. And he was afraid that if he tried to tell them that \u0152 who he wasn\u2122t, they would find out who he was, and then that would be worse. So he sort of even \u0152 he told them who he was, and he told them that he had very good connections abroad. He did do some dealings with Lehman Brothers here in America , he had some dealings with Bernard Baruch, he did do that. Probably not as much as he told them, but \u0152 and they felt maybe that it was worth saving him and sending hi m abroad. And so when he \u0152 they told my father that if he wanted to contact his \u0152 his relatives and ask them to help him by sending in foreign papers, they would release him, and that\u2122s what happened. But we didn\u2122t know anything about that in Siberia, so when these passports arrived, they notif \u0152 they called my father one \u0152 by then he was in La Lubyanka . At the end, the last three or four months he was at La Lubyanka . By the way, it\u2122s a very luxurious prison. He had a beautiful room he told us, with Persian rugs, and they treated him like a king. Wonderful food, he went out for a walk every day. Those were the people \u0152 you never knew in Russia what was going to happen \u0152 those were the people that they subsequently probably released. Anyhow, to make a long story short, he said that they no tified him one day that the passports had Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 64arrived, and he would be able to leave wh enever he felt like it. And at that point, he said he wasn\u2122t going to leave until he found out what happened to us. Took them three months to locate us. And three months later, I forgot to say, the first time they called my mother, they asked her to give them a picture of herself and the two children, and they didn\u2122t say w hy. And that picture took them a long time to send it from Siberia to Moscow , and it actually came to the Lubyanka and the \u0152 the inspector showed it to my father and said, is this your wife? We found her, we know now where she is. And that\u2122s when they told us to go back, or sent us back. So there was some rhyme and reason to it, and that\u2122s when \u0152 and \u0152 and they released him, or he left on hi \u0152 of his own free will. He was \u0152 when \u0152 when they told him that we got on the train. So that\u2122s how we were reunited, and we had now these Bolivian passports. And we we re supposed to leave on the 24th of June, 1941, and we were supposed to go all the way east again, via Japan to leave Russia, and to go to, presumably Bolivia at some point. But the 22 nd of June, Germany invaded Russia, and so we never made it. We had everything, we \u0152 we had the train tickets, we were packed, we had everything. So that was a very bad break for us because we \u0152 the da \u0152 the Russians evacuated very efficiently. I mean, they \u0152 they left, and they didn\u2122t take anyone with them. We tried to ask them to take us with them, but there was no way, they weren\u2122t going to take any civilians at all, and they didn\u2122t. And so we \u0152 we stayed in \u0152 in Lw\u00f3w . And I remember we Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 65were in the cellar at night, because they were shooting and bombing. Not bombing so much, but shooting. There was a war. And during the night, I remember there was this marching at night, this very, very strong marching, and my mother said, the Russians are gone, these are the German s, and I remember say \u0152 sort of \u0152 I always thought that she knew too much before anyone else did, she \u0152 and sometimes she was wrong, but very \u0152 most of the time she was right. And I said, how do you know? And she said, because they march differently. And sure was she right, they marched differently. And in the morning, there they were. And so that was the hard \u0152 that was hard, becaus e we were lucky in the way that we had the Bolivian passports, so we did not \u0152 we were not in the ghetto. The ghetto in Lw\u00f3w was established very, very quickly, because they already had experience from Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw and all that, so they \u0152 in Lw\u00f3w it went very, very quickly. And we couldn\u2122t go out, becaus e they were rounding up children in the street, they were rounding up people, they were rounding \u0152 you know, and they had these r\u00e0tzias as they called them, they roun ded up people, so my parents didn\u2122t \u0152 th-th-they were afraid to let us out in the street becau se \u0152 or themselves, for that matter, because they knew that these Bolivian passports \u0152 you know, they \u0152 they were safe \u0152 th-there was talk that the \u0152 we would be exchanged for prisoners. As you know, these talks went on and on and some people were sent, and actually \u0152 I don\u2122t know if anyone wa s actually exchanged, but some people Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 66were deported and told that they would be held, and would be exchanged. These foreigners. Some people really had real foreign passports because the husband was \u0152 had left Poland before and sent the passport, wa s living already in \u0152 in one of the South American countries, and so on, and the wife was supposed to follow. And so there were some real legitimate ones. Ours were not a hundred percent legitimate, but that didn\u2122t make that much difference."

            "answer": "Scary. Very, very scary, because they looked superhuman, they looked like gods, and I \u0152 I often had the \u0152 the feeling that maybe if we would look like they did, or be dressed like they did, and have these shiny boots that they had, then maybe we \u0152 they wouldn\u2122t hate us so mu ch. In other words, I remember strongly feeling that they were superior. I believed they were superior at that time, they did \u0152 they \u0152 they \u0152 they look mighty and \u0152 and superhuman. So I \u0152 I was just afraid of them, but not \u0152 but at the same time I t hought they were great, you know, they were the \u0152 they were \u0152 they were awesome, that\u2122s what they were. I remember reading one of Elie Wiesel\u2122s early books, and \u0152 where he talks about the same \u0152 that he had sometimes the same sort of fee ling, that if he looked \u0152 you know, if he could look like them, they wouldn\u2122t hate us so much. So apparently children did have that kind of fantasy. So I do rememb er that. I remember being very afraid. I remember \u0152 you asked me about relationships and so on, I remember my parents Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 67at that point fighting all the time. A lot of tension, a lot of fighting, because the fights were always about what to do and what not to do. And my mother \u0152 my father was a very law abiding sort of straight kind of person, and he thought if he lay low with his Bolivian passports, things would blow over. If he followed whatever directions, or whatever ordinances they passed, and so on, then he would be all right, because you don\u2122t \u0152 you don\u2122t do anything to somebody who\u2122s a law abiding citizen. My mother had totally different ideas. My mother felt that we would never survive if we just stayed th ere, and we have to do something, and there was this constant fighting about who was going to be guilty of us being killed and who wasn\u2122t, and who \u0152 you know, this was [indecipherable] this was, and it was really constant. So I remember th-that part of it. After a few \u0152 after \u0152 we were a year with the Germans in \u0152 in Lw\u00f3w, but after the first two or three months, my parents too \u0152 sent my brot her and me to the country, because by coincidence, the chauffeur that they employed before the war, his wife\u2122s family came from that part of \u0152 of Poland , and they had \u0152 they we re farmers, they had a farm, they were peasants. And so he was able to find that out, he \u0152 or I guess my father did, and they paid them, and then my brother and I st ayed there for about two or three months \u0152"

We couldn\u2122t go out, you did nothin g. You \u0152 you went crazy. Particularly my brother went crazy, because he was a little boy and he was lively.

Nothing, there was nothing. You didn\u2122t do anything. Y ou just \u0152 you just stayed around and listened to what the grown-ups were talking about, and it wasn\u2122t very cheerful, either. No, that was hard. You didn\u2122t go to school, you did nothing, you did absolutely nothing. One memory, vivid me mory I actually have from \u0152 actually this happened before the Germans came, because they \u0152 we were there for two or three months before, and I ha d very, very bad teeth. I s uppose because of the result of this year in Russia and I needed fillings, and those were my permanent teeth, and they were \u0152 had enormous cavities in them, and I \u0152 oh, knitting. My mother taught me how to knit and how to darn, an d I did a lot of that because that was something to do all day long. So I had this knitting needle, and I could put it right through my front teeth, they were s \u0152 and I was supposed to go to the dentist, they had no \u0152 and you know, there were dentists [indecipherable] anyhow, they had no Novocain. So, to do that, they had to strap me to the table and \u0152 to the chair, which was, to this day when I go to a dentist, I have a terrible time. But anyway \u0152 and my parents were having one of their fights about what to do. And I remember staying \u0152 staying in my \u0152 I had like a little alcove where my bed was, and it was early in the morning, and I was supposed to go to the dentist that day, and I remember saysaying to myself whether I should volunteer and say if they stopped fighting, then Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 70I would go without crying and objecting, and I never made it. I was so afraid of this dentist and the strap and the pain, that I didn\u2122t make it. I let them fight on, because I couldn\u2122t bring myself to do that, to make that supreme sacrifice. Anyway, aft \u0152 so then we went out and we were in the country. There I remember digging potatoes, which was great fun, by the way. And then they made fires, and they roasted the potatoes. I remember Christmas there, where we baked a \u0152 there we had something to do. That was, you see, the difference. I didn\u2122t \u0152 we didn\u2122t go out, because they didn\u2122t want us to se e the other farmers, and we didn\u2122t go to church, and we didn\u2122t \u0152 because they all went to church on Sunday, but we didn\u2122t, we were actually hidden. So we only stayed on \u0152 in the field near to their house. And I remember the animals, I remember milking cows, I remember drinking milk straight from the cow. I remember feeding them, I remember the digging of potatoes. So that was actually not \u0152 it was a peaceful kind of interlude, so to speak. And \u0152"

These people didn\u2122t live very long, so \u0152 but anyway, she \u0152 and so my par \u0152 and my parents were hidden in his office behind a wardrobe at the end, it was really \u0152 they couldn\u2122t leave his office, they were like behind a big wardrobe, a partition or something. I wasn\u2122t there, so I don\u2122t know, but my \u0152 but that\u2122s what they told me. And you see, and that\u2122s w hy it was important to get us out of the way, because you couldn\u2122t hide us together like that. And then \u0152 then my par \u0152 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 74you see, my parents at some point realized that they would never survive, or that they would be deported with the Bolivian passport, that the Bolivian passports would not save them from deportations. And you see, there, there was a big difference of opinion between my parents, because my father believed that we would be exchanged, and my mother said no way, this is all \u0152 you know, they\u2122ll never exchange anybody for anybody. And th ey\u2122ll just take us like everybody else, and kill us. So the \u0152 in the end they made the decision that we would go illegally across the border to Hungary. And \u0152 which was a very risky business, but apparently they came to the conclusion that it would be less risky than staying with these Bolivian passports in Lw\u00f3w . My uncle had gone before. He went before because he was \u0152 he didn\u2122t have an y foreign passport, and he was what they dec \u0152 what they designated as a necessary Jew, because he helped \u0152 just like he helped the Russians to identif y what they were robbing, he then did the same for the Germans, because they were \u0152 they were robbing things, and they had these warehouses where they stored them, and they had to decide what to take to Germany, what to send to Germany, what not to send to Germany, what to steal, what not to steal for themselves, and so on, so they ne eded experts to tell them what\u2122s good and what isn\u2122t, you know, lik e in every other area, you know, what is a good painting, what is a good carpet, wh at is good china, what is good silver, what is \u0152 and so on. So my uncle got, since he had that kind of job with the Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 75Russians, he stayed on and they took over this warehouse, and so he stayed with them. And he became \u0152 my uncle was a very charismatic person and became very friendly with the guy who ran this warehous e. And so first he had like a certificate as a notwendig Jude , you know one of these Jews who were necessary for the German Reich. And then he was arrested twice and badly beaten and both times this German was able to get him out on the \u0152 saying that he was a necessary person. But my uncle realized that this is not going to work a third time, besides he suffered terribly, was terribly beaten. And so he decided to \u0152 to take \u0152 to run \u0152 to escape to Hungary , and then we followed. And I remember that crossing of the border, because that was a terrible experien ce, because you see, they kept saying, my parents kept saying \u0152 I guess they \u0152 th ey knew about it and they didn\u2122t try to hide it. Many of these guys, they were paid and then they took people directly to the nearest police outpost. And there was no way you could pretend, I remember being totally, totally defenseless against that, because you were in a forest, and you had to cross \u0152 you didn\u2122t cross on a road, you crossed like on trails. And you had to cross a river, there\u2122s a river on the border of Germany \u0152 of Poland and Hungary. So \u0152 and they were the guides, they \u0152 they were local people who knew how to \u0152 how to get there. And \u0152 but if they turned left or right or straight, and \u0152 and took you somewhere else, there was no way you could have prevented it, or \u0152 or even know. And that\u2122s what happened to many peop le. So I knew about that, Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 76and I \u0152 I don\u2122t know how I knew about it, because probably my parents talked about it and \u0152 and I remember being terribly afraid that they would deliver us. So \u0152 but we didn\u2122t \u0152 they were \u0152 they didn\u2122t , and \u0152 or he didn\u2122t, was one guy. And what I remember about that is that when we were crossing the river, there was a strong sort of current, and there were lik e big rocks and it was slippery, and my father fell, or slipped and lost his gla sses. And that was a major problem, and he got terribly upset because he couldn\u2122t see without his glasses, he was very nearsight. And so I went next to him, or I so rt of went back and I started looking for the glasses and I found them, they we re caught behind the \u0152 and he talked about this as long as he lived, about these \u0152 that I found his glasses and that saved whatever it saved. But the effect of all of this was that we arrived in Hungary near Munk\u00e1cs, and we \u0152 Munk\u00e1cs was the nearest metropolis. And we arrived in the morning early, and we were \u0152 my father was wet, and he was in a suit, and he was wet from the river. And it wasn\u2122t so much that it was uncomfortable, it was in August, so it wasn\u2122t cold, but as \u0152 as they said late \u0152 it was dangerous, you know? Why would these people be dressed like th at and wet and no place to go, in the park. We went to a park, because that was the \u0152 the most logical place to be. And what my father \u0152 what my parents with great bitterness recalled for years and years was that \u0152 see, Hungary had not been occupied yet, and the Hungarian Jews in Munk\u00e1cs \u0152 Munk\u00e1cs was a very Jewish place, they were living there a normal Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 77life, and my parents told \u0152 you know, approached a couple of people, my father did, and told them of \u0152 you know, that we had just escaped from Poland and would they help us. And nobody wanted to help us. Nobody. And it wasn\u2122t even \u0152 that\u2122s what my parent were so bitter about, because it was \u0152 later on, you understood if somebody didn\u2122t he lp you, or the Poles, for that matter, if they didn\u2122t help you during the occupation, because th ey would be severely punished. But at that point in Hungary there was no real danger yet of being severely punished, and yet they wanted no part. And we later \u0152 I read about it later a little, I think they thought if they had nothing to do wi-with us, th en the evil, and all this problem that\u2122s coming from the east, somehow wouldn\u2122t come to them. You know, but my parents were very bitter about it, I don\u2122t know enough about it. But finally somebody did take us in, and I re member that it was on the outskirts, and it was a \u0152 was not a Jewish family, some \u0152 some woman in the square told us to follow her, and she took us, and she had a ba rn. And she told us we could stay in that barn. So we dried out in the barn, and she brought us some food. And in the meantime, my father had some sort of a meeting point with \u0152 because my uncle went ahead, and my uncle was supposed to arrange for Christian papers with a fake name for us. You see, we couldn\u2122t sh ow up as the same people with the same passports in \u0152 in Poland \u0152 in Hungary . You see, we had to then reinvent, and I \u0152 ourselves and the new identity. So th-the idea was that in Hungary we would be Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 78as Polish Christians, which \u0152 of whom there were many because there were some deserters from before the war, from the beginning of the war. And there was a colony of Polish people there. So these papers came to Munk\u00e1cs, and my father got them someplace, and they came with a man with a car, who my uncle arranged would take us to Budapest already with those papers. And those papers, that I ha \u0152 remember one of the most frightening moments of my war was that my mother told us that from now on my name, or \u0152 for me, and my brother too, my name was, since I was always called Ria(ph), that my name was Maria, and the last name was Wolinsky(ph). Our name before the war was Wohl. So the simplest thing, they dropped the H and made it into a very nice Polish name, which was Wolinsky(ph), so my name was Maria Wolinsky (ph), or Wolinska (ph) for that matter. And my brother was Stefan always, so there was no problem, was Stefan Wolinsky(ph) and my father was Athol(ph) and my mother was Gisele. But, when we were \u0152 you see, the \u0152 Munk\u00e1cs in that area was still the border, it was the border strip what they called, and then th ere was a post, a police post that you had to pass. And there they stopped all the cars and looked and \u0152 and you had to identify yourself, or whatever, identification. And at that point, when they stopped us, my mind went blank. I suddenly co uld not remember whether our name now was Wolinsky(ph) or Wolsky(ph), which are very similar. And I was \u0152 and how I didn\u2122t die of a heart attack, although children don\u2122t usually, but I was trembling Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 79and I was petrified. And this guard spoke to the driver, of course and the driver \u0152 they spoke Hungarian, we couldn\u2122t unde rstand a word. And they \u0152 he told them that we were some relatives or something. I mean, it never came to us \u0152 to our having \u0152 it was all bribe \u0152 the \u0152 to identify ourselves, but I thought that it might, and I was sure that they would ask me my name, this was very important at that point, and I was very scared. And as soon as we started moving again, I said to my mother, I forgot what our name is. And she \u0152 and I was \u0152 you know, I \u0152 I saw myself also as being the \u0152 the one who caused everyone to be whatever \u0152 so, killed or \u0152 or whatever. So my mother said then , don\u2122t worry, she said, if you \u0152 if they had asked you for your name, we would have been lost anyway, no matter what they would have s \u0152 what th ey would have \u0152 what you would have said. So \u0152 but it was just, to show you how these things were. So then we came to Budapest and in Budapest we stayed in a pensionne. And we could not stay in the city, it was sort of in the outskirts of the city, but life was good. You had plenty of food, we had comfortable rooms. Apparently life was enormously cheap in Hungary at that time. And my father went to the city quite often, I remember, came back and then once he was \u0152 you see, the \u0152 the \u0152 the Hungarians were allies of the Germans. Gonna stop it.

And this baby squirrel, we had had him now maybe for a coupl e of months when \u0152 when we got arrested. And he was tame, he was \u0152 he would sit in pe ople\u2122s pockets. He was quite destructive actually, he would chew things up. But of course, my brother absolutely adored this squirrel, and to this day he loves s quirrels, and I do too. And when my father \u0152 when they arrested us, my \u0152 they did go back with my father a day or two later, and \u0152 to pick up some thin gs, you know, the necessities, and so they \u0152 they went back with my father and he was supposed to pick up some things for us. And at that point the squirrel apparently recogniz ed him and came to him and jumped into his pocket as he always did. And there he was, and this policeman had never seen a squirrel like that. And so he s \u0152 you know, the squirrel came back to prison, and he was there. And when we got \u0152 when he got there, we didn\u2122t know what to do with him, cause you couldn\u2122t keep him in the pocket all the time. So we let him go in the courtyard, and he went up and down that tree. He became like \u0152 everybody loved him. And luckily, we were released a few days later and the squirrel went home with us. But one of the other sort of more humorous thing \u0152 they \u0152 they Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 83examined our papers and decided it wa s okay. But one of the more humorous things from that was that when they interrogated you, you had these false papers, but you had to have \u0152 you know, they could ask you what was your mother\u2122s maiden name, what was your grandmother\u2122s maiden name, and so on. So people of course, and we weren\u2122t the only ones who were in that situation, didn\u2122t have all that information, nor did they \u0152 so they invented these names, and my mother used to tol \u0152 told a very funny story of this woman who was interro \u0152 who was asked, you know, interrogated, and when she was asked, she would look around and pick an object, and say, you know, tay-tabloska (ph), you know, and just add the Polish ending to it, you\u2122d look around. So that \u2122s how things were , you know, and \u0152 and you either got away with it, or you didn\u2122 t get away with it, depended. But anyway, so then we were there for another \u0152 must have been there about 10 days, and then they released it."

And no, I was not mem \u0152 we also were taught very carefully by my mother, who knew those things, because she had been educated in Catholic schools, we were taught the basic Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 84prayers, you know, th-the Holy Mary, th e \u0152 and Father, who are in heaven, the \u0152 the Pater Noster, because as Christian children we obviously had to know these main things. So those things we knew backwards and forwards in \u0152 in Polish, quite, quite well. We were not questioned about that. So then they released us and we went back to this place, but they told us that we couldn\u2122t stay there, because it was too close to Budapest. And they had, at that tim e they had some rules about Polish refugees in general. This was not directed against Jews. They did not want large concentrations of foreign refugees in Budapest , say they wanted them outside of Budapest in smaller villages and ar \u0152 and so on, areas. So at that point \u0152 by the way, the squirrel, after he came back about a week later, he grew, he became \u0152 a-and he left, he ran away. Probably went back to the forest, once he was no longer a baby, he was gone. And my brother was very upset when he \u0152 but \u0152 but he came back from prison, then he left. And then we \u0152 so then we had to move, and we moved to an area that was \u0152 th at they told us they \u0152 that we should be in, and it was not far from Budapest, about an hour by train in Le\u00e1nyfalu , and that was sort of a concentration of Polish refugees. We rented a villa. We could do that, we did \u0152 you know, within the circumference of where they wanted to \u0152 we could live the way we wanted to live. Th e only problem with that was that we were surrounded by Poles, and many of th em not Jews. Some were Jews like us and some were not. More were not. And there the theater started. You really had to Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 85know how to pretend not to be Jewish. And these Polish people, they knew. I mean, this was \u0152 this was all a \u0152 a theater. So there \u0152 first of all, we had a fairly normal life in the sense that we were not hiding, so my mother decided to see if she could find somebody to take care of my brother and of me, and teach us something. I mean, you \u0152 we had never been to school ag ain. And they \u0152 we were driving them also crazy. So we \u0152 they took a \u0152 they found a lady who had been a teacher before the war, and she was the wife of a \u0152 of a \u0152 she was Polish, not Jewish, and she was the wife, a young wife of a Polish deserter. Most of these Poles were actually somehow families of deserters. You know, they deserted in 1939 from this army that was falling apart. And he was a tenor at the \u0152 at the opera in Poznan a Polish singer, and she was a teac her. And she was just as happy to work for us because she was paid, of co urse. And she would come in the morning and she would take care of us all day long. And I \u0152 that was a \u0152 very nice, because she would take us on picnics. She did find some Polish books. She made up a schedule, you know, we read, and then she had dictation, and then she had arithmetic, and then she had lunch and \u0152 an d we were with her all day long, and she invented \u0152 she even \u0152 we even staged a little \u0152 I think one of the pictures that \u0152 that I showed you that you took was a st aging of a Polish song in honor of my uncle\u2122s birthday and so on."

Another thing that I often \u0152 that I know was very highly emphasized to us, and I still feel very strongly about this, is that we had to speak Polish correctly. We were not allowed \u0152 my mother would have killed us if we had used a Jewish word, I mean that was a giveaway. So you were sort of brainwashed to speak it, to speak it correctly and speak it without an intonation and so on. Because those were giveaways. So to this day, when \u0152 when I hear \u0152 hear people mixing, you know, Yi ddish and English, I \u0152 I can\u2122t stand it. Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 88First of all, I don\u2122t think it\u2122s nice, because every language should be \u0152 I have nothing against Yiddish, but by itself, it shouldn\u2122t be mixed, you don\u2122t mix languages. Now there it was a matter of life and death, so you had to speak Polish correctly, and that was s-something that was another reason why my mother was very anxious to hire somebody to \u0152 to \u0152 to be with us, though, because children pick up accents, and that we should speak properly. So, we went to church every Sunday. How did I feel? I had one problem with it, and that was a very strange one. That the incense, I hated the smell of it, and I must have just about gotten to the age just before puberty, and I used to get terrible headaches. And \u0152 which I suffered from for a while.

What, they went to the Hungarians, the Hungarians didn\u2122t know who was who, they were not that interested in the whole thing. But here now, we were afraid of that.

So, no, there was no conversation, looked at our paper and waved us on and th at was it. Then we went home.

And my parents stayed with somebody, but I have no idea with whom. And during the ne xt few weeks, two or three or four weeks, whatever that time period was, they made arrangements to \u0152 to try to cross the border illegally, to Romania. In other words, we tried to do the same thing we did from Poland to Hungary , now from Hungary to Romania . Romania , things were much easier, as you know.

And he, I don\u2122t know how he did it, but he got this fake \u0152 I showed you that picture, I think \u0152 he got this fake permit for a wife and a child, and my mother was supposed to go as his wife, and Stefan, my brother was Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 94supposed to go as their child. But that never materialized. That\u2122s why there is this funny photo, passport photo of my uncle, my mother and \u0152 and my brother. That never materialized. But then, after the Germans came, and we were hiding for a bit, we tried to go to Romania. And the way that happened was we went to Szeged, and there there was a line-up. There was a house owned by some people who rented the rooms. You paid them. And that was just renting rooms. But then there was an aristocrat or a landowner who was \u0152 whose property was right on the border, and th-the \u0152 the way was through his property. And he was a kind of bon vivant before the war, or during the beginning of the war, and he had a lot of parties. So he wasn\u2122t conspicuous by having 10, 12 people at his estate at any one time. So people \u0152 so the first place where you stayed was a \u0152 at \u0152 in Szeged , and then you went at night to his property, a nd then you stayed there for one day, and there was this pretense of a party. And then at night you crossed the border to Romania. And the party before us was caught. Somebody must have announced, and they were all killed, by the way. So he was \u0152 they were caught, and somebody \u0152 and they came to get us, because somebody \u0152 they were tortured, and they gave out the address of where people \u0152 they knew that this was like a chain. My uncle, luckily, was not home when they came to arrest us. We were there, he was out on \u0152 in town, because he was supposed to go with us that evening, but he went out on Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 95town. He was a \u0152 that was one of these strokes of genius. And he \u0152 and we were arrested, and they took us to the local jail in Szeged ."

You \u0152 this was a local prison, you know, you had these \u0152 and it was a miserable little jail, and the conditions were terrible, and there I was sure that we wouldn\u2122t survive. I was terrified, because I knew that if they arrested us, and these people there gave our names, that the next thing would be that they \u0152 that the police, th-the Hungarian police would hand us over to the Gestapo, there was no \u0152 I didn\u2122t think there was any other way out of this.

I \u0152 that the day before there was \u0152 we were ther e six days \u0152 the day before they were supposed to come, they released us, and in the cust ody of a local lawyer, a Hungarian lawyer who was born and bred in Szeged . Now the way this was done is very interesting, it shows you how resourceful my uncle was. When my uncle came back and realized we had been taken \u0152 by the way, my mother left money and jewelry behind one of the pictures. Th ey had a \u0152 they had a \u0152 a secret as to how, you know \u0152 anyhow [indecipherable] he got that, and he went back to Budapest, by foot, by hitchhike, I don\u2122t even know how, but he did go back, because his papers were not so [indecipherable] either. But he was loner man, he was very resourceful. And he went to the Polish committee, there was a Polish committee, which was in charge of Polish refugees in Hungary . It was like a \u0152 a committee. And he kne w a number of people; my uncle was very friendly with a number of non-Jews from before the war. He knew people in \u0152 and all the time, he was in touch with them. And he told them what happened to us. And basically, they figured out that the only transgression that we did, for all practical purposes, was that my father was not supposed to be in Szeged, because we, as Polish refugees were \u0152 we had designated areas where we were supposed to live, and Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 97Szeged was not one of them. So they invented this idea that he went to look for work. And that was a very nice idea, but then they looked for a connection and they found the most prominent lawyer in Szeged , paid him off. He paid off the \u0152 I mean, this \u0152 the \u0152 the girl was his regul ar, you know, where he \u0152 where he was well known, and where he had his cronies. So that\u2122s how we got out. So we were actually \u0152 and this lawyer, also a wonde rful man, took us to his house, and you know, really treated us \u0152 he was a Hungarian \u0152 very well. I mean, he fed us, I remember we took a bath there, everything was \u0152"

So anyhow, she said the confession went very well, but she always told it as a very amusing story, how he after that started improving. And he \u0152 so he was in this hospital for a few weeks, and she was with him. She \u0152 you know, they very often let relatives stay in European ho spitals, it\u2122s still common in Brazil , even. But anyway, after that \u0152 and we were hidden \u0152 not hidden, but living with this woman, hidden in a way, because we couldn\u2122t go out. And then later, my uncle placed us with the janitor of a villa which was owned by Jewish antique dealer, who had been a contact of my unc les before the war. It was now occupied by a Dutch \u0152 I don\u2122t know, official, or somebody who was doing a lot of business with the Germans. And my uncle met him because he knew both the janitor and the previous owner. The previous owner, by the way, survived in one of those Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 101Jewish houses in \u0152 in Budapest, he was not deported, he did survive. And so my uncle placed us in this villa, it was in Buda, right on top of a mountain, near a cemetery, I remember, with this janitor and his wife. So we were there. My parents, when they returned from Szeged from the hospital, stayed with some friends or some peop le they knew in Budapest . This was already now getting close to the end, and confusion was rampan t. This was already \u0152 the Russians were very close."

My brother was \u0152 I always thought \u0152 my \u0152 my father, you see, my fath \u0152 my mother was his second wife, and he was not young. My father was born in 1887, so when my brother was born, he was close to 50. So my father had very little \u0152 and he was a very autocratic kind of authoritarian person. He had very little understanding, knowledge or anything about children. Children were supposed to be quiet and obey. And my brother was lively, had nothing to do \u0152 I mean we \u0152 we had nothing to do, it\u2122s very \u0152 now I see how difficult it was, but as a result of it, he was a terrible nuisance. He \u0152 he \u0152 my father was constantly yelling at him, my uncle often used to beat him up, he was beaten very often. He was a terrible nui sance, because he \u0152 he couldn\u2122t just behave. And I, as a child, or \u0152 I was onl y a year and a half older, I was very mature, and I was very quiet. So I was no problem. My mother taught me how to Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 102darn, my mother taught me how to knit. Later on I knew how to read, so I used to read \u0152 not appropriate things, because she \u0152 whatever Polish book she had, I could sit there and decipher it, whether I liked the story or not, because that was something to do. I did all kinds of word games and so on. My brother wasn\u2122t interested in any of that, and he didn\u2122t do any of that. So he really \u0152 I don\u2122t remember what he did except make a terrible nuisance of himself. So \u0152 and I always, whenever they f \u0152 they also fought about him, because my mother protected him, my father got angry at him, my mother protected him. So he was a problem, and I always thought that he was the problem, I didn\u2122t know, nor did I understand that the circumstances were the problem, and he was just a naturally \u0152 a normal child who was in terrible conditions."

I don\u2122t know \u0152 we both were afraid at \u0152 as a matter of fact, I told you that I did an oral history in Brazil in Portuguese, and I have those tapes, but because of my brother, because he did one over there and they were \u0152 they had a program on Jewi sh refugees a few years ago, and the \u0152 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 103the focus was, what do people take when they\u2122re running away, do they take their pictures, do they take jewelry, do they take medals? I mean, depending, different people took different things. But that was the focus, and with that they had a few oral histories. And it is amazing how different his perception was of what happened. How he was afraid \u0152 the basic f acts are the same, but like he was afraid at different times, he remembers different moments as being the worst or the best, and \u0152 from me. And we were only a year and a half apart, so \u0152 but I do know that he was a problem. He was a problem becau se he \u0152 he had \u0152 he was a problem; made noise, got on people\u2122s nerves, because he was bored. So I \u0152 you know, I tolerated \u0152 I \u0152 I identified with the grownups and the people who knew that \u0152 that you had to behave. And \u0152 and \u0152 and he \u0152 and I saw him the same way, unfortunately, I\u2122ve \u0152 today I\u2122m sorry about it, as my father did, that he was a nuisance and he didn\u2122t know how to behave and he didn\u2122t know that he had to be quiet. So, I did not identify with him, nor with his problems. I didn\u2122t identify with his problems til many years la ter, when I had my own children and I realized that children \u0152 what children really need and so on. But during the war he was a pain in the neck, he really was. And, I think we\u2122ll stop here, because otherwise I\u2122ll be very late."

He was first in the hospital, then he stayed for as long as they could in the house of the lawyer who was able to get us out of jail. He was a lawyer who was quite prominent in Szeged , had a large apartment, because I remember it, because that\u2122s where went directly from prison, we went to his apartment, and we stayed there a day or two before my brother and I left for Budapest, and he \u0152 and my father went to \u0152 got sick and stayed on and ended up in the hospital. Now we are in Buda at the janitor of a friend of my uncle\u2122s \u0152 oh, not a friend really, but an acquaintance who was in the same business as my Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 105uncle, he was a art dealer in Budapest, and he had a villa in Buda where he lived, and on the property he had a caretaker a nd his wife. It was a small house on the property, separate. And that\u2122s where my uncle placed us. And that\u2122s where we were living, and it wasn\u2122t bad there, it was fine. I mean, they fed us and they were quite nice to us, we were not supposed to be running around too much, although we could go into the garden, but we were not going out too much. And my uncle would come and visit us quite often. Eventu ally, my parents came back to Budapest, and we did not see them, at least I don\u2122t remember seeing them. And I think they stayed somewhere, with someone for a very short time, because then my father got sick again. And he went to the hospital, and from what I understand, he was operated \u0152 he had gall bladder problems, that \u0152 that was his u \u0152 these various stays in the hospital ha \u0152 were gall bladder attacks. An d I think he was oper \u0152 not only I think, I know, he was operated by a surgeon as th \u0152 people called them then a professor something, pr \u0152 I don\u2122t remember his name. And the surgeon realized that they were \u0152 who they were, or what they were and he decided to help them, I presume. And he kept my father in the hospital beyond \u0152 beyond what was necessary. Today you can\u2122t do that, but then you di d. And he was a prominent \u0152 he was prominent in this hospital, and my parents had a private room , and my mother stayed with him, which was very common in those days. And he \u0152 they were liberated in the hospital. So for Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 106them this was a marvelous thing, because he just kept him on and on. And he wasn\u2122t terribly well, he was weak, he was after surgery, so there was some justification in that. But anyhow, that\u2122s where they were liberated. We, on the other side \u0152 on the other hand were in Buda in \u0152 with this janitor, and my uncle was the one who kept coming to us and visiting us. And \u0152 and yo \u0152 sort of looking after us. And while this was going on, of course the front was getting closer and closer, the Russians were coming closer and closer, and Budapest was encircled. So the siege of Budapest was about, I think, five or six weeks, it was quite long."

Then we went \u0152 so anyway, then we came back, and by that time we no longer stayed in the \u0152 in the caretaker\u2122s house, because by that time the Germans were really on the run, and there was less danger of being arrested or something by the Germans. They were not so much on the run as they were occupied by other thin gs. They were fighting. And we moved into the main house, and my uncle was able to get the old couple, who were actually the antique dealer and his wife, they were in a \u0152 what they called it \u0152 they were hidden someplace in Buda \u0152 in \u0152 in Pest, I think. I don\u2122t know exactly, but my uncle was able to get them out to wherever they were, and helped them come to our \u0152 come to their \u0152 what was their home, what was their house, and they prepared the cellar. And we were all in the cellar of the villa, because that was safer. Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 115It was a real cellar, so it was more like a shelter. And that\u2122s where we were. So it was the old couple, my uncle and the two of us, and the caretaker and his wife would come in there and stay for a while and then go back to their house. They were in and out, I remember. There was a Dutch man \u0152 by the way, that\u2122s how we were actually able to stay with the caretaker. There was a Dutch man, I think \u0152 well, this will make a lot of sense, I think it was Menton(ph). Menton(ph) is a very wellknown name because there was a book written about him, and then my uncle, after the war, was in a very controversial situation with him. Menton(ph) lived, or his friend, lived in the villa, and that\u2122s how we were able to stay with the caretaker, and there was no suspic \u0152 I mean, nobody looked at who we were and what we were. And so \u0152 but by then, Menton(ph) had fled, because he was obviously friendly with the Germans, and he was afraid and I think if he went to Holland \u0152 he \u0152 he was gone and the villa was empty. So the rightful owners came back, they were very old. As a matter of fact, she died during the siege. And \u0152 and then \u0152 and we all stayed in the shelter of that \u0152 or in the \u0152 what was the shelter, but what was n-not really a shelter, it was just the cellar of the villa .

And I al ways wore it, of course, and that watch I liked a lot. And then when the Russians did occupy us \u0152 I\u2122ll go back to that, but one of the things that I remember vividly is that my uncle realized \u0152 I didn\u2122t know about it, but he knew that they were raping women, and they were actually no \u0152 not a very kind liberators, but \u0152 and it was rou gh, and he wanted to protect me, so he told me that \u0152 they also used to be crazy about watches, they took watches by the dozen and they would line them up on thei r arms, and \u0152 from the wrist up, and they \u0152 that was sort of like their status symbol as \u0152 as to how many th ey could get.

So the big danger was that they would do that. So every time we heard steps on top, I went under the bed with my watch and \u0152 bed, it was a kind of cot, and my uncle would run up the steps and scream in Russian, you know, the \u0152 we \u0152 there are just children here, and we are friends and so on.

No, because he was equally as upset as \u0152 you know, it was Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 123equally ha \u0152 people in tho \u0152 at least my \u0152 my experience was that except for my mother occasionally, when they were \u0152 when we were in jail, and things were sort of static, this was not static, you had to move. It\u2122s like \u0152 it\u2122s like comforting a child who got up on top of a hill and doesn\u2122t know how to ski down.

There was \u0152 you had to move, you had to \u0152 you had to walk, and it was at night, and it was dark, and it was hard. But he \u0152 I guess he pushed us. He \u0152 I don\u2122t know what he did, I don\u2122t remember, but all I rememb er is that that was a very difficult, miserable walk. And then we got to their house, and they had been liberated for a few days also, and they were still in the cellar, because most people s \u0152 remained there. There was no pl \u0152 mu \u0152 many of the houses on top were destroyed. Or it was freezing cold, it was warmer in the cellar. So they were down below, and there was hardly any room for us, but somehow we \u0152 of course, we had to stay there, so we stayed there. But the worst thing was that during the night, the Germans broke out from the castle, and it was \u0152 that was the last \u0152 they were encircled and that was the last time they broke out and that they made any stand, and that they re-occupied our house. And that was terrible. And they took out all the men in our cellar and they \u0152 at \u0152 these were people that my uncle kne w and I don\u2122t remember who they were. All Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 124I remember is that they went \u0152 they made all the men go upstairs and they killed three of them while we were there. Now, how my uncle escaped being killed, I don\u2122t remember. I don\u2122t think he went up with them. They said, all the inhabitants in this house have to come upstairs \u0152 all the men. And so they did, and they killed them. This was in the last minute, we were only occupied for another few hours. And then the Russians advanced, and the Germans \u0152 you know, it was like a last desperate attempt on their part, and it was horrible that we ha \u0152 we were there. And \u0152"

And then we were re-occupied by the Russians, and we didn\u2122t stay after that, we just went as far as the Danube. We tried to cross over and my uncle \u0152 by then I remember he sort of used us, my brother and me, you kno w. Here we were these children, and the parents were on the other side and so on. So because there was a har \u0152 a priority for people crossing, there was a pontoon bridge by then. And they didn\u2122t want civilians crossing back and forth, I mean, this was still wartime.

And what we had to do was go from boat to boat, because this was a pontoon bridge, and they needed people to get the water out of these little boats, because these boats kept leaking, and they were filling up with water. So it took us hours and hours, because we were going from one boat to the next, slowly crossing that bridge and he lping get the water out of the boats. And then the next dramatic thing was that we go to Buda and we went straight to the hospital, and they had on the gate, they ha d a list of people who had survived, and my parents were not on it. And then I remember we got a terrible shock and started screaming and yelling. And it turned out th at the reason there \u0152 they had survived, the reason the list \u0152 they were not on that list was because the list was of people who were still there, who had survived were \u0152 and were in the hospital.

But don\u2122t forget that the Russians and the chaos that was right after liberation. It was not paradise. It was far from it. You didn\u2122t know whether the Russians wouldn\u2122t grab you. Russians also did things that \u0152 unexpected things. They either arrested you, or they decided you were a capitalist. I mean, we had experience with the Russians, we had been with them. So we knew what they were like. So it wasn\u2122t like it was paradise, plus the physical conditions, which were so bad. And the cold, it was the middle of winter, was January. So it wasn\u2122t like you know, now you\u2122re free, and you begin to live. As a matter of fact, to digress a little, I understand there\u2122s a new documentary called \ufb01The Last Days,\ufb02 which I understand deals a lot with the aftermath, what happens right after. Because it wasn\u2122t that simple, it didn\u2122t just end and then everything was fine. There were decisions to be made, where to go, what to do. I also remember that when you \u0152 that Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 130I felt that when you only surv ive \u0152 when your goal is to survive, you have more of a direction than after the war, when you \u0152 when it\u2122s no long er just to survive, but where to go, how to survive, what to do with your life. When you\u2122re only trying to save your life, your \u0152 your way of thinking is very, ve ry different. So I almost remember a certain, like a lack of direction, like a certain, you know, let down almost. It\u2122s like \u0152 it\u2122s like after a party. You look forward to it like I don\u2122t know what, and then afterwards you sort of, where do you go from here ? That\u2122s the kind of thing I remember. And also the discussions; where to go, what to do. So finally they decided to go to the south of Hungary. And for me, at that point also was a very big disappointment, be cause my uncle, whom I worshipped, decided that he was done with us. He \u0152 he knew his fa mily had survived. They had gone from Siberia to Palestine. He had \u0152 he had a goal, he was going to Palestine to be reunited with his family. So he, at that point, decided to leave us. And he was going to go to Romania, and from Romania I think there were boats already going to Palestine somehow. And I wanted to go with him. I didn\u2122t \u0152 I really wanted to go with him. I would have gone with him to the end of the world. And that I remember as being very traumatic, and he talked to me and told me that I couldn\u2122t go with him because I wasn\u2122t his child, and he had his own children and all of that was very hard for me to take. And also, I felt that he had more direction, he knew what he was Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 131going to do, while my father did not. And so of course, he left and I felt very abandoned, very abandoned. And not only I, but our whol e, family, because he was the resourceful one. And while my father di \u0152 was a wonderful man, but it \u0152 for peace time. He was not very good during the war. I mean, for \u0152 for these very difficult conditions. Not difficult, where you really couldn\u2122t just go a straight line, my father was a straight, very straight pe rson. So anyway, my father da \u0152 so we went south, and I don\u2122t remember how we traveled. I think \u0152 I don\u2122t remember, you know, all I remember is that in the south of Hungary , we stayed on a farm with some people, and \u0152 Hungarians. And it was wonderful, because it was \u0152 it was spring by then. And we stayed there through the spring, and it \u0152 I think through the spring. Maybe for \u0152 for a month or six week s. And there were animals. I remember I learned how to cut the wool off \u0152 they ha d angora rabbits, and so they taught me how to do that. That\u2122s sort of nice, and th en how to weave. I could weave yarn. They had a spindle, or whatever it\u2122s called, and I could weave angora into wool; I was very good. Anything with my hands, I was very good at. And actually I had my first romance there, there was a boy of 17 or 16 , he was much ol \u0152 and he was on the neighboring farm, and I learned how to ride a bike at that point, because he taught me how to ride a bike. And there was a little river where we used to go and walk along and look at pebbles, and do things. So that was ve ry nice there. During that Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 132time my father went back to Poland, to Krak\u00f3w , because he thought that he would be able to go back there and resume life there. He did not want to go to Palestine, he was never a Zionist, and he also knew that conditions in Palestine were very bad. And he was a banker, and I remember he even \u0152 I remember his words. He used to say that the German bankers, there were many German bankers, much more prominent, who had gone there in the 30s and were still walking around with a cane. You know, with a little walking stick, because they had nothing to do, and \u0152 and so he felt that he couldn\u2122t \u0152 wouldn\u2122t want to go there, he couldn\u2122t make a living there. He could also not even contribute anything to the country, because he didn\u2122t have a \u0152 that kind of a skill. So Palestine was out. He thought that he could go back to Poland . The reason he thought he could go back to Poland is because there was a government in exile in \u0152 in London , headed by Mikolajczyk was his name, and my father thought that it was going to be a democratic Poland , and he thought he could repossess whatever he had, and start life again. He was robbed on the train going there. He got to Krak\u00f3w and he saw the Russians had occupied Poland, and [indecipherable] but of course, conditions were much better already. But he saw that there was no one to talk to, that that \u0152 no one was \u0152 you know, he would have to deal with the Russians. Anyhow, he came to the conclusion he couldn\u2122t do it. So he came back to \u0152 to Mak\u00f3 and he decided that we should go to Vienna, which was Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 133actually, in the long run, a good decision, because he had a great deal of property in Vienna. Vienna had just been liberated, and Vienna was in four occupational zones. And he would establish the fact th at he survived, claim whatever he had claims on, and he thought maybe there. So that I remember, we went back to Budapest and from Budapest we took a train. And by then there was a train going, but there were like millions of people on the station, everybody had bundles and it was cold and it \u0152 it was horrible. It was really quite difficult."

What I do remember is that I, for the first time, I found about Jewish things, because my grandfather ate kosher, and so did my aunt. And I remember that when I get \u0152 got back from Vienna, my mother showed me, there was this one shelf of a few cups and things, and she told me not to touch t hose, because those we re my grandfather\u2122s dishes and I wasn\u2122t supposed to touch them.

But I wasn\u2122t very impressed, because again, by then it was a little cleaned up already, and it \u0152 while it was very destroyed, I was not exactly at an age where I could appreciate it, that these wonderful buildings were destroyed. And it was nothing compared with what Budapest looked like. I mean, I knew what the city that\u2122s destroyed is a few hours Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 146after, that\u2122s very different. So I wasn\u2122t \u0152 that didn\u2122t make any impression on me. As far as Jewish memorials, we never went to any of them. My parents \u0152 you know, as far as the ghetto, or the site of the ghetto and so on. No, I think this is an [indecipherable] that is now very \u0152 you know, people do it and I\u2122m going to say something that\u2122s going to shoc k everybody, but I think that \u0152 I myself feel that there\u2122s \u0152 when we really needed help and support righ t after the war, and when I came to Brazil and \u0152 and, you know, I had a need to talk abou t what happened to us, in order to inform people I had close c ontact with, schoolmates and so on, nobody was interested. Nobody was interested. And now, I almost think it\u2122s too much, and I myself am almost overdosed on the Holocaus t, particularly on the superficial de \u0152 characteristics of it. I still very much like to read books on the ho \u0152 that have something to do with the Holocaust. No t memor \u0152 not memoirs, you know, what happened to another person who had a simi lar story like mine, I think on that level it\u2122s not interesting. But novels or fiction or anything that deals with the Holocaust, I will read, and I find some of them very interesting. But this sort of obsession with it now is, I think way overboard, you know, way, way too much. And not all of it\u2122s sincere anyway. So anyhow, we did \u0152 I don\u2122t remember doing anything Jewish. After the war, my mother was very gratified, because my parents did ask us after the war whether we wanted to stay Jewish. A nd both my brother and I apparently said Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 147yes. I don\u2122t remember it v \u0152 I do remember talking about it, but it wasn\u2122t a long discussion, it was more \u0152 don\u2122t forget, we had these Christian papers. We had an option to stay who we were during the wa r. You \u0152 you did have some \u0152 you had a possibility, and some people did. They just didn\u2122t want to have anything to do with it any more. They didn\u2122t want their children to have to go through this, what we went through, and so there were all kinds of different solutions, let\u2122s say, or \u0152 or \u0152 or roads to recovery that people opted for. Options. So I \u0152 they asked us, and we decided that we wanted to \u0152 at least we sa id that we wanted to stay Jewish, and the reason was not \u0152 I was too young, I mean I didn\u2122t know anything, I never studied anything, neither did my brother, that I-I just felt that \u0152 that we were born, that is like, do I want to be a blonde? No, because I was never a blonde, and there was no reason to now become a blonde. So now that it\u2122s over, yes, so we said yes. But it wasn\u2122t such a big deal as it is today in general again, you know being Jewish was not what I always tell my husband, a full-tim e occupation. It was just something you were, that\u2122s all. So, after the war, we had back our names and our \u0152 you know, legitimate birth certificates and the whole thing. And we went via \u0152 we went to Sweden. In Sweden \u0152 we went by train, I think \u0152 in Sweden we had to wait a long time, we were in Stockholm for about three months. We didn\u2122t get to Brazil til October, so we must have been there \u0152 not three months, maybe a little shorter, Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 148because the trip took about four or five weeks on the \u0152 on a freighter.

Now Brazil was the goal and Sweden was certainly a good and easy country to \u0152 to wait in. And that\u2122s what happened. We waited in Sweden in \u0152 in Stockholm we stayed in \u0152 in zak \u0152 some sort of a pensionne, boarding house, very comfortable.

But in addition to that, he financed the \u0152 his cousins representation of Omega and Tissot, which were two very well-known makes of Swiss watches. And my \u0152 my father\u2122s cousin had the representation of these two brands for Poland. Omega particularly was very successful before the war, and my father was \u0152 had a partner [indecipherable] finance his cousin, or whatever. So anyhow , he had connections, and his idea was to go to Brazil , and with the capital from Mr. Landau(ph), with his help, which was more like he owed my father wha \u0152 he \u0152 they \u0152 my father would open a representation and import of Swiss watches. And that actually was his business, and he went to \u0152 to Switzerland in order to talk \u0152 to see \u0152 t-to develop some relationships with manufacturers. And so he went for about two or three weeks. And in Sweden there wasn\u2122t much going on, becaus e we were just waiting for passage and \u0152 and he knew that we we ren\u2122t getting it so soon, there were, as I said before, thousands of people waiting for passage out of the \u0152"

There was no abortion in \u0152 in Sweden, which I \u0152 it was a surprise to me, a progressive country like that, you couldn\u2122t get an abortio n.

And \u0152 but I had no clue as to why. And then she induced the miscarriage. So I remember there was a lot of blood and she told me that was a very heavy menstruation. I was the one that was cleaning it up. So that was not a happy thing, but I didn\u2122t know that it was that until many years later. And then she recovered and we waited, and my father came back, eventually, we went to G\u00f6teborg .

I knew that Rio, its capital, and that\u2122s where we were going, was supposed to be a beautiful city. And also I knew that we knew a number of people there; that I knew. And also my father, not only that \u0152 that his former pa rtner was there, but also my father was married before, so my mother was his sec ond wife, and he had two daughters by his first wife, and the older one, with her husband and son, were in Brazil ; that was another reason why we went there. And my nephew, her son, was only two and a half years younger than I am, and a year younger than my brother. So I knew that \u0152 that there was some sort of family. My father never had a very good relationship with her before or after the war, but that\u2122s a different story. But anyhow, I knew they were there. And what did it mean? It meant a certain, imagine, permanence, but not a happy one. Not \u0152 not for me. I had \u0152 I ha d \u0152 I was open to it, but my mother was very unhappy, she didn\u2122t want to go to Brazil , so there was a lot of problems for \u0152 about that, because my mother really wanted to go to Palestine . And she made it very clear when my uncle left, she wanted to do it. My father didn\u2122t want to take the Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 155chance, and of course, she couldn\u2122t do it. But she felt that Brazil was really a very, very, very, you know, contrary , different country, and she felt very strongly that she had nothing in common with that culture, and talked a lot about it. I remember that I, for myself, felt that she was exaggerating, that she was making it \u0152 being negative, and I didn\u2122t want to be negative at that poi nt. My father also \u0152 my father was a very positive, but my father was the kind of man who, how shall I say?

It was a strange country, a tropical country, she kept saying it was a tropical country, a strange country, and it really ma de no sense to go there, and she was very unhappy about it. And when they argued abou t it, th-the interesting thing was that she used to say that my brother, who wa s much more \u0152 you know, was younger and much more sort of very different, less settled than I was at that \u0152 you \u0152 she used to warn my father and say, you na \u0152 he\u2122s going to get used to this country, and you see, he\u2122ll end up marrying out of faith.

The only place that was air conditioned were cinemas. So my mother used to say, we go to the ci \u0152 to the movies for the climate.

And so my mother used to say, when you want to go into the bathroom, you have to knock first, not to see if somebody\u2122s there, but to frighten them away. And that\u2122s exactly what I [indecipherable] . And that was horrible, that was just awful. It was a horrible place, th \u0152 and it wasn\u2122t \u0152 it was in the best part of town, it wasn\u2122t like it was the slums or anything. But that \u0152 those were the conditions in Brazil . It was not a super luxury hotel, it was a \u0152 some sort of middle class kind of residential hotel.

So anyway, during that dinner, of course, the conversation was about what we went through, you know, what happened wi \u0152 to us during the war and so on.

            "answer": "I should really backtrack and tell you about my school experience, because I arrived in Brazil at the age of 14, and basically had no school, because I was in school about 10 months in Siberia , in first grade. I was in school after that again, after the war, in Vienna for about six weeks or two months. I was taught by this lady, this Polish lady in Hungary , and by my mother, so I la \u0152 that\u2122s how, at some point I learned how to read and write. Probably in first grade, but that was in Russian. And just before they deported us, I was in school for about two months or so, because I remember making lines and lines and lines of As and Bs, that\u2122s how they taught at that time. So that was in Polish. So basically I had never really been in Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 161school properly. So here I was, and I was 14 years old, and I needed to go to school. So my parents found out, and I found out that the Brazilian system is exactly like the French system. Which means th at you have to \u0152 they can not put you any higher than sixth grade, because you don\u2122t earn credits , you have to work towards the baccal \u0152 baccalaureate, or wa \u0152 how you spell it, how you pronounce it, and they wouldn\u2122t take me above the sixth grade. They were willing to take me into the sixth grade, and then I would learn Portuguese, and so on. So anyway, I had to learn Portuguese. This, to me, was like part of the war. It was a terrible disappointment, because here I was, I was 14 years old. To go into the sixth grade was so humiliating. And I was also very tall, I was as tall as I am today, or if not ta ller, cause I\u2122ve begun to shrink. But \u0152 so this was a terrible, terrible blow to me, and there was nothing you could do about it. So someone told me, and that was my lifesaver, that there\u2122s an American school. And the American school does let yo u earn credits, and it only counts from the ninth grade. I was the right age for the ni nth grade, so if they would let me start in the ninth grade, then I had a chance to \u0152 to be with people my own age, and graduate on time. Problem was that I didn\u2122t kn ow any English at all, just like I didn\u2122t know any Portuguese. So, I \u0152 of course, my parents were convinced that it was six of one, half a dozen of the other, I did have to learn a new langua ge, and that wasn\u2122t the problem. And I must say that I went with \u0152 I had to go with somebody who Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 162would interpret for me. So I went with my half-sister, she spoke excellent English, she \u0152 she was at the interpreters\u2122 school in \u0152 in Switzerland before the war, her English was excellent. And she went w ith me. And we spoke \u0152 we got an appointment, we went there and they told me that if I learned English between October, end of a \u0152 now it\u2122s November alre ady, middle of November, and March, because the school year in Brazil begins in \u0152 on the firs t of March. The long vacation because of the summer season is in the \u0152 is in the winter. So, they would give me some sort of an exam, that would have a little bit of social studies, they gave me some \u0152 they gave me a textbook. General science, a little mathematics. So basically sort of a \u0152 some kind of founda tion. And some Englis h and if I could pass that exam at the end of the summer, over there, by March first, they would let me cu \u0152 go into ninth grade. Now, when I took th \u0152 I studied like crazy from that day on until March first. And then my mother used to say that was \u0152 we had an armchair \u0152 oh, eventually we moved, we got an apartment. We had armchair that she used to say she could have sent easily to take that exam, because an armchair was so saturated with my sitting in there and studying. I studied from morni \u0152 morning to night, I had a dictionary. I had no lessons, nobody help ed me, really. My sister occasionally helped me a little, but I really did it by myself with a dictionary, and my father knew a little English and somehow \u0152 and the American school was Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 163unbelievable, they were so supportive, they really were. And when I was taking that exam, they gave me a dictionary, they let me use a dictionary. And in \u0152 and the only funny experience I had with that was that my mathematics was quite good, I was always good in math. And \u0152 but one of the examples on that exam had to do with dimes, nickels and quarters. And of course, there I had no idea what that was, and I had to leave that question out, but it was th e only one I left out, so I did very well. And I started ninth grade at th \u0152 and I was thrilled, and I worked very hard, and I did very well. And I graduated from \u0152 from the American school when I was 18, four years later. And that\u2122s what brought me to the United States, because the American school did not have rights in Brazil , so I could not have gone on to \u0152 to a university or anything. So that fa \u0152 and I did want to leave, but it was because of that I really had to leave, unless I \u0152 I could have g one to a secretarial school and become a secretary, and there was some talk of doing that, but I didn\u2122t want to do that."

So, I \u0152 so this thing, I finished after the war, and I brought it with me to Brazil .

The \u0152 a closest thing I kept to Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 166a journal was when I came to brazi \u0152 to America, I \u0152 I was here alone, I wrote home to my mother \u0152 well, to my parents actually, but she was the one that answered more, although my father also wrote very often. I wrote daily, because I guess I was lonely, and also I wanted them to know wh at was happening, and I was so far away, and there was such a big sacrifice on their part to send me, that I sort of felt I should do that. And my mother kept all those letters. So those letters still exist, some of them are \u0152 most of them are still in Brazil , my brother has them. And \u0152"

And I did want to leave, because I guess that my feeling, after a few years there \u0152 you see, going to the American school ha \u0152 was a \u0152 it was a mixed blessing in some ways, because my classmates, who were all American, were children of diplomats, business people, an d they kept coming and going.

So you didn\u2122t really have friends. Once the school was over, you didn\u2122t \u0152 not only friends, you didn\u2122t know anyone. That was the second reason.

The country is really very, very nice, and the Brazilians are very nice people. And I later on met some, and my brother did not go to the American school right away. He later transferred. So he has Brazilian friends galore, and \u0152 and also because he married a Brazilian woman, he \u0152 so I know a lot of people \u0152 I knew some through him when \u0152 wh en \u0152 as an older sister when \u0152 because he brought these people home. And he \u0152 he \u0152 they\u2122re lovely people, and they\u2122re not \u0152 they\u2122re not anti-Semitic, they\u2122re not \u0152 they\u2122re just very nice, hospitable, warm people. So \u0152 but what I didn\u2122t like there was that basically my social life was within the ca \u0152 what we call the colony. In other words, there were two Jewish clubs, and they were social clubs. And so the young people like myself would go there and there would be a record player, and you danced, and you dated these people and so on. But it was very, very provincial. I always used to say, by the time I woke up, if I Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 168went to a dance, or \u0152 and stayed out, you know, til midnight and then slept late the next morning, by the time I woke up, my mother knew who I danced with, what I did, where I went and the whole thing. So it was \u0152 it was very, very provincial. And my parents social life also reflected that, you know. Lot of emphasis of who or what and where and when and how. So, because of that, I also wanted to leave, and when I came here, I had \u0152 to America, I came to New York , I had this wonderful feeling that nobody cared what I did, nobody. And I was on my own and I was free, and I didn\u2122t have to \u0152 to worry about anybody. I did like it, even though I was alone, I did like it very, very much."

            "answer": "Oh, that\u2122s actually a cute story. He \u0152 my father was a banker in Krak\u00f3w before the war, and my f \u0152 late father-in-law was in the banking business in Lw\u00f3w in eastern Poland . And so they had done some business together. They were not friends, but \u0152 because they were living in different cities and it was a little bit \u0152 they Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 171were different. But they had done some business together, and my late father-in-law found out from some \u0152 some Polish people from Krak\u00f3w that \u0152 who were neighbors of his actually, in the building where he lived, was a family from Krak\u00f3w who knew my parents, and found out that I was here by myself, studying. So he called me on night and said, my name is Oskar Gruss, and he \u0152 he was \u0152 said, I knew your father, and I would like to \u0152 you to come for dinner. Now, I had gotten quite a number of invitations like that, because ma ny people knew my parents \u0152 well, my father, before the war. And if \u0152 they heard that I was alone in New York, so they would invite me. And most of these ee \u0152 di nners were deadly boring, terrible. So \u0152 and most of the names of the people who i nvited me, prior to this call, I had heard about at home, you know, the \u0152 they \u0152 but th is name I had never heard, so I decided that I wasn\u2122t going to go there for dinner, and rush \u0152 he wanted me to come Friday night. I said, I\u2122m sorry, Friday night I can\u2122t. So he said, when can you? So I said, Monday in two weeks, because I figured ou t \u0152 it took a week \u0152 it took five days actually, to write \u0152 to write a letter home and get an answer, so that would be 10 days. So it gave me over two weeks to fi nd out who this person was. So he said Monday in two weeks, okay. And he said, we eat early, and \u0152 so be there at 6:30. All right, so I said goodbye and I said I would be. And in the meantime I wrote home to my parents, and I said such an Oskar Gruss called me, invited me for dinner, shall I Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 172go? Who is it? So I got back an answer su re enough, and my father wrote that there was such a person, he was in the banking business, he was in Lw\u00f3w, and he remembers him, you know, vaguely, not terri bly, but \u0152 and that if I have nothing better to do on that Monday evening, I can go, I should go. So I decided to go. So I went and I got there at 6:30 sharp and I \u0152 my mother-in-law \u0152 my future mother-in-law opened the door, and I saw this blank th ing \u0152 he completely forgot to tell her. But she caught on quite quickly, he mu \u0152 th ey must have talked about me, because once I stood there \u0152 first I saw this blank stare, and then she \u0152 she sort of caught on who I was. I introduced myself, and she was very nice. And then I saw the maid setting another place, so obviously everybody had forgotten about me. And then I sat \u0152 and she was very nice to me, and we sat on the sofa and she actually asked me a lot about what we had gone through, and wha \u0152 where was I and what was I doing, and so on. So, about half an hour later, the key turns in the door, and in comes my father-in-law first, and my future husband behind him. And my father-in-law sort of went with his head, oh my God, he said, cause he remembered he for \u0152 that he forgot completely that I was coming. Anyhow, then we sat down to dinner, and dinner was a disaster, because my husband had a sist er who\u2122s no longer alive, and she was studying \u0152 oh, she was in third year law school, I think. And they were in Wall Street, and the conversation, even though I knew English, seemed to me that I Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 173didn\u2122t understand one word, didn\u2122t know what they were talking about. And so that was dinner, and then right after dinner, we got up and my future husband said, I\u2122m very sorry, but I have an appointment, a nd he got up and he le ft. And I said to myself, I\u2122m going to wait 20 minutes, because I was told someone doesn\u2122t get up from the table and leave. But this was ho rrible, so I said to myself, I\u2122ll wait 20 minutes and then I\u2122m leaving. So, during those 20 minutes, we sat on the sofa and my father-in-law also sat with us, my mother-in-law talked some more. And she was very nice, I liked her. And she \u0152 and my husband came back before those 20 minutes were up. I later found out that he did have a busin ess appointment on Broadway , not far from where they lived, at the Schrafft\u2122s, they used to meet there at that time, and he had no way of c ontacting this person, so he ran over, told him I can\u2122t be with you tonight, and came back, brought me hom e. So that was very nice. That was very, very nice. Then I wrote home to my parents that \u0152 described the dinner, more or less, in the way \u0152 and there was one other detail that I omitted. My parents-in-law had the large collection of Jewish paintings, you know, as they s \u0152 they just now actually was \u0152 part of it went to the museum, the Jewish museum in New York. But they were all Oppenheimers (ph) and Kaufmans , so they were these Jewish heads. And all these things were staring down at me. And my father-in-law and my future husband, this was a Monday night, were sitting in kippot . I had never seen that in Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 174my life. So I was a little bit taken by that, you know, it was such a different kind of home, I\u2122d never seen anything like that. So that was a little strange. So anyhow, I wrote to my parents home about this whole evening, and I got a letter back from my father saying, in the year 1930, with a question mark, I remember sending him a present for his Bar Mitzvah. Why isn\u2122t he married yet? So anyway, so that\u2122s how I met my husband. We started going out, he started taking me out. This was in February, so it was about a year after I came to New York. And I went and \u0152 we went out from February til \u0152 til June. June I was going home for my vacation, because my s-school year was over. And I \u0152 he took me \u0152 he told me \u0152 he brought me a little radio, I remember, he brought me a present, the \u0152 the \u0152 just before I was leaving, and he said to me, I\u2122m very sorry, I won\u2122t be able to take you to the ship to see you off \u0152 I was traveling by ship \u0152 beca use he said, it\u2122s a holiday. And I said, a holiday? Well, it turned out it was Shavuot, which was a holiday I never even heard about. So at that point I found out that he\u2122s observant. He kept it from me, from \u0152 from February until June, he took me out \u0152 I didn\u2122t realize that he was ordering fish, because I didn\u2122t really care what he was ordering. But we went out a lot, and I didn\u2122t realize that he was religious. Never asked me out on a Friday, but you know, th-that was \u0152 I didn\u2122t think about it. So when I came home to Rio , he came for the Fourth of Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 175July weekend, and he came to my \u0152 to our home, he met my parents, and so on and so forth. And we got engaged in September, after I came back. End of Tape Five, Side B Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 176Beginning Tape Six, Side A"

And I had met this young \u0152 youngish woman who has an only daughter, talking to another youngish woman who has an only daughter.

So I \u0152 I told Brenda about this, I said, I never was concerned about \u0152 I mean, if the school took them someplace, I never thought that there was any \u0152 so Brenda said, maybe i \u0152 and I said, this must be because Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 179they\u2122re only children. And Brenda said no, maybe it\u2122s because you went through so much when you were a child, that \u0152 that what we were doing was so protected and so normal, never occurred to you that something could happen. And maybe that\u2122s true, as the \u0152 I thought about it. It was just something that happened 10 days ago, I started thinking about it, maybe she\u2122s right.

On the other hand, from having read a lot about survivors, I know that many of them are overp \u0152 very, very overprotective of their children.

And we went to \u0152 to Krak\u00f3w , and we ac \u0152 actually, it was the only time in my life, including the wars, interestingly enough, that I experienced outspoken anti-Semitism. Because during the war I never experienced it. I mean, I knew they were murdering Jews, but the Germans were doing it, and I personally never did. I wasn\u2122t in school, so I never did. And \u0152 and the Polish people, I also have very strong opinions about pe ople \u0152 Polish people helping Jews, because those Jews who survived like I did, at one point or another had to be helped by Christians. Otherwise there was no hope, there was no way you could have survived. But anyway, I wa \u0152 we were in Krak\u00f3w and we went to visit Auschwitz. Was a Sunday morning. And we came back, and bo th my husband and I speak Polish, and we had \u0152 we took a taxi or a driver, or whatever. And we came back from Auschwitz, it must have been like two o\u2122clock Sunday, and \u0152 we went early in the morning, and we were starved. So we wanted \u0152 but we didn\u2122t \u0152 you feel funny after going there, funny. You feel very strange.

You know, a normal kind of place. So \u0152 so he said, okay, he\u2122ll take us where he sometim es eats and many of the cab drivers and workers eat there. So he said a very unpretentious kind of \u0152 that\u2122s what we were looking for, something unpret entious. So he took us there, and it was crowded, and it Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 187was unpretentious and it was very crowded, and they were seating people together with other people. So we sat down \u0152 they to ld us to sit at a table where there was a young couple. They were speaking Po lish. My husband and I were speaking English, because \u0152 but of course, they were speaking Polish because they were Polish, and we understood every word. A nd we sat down and we \u0152 I don\u2122t know, we spoke about, I don\u2122t know what we spoke ab out, but we spoke English. And there was no menu, so we got a big plate of saue rkraut, mashed \u0152 and big, big portions, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and some sort of meat. And I \u0152 I\u2122m a very good eater, but it was a huge portion, particularly there were a lot of these potatoes. So I finished everything except about half the potatoes. And she, the young woman, turned to her whoever he was, escort or \u0152 or boyfriend or husband, I don\u2122t know what he was, and she said to him, look she \u0152 he s \u0152 she said \u0152 and it\u2122s true that at that time there were still shortages in Poland \u0152 one always has to understand where it all comes from \u0152 and she said, look she\u2122s \u0152 he \u0152 she said, she didn\u2122t finish her potatoes. That \u0152 and so he said, yeah, I see, and then she said \u0152 she was more virulent than he \u0152 she was virulent, he wasn\u2122t. And she said, they\u2122re probably not good enough for her. And then she turned to him and said, look, she has this big Jewish nose. It was the only time \u0152 and to th is day I\u2122m really mad at myself that I didn\u2122t say any \u0152 something. But I was so taken aback. Also, I was so innocently Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 188accused, because I just couldn\u2122t finish those potatoes. But the point was, that this was the only time, in all my life \u0152 I told my husband \u0152 the only time that I experienced anti-Semitism, you know, in its rawest kind of form. So, nothing, I didn\u2122t finish the potatoes, and they left, and so on. I wasn\u2122t \u0152 they finished, I mean, th-they had \u0152 she made that one remark, and then she didn\u2122t focus on us at all. But it was interesting.

            "answer": "Oh, yes, owned, owned, ow ned. From her collection. I found \u0152 first, what you do is, what most people I think do is, you sort of look around and you figure out whether this person was alive during the war or not. That\u2122s what most people do and Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 194I did that to some degree also. And I soon realized that most people were not alive, because they \u0152 they were younger, my age or younger. A nd even if they were my age, then they were children during the war, so then I started telling myself that you can\u2122t \u0152 you know, you can\u2122t hold \u0152 think a bout that all the time, you just cannot. And would I want to live there? No. Do I hate them? No. You know, it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s hard to say what I think about them. I don\u2122t kn ow whether they are any worse than \u0152 I often wonder what would happen in this country if there would be gradually, as very gradually our \u0152 th-the Nazi racial laws were \u0152 they didn\u2122t \u0152 they weren\u2122t done from one day to the next. People don\u2122t realize that. It came on very gradually. If there would be such laws passed against the black population, would we react, would we s \u0152 you know, some of us maybe the vi \u0152 but most of us would not. We would just sit quietly and \u0152 and \u0152 and probably not go out and help people and so on. So therefore I \u0152 I also know that helping was very, very difficult during the war. It was risky, it was dangerous, it was more than \u0152 I mean, in Poland people who helped were executed. They \u0152 there was no trial, no anything if they were caught. So, under those circumstances, would I do that for somebody else? Probably not. So therefore I have no \u0152 I don\u2122t hold it against them, I don\u2122t ha te them. That\u2122s my feeling. I wouldn\u2122t want to live there, but then I wouldn\u2122t want to live anywhere except here, so it\u2122s the same \u0152 same thing. But I have \u0152 I \u0152 no, I don\u2122t hate \u0152 I don\u2122t hate that \u0152 hate them, Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 195no. Just like I don\u2122t hate the Poles for that one \u0152 I didn\u2122t enjoy that one anti-Semitic incident, but I don\u2122t hate them, no. I\u2122ve ha d some very good experiences with Polish people as well. We were on a hiking trip, I\u2122ll never get \u0152 we went \u0152 my husband and I, we \u0152 one of the trips that we took, we went to Krak\u00f3w about two \u0152 two or three years ago when I start \u0152 when they started giving back pr operty, we \u0152 I went, and we saw lawyers and we did this and that a nd the other. And then there was a Polish holiday, so we suddenly found ourselves with three days or four days as \u0152 a weekend, and over the weekend, and so we decided to go to Zakopane . We had to remain, we had appointments afterwards. Zakopane is in the mountains, in the \u0152 in the Tatra mountains. And both my husband and I enjoy hiking, they have wonderful walks there, so we went. And we met \u0152 it was a sort of difficult, somewhat steep hike for us, and it was after a rain, and there was moss and it was a little slippery. So climbing up was not bad, but I was afraid that it\u2122s not a loop. I wasn\u2122t sure it\u2122s a loop, and I was afraid of coming down the same trail. So, there was a young woman with a better trail map than what we had, which was not very good. And she was going up and I \u0152 we asked he r whether it was a loop and so on, and she said, yes, it was a loop, we didn\u2122t have to come down the same way. And then she said she was a very good hiker, and she said she\u2122s going ahead, but she has two or three friends coming behind and they are slow, and they \u2122ll probably catch up with us, and we Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 196should just follow them, and okay, thank you very mu ch. We went up, and then sure enough there was a bu \u0152 they came up behind us and then we confirmed the route, and then they went ahead, and they were still faster than we. And eventually we \u0152 we met up with them again at the top where there was a beautiful overlook. And going \u0152 so, we already had talked with th em, so we asked them about going down, which way the \u0152 you know, th-th-the \u0152 the tr ail, which was the best way to go down, the easiest way, we were looking for. So th ey explained to us, and they explained to us that at some point there\u2122s going to be a V and we had to take an \u0152 but there was another little trail, and then you had to take the left, but it was difficult. They said it would be a little bit maybe difficult to find. So, we got there, to that point, and there they were again. And they were sitting and waiting for us, and on the ground there was, in little pebbles, they had made an arrow which one \u0152 but \u0152 and they showed us that this is the arrow and they made it for us. And then I said, so why are you here? And they said, because we were really c oncerned about you, so we decided to wait for you after all. I\u2122ve hiked in America , I\u2122ve hiked in \u0152 in Switzerland , we\u2122ve hiked in France, nothing like that ever happened to us. Did they know we were Jewish? Probably yes, because the way we speak Polish, th-they \u0152 we both speak well, but we don\u2122t \u0152 y-you know, when you haven\u2122t be en in a country for 45 years, even if you speak continuously, it\u2122s a little \u0152 the language is a little different. And a-also, Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 197they knew we had \u0152 were tourists, from the way we dress, from the way we \u0152 th-there\u2122s no \u0152 I mean, nobody thought the \u0152 so that was very nice, very nice. Then we started talking some more, they invited us to their homes, but th ey \u0152 they were not from Zakopane , they were also there \u0152 they were someplace from the north of Poland where we wer \u0152 never went. But, you know, that was something and I thought it was very, very nice. Never happened anywhere else. So you can\u2122t tell. People are people, and they\u2122re different, and everybody\u2122s different."

For instance, I found that f \u0152 I don\u2122t remember what the name of it was, a book that somebody recommended to me just last year, about women. It was called, between courage and something else. Not a very good title, I Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 203thought. A woman who is, I think a sociologi \u0152 a professor of sociology, whatever, and who wrote about women in Germany , ger \u0152 the Jewish women in Germany, between 1933 and \u212239. It wasn\u2122t even ab out the war. And I found \u0152 that kind of thing I find very interesting because it \u0152 it talked about how the structure of the family changed, as the men were losing th eir positions and were not allowed to wo \u0152 to execute, let\u2122s say, doctors were not allowed to practice, you know, as the racial laws progressed in Germany. Before the war, women tended to sometimes earn a living, sometimes the men became so is olated and so discouraged and so demoralized that the women were the f \u0152 th-the force behind the family. Also, when they had the discriminatory laws against children in schools, it was the women who went to the schools, and \u0152 and \u0152 and were in touch w ith the children, and heard about all of that. Also, when the husband was arrested, wh ich happened very often at that point, or had some running in with the police, it was the women who went in and tried to \u0152 to talk to the police and tried to help the husbands. It totally changed the structure of the family.

And I find that kind of thing interests me very much. It \u0152 It\u2122s partly, you know, German anti-Semitism, Holocaust, but it\u2122s not just a story of what somebody went through, but how it affected life and affected the families, and Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 204affected every-everything; how it changed things; how it showed \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I also noticed that in my own family, that my mother was the much more, somehow, resourceful person during the war than my father, who had a tremendous position before the war. But once all of this was taken away from him, he \u0152 it \u0152 and I, of course, as a child I never understood what was going on. Th at kind of thing interests me, that kind of thing I read.

And I remember \u0152 and I said to myself, this is lovely, but, you know, it\u2122s really not terribly much; they make such a fuss over it. But what we had in Siberia, the snow falls and it di \u0152 never, ever melts. And I rememb er when we were going to this school there, there was like a little \u0152 it was like a corridor and on both sides the snow came up to practically my \u0152 to my shoulders, I \u0152 just my little head was out there. So \u0152 and it was like that for months and months. So, yes, I did think about that for a moment, but just as a joke, rather than \u0152 you know, it doesn\u2122t trigger anything horrible.

So I said to her \u0152 I said to him, it\u2122s going to go to the museum, the Holocaust Museum. And he \u0152 and he said why? And I said, well, you know, maybe someday somebody is going to study about what happened in Europe at that time, and maybe they\u2122ll look for somebody who was not very old, or was still a child and was in Hungary. And they\u2122ll look up in the index and they\u2122ll look up Hungary , and there\u2122ll be one other story, it will be different from what Hungarian children went through, becau se I\u2122m \u0152 wasn\u2122t Hungarian, I \u0152 and ho \u0152 he said oh.
