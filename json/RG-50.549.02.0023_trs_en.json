            "answer": "Yes. My name is Stefan Czyzewski and I never spelled it differently, except for duration of 1941 to \u201845, I carried a different last name and I was a-at that time, I was Stefan Grot, G-r-o-t. And reason for change, that none of us in the -- in my fighting group carried his own name. In most cases, we just had one word pseudonym -- pseudoname. In my case, I carried a full name, but my last name was different from the original."

            "answer": "Yes, we -- my father hid a friend, whose name was Ithzac Visipka and his two children. One was about eight, one was about 11, a boy and a girl. And the tragedy of my father\u2019s life was that they were killed, very close to the end of the war. During one of the pacifications, Mr. Visipka just couldn\u2019t stand it, sitting in hiding, so he took off and ran and was caught in a field -- in open field by pacification squad, the German SS group and he was killed and his children were killed. And the bad part of it 1s, too, that they were shot only once and wer -- they were dying for a long, long time. They refused to shoot them second time. And of course, later on, they came and took my father. Somebody apparently reported and my father, he had to dig a grave for them and bury them. And they also were going to shoot my father -- father, with them, but my father was a foxy old man, so before he went there, he went into a closet, he pulled ours -- out his Isen cross that the Germans gave him in the first World War, pinned it up on his jacket and dug the hole. After he buried this -- I mean, after he laid these people in, he even put his jacket over their faces. And they said, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d So he turned around and said, \u201cDo you want to kill a German hero?\u201d So they looked, and he had a -- his citation with him, in his pocket. They read the citation and said, \u201cOld man, you escaped this time. Don\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d And they let him go."

            "answer": "Was very -- very simple. Everybody -- just about everybody I knew was hiding a Jewish person or two or three. Just about everybody in our -- in our village -- in our village of 52 household, we had probably 20 or 30 Jewish people being hidden. Some survived, some did not. One person that we hid, did survive. She was a young Jewish woman and she did survive. Later on she served in the Polish government. I don\u2019t -- I know her name was Maria, but I don\u2019t re -- know her -- never knew her last name. She was a friend of Mr. Jebbe, who was a tailor, who was also with us for some time, but he was killed during one of the pacifications."

She decided to go to the ghe -- stay in ghetto and she even decided to go to the Warsaw ghetto, where she perished, apparently. But Mr. Visipka did not want to stay in ghetto, since he was used to roaming the villages. Before the war, he carried bundle for his mother, Golda, who was a peddler and he knew everybody and everybody knew Mr. Visipka. So he thought that he would survive among the Polish people."

So, I made a little trap door in a ceiling of the barn and I made a chamber among the straw above that trap door. It was nice and warm. It was stinky, of course, but who cared about stink at that time? And Mr. Visipka stayed there, on and off. He would go places. He -- we would go to work in a field for some of the farmers who had so-called farms on outskirts. He could not work on our farm, because our farm was within a village and too many people would have seen him. So he went to work for people who -- who were all alone somewhere on the side of -- on the edge of the forest. And he would stay and work with them. Then they will come back, he will get -- bring some food. And of course, food was never short in our place, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about that."

There was one moment -- we were notified by somebody who knew about the pacification squad coming in, so we told Mr. Visipka, \u201cGet in and stay there and don\u2019t peek out.\u201d Well, Mr. Visipka left his children. He couldn\u2019t stand it, he ran away. Later on he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be found and have all of you killed.\u201d So he came back next -- next day, wet, muddy, cold. And he said, \u201cNo panyan. I had three lucks. The first luck was the German didn\u2019t kill me. The second luck wa -- luck was, your dog didn\u2019t eat me.\u201d We had a big, big dog. \u201cAnd the third luck was, I didn\u2019t drown in the mud.\u201d He ran into the forest, just about 200 feet from our barn and hid in the mud there.

And after the war, she worked for the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Minz, in the Polish government. And she was twice, I think, instrumental in saving my father from the Communists."

So my father went and threaten him, so they ha-had him arrested and beat him up and of course, Maria came and saved him. And a couple weeks later, somebody went out at night and shot up the house of the person who was forcing everybody into it, and I know who that was. My father was a [indecipherable] was short-tempered. He has a gun, he had a machine gun. He could do almost anything, within reason."

And my father spoke Russian very well, because he served in south imperial army, and they became friends, and that Ivan, as we called him, came and went. After the war, we discovered that he led all the Communist partisans in our territory and he was sa -- and he was a general in charge of an Russian pantzer division in a town of Minsk, which was about 10 - 15 miles from our farm. So, when my father was arrested second time, my sister went and tried to talk to the man in charge in Minsk. And of course, they wouldn\u2019t let her talk to him, but eventually she prevailed. She just sat down and wouldn\u2019t move and talked to Ivan Ivanovitch. I don\u2019t know if it was his real name or not. He came storming in, in an army car with two soldiers and a -- and a driver and he came to the county village. He took the police, put them against the wall and ta -- got my father out of jail and said, \u201cYanna, do you want to shoot those son of a bitches?\u201d And father said, \u201cOh, no, they do their work. But they beat me up, so I want to hit them few times.\u201d So, he hit them few times. And they were warned, they were told, \u201cIf you ever happen -- anything happens to John ever, I\u20191l come and shoot you, you [indecipherable] and so and so.\u201d"

People from the Polish underground, some of my boys who were hurt, who were shot, stayed for a few days, couple weeks. As you -- as I mentioned previously, I think my mother - my mother, my grandmother, was a witch doctor. She had weeds, she -- she -- she had herbs, she had all kind of stuff and she could cure almost anybody out of anything. She couldn\u2019t grow legs or arms, but she could do almost anything else.

And for a time we made efforts not to get surrounded by the Einsatzgruppen that we went to fight. Later on, when we -- when we received our good armament, especially after we bought whole lot of -- after we bought a whole lot of Schmizers from a German supply officers, were so heavily armed, that the Germans had no chance with us, whatsoever. As I mentioned in my previous interview, the 75 to 120 people in a German Einsatzgruppen would have four automatic weapons and rest would be manual rifles. My group of 17 plus two, carried 27 Schmizers, because 10 of my boys did not trust the damn German weapon, they wanted to have two. So, we had a su-surplus of it, so each of them carried two. And we had such a enormous firepower that he, on purpose wanted to be surrounded so we could get into fire -- a real firefight and get out of it and well, knock out more people than we normally would have."

The AK, the army akaioba already had a group like mine from that neighborhood. They took one of my friends who came with me, as a leader. And the NSZ people had better armament that they could provide us with and also they were very much against the Soviet Union. They hated the damn Communists.

            "answer": "That was probably the only aspect that I didn\u2019t cherish. Also, in my very neighborhood, in my very group, we were not. As I previously mentioned, I had two people in my group who survived the whole schmier. Out of the four, who are left out of the 20, two of them were Jewish boys. Isaac One and Isaac Two. And we had -- I have known another probably half a dozen Jewish young men who were in a group. Some even were in a command.

If we wanted sometime to go one way, they would -- one of them would say, \u201cWalcheem, no we don\u2019t want to go that way, we want to go around.\u201d So we went around and we discovered later on if we went that way, we would have gotten knocked out. So it was more on a personal level than on a ideological level. They trusted you, you trusted them.

            "answer": "The sabotage part of it was probably the most extens-extensive and took the longest time. They taught us techniques -- how to use old dynamite, which was the only explosive that we could fi -- get in Poland for a long, long time. And how to build that plate -- carry and put metal plate on the -- under the explosives, under the rail. They taught us, if they -- we did not have explosives, they tol -- they trained us how to loosen up a rail to detrain a train. But in most cases, the most effective would have been explosives. They told us how to use batteries and since we did not have good equipment, we -- you just hung up to two little wires in your hand. Your hand shook and you wondered if y -- if you are going to blow the damn thing on time or after the train went by, which sometime it happened. My commander was mad at me at ev -- every time I missed that thing, he wanted to court martial and we -- he threatened to put me against the wall and shoot me if I missed. But of course, later on he told me, \u201cI would never shoot you, because you are useful. You are a good tool.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t know if I was a good tool or not, but I tried my darnest. They told us how to attach explosive to doors or to gates or to the brick wall. How to remove a brick from a brick wall, surrounding an object or how to dig out quickly, break out of a brick building and put explosives in it. And how to stretch the wire, how to use -- how to use fuse. How long each fuse would burn -- how many feet per minute it would burn. How many meters per a minute it would burn. How far you had to be from an objective if you blow it up. Which side of the object you were blowing up, you were supposed to be on, if possible. If it\u2019s not possible, how to hide, what to hide 1n, how to best hide. The best pla -- best place to hide was to dig a foxhole. You didn\u2019t have time to dig the foxhole, so you hi -- you were kind of in a halfway quandary and great excitement and being scared and being perplexed. And strange enough, I can\u2019t believe it, but most of the times, perhaps seven out of 10, maybe eight, sometime nine out of 10, we were lucky and effective."

He apparently was a person of consequence, because he had a beautiful tent, he had several wives and a lot of children and he had a party for us. And for some reason or another -- I think because I was the smallest one -- so he gave me the biggest two pillows to sit on and I must have become some kind of a prominent person in his estimation, because his beau -- most beautiful wife was serving me and she sa -- even sat next to me couple of times. And then, when the main course came, or the most important course came, which was sheep eyes, it was a big dish of sheep eyes, he handed them to me and he said, \u201cYou eat as many of those as you can.\u201d Because that was an so-called honor dish. So I said, \u201cWell, I thank you very much for your recognition, but I would like to share it with all of you, so you are the first one to share with me.\u201d So he took one and ev -- I sent it around and everybody took one. By the time it came back to me, there was only one eye left. So I put it in and I swallowed it, almost choked on it. And, you cannot chew a sheep\u2019s eye, just like a little billiard ball. You swallow it And I did choke at the end, of course. Then, there was a cumis to drink. And cumis is an Arabian and Persian drink that is made of 100 percent alcohol and mir -- milk. They put it in a leather bag, a man gets on a horse and he rides out of a des -- in a desert -- in heat, whatever. And he rides a long distance there and a long distance back and that thing gets way -- well shaken -- well mixed. Then they cool it off and you drink it. And is the smoothest drink you have ever drunk. And if yo -- and it\u2019s -- it goes in so neatly, but man, the katzenjammer you get. That was the worst hangover I ever had. After I drank the drink, I almost dropped. I sat for the rest of the party, I didn\u2019t know where I was. I was sick all night. I was mo -- sick most of the next morning and I forswore alcohol forever and a day. Well, of course, I didn\u2019t drink for at least four weeks after that. That was the greatest party I ever went to and I don\u2019t remember much of it after the first drink."

They were worrying if they were maybe -- if they may be forced to repatriate back to Communist Poland. They were discussing possibilities of emigration. At that time, all in 1945, six, even seven, nobody dreamed that he -- they would be able to go to America. America was kind of a seventh heaven somewhere way up there. Nobody thought they would ever be able to reach it. So, many people started emigrating in 1948, to Belgium, to work in the coal mines. To Great Britain to work in the coal mines. Later on, when emigration became available to Canada, many people -- many, many people went to Canada. Then eventually, U.S. legislation passed a special bill that allowed the refugees from Displaced Person camp to come here outside of the quota. They still ha-had kind ofa quota and people from certain countries had easier time coming here than from others. And the Polish people especially, were given certain preference. So, a lot of Polish Jewish people were coming to America and a lot of Poles were coming to America. And a lot of Russian, Ukrainian and White Russian people, falsify a doc -- their documents as if they were Polish citizens, and also came in here. So the conversations, a lot of it was, \u201cCan I go to America? Can I go to Australia? Oh, can I go to Canada?\u201d But everybody wanted to come to the seventh heaven, which was America."

            "answer": "Well, they didn\u2019t have chance to get jobs in Germany. There was hunger, privation and no jobs to be had. Also, we were not allowed to apply for civilian jobs. So they were kind of kept caged. If you wanted to go out, you had to have a permission -- written permission to go out, with a hope of emigrating somewhere.

Even now, when I walk down the street and I see a penny, or a piece of paper, or an old shoelace, I pick it up. We just hoarded everything, because well, you never know. Maybe tomorrow you are going to be hungry or maybe I want to tie my shoes and I wouldn\u2019t have anything to tie them with. And most of us kind of outgrew it and adjusted. At least, I hope I adjusted. I have some strange custom and habits and thoughts occasionally, but I don\u2019t rave and don\u2019t -- well, don\u2019t seem to be abnormal.

That was freedom, that was a free country and a perpetrator is a perpetrator and consequently, you -- you don\u2019t feel guilty about sending them to jail. Also, very few of them went to jail. Many of them were kept in a -- in a camp jail for a few weeks, few months, but they were not sent to German prisons. And there were some very humorous things occasionally, like for instance, a group of boys went and they stole a cow. And they made the cow walk to the fifth floor, into the attic. They slaughtered it and were selling the meat. Somebody reported them and of course, I was assigned to it. I grabbed three policemen and we went up and we looked and we searched the whole block, we couldn\u2019t find 1t. Then we went with an attic -- in the attic and sure, there was a whole lot of meat still left, a lot of bones. \u201cHow did you get the cow up here?\u201d \u201cWell, she walked up the steps.\u201d And later on, when I interrogated that [indecipherable] perpetrators, said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t see the cow. The cow just came to a block, walked up the steps. I couldn\u2019t make her go down, so I had to kill her. And why waste all that good meat after I killed her? I got to do something. I couldn\u2019t eat it all -- all by myself, so I had to sell some.\u201d We heard many tall stories. And that was the tallest story ever."

At the beginning maybe it was little worse, because there were a lot of young, unattached people who paired on and paired off, but the influence of the Catholic church was very strong in the camp. There were priests, there were chapels, there were churches. And people went to Confession, people went to Communion. People went to Mass. Hardly anybody ever missed a Mass, except some hooligans who thought the -- there was few concentration -- former concentration camp inmates who lost belief in God, because they said, \u201cIf something like this happened, God does not exist.\u201d But very, very few, so it wasn\u2019t much worse than anywhere else. And, since li -- people lived in such a close proximity, you know, five, six, seven, well, the room I was in was smaller than this room. One room, there were five of us living in 1t. Some-Sometime 11 people lived in a room -- room of this size. Everybody knew everything about everybody else. So, if something happens, well, watch out, you get deported and a priest would come to talk to you and say, \u201cYou inferial so and so, you better not do it.\u201d Well, some people lived together and it was -- that was kind of almost semi-accepted. They are lonely, they have nobody else, they have somebody to take care of them. And many people who were supposed to be leaders or else people to give good example, or people to enforce the proper behavior, did not behave properly themselves.

Also, it will probably seem pathetic, because those two people who helped me the most, spent time in a concentration camp also, or else a prisoner\u2019s of war camp and those two people, Captain Psheckfass and Mr. Shimienski, who was a camp commander -- police commander in Ashafenberg and also worked in a policer in Wildeflecken, was very sympathetic and very helpful. Later on, when I got to know Lieutenant Penjik, he also helped me survive in the -- in the police department. He was one of the dignitaries there who did not very much, but was a very elegant person, a well-spoken person. The drinkit -- drinkest person I ever met and we were very close friends and they always thought, \u201cThat little boy, I got to help him.\u201d And they did. So I felt very fortunate and I tried to do my best whe -- in whatever I did and in most cases, apparently succeeded because I was never canned. I was never fired. I was called on the carpet from time to time and told what should not be done and what should be done, but never was really punished, as my document states. He is going to United States and he was never punished, except before."

Your choices which were almost instinctively to fight and resist, versus just obeying the Germans or trying to wait it out. How do you account for those choices you made?",
            "answer": "Well, I thought that -- I thought it was inborn, because all my forefathers were fighters and active. I had a grand-grand-grandfather who fought the Soviet -- the Soviet -- the Russian Souse regime and ended in say -- with a death sentence and later on was commuted to 25 years in Siberia. I had people who fought with the Polish legion during Napoleonic wars. I had forefathers who had served in diplomatic service and were active. I had my father, who wore -- fought in the first World War on three fronts. He fought with the Russians against the Prussians and with the Prussians against the French, with the -- with the French and Polish against the Germans. So I guess, if it wasn\u2019t inborn, at least I could think back about it and act accordingly. Didn\u2019t want to be bystander. And of course, my ego was enormous. I knew I could do almost anything, and went and most of the time I didn\u2019t, sometime I did. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection"

A German survivor -- I read that she said as a German, she just -- just obeyed when they -- when the SS told her to do something, she did it and she -- she went to camp and she never considered saying no. What about the Polish culture and -- and within your own family, what kind of things were you taught?",
            "answer": "Polish people in the first place, are very contrary. Also very disputatious. You would say -- have four Poles dis-discussing certain set of ideas. They would have seven ideas and nobody gives. Consequently, when we get hit, we hit back hard. Poland, in history, was overran many times by neighbors who were 10 times more powerful. Poland was divided and subdivided by three neighbors who were -- each one was three times as big as Poland and being under occupation of Prussia, Austria and Russia, Poland had, oh my God, probably half a dozen really heavy uprisings and probably dozen and a half of smaller uprisings. They were being killed, they were being hung, they were drowned, they were sent to Siberia. They were -- spent time in Magdaburg -- German citadel prison. Polish -- creator of Polish state, after first World War, Marshall Pisoutski spent couple years in a German prison in Madgaburg. So, we kind of thought that we are the fighting people and we tried to prove it. Most of the time we did not succeed, at times we did. That was probably kind of loyalty to -- to your state, loyalty to your nation, especially, and acting upon it. And probably most of the -- most of it is that we are qu -- we were quite foolhardy. When I corresponded with my first cousin, who spent about 10 years in a Communist prison -- after she was released, we wrote to each other before she died. I said, \u201cWell gee, why didn\u2019t you go out and fight [indecipherable] And she said, \u201cWe have grown now. We want to conduct ourself properly, we want to go by vote, we want to go and work hard and perhaps we will succeed. We must have grown.\u201d Well, when I knew Poland and when I knew myself and my se -- environment during the war and before the war, looks like we have not grown yet, we just went and hid and fight -- and fought."

So you keep pouring crushed rock and keep -- and you put your heavy shovel among the crushed rock and you hold it up or top with your hands -- the top of the shovel. And you put your foot on the shovel down below and press on it and you rock back and forth, back and forth, pushing the stone under the tie, so eventually the tie becomes tight against the rail. So people doing this kind of work were called gandy dancers. I was a gandy dancer on a railroad section for almost a year."

His name is Vonsan and we 3 see him every day, we say hello every day and we visit back and forth frequently. And later on, we sponsored two of his brothers, who father sent out, they became boat people. Ended somewhere in Indonesia or somewhere and we sponsored those two. They came, stayed with us short time, but most of the time did not, because the -- Vonsan became independent, had an apartment. So we, of course, we visited a lot back and forth and those two boys are too married -- also married, have children and families and jobs. And we sometime visit with them, sometime see them. And there was a large group of Vietnamese boys who used to come to Milos or for a visit and they still occasionally come and see us. Even bring us little gifts, especially after 15 years, just about every one gave him a clo -- I -- gave us a clock. I have several funny looking clocks around. Gar-Garish things with butterflies and -- and crazy things in them. Holy -- Holy statues in them."

            "answer": "Well, I don\u2019t know. Sylvia is very good person and she is very sympathetic to people. And seeing that I was a refugee at one time, we kind of did little sponsoring. And also, our parish -- our Catholic parish sponsored many, many Laotian, Vietnamese and Mung families. And for a long time, we were, and then I was on a committee that worked with them, finding them jobs and places to live and collecting clothing and -- and furniture and things. Presently, we are not doing much, or hardly 4 any of it, because I\u2019m old and Sylvia is catching up with me. I\u2019m ancient and she -- she 1s getting old, too. She is not nearly as old as Iam. Many, many years younger."

But, mostly, people that I talk to about it, is people that I go to give talk about it, like in school or college or -- or group of people that are interested. So then, they ask many questions and I answer the questions and sometime elaborate, sometime I hard -- hide a lot of stuff, because they would be too shocking for people. And most American people, sus -- especially young people, are completely uninformed and know very little about it. Even adults did not know much about it at that time, or did not pay attention toward the end of time, when the news drifted in here about the atrocities, about American army freeing a lot of dead people in a concentratio -- in death camps. Many people did not batay -- pay attention to it."

Also, I note it was the last two or three years, all of ca -- all of a sudden, just about every school had a -- a Short course on the Holocaust and a short course on the second World War. And that\u2019s mostly the pla -- those other places that invite me to come and talk to them about it. So that is somewhat gratifying. But, for a long time, people were very uninformed 5 about. Also, throughout all the time previously, and now, very well educated people, like for instance, college professors, tried to disprove that the Holocaust ever existed. There\u2019s a group of professor that\u2019s UCLA, who are very vocal about it, telling everybody who wants to listen and everybody who doesn\u2019t want to listen that Holocaust never existed, that was just a concoction made by certain groups of people, trying to influence us this way or that way."
