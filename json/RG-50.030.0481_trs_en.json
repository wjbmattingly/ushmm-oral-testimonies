So they became like brothers, and Hein wa s there alone on that -- so we wrote him all the time. And then I had also to write my little note. Father wrote, Mother wrote, Albert wrote, my sister wrote. So I -- and then you have here only one word, dear. I-If you write a business letter you start dear, but also if you love somebody, but we have different words. So the first letters that I wrote was Beste, that is distance, you know, Beste.

And then Saturday afternoons when we had off from school, we often had school Saturd ay mornings still, we went on our bikes outside The Hague, and we have so many canal s, and ditches, and trees everywhere, and we had the greatest fun that we took a run, and then tried to jump a ditch.

And they were like brother and sister, and I said, \ufb01Are you going to do it?\ufb02 And they said no, we have five kids, it\u2122s too busy, we don\u2122t do it. And the first Sunday after the war it was in our house, and the second Sunday I went to their house, and I couldn\u2122t believe it. You had to go up the stairs, and then over the piano was a big portrait of Hitler. And you had those doors that were gliders, that opened -- they had double doors, and I heard in the other room German speaking, and I look, and I see German soldiers.

But then, when they started on our Jews, n -- we knew was more im portant stuff to do. We still did that, but when we hid the Jews -- but then, it becam e difficult because an -- at the same time, because the Germans were occupying all Euro pe, and they had also drafted the women, they might be the first. But in Germany its elf were only very old people, and very young people. And the war industry was going full blast, and the fields need to be worked, and there were no of that age group. So then, in all the occupied countries, you might have heard that in Norway, and in France probably too, but was always a handsome young man, with beautiful white teeth, blonde hair , big, blue eyes, come to Germany, terrific pay. And that was on the walls, and in the papers everywhere. And there was a lot of unemployment, but we didn\u2122t want to go to Germany. And then, at the same time, that 38 was when they started on the Jewish pe ople, and because the people didn\u2122t go to Germany, because we didn\u2122t want to go to th e country where -- a few will always go, for money, you know, but that\u2122s a small percentage . And then they got mad, and they said okay, you didn\u2122t come when we invited you, now it\u2122s forced labor. And every male between 16 and 45 had to go, except from the Catholic church, a priest, and from the Protestant church, the pastor s, and some teachers didn\u2122t ha ve to go, but a bunch had to go, because what they did, the people didn\u2122t go, and then they surrounded, for instance, a high school. Now, there are always boys of 16 - 17. So they went in the morning happily to school and never came home, they were sent to Germany. And the universities were all in that age group, so they were surrounded, and we had many Jewish professors, they have brains, and they were very beloved, and they were kicked out of their jobs, they weren\u2122t allowed to have their jobs any more, so their student s went on strike, and all -- they were -- so all the students, if they were -- they surrounded the university, and they were -- so then everything closed. And so only girls went to school, and the university were closed, also out of protest, strike. So some of the teachers had to go to -- and then they still didn\u2122t want to go, so a lot -- just think that in America, every male between 16 and 45 has to go in hiding, and that\u2122s what happened. And they went in hiding, but a small group didn\u2122t know where to go, mostly so mewhere in your circle of family or friends, there is somebody where you can go and hide. But those guys couldn\u2122t come in the street any more, because you didn\u2122t know if you saw a young man or a woman that they were Gestapo, so they we re -- they really had to go in hiding. But the thing was, because nobody went to Germany to work ther e, in the fields -- there was hunger in Germany, and they loaded in all the countries the trains full, and the food went all to Germany, and we had very little. So they started a ration system with coupons, I have some in my -- you probably have seen them. But anyway -- but the only way you got the coupons, and they lasted a month -- it was about a card this size, and it was so little, a German guy with an appetite wouldn\u2122t even have anything to eat. And it was very little, but you only got it when you went to those offices. And there were Dutch people working but the supervision all was kicked out, a nd all replaced by Germans. And you only got your new card -- your new sou -- coupons if you showed your I.D. So those young men between 16 and 45 never could get coupons again. And the farmers, because you know in [indecipherable] they helped their own group, they did not help others, really, only the dental family -- the dentist family. But many, Corrie ten Boom, were hiding Jewish people, and many groups were hiding, ma ny. Catholics, and Protestants, and Communists, everybody. So, but those guys -- the farmers had already -- who dared to, had taken Jews, but then we had to go to villages and cities and say, will you take a Dutch guy. And that was considered less dangerous than taking a Jewish person. But they told us we can\u2122t, because we know they don\u2122t get ration cards, and my own kid is asking for another slice of bread we can\u2122t give him, and a potato. We can\u2122t feed an extra mouth. If you don\u2122t have ration cards, then they don\u2122t get it. And then from some other group, you know, at that time -- now people travel, but at that time, if a farmer and his wife lived here, and they had two sons, then they got farms close by. They all stayed close by. And nobody traveled, and all the mail they got might have been a bank statement, and a per -- something of their church, but they didn\u2122t ge t any other mail. And here we also made a big mistake, we put a father and mother here , and a son there, and a daughter there, and they started writing each other. And that wa s for the mailman who delivered it, and the 39 second letter, or the third letter, you have somebody here? And that was suspicious. And then, this was big news, there was no television at that time, the radio was va -- so Farmer so and so gets all the time mail, so th en they maybe think, do you have somebody, you get all the time mail, I hear from the ma ilman.

            "question": "Some of the farmers were arrested?",
            "answer": "Yeah, because they had also a side -- see they -- we had such a well registered country, every family in every village, in wherever you lived, had a card system in every town hall. And if a baby was born, the father had to go to the town hall, and say there\u2122s a new baby, this name and that and that, and that went in a card system. And if somebody died, you had to go, a card was taken out. If a whole family moved to another city, that -- you had to report it, and the whole -- but that card system, at th at time -- now they can\u2122t do it any more, but everything was on it. Your faith, your religion, your job, your whatever you were, your age. So they had all the Jewish fing -- on their fingertips, that they knew exactly how many Jews we had. And of course, then they saw that they were not showing up in the amount they had to show up, so th ey got mad. And everyw here, like -- with -- for the labor, there were signs, if you help a Jew, you -- you will be treated as a Jew. So then the farmers -- and some were betrayed because of the mail, and they got scared, because the I.D.s, the identific ation cards that we all had to have the end of \u212244, the beginning of \u212241, that had a big, fat, black J printed on it, too. And they had gone to the farms with this thing, and then the farmers came to us, and they said, Diet -- or, I had fal - the false name then, \ufb01Diet, can you get us I.D.s without a J, be -- if there ever is a raid on our farm, that we can say, we didn\u2122t know they were Jewish, we thought they were city people who were hungry, came here fo r being -- for better food.\ufb02 And then the people in the city said, \ufb01We will take the Du tch guys if you had ration cards.\ufb02 And then we were in a bind, because you know, by that time, I think we had hidden about 80 Jewish people all over. And this -- the farmers were scared. We got together, we were a real small group, and we knew all each othe r from long ago, and we were a Christian group, and we went on our knees, and we prayed to God, and we had -- Lord, we can\u2122t just now say good luck and find your own way. We have to go on, but now we don\u2122t know what to do any more. And I remember I always was jealous of Moses, he got a manna from he -- and he got water from the rock, but the heavens did not open, and we did not get a whole bunch of cards. And then the only way to get it was to take it, because, you know, there was no other way out, and it was really life and death for those people. So then, after praying, it became clear to us, we had to do a robbery on the German offices. Until that time, if you treated -- helped a Jew, you were treated as a Jew, but if you did a robbery on the German office, that was the death penalty. And when I speak for high schools, or universities, I always say when I say this, \ufb01This is not advice kids,\ufb02 I said, \ufb01but if you do an ar -- a robbery, you better have arms, and revolvers.\ufb02 And th-the British had, over our lakes, dumped at night, you know, big containers full of -- we had weapons, the resistance, but having a weapon was the death penalty. So then it really became dangerous, and there were a few brav e guys that were called the knockploegs, k-n-o-c-k ploeg. And they volunteered to do that, every month again. And we found always a village, or a somewhere, where we knew somebody was working, sa -- a Dutch person 40 was good, and that we can make a dra -- a dr awing, where are the guards [indecipherable] a guard, how many, is -- how is it locked, you know, that they had to shoot it open.

And Hein wrote me a letter, and he said, be Saturday night at that and that farm, and I then I think I told you this morning that went to church together, and then we had dinner at that leader -- the other leader, there were two, and he was a farmer, so they got up in the morning and they wanted to take a nap. And then Hein said, We -- we going on a bike ride, and it was beautiful spring weather, and all the fruit trees had their pink blossoms. And we were alone on that, and Hein pulled his Bible out, and he read from John 14, and that is in my Father\u2122s house, I have many mansions, and I don\u2122t know, I still remember that. And then he told me everything about the work, becau se I knew only my little part, and I didn\u2122t want to know more, because I thought, if you are arrested, and they start torturing you, you can\u2122t say I\u2122ll keep my mouth shut, you can\u2122t say that. And I -- but he said -- I said, \ufb01Hein, don\u2122t tell me, I don\u2122t want to know wh at the others do.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Somebody has to know the whole thing,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01for in case that Ab or I,\ufb02 -- and I listened to him, and then he brought me that evening to the farm of Alie, and we were alone on that country road, and there was nothing, only those beautiful trees that are in the distance. And I heard clearly a voice, and I s -- can\u2122t explain it. And that voice said in Dutch to me, Kijk nog mar goed n aar hem. That\u2122s in English, have a good look at him. And I thought this is ridiculous, that is a thought that comes in my head, but I heard it again, twice. And then I started looking at him, and he was far over six feet, so I 64 [indecipherable] and I looked up, and he started laughing. He said, \ufb01What are you staring at me?\ufb02 And I didn\u2122t dare to tell him, and I said, \ufb01Nothing.\ufb02 And he brought me to the farm, and that was the last time I saw him. A nd three days later he was in Friesland, and he was inspected in the train like many peopl e, but men especially. And they saw that he was a pastor, so he was safe. But then they searched him, and they found a lot of stuff what he had there. So he was put in a prison. But we felt -- and I -- you saw those coupons, and those I.D.s, those identification cards. And when we stole them, if that was found in a large quantity, you got shot. I mean, th at was the end of your life. So we felt, all the farmers, and the people who gave us a bed, were already ru-r unning a risk. It could be that three in the night there\u2122s the doorbell, and they look for us. So we always had to find a way out, in the back door or through a window, but you know where we would go. But we did not want to bring all this danger stuff in those homes, because it could be that I could get out, but that the papers stayed there, and that the people would be shot. So we had rented a P.O. box somewhere, and Hein smuggled a note out, because we wrote each other, and then we gave the letters to others , and keep them till after the war. But the last letter we always kept, it was kind of, you know, close to our heart. "

And the underground hated the Dutch people, especially the police who stay ed and worked for the Germans. And sometimes by the -- by the Communists they were killed. Those adulterators, they helped the Germans. But this guy had stayed to help. And for some reas on or another, that Hein smuggled that note out via this guy, and i -- it came via, via, via, through lots of searching, and underground did that -- man delivered it to the underground, and they found Ab, the other leader. And then it said, \ufb01Empty the P.O. box, and don\u2122t us e it any more,\ufb02 because he had a key, and he would be afraid that he will be tortured, and if the other kept on sending, that would be heavy for him, with his hearing. And he said, \ufb01And let Diet take another name, they know now her false name.\ufb02 So then they were looking twice for me, my real name, and this name. So it was getting -- the net was getting closer. And then he said, And let her warn all the guys, and then bring the documents fr om the -- from the thing to The Hague, and he mentioned a nickname that we called this guy. And so I knew what he meant. So I got my other pe -- identification card again, and then the man asked me what name do you want to have now, because he had made so many. So I says, \ufb01Well, the name of our queen, Wilhemina,\ufb02 and then I just heard th e name Laarman -- Laarman. And then he 65 said, \ufb01Where do you want to be born?\ufb02 And th ere was no time to put one in that town hall anywhere, and then you had to smudge it. I sa ys well, make it Surinam, Paramibo is the capital, and that\u2122s Dutch territory, and they can \u2122t check that, there was no mail there, they were free. So -- and then he said, \ufb01Wha t job?\ufb02 And that was a problem, because I couldn\u2122t say secretary, because if they said where do you work, there was no Willie Laarman, I couldn\u2122t say nurse, I couldn\u2122t say t eacher. So I said maid. And there was an elderly couple in there, had said, \ufb01We would love to help, but we don\u2122t know how, we are so old.\ufb02 So I went to them, I said, \ufb01Now you can help. If I am arrested, you vouch that I am your maid.\ufb02 And they said okay. So I wa s the maid Willie Laarman. And then I had all that stuff from the -- from the thing on my -- in an envelope in my blouse, and I had warned all the guys, and I had lunch with one of them, in Zwijndrecht, and then I had to go to The Hague, and that was a short trip, only one stop in Rotterdam, and they -- this was in May \u212244, they had -- were a whole year looking for me already, and the Gestapo still coming to our house, so they had never given up. And then it turned out -- and that was so terrible, because normally if they t hought you help Jews they came four or five times, and then they thought -- there were so many, then they gave up, but they never gave up. And we had a spy in the headquarters of the Gestapo that was -- and he worked for us, and he looked in our files, and he found out that Mies had kept a diary, and they had found that diary, and in it said Toos brought 27 ration cards. Toos brought 27 I.D.s. Toos -- and Hein had been there also, but not so often because he wa s in other parts. And he had given the name Dick. Dick did this, Dick -- so they were looking for Toos and Dick that they knew were doing the robberies, or part of the robberies. And that Jewish deal wasn\u2122t even important for them, they want ed that, that\u2122s why they never gave up for two years. So we knew that they knew ever ything about us. But they didn\u2122t know who Toos was. And then I found out that that Bram had been there, and Bram had been, not too long before that married, and his bride wa s crying his ide -- her eyes out. And later I heard that she paid the Gestapo 5000 guilders. And they told him, you go to Germany, and your bride is crying at home. And then, I have no proof, but he was the only one who knew who the phone number was, so he gave the phone number to the Gestapo, and he was freed soon after that. But I\u2122ve never seen him, and I -- I don\u2122t know, the guy started out good, that he wanted to help Jews, so I didn\u2122t want to make a big fuss out of that. And I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s in the book, he\u2122s now -- I heard that he died. I checked later out, and I didn\u2122t want to go there, because I thought if he knows what that mentioning of that phone, for -- had for results, he would live this terrible remorse or something, so I\u2122ve never made any. But he was the only one who knew my phone number."

But everybody 14 and over had to go and get that I.D., so in the beginning we had I thi nk about nine million inhabitants, and a lot -- millions over 14, so they had handed out millions . And after that -- that was in the end \u212240 -- beginning of \u212241, they handed out to everybody who turned 14, then you had to go. And in \u212243, they ran -- ran out, they had no more. And they printed exactly the same, everything, except those to -- two little words nationality Dutch, instead of deep purple, in black. And if you don\u2122t know it, you could barely see it. And I had one of the last robbery, and it was a black one, so that was printed in \u212243, but the guy who made the false papers, wrote automatically I think \u212242 or something. If he had done a duplicate that I\u2122d lost it \u212243, I would have been okay. But on that I was arrested, and later that man from the government, he said, \ufb01Oh, you had a black -- you had a black nationality.\ufb02 He said so many were arrested.

But they were wal -- waiting for [indecipherable] because they were doing raids in The Hague, and arresting people, probably Jewish people.

And he could speak Dutch, and I remember that in that car he says to me, \ufb01Yeah, now I can\u2122t help you, you\u2122re a young girl, and I feel so sorry that you go to prison now, but you didn\u2122t tell any, now you have to go to prison,\ufb02 he said. \ufb01But if you still tell me how you got this paper,\ufb02 he says, \ufb01then you get very special pr -- treatment in -- in the prison. You get -- may choose every day what you want to eat, and you get every time with your meal a glass of wine.\ufb02 And I thought, how stupid does he think I am? I -- I knew definitely that wasn\u2122t true. I mean, how stupid? So I just played along, and I said, \ufb01Yeah, real -- really?\ufb02 And you know, in Dutch? And he says yes. I said, \ufb01May I even choose appelmoes?\ufb02 Was applesauce, and that\u2122s -- it\u2122s such a stupid word, appelmoes, and I thought that he would then realize.

And he gave me a whack. But then I was brought in, and he disappeared, and I had to stand for a long time in a corridor, and on one side are all cells. And I had to face the wall, and stood there for a long time, and out of the cells I heard all voices, and they said, \ufb01What is the news from the outside world, what is the news from the outside world?\ufb02 But I didn\u2122t know if these were Gestapo guys who wanted to check, so I -- I feel always guilty, because if they were real prisoners, I thought I should have told, but I didn\u2122t want to take the chance. And then they brought me, it had many corridors, A, B, C, D, and I was in corridor A, in cell six, some that -- the handkerchief, I think it was six or eight. And they put me in, and it was three meter, now that\u2122s a little bit longer than three yards, and two meter, right? And it had -- I didn\u2122t know that -- a drum in the corner, and only one cot, and it was meant for one person, so small. And very high window with bars. And I was number five, there were four others. And there was an old Jewish lady, Mrs. Spire, and she had the cot, and we slept on stone, on the floor. It -- it was a prison for criminals, so I didn\u2122t know what are the other women, you know, they could be criminals, they c ould be [indecipherable] they could be anything, but the Jewish lady I knew was okay. And I had been the whole day in the he train, telling all the guys, and I had been si tting at that station, and then in the headquarters of the Gestapo, and then I had to go so urgent bathroom, so I said to those ladies, how -- \ufb01What do you do? I have to go bathroom?\ufb02 And I thought that they say, 73 well you have to go -- knock at the door and then they bring you to a toilet. And they turned around, and they pointed at this little drum. And I -- you know -- that this was the time now you go camping, and women shower to gether, and there is no -- but this was 1944, and everything was so proper. And I thought, I\u2122m not going on a thing with those women that I\u2122ve never seen. But you know, I coul dn\u2122t hold it until after the war, so at one point my pride went out of the window, and I had to go on the tippultum, and that\u2122s what it was called. Oh goody."

So you ha d to prepare yourself for being shot. And I know that several -- there were so many, there were 1800 I heard later. So we were in loads of trucks. And some of The Hague people were so scared they jumped out, and there were soldiers sitting with machine gun -- with mi -- mitarios machine guns, I think 76 you called it. There was no point, a-and I don\u2122t know, we have dunes in Michigan the Great Bear dunes, you can\u2122t run in dunes, it\u2122s sand, and it goes up, there was no way, it wasn\u2122t practical, so we went there. But then later my father told me -- he was born in 1883, that when there were no cars yet, and th ere were a couple of very expensive hotels, one was the Oranje Hotel, the Orange Hote l, and development people came to the big station, and for those people, there were no cars yet, and they -- they didn\u2122t have any suitcases, especially not this [indecipherable ], they had big trunks for [indecipherable]. So they had made a side branch with a little train that came to flu -- near the hotels.

So they avoided that, and they brought us there in the dunes, so we were not shot, we were loaded in trains.

And then the train was also black, when -- you know, curtains, that not a light shown, and we didn\u2122t know where we were going.

And if we stay in the Netherlands, and in the south you had a -- a Vught, and in the middle you had Amersfoort, Camp Amersfoort. So we didn\u2122t know where we were going, it was dark and all the curtains were down, it was night.

And then oh, she comes back, and what do I say, and if she\u2122s engaged to a German -- who is engaged to a German during this time? So I was really scared. And then I had heard that Mrs. Verschoor had lived there, and we all had diarrhea bouts, and then you were allowed -- they were allowed to leave their paper stuff, and I had to go.

And I said, \ufb01Is there also a dentist?\ufb02 They said, \ufb01Y eah, there\u2122s also a dentist.\ufb02 And by that time we had all had our prison dresses, and if you had had a hearing it was navy blue, gray, navy blue, gray, and it had pockets. And if you had had your hearing, then you were classified, and you got a triangle, and you probably know about that, but when you were a political prisoner you got a red triangle. If you were a murderer you had a green triangle, if you were gay you had a pink triangle, and I think the Jehovah Witnesses had silver, gray, or something. But that was af ter your hearing. And Corrie and Betsie had already been called out. And so I heard that there was a dentist, and I asked permission -- a boring life, you know, every day the same, a nd we were hardly ever marching, because we weren\u2122t allowed to go outside. And so th en I said, \ufb01Could I go to the dentist?\ufb02 And with eight other prisoners, we were brought by a soldier with a machine gun to the 83 dentist. So we walked through that camp, and it was in a little building that was -- I think next to the hospital, but I didn\u2122t know, we came through a door. And we had eight of us to sit on a bench, and I saw that the dentist had a green triangle, and he was a Greek, but he spoke fluent English. And he -- and he had a green triangle, so he was a murderer, but I thought, well, maybe he has killed a Germa n, and then you know, for me he is a good mur-murderer, yeah. It\u2122s terrible that I say that, but you know, you didn\u2122t know what -- so anyway, it was my turn, and I -- but this city where this Camp Vught was so close to the Philips factories, and all the young men had b een sent to Germany, and the top guys, who were necessary, they had been exemptioned to go to Germany. But they said to the Germans, we need Dutch people -- we need pe ople to work here, we need laborers to do the work, why don\u2122t you send some busloads of those prisoners every day? And then they were fed terrific by those Dutch guys, and Philips makes radios, there was no TV yet, so the Germans couldn\u2122t constantly watch, so thos e prisoners who worked there, they loved it, they got food from the Dutch, and if any of the German was gone, they put the BBC on, so they heard all the latest news. And they told it in the camps, so that dentist knew all the latest news. So it was my turn, and he starts drilling, and he said, \ufb01Would you like to know the latest news?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes, please.\ufb02 So he told me they were marching up at Italy, and it was going so good for us, so there was hope, you know. And then when my turn was over -- he did the temporarily filling in it, so I had to sit back on that bench, and the next one -- but that German had to watch us , but also the dentist and the patient, so he was slowly walking up and down, and up and down. And I was sitting at the corner, and here was a door. And the door started slamming. And that\u2122s such an irritating noise, so I closed it [indecipherable] and a moment la ter it was slamming again, and I thought, that is not coincident, so I kept my eye on it, and when the German had gone this, and was with his back to door -- the door opens a little slight, and a ha nd came up, so high piled with bread, much nicer bread than we had outside. And was margarine on it. So I grabbed it, but the German could come back, so what do you do? I gave all the girls one, and was no time to eat, so it goes here, that\u2122s wher e you stuff everything. And then the German walked again, and the hand came again, and we went in [indecipherable] and we went back to the barrack [indecipherable] dow n, and it was really funny. And we knew the news. So the next time -- the temporary, he did that three or four times, and then he said, \ufb01Now I have to put a real one in.\ufb02 And I was so sorry, I thought no news, no bread, because we shared it with those eight girls, especially w-we thought were going to die."

            "answer": "And I was so sad, and he says to me, \ufb01But I can drill a hole in a good one,\ufb02 and he said, \ufb01I won\u2122t touch a nerve.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes, please.\ufb02 And he did several of my good ones, and I was there for weeks. And you won\u2122t believe this -- so then in the end, I think that he was -- and we heard heavy artillery in the distance, and that was your general -- we didn\u2122t know it was, but we knew they were our friends the liberators. And the Nazis got terrible nervous, and these were our friends, and they didn\u2122t want anybody of this camp ever to be liberated. And then they started, every sunset my barrack was right on the edge of the camp, and there was water, and they said th ere was electricity so you can\u2122t escape, and they said there is a mine field. And then you had that fence with the towers and machine guns, and then there were the woods. And the machine guns were every time at sunset, 84 and it was in the woods close by that we could hear it. And one day I\u2122m doing the laundry, and there were two clothes -- and all clothes, and it was covered with blood. And one woman from the guards -- I remember it, you were never alone, and you longed to be alone for a moment, and think and pray. And I had to clean the little room where the guards were always sitting, and there was a [indecipherable] and I was very softly humming a -- a hymn that was really consoli ng to me, and this woman came in. And she could have yelled at me, because you weren\u2122 t allowed to sing. And she said to me, and that\u2122s German again, I have to spell it, \ufb01Sie singen wie ein Heidelarche.\ufb02 You sing like a heather lark. And I was really sad, and I didn\u2122t have a beautiful voice, but I knew that she was not the cruelest, you know, she had some soft. And she was just on duty, so -- and she could speak a little bit Dutch, they all coul d. So I said to her, \ufb01What is this, all this blood?\ufb02 And you know, I had to soak it, and bl ood has to go in cold water, in troughs where we had to wash ourself. And it was horrible. And she said, \ufb01[indecipherable] two guys who have been on a motorbike, they had an accident, in the hospital, and they come out and need their clothes,\ufb02 so I washed them. Two days later, I got 12 sets of bloody underwear and clothes. And that whole 12 was filled with blood, and all the 12, and I thought this is not just something. So I went to that spy, and they all did kind of pitiful to me, they thought you\u2122re a border case, you\u2122re no t all [indecipherable], and they said -- Hanny Janssen was her name. I said, \ufb01Hanny, I ha ve to wash all clothes, you know, that -- that\u2122s hard to do every day, but now it\u2122s all bloody. What would that be?\ufb02 I did real stupid. She said, \ufb01Oh, that are guys who are, every sunset when you hear the machine guys, are executed. They are traitors.\ufb02 And it were our Dutch guys. And you know, they dragged you from one camp to another. And the next day I got 36 of those bloody clothes, and that trough was filled with Dutch blood. It was so horrible. And I didn\u2122t know if Hein had been brought [indecipherable] Ab and I started to look always when I had to wash those clothes, for names. And I was shattered, and I don\u2122t know, I -- I cracked up, because also we had buried weapons in my parents house, under the roses, under the bushes, and I didn\u2122t know anything. I thought, if they all the time come and search, and they dig up the yard, and they find the weapons, they\u2122ve shot my parents. I really -- I thought my -- I thought I was abso lutely going crazy, I didn\u2122t know any more. And if I didn\u2122t have my faith, I would have -- I was -- I cracked up. I was -- the next morning I couldn\u2122t get up, I was paralyzed for three days. And they sent the camp doctor, and he kicked the bed, he said, \ufb01There\u2122s nothing wrong with you.\ufb02 But I was so weak that then they don\u2122t me -- me -- they didn\u2122t make me do the laundry any more, they gave me a broomstick, and I had to sweep. And then I started hating them so much, you know. We say I hate this, or I thi -- old President Bush hated broccoli. And I think you don\u2122t know what hated is. With every molecule in my body, hated those Nazis for what they were doing. And I was so angry with God. I thought, you are there in heaven, these are your people that they\u2122re killing. They\u2122re killing my people, and you can stop this, and you don\u2122t do a thing. And I was praying God\u2122s damnation on the whole bunch. I was still praying, but I was praying horrible prayers, only God\u2122s damnation. God [indecipherable] this or that. And just then, there was one girl that I -- I said I trusted too, apart from Mrs. Verschoor, and her name was Freddy, and Freddy was a Catholic. And just in all this stuff that you heard, that was your General Patton, who was getting closer, and closer by -- and just in [indecipherable] of my hearing, and I had -- al l those months I had trouble with you may not give false witness, it was one of the things what was in the Bible, a 85 story of a spy, Rayhab, and she lied, and she was not punished by God, but she was blessed [indecipherable] Jesus. So when I t hought of that, because I knew the Bible from that -- I thought, oh that\u2122s God permission, so I said, oh let -- okay lord, I consider that I have your permission to lie, and now give me a good story. And for months I was praying if they had interrogated me then, I wouldn\u2122t know what to say. But every day I\u2122d work on that story when I went to bed. And I was born -- I thought, as little ballast as you can have. So you have a father, no he has died. You have a mother? She has died. No brothers and sisters. Because if you -- three months later, I didn\u2122t kn ow how long I would have to say it, you have to tell the story exactly the same, the same dates. So it was really a matter of life and death. And just when this all happened, I had my story ready, but I was repeating it every night, you know, because sometimes they shook you up at two in the night, and you had the hearing that -- in your sleep, or half asleep you may say the wrong thing. And Freddy saw that I was called out for my hearing, and she knew that was life or death for everybody, except for this Hanny Janssen, and the officer from the Gestapo came for the hearing, had to sign me out. And she pretended that she had diarrhea, and she stormed from her twine making, past me, and while he was signing me out she whispered in my ear. I\u2122m going to storm th e gates of heaven for you. And you know, me -- I say to friends, I\u2122ll pray for you, but this was so much stronger, I don\u2122t know if you know that story -- the gay guard at -- that comic, you know, you see him with a ram going. And you know something, another second miracle happened apart from the rain coat. I walked out with that man, and we ha d to walk maybe eight minutes, or 10 minutes to the main building of the hearings. And b ecause I knew the Bible, and I was bombarded with God\u2122s promises. And one of them is, not a har -- hair of your head will be harmed without the will of your heavenly father. So th ey couldn\u2122t even touch a hair of my head without Him. And the second one is somethi ng that you don\u2122t need every time, but it said also, do not fear be -- if you have to appear before authorities and kings, I will give you the words. God promised me. And I said, okay Lord -- like Tevye on this \ufb01Fiddler on the Roof,\ufb02 you know, he was always talking to God, I said, \ufb01I have broken many promises, but this is a promise, and I hold you to your word. But you just have to give me the words.\ufb02 And I walked in that building, and in that room, and there were a whole bunch of Nazi -- very high Nazis sitting behind the table, S.S.\u2122s. I knew their ranks, and I saw their medals. I think about seven at a green table. And I told you about the bad food we had, one slice of bread in the morning, one in the evening, and that was [indecipherable], then the line leaves. But once a month we got a package from the Red Cross, and that has a sandwich, and that had a little bit of toilet paper, and it had a square inch of pure lard. And they had put some soy sauce in, so we sc rape every day a bit of that. But because of that bad food, we had all gotten phlegmones, I don\u2122t know if you know what that -- people in the first World War in the ditches in Belgium and France had it. It started as an itch, and then you got hives, and then they became so big like strawberries, and you always had them in your face. And your whole face was out of shape, and in the end your skin couldn\u2122t hold it any more, and it burst open, and green pus was dripping down. And we all had that on our faces, most of us, a nd it was terrible. And then it was the fifth month, I\u2122ve never had shampoo, so can you imagin e your hair greasy, just cold water, no towels. And we looked a mess, and we have no mirrors, but you saw how the others -- so there I was sitting with those seven well fed guys across from me, and 15 minutes before, I\u2122d wished them all death. And I looked at them, and I thought, there you sit, you seven, 86 and you think that you can decide about my life. You can\u2122t even touch a hair of my head if God doesn\u2122t let you. And I thought you totally on the wrong side, the -- and actually, the most strange thing, I could feel pity for them. They though t they had it all, and they had nothing. And then they ask -- started asking me questions, but stup id really had done so stupid in those months, and I\u2122d never said one gerd of German, one word. So I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t know what you\u2122re saying.\ufb02 So they called the translator, and he had to sit there, then they asked him the questions, but I knew it already, and then me, so it gave me twice the time to think. And then in the end, the lead er -- he had the highest rank, and he was in his 50\u2122s, and he said, \ufb01I have done nothing in my life but hearings, and I have developed a sixth sense,\ufb02 he says, \ufb01and I can\u2122t,\ufb02 -- and I was so afraid that I had slipped up somewhere, you know, because it was very importa nt. But he said, \ufb01I can\u2122t put a pin in your story, [indecipherable],\ufb02 -- he said, \ufb01but my sixth sens e tells me it\u2122s all baloney.\ufb02 And I told him, because they said I was early 20 , so my father must have been in his 40\u2122s. And they said, \ufb01What did your father there? \ufb02 I thought everywhere before I thought a -- taxes. I said, \ufb01He worked for the taxes,\ufb02 b ecause that\u2122s everywhere, in every country, you know. And then he said, \ufb01Where is he?\ufb02 I said he died, but of course he must have been young. He said, \ufb01What did he die of?\ufb02 I said he was bitten by a snake. [indecipherable]. And then they asked me the date, and they have the big Sinter Klass on December five, so my father had died on December five. A nd then, and your mother? She has died, too. I -- I felt like I was killing my own parents. And they said, \ufb01What di d she die of?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01She had a very weak heart, and when Father was brought home there, she died.\ufb02 \ufb01When?\ufb02 \ufb0110 days later, 15 th,\ufb02 so I thought I could rememb er that. So they asked all questions, but then in the end they starte d -- and I heard every word, they started discussing my case in front of them. And they said, \ufb01But she doesn\u2122t look like a maid, she looks more like a secretary, or a teacher.\ufb02 And then I heard another one say, \ufb01Well, we can check that.\ufb02 And I thought, how can you ever check -- I -- I had no idea what it was. And then they brought me -- see, that was th e good thing, that I -- that they thought I didn\u2122t know German. And then they brought me a magazine and a pad, and a pencil, and said, \ufb01Copy that.\ufb02 And I thought -- I think your brains work 200 percent when you\u2122re -- it was life or death again. And I thought, why are they with this? And then it dawned on me, when you were a maid, by law you had to go through sixth grade, and then you could go, and mostly you were from poor families, a nd you were farmed out to a wealthy lady where -- or couple, that you had to have the etic -- but you don\u2122t write, you write -- and we had one hour, and some schools two hour s of penmanship. And if you see those classrooms, the capital A, the small a, the ca -- so that is what your handwriting was when you leave. But if you\u2122re a secretary, and you take dictation, you start -- so I thought, that is the trap they put up for me. So I sat there, and I hold [indecipherable] with my tongue sticking out like it was rea lly unusual work. And then they brought me back to the barrack. And then the noise of the a-allies came sh -- all the time closer, and they got more and more nervous. And then I remembered one of the women one time says to me -- I was called Willie. \ufb01Willie, if you can choose what day you go out of prison, what would you choose?\ufb02 And I says, \ufb01 If I would choose, I want to go in the radiant sunshine, when the world looks so happy.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01On a Saturday morning, and take a soak bath, and shampoo, and take ca re of all that stuff on my face, clean underwear, clean clothes, and Sunday go to church and thank God for freedom,\ufb02 I said, \ufb01with capital letters. We always take it for grante d, but it\u2122s a gift.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01But if it pours, 87 and it\u2122s Monday morning, I\u2122ll go too.\ufb02 And you know, this is so miraculous, two weeks later, on a radiant Saturday morning, I wa s called out by the Hauptmachtmeisterin, she was the highest, and she was a real m ean woman. And she\u2122s, \ufb01Willie, you\u2122ll go to Germany.\ufb02 And the little voice here said, \ufb01Y ou\u2122re going home.\ufb02 And that\u2122s when I put the belt on, and I left sweaters I had with th e eight girls, and I knew in my heart I was going out. And I was let out with another girl, Ansje. And Ansje didn\u2122t know it, but her husband had been executed. And Ansje, when we had to stand at attention, you know, had always fainted the first. And she was married for eight or nine years, and they wanted so much to have a baby, and in the camp sh e found out she was pregnant, so she fainted all the time. And her husband didn\u2122t know it, but he had been executed. But when she was let out she didn\u2122t know she was a widow. And they let us out at the total different gate than where they had brought us in. And there we stood. And they had been so cruel with many things. They once said to me that I could take a shower in Scheveningen, and then I was there, and I hadn\u2122t had any water -- I mean, that little pail with cold water, and when I stood there, and I\u2122d undressed, and I wanted to [indecipherable] ready, I\u2122d never [indecipherable]. So they did all cruel things to make you happy for something, and they\u2122d -- so we were afraid that the ga tes would open again and say, \ufb01Okay, all a big mistake, back in.\ufb02 And we wanted to get aw ay, but we were so [indecipherable] nervous. And there was nothing. It was a lot of sand, it was very arid, and in the distance were trees but you saw two wheels from a cart, a nd you saw some horse manure. And this was the end of \u212244, and [indecipherable] our whole country does nothing any more. If you saw a store, there wouldn\u2122t be a rubber band, there wouldn\u2122t be a paper clip, there wouldn\u2122t be anything. And the farmers didn\u2122t get fertilizer, and this is an arid part, so they collected all the manure from their pigs , their chickens, their cows, from everything, and it went in a pit, and then they pumped it up, and they put it in the moving cart, and spread it over the field, and they did that regularly. So they never scrubbed that cart wi -- for a few days later they filled it again. But this was the end of \u212244, so you can -- and we saw -- where we were standing there, and we said, shall we go left or right, we want to get away from here, but we didn\u2122t want to walk miles for nothing, you know, so we -- and then we saw a little dot. We said, \ufb01Let\u2122s see what that is.\ufb02 So we started walking, and it was a farmer who was going to spread all th at manure, and that cart was filled to the brim with you know what, and stinking, and he was walking next to it because there was a shelf or something, that -- where you coul d sit on behind the horse, but it was caked on everywhere. And he was walking next to his horse. And he\u2122s, \ufb01Hi girls, you just came out of the camp?\ufb02 And we said yes. And he didn\u2122t know if he should offer us a ride because then we had to sit on that dried stuff. And he said, would you -- would you -- but [indecipherable] it was a Cadillac, and we sa id, \ufb01Yes, please.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Hop on.\ufb02 And I think that was such a glorious exit out of that prison, and the concentration camp, on the top of a manure cart. And I think like [indecipherable] God in heaven was having a little fun, that he had [indecipherable]"

And they got long strips, and they have to dump that in the water in strips, and then wind it. And they had every day to do 60 meters [indecipherable] little bit, I think 70 yards or so. And that was then dried, and when it was dry it was rolled in rolls, and they sold it as twine. And then I was arrested in the train, and I had only the one panty on, I had no other clothes, so one time the elastic off my panty broke, and at that time it was -- the elas tic was like through a loop, you know -- now they stitch it on, but that wasn\u2122t then. So there I was, and I had no panty. So I said to the girls who were making that twin e, \ufb01Can you bring me some of that?\ufb02 And I wind it, and that\u2122s stiff and hard and I can get it through and tie it. So they did, but they brought me so much. But -- and there was nothin g, so that was very precious, and then I had done that with my panty, and I thought wh at can I do with the rest? And there were eight girls that I thought they won\u2122t get out, they won\u2122t survive. They were so sick, and TB, and everything. That were also the eight that we gave that bread to. And I thought, you know what, I\u2122m going to their parents. I had deep down the feeling one day I will -- I have those crazy fore-feelings, you know? And I had the feeling, you will get out, you will get out. So I asked them where do you liv e? And I wrote all the eight addresses 92 down, and their names. And then I made it s lightly wet, and I wound it, but I had so much, so I didn\u2122t want to have it just as one -- so then, I think without knowing it, I might have done the first macram\u00e9. And I made this belt, it was in August \u212244, I would say. But how do you close it? So then I did those loops, and one a bit smaller than the other one. And out of somebody\u2122s socks, we -- I pulled w ool, and then -- so when I was let out, I had this around my waist, and I was planning to go to all those eight parents, they lived in different cities. But I had all the addresses in my head, so I never had to open it. So this is the real thing. But you know, it\u2122s paper, and now it\u2122s getting too dry. The other day I wet it just a little bit, but it\u2122s breaking here, and I feel so bad. But really, I think 60 years later, it must have bleached up, but the names should still be in here. But I still know several. Randy Polner was one of them."

            "answer": "-- because see, Corrie ten Boom, Corrie and Betsie were -- had the hearing, and then you went to the other camp, and that was much easier. We were not allowed anything. And there Corrie and Betsie [indecipherable] some months you were allowed to write, it was censored, and then some mon-months you were allowed to receive mail. You could receive one package a month. And you had a working day, but when it was over, you were allowed outside in the camps, free to visi t others, in other barracks. Now, we were never -- we were now and then marched through a little street, up down, up down, that was all -- and then back, because we were really the ones who hadn\u2122t had a hearing. And I did another terrible thing, that Hanny Janssen, the traitor, I heard from somebody -- yeah, I have to tell this too, because it\u2122s re ally hilarious. I heard that she was really a prostitute, and she had started an affair with one of those SS\u2122s on the corner, a young, handsome guy, Hans. And somebody told me, \ufb01H anny climbs out of the barrack late, out of window, and then she\u2122s the whole night with this Hans, [indecipherable] and then towards the morning she climbs back.\ufb02 And then -- and she was a prisoner, and we had to stand appel. And then they came back, and th e man in charge of the appel -- you had the week that you were the stubealteste, that\u2122s the outchder from the -- in time then. So one time it was my turn to be stubealteste, and [i ndecipherable] I have a real mean streak in me, and I\u2122m not sorry for it. And anyway, when I heard that, I said to the girl who told me, I said, I know something. So then when it was my turn in the morning to tell the guards who locked us up and went away then by that time, they weren\u2122t day and night with us any more, but the guards were there. And I locked all the windows from the 93 barrack. And Hanny wanted to climb in in th e morning, and she couldn\u2122t, there was no window open. And then she had to disappear in the woods, because, you know, she [indecipherable] missing, but she was a prisoner . So then -- and they all thought that I was so stupid, so then the guards came in and they had to say hundred sev -- 185 prisoners, eight in bed, and so many. And then you had to say who were sick or new sick ones. And I said -- and I did real stupid, I said, \ufb01I know there should be 175 women, but I can only count 174, but I\u2122m probably wrong.\ufb02 But they started counting, and she was missing. And then it was daylight, so she c ouldn\u2122t come back. And then oh, there was -- and she was missing. And then later, the rumo r went Hanny Janssen had tried to escape, but that wasn\u2122t true, and she had to go a month to the bunker, so we were a month without her, and she never knew who -- but then after the war, two guys from the -- from the ger -- from our police came when I wa s studying nursing, and they came to the hospital where I worked, and they were from the -- the political police, you know, who were checking on all traitors. And they said, \ufb01You were in Vught, did you know a girl by the name of Hanny Janssen?\ufb02 I said yes. \ufb01Wha t did you think of her?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I think she was a spy.\ufb02 \ufb01Why do you think that?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01B ecause with -- she was called out all the time, she was never nervous, she had a tan wh en she came back. She was very talkative, so she had had wine or beer.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01I had just drawn my own conclusion.\ufb02 And I told what I had done. And then they told me it was true. But they told me that she was in Rotterdam a prostitute for the very high Ge rmans, and they had uniforms, and the top officers went to her. And England found that out, and then they asked -- and there were a lot of volunteers, and like a son of a consul, or an ambassador who grew up in Germany, was fluent in German, and went to school, they probably spoke the dialect. And they found one guy who was willing to take a very high imitated German uniform, and they dropped him off over the Netherlands in the night , out of the plane, he had to jump. And he had to worm his way into her circle of friends, and he did. And in the end he became engaged to her. But he was very broadminde d, she could see her other friends, and in bed she got so many secrets from -- and he asked questions, general, you know. And she found it out, and that went all back to Engla nd, till one day -- it was such a secret that they had to narrow it down and it pointed to her. But England had more on this guy, so he disappeared, her fianc\u00e9 disappeared. But then the Germans were with a terrible problem, was she really pro-German and a victim, what she was, or was she planted by England? So they didn\u2122t know what to do with her, so they put -- I don\u2122t know if they asked me to, so I think that she --"

But they lived far away from where my parents, qu ite a distance. And I thought, you know, that my parents -- they were so wise, because so many people in the underground were arrested, that a friend saw them and said I\u2122ve seen so and so, and that week -- and then the person was arrested. Because friends who thought it was interesting to say when they were looking for you, I\u2122ve seen them. And I rang the bell there, and I thought they say, \ufb01Hi Diet, there you are, and your parents don\u2122 t know.\ufb02 Because I had disappeared, they never got those notes any more. And they s - \ufb01Hi, I am here.\ufb02 And nothing exciting. And I said, \ufb01How are father and mother?\ufb02 They said fine. And then I said, \ufb01 come out of Vught.\ufb02 My parents had given the story that I was -- I had my wedding license, and my -- and I didn\u2122t know how to boil a potato, and Hein had 10 kids there in that family. My parents had all the time said when there is -- where is Diet, where is Diet, she -- \ufb01Oh, she doesn\u2122t know anything about the household and she\u2122s learning it at Hein\u2122s parents that she knows the household. So they did not know it. And then I told them, and they went to my parent\u2122s house. And then I did the dangerous thing. We lived very close to a corner, but in our street were a few Nazis. And I said, \ufb01Oh, I want to see my parents.\ufb02 You know, I really thought they might have been shot , so I wanted to see them. [indecipherable], \ufb01Can you go to our parent\u2122s house, and tell them to leave the door open, and then I go on the corner, and I look. If nobody is there, and I shoot in the house.\ufb02 And that\u2122s what happened. And then Mom was so happy, because they had really thought I was dead, they hadn\u2122t heard. And when -- she was helping, I told you, the baker and the milkman came to the house always, and she was just helping the milkman, and then my father came home, but she didn\u2122t want to say Diet is home, you know, because that was dangerous. So my father walks in, and I had -- we had kind of a long house at that time, so I had -- when the doorbell rang, I had gone to the back, because then if there was danger, I would climb over the wall from the rosebushes, and in an alley disappear. So I was in the back. And then my father came to the back, and he sees me, and he turns around, and walks in a side room. And oh, he is furious at me that I cau sed him so much trouble. So I followed him, and that was the first time in my life I saw him crying. And he was so happy. So then I stayed only till it was dark, and then I le ft, and found the underground. And then I went to all the guys, to Aalt and Alie, and Ab had been arrested. No, Ab at that time hadn\u2122t yet been arrested, the other leader. And I went also to my sister and her husband. So I went to all, and then they said we need you, so many have been a -- arrested. And then a guy, this [indecipherable] troop was also helping, because so many were arrested. And that -- tho - they were more in, really, you know, muniti on things and so. And one of them, a spy had to go all the time on dangerous missions. A nd it was -- we had -- he has false papers. But it was safer if he had a woman with him, so we had false papers that I was his wife, and then he prin -- it tell you that we were daily laborers, and helping with farms. So I 95 went many times with him over the rivers, a nd through territory where you really weren\u2122t allowed, but that we say we have to work for that farmer, and showed our false papers, and so -- and then he was really in spying, so he asked. \ufb01Can you work for us while you walk from The Hague to Amster-Amsterdam ?\ufb02 I saw troop movements and everything, and where they are building fort and quarters, and so then that\u2122s that stuff that they gave me for instructions, and I did that till the end of the war."

And I never forget, I was at Yen, that was another one of our group in The Hague, and he saw me, and Yen said she brings all the Jewish people to the -- to [indecipherable] to that area. And he stuck his hands in his pockets, and he held it out, and it was full with diamond and emeralds, and he, \ufb01Please, find me a place.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01You can put that away, that doesn\u2122t do anything. I help -- the forest and whatever, if we find a place.\ufb02 And then -- but this was so far in the war, I think th ey had been somewhere else, where it wasn\u2122t safe, and he had real troubl e finding a place. And then he found something, but he asked for his sister Alie, she was beautiful, a nd younger than he was. And we found a place at this very poor farm, so poor, it was really the married daughter of the farmer where we had Herman. And she was a sloppy household, where they had a bunch of babies. And you know she was -- so that was the only place, and it was so poor, and she had to sleep in the hay. And Rosa was at that time at an address [indecipherable] safe, so Rosa was there, too, and Rosa got scabies, you know, that\u2122s really from dirt. And Alie got it too. And Rosa went to -- back to Arlington when it was safe, and there she was, you know, bath and what -- boil the clothes, and so -- but Alie couldn\u2122t take it any more because Rosa told me later, she said, \ufb01That wife of that farmer was so filthy,\ufb02 they had on the table a piece of oilcloth or something, and then she said, \ufb01that\u2122s where we had to eat, they didn\u2122t have any tablecloth,\ufb02 or whatever. So -- but she changed the dirty diaper of the baby there too, on that table, and sometimes didn\u2122t clean, so it was a filthy house. And then Alie, who came from such a wealthy family, and probably had lots of servants, she couldn\u2122t hack it any more, and she went back into her other [indecipherable] and she was arrested, and she was killed. And I think oh, that poor Alie, if she had only had held out, you know."

And they were only once [indecipherable] and you always prayed beforehand if God would protect everybody, also the enemy, where the Dutch people were [indecipherable] and I think God is almighty, and Hein was killed in the end of January \u212245, the war was over.

So I figured -- and so many didn\u2122t come back, and I was spared three times that I thought this is the end, when I were driven in the dunes, when I had my hearing, when I was arrested with all that stuff. So then, I think God still has something for me to do, and I have to find it.

But I mean, I met them, and I think well, I have a purpose, you know? And they say, go along with -- tell, tell, tell, and that\u2122s what I do. And they do that now with teachers, that they over the whole world make [indecipherable], and there was in Canton, in Ohio, there is Malone College, that\u2122s a liberal arts, Malone College, and there\u2122s a large Jewish group, and they ask me -- they started -- I think th at\u2122s now about eight years ago, in the summer when the college is closed, they have a week long that it\u2122s a whole Holocaust week. And the rabbis, and the people [indecipherable] they had then one survivor of Auschwitz, an old man, and they had a Jewish lady who was hiding, a Polish Jewish lady. They had the Polish lady who had taken Jews in, and they wanted me then to come, and I [indecipherable] the whole week, and you know, I was really surprised. The first year they told me they had 12 people, and now th ere were 45, so this was the third year, and now I hope it grows. But those teachers, that is good, they go back to their schools and talk. Because I -- one lady there, they asked -- I mean, she says, \ufb01When I was in college, my prof told me the Holocaust never happened, and it\u2122s a sob story that the Jewish people do just to get pity.\ufb02 So can you imagine that you say that to a class of students? So I feel I have to go. I have to go and then like I was those 10 years in Venezuela, that was a healing time away from everything, no talk ing about it, nothing. Because when my friends from Venezuela, we only 18 Dutch families, and I knew them all because those women married mostly, they ha -- they were engaged, and then they got this great job after the war from Shell, so they quick got ma rried and they had their first baby their, and the doctors only spoke Spanish, and they were scared stiff, because [indecipherable] they were expecting their first baby, so I was called out for every delivery, and they all became my friends, and they were like brothers and sisters. And I still have contact with them. But you know, that was such a healing ti me, and I never talked about the war. And then when the book came out later, they said, \ufb01We were 10 years with you, and you never said it.\ufb02 But I think that was the good thing that I was away from all memories there."
