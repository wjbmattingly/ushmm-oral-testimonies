They came in and they taken us and we gonna get killed. And that what it is. That was Yom Kippur, about two o'clock. Wait a minute. About two o'clock, yeah. Just when we took a rest, you know, from, from praying. And of course, people got very nervous. And they didn't know what to do. Should we stay yet in the shul or should we start going into the places to hide or...they didn't know what... what we, can we do? Because we were already in their hands. We couldn't go nowhere. The whole city was like you take a, a wire and you put it around that they can't escape. Anyway, we wait...we finish there until the last prayer. And we went home. We went \u00b0 synagogue, house of prayer and gathering (Hebrew) home by rushing home. A lot of people got hurt, because they didn't let us go. They didn't ..don't go here, and don't go there. And you weren't allowed to have lights. Was no lights. We didn't know where to go. And we went into the houses. Of course, the dinner was...no dinner, you could imagine. But we were sitting and praying and talking between the family, you know. And we were talking, how can we get all together to be in one place and to keep...keep together. But I took my mother. My father wasn't alive already. My father was dead already. Because of them. They killed him. It happened that one day..."

And you weren't allowed to be the early in the morning in the street. They had certain hours. You probably know about it. And they caught him coming back already. It must have been about 7, 7:30. Because it was after the morning prayer. And they beat him up. But they wanted to cut his beard. He had a beautiful beard like you see in the, in the picture. And he didn't let himself. So that's when they told me...I was the only one that was with them, because the rest of the people were in Vengrov. There in the thing. That was in Vengrov. So he didn't let cut him the beard.

                " What to do. Where to go, where to hide. So everybody went in a different place to hide. Of course, my father wasn't alive already. We buried him. And only my mother. So I had to watch after my mother. She was an elderly woman and she didn't...she couldn't take care on herself. And she couldn't walk too good. So I took her with me where I was hiding. In the same building where we were living. We went on the roof. On the attic...not on the roof. On the attic there, there was a place. They called it the boidem\u00ae or whatever you.... And there was a lot of boxes and clothing ...what people throw out, you know, to give away. So I, I, took her to one box and I covered her up with the certain clothes. And I went in another place like...not far from her. Not to be together...one for us to be alive. And we survived, a couple days there on the roof. We took with us the...whatever was to eat in the house. What we had from before, prepared. And we had there...while we were sitting on the attic there. Finally, they, they stopped going for the Jews to take them there...to take them in one place. So we went out...and I was remaining 1n the, in the apartment where I used to live. It was on the top of our apartment. On the attic. But my mother said that...\"I want to go to Schlomo (ph)\"...that was the oldest son. The oldest brother. He's in the picture. \"I want to go up to him.\" And it was very far to go to him. It was to the...about 10 blocks to go over or maybe more. Just approximately. But she went. She went and they killed her there on the place. They caught her there, in the alley. It was alleys to go into the buildings. So they caught her and they killed her there. We didn't know the funeral. We didn't know nothing. We didn't know it. We only know that they took her to the cemetery. But where in the cemetery, what, we didn't know. There's no cemetery anyway there, anymore. And that was the living after this. "

He gave ...the ceremony. Just the ceremony. And we kept on being there but they...we couldn't stay in our city too long, because they start taking out people to work. They send them in all kind of places to work. And he used to do a little business, back and forth. From Vengrov, with my... you know, to Siedlce. Being that my brothers were in this business...leather business...we started...you know, you should make a little living, you know. So he started to buy leather. Not make...not finished leather. Finished leather ...but just the leather. And transferred to Siedlce. And that's the way he sell them there. As a matter of fact, a brother of mine took him in, in that business. So when it got so bad...and his family was there. And they had a big house. So he wanted me to come there. Because they already had taken out the people. There was not too, not too much people in that city... Siedlce. There was 30, 40 miles from Vengrov. So they said it gonna be, he...they...he had heard it whenever they took out the people to kill them or to burn them or to take them to the gas chambers, they said he's never gonna come again.

And I remember that one of the Polish people...we were very, very friendly. They were very good to us. I said \"I'm going to her. Maybe she'll hide me.\" But they were afraid for themself. So while I was going with her, I knew that I'm getting lost. I'm not...I'm not in the same place, it was the place but it was not that way to go to her, maybe. It was the other way. So I turn in the other side of the way. While I'm walking, I meet a Polish woman. And I said to her, in Polish, \"Hello\"...whatever in Polish 1s...\"Dzien Dobry.\" And I ask her \"Maybe you know\"...I ask her from where she is. And she says...she mentioned the place, the name where that...where I'm looking for that woman. She didn't have a husband, her husband died. She had two daughters with her. So I asked her in Polish \"Maybe you know Pani\"...\"Pani\" means \"Mrs.\"...where Pani Biernotska (ph) lives.\" She looks at me and looks at me and she says \"Of course I know. That's my mother.\" I wasn't too happy. Because she had boys...only boys. Four boys. And they belonged to the AK.\u2019 And I was going to find out that it's her mother, I wasn't so happy about it. I figured I'm afraid already, but I went. She took me overnight. She put me in a hiding place...in a shed there. And the next day she came in and she said to me...she cried for me. I could see her tears. \"I'm sorry that I have to tell you to leave.\" I says \"What, Mrs., we, we knew each other so many years, you were a friend of ours. Why do you telling me to leave?\" She says \"Look. First of all, you know what's going on. If they find you, I'll be killed and my children will be killed.\" So I said to her \"Why should they find me by you? You're near to the field. They * know (Yiddish) * Armia Krajowa (Home Army): One of the underground military organizations in occupied Poland; it existed from the fall of 1939 until January 1945. going around more, you know, inside the farms. Inside the people.\" She says \"My daughters have boyfriends. German boyfriends. And they constantly by me. And they going around with dogs.\" And that's what they did. They were going around with dogs to find Jewish people. I went...I went away."

I went there, I came in and there was a lot of Germans 1n the store. Not in the restaurant where they serve, but in the store. You know, to order something or buy something. And I also recognized somebody. One of my sisters...I don't know if this is interested to you. One of my sister...a friend...1s there and I recognized his wife. But when I came in to her, I didn't come in straight right to her. I couldn't go in because I had to go in through that store. From the restaurant...to the restaurant store. So I couldn't because the Germans were sitting. It must have been about six o'clock. Dark...it was dark already. But when I came in, there was a corridor with a big...you know, big doors to close that place. So I went...1t was just like this. You see? The door...this is the door, and I'm here. It's closed here. And I'm standing closed behind that door. Because I'm afraid to go into the store because the Germans are there. And I recognize that man, and I knew...she knew that he gave up Jewish people for a pound of sugar. That was a neighbor of ours. A best friend of my sister's. While I was standing, standing here...I'll never forget that, that picture. While I'm standing here, the owner's wife was passing by to the room where they served the people, you know what I mean? And I...I don't know what to do. I'm shivering and I want, I want her to know that I'm here. So I said in Polish, \"Pani Pocinska (ph).\" And she recognized my voice. After so many years we weren't there. Maybe for 10, 15 years, she recognized my voice. She says, \"Norma?\" I says, \"Yes.\" She says, \"Shhh.\" So she went in and closed all the lights. The lights were supposed to be on, I think, only to eight or seven o'clock. I think until seven o'clock. To seven o'clock, I think the light was supposed to be only. She closed the light in the store and she closed the light where the people were sitting and eating, where I told you before, the, in the room. And she came back to me, she took me and she put me under the bed. She was very good to us."

            "num": 55,
            "question": "So the Germans couldn't see in.",
            "answer": "That's right. When it got dark on the streets, the...there was no lights on the street. I mean, the time 1s when it gets dark so there weren't allowed to be lights. Not only in the restaurant, but even in the house you had to cover up the lights. Anyway, she took me in and pushed me in under the bed...under her daughter's bed. She had that one daughter. And then when they went away, she took me into the kitchen, where she gave me to eat. And I said to her, \"Where's your husband?\" And she says, \"My husband's not here.\" She knew that I wanna stay. I says, \"So where is he?\" She says he's...he produced his own, let's say...how to say it? The Polish...the Polish food. Sausages, kielbasa...you know what kielbasa is? All kind of, of this Polish meat preserves. She, he did...he had a special place like where they don't cook it but they...they roast it or something, you know. They smoke it. They smoke it. They had a place where they smoking it. He had a separate place in the yard where he had a room and they smoked it. So she told me he's there with the workers. So she says, \"Why do you need him?\" I says, \"I would like to talk to Pan Pocinski (ph)\". Mr. Pocinski (ph). And she says, \"He'll be coming in late.\" I says, When is he gonna finish?\" She says, \"Oh, about twelve, one o'clock.\" And I wanted to know from her. I figured if she'll tell me that anybody's living yet in Vengrov, maybe they were hidden somewhere and now it's quiet, they came back. So I wanted to know if he know about it...something. If he knows about it, maybe I'll go to Vengrov. Back. Coming from...jumping from Treblinka. Anyway, I waited and I asked her, \"Maybe you know something. I heard that a brother of mine, my brother, Fishel (ph)... he's in the picture...is alive.\" \"Maybe you know where he is.\" \"Oh, no, we don't know.\" She right away told me this. \"We don't know; we never saw him.\" I said, \"Maybe Pan Pocinski (ph) know.\" Mr. Pocinski (ph). She says, \"I doubt\" ...1n Polish...\"I doubt that he knows.\" She did...she...I don't know. I think she was afraid of him, that maybe he wouldn't want me to know. You know what I mean? So anyway, that remained. I was there between seven and eight 'til about one o'clock at night. By one o'clock he came in. Meanwhile, I ate and I kept on saying if nobody's alive for me...1f Mendel (ph) and Moishe (ph) and Schlomo (ph)... everybody went to Treblinka, they're not alive...what do I have to live? I have no money, I have no clothes on me. What do I have to live? Winter, cold, barefooted. I'm going to Vengrov. \"Oh,\" she says, \"they're going to kill you on the way.\" That's what she told me. \"They going to kill you on the way, because they\"...they was...I read about place that they kept on hiding and looking for Jews there. And on the way, you know, it was like woods. She says, \"You wouldn't go there. They gonna kill you right away.\" And I kept on saying to her, \"So what am I supposed to do?\" Make her notice that maybe she'll keep me. And meanwhile he came in, one o'clock in the morning he came in. And the same thing, drink with him and this and that. So I says, \"Look, I'm not in the mood. I ate. Your wife gave me to eat.\" And she put me in all kind of things in the pockets in the coat. But I had food to eat. She thought maybe I will go. And he stopped me again. I said, \"Do you know where Fishel (ph) is?\" Fil (ph). He says, \"No, I don't know Fil (ph). I didn't see him since the war started.\" But I heard a lot of rumors that he was...he was, in between the time that you could do some business, he was afraid for the Polish money. That they gonna discontinue the Polish money, so he wanted the change for American dollars. So my brother used to change him. Come and take the money, change them in the city for gold. Gold, gold pieces. American money. American gold. So I had the idea that he does this with him and he knew, but he didn't want to admit to me. And I was afraid to tell him that. You saw him and he...you probably know about him, maybe you heard about him. Everything went like, not noticing for sure, you know what I mean? Finally, he gave in. But that, that picture, you should have seen it. Finally, he gave in. He says to me this way...he holds my hand and he says to me, \"You really want to see him.\" You know, in Polish it has a little more meaning, more...more picture, you know what I mean? \"You really want to see him.\" And I said to him in Polish...1 answered him, \"Pan Pocinski (ph), do you think that that's the only one left, and I don't want to see him?\" He let my hand go. And he said, he said something to her which I don't remember even...it's like a wink, with the eyes. And he took me by the hand and he takes me in that room where it was the dining room. Where the people used to eat. And on the way going to him, I had to go through that place, the corridor where I was hidden behind the door. The door from the first coming in. And he said to me on the way, \"Don't tell me that you want to be with him.\" So and...that tell me that maybe he has a small place somewhere he is hiding him and he can't make the place bigger for somebody else, or something. But I knew in me that he wouldn't let me go. He took me in and my brother was laying on the floor. A little pillow and a little stool with a little blanket to cover himself up. He was sleeping. He said...he woke him up. He woke him up and he noticed that he's worse. So I remember distinctly what he said to him. \"What's the matter, they by you?\" In Polish. That means that the Germans came into him in the middle of the night. You know what I mean? He was doing things where he wasn't allowed to do and my brother knew it. He was killing too much pigs. He was, he had rationing...he had tickets, so much he's allowed to kill. But he was doing more. And my brother knew about it and everybody knew that he's killing too much in the place. Anyway, so he woke him up and my brother said to him he probably knew that maybe it was before I came also the same story...somebody...he came in and woke him up and he threw him. He made in the corner of the room...he took out four boards and he made a tunnel. He was outside constantly. Like during the daytime, and he slept outside. You know, in the room. But God forbid if they came in, if he knew that they here and maybe they'll come in, he shoveled him 1n, in that tunnel. You know, he made that tunnel there and he covered our back with the boards, he didn't make the boards separate, he made like a door from the boards. And on the, on the door was a machine, a Singer's machine, a sewing machine to demonstrate that nothing is there, you know what I mean? So he pushed him in there. So that's why he asked him, \"What's the matter, they here?\" My brother asked him, \"What's the matter, they here?\" He says, \"No, your sister is here.\" He was, you know, sleepy and he didn't know...he couldn't believe, because the train who went to Treblinka with those people from Siedlce the second time wasn't too far. They went in...they went through our, our farm. So he knew that it was another train going into Treblinka. So he was very scared. He didn't know what happened. A sister surviving yet, from that train? Well, anyway, I was there the rest of the couple of hours was still dark, the nighttime. And then he came in about nine o'clock in the morning and he said to me, \"So what do you intend to do, Norma? Your brother is gonna stay here. I would not throw him out. What's gonna be with you?\" And I'm speechless. What can I tell him? I says, \"Look, Pan Pocinski (ph), whatever you decide is good with me.\" That means whatever he wants to do with me, let him do. I'm in his hands now. I can't go to Vengrov and I can't stay here, so what am I gonna do? He wants to kill me, let him kill me. He says, \"Look, I'll take in more shovels, we make the tunnel bigger and you stay with your brother as long as I'm alive.\" And that was that. But being...I told you in the beginning, my brother was a sick man. He got sick because he was...right in the beginning he was in the woods and he got sick on the kidneys. So he says, \"You gonna stay together with him as long as I live and as long as I can do something for you.\" Because he was very friendly with our family and that's it. So they went...we stay in there for about four months together with my brother. If anything happens, we went into that bunker. Took off the machine and then we went in and put back the machine on."

She said to my brother, \"I know that it's the meaning, you have to eat matzo. You're not allowed to eat bread.\" You know what I mean. So she, they had a oven, so she had...she made the oven and she gave him flour. And I made the dough and we baked matzos. We baked a couple, a couple pound, about five pound flour. The meaning from the matzo, for Passover. And then my brother got worse and worse. And I don't know if I should tell you that she wanted...they wanted to save us. They wanted so much to save us. When he got very, very sick already, she went away to Sokolow...that's nearer than SiedIce...to a city which she had a doctor. Very, you know ...probably everybody who has a doctor is very close to the doctor. And she said a lie to him, to the doctor, that my brother...\"My father is such a sick man that I can't even bring him to you.\" But I...she took a bottle of his phena (ph) medication, prescription, and she said, \"I want that prescription again. They don't want to give me no medications from that prescription because it's already overdue.\" The time, you know, when the prescription ...like six months later, or whatever later. And the doctor was supposed...that's what she told us. The doctor said, \"You don't have a, a father. Your father's not sick. You having a Jew there.\" And while he said there that you have a Jew, she escaped from him. And she came back home and she told us this. She told me, not him. And a couple weeks later, he died. And I buried him. I don't know if he's still there, but I buried him with my bare hands. He made the cave. He made the cave, and I buried him, my brother, there. That was a orchard behind the, the building. Behind the house was a orchard. So I don't know this, but she told me this story that they asked him, \"In case something happens, where do you want to be buried?\" So he told them, \"Bury me under that and that tree, a pear tree.\" So that was the pear tree where he was buried.
