            "question": "Now, the next summer, did they liquidate the ghetto or did they take people away?",
            "answer": "They make two pogroms. The first pogrom they make it was approximately in August they make the first pogrom, they take us, me and my father and they took maybe 40 people, maybe 50, I don\u2122t remember how much and they called us one night. They took us in evening and put us in warehouse in Lactop. We didn\u2122t know what . We were thinking that they would kill us. We stay all the night in the warehouse. In th e morning they open up us and take us (they open us maybe 12:00 daytime) to the ghetto. When we came to the ghetto we see nobody\u2122s in the ghetto, no people. They kill all of the people and th ey put them in trucks and they take them out from the city. When I and father came to the house where we were living, it was a big building, we came in the apartment in the room. Nobody begin to cry. I can\u2122t express to you the situation. I will never forget, I came in the basement. You don\u2122t know what it is. If you don\u2122t talk about it. If you don\u2122t talk, a person deal s with life what comes on every day and if you begin to remind the time, it is ever forgotten, never. There are moments for any person, it\u2122s a hard time. You can when___________. I came home w ith father, father would begin to cry and I would begin to cry and call mother, mother and nobody answered. Now we understand what they brought us and they told us to take all the stuff what\u2122s in the apartments and in the houses and we begin to do this. A lot of people we saw what was killed in the apartments and outside. And they tell us to take the people they shot, the bodies, we take them in the wagons and somebody takes them to this place where they kill. It was outside. They stay -- the Germans and the police, they say what are we doing, faster, faster, faster. Everything, but we take everything. Don\u2122t leave nothing. Bo xes, in the wagons, put them. We do that job and it\u2122s left 50 or 60 persons, I don\u2122t know exactly how many persons, they tell us, now you can live in these buildings. We do not touch you. It\u2122s left old people. They killed some in the family\u2122s children or they killed the parents, the children left or the husband they killed, the wife left. It was not any family that came but was all the family in life. We began to stay in this place again and we were working the same in the German farm. They take us to the farm, they take us to clean up where the horses stay. Clean the toilets. In one time it not was a lot of people but they left from Germany, they left from Poland, they came to Russia and now was a lot of left, a couple people left in this city where it was the ghetto. One night came a guy and tell me \ufb01 you know what, when the Germans came he was a good jeweler and he take in the evening the German take all the stuff and maybe something can happen today or tomorrow, after tomorrow. It was why he came to take this. (END OF SIDE A, TAPE 1) We stay maybe after that\u2122s enough from the fi rst pogrom where they said you will leave and you need to work. We were working and it\u2122s best maybe at three weeks, maybe 20 days, I don\u2122t know exactly know -- a short time. People come was people come back from the forest because in the forest it was very hard because the Ukraine was killing in the places. They come back in the ghetto and come again a couple hundred people. One day, I with the father, we work in the farm and we didn\u2122t go to sleep in the ghetto afte r that what the guy say what the German take from him all the gold stuff what he need to wo rk around that. We was sleeping in the farm. One night we stayed with the father in the farm and we hear in morning, it is quiet, everything is -- nothing happen in the farm. It was straw, hay, we sleep in this place. I get up and I see the father get up and we come. It was in the barn a loft high in the top and we begin to come out. We seen nobody -- is quiet. We come only to see down somebody. The Germans with the police, they come very quiet. They were knowing what somebody\u2122s inside. When they see us,_____________ that\u2122s in German. We, with the father, we come down from the ladder, come down and see a German one or two, I don\u2122t remember. They begin to beat us. They beat me, beat the father. The father begin to talk to them in German, they didn\u2122t want to talk at all. I see he beat the father and beat me and a couple of minutes it begin to keep a lot of people but they didn\u2122t go. They left but they didn\u2122t go to the ghett o too. Then they take us again brought to the ghetto. We come to the ghetto we see this \u0152p - stay trucks and police, a lot of police and Germans. Germans was in forms was what kind of soldier I don\u2122t know, was in black forms. A color like that, that was the SS. The SS and gree n colors uniforms. We see what they stay around the ghetto, they took us in the ghetto and we stay in the house. How many people they can put in one room or two rooms in the buildings, they put us. Then maybe by one o\u2122clock or two o\u2122clock daytime, comes the first truck to th e door where they can take people. They make like a corridor, they stay the Ge rmans, the police with like ---."
