Since I was never that deeply steeped in religion, certainly I \u2014 I don\u2019t feel that they should be doing anything different.

Are you angry that others \u2014 that you had to experience things that others didn\u2019t have to, by living in a different country?",
            "answer": "No. I am basically \u2014 I\u2019m basically very tolerant. I don\u2019t judge other people, and the fact that I had to live through the war, and others didn\u2019t, I\u2019m happy that some people didn\u2019t have to experience it. Of course, I\u2019m angry that \u2014 that the people who were there, and \u2014 and suffered, that \u2014 that, of course, is a very deep anger, but you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Irene Silver March 1, 2010 can\u2019t be angry forever, you can\u2019t think about it forever, or your life will become miserable. And am I more comfortable? Not necessarily. I have very close friends who have never gone through an \u2014 through it. But I do feel more comfortable, and be f \u2014 and \u2014 and are close to those friends of mine who \u2014 who understand, as much as they can, what happened. I don\u2019t think I would be very comfortable with people who say, well, you know, what happened, happened, and let\u2019s just forget about it. I would not want to hear that. There\u2019s one other thing that sometimes comes up, and it really, I think is unfair and bothers me; 1s when people say, well, why didn\u2019t the Jews rise up? Why did they just go there like sheep? Well, times were very different. Civilians did not have any arms. They couldn\u2019t defend themselves against an army. How could a civilian without any arms, stand up to an army, with \u2014 with guns and ammunition, and \u2014 and tanks, and everything else. And in the end, there were those who were still surviving in the ghetto, who did fight, and they fought to the end. But that was at the very, very end, and they felt they would try to do anything they could. But the general population, they had no way to defend themselves. In the beginning, nobody knew about the concentration camps, at least I don\u2019t know if they \u2014 that\u2019s what I hear, that they didn\u2019t know. I certainly was too young to know anything like that. But I don\u2019t know if my family knew about the camps. I think that eventually it became clear that people who went never came Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Irene Silver March 1, 2010 back, and they \u2014 that there were these camps. But I just don\u2019t want to hear people saying, why did they not fight back? I\u2019d like to see how they would feel if they were in that situation. Now of course, anybody can get a gun, and anybody, just about, can defend themselves. But I don\u2019t know what would happen if that ever happened again, I hope it never does, but y-you should never judge people if you have not been in that situation."

            "question": "Are you a different person because of what you experienced?",
            "answer": "Yes. When I was still with my parents, even in the ghetto, I was not only \u2014 I was an only child. I was \u2014 trying to think of the right word, I was doted upon. My mother would feed me \u2014 first the nan \u2014 my nanny and then my mother would feed me til I was probably about seven or eight years old, because I didn\u2019t like to eat. And so there was always somebody taking care of me, I was really well taken care of. And because I was with my family, and with \u2014 with my parents, I didn\u2019t feel that I had to behave in any certain way. I don\u2019t know how I did behave, but I\u2019m sure I could do whatever I really wanted, if 1t was safe. But when I left the ghetto, and I was with strangers, I learned to be not only obedient, but not to annoy other people. And so I think that I became more tolerant of others. I think that I was spoiled when I was very young, but I didn\u2019t gr \u2014 but after that I didn\u2019t grow up very spoiled, I \u2014 I always had to \u2014 when a child grows up like my children, for instance, if you are not Interview with Irene Silver March 1, 2010 happy about something, you let your parents know. Well, when they\u2019re not your parents, you\u2019re not going to let them know. And even \u2014 even with my aunt and uncle, who were certainly my closest family, but still, they were not my parents. And so, I was very careful most of my life, as to how I behaved. Now, other than that, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I would have grown up to be a social worker. Probably not, if the war hadn't happened. I don\u2019t know what \u2014 what would have happened, what kind of person I would have been, if the \u2014 the war hadn't happened. I would hope that my war experiences have helped to make me into a person who cares about others."

And sometimes I think that those \u2014 that when you have a lot of trauma in your life, that makes you stronger, but sometimes I think, might work the other way. And I haven\u2019t really come to any conclusion on that, for myself. I think I am \u2014 I think with age you become stronger. I \u2014 I \u2014 I think most people will say that they\u2019re stronger than they were when they were younger. I know I \u2014 I\u2014 I was much \u2014 not that I\u2019m a noisy person, but I was more of a quiet, do what others want you to do person.

When I was in my 20s, my uncle said to me once \u2014 asked me if I wanted to apply for it, and m \u2014 I said, I don\u2019t want any money from Germany, they cannot repay me. And I didn\u2019t for the longest, longest time, apply for anything. And then eventually, I did, and it \u2014 I did because I \u2014 it changed my view upon it.
