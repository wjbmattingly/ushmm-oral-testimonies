Since I was never that deeply steeped in religion, certainly I \u0152 I don\u2122t feel that they should be doing anything different.

            "question": "Okay. Okay. Are you more comfortable with people who lived through the war, than let\u2122s say Americans here, who never had to experience what you experienced? Are you angry that others \u0152 that you had to experience things that others didn\u2122t have to, by living in a different country?",
            "answer": "No. I am basically \u0152 I\u2122m basically very tolerant. I don\u2122t judge other people, and the fact that I had to live through the war, and others didn\u2122t, I\u2122m happy that some people didn\u2122t have to experience it. Of course, I\u2122m angry that \u0152 that the people who were there, and \u0152 and suffered, that \u0152 that, of course, is a very deep anger, but you Interview with Irene Silver March 1, 2010 5 can\u2122t be angry forever, you can\u2122t think about it forever, or your life will become miserable. And am I more comfortable? Not necessarily. I have very close friends who have never gone through an \u0152 through it. But I do feel more comfortable, and be f \u0152 and \u0152 and are close to those friends of mine who \u0152 who understand, as much as they can, what happened. I don\u2122t think I would be very comfortable with people who say, well, you know, what happened, happened, and let\u2122s just forget about it. I would not want to hear that. There\u2122s one other thing that sometimes comes up, and it really, I think is unfair and bothers me; is when people say, well, why didn\u2122t the Jews rise up? Why did they just go there like sheep? Well, times were very different. Civilians did not have any arms. They couldn\u2122t d efend themselves against an army. How could a civilian without any arms, stand up to an army, with \u0152 with guns and ammunition, and \u0152 and tanks, and everything else. And in the end, there were those who were still surviving in the ghetto, who did fight, and they fought to the end. But that was at the very, very end, and they felt they would try to do anything they could. But the general population, they had no way to defend themselves. In the beginning, nobody knew about the concentration camps, at least I don\u2122t know if they \u0152 that\u2122s what I hear, that they didn\u2122t know. I certainly was too young to know anything like that. But I don\u2122t know if my family knew about the camps. I think that eventually it became clear that people who went never came Interview with Irene Silver March 1, 2010 6 back, and they \u0152 that there were these camps. But I just don\u2122t want to hear people saying, why did they not fight back? I\u2122d like to see how they would feel if they were in that situation. Now of course, anybody can get a gun, and anybody, just about, can defend themselves. But I don\u2122t know what would happen if that ever happened again, I hope it never does, but y-you should never judge people if you have not been in that situation."

            "question": "Are you a different person because of what you experienced?",
            "answer": "Yes. When I was still with my parents, even in the ghetto, I was not only \u0152 I was an only child. I was \u0152 trying to think of the right word, I was doted upon. My mother would feed me \u0152 first the nan \u0152 my nanny and then my mother would feed me til I was probably about seven or eight years old, because I didn\u2122t like to eat. And so there was always somebody taking care of me, I was really well taken care of. And because I was with my family, and with \u0152 with my parents, I didn\u2122t feel that I had to behave in any certain way. I don\u2122t know how I did behave, but I\u2122m sure I could do whatever I really wanted, if it was safe. But when I left the ghetto, and I was with strangers, I learned to be not only obedient, but not to annoy other people. And so I think that I became more tolerant of others. I think that I was spoiled when I was very young, but I didn\u2122t gr \u0152 but after that I didn\u2122t grow up very spoiled, I \u0152 I always had to \u0152 when a child grows up like my children, for instance, if you are not Interview with Irene Silver March 1, 2010 7 happy about something, you let your parents know. Well, when they\u2122re not your parents, you\u2122re not going to let them know. And even \u0152 even with my aunt and uncle, who were certainly my closest family, but still, they were not my parents. And so, I was very careful most of my life, as to how I behaved. Now, other than that, I \u0152 I don\u2122t know if I would have grown up to be a social worker. Probably not, if the war hadn't happened. I don\u2122t know what \u0152 what would have happened, what kind of person I would have been, if the \u0152 the war hadn't happened. I would ho pe that my war experiences have helped to make me into a person who cares about others."

And sometimes I think that those \u0152 that when you have a lot of trauma in your life, that makes you stronger, but sometimes I think, might work the other way. And I haven\u2122t really come to any conclusion on that, for myself. I think I am \u0152 I think with age you become stronger. I \u0152 I \u0152 I think most people will say that they\u2122re stronger than they were when they were younger. I know I \u0152 I \u0152 I was much \u0152 not that I\u2122m a noisy person, but I was more of a quiet, do what others want you to do person.

They \u0152 they all \u0152 we were all more or less in the same kind of \u0152 in the same page.
