So they -- the British came around with these sort of paramedics who would check who was still alive and they thought my father wa s dead because he was in horrible shape, emaciate and what have you. And my fath er sort of unconscious let out a sigh. He wasn\u2122t conscious of what was going on but I guess deep inside he had to let other people know that he was still aliv e because they were about to pull him away with the other dead bodies. So that\u2122s how he was saved and he was put in the same --they were put in beds. Ther e were two people per bed at this point because the British didn\u2122t have enough rati ons. And all the British had was these cans of lard that they had -- given to the prisoners. It was awful. Imagine swallowing lard without any other food or anything. So you had to like just swallow it because again my father would ju st eat anything to survive. My father informed the people that he had a brother, Jussi and that they should bring him to him. So the next night they were together. They were in the same bed They slept head to foot. And Jussi couldn\u2122t sw allow the lard because he was too malnourished or he just couldn\u2122t do it phys ically but he just couldn\u2122t swallow the lard. Had he been able to swallow the lard or had there been proper medical attention at this point he still could have been saved because -- Jussi still could have been saved because the --you --- he wasn\u2122t like -- he was still conscious and he was still relatively spea king okay. And so like the next night my father woke up, the next morning and Jussi didn\u2122t move and that\u2122s when my father -- I think he had a major, a major I won\u2122t call it a nervous breakdown but he had a major sort of you know a major depression for se veral days or several weeks because this was the last member of the family, the last connection with reality that was still there for him."
