Good evening George.",

He lived most of his childhood in Nyireghaza which was the city of the region, the bigger city. Although his grandmother, that\u2019s his father\u2019s mother lived, continued to live there, in Nyathalas. They would sometimes take vacations there. And the distance between the two cities was about, I don\u2019t know, a couple of miles but to get from Nyireghaza to Nyathalas is a big trip and it took half a day on horse and buggy. And it would be a big deal when all the kids would get to go on the carriages."

And the guard yelled down at him in Hungarian because a Hungarian Nazi and he looked up, you know pleasantly surprised and he threw down, the guard threw down a piece of bread. So he figured wow, Hungarian, there\u2019s some people love me up there.

And so the Kapo who was a prisoner who turned, became one of them, especially picked out bully types, came by and he said how come you\u2019re only filling the wheelbarrow half way because you get more productive if you fill it fully so one of the prisoners explained that we can\u2019t because we can\u2019t push it up the plank that way.

He was laying on the floor and he didn\u2019t really understand what was going on. He really didn\u2019t understand what liberation meant. So they -- the British came around with these sort of paramedics who would check who was still alive and they thought my father was dead because he was in horrible shape, emaciate and what have you. And my father sort of unconscious let out a sigh. He wasn\u2019t conscious of what was going on but I guess deep inside he had to let other people know that he was still alive because they were about to pull him away with the other dead bodies. So that\u2019s how he was saved and he was put in the same --they were put in beds. There were two people per bed at this point because the British didn\u2019t have enough rations. And all the British had was these cans of lard that they had -- given to the prisoners. It was awful. Imagine swallowing lard without any other food or anything. So you had to like just swallow it because again my father would just eat anything to survive. My father informed the people that he had a brother, Jussi and that they should bring him to him. So the next night they were together. They were in the same bed They slept head to foot. And Jussi couldn\u2019t swallow the lard because he was too malnourished or he just couldn\u2019t do it physically but he just couldn\u2019t swallow the lard. Had he been able to swallow the lard or had there been proper medical attention at this point he still could have been saved because -- Jussi still could have been saved because the --you --- he wasn\u2019t like -- he was still conscious and he was still relatively speaking okay. And so like the next night my father woke up, the next morning and Jussi didn\u2019t move and that\u2019s when my father -- I think he had a major, a major I won\u2019t call 1t a nervous breakdown but he had a major sort of you know a major depression for several days or several weeks because this was the last member of the family, the last connection with reality that was still there for him."

One of the things --- that if they found a piece of clothing on the street that was lost the Swedish would like instead of keeping it for themselves they would take it and they put it on a tree or something or hang it someplace where it was visible so if these people returned, a person returned to look for it they would find it, that kind of thing. He was very impressed with that. And also just the generosity that here was a clinic for free. He wasn\u2019t a taxpayer or anything. And the general treatment by the Swedes.
