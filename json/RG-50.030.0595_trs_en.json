But the \u2014 most of the time, the people that he dealt with likewise were immigrants from adjoining countries, because Austria was a more modern place and it offered greater opportunities than smaller countries, I mean \u2014 not smaller countries, you know, but \u2014 but th \u2014 not as advanced countries.

            "answer": "No, n-not really. Only training for Bar Mitzvah, where a year ahead of time, I would sit down with someone, not a rabbi, but one of the Hassids, who would teach me the Torah portion that I was supposed to read at my Bar Mitzvah, which Interview with Herbert Friedman \" October 17, 2010 occurred in \u00b037, actually four months before Hitler came in. And it happened to be a very momentous occasion in my life. You might find it funny, my grandmother was at first a little upset that I would have my Bar Mitzvah staged at the Klikee(ph) temple. Why\u2019? Because the Klikee(ph) temple had an organ. And having an organ in a temple, that \u2014 that was not kosher enough, so she wanted me to have it somewhere else. But I liked the Klikee(ph) temple, and I was going there. So I had to tell her that although they have this organ, they never use it. And the only time they use it was on Sundays when on occasion they have a wedding. But the mere fact that the organ was there, that was enough reason for her not to particularly enjoy being there."

And he called me a Christ killer, and you know, I didn\u2019t know what that was. I said \u2014 you know, what he was talking about.

And many a day I\u2019d come home with a bloody nose because at that time, when somebody hit you, you \u2014 you struck back.

            "answer": "I was always scared to tell my father, because \u2014 because he was the enforcer, you see, so I dealt mostly with my mother. I \u2014 I had a mean \u2014 when I was \u2014 and \u2014 and Interview with Herbert Friedman \" October 17, 2010 also, many times, I \u2014 I admit, I didn\u2019t listen. I \u2014 I was \u2014 my mother would say, a reckless person. In the summer of \u201934, I asked my mother if I could go swimming. And I loved swimming, even as a child, you know. And she said no, you stay home. So I said to \u2014 okay, well, can I go downstairs, you know, be on the street? All right, be on the street, but I want you home before too long. So I sai-said fine. So, I ran downstairs with my bathing suit to go swimming, that she had told me not to do. And I \u2014 in my eagerness to cross the street, didn\u2019t look, and I was hit by a truck. And I had several fractures and lacerations and concussion and spent three months in the hospital. That was an important lesson. But being somewhat reckless, rising to whatever challenge that came along, has always been a part of me. I-I was, to some extent, not to make myself some sort of a hero, I was always aggressive. And sometimes it got me into trouble, but it never changed my mind. This was in 734. I have another event in \u201937, when \u2014 wh-which had a great impact on my life. There were three boys, and we were walking along the Danube [indecipherable] only a three or four minute walk from where we lived, so \u2014 and this was in the winter of \u00b037, late October, when, as we\u2019re walking along, we notice something bobbing up and down in the wa \u2014 in the water, and we didn\u2019t know at first what it was. And then we recognized that this was a person, you know, what is she doing in the water? So \u2014 so it dawned on us that this person 1s about to drown. So two of us ran Interview with Herbert Friedman : October 17, 2010 down the embankment and jumped into the water. I was 13 \u2014 not quite 13, and my friend was not quite 15. And the third person ran to get the police. So, if you know anything about the Danube, and I know, since you are from Hungary, you know the Danube, it\u2019s a very swift river. You\u2019re not going to swim against the current, you just can\u2019t, it just knocks you down. So \u2014 so if you go in here, you\u2019re gonna come out way, way down on the other side. So after a while we \u2014 we struggled, but we were able to get her to th-the embankment and \u2014 and ou-out of the water. And by that time, the third person had run to get the police, and when we got to \u2014 when we got her out to the side o-of the river, the police was there, and the ambulance was there. And they picked her up and th \u2014 it was a woman, and they took her away. And then the police took the two of us to the police station. And there they gave us some hot chocolate and d-dry out. And a man came and started questioning us and then he took a picture. And we paid no attention as to who he was, or what was up, what \u2014 we were there several hours, and then they said to us, oh, now you can go home. So I went home, and I ha \u2014 I hate to describe to you what took place when I got home. First of all, 1t was Friday evening, and I\u2019m supposed to go with my father to the synagogue. And I wasn\u2019t home. And, where were you? [indecipherable] So, I was so scared to tell what happened to \u2014 to my mother, so I said, do you know what? We were playing by the water, and I fell in. Then came, how many times Interview with Herbert Friedman \" October 17, 2010 have I told you to stay away from the water? When are you finally going to listen, and so forth. And \u2014 and wa-was plenty of scolding and reprimand, you know, n-no food, you know, we\u2019re not going to give you anything. And of course I \u2014 I was so disheveled, you know, and tha \u2014 look \u2014 looked terrible. A-And it wasn\u2019t until the next day, when people stopped my mother on the street and started congratulating her, and she didn\u2019t know what for. And then she found out that there had been a picture in the newspaper, which described what had taken place. And then she came back and started questioning, what \u2014 what really happened, you see, so sh-she was of two \u2014 two \u2014 two different feelings. In the one, she says, do you realize how dangerous it was for you, what you did? A-And, this was very reckless. And the other way she \u2014 she was proud that I had participated in \u2014 1n saving a person. But th-the recklessness was a major factor, that you would go to such an extreme, which was very, very unusual. And by the way, I have a picture here, as it appeared in a newspaper, blew up and I\u2019ll \u2014 Pll show it to you later; and also comments that were about me specifically. It just so happened that this particular event became a bone of contention between the Austrian more or less public press, which for the most part was anti-Semitic, and the Jewish press, an-and the Jewish publications, who took the German newspapers to task. It \u2014 1t just so happened that the two boys who jumped into the water were Jewish. The boy who ran to get the police was Gentile. Interview with Herbert Friedman : October 17, 2010 It never occurred to us that this would ever be a problem, but it was a big bone of contention, a big discussion. The \u2014 I mean, in particular th-the Jewish press, because the Jewi \u2014 the Jews were always characterized as being cowards. Jews \u2014 Jews didn\u2019t want to be in the military, and Jews were afraid and \u2014 and unreliable, and \u2014 and they\u2019re not really Austrian and so forth, and \u2014 but here was an example where two Jewish boys jumped in the water. We didn\u2019t hesitate, we didn\u2019t ask who it was, we didn\u2019t ask what religion she was. We just acted because we \u2014 we felt we \u2014 we should do something, you see? And I have various correspondence which refers to that particular event, in \u2014 in several organizations who got involved. This was in October or \u2014 late October of 1937. One month later I had my Bar Mitzvah, and at the Bar Mitzvah there was a lot of congratulation, because this was only a month later, and the Kultusgemeinde \u2014 the Kultusgemeinde, it\u2019s called a cultural association, but really it\u2019s not a cultural association, 1-1t was a sort of a semi- government authority for the Jewish people. And every Jew in Austria had to deal with the Kultusgemeinde at least three times in their lives. The Kultusgemeinde issued the birth certificate, the marriage certificate and the death certificate. So \u2014 so every Jew had to register with the Kultusgemeinde, which later on also turned out to be a detriment for the Jewish people, because when the Nazis came in and wanted a list, all they had to do is go to the Kultusgemeinde and have a list of any Interview with Herbert Friedman me October 17, 2010 \u2014 of a Jew living anywhere in the city. So at that time the Kultusgemeinde representative came to the temple, and th-they gave me a di-diploma of recognition for what I had done, and \u2014 and also a watch.

But I\u2019m curious exactly how the Jewish press was making use of this. What were they saying, and what was \u2014 what was the conversation between the two presses?",
            "answer": "Mostly it \u2014 it dealt \u2014 they were attacking the press for their attitude toward Jews, the reason for their hostility to Jews, and their idiocy as pertaining anti-Semitism. And their failure to recognize what we had done. The majority of press had nothing, no comment whatsoever. There was only one particular newspaper, it\u2019s called \u201cDas Kleine Blatt,\u201d which carried a small picture of the two of us, and \u2014 and our age, and our name, and one paragra \u2014 one sentence, actually; and that was it. An-And no other publication \u2014 public \u2014 publication, who certainly at that time in the country, if it had been anybody else, it would have been played up big, you see?

Forty \u2014 40 years later, my son, who Interview with Herbert Friedman \" October 17, 2010 was working in Congress, and I had just given an interview in Norfolk, Virginia, where I was living at the time, and they wrote up the experience that I had, and my \u2014my background and so forth. And when he read it, h-he showed it to the congressman. And congressman was Whitehurst from Norfolk. He says well \u2014 well, we\u2019ve got to do something, this is not right. So he wrote a letter to the ambassador, giving him a \u2014 a copy of the article in the newspaper, and that I had never received any recognition. So the ambassador at that time was Thomas Klestil. Thomas Klestil went on from the embassy, the ambassador being there in Washington, to become the foreign minister of Austria. And then, from the foreign ministry, became the president of Austria. So the ambassador said that he had never heard of this, but he was going to investigate."

And working \u2014 I\u2019m a pharmacist and we \u2014 we \u2014 we had our own business in Norfolk, Virginia, and in the 80s, I experienced two hold-ups, and had a gun to my head twice, you know, and you know, people would say, well, were you scared, and so forth.

Of course, you know, I\u2019m skipping the story back and forth, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herbert Friedman \u201c October 17, 2010 maybe. So \u2014 so the first time that I had a gun to my head, it was by two black men, and they wanted Talwin, which mimics opium, but it wasn\u2019t even a narcotic, and I was astonished when they asked for it, you see. But then he asked for my wallet, so I gave him my wallet. Then he said to me, kneel down. And I said to him, if you\u2019re going to shoot me, you\u2019re going to have to look at me, I\u2019m not kneeling. And he says \u2014 and he says, all right. And he turned around and walked \u2014 and ran out. By the way, he got shot and killed two days later, trying to rob another pharmacy. The second time maybe was \u2014 maybe three \u2014 three weeks later, and this time it was by two whites. And they were more knowledgeable, they were prepared. They came with an empty pillowcase, and they knew \u2014 they probably had shopped us, and they knew where I kept the narcotics. So \u2014 so they wanted the morphine, and the Dilaudid and the Demerol, and the codeine and opium and so forth that we had; so they got all of that. And then, you know, he\u2019s holding a pistol, while the other one is loading up on \u2014 on whatever we had in narcotics. And then he said to me, ge \u2014 let me have your wallet. So I said to him, let me \u2014I says, give me \u2014 give you my wallet? I says, do you realize what problems that is? I says, I gotta run here and there to get new identification and new driver\u2019s license. I got to stop all the credit cards, I says, it\u2019s a whole lot of trouble. And so he says, all right, keep the wallet. And people couldn\u2019t believe, you \u2014 you actually did that? I says, yes. So, I\u2014I- Interview with Herbert Friedman oS October 17, 2010 throughout life, I don\u2019t panic. I-I size up the situation a-as to what I need to do and \u2014 and act accordingly. And \u2014 and I feel that when you panic, then many times the person who is the aggressor, will also panic, and then you don\u2019t know what to expect. People would ask me, they would \u2014 found it strange that the first time that you were held up, you had two blacks, right? Yeah. And the second time it was two whites? Yeah. Don\u2019t you find it strange? I says, no, I says, my \u2014 my pharmacy was an equal opportunity pharmacy. So \u2014 so they \u2014 they would laugh, it was fun. But after that, I hired the police to come in and \u2014 an-and they were \u2014 every \u2014 every afternoon and evening I would have police in \u2014 in the pharmacy, and my sons urged me, you know, it\u2019s time to get out. You know, you \u2014 you can\u2019t keep this up. Because it was true, because you \u2014 you become apprehensive that every time the door opens, you don\u2019t know who 1s coming in. And the problem with drugs today in America is so \u2014 so pervasive, that you just don\u2019t know what to anticipate. A-And you live and work in a form of tension. So although I was only 59 at the time, I \u2014 I decided to call it quits. I sold the pharmacy and retired at 59. And I took a three month vacation, you know, traveled to Europe; your country, Hungary, I was there for about a month. Enjoyed it. A-And when I came back I was restless and didn\u2019t know what to do, so I went to work for the navy, the navy hospital in the \u2014 as a pharmacist. And I worked until the 90s a-and then I quit a-and stopped working. Interview with Herbert Friedman a October 17, 2010"

As I \u2014 so as \u2014 I really wasn\u2019t concerned until the next evening, when over the radio, suddenly I heard that the plevicide had been cancelled, and the government had abdicated, and new people were coming to \u2014 into government, and they were all Nazi officials. I says \u2014 then I recognized re \u2014 this does not sound good. Something is gonna happen. And it \u2014 and true enough, why \u2014 on Sunday, German troops marched in, and announce a gov \u2014 overthrew the government, and we \u2014 we were part of Germany. We had been annexed, or anschluss. And this \u2014 and suddenly we\u2019re oven \u2014 over-overnight we\u2019re pri \u2014 night, I was confident that Austria would never become part of Germany, suddenly e-everyone \u2014 everyone that you met wu \u2014 seemingly seemed to be connected to \u2014 with the Nazi party all along, in the underground [indecipherable]. And everybody ha-had this \u2014 the armband on with the Nazi insignia, and flags all over the city, and I couldn\u2019t understand how suddenly people that I \u2014 I felt 1f you give them the chance to vote would have voted against the Nazis, now everybody seemed to be for it. The \u2014 the cardinal of Austria, Innitzer, welcomed Hitler as, you know, the native son returning to his country and so forth, and \u2014 and 1t seemed so unbelievable, how overnight something as dramatic a-as a \u2014 as giving away everything and becoming a devoted Nazi, a-and the Jewish people going to be the target, you see, because we Interview with Herbert Friedman * October 17, 2010 heard it con-consistently, with the editor of the newspapers, or ev \u2014 ev \u2014 everything became pro-Nazis, a-and you saw no opposition whatsoever. Everybody was for the Nazis. And the people were f-for the Nazis. Either that, or afraid, because seemingly 100 percent were not necessarily in favor of what was taking place, but it seemed to be the vast majority were. And the plundering took place, and the beating took place and the dem \u2014 the humiliation took place, you know, all the graffiti that had been anti-Nazi \u2014 they take elderly Jewish people, and sometimes religious people, whoever they were, peop-people of recognition, professional people, you know, and would humiliate them, give him a toothbrush and tell him to scrub the streets and so forth, and spit at them and make fun. And the people would stand around and laugh."

            "answer": "On Kristallnacht, no \u2014 November nine, we saw what was going on on the street, that the shops are being plundered, a-and the Jewish people are \u2014 on the street were being beaten up, so you\u2019re afraid to \u2014 as to what may happen. And the greatest fear was to hear the knock on the door. When you \u2014 when you heard that knock on the door, we froze. And I could see the expression on my \u2014 my father and my mother\u2019s face, and I \u2014 and I knew they \u2014 they were scared. And it passes onto the children when you \u2014 wh-when they see that the \u2014 the parents are \u2014 are frightened. And the \u2014 there\u2019s a knock on the door and the order, open up. So, we opened up the door, and to \u2014 two uniformed SA people walked in, one a little older tha-than the other one. The other one licked \u2014 looked to be sa \u2014 someone maybe 18 or 19 years old, something like that. And they demanded to see my brother, specifically asking for ba \u2014 for him by his name, but he was not home. So they didn\u2019t believe it, so they went through the apartment, searching for him, and he wasn\u2019t there. So, since he wasn\u2019t there, one of them, the elderly one said, we\u2019ll take him, pointing to me. And it was then that my mother started pleading and crying, saying he 1s only a little boy, he hasn\u2019t done anything, and please leave him alone, you know \u2014 you know, just begging him. And \u2014 and it was then that the younger SA man said, it wasn\u2019t him. Tha-That\u2019s it, it wasn\u2019t him. And they said oh \u2014 okay, we\u2019ll come back in a Interview with Herbert Friedman * October 17, 2010 little while. So, when I heard it wasn\u2019t him, a-as I \u2014 I surmised that maybe my brother had gotten into a fight, and now was the time to get even, you see. And the mere fact that it wasn\u2019t him, saved me. And because my mother, as soon as they left, told me to run downstairs and intercept my brother from coming home, and telling him to stay with a friend, not to come home. And \u2014 and then she sent me to tell my uncle not to go home, and to stay with his mother-in-law. That was interesting too, and h-he \u2014 he told me later on, that they came to his mother-in-law\u2019s home, you know, everybody knew already where most likely somebody would \u2014 would go if you want to pick him up. And when he heard the knock on the door, he crawled under the table, and the table had a long tablecloth. So they were searching the house, the \u2014 the apartment that they lived in, and they didn\u2019t see him. And they were pounding the table, saying well, you be sure to \u2014 to let us know as soon as he comes here. Well, he was under the table. He survived. His wife and his son did not survive. But i-it was, th-the following day, on the 10\u201c of November, when I wa \u2014 was on my way to go to the Palestina(ph) office to check on the \u2014 on my aliyah, which is immigration to then known Palestine or Israel. When I came downstairs, I saw a\u2014a big truck and a lot of people around the truck jeering and laughing and enjoying themselves. And the police is there also, just standing there. And I was wondering what the heck is going on here, what\u2019s it all about, you know? And \u2014 and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herbert Friedman * October 17, 2010 the house right next door to us, there was a shop, a shop carrying bedding equipment, blankets and pillows and pillowcases and towels and stuff like that. And I noticed that they were carrying stuff out from the shop, and putting it on the truck. Well, you recognize right away, it doesn\u2019t take long, as to what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re just confiscating whatever goods he has and putting it on the truck. And then I saw the owner standing there beside the \u2014 the shop. Hi-His name was shp \u2014 H-Herr Schpringer(ph). A Mr. Schpringer(ph). A-And he\u2019s white-faced, scared. And when they had just about emptied the shop, Mr. \u2014 Herr Schpringer(ph), being a business man, walks up to the head honcho Nazi there, and asks for a receipt. And th-the storm trooper turned around and yelled to the crowd, Herr Schpringer(ph) wants a receipt. And everybody starts laughing and cheering and screaming. And then he grabs Schpringer(ph) by the neck, the collar of his neck, and turned him around and gave him a kick in the rear, and Schpringer(ph) fell down on the pavement. And he said, here Jew, this is your receipt. I \u2014 I witnessed that. A-And I-I felt that even going to the aliyah office may not be such a good idea. I says \u2014 so I decided to go to the home of the chief rabbi."

For instance, if I told you I saw Eichmann, and asked him to put a country on my passport, it\u2019s only years later that I even became aware who he was. I had no idea Eichmann, I never heard of him. But I went to \u2014 to the Rothschild palace, which was the Nazi headquarters, and I walked in there \u2014 well, when you walk in there, everything is heil Hitler, you know, an-and I\u2019m not going to come in and say heil Hitler, so wha-what am I going to say? Griiss gott. Which was the way we normally greeted each other, griiss gott, and \u2014 greet God. And \u2014 and everybody looks up, you know, what\u2019s this Jewish kid doing here?

            "answer": "Oh, orig \u2014 originally had planned to go, th-then I said to myself, no, no, this may be too dangerous. So \u2014 so I went to \u2014 actually, it wasn\u2019t that night either, on recollection. I\u2014 I went \u2014 I did go to the aliyah office. I\u2019m sorry, I had to correct myself. I went to the aliyah office, a-and when I came there, it was packed with people; men and women. And I wasn\u2019t there very long when the SS showed up, and they sent men to one side, and the women and children to the other side. And I had had my Bar Mitzvah, so it came up to me to decide which side should I go on? And I felt that maybe I better play it safe. So I decided to go with the women, although you know, people who had had their Bar Mitzvah, they regard themselves already as men. But, you know, I \u2014 I says, I \u2014 I better play it safe. And it wasn\u2019t very long thereafter, when we had separated and we were in different rooms, that all the men were taken away by truck. And later on I learned that they had been taken to Interview with Herbert Friedman 7 October 17, 2010 Dachau. Had I stayed with the men, I would have wound up in Dachau, but I was with the women. So they kept us there for an hour, an hour and a half, til they decided what to do with us, what \u2014 they let us go. And here again comes the recklessness. They let us go, and I\u2019m going out on the s \u2014 from the building. So I thought that more and more men will be coming to the building, and they\u2019re gonna get arrested, and maybe I ought to warn them. But in back of me, there\u2019s an SS man, right in the building. If you\u2019ve been to Vienna, I am \u2014 the building 1s still there, and it\u2019s not far \u2014 the Hotel Metropol was Gestapo headquarters. It\u2019s only one block away. And maybe two blocks away is the Kultusgemeinde on the Juden \u2014 on the Judengasse. So this was in the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the Aurelia street, you see, which on \u2014 only short walk where the aliyah office was. Years later I took my wife there and I showed her where it was. A-And so I stood at the edge of the \u2014 the pavement \u2014 pedes \u2014 pedestrian pavement, not the street, and as men were approaching me to go into the building, I would turn my head away and say, don\u2019t go in, Gestapo. And invariably, they would say, what did you say? And I would repeat, you know, but not looking directly at him, as if I \u2014 but the Gestapo in back of me was a trooper, noticed that people were coming up to me and turned around and walking away. So a-after three or four had done this, he comes out and yells for me to come back. And he wants to know, what did you say to the men? Was hast Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herbert Friedman . October 17, 2010 du gesagt? I says, I didn\u2019t say anything, I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014I-\u2014I said I\u2014 oh, you said something. I said, the only thing I said was I was here for some time and I just got out. That I waited a long time, but I just got out. That\u2019s not what you said, tell me what you said. So I stuck by my story. So yeah, they \u2014 he wanted \u2014 he really beat me, and then he kicked me down the steps. There were about three steps as \u2014 as you entered the building. So I fell over the three steps, and I got up, and I ran away."

            "answer": "Yeah, a-and help me. Well, I-I\u2019m 14 years old, I have no money. Absolutely not \u2014 not one penny, nothing. And I don\u2019t speak the language. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m at this place in Dovercourt in Lowestoft(ph), freezing cold. I mean, this cabin, no running water.

I couldn\u2019t stay warm.

And I said, you know, to \u2014 to my friend who is staying with me, I says, you know, I can\u2019t take this any more, I says, I\u2019m not gonna stay here. So \u2014 so I just took the blanket, and I went into the dining hall, and there they had a fireplace, and I put the blanket on the floor. And for the rest of the time that I was at this camp, I slept on the floor in front of the dining place, ju-just ha-had to stay warm. But this is a different story now. As far as my uncle is concerned, he writes to me from time to time that he \u2014 he also has no money, and he\u2019s hungry. And then in one letter he\u2019s saying that \u2014 now that you\u2019re safe and out of the country, it\u2019s your responsibility to help me, to help me get out of the country.

My father is in United States, a good looking man, and maybe it went on in her head Interview with Herbert Friedman \u201d October 17, 2010 that maybe he\u2019s met somebody, which later on I hear, was not that unusual. So sh \u2014 the pressure went on, with me caught in the middle. She\u2019s writing to me that he\u2019s not doing anything to help her get out of the country. In the meantime, he\u2019s in this country, he doesn\u2019t speak English. He doesn\u2019t know who is what, or where to go or what do you do. He doesn\u2019t have any money either. He\u2019s dependent upon the assistance from \u2014 from the distant cousins who have no relation whatso-whatsoever. I don\u2019t know what their finances were at the time. So, you know, one letter I get, that I should write to my father, that if he doesn\u2019t do something to help my mother to get out of the country, that I should write to him \u2014 oh, she said, send a cable \u2014 h- how am I gonna send a cable \u2014 tha-that I would have nothing to do with him, if he wasn\u2019t more active in helping. I realized the situation she\u2019s in, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. So I wrote him what she told me. And then I get a letter from my father, that this is no way to talk to me. A-And you know, I \u2014 I\u2019m in the middle of this thing, in the \u2014 in the back and forth, and you know, th \u2014 1-it was for me a very, very uncomfortable and stressful and it\u2019s \u2014 1f you can put yourself in the situation where \u2014 where you are put in the situation of choosing between your father or your mother, I mean how \u2014 how do you do this? A-A-And \u2014 and \u2014 and who 1s right and who is wrong, an-and what\u2019s going on? I don\u2019t know. Bu-But you ask me to do this, all right, \u20191l \u2014 Pll do it. You see, so \u2014 but I mean, th-that has always bothered me Interview with Herbert Friedman * October 17, 2010 that \u2014 that I wrote that letter. And I \u2014 he s \u2014 my father berated me, that this no way to talk to me, and it was disrespectful. But 1-it was \u2014 you know, the war broke out and my mother is still over there, and finally she did get an affidavit, cause America and Germany, there was still correspondence going on because America was not at war in \u201939.

It is reported that he acted shamefully, that he molested women, and if they didn\u2019t cooperate, he\u2019d put them on the list to be deported. There are books written about his deed.

And the wife wanted to have him buried in the Jewish cemetery, and they refused.

I understand that there is some sort of a custom that if you are an apostate, or you\u2019ve done something disrespectful to the Jewish people, they let you be buried in the Jewish cemetery, but away from everybody, only at the edge. So that is where he\u2019s buried, in Italy. That\u2019s the story of the rabbi, Benjamin mermu \u2014 Benjamin Murmelstein. And I have \u2014 I can\u2019t remember the name of the book, but there\u2019s a \u2014 a book written about the \u2014 the Judenrat, he was the head of the camp at Theresienstadt, and he s \u2014 replaced Edelman, who was the former head. And Edelman, before being deported, advised the committee there, don\u2019t trust Interview with Herbert Friedman *\u00b0 October 17, 2010 Murmelstein. And if you like, Pll give you name of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the book, and \u2014 and you can Google M-Murmelstein."

I don\u2019t know if \u2014 you didn\u2019t write down the name. Benjamin Murmelstein. | still have the Bar Mitzvah book that I received. That\u2019s another story. It was about two or three days before we left. We had to take our suitcases and to have it inspected by the Gestapo. And you were not allowed to take any money, you\u2019re not allowed to take any cameras, no jewelry, nothing of any value. You \u2014 a-anything in your possession had to be in your possession as of \u201937, as I mentioned earlier. No \u2014 no typewriters, nothing \u2014 no musical instruments, an-and the only thing that was not listed was books. And since it wasn\u2019t listed, I felt, you know, I always liked books, and the nicest present you could give me for my Bar Mitzvah would be a book. So, I\u2014 I had received quite a few books, so I put them in a suitcase. And when we went to the Kultusgemeinde, where we had taken our suitcase to, the Gestapo agent said, what\u2019s with these books? And my mother said, well, he likes to read. He doesn\u2019t need them. So he started \u2014 took some of the books and tossed them all out. You know, just threw them away, but he left some books there. And one of the books he\u2019d left was the Interview with Herbert Friedman \u201d October 17, 2010 Bar Mitzvah boy \u2014 prayer book, which I still have, with the date and everything. Another document. German Bar Mitzvah prayer book. So where are we in the story?"

            "answer": "O-Only my mother. My father was \u2014 oh, she felt my father may be arrested, you know, so he \u2014 because fo-for a while he just didn\u2019t leave the house. So it was \u2014 I-I had no idea what to expect, but when w \u2014 when we got there, each child had to be dropped off at the foot of the steps. That was in the requirement that we had received, as to what procedure to follow for the transport, and \u2014 and we were to arrive at a certain hour, and in my case late in the evening. The child had to be drop off at the steps of the foot o-of the entrance. The parent was not allowed on the platform. Only one parent could come, and we would be given a number, and that was it. A-And now we arriving at the station. And there are hundreds of parents with a child, and well, I\u2019m almost 14, only one day away. This is a \u2014 late in \u2014 at night, on the 10\" of December, and I\u2019m listening to some of the conversation that was going on, you know, with the \u2014 the conversation between my mother a-and me, we \u2014 we \u2014 we knew what to accept. I wanted to be part of 1t, my mother wanted me out of the country, so it was, write to me, we\u2019ll get together, we\u2019ll be okay an-and Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 so forth, and you know, my \u2014 each \u2014 each one encouraging the other, y-you see, so \u2014 so I\u2019m not \u2014 I \u2014 I recognize what 1s taking place, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not emotionally carried away, because I know we\u2019re gonna meet up again, you know. My father, a month later is leaving, so I know we\u2019re gonna get together some \u2014 at some time. When or what, of course, we had no idea. But I\u2019m listening to what goes on around me, which I found very heartrending. I had no idea that on this transport would be children between two and 16. And the conversation of some of these children, four, five, six years old, they had no idea what was taking place, and what \u2014 why they were there and where they were going and why they were going an-and \u2014 and are you not coming with me, or \u2014 or I don\u2019t want to go, I want to stay. You don\u2019t love me, or \u2014 I get emotional even today when I talk about it because at the time I \u2014 I was not as em-emotionally affected as I am now, because now I have children and grandchildren and I don\u2019t know if I would have the courage of the parents, the sacrifice that they made, to take a kid at that age and send him away. I-It took a lot of guts, I mean, cause I don\u2019t want you to worry, or write to me, or we\u2019ll soon get together, and it\u2019s all fabricated. They don\u2019t know. And as finally happened, close to 90 percent of the children never saw their parents again. So 1-1t \u2014 it was a very, very stressful period. A-And you know, give them a number, I \u2014 you know, my number was thr \u2014 325, so I knew I was going to England \u2014 because until then I didn\u2019t even Interview with Herbert Friedman ~ October 17, 2010 know where I was going for sure. So \u2014 so I knew I was going to England. And they took the younger children, they put them in one wagon, the older children in another wagon. And the girls in one wagon, the boys in another wagon, so \u2014 and I remember on the \u2014 f-for the \u2014 for the most part we had a certain amount of fear as to what was going to happen, even on the train, whenever it stopped and the Nazi personnel came on an-and then they walked through and \u2014 because they could kick you off the train, you know. Somebody \u2014 there was a rumor that somebody was taken off the train. If there was or wasn\u2019t, I have no idea, you know, rumor circulates. So we had some social workers from the Kultusgemeinde who came with us and they had \u2014 they were going to be allowed to leave the country, but their family was held hostage, they had to return. And we a-arrived to the [indecipherable] 1-in \u2014 late \u2014 late at night, after a day and a half of traveling on the train, we arrived in Holland and the train stopped on the German side first, and they inspected, and whatever and then they let the train proceed across the border. And once we crossed the border all hell broke loose, and everybody started yelling and screaming and cheering and you know, because now we knew we were free; no longer to be afraid of the Nazis or what they could do. And I remember people coming up to the train and th-they offered us drinks and \u2014 and sandwiches and so forth, a very friendly reception 1-in Holland. And after a little while, I-I was so tired Interview with Herbert Friedman .\" October 17, 2010 from the day and a half on th \u2014 on the train that I \u2014 I-I could \u2014 I could barely stay awake. So \u2014 so all I remember is I got on this boat and the crossing of the channel is very stormy, I \u2014 and I got motion sick. I\u2019d never been on any ocean, I \u2014 first time I \u2014 I\u2019m seeing an ocean. And in the morning the \u2014 the next morning we \u2014 we arrived in Harwich, England, and I faintly remember \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 being taken to Lowestoft(ph) in Dovercourt. And there I stayed maybe three weeks, something like that, and my \u2014 my problem started, I was there three weeks then \u2014 then they \u2014 they sent me to Ipswich, and I was there 10 days, and being \u2014 and then I went to another place, 1t was a convalescent home for sick people, and \u2014 and in each time 1- i-in the \u2014 in Dovercourt every weekend, they \u2014 they would line us up and \u2014 and people would come down a-and pick out certain children. And you know, I asked them what\u2019s going on? These are people that \u2014 private people want to take a child in their home. But I noticed that whenever they picked anybody out, they wanted a small, small, young children. Nobody wanted to get a teenager, you see, so nobody picked me. So \u2014 so I was going to this convalescent home, and then I went another place. Each time I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m staying a week or two, or three weeks, and then I go another place, and then finally I was sen \u2014 we went to a place called \u2014 they always cut down the number of boys, always \u2014 you know, th \u2014 by then, I think we\u2019re down to a dozen boys a-and \u2014 and we\u2019re going to a\u2014 San Remo hotel in Margate, near \u2014 Interview with Herbert Friedman \" October 17, 2010 near Dover. And th-that was sort of a family run hotel, small hotel, and I really liked it. I said oh, this 1s beautiful. I sa \u2014 th-the ocean, a-and \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s gotten warmer and the food is great, and we were there maybe two and a half weeks, and the proprietor tells us that you'll have to leave, you know, some other place. I says, why, I says, you know, we like it here. We said, we want \u2014 I want to stay here, I said, this is \u2014 this is very nice. He said, I\u2019m very sorry, but I can\u2019t support a group of boys and nobody pays us. So that was the first time that I realized that \u2014 what was going on. That we\u2019re being shifted from one place to the other. Maybe they said, all right, I\u2019ll take them for a few days, and so forth, you see, but nobody was paying anybody, you see, so these people were \u2014 were offering to house some \u2014 some boys until they realized that th \u2014 they\u20191l have to make room for us, and there\u2019s certain expense involved, and \u2014 and you \u2014 there\u2019s no funds available."

And a-as it came closer a- and I \u2014 and suddenly I heard a huge explosion, and the building shook and the glass broke and I had been sleeping, you know, I \u2014 I sat up quite alarmed.

So \u2014 so I went to see the dean of admission and everything 1s fine with him, except he wants me to promise that I will attend the school, if given a schol \u2014 made enough Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herbert Friedman \" October 17, 2010 of a scholarship that I will actually accept it. And the problem was that I already had received orders to go into the army. I says, I can\u2019t promise. I don\u2019t know when I will be called. So \u2014 so I never accepted the scholarship. But th-the surprise was the orders that I received after basic training, was to go to the Pacific, which I didn\u2019t want, but I had no choice."

So I looked forward to that, working in the hospital, fine. And we were on the water over a month, maybe five weeks on the water. Can you imagine? And if you read the description there, it was a freighter that had been converted into a troop ship. And we were, as I say there, packed in like sardines, thousands of troops, and one on top of the other, we stacked on \u2014 on sort of a canvas bunk a-an \u2014 and \u2014 and there\u2019s non \u2014 you can\u2019t turn around, because it\u2019s so close, and you got to climb up a for \u2014 four or five high, as to whe \u2014 where you\u2019re gonna stay, a-an \u2014 a-and if you \u2014 you take a shower, but it\u2019s salt water, and there\u2019s no way that you can lather yourself in soap water, it just doesn\u2019t work.

And th \u2014 an-and \u2014 an-an-and it\u2019s the same clothes, yo \u2014 you know, and there\u2019s no change of clothes. A-And you feel real miserable. You get \u2014 1-in the \u2014 in this article I saw it was a\u2014a preparation for jungle warfare. But we were about five weeks on the water. Today you can fly over there in one day. But when I \u2014 we landed in [indecipherable] and I was there maybe a little over a week and then was back on the ship again, and where we going? Everything was always secret, nobody knew.

One time the \u2014 they took us out and we fired a machine gun and I Interview with Herbert Friedman a October 17, 2010 fired the \u2014 a carbine and an M-1 rifle, yeah, I fired one time. But th \u2014 but how to clean it, how to handle it [indecipherable] no \u2014 no extensive training. Yeah, that one time it was a wa \u2014 how to disarm somebody who comes to \u2014 at you with a \u2014 with a bayonet on the rifle. How to disarm that person. That\u2019s a-another story. But I was assigned as a medic to the infantry, and from day one I hated it. It 1s \u2014 first of all, the living conditions were so terrible. The food was horrible. Ev-Everything was powdered, we \u2014 we got nothing fresh. You living in the jungle, a-and you know, 1- insects crawling all over you. And you know, I\u2019m a city boy, I\u2019m \u2014 you can\u2019t take a bath, y-yo-yo-you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 it takes weeks to get a letter. A-And we were not directly \u2014 at least I was not directly involved in \u2014 in combat, but we \u2014 we got the wounded, and \u2014 an-and my job was principally thr-three directions; overcome shock, hemorrhage and fractures. A-And you learn, it\u2019s amazing. Really, you know, I was astonished how much you can learn just by watching what somebody else does, and then sometimes having somebody who knows, come over and \u2014 and work with you, and so you learn those things. How to apply traction, and how to apply support, and sa \u2014 and put on a cast and all that. You know, you learn that, because later on, toward the end of the war, I was assigned to, you know, shipped to Hawaii, a-and \u2014 and there I became an instructor and the draft was still going on, and new recruits were coming in and I was lecturing in \u2014 1n two subjects \u2014 three Interview with Herbert Friedman \"\u00b0 October 17, 2010 subjects; sanitation, first aid and venereal diseases. And I always started off my lecture in venereal diseases, telling them that many times \u2014 at that time, when you got a venereal disease, you could be court-martialed and put into prison. You may not know this, and it\u2019s totally different today, but then, you know \u2014 so \u2014 so \u2014 so gonorrhea was a major problem to \u2014 to many, and disabling, and because it\u2019s so infectious. So \u2014 so I wou \u2014 I would start off my \u2014 my lecture with contrary to what you may have been told, that you cannot catch gonorrhea off a toilet seat, I want to assure you that that is incorrect. It is possible to get gonorrhea off a toilet seat, but it\u2019s a hell of a place to take your girlfriend. You see, because many times, when you asked a soldier, how did you get this? You see, oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe off a toilet seat, you know. It\u2019s really nonsense, you see it was \u2014 so but this was \u2014 got a big laugh, and \u2014 and \u2014 and I would have the attention of the audience. A-And when the war had ended, but I was still in Hawaii, and troops were being repatriated back to the country, I asked the commanding officer if he will authorize me to go to the university there, so he said okay. So I went to the \u2014 for a little while to the University of Hawaii. An-And then when I came back, I-I \u2014 you know, I thought I\u2019d become a doctor, until one day I met a guy who had graduated from high school with me, and you know, hi Herb, you know, Phil, how are you doing? We start talking to each other, where \u2014 what are you doing now? I says, well, I\u2019m going to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herbert Friedman \" October 17, 2010 college park, I\u2019ve been accepted to be pre-med. So he says, why do you want to go to pre-med? He says, you know, when you finish it, what do you got? Nothing. Then you still gotta go to med school, right? I says yeah, of course. He says, well, why don\u2019t you go to pharmacy school? I says, why should I go to pharmacy? I want to become \u2014 he says, no, he says, you use that as your pre-med. And this way you at least have a degree as a pharmacist and you \u2014 and you can work during the summer and then pay for medical school \u2014 because I had no money. So I thought it was a good idea. The \u2014 the problem was that 1t was mid-August and school starts in September. So \u2014 so, how do I get in? Because at that time so many thousands of soldiers came out, an-and they all wanted to go into \u2014 applied to Hopkins. Hopkins turned me down and said, reapply next year. Well, you\u2019re not going to sit around for a whole year. Now I\u2019m in my 20s, 21 or 22 years old. So I \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve \u2014 I thought about it, I says, you know, it\u2019s not a bad idea, but would I get in? So \u2014 so I-I went there, and I asked to meet th-the dean of admission, was a elderly woman. And she gave me the same answer, she says, we \u2014 we can admit you next year, but our classes are closed. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be possible. She says, well, 1f somebody last minute doesn\u2019t want to come in, you know, maybe. I\u2019ll give you an application, she says, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. I-I-I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s gonna be possible. So I said to her \u2014 her name was Kohl(ph). I-I-I said, Dean Kohl(ph), if you admit me, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Herbert Friedman = October 17, 2010 Pll come back and kiss you.

And \u2014 and then gradually we heard that his son, my cousin, he was 18 years old, he was killed in Auschwitz. And the most difficult thing for my mother was to learn that the husbands of her sisters and the children had survived, but the sisters had not. A-And mentally, she was finished after this. I-It was \u2014 life at home was o \u2014 was, from then on was very, very difficult. Later on when the \u2014 I \u2014 I went back into the army, by the way, during the Korean War, an-and became a commissioned officer. But \u2014 and we lived in Virginia for 40 years, but every time I went home, all I had to do was open the door an-and \u2014 and it was \u2014 she\u2019d talk about the brother and the sister, and the brother and the sister and why and this and that. An-And a certain regret. It\u2019s just difficult. She should have left me in England and should have worked on getting out the brother. I was safe. And maybe she could have helped the brother at that time. And I \u2014 I Interview with Herbert Friedman \u2122 October 17, 2010 knew she was right. So \u2014 so you carry that burden, you know, am I responsible, you know, and \u2014 you know, I just \u2014 could I have done something, you know, who \u2014 who \u2014 about my uncle, who should I have talked to? I mean, I didn\u2019t know anybody, I \u2014 you know, where, what? I mean, I don\u2019t even know where \u2014 where is he? What\u2019s the address, you know?

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me from day to \u2014 one to the next day, so \u2014 so how am I \u2014 well, but \u2014 but you have that complex of guilt, you know, that he is my friend, I didn\u2019t do anything for him. A-A-And then you hear about the other kids, a million and a half, you know, and I survived and they didn\u2019t. And why did I survive? A-And you know, for many years, while I was busy working in the off \u2014 in the \u2014 in the pharmacy, and my wife can tell you, I was okay. It was when I stopped working that all this came back to me, a-and it to \u2014 to this day, you know, I\u2019m very much troubled. And \u2014 and for a while, I had to get some help.
