And it happened to be a very momentous occasion in my life. Y ou might find it funny, my grandmother was at first a little upset that I would have my Bar Mitzvah staged at the Klikee(ph) temple. Why?

            "answer": "I was always scared to tell my father, because \u0152 because he was the enforcer, you see, so I dealt mostly with my mother. I \u0152 I had a mean \u0152 when I was \u0152 and \u0152 and Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 12also, many times, I \u0152 I admit, I didn\u2122t listen. I \u0152 I was \u0152 my mother would say, a reckless person. In the summer of \u212234, I asked my mother if I could go swimming. And I loved swimming, even as a child, y ou know. And she said no, you stay home. So I said to \u0152 okay, well, can I go downstairs, you know, be on the street? All right, be on the street, but I want you home before too long. So I sai-said fine. So, I ran downstairs with my bathing suit to go swimming, that she had told me not to do. And I \u0152 in my eagerness to cross the stre et, didn\u2122t look, and I was hit by a truck. And I had several fractures and lacerations and concussion and spent three months in the hospital. That was an important lesson. But being somewhat reckless, rising to whatever challenge that came along, has always been a part of me. I-I was, to some extent, not to make myself some sort of a hero, I was always aggressive. And sometimes it got me into trouble, but it never changed my mind. This was in \u212234. I have another event in \u212237, when \u0152 wh-which had a great impact on my life. There were three boys, and we were walking along the Danube [indecipherable] only a three or four minute walk from where we lived, so \u0152 and this was in the winter of \u212237, late October, when, as we\u2122re walking along, we notice something bobbing up and down in the wa \u0152 in the water, and we didn\u2122t know at first what it was. And then we recognized that this was a person, you know, what is she doing in the water? So \u0152 so it dawned on us that this person is about to drow n. So two of us ran Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 13down the embankment and jumped into th e water. I was 13 \u0152 not quite 13, and my friend was not quite 15. And th e third person ran to get the police. So, if you know anything about the Danube, and I know, since you are from Hungary, you know the Danube, it\u2122s a very swift river. You\u2122re not going to swim against the current, you just can\u2122t, it just knocks you down. So \u0152 so if you go in here, you\u2122re gonna come out way, way down on the other side. So after a while we \u0152 we struggled, but we were able to get her to th-the embankment and \u0152 and ou-out of the water. And by that time, the third person had run to ge t the police, and when we got to \u0152 when we got her out to the side o-of the river, the police was there, and the ambulance was there. And they picked her up and th \u0152 it was a woman, and they took her away. And then the police took the two of us to the police station. And there they gave us some hot chocolate and d-dr y out. And a man came and started questioning us and then he took a picture. And we paid no a ttention as to who he was, or what was up, what \u0152 we were there several hours, and then they said to us, oh, now you can go home. So I went home, and I ha \u0152 I hate to describe to you what took place when I got home. First of all, it was Friday evening, and I\u2122m supposed to go with my father to the synagogue. And I wasn\u2122t home. And, where were you? [indecipherable] So, I was so scared to tell what happened to \u0152 to my mother, so I said, do you know what? We were playing by the water, and I fell in. Then came, how many times Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 14have I told you to stay away from the water? When are you finally going to listen, and so forth. And \u0152 and wa-was plenty of scolding and reprimand, you know, n-no food, you know, we\u2122re not going to give you anything. And of course I \u0152 I was so disheveled, you know, and tha \u0152 look \u0152 looked terrible. A-And it wasn\u2122t until the next day, when people stopped my mother on the street and started congratulating her, and she didn\u2122t know what for. And then she found out that there had been a picture in the newspaper, which described wh at had taken place. And then she came back and started questioning, what \u0152 what really happened, you see, so sh-she was of two \u0152 two \u0152 two different feelings. In the one, she says, do you realize how dangerous it was for you, what you did? AAnd, this was very reckless. And the other way she \u0152 she was proud that I had participated in \u0152 in saving a person. But th-the recklessness was a majo r factor, that you would go to such an extreme, which was very, very unusual. And by the way, I have a picture here, as it appeared in a newspaper, blew up and I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll show it to you later; and also comments that were about me specifically. It just so happened that this particular event became a bone of contention between the Austrian more or less public press, which for the most part was anti-Semitic, and the Jewish press, an-and the Jewish publications, who took the German newspapers to task. It \u0152 it just so happened that the two boys who jumped into the water were Jewish. The boy who ran to get the police was Gentile. Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 15It never occurred to us that this would ev er be a problem, but it was a big bone of contention, a big discussion. The \u0152 I mean , in particular th-the Jewish press, because the Jewi \u0152 the Jews were always characterized as being cowards. Jews \u0152 Jews didn\u2122t want to be in the military, and Jews were afraid and \u0152 and unreliable, and \u0152 and they\u2122re not really Austrian and so forth, and \u0152 but here was an example where two Jewish boys jumped in the water. We didn\u2122t hesitate, we didn\u2122t ask who it was, we didn\u2122t ask what religion she was. We just acted because we \u0152 we felt we \u0152 we should do something, you see? And I have various correspondence which refers to that particular event, in \u0152 in several organizations wh o got involved. This was in October or \u0152 late October of 1937. One month later I had my Bar Mitzvah, and at the Bar Mitzvah there was a lot of congratulation, because this was only a month later, and the Kultusgemeinde \u0152 the Kultusgemeinde, it\u2122s called a cultural association, but really it\u2122s not a cultural association, i-it was a sort of a semigovernment authority for the Jewish people. And every Jew in Austria had to deal with the Kultusgemeinde at least three times in their lives. The Kultusgemeinde issued the birth certificate, the marriage certificate and the death certificate. So \u0152 so every Jew had to register with the Kultusgemeinde, which later on also turned out to be a detriment for the Jewish people, because when the Nazis came in and wanted a list, all they had to do is go to the Kultusgemeinde and have a list of any Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 16\u0152 of a Jew living anywhere in the city. So at that time the Kultusgemeinde representative came to the temple, and th-they gave me a di-diploma of recognition for what I had done, and \u0152 and also a watch. And this was the first watch that I had ever owned, so \u0152 so to me that \u0152 that was a big deal."

There was only one particular newspaper, it\u2122s called \ufb01 Das Kleine Blatt,\ufb02 which carried a small picture of the two of us, and \u0152 and our age, and our name, and one paragra \u0152 one sentence , actually; and that was it.

And when he read it, h-he showed it to the congressman. And congressman was Whitehurst from Norfolk . He says well \u0152 well, we\u2122ve got to do something, this is not right. So he wrote a letter to the ambassador, giving him a \u0152 a copy of the ar ticle in the newspaper, and that I had never received any recognition. So the ambassador at that time was Thomas Klestil. Thomas Klestil went on from the embassy, the ambassador being there in Washington , to become the foreign minister of Austria. And then, from the foreign ministry, became the president of Austria. So the ambassador said that he had never heard of this, but he was going to investigate."

I \u0152 I don\u2122t know why, but the \u0152 I\u2122ve done that throughout my life, you know, army service, I did things that \u0152 on reflection now, when I think back I says, oh my God, that was dumb. And working \u0152 I\u2122m a pharmacist and we \u0152 we \u0152 we had our own business in Norfolk , Virginia, and in the 80s, I experienced tw o hold-ups, and had a gun to my head twice, you know, and yo u know, people would say, well, were you scared, and so forth. I say, yes, of course I \u0152 I was scared, but \u0152 but it \u0152 but one thing I can tell you, I did not panic. Of course, you know, I\u2122m skipping the story back and forth, Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 22maybe. So \u0152 so the first time that I had a gun to my head, it was by two black men, and they wanted Talwin, which mimics opium, but it wasn\u2122t even a narcotic, and I was astonished when they asked for it, you see. But then he asked for my wallet, so I gave him my wallet. Then he said to me, kneel down. And I said to him, if you\u2122re going to shoot me, you\u2122re going to have to look at me, I\u2122m not kneeling. And he says \u0152 and he says, all right. And he turned around and wa lked \u0152 and ran out. By the way, he got shot and kille d two days later, trying to rob another pharmacy. The second time maybe was \u0152 maybe three \u0152 three weeks later, and this time it was by two whites. And they were more knowledgeable, they were prepared. They came with an empty pillowcase, and they knew \u0152 they probably had shopped us, and they knew where I kept the narcotics. So \u0152 so they wanted the morphine, and the Dilaudid and the Demerol, and the codeine and opium and so forth that we had; so they got all of that. And then, you know, he\u2122s holding a pi stol, while the other one is loading up on \u0152 on whatever we had in narcotics. And then he said to me, ge \u0152 let me have your wallet. So I said to him, let me \u0152 I says, give me \u0152 give you my wallet? I says, do you realize what problems that is? I says, I gotta run here and there to get new identification and new driver\u2122s license. I got to stop all the credit cards, I says, it\u2122s a whole lot of trouble. And so he says, all right, keep the wallet. And people couldn\u2122t believe, you \u0152 you actua lly did that? I says, yes. So, I \u0152 I \u0152 Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 23throughout life, I don\u2122t panic. I-I size up the situation a-as to what I need to do and \u0152 and act accordingly. And \u0152 and I feel that when you panic, then many times the person who is the aggressor, will also panic, and then you don\u2122t know what to expect. People would ask me, they would \u0152 found it strange that the first time that you were held up, you had two blacks, right? Yeah. A nd the second time it was two whites? Yeah. Don\u2122t you find it strange? I says, no, I says, my \u0152 my pharmacy was an equal opportunity pharmacy. So \u0152 so th ey \u0152 they would laugh, it was fun. But after that, I hired the police to come in and \u0152 an-and they were \u0152 every \u0152 every afternoon and evening I woul d have police in \u0152 in the pharmacy, and my sons urged me, you know, it\u2122s time to get out. You kno w, you \u0152 you can\u2122 t keep this up. Because it was true, because you \u0152 you become apprehensive that every time the door opens, you don\u2122t know who is coming in. And the problem with drugs today in America is so \u0152 so pervasive, that you just don\u2122t know what to anticipate. A-And you live and work in a form of tension. So although I was only 59 at the time, I \u0152 I decided to call it quits. I sold the pharmacy and retired at 59. And I took a three month vacation, you know, traveled to Europe; your country, Hungary , I was there for about a month. Enjoyed it. A-And when I came back I was restless and didn\u2122t know what to do, so I went to work for the navy, the navy hospital in the \u0152 as a pharmacist. And I worked until the 90s a-and then I quit a-and stopped working. Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 24"

The \u0152 the cardinal of Austria, Innitzer, welcomed Hitler as, you know, the native son returning to his country and so forth, and \u0152 and it seemed so unbelievable, how overnight something as dramatic a-as a \u0152 as giving away everything and becoming a devoted Nazi, a-and the Jewish people going to be the target, you see, because we Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 30heard it con-consistently, with the editor of the newspapers, or ev \u0152 ev \u0152 everything became pro-Nazis, a-and you saw no opposition whatsoever. Everybody was for the Nazis. And the people were f-for the Nazis. Either that, or afraid, because seemingly 100 percent were not necessarily in favor of what was taking place, but it seemed to be the vast majority were. And the plundering took place, and the beating took place and the dem \u0152 the humiliation took place, you know, all the graffiti that had been anti-Nazi \u0152 they take elderly Jewish people, and sometimes religious people, whoever they were, peop-people of recognition, professional people, you know, and would humiliate them, give him a toothbrush and tell him to scrub the streets and so forth, and spit at them and make fun. And the people would stand around and laugh."

            "question": "We are at the preceding events that are leading up to Kristallnacht.",
            "answer": "On Kristallnacht, no \u0152 November nine, we saw what was going on on the street, that the shops are being plundered, a-and th e Jewish people are \u0152 on the street were being beaten up, so you\u2122re afraid to \u0152 as to what may happen. And the greatest fear was to hear the knock on the door. When you \u0152 when you heard that knock on the door, we froze. And I could see the expressi on on my \u0152 my father and my mother\u2122s face, and I \u0152 and I knew they \u0152 they were scared. And it passes onto the children when you \u0152 wh-when they see that the \u0152 the parents are \u0152 are frightened. And the \u0152 there\u2122s a knock on the door and the order, open up. So, we opened up the door, and to \u0152 two uniformed SA people walked in, one a little older tha-than the other one. The other one licked \u0152 looked to be sa \u0152 someone maybe 18 or 19 years old, something like that. And they demanded to see my brother, specifically asking for ba \u0152 for him by his name, but he was not ho me. So they didn\u2122t believe it, so they went through the apartment, searching for him, and he wasn\u2122t there. So, since he wasn\u2122t there, one of them, the elderly one said, we\u2122ll take him, pointing to me. And it was then that my mother started pleading and crying, saying he is only a little boy, he hasn\u2122t done anything, and please leave him alone, you know \u0152 you know, just begging him. And \u0152 and it was then that the younger SA man said, it wasn\u2122t him. Tha-That\u2122s it, it wasn\u2122t him. And they said oh \u0152 okay, we \u2122ll come back in a Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 32little while. So, when I heard it wasn\u2122t him, a-as I \u0152 I surmised that maybe my brother had gotten into a fight, and now wa s the time to get even, you see. And the mere fact that it wasn\u2122t him, saved me. And because my mother, as soon as they left, told me to run downstairs and intercept my brother from coming home, and telling him to stay with a friend, not to come home. And \u0152 and then she sent me to tell my uncle not to go home, and to st ay with his mother-in-law. That was interesting too, and h-he \u0152 he told me later on, that they came to his mother-in-law\u2122s home, you know, everybody knew alrea dy where most likely somebody would \u0152 would go if you want to pi ck him up. And when he hear d the knock on the door, he crawled under the table, and the table had a long tablecloth. So they were searching the house, the \u0152 the apartment that they lived in, and they didn\u2122t see him. And they were pounding the table, saying well, you be sure to \u0152 to let us know as soon as he comes here. Well, he was under the table. He survived. His wife and his son did not survive. But i-it was, th-the following day, on the 10th of November, when I wa \u0152 was on my way to go to the Palestina(ph) office to check on the \u0152 on my aliyah, which is immigration to then known Palestine or Israel. When I came downstairs, I saw a \u0152 a big truck and a lot of people around the truck jeering and laughing and enjoying themselves. And the police is there also, just standing there. And I was wondering what the heck is going on here, what\u2122s it all about, you know? And \u0152 and Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 33the house right next door to us, there was a shop, a shop carrying bedding equipment, blankets and pillows and pillowcases and towels and stuff like that. And I noticed that they were carrying stuff out from the shop, and putting it on the truck. Well, you recognize right away, it doesn\u2122t ta ke long, as to what \u2122s going on. They\u2122re just confiscating whatever goods he has and putting it on the truck. And then I saw the owner standing there beside the \u0152 the shop. Hi-His name was shp \u0152 H-Herr Schpringer (ph). A Mr. Schpringer(ph). A-And he\u2122s white-faced, scared. And when they had just about emptied the shop, Mr. \u0152 Herr Schpringer (ph), being a business man, walks up to the head honcho Nazi there, and asks for a receipt. And th-the storm trooper turned ar ound and yelled to the crowd, Herr Schpringer(ph) wants a receipt. And everybody starts laughing and cheering and screaming. And then he grabs Schpringer (ph) by the neck, the collar of his neck, and turned him around and gave him a ki ck in the rear, and Schpringer(ph) fell down on the pavement. And he said, here Jew, this is your receipt. I \u0152 I witnessed that. A-And I-I felt that even going to the aliyah office may not be such a good idea. I says \u0152 so I decided to go to the home of the chief rabbi."

I \u0152 spontaneous response to different things. For instance, if I told you I saw Eichmann, and asked him to put a country on my passport, it\u2122s only years later that I even became aware who he was. I had no idea Eichmann, I never heard of him. But I went to \u0152 to the Rothschild palace, which was the Nazi headquarters, and I walked in there \u0152 well, when you walk in there, everything is heil Hitler, you know, an-and I\u2122m not going to come in and say heil Hitler, so wha-what am I going to say? Gr\u00fcss gott. Which was the way we normally greeted each other, gr\u00fcss gott, and \u0152 greet God. And \u0152 and everybody looks up, you know, what\u2122s this Jewish kid doing here? You see, so I asked \u0152 when Eichmann asked me what it is I want, and I told him, I need to get a country entered \u0152 because I ca \u0152 I can\u2122t remember exactly what \u0152 you had to choose on the passport what country y ou n \u0152 had to have on the passport.

            "answer": "Oh, orig \u0152 originally had planned to go, th-then I said to myself, no, no, this may be too dangerous. So \u0152 so I went to \u0152 actually, it wasn\u2122t that night either, on recollection. I \u0152 I went \u0152 I did go to the aliyah office. I\u2122m sorry, I had to correct myself. I went to the aliyah office, a-and when I came there, it was packed with people; men and women. And I wasn \u2122t there very long when the SS showed up, and they sent men to one side, and the women and children to the other side. And I had had my Bar Mitzvah, so it came up to me to decide which side should I go on? And I felt that maybe I better play it safe. So I decided to go with the women, although you know, people who had ha d their Bar Mitzvah, they regard themselves already as men. But, you know, I \u0152 I says, I \u0152 I bett er play it safe. And it wasn\u2122t very long thereafter, when we had separated and we we re in different rooms, that all the men were taken away by truck. And later on I learned that they had been taken to Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 37Dachau . Had I stayed with the men, I would have wound up in Dachau , but I was with the women. So they kept us there for an hour, an hour and a half, til they decided what to do with us, what \u0152 they let us go. And here again comes the recklessness. They let us go, and I\u2122m going out on the s \u0152 from the building. So I thought that more and more men will be coming to the building, and they\u2122re gonna get arrested, and maybe I ought to warn them. But in back of me, there\u2122s an SS man, right in the building. If you\u2122ve been to Vienna, I am \u0152 the building is still there, and it\u2122s not far \u0152 the Hotel Metropol was Gestapo headquarters. It\u2122s only one block away. And maybe two blocks away is the Kultusgemeinde on the Juden \u0152 on the Judengasse. So this was in the \u0152 on the \u0152 on the Aurelia street, you see, which on \u0152 only short walk where the aliyah office was. Years later I took my wife there and I showed her where it was. A-And so I stood at the edge of the \u0152 the pavement \u0152 pedes \u0152 pedestrian paveme nt, not the street, and as men were approaching me to go into the building, I would turn my head away and say, don\u2122t go in, Gestapo. And invariably, they woul d say, what did you say? And I would repeat, you know, but not looking directly at him, as if I \u0152 but the Gestapo in back of me was a trooper, noticed that people we re coming up to me and turned around and walking away. So a-after three or four had done this, he comes out and yells for me to come back. And he wants to know, what did you say to the men? Was hast Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 38du gesagt? I says, I didn\u2122t say anything, I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I said I \u0152 oh, you said something. I said, the only thing I said was I was here for some time and I just got out. That I waited a long time, but I just got out. That\u2122s not what you said, tell me what you said. So I stuck by my story. So yeah, they \u0152 he wanted \u0152 he really beat me, and then he kicked me down the steps. There were about three steps as \u0152 as you entered the building. So I fell over the three steps, and I got up, and I ran away."

So I went to see Israel Taglicht, a rabbi asr \u0152 Israel Taglicht , who was the chief rabbi of Vienna.

And it was all about a Kindertransport. And, I don\u2122t know what he\u2122s talking about. So when he put the phone down, I says, what \u0152 what is the Kindertransport ? So he explained to me that he is in negotiation with Eichmann. He didn\u2122t say Eichmann, he said the Nazis. He did not know whethe r he\u2122s gonna be successful or not, but the idea is to have a transport of 1,000 children; 800 would go to England , the first 800. The last 200 would be dropped off in Holland. And he said to me, I don\u2122t know whether we will be successful in negotiation with Nazi authorities, he says, but if you like, he says, I\u2122ll put your name on the list. So I said yes, what I got to lose, I says, yeah, put my name on the list, and I didn\u2122t think anything o-of \u0152 more about it.

I don\u2122t know what\u2122s going on. I\u2122m at this place in Dovercourt in Lowestoft(ph), freezing cold. I mean, this cabin, no running water. Every bit of clothing that I had, I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m putting it on at night, trying to stay warm, and \u0152 because we\u2122re right on the ocean, and this wintertime. I couldn\u2122t stay warm. So aft \u0152 they gave us sort of a canister, was supposed to be filled with hot water, and \u0152 and when I woke up in the morning the second night, it was \u0152 it was frozen ice.

So \u0152 so I just took the blanket, and I went into the dining hall, and there they had a fireplace, and I put the blanket on the floor. And for the rest of the time that I was at this camp, I slept on the floor in front of the dining place, ju-just ha-had to stay warm. But this is a different story now. As far as my uncle is concerned, he writes to me from time to time that he \u0152 he also has no money, and he\u2122s hungry. And then in one letter he\u2122s saying that \u0152 now that you\u2122re safe and out of the country, it\u2122s your responsibility to help me, to help me get out of the country. Well \u0152 well, I get this letter, a-and then o-on a \u0152 on a personal note from my mother, she\u2122s getting, as time goes on, mo re worried and more concerned. My father is in United States, a good looking man, and maybe it went on in her head Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 49that maybe he\u2122s met somebody, which later on I hear, was not that unusual. So sh \u0152 the pressure went on, with me caught in the middle. She\u2122s writing to me that he\u2122s not doing anything to help her get out of the country. In the meantime, he\u2122s in this country, he doesn\u2122t speak English. He doesn\u2122t know who is what, or where to go or what do you do. He doesn\u2122t have any money either. He\u2122s dependent upon the assistance from \u0152 from the distant cousins who have no relation whatso-whatsoever. I don\u2122t know what their finances were at the time. So, you know, one letter I get, that I should write to my father, that if he doesn\u2122t do something to help my mother to get out of the country, that I should write to him \u0152 oh, she said, send a cable \u0152 hhow am I gonna send a cable \u0152 tha-that I w ould have nothing to do with him, if he wasn\u2122t more active in helping. I realized the situation she\u2122s in, I \u0152 I don\u2122t know what\u2122s going on. So I wrote him what she told me. And then I get a letter from my father, that this is no way to talk to me. A-And you know, I \u0152 I\u2122m in the middle of this thing, in the \u0152 in the back and forth, and you know, th \u0152 i-it was for me a very, very uncomfortable and stressful and it\u2122s \u0152 if you can put yourself in the situation where \u0152 where you are put in th e situation of choosing between your father or your mother, I mean how \u0152 how do you do this? A-A-And \u0152 an d \u0152 and who is right and who is wrong, an-and what\u2122s going on? I don\u2122t know. Bu-But you ask me to do this, all right, I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll do it. You see, so \u0152 but I mean, th-that has always bothered me Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 50that \u0152 that I wrote that letter. And I \u0152 he s \u0152 my father berated me, that this no way to talk to me, and it was disrespectful. But i-it was \u0152 you know, the war broke out and my mother is still over there, and finally she did get an affidavit, cause America and Germany, there was still correspondence going on because America was not at war in \u212239.

A-And so the \u0152 from one office to the other, to wind up with Eichmann, I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I did hear, when he was tried in Israel that he made some claim that on occasi on he tried to save Jews. I mean, that was par \u0152 so-some small part of his defens e. But he did o \u0152 also admit that one Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 54mistake that he made was that he slapped L\u00f6wenherz. And tha-that he \u0152 he apologized for having slapped his face, because he had much respect for L\u00f6wenherz, and \u0152 and L\u00f6wenherz survived. And by the way, ma-many people felt that L\u00f6wenherz was a collaborator. I spoke to his son, his son survived, and I was able to get ahold of him, lived in New York, name \u0152 changed his name to Lavary(ph). I have a letter that he sent me, talking about his father and how glad he was to hear from me, because I had written to him and told him about the father, and \u0152 the father being responsible for my sur-surviving. And he says, the father would have been happy to hear from me. And he put me in touch with his daughter, who lives in California, and she\u2122s a professor at one of the universities there, and he \u0152 he felt that the daughter should hear my story. So we got the daughter to call me, and we were in a conference phone call, and I told her story, and then she \u0152 because the father was criticized for having supplied the lists to the Nazi authorities, who were then picked up and deported. Ho w else do you find out who lives where? But they had the information. My knowledge of L\u00f6wenherz, he had no choice. So \u0152 so they\u2122re gonna get that list no matter what. He\u2122s not the only one who knows where the lists are. So if they kill him [indecipherable] so \u0152 so he is in a difficult situation. Might \u0152 you might also find of interest that the rabbi at my Bar Mitzvah was Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein. There you have a different story. He was part Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 55of the Judenrat in Vienna, and then he became part of the Judenrat at Theresienstadt. It is reported that he acted shamefully, that he molested women, and if they didn\u2122t cooperate, he\u2122d put them on the list to be deported. There are books written about his deed. He too survived, and wound up in Italy. They wanted \u0152 many of the people who knew hi m from \u0152 who also had survived Theresienstadt wanted to hang him up. He a \u0152 with the church\u2122s help, he wound up in Rome , and the Vatican supposedly helped him, and he started working for the Vatican, and he died in Italy. And the wife wanted to have him buried in the Jewish cemetery, and they refused. And with the Vatican intercession, to cooperate or to yield or whatever, so \u0152 so they agreed, but only at the edge of the cemetery. I understand that there is some sort of a custom th at if you are an apostate, or you\u2122ve done something disrespectful to the Jewish peopl e, they let you be buried in the Jewish cemetery, but away from everybody, only at the edge. So that is where he\u2122s buried, in Italy. That\u2122s the story of the rabbi, Benjamin mermu \u0152 Benjamin Murmelstein. And I have \u0152 I can\u2122t remember the name of the book, but there\u2122s a \u0152 a book written about the \u0152 the Judenrat, he was the head of the camp at Theresienstadt, and he s \u0152 replaced Edelman , who was the former head. And Edelman, before being deported, advised the committee there, don\u2122t trust Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 56Murmelstein.

I don\u2122t know if \u0152 you didn\u2122t write down the name. Benjamin Murmelstein. I still have the Bar Mitzvah book that I received. That\u2122s another story. It was about two or three days before we left. We had to take our suitcases and to have it inspected by the Gestapo. And you were not allowed to take any money, you \u2122re not allowed to take any cameras, no jewelry, nothing of any value. You \u0152 a-anything in your possession had to be in your possession as of \u212237, as I mentioned earlier. No \u0152 no typewriters, nothing \u0152 no musical instruments, an-and the only thing that was not listed was books. And since it wasn\u2122t listed, I felt, you know, I always liked books, and the nicest present you could give me for my Bar Mitzvah would be a book. So, I \u0152 I had received quite a few books, so I put them in a suitcase. And when we went to the Kultusgemeinde , where we had taken our suitcase to, the Gestapo agent said, what\u2122s with these books? And my mother said, well, he likes to read. He doesn\u2122t need them. So he started \u0152 took some of the books and tossed them all out. You know, just threw them away, but he left some books there. And one of the books he\u2122d left was the Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 57Bar Mitzvah boy \u0152 prayer book, which I s till have, with the date and everything. Another document. German Bar Mitzvah pr ayer book. So where are we in the story?"

            "answer": "O-Only my mother. My father was \u0152 oh, she felt my father may be arrested, you know, so he \u0152 because fo-for a while he just didn\u2122t leave the house. So it was \u0152 I-I had no idea what to expect, but when w \u0152 wh en we got there, each child had to be dropped off at the foot of the steps. That was in the requirement that we had received, as to what procedure to follow for the transport, and \u0152 and we were to arrive at a certain hour, and in my case late in the evening. The child had to be drop off at the steps of the foot o-of the entrance. The parent was not allowed on the platform. Only one parent could come, a nd we would be given a number, and that was it. A-And now we arriving at the station. And there are hundreds of parents with a child, and well, I\u2122m almost 14, only one day away. This is a \u0152 late in \u0152 at night, on the 10th of December, and I\u2122m listening to some of the conversation that was going on, you know, with the \u0152 the conversation between my mother a-and me, we \u0152 we \u0152 we knew what to accept. I wanted to be part of it, my mother wanted me out of the country, so it was, write to me, we\u2122ll get together, we\u2122ll be okay an-and Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 58so forth, and you know, my \u0152 each \u0152 each one encouraging the other, y-you see, so \u0152 so I\u2122m not \u0152 I \u0152 I recognize what is taking place, but I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m not emotionally carried away, because I know we\u2122re gonna meet up again, you know. My father, a month later is leaving, so I know we\u2122re gonna get together some \u0152 at some time. When or what, of course, we had no idea. But I\u2122m listening to what goes on around me, which I found very heartrending. I had no idea that on this transport would be children between two and 16. And the conver sation of some of these children, four, five, six years old, they had no idea what was taking place, and what \u0152 why they were there and where they were going and why they were going an-and \u0152 and are you not coming with me, or \u0152 or I don\u2122t want to go, I want to stay. You don\u2122t love me, or \u0152 I get emotional even today when I talk about it because at the time I \u0152 I was not as em-emotionally affected as I am now, because now I have children and grandchildren and I don\u2122t know if I woul d have the courage of the parents, the sacrifice that they made, to take a kid at that age and send him away. I-It took a lot of guts, I mean, cause I don\u2122t want you to worry, or write to me, or we\u2122ll soon get together, and it\u2122s all fabricated. They don\u2122t know. And as finally happened, close to 90 percent of the children never saw their pa rents again. So i-it \u0152 it was a very, very stressful period. A-And you know, give them a number, I \u0152 you know, my number was thr \u0152 325, so I knew I was going to England \u0152 because until then I didn\u2122t even Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 59know where I was going for sure. So \u0152 so I knew I was going to England . And they took the younger children, they put them in one wagon, the older children in another wagon. And the girls in one wagon, th e boys in another wagon, so \u0152 and I remember on the \u0152 f-for the \u0152 for the most part we had a certain amount of fear as to what was going to happen, even on the train, whenever it stopped and the Nazi personnel came on an-and then they walked through and \u0152 because they could kick you off the train, you know. Somebody \u0152 there was a rumor that somebody was taken off the train. If there was or wasn\u2122t, I have no idea, you know, rumor circulates. So we had some social workers from the Kultusgemeinde who came with us and they had \u0152 they were going to be allowed to leave the country, but their family was held hostage, they had to return. And we a-arrived to the [indecipherable] i-in \u0152 late \u0152 late at night, after a day and a half of traveling on the train, we arrived in Holland and the train stopped on the German side first, and they inspected, and whatever and then they let the train proceed across the border. And once we crossed the border all hell broke loose, and everybody started yelling and screaming and cheering and you know, be cause now we knew we were free; no longer to be afraid of the Nazis or what they could do. And I remember people coming up to the train and th-they offered us drinks and \u0152 and sandwiches and so forth, a very friendly reception i-in Holland. And after a little while, I-I was so tired Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 60from the day and a half on th \u0152 on the train that I \u0152 I-I could \u0152 I could barely stay awake. So \u0152 so all I remember is I got on this boat and th e crossing of the channel is very stormy, I \u0152 and I got motion sick. I\u2122d never been on any ocean, I \u0152 first time I \u0152 I\u2122m seeing an ocean. And in the morning the \u0152 the next morning we \u0152 we arrived in Harwich, England, and I faintly remember \u0152 I don\u2122t know how \u0152 being taken to Lowestoft(ph) in Dovercourt. And there I stayed maybe three weeks, something like that, and my \u0152 my problem started, I was there three weeks then \u0152 then they \u0152 they sent me to Ipswich , and I was there 10 days, and being \u0152 and then I went to another place, it was a convalescent home for sick people, and \u0152 and in each time i-i-in the \u0152 in Dovercourt every weekend, they \u0152 they would line us up and \u0152 and people would come down a-and pick out certain children. And you know, I asked them what\u2122s going on? These are people that \u0152 private people want to take a child in their home. But I noticed that whenever they picked anybody out, they wanted a small, small, young children. Nobody want ed to get a teenager, you see, so nobody picked me. So \u0152 so I was goi ng to this convalescent home, and then I went another place. Each time I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m staying a week or two, or three weeks, and then I go another place, and then finally I was sen \u0152 we went to a place called \u0152 they always cut down the number of boys, always \u0152 you know, th \u0152 by then, I think we\u2122re down to a dozen boys a-and \u0152 and we\u2122re going to a \u0152 San Remo hotel in Margate , near \u0152 Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 61near Dover. And th-that was sort of a family run hotel, small hotel, and I really liked it. I said oh, this is beautiful. I sa \u0152 th-the ocean, a-and \u0152 and it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s gotten warmer and the food is great, and we were there maybe two and a half weeks, and the proprietor tells us that you\u2122ll have to leave, you know, some other place. I says, why, I says, you know, we like it here. We said, we want \u0152 I want to stay here, I said, this is \u0152 this is very nice. He said, I\u2122m very sorry, but I can\u2122t support a group of boys and nobody pays us. So that was th e first time that I realized that \u0152 what was going on. That we\u2122re being shifted fro m one place to the other. Maybe they said, all right, I\u2122ll take them for a few da ys, and so forth, you see, but nobody was paying anybody, you see, so these people were \u0152 were offering to house some \u0152 some boys until they realized that th \u0152 they\u2122ll have to make room for us, and there\u2122s certain expense involved, and \u0152 and you \u0152 there\u2122s no funds available."

And you know, I was his favorite and this and that and \u0152 but nos \u0152 I had had the medical training in the States and I had been made to believe that I would wind up in some Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 83sort of a hospital facility in the Pacific. So I looked forward to that, working in the hospital, fine. And we were on the water over a month, maybe five weeks on the water. Can you imagine? And if you read th e description there, it was a freighter that had been converted into a troop ship. And we were, as I say there, packed in like sardines, thousands of troops, and one on top of the other, we stacked on \u0152 on sort of a canvas bunk a-an \u0152 and \u0152 and there\u2122s non \u0152 you can\u2122t turn around, because it\u2122s so close, and you got to climb up a for \u0152 four or five high, as to whe \u0152 where you\u2122re gonna stay, a-an \u0152 a-and if you \u0152 you take a shower, but it\u2122s salt water, and there\u2122s no way that you can lather yourself in soap water, it just doesn\u2122t work. So \u0152 so it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s always sticky, and you ya \u0152 and you feel crummy. And th \u0152 an-and \u0152 an-an-and it\u2122s the same clothes, yo \u0152 you know, and ther e\u2122s no change of clothes. A-And you feel real miserable. You get \u0152 iin the \u0152 in this article I saw it was a \u0152 a preparation for jungle warfare. But we were about five weeks on the water. Today you can fly over there in one day. But when I \u0152 we landed in [indecipherable] and I was there maybe a little over a week and then was back on the ship again, and where we going? Everything was always secret, nobody knew. I mean, who am I gonna tell? You see, but I was on \u0152 on the \u0152 even on the first sh \u0152 o-on the first troop ship [break] Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 84"

So I made reference to that in \u0152 in the article that I hope you\u2122ll find of interest, and wound up in [indecipherable] and then I\u2122m put onto anot her troopship, and again, I ha \u0152 I don\u2122t have the faintest idea. But they have a roster and one day I\u2122m being told that there was watch duty. Watch duty you are on the deck with a rifle, and for about two hours \u0152 two hours off and \u0152 and fo ur hours off. I mean, two hours on and four hours off. A-And I see my list as being chosen for on \u0152 for \u0152 for on duty. I says, wait a minute, I says, I\u2122m a medic. We don\u2122t carry weapons. I says, why \u0152 why \u0152 so \u0152 so I says, wait a minute, there\u2122 s a mistake here. I don\u2122t do anything with weapons. So the officer says to me, well, I don\u2122t anything about what you tell me, I have nothing here about medic here. He sa ys, you in the infantry. I says, no. Well \u0152 well, that\u2122s your assignment. That\u2122s the first time that I heard anything about the infantry."

            "answer": "No, we-well, yes, i-i-in basic training you receive \u0152 but \u0152 but not with weapons, if you\u2122re a medic. One time the \u0152 they took us out and we fired a machine gun and I Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 85fired the \u0152 a carbine and an M-1 rifle, yeah, I fired one time. But th \u0152 but how to clean it, how to handle it [indecipherable] no \u0152 no extensive training. Yeah, that one time it was a wa \u0152 how to disarm so mebody who comes to \u0152 at you with a \u0152 with a bayonet on the rifle. How to disarm that person. That\u2122s a-another story. But I was assigned as a medic to the infantry, and from day one I hated it. It is \u0152 first of all, the living conditions were so terrible. The food was horrible. Ev-Everything was powdered, we \u0152 we got nothing fresh. You living in the jungle, a-and you know, i-insects crawling all over you. And you know, I\u2122m a city boy, I\u2122m \u0152 you can\u2122t take a bath, y-yo-yo-you know, it\u2122s a \u0152 it takes weeks to get a letter. A-And we were not directly \u0152 at least I was not directly involved in \u0152 in combat, but we \u0152 we got the wounded, and \u0152 an-and my job was prin cipally thr-three directions; overcome shock, hemorrhage and fractur es. A-And you learn, it\u2122s amazing. Really, you know, I was astonished how much you can learn just by watching what somebody else does, and then sometimes having somebo dy who knows, come over and \u0152 and work with you, and so you learn those things. How to apply traction, and how to apply support, and sa \u0152 and put on a cast and a ll that. You know, you learn that, because later on, toward the end of the war, I was assigned to, you know, shipped to Hawaii, a-and \u0152 and there I became an instructor and the draft was still going on, and new recruits were coming in and I was lecturing in \u0152 in two subjects \u0152 three Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 86subjects; sanitation, first aid and venereal diseases. And I always started off my lecture in venereal diseases, telling them that many times \u0152 at that time, when you got a venereal disease, you could be court-martialed a nd put into prison. You may not know this, and it\u2122s totally different today, but then, you know \u0152 so \u0152 so \u0152 so gonorrhea was a major problem to \u0152 to many, and disab ling, and because it\u2122s so infectious. So \u0152 so I wou \u0152 I would start o ff my \u0152 my lecture with contrary to what you may have been told, that you cannot catch gonorrhea off a toilet seat, I want to assure you that that is incorrect. It is possible to get gonorrhea off a toilet seat, but it\u2122s a hell of a place to take your girlfrie nd. You see, because many times, when you asked a soldier, how did you get this? You see, oh, I don\u2122t know, maybe off a toilet seat, you know. It\u2122s really nonsense, you see it was \u0152 so but this was \u0152 got a big laugh, and \u0152 and \u0152 and I would have the a ttention of the audience. A-And when the war had ended, but I was still in Hawaii, and troops were being repatriated back to the country, I asked the commanding officer if he will authorize me to go to the university there, so he said okay. So I went to the \u0152 for a little while to the University of Hawaii . An-And then when I came back, I-I \u0152 you know, I thought I\u2122d become a doctor, until one day I met a guy who had graduated from high school with me, and you know, hi Herb, you know, Phil, how are you doing? We start talking to each other, where \u0152 what are you doing now? I says, well, I\u2122m going to Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 87college park, I\u2122ve been accepted to be pre-med. So he says, why do you want to go to pre-med? He says, you know, when you finish it, what do you got? Nothing. Then you still gotta go to med school, right? I says yeah, of course. He says, well, why don\u2122t you go to pharmacy school? I says , why should I go to pharmacy? I want to become \u0152 he says, no, he says, you use that as your pre-med. And this way you at least have a degree as a pharmacist and you \u0152 and you can work during the summer and then pay for medical sc hool \u0152 because I had no money. So I thought it was a good idea. The \u0152 the problem was that it was mid-August and school starts in September. So \u0152 so, how do I get in? Because at that time so many thousands of soldiers came out, an-and they all wanted to go into \u0152 applied to Hopkins . Hopkins turned me down and said, reapply next ye ar. Well, you\u2122re not going to sit around for a whole year. Now I\u2122m in my 20s, 21 or 22 years old. So I \u0152 you know, I\u2122ve \u0152 I thought about it, I says, you know, it\u2122s not a bad idea, but would I get in? So \u0152 so I-I went there, and I asked to meet th-the de an of admission, was a elderly woman. And she gave me the same answer, she says, we \u0152 we can admit you next year, but our classes are closed. I don\u2122t think it\u2122s gonna be possible. She says, well, if somebody last minute doesn\u2122t want to come in, you know, maybe. I\u2122ll give you an application, she says, but I wouldn\u2122t bet on it. I-I-I don\u2122t think that it\u2122s gonna be possible. So I said to her \u0152 her name was Kohl(ph). I-I-I said, Dean Kohl (ph), if you admit me, Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 88I\u2122ll come back and kiss you. The whole of \u0152 the whole office there overheard this conversation, they all burst out laughing. But I got in."

And \u0152 and then gradually we heard that his son, my cousin, he was 18 years old, he was killed in Auschwitz. And the most difficult thing for my mother was to learn that the husbands of her sisters and the children had survived , but the sisters had not. A-And mentally, she was finished after this. I-It was \u0152 life at home was o \u0152 was, from then on was very, very difficult. Later on when the \u0152 I \u0152 I went ba ck into the army, by the way, during the Korean War, an-and became a commissioned officer. But \u0152 and we lived in Virginia for 40 years, but every time I went hom e, all I had to do was open the door an-and \u0152 and it was \u0152 she\u2122d talk about the brother and the sister , and the brother and the sister and why and this and that. An-And a certain regret. It\u2122s just difficult. She should have left me in England and should have worked on getting out the brother. I was safe. And maybe she c ould have helped the brother at that time. And I \u0152 I Interview with Herbert Friedman October 17, 2010 89knew she was right. So \u0152 so you carry that burden, you know, am I responsible, you know, and \u0152 you know, I just \u0152 could I ha ve done something, you know, who \u0152 who \u0152 about my uncle, who should I have talked to? I mean, I didn\u2122t know anybody, I \u0152 you know, where, what? I mean, I don\u2122t ev en know where \u0152 where is he? What\u2122s the address, you know?

I don\u2122t know what\u2122s happening to me from day to \u0152 one to the next day, so \u0152 so how am I \u0152 well, but \u0152 but you have that complex of guilt, you know, that he is my friend, I didn\u2122t do anything for him. A-AAnd then you hear about the other kids, a million and a half, you know, and I survived and they didn\u2122t. And why did I survive? A-And you know, for many years, while I was busy working in the off \u0152 in the \u0152 in the pharmacy, and my wi fe can tell you, I was okay. It was when I stopped working that all this came back to me, a-and it to \u0152 to this day, you know, I\u2122m very much troubled. And \u0152 and for a while, I had to get some help.
