And then when we got down to \u2014 near Austria, as a \u2014 as I told you, General Patton was the Third Army commander, and \u2014 and instructions were that we weren\u2019t supposed to go into Austria. But Patton didn\u2019t like \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t like that, and so we went into austr \u2014 Austria also. And that\u2019s where \u2014 okay, and as I said, the Russians were supposed to take over the \u2014 Austria, and \u2014 and Interview with Gilbert Waganheim \u201c January 13, 2015 Patton didn\u2019t like the \u2014 the Russians either.

And the reason they \u2014 they wanted \u2014 they \u2014 they gave up to us, is they didn\u2019t want the Russians, because the Russians would \u2014 would \u2014 would just kill them.

And of course, what I observed was piles of shoes, piles of other things. And course, lot of dead bodies. And then I went into the \u2014 into the camp, and I went into a particular \u2014 wait a minute, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m losing words. But I went in and I spoke with some of the survivors.
