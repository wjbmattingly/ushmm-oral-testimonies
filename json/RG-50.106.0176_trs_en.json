My father and my Uncle Ruvin, when -- when rumors started to come up that bad things -- that there was a threat -- rumors of threat were in the air, and my father and his -- and -- and my Uncle Ruvin actually started to moo -- to try to get into 6 Russia and then maybe bring the families with them. But a lot of Jews were going east to Russia, even though they knew it was no picnic and they\u2122d wind up in Siberia very often. But for some reason they couldn\u2122t get in and they were turned back and they came back into town and then eventually, when the Germans began to round up all able-bodied men and take them away for labor, and we never heard from them again. And -- and my mother variously said -- I still don\u2122t know and I still want to do some research in the newly opened ar-archives in Germany that he -- they were killed in Chelmno in the extermination camp, or whatever. But meanwhile we were left behind in the town and when -- one day -- and I don\u2122t remember, I wish my mother were around now to fill in the gaps, we -- she got wind that there was going to be some action against the Jews. So my mother alerted her brothers and sisters -- and sister and -- and my grandmother, and we left and ran away to the woods surrounding that town. And we remained -- that was the beginning of our period in the forests of the Ukraine, which lasted for a bit over two years, living -- if you\u2122ve seen the movie \ufb01Defiance\ufb02, living in holes in the ground or in huts made out of branches, but also moving around.

Sometimes -- we didn\u2122t have Jewish partisan groups like you -- you had sometimes further north in Lithuania, per se, but we met up with a number of different non-Jewish partisan groups. And they weren't all friendly. And -- but I do begin to remember -- you know, it\u2122s hard to distinguish sometimes what you\u2122ve dreamed and what stories you\u2122ve integrated from other people.

I developed -- because I was an infant, I was what, less than two years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death, I mean, I -- s - you know, so my mother took me to a field hospital, miles away, where the Russians treated -- th-the partisans and the military had a field hospital and she wanted them to treat me and -- and the officer in charge says look at all the people, we have soldiers in there and I don\u2122t have time for -- for you.

And some of the people, because you would -- you would have to leave -- you were in the forest. The forest was both safety, but it was also deprivation. Safety in the sense that organized armies don\u2122t go into forests. Not out of fear, but you know, it\u2122s -- you -- you just don\u2122t. I mean, you don\u2122t bring in tanks and armor and what have you into forests. So you -- you -- so people can hide in a forest.

But of course that 9 presupposed that the -- th-the peasant you were going to was not going to sell you out and was not going to inform the Germans that you were there.

So they would dig a ditch -- ditches on the outskirts of the town and when the bomb -- when the sky was lit up by these lights, the planes would come over and the search lights would go up, you know, to look for the planes and stuff, you would be running, the civilians would be running to the outskirts of town to these ditches and would, you know, jump in them and you\u2122d sit there, you know, hoping they wouldn\u2122t have a stray bomb hit you on the head, and seeing these planes, you got, you know, all the stuff going on around you.

It doesn\u2122t mean that when you\u2122re traveling to a foreign country you don\u2122t experience a certain discomfort at not knowing the language, oh -- but you -- it\u2122s different. If you have -- don\u2122t grow up with that, and if you\u2122ve missed it for the first 10 years of your life, it\u2122s very hard to replace something like that, and it means you carry it with you into all sorts of situations. It may take you a little bit longer to adjust to a particular thing, or may -- you know. But you do carry it with you and it\u2122s not that you can\u2122t -- you know, we learn to articulate certain things and we become aware of them, but that doesn\u2122t mean that they -- there aren\u2122t certain predispositions that remain there. And I think that -- that 48 happens, and I -- and I know about it, bu -- you know, and -- and -- and also attempts I made to overcome it. I -- I had a job for ORT, wonderful organization that did a lot for Jewish youngsters like me in the camps. I remember ORT and I rem -- when I wa -- came for the interview with ORT, the m-man interviewing me, who was David Dubinsky\u2122s son-in-law, Shelley Appleton, a wonderful man, and Shelley said -- asked me what I knew about ORT. I said, I don\u2122t know anything about your American organization, nothing whatsoever. But I said, I do remember it. I remember the ORT workshops from my childhood. That impressed him.

If y -- if y -- if you didn\u2122t develop it by a certain a -- it\u2122s hard to replace it and it does have -- leave an impact, cause that\u2122s what I talked about, leaving a scar.

My aunt, however, has dementia so I can\u2122t ask her anything and I\u2122m -- and we don\u2122t have a family so I was on the phone with my cousin Menachem\u2122s daughter, who is now 50. And of course she wants to know her history. I 64 said, we gotta do a family tree. But now it means filling in gaps, you know. So we lost that historical thread. That\u2122s why I do appreciate the kind of work you\u2122re doing here and what, you know, what everybody does. It\u2122s -- it\u2122s fabulous."

I am interested, I mean in -- in one respect, I do want to do something about filling in the gaps in my own family history, just so -- so my kids and my grandkids will know. And it\u2122s something we all fall prey to, I have a -- a vanity book that I have downstairs that it was given to me by a man who was -- when Reagan was president [indecipherable] very wealthy man from a s -- Iraqi Jewish banking family. I mean a billionaire. And he gave me a signed copy of his book, and he sa id it\u2122s a history of his family. I said why\u2122d you do it? And of course he, you know, he hired somebody to write it for him. He said, because I want my children and grandchildren to know where they were coming from. So I said wow, this 65 guy\u2122s a billionaire, if he -- he -- but he also delayed. It happens to all of us, you know, so I feel I delayed, I mean, I should have started this process and -- and -- and your call was important in that, it really was."

            "answer": "Leon Wieseltier of the \ufb01New Republic\ufb02 was my campus rep, to give you an idea. I had a good -- the one talent I think I had was sizing people up. My mother was interested in a business career for me. My grandmother, Yiddishkeit, so I combined the two of them, became a Jewish fundraiser. I said, this is like. My religion, I would say was transi -- a religious sensitivity, if you will, was transmitted by these two women, but also by the Yeshiva, and by some of the teachers I had in Yeshiva, more importantly. The -- the -- my mother\u2122s and grandmother\u2122s may have been tinged a bit with superstition, which also comes from that part of [indecipherable]. I -- I\u2122ve always -- I\u2122ve -- one of my good buddies who is also one of my former kids, ise -- I -- in 66 quotation marks. I just -- he\u2122s a very successful lawyer in New York whom we just had dinner with. And he and I would always argue cause his grandfather was very important to him, his -- his grandfather was from Lithuania though, so they were the midnagdin. I came from there, I said Ukraine was the birthplace of Hasidism, right? There\u2122s always a little bit of -- you know, Hasidim are emotional and the others are rational and intellectual. I got the emotional part from my mother and grandmother and if you will, the rational part from some of my rabbis. I am religious. Was I -- but I was also angry at God. And I had this discussion with my oldest and best friend Gil, cause he\u2122ll always say -- we\u2122ll have conversa -- I -- I have used reference points from Genesis and from different books of the Bible, and he\u2122ll say how come you remember this stuff? I don\u2122t remember anything. And he says -- he always said he was a non-believer. And I said to him once, because he was talking wi -- full of anger at God, I said, are you sure you don\u2122t believe? Because if you\u2122re angry at God, presupposes that you believe. So I was angry at God. No doubt about it, and still am from time to time. But that doesn\u2122t preclude the fact, quite the opposite, it affirms it. And -- and th -- th -- I had -- one privilege I had and I -- I told you I had great experience working in -- in -- and when I was working as a college -- I was really a field organizer. I took around some wonderful people. I\u2122d come back all excited at the end of the day. So one of the guys I took around was Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, I don\u2122t know if you know -- familiar with him. And I -- this is many years, it was probably his first trip to America. And they said, take him around to Jewish Day Schools or whatever. And I came back and I told Joyce, I said, [indecipherable] this blew my mind, you know? And I only dealt with bright peop -- they\u2122re all bright, you know what I mean, th -- you know. So I said, but he -- he -- I still remember what he said. He said, I would rather, when I\u2122m working with students, I\u2122d rather work with somebody 67 who is angry at God than somebody who is indiffere nt to God. Because if he says he -- if he\u2122s angry, he cares, and I can turn that around. If he\u2122s indifferent it\u2122s much tougher. So in that sense, yeah, I mean I felt myself like a lot of other Jewish people and kids especially, felt myself victimized, then abandoned and all of that. On the other hand, you know, go -- ge -- God can be the source of your anger, in a sense, or the object of your anger, but can also be a sense of your regeneration of spirit."
