And she said he was quite sympathetic to the Jews, but was removed at some -- at some point. My father and my Uncle Ruvin, when -- when rumors started to come up that bad things -- that there was a threat -- rumors of threat were in the air, and my father and his -- and -- and my Uncle Ruvin actually started to moo -- to try to get into Russia and then maybe bring the families with them. But a lot of Jews were going east to Russia, even though they knew it was no picnic and they\u2019d wind up in Siberia very often. But for some reason they couldn\u2019t get in and they were turned back and they came back into town and then eventually, when the Germans began to round up all able-bodied men and take them away for labor, and we never heard from them again. And -- and my mother variously said -- I still don\u2019t know and I still want to do some research in the newly opened ar-archives in Germany that he -- they were killed in Chelmno in the extermination camp, or whatever. But meanwhile we were left behind in the town and when -- one day -- and I don\u2019t remember, I wish my mother were around now to fill in the gaps, we -- she got wind that there was going to be some action against the Jews. So my mother alerted her brothers and sisters -- and sister and -- and my grandmother, and we left and ran away to the woods surrounding that town. And we remained -- that was the beginning of our period in the forests of the Ukraine, which lasted for a bit over two years, living- if you\u2019ve seen the movie \u201cDefiance\u2019\u2019, living in holes in the ground or in huts made out of branches, but also moving around. People think it was a stationary, you s -- you settled down in one place, no, you didn\u2019t settle down in one place, you moved to -- from dangerous places to safer places.

So there was other stragglers, other civilians, Jews, but in our peregrinations we also wound up meeting with partisan groups eventually, sometimes hostile and sometimes friendly. Sometimes -- we didn\u2019t have Jewish partisan groups like you -- you had sometimes further north in Lithuania, per se, but we met up with a number of different non-Jewish partisan groups. And they weren't all friendly. And -- but I do begin to remember -- you know, it\u2019s hard to distinguish sometimes what you\u2019ve dreamed and what stories you\u2019ve integrated from other people. I do begin to remember the lib -- the liberation, when the Russians came in and -- and -- and thereafter. I was very sick in the forest, and this I was told by my mother. I developed -- because I was an infant, I was what, less than two years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death, I mean, I -- s - you know, so my mother took me to a field hospital, miles away, where the Russians treated -- th-the partisans and the military had a field hospital and she wanted them to treat me and -- and the officer in charge says look at all the people, we have soldiers in there and I don\u2019t have time for -- for you. So she took me back and -- to our encampment and through some -- I forget what she told me, they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer treatment and it seemed to work, some remedy that they found, and I survived."

And some of the people, because you would -- you would have to leave -- you were in the forest. The forest was both safety, but it was also deprivation. Safety in the sense that organized armies don\u2019t go into forests. Not out of fear, but you know, it\u2019s- you -- you just don\u2019t. I mean, you don\u2019t bring in tanks and armor and what have you into forests. So you -- you -- so people can hide in a forest. On the other hand, you\u2019re deprived of food and y-you know, we weren\u2019t hunters, you know what I mean, it\u2019s not like -- yeah, I mean people ate -- you know, they ate berries or they ate mushrooms of they f -- whatever they found. But they would also go out, leave the forest and go to some peasants that they knew or some farmer, because the woods were still in the area and we wa -- we had not yet wandered far enough into it, so you were able to leave and go and get some food. But of course that presupposed that the -- th-the peasant you were going to was not going to sell you out and was not going to inform the Germans that you were there. So it was fraught with danger and of course some of the people that they knew, other Jews, were killed on these missions. So she would tell me about these things."

So -- but my own memory that I can, you know, say this, I remember this, was actually riding out of the forest on an ox drawn cart heaped with whatever belongings people had.

And the woman who was conducting the interview, and I said, well, I can give you a sh -- very short answer, or I can give you the long answer. She said no, I want the long answer. So I told her about -- a bit about my background, this. And I tried to describe the feeling of what it meant for Israel, because I was in DP camp when Israel was established. The world was very gray, very threatening, s-still -- still threatening in some ways. You felt defeated in spirit. Not just personally, but also as part of a people.

So, when Israel was established it was just the opposite. It was sunshine, it was freedom, 1t was strength. So suddenly people who are ex -- terribly weak and have been beaten by everybody are suddenly on the ascent. So that early time was definitely a period of grayness and -- and no question.

It\u2019s like if you grow up -- and I think a lot of these things are foundational, I\u2019m not saying anything profound, but it -- it\u2019s simply that if you grow up with -- with a sense of rootedness when you\u2019re young, that stays with you the rest of your life. It doesn\u2019t mean that when you\u2019re traveling to a foreign country you don\u2019t experience a certain discomfort at not knowing the language, oh -- but you -- it\u2019s different. If you have -- don\u2019t grow up with that, and if you\u2019ve missed it for the first 10 years of your life, it\u2019s very hard to replace something like that, and it means you carry it with you into all sorts of situations. It may take you a little bit longer to adjust to a particular thing, or may -- you know. But you do carry it with you and it\u2019s not that you can\u2019t- you know, we learn to articulate certain things and we become aware of them, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they -- there aren\u2019t certain predispositions that remain there. And I think that -- that happens, and I -- and I know about it, bu -- you know, and -- and -- and also attempts I made to overcome it. I -- I had a job for ORT, wonderful organization that did a lot for Jewish youngsters like me in the camps. I remember ORT and I rem -- when I wa -- came for the interview with ORT, the m-man interviewing me, who was David Dubinsky\u2019s son-in-law, Shelley Appleton, a wonderful man, and Shelley said -- asked me what I knew about ORT.

If y -- if y -- if you didn\u2019t develop it by a certain a -- it\u2019s hard to replace it and it does have -- leave an impact, cause that\u2019s what I talked about, leaving a scar.

And so my friend Gil, the one I was telling you about who lost both his parents in Auschwitz, he and I -- he had just lost his grandmother, he and I decided to go to Israel together.

My aunt, however, has dementia so I can\u2019t ask her anything and I\u2019m -- and we don\u2019t have a family so I was on the phone with my cousin Menachem\u2019s daughter, who is now 50. And of course she wants to know her history. I said, we gotta do a family tree. But now it means filling in gaps, you know. So we lost that historical thread. That\u2019s why I do appreciate the kind of work you\u2019re doing here and what, you know, what everybody does. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s fabulous."

I am interested, I mean in -- in one respect, I do want to do something about filling in the gaps in my own family history, just so -- so my kids and my grandkids will know. And it\u2019s something we all fall prey to, I have a -- a vanity book that I have downstairs that it was given to me by a man who was -- when Reagan was president [indecipherable] very wealthy man from a s -- Iraqi Jewish banking family. I mean a billionaire. And he gave me a signed copy of his book, and he said it\u2019s a history of his family. I said why\u2019d you do it? And of course he, you know, he hired somebody to write it for him. He said, because I want my children and grandchildren to know where they were coming from.

It happens to all of us, you know, so I feel I delayed, I mean, I should have started this process and -- and -- and your call was important in that, it really was."

My mother was interested in a business career for me. My grandmother, Yiddishkeit, so I combined the two of them, became a Jewish fundraiser. I said, this is like. My religion, I would say was transi -- a religious sensitivity, if you will, was transmitted by these two women, but also by the Yeshiva, and by some of the teachers I had in Yeshiva, more importantly. The -- the -- my mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s may have been tinged a bit with superstition, which also comes from that part of [indecipherable]. I -- ve always -- I\u2019ve -- one of my good buddies who is also one of my former kids, ise -- I -- in quotation marks. I just -- he\u2019s a very successful lawyer in New York whom we just had dinner with. And he and I would always argue cause his grandfather was very important to him, his -- his grandfather was from Lithuania though, so they were the midnagdin. I came from there, I said Ukraine was the birthplace of Hasidism, right? There\u2019s always a little bit of -- you know, Hasidim are emotional and the others are rational and intellectual. I got the emotional part from my mother and grandmother and if you will, the rational part from some of my rabbis. I am religious. Was I -- but I was also angry at God. And I had this discussion with my oldest and best friend Gil, cause he\u2019Il always say -- we\u2019ll have conversa -- I -- I have used reference points from Genesis and from different books of the Bible, and he\u2019ll say how come you remember this stuff? I don\u2019t remember anything. And he says -- he always said he was a non-believer. And I said to him once, because he was talking wi -- full of anger at God, I said, are you sure you don\u2019t believe? Because if you\u2019re angry at God, presupposes that you believe. So I was angry at God. No doubt about it, and still am from time to time. But that doesn\u2019t preclude the fact, quite the opposite, it affirms it. And -- and th -- th -- I had -- one privilege I had and I -- I told you I had great experience working in -- in -- and when I was working as a college -- I was really a field organizer. I took around some wonderful people. I\u2019d come back all excited at the end of the day. So one of the guys I took around was Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, I don\u2019t know if you know -- familiar with him. And I -- this is many years, it was probably his first trip to America. And they said, take him around to Jewish Day Schools or whatever. And I came back and I told Joyce, I said, [indecipherable] this blew my mind, you know? And I only dealt with bright peop -- they\u2019re all bright, you know what I mean, th -- you know. So I said, but he -- he -- I still remember what he said. He said, I would rather, when I\u2019m working with students, I'd rather work with somebody who is angry at God than somebody who is indifferent to God. Because if he says he -- if he\u2019s angry, he cares, and I can turn that around. If he\u2019s indifferent it\u2019s much tougher. So in that sense, yeah, I mean I felt myself like a lot of other Jewish people and kids especially, felt myself victimized, then abandoned and all of that. On the other hand, you know, go -- ge -- God can be the source of your anger, in a sense, or the object of your anger, but can also be a sense of your regeneration of spirit."
