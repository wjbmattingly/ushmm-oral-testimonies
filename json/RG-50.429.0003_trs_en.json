I loved sports right from the beginning but did not avoid other activities. Um there were some firm expectations from my parents to adhere to my responsibilities in school. My father had a hardware store to which I was expected to contribute by learning about the business and helping when necessary. My father was president of the hardware association of New York City and during some of those days when he had to leave early, I took over in the store and he gave me information that I, I just didn\u2019t have.

Uh it gave me a very nice feeling that when I was in Israel one year, um I um was a professor. I was a Fulbright professor at the University of Belunga in Italy. And um one little episode I will share with you which is a great joy to me. Um a welcoming uh party was scheduled by Abba Eban and Sonya Marabach head of education in Israel. Uh and I was to be the, the guest of honor. Um the taxi driver said to me well where are your flowers, this is Shabbas this is the Sabbath. Where are you where are your flowers, where is your gift. I don\u2019t have any flowers, I didn\u2019t buy any candy, I didn\u2019t buy anything. I just wanted to come. He said well usually on a Friday night, it is expected that you bring some flowers to your host. Um the taxi driver didn\u2019t know where Abba Eban lived. He knew the general neighborhood but didn\u2019t know the exact place. But he stopped some young people on the street and he said to them, I remember very clearly he said well you, you must have made some kind of relationship with these people from Israel. And I said well we did the best we could. All the florist shops were closed because it was uh between 4:30 and 5:00. They close early and I\u2019m sorry we, we had nothing to, to give. So the taxi driver uh dropped my wife and me off at the home of these officials from Israel and about 20 minutes later, the doorbell rang. And the taxi driver stepped out with a big bouquet of flowers and he handed them to my wife and he said here when you go back in there you will have a gift. You are not supposed to go in there without a gift. You should bring something to your host. And so I asked him how much it would cost and he said there would be absolutely no fee at all. It\u2019s my pleasure to be delivering you to, to have delivered you to the party and to see that as guest of honor you were well received. And so uh everyone was very excited about the fact that the taxi driver brought in some flowers because it was Friday night and uh he felt we should have known, we should have remembered but it was our first trip to Israel so I did not know. But the taxi driver made sure that all the passages were open after that."

            "answer": "It was not a Jewish community. There were uh a number of Jewish families living in our area, not many. Uh I would say that we were happy together as a group, playing sports, singing and music, being in school, um doing the kinds of things that kids do in a. in a neighborhood school. I was lucky in being the chance to go to Boys High School in Brooklyn, kind of a well known school. Um with lots of um talented people running the school and I was very delighted to be a student at Boys High School."

And um it seemed to work both ways that the non Jewish people were looking at us in that neighborhood as newcomers to that neighborhood and everything was in good shape. There was no trouble. We had no feelings whatsoever in that regard. We had normal religious training, we had normal religious output in attending services, in doing the things generally are expected of, of boys and girls age 13 and above. My father and mother saw to that. And uh it was, it was a joyous thing.  "

To understand more about the Catholic religion, the Protestant religion in the neighborhood which serves its clientele and it was our responsibility, my mother and father taught us to be together and uh it was, it was a fine, it was a fine way to do it and my father had a hardware store and in the hardware store everyone needs nails and screws, hammers, lawn mowers, it doesn\u2019t matter what religion you are, if you need a tool, you need a tool and so I learned a lot about the exchange of information, exchange of equipment tools, um how to make keys, how to fix locks, um |-o-c-k-s.

            "answer": "Uh in my younger years there was no such thing as a little league baseball or Babe Ruth league baseball. Uh fourteen managers and 26 assistant managers uh and somebody in charge of the Pepsi cola and someone in charge of, of something else. There, there wasn\u2019t that kind of uh relationship that uh the grouping was, was not hard and in that way um my parents were aware of and permitted my participation in sports so I had to balance out the hours I spent in sports with the hours I gave to sports.

            "question": "What sports did you like? how did you get started?",
            "answer": "Uh well one way in which you get started I guess is by having things close to hand. My father had a hardware store but it also had a sporting goods branch to it and so I was allowed to go pick out a pair of ice skates. I was allowed to pick out a pair of roller skates. I was allowed to pick out a brand new basketball and go with a team to a certain neighborhood to play. I was allowed to uh pick for myself and my Dad sold many of those sporting good items but it wasn\u2019t pushing me into sports in order to sell a few more gloves, a few more bats, a few more balls, not at all. And my Dad liked them very much too and that\u2019s why it was such a surprise to me when I played baseball in the Canadian American league, professional baseball on opening day when um the team I was playing with the Rome Colonels, Rome New York Colonels, um frankly uh had a, an opportunity that no one really ever gets automatically. And that was my father coming secretly and I don\u2019t mean secretly in a secret, secretive sense but in a personnel sense. He got on a train and he came up to Rome, New York, didn\u2019t let me know, stood behind the dugout watched the belgium between Ottowa and the Rome Colonels, watched his son play. After the game was over had dinner with his son, and a couple of his son\u2019s friends from the team and after dinner he got back on the train and went back to Brooklyn to his hardware store. Kind of a homey sequence but that\u2019s what he did. And uh most of..."

            "answer": "That, that started it yes. And as a handball player, tennis player, um I never had golf clubs, we never had that kind of money to fill out all the sporting goods that exist. But that was one, that was one way to do it and the competition that came from sports relationship angles uh was very important kind of experience for me. Because I, I learned to live with the competition, to lose when I had to lose without crying about it. To win when I could win with joyousness and to share with my teammates other, other kinds of experiences. The last thing I would say in this regard is that that may have been the reason why when Little League did start in Rochester, New York I started it. And got the teams together uh got the, the parents together, got it, got it started and then we went off to high school. I  4 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "question": "...how you really got into baseball, did you love it, how good were you?",
            "answer": "Well I was it was not a great competitor. I was a good competitor. I was fair. I worked hard at it. I had all the moves necessary. I was a catcher very early and being a catcher eliminates a lot of people from vying for that role. How to hold your hand, how to make sure that the fingers are in such a position that when you, when you went to the minor leagues you didn\u2019t get whacked and have your fingers broken there or in Germany. And so it was an attempt to be able to scoop the ball, learn how to scoop it without injuring your fingers and that took some doing. Um so my sports really came from high school from being a catcher at Brooklyn College from which I went to the Olympic tryouts in Baltimore. And the Olympic tryouts were held in 3 places in the United States. In Stanford, California, in western state Michigan College and in the Baltimore area and there were hundreds and hundreds of athletes vying for the spots. There were 21 places on the Olympic team, 21. And there were maybe 6, 7, 8 hundred athletes vying for that, those 21 spots and I was a catcher selected uh by the coaches for the Olympic team from Baltimore, from the east coast tryouts."

I knew what I was doing and uh wanted to be a catcher right from the beginning and catching is so hard and so difficult and uh it, it\u2019s one of the positions in sports where injuries are more likely to happen because of the close activity of the batted ball against the swinging bat and your fingers don\u2019t always give that much. Um and so I went off to school, went off to Brooklyn College, became an athlete on the Brooklyn college team, went to the Olympic tryouts, was selected for it uh and then had my chance very happily with meeting up with Hank Greenberg, the uh first baseman of the Detroit tigers who that year was being shifted from first base to outfield. Uh and I talked to him about some things that were going on that I felt needed adjustment and he gave prompt attention to what he thinks he, what he thought he could do. And he did some things that were very helpful to teammates and others on the team."

            "answer": "Never. In the first place you couldn\u2019t hope and dream for something that didn\u2019t exist, there were no Olympics in the baseball area, there just weren\u2019t any. It was track and field where Johnny Woodruff participated, sprinters, jumpers, runners, uh long distance athletes uh you can think about it. You can dream about it and you can measure yourself uh side by side with other athletes and begin to think of your own chances and you try for it and you shoot for it and by shooting for it and  5 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics really started because there was an American committee on baseball that was pushing very hard for baseball to be introduced and attached to the Olympics.  The uh number of baseball players in the world were limited pretty much to Central American teams, to all the American teams of course, South African teams uh the kinds of athletes who got started early through films, through television and began to play at a very early age.

Also the American Olympic committee wanted to see baseball in the Olympics. They had seen uh ski jumping; they had seen all the other sports and they really wanted to see baseball in there and 1t came about because the committee of the various sports, finally agreed that it would be a good thing for American baseball to be on the calendar and as far as I can tell that\u2019s when it started because I began to get mail.

Most of the baseball teams in America, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 maybe but 125,000 who ever heard of such a thing. You heard of it in Berlin, Germany for the first time and it was promoted by the small group of 28 baseball players. There were 28 of us assigned to play a series of exhibitions against each other and then go out into the countryside and demonstrate baseball to schools, to colleges, to many German institutions, how it\u2019s played uh what the difference is between baseball and soccer, uh what the rules were. How the umpires played, played the game. Um it was done um because of America and I was very proud to be a part of the group that kept pushing without pushing. We kept encouraging, encouraging, demonstrating. This is how left handed first basemen behave, this 1s how right handed pitchers do this. If you are left handed this is how it\u2019s done.

The uh number of Jewish athletes, sort of about 8 or 9 out of 328. Um the number of Jewish athletes who made the team and then quit 3 or 4 of those. Knowledge about what was going on with Hitler beginning to come more close to us. Um. One of the most telling experiences that I had personally we\u2019d lived in a small cottage. Mine happened to be named Brandenbourgh cottage. Because Hitler had charged money to all the dead residents of Brandenburg. To pay for his cottage and then they, another group paid for the, their, their named cottage. Another group paid for this and I can recall very vividly the um concern I had when I went down and I saw a big chain at the basement door of our village. There were 28 players who lived in the Brandenbourg dorf in our village and uh what I saw in the rear of the cottage was a door and another door and then a chain. And I opened the chain and I walked, started to walk downstairs in the bottom of a basement. And there was a big cavernous area. I didn\u2019t know what it was for but I sure found out. That it was for Panzer tanks, German tanks because what they did was declare the Olympic dorf, and the athlete and the military chiefs were housed where the Olympic athletes were housed after the Olympics were over and I was told by a woman who took care of that building. Raus, raus, raus, get out of there. Get out of there, get out of there. She didn\u2019t want me looking down in the basement. I didn\u2019t know what was down there but it turned out that 1t was large enough, the cellar or the basement whatever you want to call it, in my, my cottage you, you find these picture material that was brought to the studio today.

I was just say well, here\u2019s your chance to learn something and I did not speak German but I uh began to use some of the German that I knew in some of the discussions. Now the Olympic village was about 12 miles from the city of Berlin. Marty Glickman and I were headed for downtown Berlin from the village town to downtown. Um we were interested in two things, one uh a boxing match that was going to take place that day and some other events about uh kids who uh were in difficulty but uh were good athletes.

And so Marty and I were headed for downtown Berlin and we did not make it. We were late and so we went out on the highway and we put up our thumb to get a ride, dressed in the American Olympic uniform, we had no trouble being picked up. We were picked up by Germany um athletes in uniform, German army men actually, in uniform with a sidecar, a motorcycle with a sidecar and Marty and I got in the sidecar and he drove us we were almost through with the 12 miles. And I asked the question, I asked the driver of Boxinyaki Vilsen from Veronica Staaten, from North America right. Is Jackie Wilson from the United States of America going to be boxing tonight. Yako Wilson from the United States going to be boxing tonight. Huite, Heinte, I use the word Heinte, the Jewish word for tonight. Instead of Hoyte which is the German word for tonight. If I wanted to know are all of you going to the movies tonight, hoyte, are you all going tonight. So I didn\u2019t say it the right way.  (end second tape)  (Tape 3 of 3)"

            "answer": "Yes, there were opportunities to go from the Olympic village into the city of Berlin uh every 30 minutes. It was a special bus arranged for the athletes from different countries. I can recall one event when Marty Glickman a friend of mine from Syracuse University had an opportunity to go downtown together and we went on, we went out on the road ready to thumb a ride into, into the town and uh it the way it worked out was that a German jeep uh or a, or a with sidecar came by and saw our thumbs out waiting for a ride and so they stopped and they invited us in. We went in, into their vehicle and we moved along very rapidly and at one point in the ride, the German driver said to us um can I see your uh passport. Your (autograph?) And he said to me can I see your autograph also in German. And uh we had them with us but we didn\u2019t think it was their right to have them and so I went beyond that and I said um, uh tell me did will Yaquie Wilson from Veronichastaten from North America be boxen heint, I was really speaking Yiddish, the word heint meaning tonight and instead of saying hoyte which is tonight in German, I said heinte and so that aroused their concern somewhat and um they asked us to stay over on the side of the highway. They talked to us a little bit, much of which we couldn\u2019t understand but they asked for our autographs in spite of the fact that they were saying to themselves, these are two Jewish athletes. We were dressed in uniforms so they knew what, what we were doing there. Uh the uh opportunity for knowledge of other country would be helpful to them so they asked us for our autographs but being stopped on the road, driving along with him and then being stopped to be asked uh what, what your autograph, what your number was and then linking that to uh, a request for an autograph was unusual, that did happen yes.
