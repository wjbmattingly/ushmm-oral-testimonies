There are many different apples, you know. And so -- actually not. [indecipherable] this one you just [indecipherable] and that\u2019s it, yeah, yeah. No, it\u2019s a -- no, it\u2019s the -- you know, in the -- when I was retired, came this thing with the Belgium, you know, amnesty here and say you can get the [indecipherable] you can think this because then union from the job. And -- and then came this bulletin from the Diaspora, you know, you see. This is a bulletin which is written by a group of progressive Jews in -- in Belgium, were -- who are trying to -- to have the Belgium state recognized, their capability during the war, which has not done, contrary let\u2019s say to -- to France. And who introduced through politicians, some legislation on that, but until now, even under social democrat government they don\u2019t move. They have ceremonies, etcetera in Malines, or in other places where there is Jewish past history, but they don\u2019t recognize the culpability of the state, saying that most of the arrest, 108 Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007 etcetera were done by Belgium policemen and gendarmes. You know, they -- the German were not to be seen too much, but for the Jewish case was this guy named [indecipherable] and many collaborators, you know? The German was using them until a certain point, you know, when, in \u201943 they were losing the war, and then they -- they had to -- to compli -- dominate every sector of the population and against the resistance, which was so and so, so and so because after the war, practically everybody was a resister. And -- and things like that. Then -- then that was the -- the case, and it\u2019s only now that they came with this, they ca -- like they came to me with these veteran question. I never ask anything, you know, they say you -- you are Korean veteran, you are a-allowed to get this 500 euro, 700 dollar for this, and [indecipherable] for that. And then they came with the restituti -- [indecipherable] then this group, who was [indecipherable] try also to fight anti-Semitism in Belgium, which you know 1s rising like many place in Europe. Not through violent acts, but through, you know, speeches by the extremist right and things like that. And also they are attacking the -- the -- the Belgium government to av -- agree that all the funds from the restitution be divided between the survivors or the son of the survivors, and -- and given to the creation of a Jewish foundation of things like that. And I became interest because I -- I think, learning what happened here with the claims, with Eisennstadt and with Eggenberger, th-that it\u2019s not acceptable. That the priorities should not be there hundred and hundred of thousand of salaries that they get. Ah, but we were -- we -- the 109 Interview with David Brombart May 7, 2007- th-the survivor, and I s -- I ready to say I don\u2019t need it, but there are some people who need it, okay? And -- and -- and then this 1s quite important. Then bu -- they also - other news about this Belgian archive. Then I wrote to the guy, he was a -- he was Jewish, [indecipherable] and -- who send me all those photo and reports and things like that, which I think is -- 1s quite important because there were so many, and answer indirectly your question, I was not brief on when they came, what was their history. You know, anyone 1s that, and what\u2019s -- what happened exactly with my brother, my father-in-law, with my mother\u2019s resistance to all that, I -- wha -- wha -- what 1s the truth was not the truth, you know, in this thing. Then it was very important. And this led me to -- to ask about this interview. You see, this is the chronology of the thing. And Arnheim said yes, it\u2019s very important that there 1s a second step, that all documentation is in fact, used, 1n a way that you have nothing extraordinary to tell, a- and I -- I know that. It\u2019s just one experience, okay, and it\u2019s not the same experience that the -- th-the -- my father was really hidden in the house, couldn't go out , okay? There were some children also in the same situation. And children were denounced by people and send into camp. O-Or my friends sent in a convent or a monastery.
