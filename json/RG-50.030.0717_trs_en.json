I met the contractor representatives early on, established a good relationship with them, and it was apparent from day one there was going to be a major labor problem, and the problem was that a uni on shop contractor was hired to build the biggest project that had ever happened in the state of Tennessee in a nonunion area, and they were going to have to negotiate some way that these nonunion people could work at this on this construction job. And the head of the the owner of the engineering and building company that built it, the company that had headquarters in New York and Cleveland, was a very farsighted individual, and he knew that this was going to be a major story because it was the first time in the war construction program that this situation had been encountered, and this was goi ng to be the paradigm of projects of that kind, and he asked me if I could get a le ave of absence from the paper to help him through this crisis they were going to have, and he asked me how (Interruption in proceedings.)"

One was that I came into the Army late, so I knew that I was going to be there for about a year after the war was over, so and the people who had been at AFN were leaving because they had a number of points to go home. And the Army did a great job of demobilizing the troops, and you knew almost at the end of World War II in Europe when you were going home, and you could figure it within a week almost, and so I knew it was going to be in May of '46 that I was going to come home, and I ta lked to my commanding officer about it, and he was an old AP guy, and he got me appointments at Stars and Stripes, Yank, and AFN, and AFN offered me a job, so I moved from Germany down to Paris and stayed there four or five months."

You know, we knew they did these things. The the other point that about the trial itself and the fairness of it, the Germans convicted themselves because of their documentation. And I'll give you an example of that. When Goering was being questioned by MaxwellFife, MaxwellFife said, \"What is the first duty of a prisoner of war?\" And Goering said, \"To escape.\" And the Luftwaffe, Goering had had responsibility for running the prison camps for a ll captured Air Force people. They didn't go into the general Army pool of prisoners of war. They were in they called them Luft stalags. And Goering said, \"To escape.\" And he said pulled out a document, and he said, \"Do you know have you ev er visited this Luft Stalag,\" whatever the name of it was, and Goering said he was there once or twice. And he said, \"Have you ever heard the names,\" and he read four Eng lish pilots; and Goering said, \"No, I never heard of them.\" He said, \"Well, were you aware that they tried to escape and were captured and brought back?\" And Goering said, \"I don't know anything about that.\" And he said then they like three months later escaped again, and they were brought back, and he said, \"Would it surprise you if I told you that they were executed?\" And Goering said and he said, \"What would you have done if you knew that?\" And he said , \"I would have reprimanded those who were responsible for doing it.\" And he pulls out this letter, and it is asking for permission to execute them, and Goering not onl y says \"okay,\" or th e equivalent, but he says, \"This will show the others what will happen to them if they try to escape.\""

And one of the questions that we asked Jackson was, \"Why do you say that they are being given a fair trial?\" And he went into great detail and says, you know, \"We let them choose their own lawyers, and so if they wanted a Nazi for a lawyer, we approved that. We paid the lawyers. We gave them a place to work and fitted it out for them. We gave them copies of all the documents before we introduced them.\" You know, they did whatever they possibly could. And, also, the the judge Ju dge they could object, and a lot of times the objections were sustained. So I think it came as close as you could get to, you know, AngloSaxon type justice. And the other thing about it that I think speaks in favor of what of a fair trial is there was a good deal of variation in the sentences. You know, there was 11, I think, of the 20"
