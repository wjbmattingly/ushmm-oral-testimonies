            "answer": "You know, everything that goes on on a college campus. There would be lecturers who would come on the campus, and I would write a story that said that so and so was going to come and speak on such and such a date, and then that would be three or four weeks or three or four months before he came. And then the day before, I would say do another little story and say he was going to be here tomorrow, and then I would do a story on what he said. So I sort of worked out the system, and most of that stuff got published, but the I guess the outstanding accomplishment was I did an interview of Faulkner, and when Faulkner returned from Hollywood back to Oxford, I had the first interview with him, and it was I was asked to do a rewrite for the AP and also for the book section of the New York Herald Tribune."

And he was writing when I got there, and he did all of his writing in a woodshed that had no heat in it, and he came back into the house and sort of rubbing his hands, and he he was he seemed to me, he came across at the beginning as very shy, you know, like a deer in the headlights, and seemed ill at ease, but after maybe three or four minutes he loosened up and I think one of the problems was with the interview, as I go back and look read it from time to time, I really didn't know enough about what he had done as a writer. I had not I had read one of his books, so it is it is not a really penetrating interview, but it it did get a lot of attention, and and the biggest news out of it was that he told me that he was going to do this trilogy on Yoknapatawpha County."

I had been at school for twoandahalf years, I was in the middle of my junior year, and by that time I was regarded as probably the best news person on the campus. At that time it was a very small school, it had 1600 students, and and IJ had this unique situation where I knew the chancellor extremely well and he knew me, and the news bureau office 1s a place where they had correspondents from the Jackson newspapers, New Orleans Times/Picayune Herald correspondent, and that was our place where they assigned us space. And, also, there was an FDR new deal program called the National Youth Administration, which was intended to get money into the hands of college students, and so they they had about five job allocations, and these people went around the campus and gathered news, and they would put out what we called \"hometowners.\" Suzy Brown got elected president of a sorority, and they would write that paragraph, and then another paragraph about what a great university the University of Mississippi was, and they would send them out, and the local papers in Mississippi would run them."

And I had this crazy notion that someone was going to discover me and take me to New York, and it happened six months later. And the circumstances of it were that Congress had passed a selective service bill in August of 1940, and that set off a very large construction program, particularly so in the south/southwest, and I got the story that the war department was going to build a large shellloading plant, ammunition plant, about 85 miles from Memphis. I met the contractor representatives early on, established a good relationship with them, and it was apparent from day one there was going to be a major labor problem, and the problem was that a union shop contractor was hired to build the biggest project that had ever happened in the state of Tennessee in a nonunion area, and they were going to have to negotiate some way that these nonunion people could work at this on this construction job. And the head of the the owner of the engineering and building company that built it, the company that had headquarters in New York and Cleveland, was a very farsighted individual, and he knew that this was going to be a major story because it was the first time in the war construction program that this situation had been encountered, and this was going to be the paradigm of projects of that kind, and he asked me if I could get a leave of absence from the paper to help him through this crisis they were going to have, and he asked me how (Interruption in proceedings.)"

And after I did go he asked me a question, he said, \"How much do they pay you?\" And I said, \"$25 a week.\" And he said, \"Well, we will double that.\" And he said, \"Do you have a car?\" And I said, \"No, sir.\" And he said, \"Well, we will get you a car.\" And I knew that at some point I was going to get drafted, and also I knew in the back of my mind this guy's offices were in New York, and if I played this right, I might be able to get myself jumped up to New York. And so the labor problem was settled in five or six weeks, and I was not doing anything, and his people knew senior people knew that I was sort of anxious and itchy, and they told him, and he called me and said, \"Sit tight until I come down.\" And he came down, and he said, \"We would like for you to be a permanent part of our company.\" And he was farsighted enough to know that the construction engineering field was going to have a lot of new competition because the war was going to make small companies big companies, and he said, \"We are going to have to pay more attention to public relations, marketing,\" so forth and so on, and he said, \"Our people think that you might be good for that job,\" and"

Of course, back then it didn't cost very much to take somebody to lunch or to dinner, and I would have a lunch date every day with some reporter or editor, and dinner with them, and so that continued until late 1943.

There were four radio networks back then, and our Sunday night lineup would have Jack Benny, Jimmy Durante, Bob Hope; whereas, the other networks back 1n the States, they had one of them on each.

One was that I came into the Army late, so I knew that I was going to be there for about a year after the war was over, so and the people who had been at AFN were leaving because they had a number of points to go home. And the Army did a great job of demobilizing the troops, and you knew almost at the end of World War II in Europe when you were going home, and you could figure it within a week almost, and so I knew it was going to be in May of '46 that I was going to come home, and I talked to my commanding officer about it, and he was an old AP guy, and he got me appointments at Stars and Stripes, Yank, and AFN, and AFN offered me a job, so I moved from Germany down to Paris and stayed there four or five months."

You know, we knew they did these things. The the other point that about the trial itself and the fairness of it, the Germans convicted themselves because of their documentation. And I'll give you an example of that. When Goering was being questioned by MaxwellFife, MaxwellFife said, \"What is the first duty of a prisoner of war?\" And Goering said, \"To escape.\" And the Luftwaffe, Goering had had responsibility for running the prison camps for all captured Air Force people. They didn't go into the general Army pool of prisoners of war. They were in they called them Luft stalags. And Goering said, \"To escape.\" And he said pulled out a document, and he said, \"Do you know have you ever visited this Luft Stalag,\" whatever the name of it was, and Goering said he was there once or twice. And he said, \"Have you ever heard the names,\" and he read four English pilots; and Goering said, \"No, I never heard of them.\" He said, \"Well, were you aware that they tried to escape and were captured and brought back?\" And Goering said, \"I don't know anything about that.\" And he said then they like three months later escaped again, and they were brought back, and he said, \"Would it surprise you if I told you that they were executed?\" And Goering said and he said, \"What would you have done if you knew that?\" And he said, \"I would have reprimanded those who were responsible for doing it.\" And he pulls out this letter, and it is asking for permission to execute them, and Goering not only says \"okay,\" or the equivalent, but he says, \"This will show the others what will happen to them if they try to escape.\""

And one of the questions that we asked Jackson was, \"Why do you say that they are being given a fair trial?\" And he went into great detail and says, you know, \"We let them choose their own lawyers, and so if they wanted a Nazi for a lawyer, we approved that. We paid the lawyers. We gave them a place to work and fitted it out for them. We gave them copies of all the documents before we introduced them.\" You know, they did whatever they possibly could. And, also, the the judge Judge they could object, and a lot of times the objections were sustained. So I think it came as close as you could get to, you know, AngloSaxon type justice. And the other thing about it that I think speaks in favor of what of a fair trial is there was a good deal of variation in the sentences. You know, there was 11, I think, of the 20"
