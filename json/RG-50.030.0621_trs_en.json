And Fanny, first of all, I \u2014 like I do on every interview, I would like to thank you for giving our \u2014 your time today to speak with us. But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask \u2014 and I will be asking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they born, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on. All of these things are very important. But Id like to start ours in a little different way, because before we started the \u2014 the interview itself, we were talking about the process of it, and you were ac \u2014 you were telling me about some of the reservations that you had. So I\u2019d like to talk about that a little bit, about what 1s it like to speak with someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today. If you could share some of those thoughts with me.",
            "answer": "For me it\u2019s very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons. I have heard many wonderful speakers here at the museum, but all those people have been single people when the war started. I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities. Interview with Fanny Aizenberg , April 21, 2011 And we \u2014 it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many years, I\u2019m still living with the horrors I lived through in Auschwitz."

Even today, which is so many years later, when I\u2019m in a car, and I pass where there\u2019s a railroad, I still break out in a sweat, which 1s not the polit \u2014 polite way of saying. Because we had been for so long in the cattle train and I don\u2019t think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was for three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a cattle train. The prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I cannot find the words fer \u2014 to describe such unhuman things."

Anyway, I was very, very fortunate, I met Steven, and immediately we connected very nicely. At the same time, I was translating a book from Belgium, who just came out. This was a no \u2014 official book, how many transports they had from [indecipherable] how many people in each transport, how many people made into camp.

S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which 1s survivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience. So, to fill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that\u2019s otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the museum, or calling us or writing me for that information. That\u2019s one particular database and since then we also work with many other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases, digitized and also scanned image databases. "

And so Fanny came to me as a volunteer from \u2014 she had mentioned our volunteer coordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several \u2014 working with computers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry. And we often get Interview with Fanny Aizenberg \u201d April 21, 2011 requests not only for individual information, but information based on place. So for instance, all the people who were from \u2014 in Theresienstadt for instance, concentration camp, or from a particular town, or share a ca \u2014 particular experience, and with our database, we\u2019re able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a list of individuals, but individuals from a particular place.

And Fanny was able to help me to \u2014I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I could filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual. That was one database. The other infor \u2014 information \u2014 the other job she had was, since Fanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that\u2019s a list of the deportations that took place in Belgium.

This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something much more happened between you. And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f \u2014 that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years?",
            "answer": "Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my story. And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening. Also, when we got the book from Belgium, further descriptions, the number of trains, the number of people in the trains and how many transport, at the same time the museum got a book called \u201cThe Hidden Heroes.\u201d That book was written by a German reporter. She is from Germany. She tried to interview peop \u2014 Jewish people in Germany and nobody wanted to give her any information. Somehow, she was so determined, she came to Belgium and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg \" April 21, 2011 underground. The underground, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity, and they have pictures right here from that. So that book, and the one I was translating made more sense because you could put the two and two together. And that book wasn\u2019t selling too well, and they had \u2014 she had to change the title, to \u201cThe 20 Transport.\u201d And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what made in Belgium more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people, non-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group. Where in France they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in Holland. And this is why in Belgium only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can\u2019t even find the names, who organized in convents, in churches and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in Belgium, including my own child."

So Steven would \u2014 made sure I have a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted Interview with Fanny Aizenberg \" April 21, 2011 to know. Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the second floor, you just seen people running back and forth, specially young students. So we really \u2014 my job really was, can we help you? And we did, because once we had a French person who was sent from a newspaper in France, with the picture from the room where you have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he wanted. And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you? Then he said in French, nobody knows the answer.

                " Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as they\u2019ve gone by, what you\u2019ve learned from Fanny and through the relationship that developed between you about her story? S: Oh my God. Well, the first thing I wanted to say 1s I br \u2014 I wanted to push Fanny, because we did develop this personal relationship and I\u2019m very fortunate in my job that I\u2019m able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet hundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os \u2014 really special. And again, one of my profe \u2014 jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals are remembered. And so, while we had great conversations, I didn\u2019t want it to end there. I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through oral histories, read her story. I always get her \u2014 want her to write out her stories, do presentations as much as possible. And so in this way, it\u2019s sort of my job, but to make sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible. She has so many things to teach about \u2014 I guess mainly for me 1s overcoming. Someone who\u2019s been through so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what she went through. And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that. You go through so many things and sometimes there\u2019s no answer to them, you just have to wait things out until they pass. And you\u2019re affected for life, but that horrible moment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards. And Fanny was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg : April 21, 2011 able to do that. So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter. And so I see that for the horrible things that Fanny went through, four generations later, there\u2019s a beautiful 12 year old girl that\u2019s a friend of my son\u2019s actually. And I see that if it wasn\u2019t for Fanny just persevering and going on, that\u2019s \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl would not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the freedom to go to school and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn\u2019t able to later on in her life.

You think at \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 I thought, I don\u2019t know others, that this is gonna be my last moment and I have to hang onto it to see my last moment going out of me. You see, this 1s why it\u2019s so difficult for me to stand up and to speak, because everybody had different experiences. But here at the museum, of having so many survivor volunteers, I\u2019m the only one who had the medical experimentation. And this is why maybe it took me so many years to be talking about. And like I told you, took me 50 years after I came back from Auschwitz from \u2014 liberated from the Russians. I was in the hospital a few times in Belgium. Don\u2019t forget we didn\u2019t have our period a month after we got to Auschwitz, and with the experimentation it took me 50 years to be able to talk about that period. But you know while they did those experimentation, it was like little by little your life gets less, and you think you there already. Then you feel another pain, and it\u2019s not there yet, you still have to go lower."

And another thing which has been 104 Interview with Fanny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 found out, more and more studies are being done on us, that children of survivors either went into education, or went into medicine. And I tell you why I\u2019m mentioning that to you. I think it\u2019s very important, because now here in America, you hear so much violence, you hear so many young people killing one another. Either students, or just in the street the gangs. So when they arrest a young person, 14 - 15, who has been killing, the judge or whoever defends those people, feel because they didn\u2019t have a very good upbringing, that\u2019s what made them violent. What about babies born and never know the parents, like you see the program a couple weeks ago, we were still looking for the pictures of children who have never been able to connect to any family, because they were in hiding, or the parents didn\u2019t come back, or any family come back to claim them. But all those children who have been in hiding, they definitely didn\u2019t have a good upbringing. And then in spite of that they all in education, or in medicine.
