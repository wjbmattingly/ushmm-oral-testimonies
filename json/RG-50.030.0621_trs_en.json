And Fanny, first of all, I \u2014 like I do on every interview, I would like to thank you for giving our \u2014 your time today to speak with us. But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask \u2014 and I will be asking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they born, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on. All of these things are very important. But Id like to start ours in a little different way, because before we started the \u2014 the interview itself, we were talking about the process of it, and you were ac \u2014 you were telling me about some of the reservations that you had. So I\u2019d like to talk about that a little bit, about what 1s it like to speak with someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today. If you could share some of those thoughts with me.",
            "answer": "For me it\u2019s very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons. I have heard many wonderful speakers here at the museum, but all those people have been single people when the war started. I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities.

Even today, which is so many years later, when I\u2019m in a car, and I pass where there\u2019s a railroad, I still break out in a sweat, which 1s not the polit \u2014 polite way of saying. Because we had been for so long in the cattle train and I don\u2019t think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was for three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a cattle train. The prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I cannot find the words fer \u2014 to describe such unhuman things."

S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which 1s survivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience. So, to fill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that\u2019s otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the museum, or calling us or writing me for that information.

Where in France they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in Holland. And this is why in Belgium only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can\u2019t even find the names, who organized in convents, in churches and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in Belgium, including my own child."

                " Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as they\u2019ve gone by, what you\u2019ve learned from Fanny and through the relationship that developed between you about her story? S: Oh my God. Well, the first thing I wanted to say 1s I br \u2014 I wanted to push Fanny, because we did develop this personal relationship and I\u2019m very fortunate in my job that I\u2019m able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet hundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os \u2014 really special. And again, one of my profe \u2014 jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals are remembered. And so, while we had great conversations, I didn\u2019t want it to end there. I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through oral histories, read her story. I always get her \u2014 want her to write out her stories, do presentations as much as possible. And so in this way, it\u2019s sort of my job, but to make sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible. She has so many things to teach about \u2014 I guess mainly for me 1s overcoming. Someone who\u2019s been through so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what she went through. And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that. You go through so many things and sometimes there\u2019s no answer to them, you just have to wait things out until they pass. And you\u2019re affected for life, but that horrible moment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards. And Fanny was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Fanny Aizenberg : April 21, 2011 able to do that. So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter. And so I see that for the horrible things that Fanny went through, four generations later, there\u2019s a beautiful 12 year old girl that\u2019s a friend of my son\u2019s actually. And I see that if it wasn\u2019t for Fanny just persevering and going on, that\u2019s \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl would not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the freedom to go to school and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn\u2019t able to later on in her life.

Hundreds of years ago, if a family in Germany had a child and they felt that that child is not perfect, they used to have an institution where they gave their child away. When that child, or adult for that matter, died, the family just got a notice, your so and so passed away, and that was it. Nobody has ever questioned it, because everybody had to be perfect in Germany, and if the \u2014 they were not, they were taken to those institutions. And that\u2019s why, when they had the seminar here, they came to the museum, because of the background they have already learned, what the Germans did, hundreds \u2014 sterilization.

But they were ahead of me, because they are the ones who taught me what has happened 200 years ago. So this now is just \u2014 like they have one book which is called \u201cThe Nazi Doctors.\u201d People want to know, why was it possible, for educated people? It\u2019s not like today a bunch of hoodlums want your money and they kill you just for the money. This was organized by excellent physicians, nurses, educated people. How could they have done the horrors they did? I tell you another thing what happened Auschwitz and what the Germans did. They had part of the camp where they had Gypsies collected from Europe. What they have decided and what they have done, there were women, were children and men. They decide that the men should lined up for the following day and that they\u2019re gonna be taken to work. Meanwhile, they have given milk to the children of the women who they took the fathers away. A few days later they took the women and the children. That was in August of 1944. And they gassed the women the following two days. In order not to fa \u2014 have a \u2014 a disturbing, they gave the babies the milk. Can you imagine how vicious that is, and being done by educated doctors who were supposed to help people?"

There\u2019s another book here, the author of the book passed away a couple years ago. There\u2019s only two people, two young men from Czechoslovakia who escaped Auschwitz. They describe Auschwitz, how the selections was, and they passed \u2014 the main reason for the young men to escape and how they escape, and those were the two only ones who ever escape alive, is because they wanted to go to Czechoslovakia, where they come from, to go to different organizations, because Eichmann was getting everything from the Jewish community in Hungary. Trucks, tools, just name it, because he was fooling the Jewish people, telling them whatever you give us, then we would not have the discrimination or the deportation of the Jewish [indecipherable]. But it didn\u2019t happen so, because in spite of everything he took, it was continuing. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really an amazing book if you could sit through and just read it. You have to have a lot of strength, or whatever you have in you. Because I was asked by one of the physicians who were here at the seminar, asking me how far I was in reading the book. And I said so far I\u2019m on the second page, and I wasn\u2019t able to turn for the third. But I have learned from them, which they have studied and they would, you know, like see how this 1s continuing with the German people.

And I tell you why I\u2019m mentioning that to you. I think it\u2019s very important, because now here in America, you hear so much violence, you hear so many young people killing one another. Either students, or just in the street the gangs. So when they arrest a young person, 14 - 15, who has been killing, the judge or whoever defends those people, feel because they didn\u2019t have a very good upbringing, that\u2019s what made them violent. What about babies born and never know the parents, like you see the program a couple weeks ago, we were still looking for the pictures of children who have never been able to connect to any family, because they were in hiding, or the parents didn\u2019t come back, or any family come back to claim them. But all those children who have been in hiding, they definitely didn\u2019t have a good upbringing. And then in spite of that they all in education, or in medicine.

But I don\u2019t know if I told you before, Primo Levi was a scientist. After the war when he was liberated, he went back to Italy where he was from. He got his position back, which was very high position. He got married, he had a son, and he committed suicide, because he could not accept the outside world. According to many statistic, there\u2019s about 42 people who have survived Auschwitz and killed themself. I mean prominent people. When I say prominent, is people who got positions back after the war. They were recognized as people and they could not accept the outside world, after having seen what has been done to people. And I don\u2019t think that any of us, if 1t wouldn\u2019t be for the seminar, happened here in the Holocaust museum, I did not know that the Germans did medical experimentation on babies.
