And Fanny , first of all, I \u0152 like I do on every interview, I would like to thank you for giving our \u0152 your time today to speak with us. But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask \u0152 and I will be asking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they born, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on. All of these things are very important. But I\u2122d like to start ours in a little different way, because before we started the \u0152 the interview itself, we were talking about the process of it, and you were ac \u0152 you were telling me about some of the reservations that you had. So I\u2122d like to talk about that a little bit, about what is it like to speak with someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today. If you could share some of those thoughts with me.",
            "answer": "For me it\u2122s very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons. I have heard many wonderful speakers here at the museum, but all those people have been single people when the war started. I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities. Interview with Fa nny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 4And we \u0152 it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many years, I\u2122m still living with the horrors I lived through in Auschwitz."

Even today, which is so many years later, when I\u2122m in a car, and I pass where there\u2122s a railroad, I still break out in a sweat, which is not the polit \u0152 polite way of saying. Because we had been for so long in the cattle train and I don\u2122t think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was for three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a cattle train. The prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I cannot find the words fer \u0152 to describe such unhuman things."

S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which is survivors or their families providing that in formation to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have do cumentation of that experience. So, to fill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that\u2122s otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the museum, or calling us or writing me for that information. That\u2122s one particular database and since then we also work with many other databases, including oral hist ory collections, more online databases, digitized and also scanned image databases. "

And so Fanny came to me as a volunteer from \u0152 she had mentioned our volunteer coordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several \u0152 working with computers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry. And we often get Interview with Fa nny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 9requests not only for individual information, but information based on place. So for instance, all the people who were from \u0152 in Theresienstadt for instance, concentration camp, or from a particular to wn, or share a ca \u0152 particular experience, and with our database, we\u2122re able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a list of individuals, but individuals from a particular place.

The other infor \u0152 informa tion \u0152 the other job she had was, since Fanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that\u2122s a list of the deportations that took place in Belgium.

This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something much more happened between you. And Fanny , can you tell me what it is that you f \u0152 that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years?",
            "answer": "Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my story. And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening. Also, wh en we got the book from Belgium, further descriptions, the number of trains, the number of people in the trains and how many transport, at the same time the museum got a book called \ufb01The Hidden Heroes.\ufb02 That book was written by a German reporter. She is from Germany. She tried to interview peop \u0152 Jewish people in Germany and nobody wanted to give her any information. Somehow, she was so determined, she came to Belgium and she got the real information, w ith the names of the people from the Interview with Fa nny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 11underground. The underground, the resistan ce, they were also called the solidarity, and they have pictures ri ght here from that. So that book, and the one I was translating made more sense because you could put the two and two together. And that book wasn\u2122t selling too well, and they had \u0152 she had to change the title, to \ufb01The 20th Transport.\ufb02 And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what made in Belgium more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people, non-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group. Where in France they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in Holland. And this is why in Belgium only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can\u2122t even find the names, who organized in convents, in churches and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40 ,000 Jewish people have survived in Belgium, including my own child."

Another thing what we did is an ybody passing by on the second floor, you just seen people running back and forth, sp ecially young students. So we really \u0152 my job really was, can we help you? And we did, because once we had a French person who was sent from a newspaper in France, with the picture from the room where you have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he wanted. And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you? Then he said in French, nobody knows the answer. And he had a copy of the picture and the name of the newspaper he was repr esenting. So immediately if not sooner, Steven was able, through the computer, to get the \u0152 all the information, which he typed for him to take.

                " Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as they\u2122ve gone by, what you\u2122ve learned from Fanny and through the relationship that developed between yo u about her story? S: Oh my God. Well, the first thing I wanted to say is I br \u0152 I wanted to push Fanny , because we did develop this personal relationship and I\u2122m very fortunate in my job that I\u2122m able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet hundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os \u0152 really special. And again, one of my profe \u0152 jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals are remembered. And so, while we had great conversations, I didn\u2122t want it to end there. I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through oral histories, read her story. I always get her \u0152 want her to write out her stories, do presentations as much as possible. And so in this way, it\u2122s sort of my job, but to make sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible. She has so many things to teach about \u0152 I guess mainly for me is overcoming. Someone who\u2122s been through so much, and by listening to her I un derstand as much as anybody can, what she went through. And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that. You go through so many things and sometim es there\u2122s no answer to them, you just have to wait things out until they pass. And you\u2122re affected for life, but that horrible moment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards. And Fanny was Interview with Fa nny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 15able to do that. So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter. And so I see that for the horrible things that Fanny went through, four generations la ter, there\u2122s a beautiful 12 year old girl that\u2122s a friend of my son\u2122s ac tually. And I see that if it wasn\u2122t for Fanny just persevering and going on, that\u2122s \u0152 if it wasn\u2122t for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl would not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the freedom to go to school and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn\u2122t able to later on in her life.

And another thing which has been Interview with Fa nny Aizenberg April 21, 2011 104found out, more and more studies are being done on us, that children of survivors either went into education, or went into medicine. And I tell you why I\u2122m mentioning that to you. I think it\u2122s very important, because now here in America, you hear so much violence, you hear so many young people killing one another. Either students, or just in the street the gangs. So when they arrest a young person, 14 - 15, who has been killing, the judge or whoever defends those people, feel because they didn\u2122t have a very good upbringing, that\u2122s what made them violent. What about babies born and never know the parents, like you see the program a couple weeks ago, we were still looking for the pictures of children who have never been able to connect to any family, because they were in hiding, or the parents didn\u2122t come back, or any family come back to claim them. But all those children who have been in hiding, they definitely didn\u2122t have a good upbr inging. And then in spite of that they all in education, or in medicine. Like my daughter, who is in education, and my granddaughter is a medical si \u0152 psychiatrist."
