So I went to [indecipherable] in San Raphael in the \u2014 in the \u2014 I forgot the name of the \u2014 of the camp in San Raphael. You \u2014 you remember the name? A2: Villa Marianne. ",
                " Yeah, Villa Marianna(ph). And up there was a nice villa, where every day we used to go to the beach to swim. But we had no food, it was hu \u2014 we were hungry. And at the beach, we used to wait for \u2014 French couples used to come on the beach, and they used to have melon. And when they li \u2014 left the place where they stayed, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Andre Zalc \" July 23, 2009 the blanket and everything, they left the melon, you know, cut, the melon. And when they cut the melon, they just cut the top, and there was like melon left. So we used to take that and eat that. That was \u2014 that was a \u2014 a big thing to us to grab the melon from the people when they le \u2014 when they left. And in San Raphael, we \u2014 we used to go to school, we had to march to school, maybe about four miles every day to school. We had to march in \u2014 in steps. If you didn\u2019t march in steps, the \u2014 the cadres(ph) who used to wa-watch you, they used to hit you, you know? One day I had the fight with one of the cadres(ph).

And in school there was the kids who came from the farms, and they had big sandwiches. So we used to give them marbles sometime and they used to give us a sandwich, because they were not hungry, the kids from the farms. So I used to have a kid who used to give me his sandwich. And I used to give him marbles, different things, bells. And then finally one day he came to school, he wouldn\u2019t give us his sandwich. Cause the sandwich, I used to split it with my other buddies from the \u2014 from the \u2014 from the Villa Marianna(ph). So \u2014 so he [indecipherable] I say, why didn \u2014 why didn\u2019t you give us sandwich? He said, my Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 mother says I shouldn\u2019t give to m \u2014 the sandwich to strange kids, because you people are not French, she say, you know, like he was a little racist. So \u2014 so, when he threw away the sandwich, I got him, and it was like a big barrel in the yard, and I \u2014 I pushed his head in the barrel, you know, in order to get the sandwich. So he told his mother that I roughed him up, because we took the sandwich from him. So the mother came to school. In those days there was no gasoline, they had horses, and the mother had a nice carriage with a horse like a racing horse, and she had a whip, an umbrella, and she had her \u2014 her father on the carriage too. But the father was senile, he was very old. He was on the horse too. And she went to the principal, and sh-she argued with the principal that we beat him up, the kids from the Villa Marianna(ph) beat him up. So I had to go to see the principal. So the \u2014 the principal said to me, what\u2019s the matter? How come you hit him beca \u2014 and took his sandwich? So I said no, he gave us his sandwich, then he didn\u2019t want to give us his sandwich no more. So we \u2014 we were hungry, so we took the san \u2014 so the principal explained to the mother that the kids 1n \u2014 in the \u2014 in the home, they don\u2019t have too much food, so they dependent on that sandwich. And he \u2014 he gave a \u2014 he gave them the sandwich and then he stopped giving us the sandwich. So the principal made before that, all that stuff happened, he made conversation with me, and he was in the second World War in Belgium as a soldier, a French soldier. And he was very Interview with Andre Zalc \u201c July 23, 2009 friendly with me because h-he knew Belgium. So he explained to the mother that she gotta speak to the son, it\u2019s not \u2014 they\u2019re not malicious kids, they\u2019re like hungry, you know? So the mother changed \u2014 changed, and she told the kid to give us a sandwich. So, since that time, we used to get a sandwich from the kid. It was a big, big country bread. Th-The French used to make bread, round bread like that, like the Italian country bread, y\u2019*know? And the m \u2014 he used to give us a sandwich, and ri \u2014 1n the beginning we didn\u2019t want to take a sandwich, we didn\u2019t want no trouble with him. He said, no, no, no, the principal knows about it, you can take the sandwich and have your sandwich. My mother said I should give you the sandwich. So there was a\u2014a success there with the sandwich, you know, in that school. And then a \u2014 and then a \u2014 at \u2014 I stayed there maybe another month, and then I went back to Tresse, to my \u2014 to my father and my mother. And \u2014 and I used to \u2014 I used to go see my father in the mountains, you know, where he used to cut the woods? And that became like the \u2014 the resistance. It became like a stronghold of the resistance. And then one day \u2014 my mother used to give me food to bring to my father, you know, like food that she made that he liked. And I w \u2014I was on the way to leave town to go to the mountains, a German patrol were in town, German troops. And the patrol, they went with me for awhile, you know, and they ask me where I\u2019m going. I said to, you know, my grandmother, I\u2019m going to see my grandmother. So, Interview with Andre Zalc \u201c July 23, 2009 th-they walked a little bit with me. Maybe somebody squealed that I\u2019m going to see my father. So \u2014 so the \u2014 the German patrol, the German officer heard like noise in the bushes, because there was a lot of lizards there and even snakes. So he says in German, I understood what he said, he says [speaks German here]. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go back. Let\u2019s not go with them, because it\u2019s dangerous areas, like a jungle, he said. [speaks German] It means it\u2019s like a jungle. So he \u2014 th-the German patrol stayed in town, they ac \u2014 they walked a little bit with me, maybe 200 meters, and then they went back. So I went by myself up to the mountain. It was a big climb, was like maybe four or five hours until I got up there. And at that time, they derailed a German train. And when they derailed the German train, there were sardines, they captured a lot of sardines and weapons. There was trains going to Italy that they derailed. And there were \u2014 there were \u2014 the train had sardines and sweet milk, because the German women who used to go to Italy to meet their husbands, who were in the German army, used to have sweet milk for their babies. And when they derailed the train, the French resistance captured a lot of sardines and the sweet milk. So up there I used to eat bread with sweet milk and sardines. And then my father gave me some sardines in a Jar, 1n a jar, sardines, because he didn\u2019t want me to bring the cans in town, then th \u2014 th \u2014 if they find the cans, they will know that they derailed the train. So he says, and when you\u2019re finished eating the sardines, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Andre Zalc _ July 23, 2009 you bury the jar. So I did that, I buried the jar. But I didn\u2019t bury the jar deep enough, so the next week, German troops came and they surrounded the town, and they made \u2014 they took us all on the Place de la Gare in the town, and they used to search the houses for the \u2014 search the houses for weapons, because they know in the town there\u2019s resistance who derailed the train. So th \u2014 so I buried that \u2014 the jar on the \u2014 on my landlady\u2019s yard, next to us where we lived. And he used \u2014 he went with the dog on the yard, and the dog smelled the sardines, so the dog was barking. So he didn\u2019t want to dig up the yard, you know, the sardine there, so he says to the dog, du verruickt hund. It means, you crazy dog, why are you smelling here? [indecipherable] and he kicked the dog. And \u2014 and the dog cried a little bit, and he | \u2014 he left with the dog. But if he would every undug that place, he would have find the jar from the sardine, and that could have been dangerous. So the Germans, all day they kept the people prisoner, and they searched the houses, but they didn\u2019t find nothing, so they left, they left. And then \u2014 and then we st \u2014 1n the town we ast \u2014 we \u2014 we stayed under the German occupation. And they came \u2014 they didn\u2019t come all the time, the German, they came once in awhile, and they \u2014 but a lot of Germans went through town to go to Italy, the German convoys. They went to Italy to fight the war, they were fighting the Americans and the British in there. And then they landed in Normandy. They landed in Normandy and then \u2014 the south of France Interview with Andre Zalc \u201c\u00b0 July 23, 2009 was still occupied until August \u2014 until July the 15\", they landed in San Tropez, and they \u2014 and they came up towards \u2014 towards Tresse, but they stayed on the national road. Tresse was liberated by the resistance. And then the [indecipherable] papers [indecipherable] you called, that the people should go to the mountains, should go to the mountains because the town is gonna have \u2014 can be fighting in the town. So the entire population went to the mountains, the civilian population. But the people went to the mountain, they had food with them. And then we went too, my mother, my two sisters, my father was in the mountain, he didn\u2019t go with us. So we went to the mountains. So we stayed there about two days, and we had no more food, so my mother says, take the wheel carriage from your sister, you know, the carriage, and go to town an-and get us \u2014 bring some food. In the \u2014 in the closet, I got some chi- chi beans, you know, some the beans, and \u2014 and some melons. And take it, take it o \u2014 so we have enough food until \u2014 until the liberation, you know. So I got to town, and as I got to town with a friend of mine, a kid, he came with me, the town was all empty. It was like a no man \u2014 like a \u2014 like you see from the \u2014 in the town of the cowboys where everybody\u2019s gone. So we got to town, and we got to the house and we loaded the wagon with the food, the melons and the \u2014 and the beans, and as we want to go get out of the house, two German armored cars come in, and they \u2014 and they go \u2014 they o \u2014 they \u2014 all the bars were locked, yeah, so they go to one the bars, Interview with Andre Zalc ot July 23, 2009 restaurant, and they ripped the doors open. They ripped the doors open and they take out the drink and they put the table outside and they start drinking, the Germans, you know? And they were the Germans who were supposed to protect the town, maybe about 30 Germans with \u2014 had \u2014 with the machine guns, the \u2014 all, you know, ready to \u2014 to fight the war. So my friend say, what we gonna do now? We can\u2019t get out. He said, we stay here until night time, at night time, we\u2019ll get out of the town at night time. So we stayed there until it got dark. And as I walked out, the \u2014 the carriage made noise, because there was no oil. It made eh, eh, eh. So \u2014 so he says, what are we gonna do, it makes too much noise. So we \u2014 we picked up the carriage and we dragged it a little bit, but then we let 1t down again, and it made noise. The Germans heard the noise, they came running with the machine guns in the dark. We saw them. As kids, you can see good at night. So \u2014 so w-we walked up the hill, we had to \u2014 from the fountain, we had to walk the hill towards the mountain. So we saw the German pointing at us, and he \u2014 he starts shooting. So we left the carriage go. The carriage went against a tree, th \u2014 and broke and the melon starts rolling. So the German starts shooting at the melons, he didn\u2019t know what it was. He starts shooting at the melon, and we escaped, you know, we got up in the mountain, we came back to the woods. So the kid told the French families that we went down and there is full of Germans. So they said, what are you doing in town? Interview with Andre Zalc _ July 23, 2009 So he explains to them, we didn\u2019t have enough food. Said, why didn\u2019t you ask us? So they gave us food, know? And overnight, at night, there was a big for \u2014 a fight between the Americans and the Germans, like artillery and everything. And then \u2014 and then the next day they told us that the \u2014 the town is liberated. So we didn\u2019t know, we thought we were the only two 1n the town, but there were the \u2014 the resistance was in town too, and they killed all the Germans, the 30 Germans, and they lined them up on the sidewalk like sardines, they\u2019re sardines.

And then they \u2014 they buried them outside the town, you know, they buried all the Germans, and when we came down from the mountains, they were all dead, y\u2019 know? And \u2014 and then they captured about hundred \u2014 200 Germans, prisoners who surrendered to the \u2014 from the \u2014 from another part of the town. And they had them prisoner, and the resistance had to interrogate them. Every German was interrogated. There was [indecipherable] from the resistance just to write everything down.

So I stayed in the town, and the town was full of Germans. They were all going to Africa in those days, they were fighting in Africa. That was like in 1940 \u2014 end of 1942. And the town was full of Germans, and then there was two Italian ships leaving, with the Italian troops.
