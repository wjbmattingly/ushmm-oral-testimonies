So when he came home, his to \u0152 his uniform was all torn up. And I remember that, that we picked him up and we brought him back home. At home he took off his uniform and he wore regular clothes, and he could play piano. On the weekend he played piano, was a \u0152 was a nice atmosphere in th e house. And then \u0152 a-a-and then in the \u0152 in the \u0152 in the summer, some other kids cam e to \u0152 to stay with us. All are kids from French officers, from French officers. They came for the summer because their parents were busy, so they came, they had like a vacation with us, you know. And the house was very nice, around the house was a lot of chestnut trees, chestnut trees. And we used to \u0152 we used to take the chestnut and eat the chestnut. And \u0152 and we used to play games outside, you know , with a ball, you know, the \u0152 called ba- Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 18balloon prisonnier ; was a special game we used to play. Th-They had two party, like the two camps, and the ca \u0152 the guys in the middle, they were in the middle and we had to hit them with the ball, you know, yeah, it was like a football, you know, like a big ball. And it was very nice there, but th-the \u0152 I got along very good there with the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 the big boy who used to come back for \u0152 in the summer, he had no school. He was \u0152 he wanted to be the boss of ever ybody, and if you didn\u2122t listen to him, you had fricti on with him. I used to get into fights with him sometimes, you know. Bernard , his name was. But \u0152 and then later, maybe a couple weeks later, a kid came from \u0152 he was a son of a French officer, a navy officer, and he slept in my room. And he \u0152 I got friendly with him, and he saw that I have friction with Bernard. So he said, well \u0152 well, what does he want from you? I say, he wants to be the boss. He said, leave him up to me, you know. Because there was a \u0152 a girl came from Paris, and she \u0152 Bernard used to \u0152 used to be like his cousin, but the gi \u0152 the fr \u0152 the kid from the Fren ch officer who came \u0152 stayed with us, he liked \u0152 he tried to make conversation with the girl, and Bernard got mad at him. So that caused \u0152 caused frict ion, so he had a fight with Bernard, and after that Bernard became like a \u0152 like a lamb, he didn\u2122t \u0152 he had no more power, you know, because he took over the power, know? And he was my friend, he slept with me in the room, you know. And we used to \u0152 we used to get a \u0152 a ba \u0152 a wash once a Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 19week, the \u0152 a \u0152 a shower. The \u0152 the dau \u0152 the sister of Mademoiselle Milan(ph) used to be in charge of lam \u0152 washing the kids once a week, you know, we used to get the shower. And the rest of the week we washed \u0152 washed our teeth by hand, you know, with cold water. And \u0152 and I stayed by Mademoiselle Milan (ph) like about almost two years, you know, almost two years I stayed with her. And my father used to write to me letters. It was in the \u0152 in Yiddish, but not written in Hebrew, was written in Latin, know? [indecipherable] So I used to get those letters from him, and then \u0152 and \u0152 an d then they deci \u0152 my moth er got out of the camp and she joined my father in Tresse, and I was then \u0152 I was \u0152 they brought me back to \u0152 they send me back to Tresse. And when I left, I didn\u2122t see Mademoiselle Milan(ph). She was a \u0152 because she actually thought I was her son after a while. She\u2122s a \u0152 knit things for me, sweaters and everything. And when I left, I left with a sister-in-law of a sister, who came to stay with us, and she took me to Marseilles, to [indecipherable] and I met my mother there, at the railroad station. She came to Marseilles to pick me up with Lucie. And my mother couldn\u2122t speak French, and I couldn\u2122t \u0152 I had forgotten the Jewish \u0152 Yiddish, you know, I\u2122d forgotten Yiddish. So I couldn\u2122t \u0152 I had a hard time speaking to my mother. I spoke in French and Lucie translated. Lucie learned French, you know, she [indecipherable] and Lucie translated to my mother, and it took me a couple weeks to get back to the language, Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 20to Yiddish, to speak, because my mother didn\u2122t speak Flemish, she spoke only Yiddish. I spoke Flemish because I learned Flemish as a kid in Belgium in school. So \u0152 so I came \u0152 I came to Tresse, and in Tresse \u0152 I \u0152 I went to school in Tresse. And I had to \u0152 I \u0152 my Mademoiselle Milan(ph), they spoke of \u0152 her \u0152 th-they had a Parisian accent in their French. So when they heard the Parisian accent, the kids used to make fun of me like I\u2122m a Parisian. So it took me months to get back to \u0152 to get \u0152 to get back the accent of \u0152 to get the Marseilles accent, you know, like the kids in school. And then I was part of th e kids in school, you know, the \u0152 the French accent. So then a \u0152 ash \u0152 in tre \u0152 in Tresse I stayed, since I came back from Madame Milan(ph), maybe four or five months, and then the ozay (ph) came to us, and they took me and Lucie and they took us to San Raphael to \u0152 for \u0152 for the summer, for two months. So I went to [indecipherable] in San Raphael in the \u0152 in the \u0152 I forgot the name of the \u0152 of the camp in San Raphael . You \u0152 you remember the name? A2: Villa Marianne. ",
                " Yeah, Villa Marianna(ph). And up there was a nice villa, where every day we used to go to the b each to swim. But we had no food, it was hu \u0152 we were hungry. And at the beach, we used to wait for \u0152 French couples used to come on the beach, and they used to have melon. And when th ey li \u0152 left the place where they stayed, Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 21the blanket and everything, they left th e melon, you know, cu t, the melon. And when they cut the melon, they just cut the top, and there was like melon left. So we used to take that and eat that. That was \u0152 that was a \u0152 a big thing to us to grab the melon from the people when they le \u0152 when they left. And in San Raphael , we \u0152 we used to go to school, we had to marc h to school, maybe about four miles every day to school. We had to march in \u0152 in step s. If you didn\u2122t march in steps, the \u0152 the cadres(ph) who used to wa-watch you, they used to hit you, you know? One day I had the fight with one of the cadres(ph). Because I wasn\u2122t in step, he got mad at me and we had a big fight. And another cadre(ph) came and he fou \u0152 he helped him hit me, you know, like \u0152 had like a big fight with him. And in school, we used to eat lunch in school, we used to br \u0152 they used to give us a sandwich in school, used to \u0152 used to take with us a sandwich. And in school there was the kids who came from the farms, and they had big sandwiches. So we used to give them marbles sometime and they used to give us a sandwich, be cause they were not hungry, the kids from the farms. So I used to have a kid who used to give me his sandwich. And I used to give him marbles, different things, bells. And then finally one day he came to school, he wouldn\u2122t give us his sandwich. Cause the sandwich, I used to split it with my other buddies from the \u0152 from the \u0152 from the Villa Marianna(ph). So \u0152 so he [indecipherable] I say, why didn \u0152 why didn\u2122t you give us sandwich? He said, my Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 22mother says I shouldn\u2122t give to m \u0152 th e sandwich to strange kids, because you people are not French, she say, you know, like he was a little racist. So \u0152 so, when he threw away the sandwich, I got him, and it was like a big barrel in the yard, and I \u0152 I pushed his head in the barrel, you know, in order to get the sandwich. So he told his mother that I roughed him up, because we took the sandwich from him. So the mother came to school. In those days ther e was no gasoline, they had horses, and the mother had a nice carriage with a horse like a racing horse, and she had a whip, an umbrella, and she had her \u0152 her father on the carriage too. But the father was senile, he was very old. He was on the horse too. And she went to the principal, and sh-she argued with the principal that we beat him up, the kids from the Villa Marianna(ph) beat him up. So I had to go to see the principal. So the \u0152 the principal said to me, what\u2122s the matter? How come you hit hi m beca \u0152 and took his sandwich? So I said no, he gave us his sand wich, then he didn\u2122t want to give us his sandwich no more. So we \u0152 we were hungry, so we took the san \u0152 so the principal explained to the mother that the kids in \u0152 in the \u0152 in the home, they don\u2122t have too much food, so they dependen t on that sandwich. And he \u0152 he gave a \u0152 he gave them the sandwich and then he stopped giving us the sandwich. So the principal made before that, all that stuff happened, he made conversation with me, and he was in the second World War in Belgium as a soldier, a French soldier. And he was very Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 23friendly with me because h-he knew Belgium. So he explained to the mother that she gotta speak to the son, it\u2122s not \u0152 they\u2122re not malicious kids, they\u2122re like hungry, you know? So the mother changed \u0152 change d, and she told the kid to give us a sandwich. So, since that time, we used to get a sandwich from the kid. It was a big, big country bread. Th-The French used to make bread, round bread like that, like the Italian country bread, y\u2122know? And the m \u0152 he used to give us a sandwich, and ri \u0152 in the beginning we didn\u2122t want to ta ke a sandwich, we didn\u2122t want no trouble with him. He said, no, no, no, the pr incipal knows about it, you can take the sandwich and have your sand wich. My mother said I should give you the sandwich. So there was a \u0152 a success there with the sandwich, you know, in that school. And then a \u0152 and then a \u0152 at \u0152 I stayed there maybe another month, and then I went back to Tresse, to my \u0152 to my father and my mother. And \u0152 and I used to \u0152 I used to go see my father in the mounta ins, you know, where he us ed to cut the woods? And that became like the \u0152 the resistance. It b ecame like a stronghold of the resistance. And then one day \u0152 my mother used to gi ve me food to bring to my father, you know, like food that she made that he liked. And I w \u0152 I was on the way to leave town to go to the mountains, a German patrol were in town, German troops. And the patrol, they went with me for awhile, you know, and they ask me where I\u2122m going. I said to, you know, my grandmother, I\u2122m going to see my grandmother. So, Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 24th-they walked a little bit with me. Maybe somebody squealed that I\u2122m going to see my father. So \u0152 so the \u0152 the German patrol, the German officer heard like noise in the bushes, because there was a lot of lizards there and even snakes. So he says in German, I understood what he said, he says [speaks German here]. Let\u2122s \u0152 let\u2122s go back. Let\u2122s not go with them, because it\u2122s dangerous areas, like a jungle, he said. [speaks German] It means it\u2122s like a jungle. So he \u0152 th-the German patrol stayed in town, they ac \u0152 they walked a little bit with me, maybe 200 meters, and then they went back. So I went by myself up to the mountain. It was a big climb, was like maybe four or five hours until I got up there. And at that time, they derailed a German train. And when they derailed the German train, there were sardines, they captured a lot of sardines and weapons. There was trains going to Italy that they derailed. And there were \u0152 there were \u0152 the train had sardines and sweet milk, because the German women who used to go to Italy to meet their husbands, who were in the German army, used to have sweet milk for their babies. And when they derailed the train, the French resistance captured a lot of sardines and the sweet milk. So up there I used to eat bread with sweet milk and sardines. And then my father gave me some sardines in a jar, in a jar, sardines, because he didn\u2122t want me to bring the cans in town, then th \u0152 th \u0152 if they find the cans, they will know that they derailed the train. So he says, and when you\u2122re finished eating the sardines, Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 25you bury the jar. So I did that, I buried the jar. But I didn\u2122t bury the jar deep enough, so the next week, German troops came and they surrounded the town, and they made \u0152 they took us all on the Place de la Gare in the town, and they used to search the houses for the \u0152 search the houses for weapons, becaus e they know in the town there\u2122s resistance who derailed the train. So th \u0152 so I buried that \u0152 the jar on the \u0152 on my landlady\u2122s yard, next to us wh ere we lived. And he used \u0152 he went with the dog on the yard, and the dog smelled the sardines, so the dog was barking. So he didn\u2122t want to dig up the yard, you know, th e sardine there, so he says to the dog, du verr\u00fcckt hund. It means, you crazy dog, why are you smelling here? [indecipherable] and he kicked the dog. And \u0152 and the dog cried a little bit, and he l \u0152 he left with the dog. But if he would every undug that place, he would have find the jar from the sardine, and that could have been dangerous. So the Germans, all day they kept the people prisoner, and they searched the houses, but they didn\u2122t find nothing, so they left, they left. And then \u0152 and then we st \u0152 in the town we ast \u0152 we \u0152 we stayed under the German occupation. And they came \u0152 they didn\u2122t come all the time, the German, they came once in awhile, and they \u0152 but a lot of Germans went through town to go to Italy, the German convoys. They went to Italy to fight the war, they were fighting the Americans and the British in there. And then they landed in Normandy . They landed in Normandy and then \u0152 the south of France Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 26was still occupied until August \u0152 until July the 15th, they landed in San Tropez , and they \u0152 and they came up towards \u0152 towards Tresse, but they stayed on the national road. Tresse was liberated by the resistance. And then the [indecipherable] papers [indecipherable] you called, that the people should go to the mountains, should go to the mountains because the town is gonna have \u0152 can be fighting in the town. So the entire population went to the mountains , the civilian population. But the people went to the mountain, they had food with them. And then we went too, my mother, my two sisters, my father was in the mountain, he didn\u2122t go with us. So we went to the mountains. So we stayed there about two days, and we had no more food, so my mother says, take the wheel carriage from your sister, you know, the carriage, and go to town an-and get us \u0152 bring some food . In the \u0152 in the closet, I got some chichi beans, you know, some th e beans, and \u0152 and some mel ons. And take it, take it o \u0152 so we have enough food until \u0152 until the liberation, you know. So I got to town, and as I got to town with a friend of mine, a kid, he came with me, the town was all empty. It was like a no man \u0152 like a \u0152 like you see from the \u0152 in the town of the cowboys where everybody\u2122s gone. So we got to town, and we got to the house and we loaded the wagon with the food, the melons and the \u0152 and the beans, and as we want to go get out of the house, two German armored cars come in, and they \u0152 and they go \u0152 they o \u0152 they \u0152 a ll the bars were locked, yeah, so they go to one the bars, Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 27restaurant, and they ripped the doors open. They ripped the doors open and they take out the drink and they put the table outside and they start drinking, the Germans, you know? And they were the Germ ans who were supposed to protect the town, maybe about 30 Germans with \u0152 had \u0152 with the machine guns, the \u0152 all, you know, ready to \u0152 to fight the war. So my friend say, what we gonna do now? We can\u2122t get out. He said, we stay here until night time, at night time, we\u2122ll get out of the town at night time. So we stayed there until it got dark. And as I walked out, the \u0152 the carriage made noise, because there was no oil. It made eh, eh, eh. So \u0152 so he says, what are we gonna do, it makes too much noise. So we \u0152 we picked up the carriage and we dragged it a little bit, but then we let it down again, and it made noise. The Germans heard the noise, they came running with the machine guns in the dark. We saw them. As kids, you can see good at night. So \u0152 so w-we walked up the hill, we had to \u0152 from the fountain, we had to walk the hill towards the mountain. So we saw the German pointing at us, and he \u0152 he starts shooting. So we left the carriage go. The carriage went against a tree, th \u0152 and broke and the melon starts rolling. So the German starts shoot ing at the melons, he didn\u2122t know what it was. He starts shooting at the melon, an d we escaped, you know, we got up in the mountain, we came back to the woods. So the kid told the French families that we went down and there is full of Germans. So they said, what are you doing in town? Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 28So he explains to them, we didn\u2122t have enough food. Said, why didn\u2122t you ask us? So they gave us food, know? And overnight , at night, there was a big for \u0152 a fight between the Americans and the Germans, like artillery and everything. And then \u0152 and then the next day they told us that the \u0152 the town is liberated. So we didn\u2122t know, we thought we were the only two in the town, but there were the \u0152 the resistance was in town too, and they killed all the Germans, the 30 Germans, and they lined them up on the sidewalk like sardines, they\u2122re sardines. And they took everything away from them in a blanket. You know, their possession, their rings, their lighters, their \u0152 their rifles, everything, their machine guns. They\u2122re the Schmeisser machine gun, that was the \u0152 the best machine gun. And they took everything away, and they were all dead. And then they \u0152 they buried them outside the town, you know, they buried all the Germans, and when we came down from the mountains, they were all dead, y\u2122know? And \u0152 and then they captured about hundred \u0152 200 Germans, prisoners w ho surrendered to the \u0152 from the \u0152 from another part of the town. And they had them prisoner, and the resistance had to interrogate them. Every German was interrogated. There was [indecipherable] from the resistance just to write everything down. So they used to use me as translator, know, and interrogate all these German, everything was written down, all the \u0152 where they\u2122re born, how m \u0152 how many years in the army and everything. Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 29And then one German, he was very scared, and he said that he comes from a socialist family, because he noticed that the resistance had the h-hammer and the sickle on their he \u0152 on their y \u0152 beret, you kn ow? So \u0152 so he says to \u0152 to me, we c \u0152 I \u0152 we \u0152 I come from a socialist family, don\u2122t kill us, don\u2122t kill us. So he was afraid the French resistance would kill him. So I told him, he says, yeah, today they\u2122re all socialists, you know? And before, they were all Nazis, now they\u2122re socialists, the guy \u0152 the officer of the resistance said. And then \u0152 and then as I interrogate the Germans, they took away this guy was very scared, and we interrogate them separately. And he says, the officer of the resistance, he says, ask him where the officers are. He said the officers, they in the wood, they wouldn\u2122t surrender. He say, in which wood? He say, in the same wood where you captured us. So we surrounded the woods, and \u0152 and the offer \u0152 one officer came out, they had no food, he came out to eat some grapes outside the woods were \u0152 were grapes. And that was the time when the grapes are ripe, you know, August. So he \u0152 he took in the helmet some grapes and he came back. And they told him to stop, he wouldn\u2122t stop, so they shot him. So the other officer came out, he said, Hans, Hans, was ist los? It mean, Hans, Hans, what happened? So they \u0152 so they told him to stop, so he wouldn\u2122t stop, they shot him too.

And he kept the leather, leftover leather he kept it for himself to make shoes, so he didn\u2122t \u0152 it didn\u2122t cost us nothing, the sandals. So he made sandals for me and Lucie and we had the sandals way back to Belgium we had those sandals. They were made like unbelievable. And th at was the \u0152 the profit because through me they got the German officers. If not they wouldn\u2122t know the German officers were in the woods, you know? So \u0152 and then the \u0152 they had the German prisoners, they didn\u2122t kill them. They turn them over to the Americans much later, know? They use them. Because I met some of those German soldiers who were \u0152 that I interrogate, I met them later in Marseilles. They used to clean the beach, the mines on the beach. And then in Marseilles \u0152 I came to live in Marseilles. From Tresse I Interview with Andre Zalc July 23, 2009 33went to live in Marseilles.

So my mother made like a par \u0152 like a package of food, and I took the bus to Marseilles. In those days, there was only one bus going to tr \u0152 Marseilles, and one bus coming home.

They were all going to Africa in those days, they were fighting in Africa. That was like in 1940 \u0152 end of 1942. And the town was full of Germans, and then there was two Italian ships leaving, with the Italian troops.
