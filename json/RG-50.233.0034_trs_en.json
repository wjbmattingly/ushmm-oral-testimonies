They were taking these mud baths and the mud things -- I hated it. I only got to go once. After that we went to Kimpolung, you know, a lot of people were there. We had a river, in German it\u2019s called the Prut River, we used to go every day there. In the summer, whenever there were no threat of pogroms. Every -- I remember distinctly, I don\u2019t know with what, whether there was a real schedule, every two months, every three months, but I know that every once in awhile, when the rumor came out, we had to go in hiding.

It was the Germans afterwards. First thing they did. It was a plaza like; 1t was a big temple. It was an orthodox; we didn\u2019t know anything about conservative or reform then. So the women\u2019s balcony was up there and the men were down there. It was a very beautiful plaza and they went in and they made all the Jews dig a grave. 6 They took Rabbi Mark and they absolutely tortured him, shot him that he fell inside the grave, inside that pit.."

I remember on four occasions, my father was already standing, was all the men together. Something always happened and I cannot give you an explanation. Somehow, that they were saved. Either somebody called them away or something, I don\u2019t know what it was but it was dug. The hole was dug in our garden and my father was standing around. My mother and my sister was sitting there, you know, from the window. Only the men. Something happened, either with the war, I don\u2019t remember what it was but somehow he was saved. His father died like this too. So error and fear is what I grew up with. Possibly I can\u2019t remember because of that; I thought I pushed it out of my life. There were better times when we came to Bucharest. As I said before, my mother -- my father -- my relatives actually in Bucharest decided that -- little by little to bring us out of there. Because Czernowitz was very bad. My mother got somehow a certificate that she needs an operation in the capitol, in Bucharest. As two minors, we went with her."

So we were hidden for a good three months in somebody\u2019s house until that thing blew away, whatever it was. It took my father seven months to walk from town to town; from the northern Romania into the capitol, Bucharest. He arrived almost before the Germans started to bomb. That\u2019s how we were reunited and we had four years of constant bombardment in Bucharest."

We were under -- well they were building, the building was already done with, what is it called? not for bomb, for shelter, was an air raid shelter down there. We practically lived there because it was -- in the morning, the British, then the silver, the Americans came; then the Russians. So we were back and forth, back and forth. At least they didn\u2019t have time for the Jews. A lot of people were killed in 7 shelters because the bombing it had to be. It was such a mixed feeling. We knew the bombs, they coming to bomb; but we were happy they were coming. So a lot of people perished in the -- Jews and non-Jews, I imagine."

So we had only about a block to go. My sister and I never saw the end of it until we got to, I think, America or Cuba, the end of the movie, Intermezzo.

            "question": "In Bucharest. What kind of school did you go to? When did you start going back to school?",
            "answer": "After I -- they hold an exam for those, the equivalency. I was taught at home; so were many others. We went into junior high school. The junior high school and high school and I got my baccalaureate. What is it called? Finish of high school, the big exam. There was an oral exam and a written exam. The oral exam -- they were communists, of course, and you couldn\u2019t say anything about ---. You had to say, you had to lie. They twisted history a lot and you had to go along with that, otherwise they failed you. And it was a very tough exam, a whole day exam. I remember my mother fasting on that day because we knew we were trying to get out and she wanted me to have that document with me. I passed it and then there was years until we got the visa for, the transit visa for Hungary and Austria but the exit visa expired. So we went for two years until finally it happened. We took a lot of our stuff, like some china and some crystal that were in the family for a long, long time and we shipped it to Israel to my aunt. That\u2019s how come I have these -- whatever pictures I have. Because when we left Bucharest, we were told that youll come crawling back and you don\u2019t even need anything to take with you. They examined my teeth and the hair for diamonds and for whatever. My father buried a lot of stuff. They now have a refrigerator factory there so there\u2019s no chance of going to get that. We came out and went to Switzerland first and my father got some money out from what he had long before the war. If we didn\u2019t 8 have that money, we could never have made it. We bought some clothes and we tried to go to consulates, to get a visa. Switzerland only gave you so much stay and you couldn\u2019t stay any longer and they would not prolong it. So we came to Italy. In Italy we went to the American embassy and they informed us that we can\u2019t get a visa. We lived in Italy for eight months."

According to my father\u2019s cousin in America; he said that\u2019s the closest, forty minutes. So you wait a couple of weeks and then you\u2019ll come here. A couple of weeks turned out to be ---."

            "answer": "So we chose Cuba. We went to the Cuban embassy in Italy and we got our visa. Then he was holding off. Every time we go to check when there\u2019s a boat to Cuba, he said, there\u2019s no boat to Cuba. He thought maybe they\u2019ll go away, maybe we\u2019 ll be able ---. He just ---. We wanted to go to Israel and we were advised not to. We went through a lot so much already and I mean, \u201948; the State was born in \"48. This was \u00b047 and there was a lot of things going on there and so finally, he couldn\u2019t hold anymore and we took a boat. We went to Cuba. We had falsified papers in Italy, I want you to know, from the Romanian government \u2014in-exile because we only had a visa for 30 days and it came, what, eight months we stayed there. So they kept falsified on our passport, that we have. We got a Cuban visa and a false Romanian visa. Even the language was not correct because they were a government-in-exile. They forgot how to speak Romanian from King Michael\u2019s. So we got our Cuban visa and we came to Cuba. We stayed in Cuba and waited and waited."

The biggest hurricanes, that was Cuba. Then we came here to the United States and my father again went into a different business. He -- his cousin was in knitwear so he worked with him for a while and then he opened a wholesale store, down on Ludlow Street. He was selling to stores and he was manufacturing himself. In other words, not manufacturing but contracting; sweaters and all kinds of knitwear. Then he had a heart attack and died."

He was number 15, he had cancer in his heart, can you imagine that? They removed almost half of his heart and they replaced the wall with woven, imitated --. He lived for a year and a half. I met Charlie on a blind date. Never knew what a blind date was, always wanted to know. Because in Cuba, there were 8,000 Jews in Cuba and everybody knew everybody, if not intimately, but of everybody. Nobody knows what it means to have it like that, that was it. Now are you going to behave Charlie or do you want me to talk for you or what? {Male voice: Pll do my best}. Pull yourself together and just.
