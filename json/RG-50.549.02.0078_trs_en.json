In fact, this was built -- when this house was being built, Jews were still not allowed to have property, real estate property in Zagreb.

But -- but there was a lot of hope still going on. There was a government in exile which was [indecipherable] that was in -- in -- in London and then came back into the United States. We th -- both my brother and I thought this was really fun. We arrived in New York and we stayed in a -- in a -- a what do you call it, an apartment hotel, it was da -- it was on 57\" and Sixth. It was called The Salisbury, it was like two or three rooms and a little kitchen in a closet, and a -- and of course, you know, they cleaned up and gave you the -- and gave you fresh laundry and so on and there were pa -- I think there were two bedrooms and some kind of a living room and so on. And I remember going to a five and 10 cents store and we bought all of this crazy china, very cheap stuff, and like four plates and four spoons and so on. And it was sort of like playacting almost. Nobody was aware of really what was going on and how it was going to happen. There was -- we knew, of course, that there were Jews being taken to concentration camps in Austria and Germany, but there was no talk of death camps, and there were none at that time, I don\u2019t believe. And so, we were there. Also, at the same time, this gentleman who was in the mustard business with my father, who was from Belgrade, he -- they came -- no, they may have arrived just a little earlier than we did. There was a girl who was about, I don\u2019t know, two, three ye -- two years younger than I am, and a boy who was maybe a year or two younger than my brother. And it was fun. My mother didn\u2019t have the faintest notion about cooking. This very nice Mrs. Shanser taught her to cook. By that time we had moved to a nice furnished place in river -- in Riverdale in New York. Do you know where that is, across from [indecipherable]"

And however, when we got there, we discovered that there really -- we didn\u2019t have enough knives and forks and we couldn\u2019t function very well with whatever we had, these four spoons and so on. And that place did not have any tablecloth or any -- it - it -- it -- it was the -- it -- actually, the furniture was quite nice, and it was large and quite pleasant. So then my father went to an auction in New York. And this was a extremely sad thing that I\u2019m still -- that is still terribly painful to me. He went to the New York docks, wi -- where there were numerous cra -- not crates, what you call the -- what do you call these things that you send large amounts of furniture, household goods?"

Very, very elaborate -- if you want I\u2019Il show you the thing because it\u2019s kind of amusing -- china, which was obviously bought by a family that was moving to the States with you know, what can we buy that -- that -- of German goods that I -- we\u2019re permitted to take out and so on."

And he -- we found out that he had been in Zagreb the -- this is another thing that has very little to do with me, but in a way maybe it\u2019s interesting. He came from a place called Gradisca originally, which is in the Burgenland, which is on the border of Slovenia and Austria.

So this gentleman from Israel tells me that he originally came from there. His father had a factory in this Burgenland and he told me the name of the town, I think is Firestaat, I\u2019m not quite sure what it was. And he was a refugee with his family in Zagreb and they were very Orthodox and he told me about -- they had a separate synagogue, they had the separate -- it wasn\u2019t a synagogue, it was a separate place where they went to pray or they had that -- I had no idea these people existed.

These were from around Zagreb somewhere and they were dressed -- I will not say that they -- they weren't -- you know, they were wearing jackets, what kids would wear, lederhosen, God forbid. They would wear some jackets and so on and now when I look at these pictures I see how they\u2019re really quite distinct. And apparently these people had a -- had a -- not a synagogue, certainly a place where they gathered and so on. So this gentleman now from -- from -- who came from Israel was telling me about that. By the way, the museum was fantastically helpful to him. They found some books that -- about stuff that his father had told him originally, and he never could check it out and he saw it, tears were going down his face, I mean, it was just unbelievable. But this gentleman told me that he had class and that they were very religious, although not wearing any kind of garb, and that he -- he had the different rabbi. I mean, he didn't know about our rabbis, and so -- he was a child there and so on. Now what I found out later about these peoples -- about this -- this place, Gradisca, which now is Austria, 1s that they had parallel city governments, they had a parallel Jewish and non-Jewish police, a parallel Jewish and non-Jewish fire brigade and various other things like that. So during various holidays they would spell each other."

I was also, at that time very much upset that there was hardly anything on Yugoslavia, very little. But then, it really isn\u2019t surprising because, you know, how many Yugoslav Jews, or how many Yugoslavs really survived who went through it, and there was very little left. Now, I did not mention that at the very beginning, when -- when Yugoslav Jews started coming to New York er -- in 9 the 40\u2019s, they bought a plot in the -- in -- in -- in New Jersey where they formed a c1- a cemetery, which is now quite full. And this apparently is very much what happens, because there were groups from Germany, from Austria, from who knows, the Bukovina and so on, who had plots of their own. And that\u2019s where it is, in New Jersey, in fair -- fair -- Fairview mew -- New Jersey. And there was an association of Yugoslav Jews in the United States, which worked on A, helping people who -- who were totally, you know, bereft of everything and try -- got visas, worked with the State department, worked with various other governments, helped with this restitution business that I told you about.

There were some cameramen as a matter of fact, too, but mostly sound people. And we got there and this group of people started coming out and they recognized me, a bunch of them, and they started asking about my brother, who -- so this was very shortly after the end of war, maybe the war was still on. Yeah, the war was still -- and -- and I had to yell 1 over, you know, hundreds of people to tell them there was no Mario any more. And then another somebody came and so on. And they looked like absolute hell. These were people who had been living in Italy and doing quite well. Had already, you know, gotten things from the various Jewish organizations and had sort of pulled themselves together, but here was the possibility of going to the United States, so wow, great. And it was great, in the end. But they came and they were not allowed - we were behind -- we had barricades, this was yelling through barricades. First thing that happened when they arrived, they made -- before they arrived, they made them give all the clothes, which these people had bought with whatever was left over, let\u2019s, you know, do a bella figura when you arrive here. And they were thrown into 1 -- 1 -- it\u2019s -- 1-1t to be a -- deloused and [indecipherable]. So you got rags. Everything lost its color. They sprayed them with DDT, all these people, I don\u2019t know whether it -- probably DDT, it was awful, they were delousing them and so on. So these were people who had been living a more or less normal life in Italy, who suddenly came. So then it was this big committee, they took them to Oswego into an ex-army camp and put them behind wires -- I mean, behind -- behind -- I think there was even, if I\u2019m not mistaken a -- a -- you know, wire. And was a big scandal. And I remember my father, who at that time I think was the vice-president or whatever, secretary of this association of Yugoslav Jews that were going there to try to calm these people down, who were ju -- a great many were Yugoslav Jews, 2 not all, but a great many as this -- you know, they -- they picked them up 1n Italy, these -- these people had already been saved, I mean, you know. They were in no danger. And so first, you know, this -- this was a whole [indecipherable] and I don\u2019t know exactly how -- well, they fe -- 1t got to be where the point where Mrs. Roosevelt went there to intervene and one day one of these people turned themselves up -- turned up at our door, one of the women who knew where I was, about maybe two or three years younger than I am.

Suddenly she was at our front door in New York on Riverside Drive, and she spent the night we -- my father and sister, she had to go back because otherwise she would have been, I don\u2019t know, I guess a criminal or whatever."
