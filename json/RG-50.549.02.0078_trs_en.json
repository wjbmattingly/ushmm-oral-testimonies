Nobody was aware of really what was going on and how it was going to happen. There was -- we knew, of course, that there were Jews being taken to concentration camps in Austria and Germany, but there was no talk of death cam ps, and there were none at that time, I don\u2122t believe. And so, we were there. Also , at the same time, this gentleman who was in the mustard business with my father, who was from Belgrade, he -- they came -- no, they may have arrived just a little earlier than we did. There was a girl who was about, I don\u2122t know, two, three ye -- two years younger than I am, and a boy who was maybe a year or two younge r than my brother. And it was fun. My mother didn\u2122t have the faintest notion abou t cooking. This very nice Mrs. Shanser taught her to cook.

And that place did not have any tablecloth or any -- it -- it -- it -- it was the -- it -- actually, the furniture was quite nice, and it was large and quite pleasant.

She was the oldest person born in Belgrade who died. So she was probably 98 or so. She had been evacuated during World War I, to England. So anyhow, he go -- he -- Morris, when they opened this reading room there, this lady Vera Wynik was one of the secretaries and they -- she had a terrible time because of the communists wanted -- were -- were threatening her in a horrible way. They -- they wanted whatever secrets, there were no secrets, but they wanted all kinds of information, which she refused to give. And they were harassing her to an awful -- in an awful way, and Morris -- Morris felt -- heard about it later, and he didn\u2122t know, I mean, she was about to commit suicide, and it\u2122s a very sad story. So he was very close to her and he -- he was constantly in touch here and we -- she gave me some of those icons that were there, and -- so, a wonderful woman, whom we visited in Belgrade all -- the first time we went back. And she said to me, do -- I-I\u2122m going back to the paternalistic societies that were going on then -- she said to me, you know, when your father ca me to visit me, he -- because my father went back to Yugoslavia way before we did and Morris said, would you please visit Vera Wynik, giver her my love, see what she needs and so on.
