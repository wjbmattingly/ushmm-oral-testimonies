And I was there, you know. I was very curious to see how \u0152 the houses, nobody\u2122s there. So I must see what\u2122s inside there.

And I look it up, and what was \u0152 I was not interesting in clothing, you know, but I needed to see what \u0152 some kind of literature, what they do. And I found in one place they have been bunch of fives \u0152 five books or six, to \u0152 to write \u0152 writing schoolbooks [indecipherable] .
