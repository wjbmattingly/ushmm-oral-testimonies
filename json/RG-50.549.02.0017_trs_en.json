This is an interview with Bella Mischkinsky, conducted in Gaithersburg, Maryland at the home of Bella\u2019s sister, Irene Glossberg, on June 10th, 1998, by Arwin Donohue.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible, this is tape number one, side A. Okay, I\u2019m going to just -- for the sake of summarizing on tape, say that we're -- we\u2019re going to start out by going back into some of the Holocaust era and pre-war experiences that weren\u2019t discussed in the first interview. So -- and then we\u2019ll -- and then we\u2019 ll focus on the post Holocaust material, after we\u2019ve done some of that. And we\u2019re going to try not to repeat what was already said in the video interview, just -- just to do new stuff. So, why don\u2019t we start out Bella, by you stating your -- your name today and -- and your name at birth.",

My sister 1s my junior. She was born in 1930, her name is Irene, known at that time as Irene Berger. My relationship with my parents was -- it wasn\u2019t close, but it wasn\u2019t antagonistic. My mother was busy working. She was a terrible housekeeper, hated housework, loved to be with people, loved to work. Also, that was not the common standard at that time in Poland. But she was the happiest when she was among people and when she was working. My father had a job, not a very strict one. He was much more educated than my mother. He liked different things than my mother. I could never find a common bond why they ever got married, except the custom in Poland at that time was that -- what do they call? Thedushetimeshat. Some family introduces a man, other family introduces a woman and they decided that they would make a couple and they get married. There was no courting, dating, or any of that. And I imagine that\u2019s why they got married. I never found them very competitive to each other. My father pretty much went his way. He was a terrific mathematician. He loved politics. He loved caf\u00e9s, good life. My mother was just devoted to work, work, work. So I was pretty much left on my own. I would say that my home base was rather my grandmother\u2019s home, where there was somebody there, than my parents home. "

And I was always accepted by my Polish friends, without giving it a thought, whether they Polish or Jewish or whatever. I was never concentrating on those issues. And then, when the Germans came in and I saw that all of a sudden, there is such a difference, it no longer became ble -- it was quite obvious they hated the Jews, for many reasons. First of all, the church was instilling in the Poles -- and that was a Catholic country, the Jews are the killers of Christ. Well, that\u2019s a unforgiven sin committed by the Jews. They killed Jesus, their most believed in person, so there is no love for the Jews. Then there was a certain amount of envy. Not all Jews were rich, but they were comfortable, most of them. And the ones who weren\u2019t were taken care of by the Jews who were more comfortable. Getting rid of the Jews is a big opened field of taking over their possessions, taking over their business. I guess the Jews presented the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Poles of giving them a feeling of superiority. And that wasn\u2019t very pleasing to the Poles. I don\u2019t know whether they did or they didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t judge. But the Jews lived pretty much their own life. They were -- they had their clubs, they had their caf\u00e9s. They had their shows. They were very intellectual, much more than the Poles were. And I\u2019m not giving statistics, I don\u2019t know. But the majority of the Poles were just working people, farmers, whatever. So I think the Jews felt a little superior. Sort of standed off attitude towards other people. They felt they were more righteous, they were more -- but they were separate from the Poles. There was never a togetherness. They maybe worked hand in hand on working places, but there was no special bond of relationships. I never felt it, but then I was a young girl. And I wasn\u2019t that intellectual to dwell in those political things going on. I know that Peelshinsky, who was a leader of Poland, hey, I loved him. He was like -- we called him our daddy. When he died, we stood, saluted the flag, saluted his portrait. Tears were running down our cheeks. But that was a skol -- school attitude.

So we stayed there for about two weeks, hidden in the basement, until one day we hear the Germans civilians coming into the house and chasing us all out. So my husband, who again, had a lot of freedom in Magdeburg and the camp, knew some Russian women who were working in polter too.

So I was with him and all of a sudden one of the meisters, for whom I was working, pointed at me, he says, \u201cShe works for me, she\u2019s Jewish.\u201d So I had to go back. And he wouldn\u2019t go without me, no matter how much I pleaded. So he came back too. And we were on the march towards Berlin. So we crossed the river and found ourselves on the other town -- part of town -- of Magdeburg. Elba was the dividing part -- divided the part in two things, so we found ourselves on the other part. There was a lot of shooting, all night long. It was a miserable night and every time the shooting started, the guards which were sending -- leading us out, made us lie down on the ground and wait until the shooting went over. At one point my husband said, \u201cNext time when they tell us to get out, it\u2019s so dark, we stay put.\u201d Which we did. So the column continued, we stayed behind. We went in the other direction, we didn\u2019t know where we going. We all spoke perving -- perfect German. So we did see some German soldiers, motorcycles and they were ep -- talking to us in German, just complaining about the weather, the shooting and we answered in German like we one of them. And we finally found a place in a house where we hid. We were there for about three days, but we always hid in the basement, just to be sure that we not spotted immediately. Comfort of life was not our priority. And then we hear some people coming upstairs and saying. \u201cI know there are Jews here. We going to come and we going to find them.\u201d Didn\u2019t occur to them to get down to the basement. So we decided it\u2019s time to leave. So, during the day, early in the morning, we, the four of us left. We didn\u2019t know where to go, so we saw a name of a street, passa -- Pashall was the name. So we [indecipherable], that\u2019s in the direction of Pashall, now we know where we going, we going to Pashall. So that\u2019s what he did and there were lots of other people who were walking the streets. We get to a certain part and all of a sudden we see a German installation. But it was too late to turn back without saying, hey, why are they running away -- So we just continued. And a guy from that installation approached us and said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Now, we had a name, so that\u2019s where we are going and he says, \u201cWhy you going there?\u201d And we says, \u201cWell, we have our place there, we used to work there and we going back to our position.\u201d And he says, \u201cWell, I have a problem. The Germans left the installation at night and I came over and there is a beautiful desk I like to take home. But my [indecipherable] broke down. If you not in a hurry, if you can help me bring that home, I would appreciate it.\u201d So we said, \u201cHey, we have no place to go anyway.\u201d So we offered -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B"

At that point, we all found German uniforms in that bunker -- that installation. So we all were dressed in German uniforms. So we said, \u201cWe want to go there, too.\u201d So we made a date with them for the next day to meet. They going to desert their unit, they going to come with us and we all going to go to the Americans. Sounds ridiculous. My husband and the owner of the place where we stayed with, went for a walk, and they found a boat. It didn\u2019t have oars, but it was a boat. So my husband went back, he was very handy. They made oars and they were all ready to go to the amies. So sure enough, next day, we met with the German soldiers, we had a white flag and we all marched to the boat to go over on the other side. As we were doing all that, some civilians come over and he said they use the boat a day before. They went over to the Americans, but they were wearing civilian clothes, so the Americans send them back. They were only taking prisoners of war. So at that point, we had the uniforms, we were seven German soldiers. Two women in German uniforms. We took the boat, a white flag and they were all -- the German soldiers had all their guns ready, if the Hitler yugen will stops them, they going to shoot. We got to the other side of the Elba, we pushed the boat into the water so they couldn\u2019t send us back. And now we were waiti -- wait -- waiting for the Americans.

It\u2019s the first time I met my sister-in-law. Peoria was a small town, with very pretty -- with a very affluent Jewish population. We were the first survivors they ever met and were very nice to us, offered us money and this and that. Well, we really weren\u2019t interested in getting money, we were interested in establishing a life, which was very difficult, because we didn\u2019t speak English. My husband was a civil engineer. Couldn\u2019t get very far without English. I had no trade, no profession, so things were difficult. My sister-in-law was not the most pleasant person. She just lost her husband, she was very jealous of Irene, because she had a son pretty much Irene\u2019s age and we showered Irene with our love. She was a part of our life. So things were not easy. I finally got a job at Princess Peggy. They were making casual housedresses. But I didn\u2019t know anything about the sewing machine, couldn\u2019t communicate with the girls -- they were very nice to me, so they put me with a bunch of fabric to put together. I never accomplished anything, so towards the end of the day, the supervisor came over, ripped what I did, took her five minutes, she put it together. It was not a pleasant way of life. And then we got letter that my mother and her boyfriend are arriving to New York. So my husband said, \u201cFine. I am going to pick them up and you stay with Irene here.\u201d So that\u2019s what we did. He got to New York, he writes me a letter saying, \u201cI want you to meet me in New York.\u201d And the responsibility of telling to my sister-in-law that we are leaving her was up to me. It wasn\u2019t very pleasant. She was very unpleasant. So Irene and I just bordered the train and left for New York. He had no intentions of coming back to Peoria. So now we are in New York --"

And we lived there for one year and then we bought a house. And I figured out, hey, that\u2019s going to be my palace. We stayed there for about maybe a year -- a year and a half and one of the people we knew from Germany came to the States and his cousin came from Uruguay to visit him. That guy, Mr. Kussman, was living in Schenectedy, New York. And he was a builder. But he needed someone to build a plan for water supply. Well, my husband had that qualification and he said, \u201cI give you a job in Schenectedy. It\u2019s going to be your field, but you have to make up your mind.\u201d So over the weekend, my husband approached me and he says, \u201cWhat do you think if we move to Schenectedy?\u201d Well, that was the last thing I wanted to do in my life. \u201cWhat\u2019s Schenectedy? I don\u2019t know a living soul, my friends are in New York, we have a house, my sister is here.\u201d She was already married, you know. And then I thought it over.

There were no other jobs available in Schenectedy, it was a GE town. Also the economic situation in the States was not very hot -- hot. He could not get a job for about eight weeks. Trying all cities, whoever we had friends. Boston, other places, until finally he got a job -- read in the paper that someone needs a supervisor of construction, he got a job. He moved in with Carl and Irene in New York and I stayed with Jeff in Schenectedy until I was ready to sell the house there. In the meantime, Andy was born, Irene and Carl\u2019s son. They came to visit often. So my husband was in New York, I was in Schenectedy and after Andy was about eight months old, Carl and Irene said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s time for us to look for better quarters for our son.\u201d They had a furnished apartment in Astoria. So they went on a search for a house. We had very little money. Irene and Carl had very little money. Carl was going to law school. Irene was working a little bit until Andy was born. Anyway, to make a long story short, we found a house in Beachhurst. It was a old house which needed an awful lot of work. But the price was good. We took a 3000 dollar mortgage from my parents. We bought the house and we moved in. And we spent five years of fixing it, because we didn\u2019t have enough money to fix all of 1t and my husband was the only one who could do things. So we spent five long years, weekend and weekend out, building walls, tearing up ceilings Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection and so on. And we lived in that house. Well, I just sold it two months ago. So it was not occupied for the past 10 years, because Carl got promoted, he went to bigger things. The house was no longer presentable enough for a big executive of Pete Mullerg. They moved to Cleveland, we stayed in New York. And my husband literally did not have a permanent job. He could not get a permanent job. He was promised a partnership with a boss who was building houses in Brooklyn and he did build a few houses. And the Sunday, they were meeting, his boss dropped dead. That was the end of that."

I worry about it when the year is up.\u201d Well, we made it. He did graduate Dartmouth. But Booby got sick. He was sick for seven years. The job he had, as all his jobs, were a fly by night things.

It just -- a feeling of hey, your whole system of destroying the Jews wasn\u2019t fully, completely accomplished. Here I am, like Mrs. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Big Deal, visiting that place. It was different when we went to Riga. See, Riga was not my hometown. The Latvian Jews, I only met some of them in camp. Hank was brought up there. His family lived there. It was his hometown. So it was different. And we went to Salaspils in Torumbally, where his mother, his sister, who were killed. It\u2019s a different feeling for him, like it was for me in Vilna. But then, I knew a lot of people who eventually were shot and killed in Riga, too. And it\u2019s a peaceful looking place, with nice, full bloom trees and underneath are hundreds of thousands of Jews, killed cold-blooded. Taken in the middle of the night and just shot. Crime? You\u2019re Jewish. That was hard. And then we made a trip to Minsk, which 1s a different story. And we went to a place, Katyn. It\u2019s a place designated for people who were shot by the Russians. Whole villages of people shot by the Russians. By the white and -- it\u2019s White Russia, all right? So they were White Russians were being shot by the Russians because of partisans and -- and they took village after village after village, destroyed it. And it\u2019s a beautiful monument. I mean, you have each city, each town has a little mount of earth and a cross and the eternal life and all that and bells. And every half a minute, the bells are chiming in unison, to remember that. And it was very touching. I could not quite get rid of the feeling, I am so touched, it\u2019s so horrible, but those were White Russians. How many of them participated in killing the Jews and what kind of monuments do you have to memorize the Jews? Well, when I expressed it to Hank, he wasn\u2019t very happy with me. But I felt that way. Yes, and I am not substituting one to another -- one murder doesn\u2019t justify another. But I just couldn\u2019t get rid of the feeling that those were White Russians and how many of them had their hands soiled with Jewish blood, just because of hatred of unknown people, that the Nazis allowed them, get rid of your Jews.

Because they were different than -- from what I knew as a concentration camp. There were no barracks. People weren\u2019t kept there, they were unloaded on the platform and sent to the gas chambers. So that was different than my experiences were. So you saw stones and stones and stones. And they all presented human beings at one point. That was terrible. Auschwitz was not that terrible, because I read about it a lot. I had an idea what it is, I know what the barrack represents, I know what the gas chamber represents. And the reason I was -- I wanted to go to Birkenau- Auschwitz, because Irene was there. So I wanted trace back what her life looked like.

            "answer": "I don\u2019t know. Hank volunteered and I didn\u2019t want to volunteer at the same, together. Stupid, but I didn\u2019t want to. But then when Hank passed away -- yeah, I think it was difficult to -- had to make appointment and na dada, whatever. But when Hank passed away, I had no problem talking to Arwin and saying I would like to volunteer. And she did it immediately. She was a great influence for me to volunteer in the Holocaust Museum -- for the Holocaust Museum. I loved her approach, her attitude, her calm efficient way of doing things. I felt very comfortable, almost like I have a protector who is taking Hank\u2019s place. And I was very -- not sorry, but sad when she left, because I just felt -- she\u2019s still going to be my friend or I am going to be her friend, let\u2019s put it that way, but it\u2019s a distance away and things have a way of slipping by. But I found the people at the museum very friendly. The young man who\u2019s responsible for my directions, what\u2019s his name? Dillon. The young man who is taking care of my work in the archives, Dillon is very helpful, very understanding. I just love to work -- I almost feel I work for him, because he represents the person I respond to, and he taught me a lot of things. I just love him. It\u2019s too bad he is so young or too bad I am so old. But I love that guy. And he\u2019s -- I think a -- a big asset to the museum. But so are other people. I work a half a day at the museum on the floor and it gives me a chance to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0017 $1 interact with the public and other volunteers and that\u2019s a great experience. I think the museum -- or the people I work with are trying to make the museum a very interesting place for the visitors and a very comfortable place. I think they all obliging, they all courteous and it\u2019s good to see so much people coming -- so many people coming and visiting. And what\u2019s also good to see, that they not necessarily Jewish. So it\u2019s good to see an interest among other people, but just Jews who have the impression that the Holocaust museum 1s just his m- their museum. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a educational institution for everyone and I hope it\u2019s going to stay that way. I just don\u2019t want the Holocaust to be put together in a bag with any other killings of other countries, because the Holocaust was a unique experience, different than the killings and murdering of people which took place in other countries. It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s -- I advocate it, I am just saying that I feel the Jewish Holocaust was strictly a Jewish issue. What one country, with so much education, was so susceptible to murder of hundreds of thousands of other people, only because they were Jewish. They weren\u2019t fighting for anything. They didn\u2019t defend anything. They had no weapons to fight back. They were just led -- the term is the Jews went like sheep. Well, they were led like sheep. I do resent the criticisms that Jews did not fight back and they went like sheep. Well, every survivor fought back, because he is alive. And lots of them -- thousands of them who wanted a life, fought back too. To survive a concentration camp run by the Nazis, the White Russians, by the Latvians, was a fight. It was a struggle to survive. And I felt a little bit resentful when in the beginning the question was, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fight?\u201d Who is asking the question? People who have their dignity? Who are not hungry? Who are not being separated? Who are not being treated like vermin? They are asking why didn\u2019t you fight back? My question is, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fight for us, with all the things you had available, if you just choose to use them?\u201d And saying we didn\u2019t know 1s not an answer, because it\u2019s not a fact. So, I did resent that. I think every survivor is a hero. I think every inmate of a concentration camp was a hero. Yes, and we survivors are heroes because we proved that they were not as efficient as they wanted to be and they did leave so many Jews still alive. Jews who became human beings who are assets to every country they live in. That\u2019s, to me, a hero."
