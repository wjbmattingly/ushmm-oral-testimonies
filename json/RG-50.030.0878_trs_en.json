My friend Karowlka (ph) taught me a lot of things; how to \u0152 how \u0152 how to \u0152 I\u2122ll give you an example of something \u0152 to go fishing was a \u0152 a very interesting occ \u0152 pri \u0152 you know, business for us, and \u0152 because the town was surrounded by lakes. But you need a fishing pole. Well, that\u2122s very easy. You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that\u2122s just the right length and the right size, and you cut it down, and that\u2122s your fishing pole. Now you need fishing line. Well, you can\u2122t use just anything. But there are white horses, and white horses have long, white tails, and you just pull out a few strands here and there, and you braid them, and it turns into the \u0152 a-and then you \u0152 you have like a \u0152 maybe a two or three foot length, and you get about six or seven of those, and now you have a terrific fishing line. The \u0152 the bobber is simple, a goose quill and a cork, and you put a hole in the cork and you put the goose quill through it, and then you Interview with Al Jaffee May 21, 2016 101run your line through it. The only think you have to buy is the fish hook. Nobody knows how to make a fish hook. And the st ore always has fish hooks. So we went fishing all the time with these things, and we caught the fish, we fried the fish and we ate the fish and we had a wonderful time. But we also \u0152 you could buy sleds in the wintertime, but my brother Harry and I loved to play \u0152 play with wood, and we would make our own sleds, they were simp le things, but \u0152 but we di \u0152 we didn\u2122t bother wi \u0152 sl-sleds were really so cheap that we were able to get a few pennies to buy sleds.

It just got dark, and the p \u0152 the parents of our friends said, you better go home now. And now we got a couple of k ilometers to walk in absolute pitch darkness, imagining that there are wolves out there. So, you make a lantern.
