And -- but the only difference was, he was not a fanatic either. We had been home -- three brothers and sister, we always brought home Zionist organization\u2019s books. We had to do always -- parents, my father\u2019s j-job was to keep us busy. So we could do anything. Our education, he never rejected it, or tell us he want us to read.

But after we had been 15 years old, we still went for education, Jewish religion, and higher learnings. But my father had enough, was wise enough to see that the world is changing, and you cannot stay always in -- how he would like it, so he gave us more -- all brothers and sisters, freedom.

This was in January, must been around July or August, and I was integrated for Gestapo, and beaten unmerciful, but I was -- the most fear was, for me actually, beating, because they used to beat me when I was interviewed by Gestapo, til I passed out. When I passed out, they didn\u2019t have running water, over there at the police station, they dragged me out to a well, where they poured water on my head, and I was revived, dra- dragged back inside, and again beating, and beating. And this was my biggest fear of it was beating. And I begged the officer who interviewed me to shoot me on the spot. He laughed, and he told me, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. You don\u2019t nec -- you don\u2019t have to expect tha -- that you will live. But we finish you off not when you want it, we finish you when we want it.\u201d This was the answer."

            "num": 11,
            "question": "Did you ever know why they were questioning you, and what information they wanted to get from you?",
            "answer": "Yes, it\u2019s a big story, I gonna try to -- just to tell you in more details. We had business, all kind of bus -- my parents started actually, with a grocery store, good business. But when my mo -- my oldest brother, Haim, when he was more or less in his 20\u2019s, early 20\u2019s, and he slowly took over business by our parents, and he always looked at a food store, little grocery store, we could make a living, he made a living, but he couldn\u2019t make money all the -- actually for a better life. So he started it, he -- he was a representative -- in our town, small town in Chadbush was four smaller factories. They all produced the same product, more or less, like knives, forks. And the mostly of it, it was not expensive, it wasn\u2019t the most cheapest actually, tableware, what you can have it. And this used to be shipped to Galeetsia, farther down near the Russian border where we had it. And my brother used to supply raw materials, and apparently, I don\u2019t know exactly, but he made always so much percentage on the supplies profit. And this got better and better every time, with more -- and the season mostly in those factories, smaller fat -- f -- smaller factories was about four or five months of the year, where business were real good, and about six, seven months were slack. And they had a rough time to meet payrolls for the workers what they kept on. And my buth -- my brother used to borrow money, actually to those factories, not for a favor, but actually to make some money, too. So they paid so much percentage per month, or whatever, I was not familiar, I was too young to know about business. Then finally he invested in one particular factory, it belongs to a Gentile in out town, his name was Rochinsky. And he had a little bit rough time to repay it, whatever he owed us, So he took -- he proposed my brother to be a partner in the factory. And this went on til war time [indecipherable]. In 1939, when the Germans came in, my brother realized it\u2019s another -- a different era already. We -- as being well and everything, but we realized that we shouldn\u2019t show that we had any interest in the factory, because we know it, that Jewish property was confiscated right from the beginning. Nobody went down, because before the war, since 1937, my brother send me over to the factory to get the fa-familiar with the procedures, how to deal with the people who worked in the factory, and how to deal with customers who buy -- bought our merchandise; to get familiar with it. But since -- when the Germans came in, this stopped, so my brother said, \u201cDon\u2019t mention any more, you stay home like anybody else.\u201d And take -- in 19 -- the end of \u201939, we had to go in to live in a ghetto. So we lived in the ghetto, and life got terrible expensive because Jewish people never got any rations, because rations for Gentiles -- they used to get the food cards every month, but didn\u2019t got. So the Black Market was very high. If you want buy a loaf of bread, you have to buy -- you have to pay 10 times the value, and so any other products. Well, life got to get very expensive until 1940. In 1940, they arrested the owner, Rochinsky was arrested for Gestapo, because he was more or less a intelligent person. They had been scared, the Germans didn\u2019t trust the more intelligent people. And he was taken in the 40\u2019s, to Auschwitz. After two, three weeks -- we didn\u2019t know much about the Auschwitz in 1940, but after two, three weeks, came a telegram that he\u2019s not any more alive, and his clothing was sent back to his widow. And my brother said -- we have been three brothers at home, and the oldest brother, he had already like a green band, instead had the white arm band with the Star of David, he used to have a green band with the Star of David. The green band meant actually that you are privileged. A Jew was not allowed to dry -- to ride the train, or go out after seven o\u2019clock from the ghetto, to be seen on a street. They had still curfew for Jews. And everywhere, wherever, you couldn\u2019t move freely, but if you had a green band, you could ride the train, you had been -- you could move freely, you could go out after seven o\u2019clock actually. And this was a -- of course, the German government required if you would supply some metal products, even scaret of metal. So many pounds, was -- I don\u2019t know exactly, they gave you a green band that you are privileged Jew, and you could go more or less freely, wherever you wanted. He saw it that my -- otherwise we have it -- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a -- forced to perform some labor for the city, otts -- clean cities, or whatever. I was assigned in a quarry, a stone quarry, actually, and was very -- pretty hard work, but it - in the evening, after eight hours, or 10 hours, I don\u2019t know exactly either, how many hours we worked, we could go home and spend with our family at home. This went on, but still my brother said that he going to see a very -- that I get a green band, too, that I will not have to go to the slave labor every day, to the quarry. True, he had some connections in a larger city with some Jewish, more or less, leaders from the Jewish community, and they had connection, they had been able to bribe Gestapo, and SS. Bribing, if you gave money or some products what they wanted it, you could get favors from them, and they did it. When my brother arranged the same way, he had to pay money for it, that I will be assigned, to start to be as -- to go every day to labor in the city, that my assignment will be to put in labor in the factory, to work in the factory, to perform labor, whatever it was [indecipherable]. At this time the factory was idle, because Mrs. Rochinsky, she was -- she had three girls, and she was not able to manage a factory, she didn\u2019t know it. Besides this, when the German came in, they right away, they froze all salaries. Practically anyplace where s -- they had [indecipherable] employees, they couldn\u2019t pay any higher wages than -- than pre-war wages. And this was a problem, because whatever they have to buy, food for themselves, even with rations, or you wanted to buy something better, was sayvay four or five times as much as pre-war, [indecipherable] nobody wanted the war. When I -- when I had the permission to go down perform my job in the factory, my brother set me up, that I should get in contact with the employers who used to work before the war, and tell them if they come to work, they will be able to earn three times, or four times as much as they earned b-before the war. And they should be -- come to work to do their job, and we will pay them real good. I started to organize, and this -- people started to come back, until I opened the factory and started to produce. But, it was a problem. You had to have books, because you never know when the German government going to come to check your books. So e -- we have been forced to have double bookkeeping. One set of book was actually what we did pay them. Same way we used to get -- we used write [indecipherable] what we sold to dealers, we sold mostly to Jewish merchants, and we gave them a bill, the price like before the war, and they paid us the same way, two, three times this amount. But the point was we still had to keep double bookkeeping, until one of those days, and this was apparently in \u00b041, one of the employee, he was not mad at me, he work over there a long time already, and he knows me, and he saw me before the warm I was in the factory involved. And he got a -- with a disagreement with the owner in -- in the place, and he went to Gestapo, and he told them that the factory actually belongs more to us than it belongs to her, it\u2019s a Jewish factory, and he told all kinds. For example, we used to have, when we finished merchandise before, we shipped it out to those merchants who bought our merchandise, we always had been afraid that someday the Gestapo will come, and they will confiscate everything. And where we used to keep finished merchandise, not far away from the factory 1n a village, and it used to be hidden aboll where we could always ship this merchandise, because we never know if -- when they will come to confiscate the factory. And he told the Gestapo everything, what is going on, that the merchandise 1s in a aboll in the next village. And finally, one day, like I said, must have been July or August, a policeman came to our home, and he said that I should come down to this jontamarie, where they had their headquarters. Normally, our town was a small town, we didn\u2019t had, actually, Gestapo, SS in our town, only jontamarie we had it. But once in -- every few weeks, two, three weeks, what I don\u2019t know exactly, they used to come in a larger town, SS, they -- if they had any complaints to take care cases, this when they come in to take care the -- of those business. And iva the policemens told me I am called to the jontamarie, to come down. And I remember, and I can remember it exactly like today. I looked at my mother, and I saw her face, and it didn\u2019t help me that I have to go down, but it help me the suffering in my mother, and so my father, too. I went down in a sleeveless shirt --"

            "answer": "-- actually. And so the -- everything -- whatever he mentioned it, he mentioned me as a -- you know, the double bookkeeping, and everything that I was involved. And so this why they called me. And I went down, it was a pretty warm day, and I came down Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection over there, and I was called in in a room, where I saw a very high officer. I couldn\u2019t tell his rank, I\u2019m not familiar, but he was a very high officer. And I looked, he had a stack of papers, maybe two, three inches high, and he start to ask me questions, if I am in the factory over there, if I help manage the factory. And right away I realized, when I saw this stack of papers, I realized what the questions are, that he knows more than I myself know, because of I realized that it\u2019s no use to lie, and I start to tell anything fully -- fully to cooperate with them. But this was not a big deal, cooperation did not help to save me. He called in two strong guys from the Gestapo. Young guys, strong guys. And they had like a special chair, like to lay down on it, not to sit, but -- on my belly to lay over there, that my back, everything is exposed. And they came in with -- the -- the SS and Gestapo, they used to carry, when they went on the street, made from leather -- I don\u2019t know even how they call this in English, I don\u2019t recall, exactly, whatever. You know, for beating somebody, just on the street. They saw a Jewish kid, or whatever, they beat over the head with it, something like this. And they told me to lay down on my belly on this chair, whatever it was, it was built special for this purpose, actually. And in both sides, right and left, kept on pounding in my body, actually. And actually, it\u2019s impossible. I was young, and strong at this time, maybe, but beating like this, I don\u2019t think any human can take it. And I used to pass out. When I passed out, they dragged me out to the well, they pumped water on my head. As soon I came back, they dragged me back in, and again and again and again. And I always was more on the floor anyway, especial with the beating, I couldn\u2019t stand straight any more. They didn\u2019t give you a chair to seat, and so you had a choice, all to be on your all four on the floor, or actually -- you know, to stay, you couldn\u2019t stay. I was always on the floor. I went -- he was sitting at the table, he had very polished, high boots on it, and I remember I practically was very -- pretty close to his boots. And I told him in German, \u201cPlease shoot me. Please finish me off.\u201d And he laughed, looked in my eyes, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this, but we finish you off when we want it, not when you want it.\u201d And this went on hours and hours.

And the reason was actually the synagogue was near a river what it went through our town, the Pilitsa. And it was a bridge, and the bridge actually was a wooden bridge. It was not a heavy structure, a wooden bridge. And when the Germans invaded, I remember it was on a Friday, the first of September was on a Friday when they c -- yeah, it was a Friday, and Saturday they have been already over there. And so the first thing what they did, they tried to secure the bridge, they -- they can come in and cross wherever they wanted with their armies. So they put the bridge on fire, after they went in, and this was near the synagogue, and because the structure was a wooden structure, apparently -- I don\u2019t know, maybe they put bombs -- firebombs actually on it before -- this 1 -- I don\u2019t know either, because I actually, myself, and so the -- mostly of the town, the whole town, run away in the woods. So we didn\u2019t know exactly, but we know it right away the next day, that the synagogue was burned. Actually, it was nothing left over from the synagogue.

Actually, it was the same town, but it still, this was Chadbush, and this was Vidamma. In the ghetto, when they had to leave everything, the houses, and anything, and go, the ghetto was actually made in Vidamma. The reason was because it was already a little bit out of the town, and it was easier to petition it off with wires, or whatever, to make it that you cannot just walk out of the ghetto as a free person. And this was the easiest thing, cause of the German decided that Vidamma wi -- will be the ghetto, and this actually where all Jews, including my family, lived. In Vidamma, in the ghetto."

So she was arrested, and I never knowed it -- that -- til he -- until four weeks later. But I -- I was -- first they put me in a jail in Chadbush.

A big jail is like jeminale, you know, but this was a small -- it was just for drunks, or whatever. Not too much, you know, criminals. And they hold me overnight. When I came to this jail, -- oh the first -- this was the first time in my life I came in a jail, but we used to hear stories, if you have been a newcomer in a jail, they made jokes with you, all kind, a lot of time even beating, or whatever. This was the fun -- this how -- it used to be a custom, and -- when you was a newcomer in a jail. When I came in over -- to this jail, actually, they probably realized I couldn\u2019t walk straight, and mine back, everything, was black practically. But for some reason, they didn\u2019t perform all those jokes, what they used to do it for a newcomer. And they felt more or less like sorry for me, you know, that I was all beaten up, so they let me alone. Little bit later on, came in the one who was like a policeman, he was in charge of this small jail. And he knowed my parents, or he knowed me, too. So he came over to me, he wa -- they was P-Poles, not a -- not Germans, but a Pole, and he came over, and he asked me if I want write home something to m -- to my parents about me. At first I hardly could even take a pencil, my hand to write any words, but I -- I said it\u2019s necessary to write home. And I wrote home in the same way I think on the ID cards what they distributed in the Holocaust museum, what I took part those -- they have this saying in sayvay things like this you cannot forget. I wrote home, and I said in my few words what I was writing, I told them please -- twice I said please, please forget about me, I be all right. Go on with your life, noble. Just forget about me. This was in Chadbush still. This was my last word to my parents and family. The next morning they took me -- they brought me -- it\u2019s just 40 kilometers from Chadbush, and the name is Koinsket. This is a larger town, and they had over there a -- a large -- a k -- prison -- a prison for the -- for -- mostly for people who don\u2019t obey the law, whatever, but it was much, much larger. I was brought in over there, first they took me to Gestapo in Koinsket, and I was real -- really concerned. I-I didn\u2019t care, I was afraid just for more beating, that I couldn\u2019t take it any more. So I -- every minute I was over there, I just kept on looking when they start -- going to start to beat me again, but they never did. They brought me over to the jail. When I came into the jail, I was released, that -- at least I wasn\u2019t beaten any more, I came in over there. And the same thing, I know the procedure again, that those all in jail gonna make -- have fun, whatever. And they saw me coming in, and the same way they felt sorry for me, and they know it that I\u2019m not a criminal, and they realize that -- why I am over there, because it was involved for politics too, because the bookkeeper from our factory used to always to give me a -- handle over some mimeographs that used to come from the underground, from the -- England, to tell you how the front goes on over there. And so he told them that I -- I have knowledge about the underground, too, was a -- this was part why I was arrested, actually. And they kept on coming, talking this over, how I behaved, and -- and I did whatever they told me. We have been in a cell, probably was over there the same way, between 30 and 40 people, and everybody has a -- like in a corner, in a straw sack he had over there where you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection rested overnight to sleep, actually. In the same way it was no modern facilities in this jail. We used to have a large can, real huge, and everybody -- what a human has to do it, or -- they did everything the whole night, in this large kettle -- can, whatever. And in the morning it was always they changed it. Two people, they used to carry out, and take care, and then was to sc-scrub the floors, to keep it clean, everything. I recall after a f-few days that -- certain the third day, the fourth day, it was -- I was 1n the line to carry this out, and scrub the floors, and so far. And I went over to do it, I didn\u2019t look that somebody should do for me any favors, I went over like any other prisoner. And then one Pole came, and pushed me away, and he said he will do this for me. I -- I didn\u2019t want to fight it, I let him do it. And the same way, after a few days, maybe after a week, the one who was in charge, like the warden in jail, he was not German, he was Polish, too. So he called me in his office, he came to me, I went down from that cell in his office. And he told me, \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, you probably -- your brothers are working for you that you going to be released. You will probably be -- be released 1f not this week, is next week, a third week. But they work for you, to release you.\u201d It meant that they going to bribe the Gestapo for it. And he says, \u201cI know -- they are in contact with me, and I will see that you get food. You don\u2019t have to eat that food from the jail. Somebody will bring in every day, food for you. And so you going to have private food, not from jail. But,\u201d he said, \u201cjust -- this 1s a secret.\u201d This is a very dangerous thing, I should never tell nobody what happened, what had happened. He will see that I will be supplied with food. And I noticed that actually that it changed a little bit, you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection know. I felt more comfortable, and so were all those other in the cell, the other person thas this -- they didn\u2019t know it, where I was exactly, but -- this was a secret when I called into the office, to this warden. But they saw something goes on, so I didn\u2019t say a word, but they felt that I am better treated like anybody else, more or less. And so they tried, actually, always, what I had to do, they jumped in, pushed me away, and they used to do it for me. And we got along fairly well. This was -- actually, in jail over there, in Koinsket, I was four weeks. I remember one day they brought in two Jewish people, because I was the only Jew on the -- in this cell. But they brought in a couple Jewish people, I know them. They have been in Vidamoff, in the ghetto, they lived in the ghetto. They used to be butcher -- butchers, and they got caught by the German authority that they butchered a cow, or whatever. They took them, they put them -- they brought them over to the jail. And I can recall normally they have not been so religious people, a butcher, whatever, but one had along with him a prayer book, and the whole night he didn\u2019t do nothing else, except he kept on praying from the prayer book. Prays -- was it -- to me it was not strange, 1t was familiar, everything. And I ask myself, he\u2019s not such hot religious person, why does he pray so much? What is happen, early in the morning, maybe five o\u2019clock, still was dark, they called off their name, they took them out, and we heard a few shots. The others in the cell told me, \u201cYou know, they got shot. They killed them.\u201d Over there, outside the jail. I didn\u2019t know now -- think I didn\u2019t know it, if they are dead, if it\u2019s true what they told me, but I know it -- it\u2019s fa -- was not just calling off a name. We heard shots."

And he say he doesn\u2019t want to stay in Poland, doesn\u2019t want no part, so he just -- and he was a patriot to build Israel, this was the reason. We thought he is not normal, he goes away from the -- from the good home, and he used to say he\u2019s ashamed that we are making money easy, you know, he believe more you have to work for your money, not just from business. So far -- he was very, very much patriotic, but the -- with me, actually, I didn\u2019t know it, I was over there four weeks in jail, and then suddenly, about -- after four weeks, I remember, yeah, somebody called my name. And I recognize right away this was the widow from the factory, Mrs. Rochinski, and she in Polish calls me, you know, and -- and so if she\u2019s -- and she -- I responded, \u201cYeah, I am here, in this cell.\u201d I don\u2019t know if- where she know it, or apparently she know it. And so she told me that she is released, she --after four weeks -- she was four weeks 1n jail, and she said she -- they released her, she goes home. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t worry, I will go home. They had already the release for me, but they need a signature from a higher officer, and they have to go to another town for this high office signature. \u201cSo you probably will be released tomorrow,\u201d she told me. And they all -- the other inmates in the cell where was -- I was with them, they all heard it, and everybody was happy for me, I going to go home tomorrow. And they gave me addresses to go to their families, and their wives, tell them how they are, what they this. It was a -- like a holiday already, the day when she called us. But the next morning, early in the morning, this what the procedure [indecipherable] in the morning, they called off my name, they called off other inmates name, but I -- something didn\u2019t sound to me right, because they kept on calling too many names. Because they used to do every few weeks, every month or two -- but I don\u2019t know the same way, exactly how often they did it. They emptied the jails for new inmates. In other word, they took those jails, and they send them to concentration camps, like Auschwitz or whatever, and -- but when they took us, they tied our -- our hand to the back, and -- just with a piece string, like, actually, nothing, and they put us on trucks, and they drove, I don\u2019t know how many kilometer -- I never know even til today where I was. I think -- I assume it was Kelsa, because from Koinsket, biz -- Kelsa was not so far, and took about a couple hours in a truck. And then they brought us to a market over there on the -- we have been told -- we saw all around SS, with machine guns, rifle gu -- whatever, circled around us, and they kept on bringing to another jail, so I don\u2019t know [indecipherable] else, until they get it, a large quantity of people the same way and it -- it must have been several thousand, actually. Took quite a number of hours, until when we all have been, and you have -- lay on the floor, on your knees, you could not raise your head, if you raised your head, your -- they told us, then you will be shot. You know, your -- right away they watched with rifles around over there, or machine gun. Well, we all laid on the -- on the f -- on the ground over there on this market, until actually they had the amount of people, or whate -- what they expected to have it on the jails, and they put us on cat -- those cattle wagons, in the same ways. We used to see the one who guarded some of them have been Wehrmarkt, and so we have been more friendlier, because you couldn\u2019t just talk to one from the SS, he finished you on -- off on the spot. But we saw [indecipherable] they ask him where they take us, where we going to go, where we going. \u201cOh,\u201d they used to say, \u201coh, you go probably where you going to have to | -- be over there, do some work, labor.\u201d [indecipherable] all, and we didn\u2019t know it until we arrived around midnight, probably, over there, and the first thing I saw it when they brought in, they opened the gate, and it said, the gate said abait bakt fry. And I didn\u2019t know that this was a g -- in Auschwitz a gate, didn\u2019t know it. But as soon we -- we got off in restraints, although it was guarded off -- they have a bi -- large ramp -- ramp, and both sides have been guarded by SS. And they had sticks, irons, all kind things, and when they chase you out, and everything was schnell, schnell, fast, fast. And so you got -- wherever you move, wherever you go, it didn\u2019t make any different. They hit you over your head, or your back. It depends how lucky you have been, and we had to keep on moving. And this what we did, and then we saw people, like kapos in uniforms, striped uniforms. We didn\u2019t know it -- they start to talk, and they said, \u201cHere\u2019s Auschwitz,\u201d you know? And some of them have been only over there from those kapos what they -- they want to kill you practically on the spot. Any move, whatever it was, it didn\u2019t make any different. It was only, you know, to make you so miserable, that you will give up li -- living. The truth 1s, I gave up right away the first day when I was arrested. I figured this is the end. And I could see it right away, wherever I was, that it\u2019s nowhere in the world -- you know, the dreaming that I will go home, see my parents, see my family, or be free. A lot of -- the first thing when I gave up, I figured what\u2019s the use to fight? You cannot fight this, and why suffer? So you -- no use to suffer either."

            "answer": "Yes. This was in 1945. Finally, I was -- the last dead march -- I -- I made more than one dead march, that was made in the end of December, between Christmas and New Year. The first dead march was from Auschwitz over Yaveeshavitz to Buchenwald. Then, from Buchenwald I\u2019d say where I was 1n a subcamp from Buchenwald, the name was Traylitz, this is near Leipzig. And around early April, or the end of March they say the -- the allied forces start to get closer. Well, the first thing, they put us for a recreation, too, they kept on. They kept us in two weeks what 1s -- you know, I don\u2019t want go into details, because y -- it -- I will never be able to even finish, even if you stay a whole week. It was -- I did survive the dead march. They kept us on trains, we used to go in the woods for a day. I just found out later that they used to, every day, from one place to the other place was maybe 10 - 15 kilometers, th-the -- they have been -- our train was on a one track line. We didn\u2019t go nowhere, we just went from one place, and the next day we went back to the other place. And we thought -- we didn\u2019t realize that this is the same place, we didn\u2019t go nowhere. And I have been, for two weeks -- not me only, but all of us who survive what actually -- in a few thousand they started off when they evacuate us, until to the end, maybe was 50 - 60 left. In thousands, the all other been on the -- on the roads and the ditches, their bodies was laying because they have been shot, they have been exhausted from walking, whatever, and automatically, if you couldn\u2019t walk, automatically the guard shot you. Doesn\u2019t make any difference. But I survived over there. So the last thing, I arrived in Theresienstadt. And this was -- the same way, you know, I -- I -- must be early of April. And at this time, when I arrived in Theresienstadt actually, I was probably 99 percent point nine dead, actually. I have very little signs that I\u2019m alive, actually. And in fact, it was in -- a coincidence that -- even that I reached Theresienstadt, because in Litenritz, one night, when they -- those all who -- who still have been alive, they brought us first the night before -- we have been in I think the camp called Litenritz, and this was terrible condi -- conditions. And being two weeks without food, without water, even the little food what we used to get, but without this [indecipherable] it didn\u2019t -- we have not been far away in 100 percent to be dead. And what had happened in this Litenritz actually, that they said in the morning they going to serve us coffee, a hot, liquid something, whatever. And over there the barracks didn\u2019t had even floors, and laying in mud, you didn\u2019t had no bunkbeds, nothing. If you laid down for the night to rest, or to sleep, how you call it, you laid in the mud. But nothing to -- less, and nothing more but in the mud. And this was a terrible things, without everything, but a human, if you have anything, any instinct being a human, you know that this doesn\u2019t go farther. I didn\u2019t slept even the whole night, but probably I would have been fall asleep, and waited actually that I\u2019m going to get -- I know it would be a little bit dark, mud, whatever they called it, they called it coffee, but we get it. And we used to carry always a can, a rusted can if they found it, if somebody going to give us something, that we have a can to take the food. And early in the morning, they called you, coffee. And I was trying to be from the first, because I know it if I don\u2019t go to the first, I will never reach any more what they gave you. I was among the first, and they gave me the amount what -- in my rusted coffee, and I just pour it in -- in my body, whatever they gave it to me. I -- I don\u2019t know til today what it was. I just poured it in. And took a few hours, and they told us that the guards will come, they will take us to the next camp. We heard about Theresienstadt, we know that Theresienstadt is not actually a concentration camp, it\u2019s a model camp. We -- we had not been afraid, we cannot go -- we cannot lose now, see, it cannot be worse than it is. And we have been happy that finally -- that we will -- we will reach Theresienstadt, but not always what you think is happening. For some reason, after this, I got diarrhea, and this was outside, actually, I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think they even had toilets in this camp, wherever. And I -- I was dehydrated, I could tell, I mean, I didn\u2019t had it before because I was two weeks without food, without water. I was fairly dehydrated and I couldn\u2019t get up. My friends, what we -- I know them from Auschwitz still, they came by and they said good news, [indecipherable] you know, we going to come to Theresienstadt in the next hour or two. And I told the one that I know them very well, w-was intimate friendship in Auschwitz, in Yaveeshavitz. His name was Yankey. And I told him, \u201cYankila, it\u2019s too late for me.\u201d And he said, \u201cIn the all suffering what you know what you had in Auschwitz, in the coal mine, and everything,\u201d he said -- he said, \u201cdon\u2019t make me leave you here.\u201d And they actually risked their lives, two of them, and they practically carried me in to Theresienstadt. But still I never had any hope that I will be able to walk, or for freedom. I realized it\u2019s too late even to have any hope. [indecipherable] show it, actually, when we came to Theresienstadt we look like animals, we act like animals. Those who still could walk were -- whatever they start to give us some rations, some of them who have been stronger, they used to see that -- used to pass by wagons that went to the kitchen for the supplies, and they used to highjack those wagons and steal everything out, bread, or potatoes, or whatever they have over there. And those people from Theresienstadt, those inmates, they have been scared of us like wild animals, and it\u2019s not just [indecipherable], we have been. We look like animals [indecipherable] but after they too start to get help more or less, that some ladies, nurses came in, and they start to clean us up, because I still had the same clothing, the same shirt, or whatever, when I left Auschwitz, this was the end of -- of December. And I never had another -- never changed nothing, and this was already practically the end of April, where they took everything what we took off they burned it on the spot, and they gave us some clothing, more or less. And they bathed us, and shaved us. I mean, they cleaned us up, they disinfect us, more or less. And then we heard it already, that bring in in Switzerland, in Schwietz, they used to send food o-over to Theresienstadt. Not only food, [indecipherable] the best food, you know, white bread, and cheeses, and -- and ham, sausage, oh, the best from the best practically. But people- people kept on dying like flies, actually. When they start to eat, this was the end of it. | actually, the beginning, I -- I felt that I ate, and I could take food, and I got -- felt that every day I\u2019d get stronger and feel better. And for some reason too, I don\u2019t know why, they picked me over there in Theresienstadt to be in charge of the food supply. To give out, to see how many rations to prepare were there -- for the people who have been over there. There a certain amount of barracks, you know. One barrack was also - they called it a hospital, but the truth 1s 1t was like a dump. It was a matter, you know, they put you in, you couldn\u2019t walk any more, they put you in in the bed. They know it, not in a matter of a day, but in an hour, you will be dead, so they throw you out, and they put in another body in the bed. And so went on -- actually 99 percent all died, actually. Was no doctors, no nurses, and -- and I could feel that I get better and everything, but suddenly, I don\u2019t know what went bad, or what went wrong, or maybe because I was in close contact, I used -- I had to go in in this barrack every day and count people who have been still alive. And the -- to know, you know, we need for this hospi -- the hospital, they called it a hospital. We need 50 rations, 60 rations. I used to, you know, the dead have been on the g -- floor already, on the ground, I don\u2019t know even if it was a floor over there. On the ground, and the living -- so I count the living so there\u2019s how many rations to prepare. And I don\u2019t know, in a matter of in a week or two, I just caught something like a th -- a disease, but I -- I cannot explain it, I don\u2019t know, and I will not know even, what had happened. For some reason, if it\u2019s good food, whatever it was over there, and I could have as much as I desire and everything. It was in a certain day, was like my mole was sealed off everything. I couldn\u2019t take it, I couldn\u2019t look it. I used to go ahead, and take a nice roll, white roll, and put down all kind cheeses and sausage, whatever. And I told them -- this was -- not far away was a park over there, I says I going to sit on the bench in the park, and I will get an appetite, eventually, I believe. Nothing helped. So I start to go right away, backwards, and it doesn\u2019t take long. Whatever I gained, I lost much, much quicker than it took me to gain. And I couldn\u2019t walk any more either. And [indecipherable] say well, you have -- said you -- you go to the hospital. I know it, what it is, but it was not -- it didn\u2019t matter to me, it was no difference. I realized whatever it is, it\u2019s too late for me. I went to the hospital, as I mentioned. It was no nurse, it was no doctor, I mean nothing. I just laid, the same way, waiting, until they dump me out right there on the floor with the dead. Why and what [indecipherable] behind my understanding, and how to tell, how to explain, I did got over it. I did survive."

And I never dreamed that I will -- we will be able to afford to contribute, but thanks God we did contribute hundred thousand dollars to the Holocaust museum.

When I was liberated in Theresienstadt, this was probably the end of April, or beginning of May, in *45, and I was so sick and ill actually, what I never expect to be alive, and I never saw a doctor, whatever, to check me if I\u2019m healthy or I\u2019m sick, until I came to Prague, Czechoslovakia where they accepted me in a sanitortum. This was the first time a doctor examined me and check whatever they -- the sanitorium over there, the management, they strictly took in only DP\u2019s, Displaced Persons who had been in a concentration camp. And they treated us -- royalty is maybe the proper word to say. And the first medical doctor, he examined me, and he examined me, he told me that I have an enlarged heart. Even without knowing any medical terms, or whatever, I don\u2019t know, I just happened to be that I asked this doctor, \u201cWill this stay with me forever?\u201d And he said in medical terms, it\u2019s hard to tell. Sometime, if you live a normal life, it goes back to normality, it will disappear, and a lot of times it\u2019s will stay with you your whole life. So far, thanks God, I felt if I worked physical, it helps me to stay alive, more or less. So I continually -- my doctor told me that fairly I\u2019m in good shape, and whatever you do, he told me not to change the formula, keep on doing the same thing. And well, I\u2019m doing it."

Would you talk a little bit about that?",
            "answer": "I can talk as much as possible for me. I mean, those things you don\u2019t forget actually. I was actually, when I came to Auschwitz at this time, being Jewish was 100 5 percent impossible to s -- to live a day or two. Gentiles who come to Auschwitz in \u201941, a maximum, I would say, you know, you could live a day or two, and because the horrors were so great, was impossible. But in my case, actually, in fact this is actually why I survived; I was in Auschwitz only -- direct in Auschwitz, I was only one day. The second day the Germans needed real bad -- around Auschwitz 1s a lot of coal mines, and they needed real bad people to go to the mines, but they didn\u2019t trust Poles, who came to -- to Auschwitz actually, because you have to work with Poles, civilian Poles in the mine, they smuggle you out, or whatever, so they never took Poles to the mine. The only who they took to the mines was Jewish, or Germans -- not Jew -- Germans we -- we were -- who have been the same way, have been prisoners in the camps. And the second day, actually, the same eight people who wa -- we have been stepped out being Jewish, we have been called again to be on the appelleplatz. And we came back, and a doctor came in Auschwitz, and we have been in Auschwitz, a doctor came and told us to take off our clothing, and everything, and examined us, our health, our -- and then he said, \u201cYou going to be sent to Yavishavitz,\u201d and Yavishavitz was a coal mine camp. And this was a brand new camp, and at this time when we went to Yavishavitz, we couldn\u2019t believe it that we are in Auschwitz. Even Yavishavitz was a subcamp of Auschwitz. But it was no kapos, we have not been mistreated too bad. And the director from the coal mine came, and he spoke to us, and he says he\u2019s only interested in one thing, this 1s to be good workers in the mine. And he promised us if we will behave, we will do good work in the mine, he will look into it that we are not Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection mistreated, and we will be getting proper food. We\u2019ll be able -- I was night shift, and he said, we -- you'll be able to sleep during the day. And in the beginning, was actually true everything, it was not so terrible, I mean, you could survive. The only thing was the hard work in the mine, but I used to talk to the one that was in charge in the mine, he was a Pole, and I used to ask him how long can you live in the mine? He said, \u201cOh, people work here 20 and 25 years.\u201d And he told me you can survive you working in the mines. And he showed me how to hold the shovel proper, what is actually -- make it much easier to work on it. And it was good until actually, til \u00b042, when they start with Jewish transport. And then when they start with Jewish transport, they had so many people -- Jewish people, actually, and the most highly intelligent people fen Germany, French, Poland, Belgium, Italy. They come, they\u2019ve been professional doctors, professors, very high tech people, and they send them in the mine, they last a day or two, this was all. And they looked only a way how to dispose people. They didn\u2019t look any more for workers, because they had too many of them. In the camp when I came to Yavishavitz was maybe 300 people. When the Jewish transport come, the -- in the same camp, in the same barracks, they had 3000. And actually every week, used to come a truck in the crematoriums in Auschwitz, and picked up those who broke down. It didn\u2019t took too long, actually for people, highly intelligent people to break down. I don\u2019t know even it took a week, took days. They all got to the point of not being able any more to work, and -- and the rule of the camp, especially in Auschwitz was, if you are not able to work, you don\u2019t have a right to live, and so you -- they automatically -- you know it, if you cannot work, you go to the crematoriums."

They gave you a bed, you know, to sleep in, and they gave you always a slip, across the street was a restaurant where they gave you a slip for breakfast, or dinner, supper, whatever. Oh, this 1s all right, I mean, I didn\u2019t feel nothing wrong in -- you know, about this. I mean, it was great. I went over there overnight, and in the morning, I didn\u2019t know Stuttgart, but I went down in the center of the Stuttgart, and looked around.

They ask me the story where I was, I told them, you know, in Auschwitz I worked in a coal mine, and I just come from Prague where I was in a sanitorium, and I -- somebody brought me to Stuttgart. Well, they told me, oh -- he says -- yeah, this what they told me first, they ask me where I stay. I told them the Yakob Shula. They say, \u201cOh, Jewish people don\u2019t stay in the Yakob Shula.\u201d This is maybe for Germans, other nationality, not Jewish people."
