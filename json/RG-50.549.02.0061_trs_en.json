We had business, all kind of bus -- my parents started actually, with a grocery store, good business. But when my mo -- my oldest brother, Haim, when he was more or less in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So he started it, he -- he was a representative -- in our town, small town in Chadbush was four smaller factories. They all produced the same product, more or less, like knives, forks. And the mostly of it, it was not expensive, it wasn\u2019t the most cheapest actually, tableware, what you can have it. And this used to be shipped to Galeetsia, farther down near the Russian border where we had it. And my brother used to supply raw materials, and apparently, I don\u2019t know exactly, but he made always so much percentage on the supplies profit. And this got better and better every time, with more -- and the season mostly in those factories, smaller fat -- f -- smaller factories was about four or five months of the year, where business were real good, and about six, seven months were slack. And they had a rough time to meet payrolls for the workers what they kept on. And my buth -- my brother used to borrow money, actually to those factories, not for a favor, but actually to make some money, too. So they paid so much percentage per month, or whatever, I was not familiar, I was too young to know about business. Then finally he invested in one particular factory, it belongs to a Gentile in out town, his name was Rochinsky. And he had a little bit rough time to repay it, whatever he owed us, So he took -- he proposed my brother to be a partner in the factory. And this went on til war time [indecipherable]. In 1939, when the Germans came in, my brother realized it\u2019s another -- a different era already. We -- as being well and everything, but This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection we realized that we shouldn\u2019t show that we had any interest in the factory, because we know it, that Jewish property was confiscated right from the beginning. Nobody went down, because before the war, since 1937, my brother send me over to the factory to get the fa-familiar with the procedures, how to deal with the people who worked in the factory, and how to deal with customers who buy -- bought our merchandise; to get familiar with it. But since -- when the Germans came in, this stopped, so my brother said, \u201cDon\u2019t mention any more, you stay home like anybody else.\u201d And take -- in 19 -- the end of \u201939, we had to go in to live in a ghetto. So we lived in the ghetto, and life got terrible expensive because Jewish people never got any rations, because rations for Gentiles -- they used to get the food cards every month, but didn\u2019t got. So the Black Market was very high. If you want buy a loaf of bread, you have to buy -- you have to pay 10 times the value, and so any other products. Well, life got to get very expensive until 1940. In 1940, they arrested the owner, Rochinsky was arrested for Gestapo, because he was more or less a intelligent person. They had been scared, the Germans didn\u2019t trust the more intelligent people. And he was taken in the 40\u2019s, to Auschwitz. After two, three weeks -- we didn\u2019t know much about the Auschwitz in 1940, but after two, three weeks, came a telegram that he\u2019s not any more alive, and his clothing was sent back to his widow. And my brother said -- we have been three brothers at home, and the oldest brother, he had already like a green band, instead had the white arm band with the Star of David, he used to have a green band with the Star of David. The green band meant actually that you are privileged. A Jew was not allowed to dry -- to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They had still curfew for Jews. And everywhere, wherever, you couldn\u2019t move freely, but if you had a green band, you could ride the train, you had been -- you could move freely, you could go out after seven o\u2019clock actually. And this was a -- of course, the German government required if you would supply some metal products, even scaret of metal. So many pounds, was -- I don\u2019t know exactly, they gave you a green band that you are privileged Jew, and you could go more or less freely, wherever you wanted. He saw it that my -- otherwise we have it -- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a -- forced to perform some labor for the city, otts -- clean cities, or whatever. I was assigned in a quarry, a stone quarry, actually, and was very -- pretty hard work, but it - in the evening, after eight hours, or 10 hours, I don\u2019t know exactly either, how many hours we worked, we could go home and spend with our family at home. This went on, but still my brother said that he going to see a very -- that I get a green band, too, that I will not have to go to the slave labor every day, to the quarry. True, he had some connections in a larger city with some Jewish, more or less, leaders from the Jewish community, and they had connection, they had been able to bribe Gestapo, and SS. Bribing, if you gave money or some products what they wanted it, you could get favors from them, and they did it. When my brother arranged the same way, he had to pay money for it, that I will be assigned, to start to be as -- to go every day to labor in the city, that my assignment will be to put in labor in the factory, to work in the factory, to perform labor, whatever it was [indecipherable]. At this time the factory This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was idle, because Mrs. Rochinsky, she was -- she had three girls, and she was not able to manage a factory, she didn\u2019t know it. Besides this, when the German came in, they right away, they froze all salaries. Practically anyplace where s -- they had [indecipherable] employees, they couldn\u2019t pay any higher wages than -- than pre-war wages. And this was a problem, because whatever they have to buy, food for themselves, even with rations, or you wanted to buy something better, was sayvay four or five times as much as pre-war, [indecipherable] nobody wanted the war. When I -- when I had the permission to go down perform my job in the factory, my brother set me up, that I should get in contact with the employers who used to work before the war, and tell them if they come to work, they will be able to earn three times, or four times as much as they earned b-before the war. And they should be -- come to work to do their job, and we will pay them real good. I started to organize, and this -- people started to come back, until I opened the factory and started to produce. But, it was a problem. You had to have books, because you never know when the German government going to come to check your books. So e -- we have been forced to have double bookkeeping. One set of book was actually what we did pay them. Same way we used to get -- we used write [indecipherable] what we sold to dealers, we sold mostly to Jewish merchants, and we gave them a bill, the price like before the war, and they paid us the same way, two, three times this amount. But the point was we still had to keep double bookkeeping, until one of those days, and this was apparently in \u00b041, one of the employee, he was not mad at me, he work over there a long time already, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and he knows me, and he saw me before the warm I was in the factory involved. And he got a -- with a disagreement with the owner in -- in the place, and he went to Gestapo, and he told them that the factory actually belongs more to us than it belongs to her, it\u2019s a Jewish factory, and he told all kinds. For example, we used to have, when we finished merchandise before, we shipped it out to those merchants who bought our merchandise, we always had been afraid that someday the Gestapo will come, and they will confiscate everything. And where we used to keep finished merchandise, not far away from the factory 1n a village, and it used to be hidden aboll where we could always ship this merchandise, because we never know if -- when they will come to confiscate the factory. And he told the Gestapo everything, what is going on, that the merchandise 1s in a aboll in the next village. And finally, one day, like I said, must have been July or August, a policeman came to our home, and he said that I should come down to this jontamarie, where they had their headquarters. Normally, our town was a small town, we didn\u2019t had, actually, Gestapo, SS in our town, only jontamarie we had it. But once in -- every few weeks, two, three weeks, what I don\u2019t know exactly, they used to come in a larger town, SS, they -- if they had any complaints to take care cases, this when they come in to take care the -- of those business. And iva the policemens told me I am called to the jontamarie, to come down. And I remember, and I can remember it exactly like today. I looked at my mother, and I saw her face, and it didn\u2019t help me that I have to go down, but it help me the suffering in my mother, and so my father, too. I went down in a sleeveless shirt -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I couldn\u2019t tell his rank, I\u2019m not familiar, but he was a very high officer. And I looked, he had a stack of papers, maybe two, three inches high, and he start to ask me questions, if I am in the factory over there, if I help manage the factory.

On one side of the river -- of the Pilitsa, where the bridge was, was the one side was Chadbush, when you crossed the bridge, they called it Vidamma. Actually, it was the same town, but it still, this was Chadbush, and this was Vidamma. In the ghetto, when they had to leave everything, the houses, and anything, and go, the ghetto was actually made in Vidamma. The reason was because it was already a little bit out of the town, and it was easier to petition it off with wires, or whatever, to make it that you cannot just walk out of the ghetto as a free person. And this was the easiest thing, cause of the German decided that Vidamma wi -- will be the ghetto, and this actually where all Jews, including my family, lived. In Vidamma, in the ghetto."

So she was arrested, and I never knowed it -- that -- til he -- until four weeks later. But I -- I was -- first they put me in a jail in Chadbush. And This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

A big jail is like jeminale, you know, but this was a small -- it was just for drunks, or whatever. Not too much, you know, criminals. And they hold me overnight. When I came to this jail, -- oh the first -- this was the first time in my life I came in a jail, but we used to hear stories, if you have been a newcomer in a jail, they made jokes with you, all kind, a lot of time even beating, or whatever. This was the fun -- this how -- it used to be a custom, and -- when you was a newcomer in a jail. When I came in over -- to this jail, actually, they probably realized I couldn\u2019t walk straight, and mine back, everything, was black practically. But for some reason, they didn\u2019t perform all those jokes, what they used to do it for a newcomer. And they felt more or less like sorry for me, you know, that I was all beaten up, so they let me alone. Little bit later on, came in the one who was like a policeman, he was in charge of this small jail. And he knowed my parents, or he knowed me, too. So he came over to me, he wa -- they was P-Poles, not a -- not Germans, but a Pole, and he came over, and he asked me if I want write home something to m -- to my parents about me. At first I hardly could even take a pencil, my hand to write any words, but I -- I said it\u2019s necessary to write home. And I wrote home in the same way I think on the ID cards what they distributed in the Holocaust museum, what I took part those -- they have this saying in sayvay things like this you cannot forget. I wrote home, and I said in my few words what I was writing, I told them please -- twice I said please, please forget about me, I be all right.

Just forget about me. This was in Chadbush still. This was my last word to my parents and family. The next morning they took me -- they brought me -- it\u2019s just 40 kilometers from Chadbush, and the name is Koinsket. This is a larger town, and they had over there a -- a large -- a k -- prison -- a prison for the -- for -- mostly for people who don\u2019t obey the law, whatever, but it was much, much larger. I was brought in over there, first they took me to Gestapo in Koinsket, and I was real -- really concerned. I-I didn\u2019t care, I was afraid just for more beating, that I couldn\u2019t take it any more. So I -- every minute I was over there, I just kept on looking when they start -- going to start to beat me again, but they never did. They brought me over to the jail. When I came into the jail, I was released, that -- at least I wasn\u2019t beaten any more, I came in over there. And the same thing, I know the procedure again, that those all in jail gonna make -- have fun, whatever. And they saw me coming in, and the same way they felt sorry for me, and they know it that I\u2019m not a criminal, and they realize that -- why I am over there, because it was involved for politics too, because the bookkeeper from our factory used to always to give me a -- handle over some mimeographs that used to come from the underground, from the -- England, to tell you how the front goes on over there. And so he told them that I -- I have knowledge about the underground, too, was a -- this was part why I was arrested, actually. And they kept on coming, talking this over, how I behaved, and -- and I did whatever they told me. We have been in a cell, probably was over there the same way, between 30 and 40 people, and everybody has a -- like in a corner, in a straw sack he had over there where you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

In the same way it was no modern facilities in this jail. We used to have a large can, real huge, and everybody -- what a human has to do it, or -- they did everything the whole night, in this large kettle -- can, whatever. And in the morning it was always they changed it. Two people, they used to carry out, and take care, and then was to sc-scrub the floors, to keep it clean, everything. I recall after a f-few days that -- certain the third day, the fourth day, it was -- I was 1n the line to carry this out, and scrub the floors, and so far. And I went over to do it, I didn\u2019t look that somebody should do for me any favors, I went over like any other prisoner. And then one Pole came, and pushed me away, and he said he will do this for me. I -- I didn\u2019t want to fight it, I let him do it. And the same way, after a few days, maybe after a week, the one who was in charge, like the warden in jail, he was not German, he was Polish, too. So he called me in his office, he came to me, I went down from that cell in his office. And he told me, \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, you probably -- your brothers are working for you that you going to be released. You will probably be -- be released 1f not this week, is next week, a third week. But they work for you, to release you.\u201d It meant that they going to bribe the Gestapo for it. And he says, \u201cI know -- they are in contact with me, and I will see that you get food. You don\u2019t have to eat that food from the jail. Somebody will bring in every day, food for you. And so you going to have private food, not from jail. But,\u201d he said, \u201cjust -- this 1s a secret.\u201d This is a very dangerous thing, I should never tell nobody what happened, what had happened. He will see that I will be supplied with food.

I felt more comfortable, and so were all those other in the cell, the other person thas this -- they didn\u2019t know it, where I was exactly, but -- this was a secret when I called into the office, to this warden. But they saw something goes on, so I didn\u2019t say a word, but they felt that I am better treated like anybody else, more or less. And so they tried, actually, always, what I had to do, they jumped in, pushed me away, and they used to do it for me. And we got along fairly well. This was -- actually, in jail over there, in Koinsket, I was four weeks. I remember one day they brought in two Jewish people, because I was the only Jew on the -- in this cell. But they brought in a couple Jewish people, I know them. They have been in Vidamoff, in the ghetto, they lived in the ghetto. They used to be butcher -- butchers, and they got caught by the German authority that they butchered a cow, or whatever. They took them, they put them -- they brought them over to the jail. And I can recall normally they have not been so religious people, a butcher, whatever, but one had along with him a prayer book, and the whole night he didn\u2019t do nothing else, except he kept on praying from the prayer book. Prays -- was it -- to me it was not strange, 1t was familiar, everything. And I ask myself, he\u2019s not such hot religious person, why does he pray so much? What is happen, early in the morning, maybe five o\u2019clock, still was dark, they called off their name, they took them out, and we heard a few shots. The others in the cell told me, \u201cYou know, they got shot. They killed them.\u201d Over there, outside the jail. I didn\u2019t know now -- think I didn\u2019t know it, if they are dead, if it\u2019s true what they told me, but I know it -- it\u2019s fa -- was not just calling off a name. We heard shots.

The first dead march was from Auschwitz over Yaveeshavitz to Buchenwald. Then, from Buchenwald I\u2019d say where I was 1n a subcamp from Buchenwald, the name was Traylitz, this is near Leipzig. And around early April, or the end of March they say the -- the allied forces start to get closer. Well, the first thing, they put us for a recreation, too, they kept on. They kept us in two weeks what 1s -- you know, I don\u2019t want go into details, because y -- it -- I will never be able to even finish, even if you stay a whole week. It was -- I did survive the dead march. They kept us on trains, we used to go in the woods for a day. I just found out later that they used to, every day, from one place to the other place was maybe 10 - 15 kilometers, th-the -- they have been -- our train was on a one track line. We didn\u2019t go nowhere, we just went from one place, and the next day we went back to the other place. And we thought -- we didn\u2019t realize that this is the same place, we didn\u2019t go nowhere. And I have been, for two weeks -- not me only, but all of us who survive what actually -- in a few thousand they started off when they evacuate us, until to the end, maybe was 50 - 60 left.

Doesn\u2019t make any difference. But I survived over there. So the last thing, I arrived in Theresienstadt. And this was -- the same way, you know, I -- I -- must be early of April. And at this time, when I arrived in Theresienstadt actually, I was probably 99 percent point nine dead, actually. I have very little signs that I\u2019m alive, actually. And in fact, it was in -- a coincidence that -- even that I reached Theresienstadt, because in Litenritz, one night, when they -- those all who -- who still have been alive, they brought us first the night before -- we have been in I think the camp called Litenritz, and this was terrible condi -- conditions. And being two weeks without food, without water, even the little food what we used to get, but without this [indecipherable] it didn\u2019t -- we have not been far away in 100 percent to be dead. And what had happened in this Litenritz actually, that they said in the morning they going to serve us coffee, a hot, liquid something, whatever. And over there the barracks didn\u2019t had even floors, and laying in mud, you didn\u2019t had no bunkbeds, nothing. If you laid down for the night to rest, or to sleep, how you call it, you laid in the mud. But nothing to -- less, and nothing more but in the mud. And this was a terrible things, without everything, but a human, if you have anything, any instinct being a human, you know that this doesn\u2019t go farther. I didn\u2019t slept even the whole night, but probably I would have been fall asleep, and waited actually that I\u2019m going to get -- I know it would be a little bit dark, mud, whatever they called it, they called it coffee, but we get it.

And early in the morning, they called you, coffee. And I was trying to be from the first, because I know it if I don\u2019t go to the first, I will never reach any more what they gave you. I was among the first, and they gave me the amount what -- in my rusted coffee, and I just pour it in -- in my body, whatever they gave it to me. I -- I don\u2019t know til today what it was. I just poured it in. And took a few hours, and they told us that the guards will come, they will take us to the next camp. We heard about Theresienstadt, we know that Theresienstadt is not actually a concentration camp, it\u2019s a model camp. We -- we had not been afraid, we cannot go -- we cannot lose now, see, it cannot be worse than it is. And we have been happy that finally -- that we will -- we will reach Theresienstadt, but not always what you think is happening. For some reason, after this, I got diarrhea, and this was outside, actually, I didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think they even had toilets in this camp, wherever. And I -- I was dehydrated, I could tell, I mean, I didn\u2019t had it before because I was two weeks without food, without water. I was fairly dehydrated and I couldn\u2019t get up. My friends, what we -- I know them from Auschwitz still, they came by and they said good news, [indecipherable] you know, we going to come to Theresienstadt in the next hour or two. And I told the one that I know them very well, w-was intimate friendship in Auschwitz, in Yaveeshavitz. His name was Yankey. And I told him, \u201cYankila, it\u2019s too late for me.\u201d And he said, \u201cIn the all suffering what you know what you had in Auschwitz, in the coal mine, and everything,\u201d he said -- he said, \u201cdon\u2019t make me leave This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But still I never had any hope that I will be able to walk, or for freedom. I realized it\u2019s too late even to have any hope. [indecipherable] show it, actually, when we came to Theresienstadt we look like animals, we act like animals. Those who still could walk were -- whatever they start to give us some rations, some of them who have been stronger, they used to see that -- used to pass by wagons that went to the kitchen for the supplies, and they used to highjack those wagons and steal everything out, bread, or potatoes, or whatever they have over there. And those people from Theresienstadt, those inmates, they have been scared of us like wild animals, and it\u2019s not just [indecipherable], we have been. We look like animals [indecipherable] but after they too start to get help more or less, that some ladies, nurses came in, and they start to clean us up, because I still had the same clothing, the same shirt, or whatever, when I left Auschwitz, this was the end of -- of December. And I never had another -- never changed nothing, and this was already practically the end of April, where they took everything what we took off they burned it on the spot, and they gave us some clothing, more or less. And they bathed us, and shaved us. I mean, they cleaned us up, they disinfect us, more or less. And then we heard it already, that bring in in Switzerland, in Schwietz, they used to send food o-over to Theresienstadt. Not only food, [indecipherable] the best food, you know, white bread, and cheeses, and -- and ham, sausage, oh, the best from the best practically.

And for some reason too, I don\u2019t know why, they picked me over there in Theresienstadt to be in charge of the food supply. To give out, to see how many rations to prepare were there -- for the people who have been over there. There a certain amount of barracks, you know. One barrack was also - they called it a hospital, but the truth 1s 1t was like a dump. It was a matter, you know, they put you in, you couldn\u2019t walk any more, they put you in in the bed. They know it, not in a matter of a day, but in an hour, you will be dead, so they throw you out, and they put in another body in the bed. And so went on -- actually 99 percent all died, actually. Was no doctors, no nurses, and -- and I could feel that I get better and everything, but suddenly, I don\u2019t know what went bad, or what went wrong, or maybe because I was in close contact, I used -- I had to go in in this barrack every day and count people who have been still alive. And the -- to know, you know, we need for this hospi -- the hospital, they called it a hospital. We need 50 rations, 60 rations. I used to, you know, the dead have been on the g -- floor already, on the ground, I don\u2019t know even if it was a floor over there. On the ground, and the living -- so I count the living so there\u2019s how many rations to prepare. And I don\u2019t know, in a matter of in a week or two, I just caught something like a th -- a disease, but I -- I cannot explain it, I don\u2019t know, and I will not know even, what had happened. For some reason, if it\u2019s good food, whatever it was over there, and I could have as much as I desire and everything. It was in a certain day, was like my mole was sealed off everything.

And I told them -- this was -- not far away was a park over there, I says I going to sit on the bench in the park, and I will get an appetite, eventually, I believe. Nothing helped. So I start to go right away, backwards, and it doesn\u2019t take long. Whatever I gained, I lost much, much quicker than it took me to gain. And I couldn\u2019t walk any more either. And [indecipherable] say well, you have -- said you -- you go to the hospital. I know it, what it is, but it was not -- it didn\u2019t matter to me, it was no difference. I realized whatever it is, it\u2019s too late for me. I went to the hospital, as I mentioned. It was no nurse, it was no doctor, I mean nothing. I just laid, the same way, waiting, until they dump me out right there on the floor with the dead.
