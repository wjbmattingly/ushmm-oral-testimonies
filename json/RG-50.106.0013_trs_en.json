And stewardesses at that time had to be nurses, so I remember I had a --had an interview set up at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, and it was a --really looking forward to it, and then people from my hospital started going into the Services, mostly Army, and got very exciting about that time, and I decided that's what I wanted to do, so that's what I did.

            "answer": "Went to San Antonio, Texas. And--oh, so--what did I do. Signed up--this was all done by mail because then in Arkansas, now, it's all going through--I really don't know where. So I--I did sign up and received a commission through the mail. The funniest thing was I didn't know I had a commission. This is all just very strange to me, and I thought I'd got it when I--I thought I would get it when I reached San Antonio for basic training, but actually I had it the minute that I received the assignment, and it was strange \u2018cause I was on the train --we all had to stand up on a train. There were no seats. The trains were so full and there was a chaplain and a--and an enlisted man and I sharing one seat. The chaplain got it when he got on. He was very kind. And he said we'll all--it was about eight hours from my home to San Antonio. He said, \"We'll share this seat\" so we -- we actually \u2014have to stand until it's our turn to sit in that one seat and --so as we were talking, they told me --this chaplain and this enlisted man had been in for awhile said, \"You're already a second lieutenant.\" I thought that was very interesting. Anyhow --and they thought I was pretty naive so went on down to San Antonio and took basic training there, and I can't remember how much later but not long after that had orders for Camp Swift, Texas, with the 121st Semi-Mobile Evacuation Hospital was --I can't remember the word for that\u2014 activating. Was activating. So the doctors and nurses and corpsmen from --and administrative people from around the nation and--I think it's probably primarily up here in the --in the East were gathering at San Antonio to activate this tent hospital, and from there we went to New York. After we were activated as a hospital, all of us were there, we went to New York by train. Everything's by train in those days, and stayed there a few days, and then at night --well, no, there had to be as much secrecy as possible then because we were going by ship to England, and they still had the U-boats, the Germans had U-boats in the Atlantic, so went by ship to England, and we had no idea where we were going, but I remember going onto the ship and the blackout, complete blackout, and you --suddenly you were on the ship. It's almost as if you didn't really know you were boarding the ship; but there we were, and I think we left, maybe sailed the next morning and took us five days to get to England, and we were in England and -- and that --I believe we were waiting for the --when was D-Day? Do you remember what day that was? I think we were waiting for --no, I guess it was the Battle of The Bulge or something. We were waiting for some real heavy activity to loosen up a little so that we could cross the Channel and go to France. Stayed there a few days and then we started -- and then we went to Luxembourg, and from Luxembourg I know one time another nurse and I and a doctor and a couple of corpsmen were sent to somewhere in Germany. At that time everything was \"somewhere.\" No towns could be listed or anything so this was somewhere in Germany which from --and that from Luxembourg is a very, very short distance, and we went in one little old --one little Army ambulance at night. Of course it had been a blackout, and that was quite a trip because the --1n a complete blackout, and they had --I guess--I don't know how they ran that ambulance but must have been very dim lights, so you could see a little bit but not much 'cause anyway they came to a --a huge crater, bomb crater in the road, and the driver had to stop just short of that because he didn't have lights, he couldn't see, but he knew there was something there, and he got out--and he flashed --you had to flash your flashlights down to the ground. Never up or out but down to the ground, and I remember him flashing that around to see how big the crater was so he could go around it; and down in a ravine by the road we heard these flashes of lights and heard some kind of firing, some kind of skirmishing down there, and we finally reached our destination. Then the next morning we were really balled out for having come because it was so dangerous, but our commanding officer hadn't known that. Somehow the communications hadn't been so good so we got to this --where we were detached to this very small outfit, and they needed --they just needed help so badly. That's why we were detached there, and they had a lot of German wounded too."

That may have been --I can't remember. Anyhow it was very heavy fighting, big battle, very important fighting at that time, and we had many American casualties. That's why we had to stay in England awhile to take care of them and wait for things to calm down a little bit in Germany and France, so that--that was it until we rejoined our own hospital from this little--whatever that was.

Perhaps some people did, I don't know, but I think for the most part all of us were living just by the day because we didn't know if we'd be moving out the next day or what would happen because we didn't --we kept our patients --we were not supposed to keep them over 24 hours and then they were sent back to the rear, so I think we lived essentially --everything was so fast, and perhaps we were moving so fast, everything happened so fast that we didn't really think about tomorrow. Now, I'm sure that people who were moving our little hospital for us had to plan all of that. You know, the logistics had to be tremendous, but the rest --the nurses and doctors and corpsmen just lived for that time."

You haven't seen the pictures because it's just been liberated, just now getting people in and getting the pictures, and so when we arrived there, I can't remember that we even spoke to each other. There were very few of us, so we had to have gone in shifts. Very few of us, and I can't remember even speaking to anybody because it was such a shock; but nobody broke down and wept or had hysterics, and I don't know if part of that was the training you've had as a medical group or not, but I just remember silence, and the shock is incredible and you --perhaps walk through in a bit of a daze because who can --who can assimilate to all of this. You can't. And we were shown through the camp. I don't remember by whom. Probably -- probably some of the soldiers who had liberated them, I'm not sure, but we were shown through the camp around the grounds, and the inmates who were there were still dressed in their striped uniforms and so happy, so filled with joy and trying so hard to do anything they could for us, and I think --I could be wrong here but I think it was both American and British who liberated Buchenwald, but I'm not certain, but all I saw were American soldiers there.

For them to change their position to turn over, I'm sure they had to slide out and start again. Just a --just probably the head cleared. I think that was about all to get four bunks high.

Absolutely literal. And they had been given some black bread by the Americans I'm sure, and they wanted to share it with us. Now, had we been older, more mature, we would have accepted as their guests because who had they been able to share with or had anything to share with?

At the time we went there, I believe there were three of us nurses and the chief nurse, she went there for some reason, we went along with her, and we happened to be at the time that they were -- that the Americans had this camp, they were issuing clothing to the inmates. There again they had their striped uniforms. I suppose because they were issuing--we were issuing -- the Americans were issuing clothing, there came the men sort of in a column coming in to get their clothing, and they were stark naked, not a stitch on them. They came in where we --three or four women were, and they smiled, and they acted as if they were clothed, + clothes. And we had to look at them as if they were clothed, smile at them and, of course, we didn't speak German, they didn't speak English but, you know, the --probably some handling which--you know, all that -- as if nothing had happened, and we were told that these were political prisoners; that some of the best minds in Germany were probably there, but they were not politically correct, and yet what grabbed my attention was that these men didn't seem to be aware --of course they were aware they didn't have clothes on, but they didn't seem somehow to acknowledge that.

Of course the fence had been built by the Germans to keep the inmates in but also kept us separated from them, and we were there a few weeks probably, and there were so many children and so many of these were French. Probably most of them were French, but there were children of all ages there, and I remember we would--maybe a couple of us nurses would go for a little walk around the compound and, of course, we couldn't go far but just go around the compound, and these children would line up around the fence. They weren't allowed out, and they too were absolutely skin and bones. No --no flesh, no muscle that you could see, just --just skin and bones. They'd line up at the fence looking at us, and we might have a bit of chocolate or something with us, and you'd want to give it to them, or fruit, whatever, so badly. Anything you had. But we were told --we were threatened, I suppose, can't give them anything because it would have killed them. They were just on liquids for several days, then they would graduate to a soft diet, then regular food. And one night when we were there, it was very --very striking, very impressive. Some of our big cargo planes, American cargo planes came--now the war is over -- came in to take these --the French people back to Paris, and they were so thrilled, so excited about going home that they took everything that was made of wood from the barracks, put it in a huge, huge pile. I don't know how many feet high. Just as high as they could stack it. Set it afire after dark and sang \"The Marseille.\" That was impressive. Very, very wonderful time for them.

Was propaganda. So again someone else didn't believe it, and then I --that makes me believe there might be a lot of people that believe this never happened, therefore, the story has to be told, has to be kept because I can't imagine there'd be anyone who would think it hadn't happened. I know they're teaching it in the schools today, and there --they --I think they're teaching it--quite a bit about it, and yet there are those who don't believe, and I can't --apparently they don't want to believe it.
