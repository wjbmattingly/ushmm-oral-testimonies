My\nname is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for joining\nus. We are in our 17th year of the First Person program. Our First Person today is Mrs. Rita Rubinstein,\nwhom we shall meet shortly.\n\nThis 2016 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis Franklin\nSmith Foundation, with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation. We are\ngrateful for their sponsorship. I'd like to acknowledge Mr. Louis Smith who is with us in the audience,\nright here.\n>> [Applause]\n>> Bill Benson: First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with\nus their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our First Person guests\nserves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue twice-weekly until mid-August.\nThe museum's website, listed on the back of your program, provides information about each of our\nupcoming First Person guests. The address is www.ushmm.org.\n\nAnyone interested in keeping in touch with the Museum and its programs can complete the\nStay Connected card in your program or speak with a museum representative at the back of the\ntheater. In doing so, you will receive an electronic copy of Rita Rubinstein's biography so that you can\nremember and share her testimony after you leave here today.\n\nRita will share her \"First Person\" account of her experience during the Holocaust and as a\nsurvivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows we will have an opportunity for you to ask Rita questions.\n\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear\nfrom Rita is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation to\nhelp with her introduction.\n\nWe begin with this portrait of Rita, shown here between her Aunt Bella and cousin, Bayla\nShulwolf, who perished in the Holocaust.\n\nRita was born Rifka Lifschitz in December 1936 in Vascauti, Romania. The arrow on this map\npoints to Vascauti.\n\nHere we see an engagement photograph of Rita's parents, Tabel and Avraham.\n\nRita's father ran a dry goods store and small factory with her sister and brother-in-law in this\nhouse, pictured on the right, which also served as the family home. Their factory had a few looms to\nweave native Ukrainian clothing that was sold in the store.\n\nIn 1940, the Soviet Army marched into Vascauti and drafted young men, including Rita's\nfather, into the Army. When Axis troops invaded the Soviet Union the next year, Romanian soldiers\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n2\nentered Vascauti and told all the Jews to prepare to leave within 24 hours. Rita's family was able to\nbribe Romanian soldiers, who took the family to a ghetto in Transnistria. The area known as\nTransnistria is shown on this map.\n\nOnce there, a village family took Rita's family in. Rita was able to attend a small class but\nduring the three years the family lived in the ghetto they faced terrible hardships. After they were\nliberated the family was eventually able to return home.\n\nAfter the war, Rita attended a Ukrainian school in what had become Communist Romania. By\nobtaining false papers, Rita, her mother, and her aunt were able to travel from Romania to a Displaced\nPersons Camp in Germany that was administered by the U.S. United Nations relief organization, and\nHIAS.\n\nWe close our slide show with this photo of Rita in her Purim costume.\n\nRita arrived in the United States in 1949 with her mother and her mother's husband, an\nAuschwitz survivor whom she met in the Displaced Persons camp. They settled in New York City. Rita\nmarried Nathan Rubinstein in 1959 the same year Nathan entered the University of Maryland for his\nMaster's degree. Rita graduated from Brooklyn College in 1960 then joined Nathan in Maryland where\nshe began teaching elementary school in Olney, Maryland, just outside of Washington DC. She left\nteaching to have and raise their three daughters, Nina, Sheri, and Rene. When the girls were older,\nRita began teaching at a Yiddish Hebrew school then later became its principal. After retiring from the\nschool Rita became a private tutor for bar and bat mitzvahs, including for adults who haven't had their\nbar or bat mitzvah.\n\nNathan passed away at age 58 in 1995. He had lost most of his family during the Holocaust\nbut he survived with his parents in Siberia. After the war they came to the U.S. After service in the U.S.\nArmy, Nathan began a career as a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Research Lab in Baltimore\nwith a top secret clearance.\n\nTheir three daughters have a combined eight grandchildren. Daughter Nina is an industrial\npsychologist with two children. Daughter Sheri is an attorney with four children and Rene is a pediatric\nnurse at Johns Hopkins hospital with two children. Four of Rita's grandchildren are now college\ngraduates. Her oldest grandson just completed his first year of Dental School at the University of\nMaryland. Rita plans to attend the graduations of two other grandchildren next spring; one from the\nUniversity of Michigan and the other from high school. Rita's daughter Sheri is here with Rita today, as\nis Rene's daughter and Rita's granddaughter Chelsea, and Rita's cousin Cheryl Silverman. They are all\nwith us right here in the front row.\n\nRita is very active in the community. 17 years ago she formed a singing group, the Happy\nMatzah Balls, which still performs at area nursing homes, senior centers and such places at the\nNational Institute of Health and the Catholic University of America, as well as here at the museum. She\nalso sings with the Encore Chorus. Rita is a volunteer at a local hospice and has traveled to Israel to do\nvolunteer work for the Israeli Army. And Rita volunteers here at the museum, as well, by translating\ndocuments and videos of survivor experiences during the Holocaust from Yiddish to English. She is\nspeaking publicly more frequently about her Holocaust experience including recently at granddaughter\nChelsea's school and Roland Park School for Girls in Baltimore.\n\nWith that, | would like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Rita Rubinstein.\n>> [Applause]\n>> Bill Benson: Rita, thank you so much for joining us and being willing to be our First Person and\nhaving several of your family members in attendance with us today. You have a great deal to tell us so\nwe will start right away.\n\nAlthough World War II began with Germany and the Soviet Union attacking Poland in\nSeptember 1939, war didn't come directly in your community in Romania until 1940. Before we turn to\nyour life during the war and the Holocaust, let's start first with you telling us a little bit about your family\nand their community and your early life before war actually began for you.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n3\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Ok. That's going back a long way. As you heard, I'm 79 now. Going back to age 4,\n| have fragmented pieces of memory but | do remember some happy times, thank God. You know, as a\nhuman being, we try to block out the bad. Remember the bad, too, of course.\n\n| had a wonderful family. My dad, mother, lived with us. We shared a two-family home. He\nwas doing well. He had two sisters in the United States who emigrated when they were only 16 and 17\nbecause my grandmother was a widow, left with four children after World War |. So she sent the other\ntwo to the golden land where you could find gold. But they wound up working in sweatshops. So we did\nhave some family whom | never met. My mother had not met either. And her two younger children were\nleft with her. And then they did well. They had a textile machine, weaving room. They would weave\nnative costumes, as you mentioned, and scarves.\n\nMy mother stood in a store. They had a store, two-family house. It was a modern house. We\nhad a radio. We had electricity, not running water yet but we had a nanny for me. My grandmother lived\nwith us. My father's mother. And then his sister and two children and the grandmother -- my uncle's\nmother lived with them as well. So we had two older -- we were all together in the one house.\n\nIt was a very happy time. | had a doll carriage, dolls, lots of friends. | was the first\ngrandchildren. My mother was one of eight children. Unfortunately only two of them, she and her sister,\nsurvived. My grandparents lived in a small village not far from us. We would frequently visit them. They\nwere doting grandparents. | had aunts and uncles and aunts only seven years older than us.\n>> Bill Benson: So a very large extended family.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Large extended family. My grandmother, who lived with us, didn't want me to\nmake use of the doll carriage too much. She says, \u201cDon't take it out so much.\u201d Unfortunately little did\nwe know that | would not use it for very long period of time.\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit about your mother and father. What do you know about your father?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: My father was a wonderful -- what | heard because | don't really recall. | do recall\nthat he would take me every Sabbath to temple. He loved to perform services. Of course, he had lost\nhis father but he did a lot of good for people. In the dry goods store, if somebody could not afford an\nitem that they like, he would get them credit. Said \u201cDon't worry. Pay me when you can.\u201d Very charitable.\n>> Bill Benson: Had a lovely voice, you told me. Right?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Oh, yes. He had a wonderful voice. They wanted him to conduct services. He also\nserved on the ritual committee. So | tried to follow in his footsteps. | guess | love to sing and that's\nwhere | inherited that from him.\n>> Bill Benson: You definitely continued that.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: One of your grandfathers served in the First World War. Is that right?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. He was killed then.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you know anything about his service?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Not really. No.\n>> Bill Benson: What languages did your family speak?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Ok. Well, this was Austra-Hungary before | was born. Then it became Romania. |\nwas born in Romania. So a lot of the Jewish families spoke German to their children but my\ngrandmother, may she rest in peace, she insisted that her granddaughter would speak Yiddish and\nthanks to her that | did speak Yiddish. And | learned how to read and write it later on in D.P. camp. So\nthat's where | have the love of Yiddish as well, thanks to her. They also spoke German, Romanian. | did\nnot speak Romanian at all because | had not gone to school there.\n>> Bill Benson: Rita, of course, war began when the Soviet Union and Germany attacked Poland in\n1939, beginning World War Il. It was some months later, though, before war directly affected you and\nyour family when the Soviets occupied your hometown of Vascauti in Romania in 1940. Although you\nwere not yet 4 at that time, tell us what you can from what you've been able to gather and learn and\nfragments you remember about the time under the Soviet occupation of the first time that you were\noccupied by the Soviets.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n4\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Well, our happy family life really changed. We had to close the store. My mother's\nsister had been with us. That was her good luck. She was with us for a year. She was seven years\nyounger than my mother.\n>> Bill Benson: Bella?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: The only surviving sister. Right. She worked at a tax office. | was no longer free to\nplay in the streets. They took all the -- they conscripted all the able-bodied men into the Army. And, of\ncourse, my father was one of the able-bodied men. That was the last time | was to see him. | was 4 1/2\nat the time.\n>> Bill Benson: So he's conscripted into the Soviet Army?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Into the Soviet Army. For some reason my uncle was not. That was the last time |\nsaw my dad, when he left with the Russian Army. But at least | have the knowledge that he was fighting\nagainst the Germans. He was in their Army.\n\n| have -- well, we'll talk about that.\n\n>> Bill Benson: We'll come back to that later.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Tell me -- many other men were drafted into the labor brigades and into the Army. Your\nfather was just 36 or 37 years of age at that time, | think. Now it's your mother and your aunt. Your\nfather's gone. Do you know how they were able to make ends meet during that time?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: There was a black market. They used to barter, you know, have exchanges. It\nwas a tough time for us.\n>> Bill Benson: One of the things | know you're going to talk to a little bit later is about what you\nbrought with you, the prayer shawl that was your father's.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: That was my father's.\n>> Bill Benson: | Know we'll come back to that. You mentioned that it was Bella's good fortune that she\nwas with you. Say a little bit more about that. Why was it her good fortune?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: The reason it was her good fortune, my grandfather also owned a dry goods store\nas well as an orchard. He had many friends, Ukrainian friends. And they, too, would come -- he was a\nvery pious man. My grandmother worked very hard. She had eight children. She did everything from\nscratch. Even her jams were made from scratch, everything. All of that changed, of course, when the\nUkrainian neighbors who were friends, they thought -- there's a special exhibit, in fact. They turned on\nus. We did not know that until after the war. After the war my mother wanted to know what happened to\nher family. They described to her the horrible death that they met. They used harm implements. My\ngrandfather had to witness how they brutally murdered my aunt and uncle. Telling that to a survivor, my\nmother was 28 at the time, to hear the horrible death that they met. It was -- needless to say.\n>> Bill Benson: | think we're right around the anniversary date of when that happened.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. Yes. And he was left till the end. He had to witness how they murdered, not\nkilled but really murdered, his family and then they murdered him, a horrible end.\n>> Bill Benson: June 22, 1941, 75 years ago today, Germany and its allies turned on the Soviets and\nRomanian troops, Germany's allies, occupied your town.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes, they did.\n>> Bill Benson: And that's when things really turned profoundly worse. Tell us -- you remember, as |\nunderstand, when the Romanian troops marched in.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us about that time and what happened once you were under the control of the\nRomanians and the Nazis.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | do remember the march. In fact, my cousin, who was seven years older than I,\nhe was adventurous. He went up to the attic and looked outside. He was watching them march. A\nsoldier noticed that somebody was looking out. They came in with bayonets. They said, \"Ok. You have\nspies here.\" Here was my mother, my grandmother, and then my aunt and uncle. We did not know\nwhat to do. We were really frightened. The kids all went under the beds. They said, \u201cLook, we didn't\nmean any harm. He just looked outside.\u201d\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n5\n>> Bill Benson: Just a little boy.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. He was just a little boy. He was about 9 or 10, not even. Yeah. So that was\nfirst taste of it.\n\nThen they took -- my aunt was working, as | explained before. They took 20 Jews out in the\ncourtyard, at random, really; just because they were Jews. They wanted to show everybody their\nstrength and what they would do. They shot them simply because they were Jews. And one of them\nworked in the same office as my aunt. He was an engineer.\n\nIn September of 41, an announcement was made to all the Jews that we had to be ready\nwithin 24 hours to leave our home and only could take with us whatever we could carry, nothing else.\nMy mother had hidden what was dear to us. That's why | have some pictures, some of my friends who\nare survivors have no pictures of their youth. She put photographs and some money in the attic but in\nthe floor of the attic. My grandmother -- | remember that. She had money sewn in her undergarments\nand | said, grandma, what are you doing that for? She said, \"You never know. It might save our lives.\"\nAnd, indeed, she was a wise lady. It did save our lives. | do remember being bundled up in layers and\nlayers of clothing.\n>> Bill Benson: So take whatever you could carry. So you put lots of clothes on.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Exactly. And bedding. And they had it in sacks. My mother held on to my father's\nsuits and his prayer shawl. It's amazing that's the only thing that did survive the war. So it has a lot of\nmeaning to me.\n>> Bill Benson: When they told you to be prepared to leave in 24 hours, do you know if you had any\nidea where they intended to take you?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Actually, no. But word was that they were supposed to take us to a death camp.\nWe were taken by a train. We were in a holding place. My uncle had overheard some people. We were\nsupposed to be in the death camp.\n>> Bill Benson: Who was with you at this point?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Oh, at this point, ok, there were nine of us.\n>> Bill Benson: Nine of you. Ok.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: My aunt and her children and husband and her mother-in-law, and my Aunt Bella,\nmy mother's sister, my mother, my grandmother, and myself. So there were nine. And we were all\ntogether.\n>> Bill Benson: And you had heard that you were going to end up going to a death camp.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. Of course our life was in danger because they could have shot us. This was\nat night that we snuck out. They took us across a river on barges. There were many soldiers, even\nthough they took the money, that's where my grandmother's money --\n>> Bill Benson: Go back over that. Your uncle, this is where he bribed soldiers?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: He bribed them with the money that my grandmother had.\n>> Bill Benson: So to avoid going where you thought you were going.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Right. They were going to take us to Transnistria, Shargorot, a ghetto. In one\nspecial place you had restrictions. You could only go out at certain times. But I'll explain the conditions\nthere.\n\nLet me get back to the point.\n>> Bill Benson: Your uncle bribes.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. We snuck out at night. We were on a barge crossing the Dnieper River. A\nsoldier was holding me by the hand. | was a blond, brown eyes at the time. And the soldier -- there\nwere some righteous -- thank God there were righteous gentiles. There were always good people. |\nwish there had been more. Some more people would have been saved. He looked at my mother's\nanguished face and said, \"Don't worry. | have a little girl just like that at home and | will do no harm to\nyour child.\" He meant what he said. We thank God, crossed the Dnieper River and it was ok. So that\nwas first time she almost lost me. But one of a few times.\n>> Bill Benson: You had explained to me before that there were other children on barges who didn't\nmake it.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n6\n>> Rita Rubenstein: They were thrown into the river. They didn't know how to swim. | did not know how\nto swim either. So if the same would have been -- would have happened to me.\n>> Bill Benson: So thanks to your uncle using the money that your grandmother had hidden, as you\ndescribed, you were able to make it across the river. And now you're in Shargorot. And you would\nremain there for three years in the ghetto of Shargorot.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Although life there was very, very, very hard, you remember there were actually some\ngood memories of that time, too. Can you tell us? Tell us about that time. You spent three years there.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Well, there was a Jewish family.\n>> Bill Benson: Ok.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: There were Jews there, in the ghetto. They were forced to take us in. They were\nvery kind to take us in. This was so different from what we were -- it was a clay hut, really, one bedroom\nheated by a potbelly stove, very primitive conditions. They had no bathroom. It was bitter cold. Excuse\nme for saying, but we had to use the pail. They were a family of four. And nine of us came. So there\nwere 13 in that small hut. We were rationed. We had no food. There, too, was a black market. My aunt\nhad wonderful abilities as a knitter and would sneak out on the black market to bring us a little piece of\nbread, potatoes.\n\nThe nutrition was not very good, to say the least. And how we managed in that house, | don't\nknow. And my uncle developed Typhus. They left us after about a year because it was just too hard to\nbe together. We didn't have enough food. They went to a different labor camp.\n\nAt that ghetto there were soldiers, Romanian soldiers that came and took my aunt every day\nto work in the field.\n>> Bill Benson: Aunt Bella?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yeah. | don't know why they didn't take my mother. She never shared it with me.\nShe did not like to speak about her experiences too much. She didn't want me to tell my children. \"Oh,\nwhy pain them?\" | said it's important that they know what life was like and how lucky we are in this\ncountry to have everything.\n>> Bill Benson: One of the things you shared with me was you remembered the sense of always being\nhungry.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Always hungry.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Always being hungry. Mentioned a little kindergarten class was formed.\n>> Bill Benson: In the ghetto?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: In the ghetto. That's where | had my first experience with Hebrew. | was thrilled to\ndeath when | was able to tell them that today | had a piece of bread and oil. But children, children\nalways find playthings. My mother made us a rag doll. What saved us, really, was | was never\nseparated from my mother. | was very fortunate. | saw death in the streets.\n>> Bill Benson: People literally starved to death and you remember that.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Starved to death.\n\nShe went to the river, which was at least about a mile, to wash our clothing. Cleanliness was\nvery important. We found little pebbles. They made us a makeshift road.\n>> Bill Benson: Those were your play toys?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Those were my toys. Once | went to do laundry with my mother with my cousin. |\nguess the doll clothes that they made for us. | fell into the river. My cousin said, \"Oh, look, Aunt Tabel,\nthere's a little girl in the water.\" She didn't know how to swim. | didn't know how to swim. She threw in a\nsheet and | hung on to it. It was such atraumatic experience | could not speak for at least three days.\nAnd they had some witchcraft performed. Some woman came. She cracked some eggs on my\nforehead.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you remember that?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | do remember it. It was very weird. She said --\n>> [Laughter]\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n7\n>> Rita Rubenstein: \"Don't worry. She will speak.\" | started speaking again.\n>> Bill Benson: So it worked.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Who knows? Yes it did work. It did work.\n>> Bill Benson: During that time after your father had been conscripted into the Soviet Army, do you\nknow if your mother had any contact, had any word from him, any idea where he had gone?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: No. We had no inkling whatsoever.\n>> Bill Benson: Once he left he was gone.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: And my grandmother was really beside herself. She was very ill. At the time, |\ndon't know if you know this, some people who are not Jewish probably don't know, but we are buried in\nshrouds. And my grandmother had a little sack of soil, because we're supposed to be buried with a little\nsoil from Israel. And | questioned -- you know, as a child you question why is this, why is that. Why are\nyou having these white things sewn? She said, \"I'm not going to be here long. You're my grandchildren.\n| want you to light the candles when I'm gone.\" She's the only one that really died in actual death there\nand the only one that | have a gravesite for.\n>> Bill Benson: And that's in Shargorot?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: That's in Shargorot, which I've never gone back. | really have no desire to. Those\nmemories were not good memories. But | remember that. | remember her death.\n\nOf course, the ritual committee came. They had to prepare her, put on the garments. | saw all\nof that. But at that time they did not take me to the cemetery. They felt | was too young. | saw a lot. It\nwas a great loss. That | remember. And | remember lighting a candle for her. So there were hard times\nbut we were with very kind people. As poor as they were, out of the goodness of their heart, they really\ntook us in.\n>> Bill Benson: And it sounds like during that time in the ghetto with this kind, good-hearted family, that\neverybody tried to make the best of having a community as much as you could under those\ncircumstances.\n\nThe Soviets came back to Shargorot, however, in early 1944, but this time they were\nconsidered liberators.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: They were liberators.\n>> Bill Benson: They were.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: We started hearing -- to this day | really can't stand a lot of noise. And another\npoint, | am very afraid of big dogs, like German Shepherds, because | used to see them chase Jews. It\nwas very frightening.\n\nIn fact, here in the United States | had to ask my friend who had a German Shepherd to\nplease put him in a kennel because really --\n>> Bill Benson: So frightening.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. Very frightened. Certain things stay with you. | can explain why now. I've\ngotten better. One of my daughters had a dog, a golden retriever. They are much gentler. | got used to\nit.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. It was very, very hard.\n\nWhen the front came, the Russians, we heard a lot of bombing. The proprietor of the little\nhouse that we were in went to a neighbor because the neighbor had a cellar. He said if there's bombing\nhere, we need to go down into the cellar. So we were there quite a number of people. A 12-year-old\nboy could not stand it anymore. He had to see what was happening. So he ran outside. And when he\ncame back, he was all excited. People thought: He's hallucinating, what's going on? He said, \"No, no,\nno. There were Russians drinking in the streets and we are free. The war is over.\" And then we started\nbelieving him. And everybody went outside. And, indeed, the war was over.\n>> Bill Benson: For you. For where your community was.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: For us but not in other parts of the world, no. Because, as you know, the\nHungarian Jews were taken much later.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n8\n>> Bill Benson: But where you happened to be, the good fortune of the Soviets arriving and liberating\nyOu.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Right.\n>> Bill Benson: As you said, the war is over, free to go. What did that mean, \"Free to go\" for you and\nyour family?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Very hard. We didn't know where to go, really. Every door there was a song -- to\nthe right every door is closed to me. Although | was born in Romania, | didn't feel like a Romanian\nbecause | was robbed of everything. However, they wanted to go back home. My mother wanted to\nhear what happened to her family, what happened to her husband. But the Iron Curtain started setting\nin then, too. The Russians were taking over. They had schools that were established there. So we had\na difficult journey to get there.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you remember how you even got there?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Well, from what my aunt had told us, she knew somebody, not Jewish, somebody\nfrom the government, a mother. So she helped her do some research where we could go safely\nbecause sometimes if you returned -- | know from my husband's stories and friends of mine, when they\nreturned home in Poland, the Pols said, \u201cWhat are you doing here? We thought you were murdered.\u201d\nBecause they took over their home and they would murder the survivors. So you had to be lucky. That\nwas also good luck. And a lot of some good people, thank God for them, the righteous gentiles.\n\nSo it was --\n>> Bill Benson: And plus trains weren't running normally.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Right. We went on a military train.\n>> Bill Benson: A military train.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. A military train. We went back home. We went back home. We could not go\ninto our house. The Russians had used it as a silo. They had grains there. And my mother begged\nthem. She said, \"I just want go in the attic.\" \"My husband fought in your Army.\" At that point she did not\nknow yet that my father was killed. So finally they were convinced. And because of the soldier, he also\nlet us into my maternal grandparents' house. They owned the house but there were other families there\nbut they let us have a room there. Housing was very hard.\n>> Bill Benson: But you were not allowed to take your home back.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Oh, no. No. But they did allow my mother to go in. She retrieved the pictures.\n>> Bill Benson: Which is why you have the photographs.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Of course, the money was gone but that's ok, we had our lives.\n>> Bill Benson: And a few pictures.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: And our pictures. And my aunt started working in a bank there to sustain us to\nbring food on the table. My mother would also go with my aunt and they would sell things to put food on\nthe table.\n>> Bill Benson: Even though it's still wartime and the Soviets are moving on, moving further west, were\nyou able to resume school? You're now about 7 years of age, school age. Did that sort of sense of\nnormalcy begin to return?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Sort of, yes. What happened was | went to a Ukrainian school run by the\nRussians. We were indoctrinated to Stalin's victor. | remember walking to school. It was bitter cold.\n\nAlso, they did not celebrate Christmas as such but they celebrated Father Frost. They would\nhave a big celebration. Then they had us recite poetry. | had to memorize a poem and recite that. |\nremember that. | was a good student. | was just in first grade.\n\nWe saw that things were not good. And that's when my mother also discovered what\nhappened to her parents. And my father's friend, best friend, who also had been conscripted into the\nArmy --\n>> Bill Benson: With him?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Came back. He knew exactly when my father was killed. But at least | had the\nknowledge that he was fighting against --\n>> Bill Benson: He was killed in action.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n\n9\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | knew. | had the date.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you know if at that time if your mother and the other adults, did they begin to have a\nsense of the enormity of what had happened during the Holocaust, what had happened to Jews\nthroughout Europe?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Oh definitely. Yes. We found out the horrible things that happened, and for our\nwhole family and extended family. They were either murdered or they starved to death. They couldn't\nexist, working hard labor, just on a piece of bread and black water that they called coffee, potato and\nwater.\n>> Bill Benson: Were any of our other family members able to make it back?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: From extended family? No.\n>> Bill Benson: No?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: No. Just my aunt, my father's sister, and her family two children. They survived.\nAnd the grandmother. Their grandmother. Mine died, as | said before. My mother and my aunt.\n\nThen we had to find a way to get out of town because we saw the hand writing on the wall.\nThe Iron Curtain was setting in. Where would we go? We had to get out. So we had falsified papers\nsaying that we were born in Poland. And when we were about to leave, my aunt who was still working\nat the bank --\n>> Bill Benson: Bella.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Bella. They would not allow her, until the last minute, to go on that train. It was not\na luxury train. There was also another incident there, a wonderful young man who is looking over\ndocuments and all. He knew who we were because his mother had been a Christian young man. His\nmother was a midwife to my grandmother and helped deliver some of her children. But he didn't\ndisclose the fact that we were Romanian. He looked away and let us go on the train. He could have and\nwe wouldn't have been able to leave. The last minute they allowed my aunt to come and we went on\nthe train.\n>> Bill Benson: They thought you were going to go to Poland?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Actually, we did.\n>> Bill Benson: You did go to Poland. OK.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: We had a long journey. That journey | do remember. Because we hopped on\ntrains, on trace cars, on coal cars. It took us three months to get from Romania to Germany.\n>> Bill Benson: Via Poland.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: To go to different borders. We posted Greeks, posted different nationalities. They\nwould search us and send the children. As Greeks we asked for Mayan, water in Hebrew. They didn't\nknow the difference. So they passed us up quickly.\n>> Bill Benson: So after three months you made it into Germany. Why Germany?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Ok, in Germany -- that's a good question.\n>> Bill Benson: Yeah. Why Germany?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Because they established Displaced Persons Camps in Germany. That's where\nsurvivors wound up. In fact, in some of the very same barracks where the SS were trained we had\nthese quarters. But at least we had shelter. But life was reborn. There were many sad, sad stories,\nparents who lost children and children who lost parents. | went with them to school.\n>> Bill Benson: And you did, too.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Oh, yeah. Some of them were hidden in convents. Some of them were hidden in\nhomes, Polish homes. And then the parents, some parents, came back or some relatives came back.\nSome of them thought they were Christian, didn't want to leave but then they did.\n\nThat's when | learned how to speak Polish. Some people approached my mother and started\nspeaking Polish. Why are you speaking Polish to me? | don't speak a word of it. Well, your daughter\nspeaks Polish. But as a child, you're forced to.\n\n| made some wonderful friends. Believe it or not, those who said, oh, school, do | have to go\nto school? Loved school. We were like sponges. We were missing that period. | don't consider that year\nin the Ukraine school as very memorable but here we learned history and had wonderful teachers.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n10\n\nThere were about a hundred of us. There were a lot of marriages. People who lost children. It\nwas So sad. | loved to perform. | was on stage there and learned how to sing and perform. My mother\nwas sitting in the audience and there was a woman with tears in her eyes. She said, \"| wonder if this\nchild's mother is still alive to see her.\" And she said, \"Yes, | am.\" She said, \"I lost a little girl like yours.\nYou're so lucky.\"\n\nBut as a result of our having lived through the war with the wonderful nutrition we had, | have\nhorrible teeth. I'm a dentist. So dream. And a lot of us because we didn't have toothbrushes. We really\nhad nothing.\n>> Bill Benson: No nutrition.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Right. Our nutrition was terrible. We had health exams in DP camps.\n>> Bill Benson: You were there for three years in the DP camps.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Three years. Made some wonderful friends. We went on different trips with the\nschool. But a lot of us were found to have tuberculosis. And | was one of them, unfortunately.\n\nHere, you have to remember this was in \u00b046, \u201847. | was in the camp from 46 to \u201c49. And \u00b047\nmy mother was told that | had TB and | had to go to a sanitarium. | was about 9 at the time when she\nleft me. She left me with other children. It was not nearby. It was an hour drive by train. | only saw her\nonce a week. When she came back, | was no longer with other children. | was quarantined. | spent nine\nmonths there with some nurses who were still very anti-Semitic. They would tell me whatever tests they\nwere going to do, \"You're going to cry.\" \"It's going to hurt.\" And | said, \"No, | will not cry.\" | gritted my\nteeth and tolerated the pain.\n\n| remember they had a wonderful social worker from HIAS came at least once or twice a\nweek. She brought me different art projects. Our family learned -- we got in touch with them in the\nUnited States. They would send packages. They couldn't, unfortunately, until the last minute send the\nmedicine | needed because they would only give streptomycin to people who had TB of the bones and |\nhad it in my lungs. So they had to perform surgery. And while they were performing surgery, my mother\ncame with the streptomycin.\n>> Bill Benson: From the family members that were in the United States sent it?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. They had sent it.\n>> Bill Benson: You were there for nine months.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | was for nine months. It was a difficult nine months.\n>> Bill Benson: Yes.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: But there were kind -- there was a kind Danish doctor. She told my mother, \"I\nsurvived TB. | have a family. | will see your daughter survives as well.\"\n>> Bill Benson: And in your first Displaced Persons Camp, | think that's where Bella met her husband.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Actually before. We were traveling in secret. We were in Poland and many\ndifferent places. She met him. He was a very fine, fine person. She emigrated -- there was of a quota\nsystem then, how they let people in. You had to have a sponsor. So she got to go to the United States\nwhile | was in the sanitarium. He was here earlier. She came in 47. We had to wait until 49. And\nespecially we had -- you all heard about Ellis Island. That was before they used to give people exams\nand then they held them on Ellis Island. But after the war, you had to pass all the health exams before\nyou boarded the ship to go to the United States. And we were very -- my mother was very frightened\nbecause | had TB if they saw any sign. But thank God | passed that.\n>> Bill Benson: You described to me -- you said, \"My mother was a survivor and a strong lady.\" Tell us\na little more about her. She was a strong lady. She got you through extraordinary difficult times.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: A lot of difficult times. Imagine yourself at 28 having lost your parents, having\nheard that you lost your husband whom you were married happily for a just seven short years. That's\nwhy my parents never had another child because Hitler's speeches were heard even the year that |\nwas born. They knew a younger child would not have made it. They didn't know what was waiting for\nthem but they felt they shouldn't have any more children.\n\nTo save my life she would do anything. She went on the black market with her sister-in-law\nand did a lot. She was told a widow should not come by herself to the United States, and that's when\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n11\nshe met my step-father, who was an Auschwitz survivor and lost his wife and child. He was\nconsiderably older, 15 years older.\n\nBut my time in DP camp, | really remember it was a happy time. Even though we had just one\nroom built we had the freedom. Education. | even took some piano lessons, | remember. And the\nGermans -- we use to the get canned food. We never heard of canned tuna but the Germans did. So\nmy mother and my step-father, they would give the Germans farmers the canned food and they would\nin turn give us --\n>> Bill Benson: You fresh food. | chuckled the first time you said we had this canned spam.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: They would happily take it.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Absolutely, soam, which is, of course, not kosher. At that point you ate anything\nthat you could get.\n>> Bill Benson: So 1949 you come to the United States.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | just wanted to make one point about the DP camp. General Eisenhower, he was\nonly general then, he came to visit.\n>> Bill Benson: To your camp?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: To our camp. But unfortunately | was in the sanitarium. But one of my friends,\nwhom I'm still in touch with now, she played the piano for him and everybody was so thrilled that\nGeneral Eisenhower, who later became president, was visiting.\n\nYes? I'm sorry?\n>> Bill Benson: So you come to the United States. Again, now you're in a new culture, a new\nlanguage. What was that like for you and your family, your mother?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: First of all, let me describe how | felt -- we did not go on a luxury liner. We went on\nan Army transport. It was called General Haan. We slept in bunk beds, right near the engine room. My\nmother said, please take the top bunk because if you get sick this way nobody, you know, you don't\nhave to worry. Of course, the people beneath me did.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Rita Rubenstein: My mother and | were ill the entire journey because September the ocean is very,\nvery rough. We could not eat anything. Half a grapefruit somebody would bring down.\n\nThe day that we landed in New York was one of the happiest days of my life, seeing that\nStatue of Liberty.\n>> Bill Benson: You remember that?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Oh my God. That's when my mother and | went up on the deck. At last we were\nfree, in a democratic country. | just can't describe it. We had family waiting for us, whom | had never\nseen before. We had a wonderful, wonderful reception.\n\nIt was hard because | was green, didn't speak a word of English. At that time there was no\nbilingual education. We also waited for quota. We were poor enough to get welfare but we did not want\nit. It was a shame to do that. My step-father did house painting. This is a country of opportunities. It was\nsink or swim. They put me in a class -- | was 12 when | arrived and they put me in a class that they\nwere giving French. | don't know what they were thinking.\n>> Bill Benson: They figured you already spoke so many languages, | guess.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | was given an |.Q. test. Later in high school | was called in to the principal's office.\n| said, \u201cWhat did | do?\u201d | knew | was a good student. He said, \u201cI've never seen anybody improve so\nmuch on an I|.Q. test as you have\u2019. And | said, \u201cYou took a green horn who was here only three months.\n| didn't know the difference between a shoe maker or a tailor and you gave me this test. It's a wonder |\neven passed it.\u201d | said, \u201cNow that explains why my I.Q. went up so much.\u201d\n>> Bill Benson: To make sure we have time for a few questions, just one more question. You said\nwhen you came to the United States --\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Is that yours or mine? [Mic popping]\n>> Bill Benson: Ok. Thank you, Sonya.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n12\n\nYour mother was very protective of you. Will you say a little bit about that? She was overly\nprotective in some ways.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | couldn't go ice skating. | couldn't do many things because she was afraid.\n\n[Mic popping]\n\nNow I'm afraid of the microphone.\n>> Bill Benson: She wouldn't let you ice skate. She protected you so much.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Right. | didn't have a bicycle. | didn't have a lot of things. But | had my life, my\nfreedom. | loved the United States. | am very patriotic. The flags are out all the holidays. You don't\nknow how lucky you are to be in a country where we can speak what's on our minds. We can criticize. |\nknow our candidates are not always great.\n>> [Laughter Applause]\n>> Rita Rubenstein: But at least we have the freedom.\n>> Bill Benson: Yes, we do.\n\nIf you're ok, why don't we turn to our audience and ask if they have questions to ask of you.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: And then my final statement?\n>> Bill Benson: Absolutely.\n\nIt's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. To close the program,\nI'm going to turn back to Rita and she will give us her concluding thoughts. But we have time for some\nquestions from you.\n\nBefore we do that, I'd like to ask you to stay with us so that you hear Rita's concluding\nremarks during the Q&A period. Stay with us. We have microphones that will be coming down the aisle.\nIf you have a question, please wait until you have the mic. Make the question as brief as you can. I'll\nrepeat it just to be sure everybody hears it. Then Rita will answer your question. And we won't have\nquestions about the elections.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: No. No.\n>> Bill Benson: So right in the front row. You have a question? Why don't we get the microphone down\nyou. | think we got one. Here we go. Got a microphone coming right here in the front row.\n\nThank you.\n>> My dear cousin, why didn't you and your mother join our other aunts and uncle with your children to\ngo to Israel instead of coming to the United States? I'm just curious.\n>> Bill Benson: Why Rita and family didn't join other family members and go to Israel and came to the\nUnited States instead?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Because my mother's only surviving sister went to the United States. In fact, |\nforgot to mention that when Israel was declared independent, | remember staying up all night, around a\nbonfire because at last we had a place to call our own, where to go to. But my mother said no. And my\ncousin was very Zionistic. He started to turn the channel; he said, \u201cI'm not going to the United States\u201d\neven though my aunt had two sisters here. He said, \u201c| wanted to go to my country.\u201d So that is the\nreason they went to Israel and | went to the United States. | wanted to be on the exodus. | told her\nsince I'm half an orphan. And she said, \u201cMy only child, you're not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nI'm very glad | made the choice to be here. Of course, | have a special love for Israel. Thank\nGod -- if we had been in Israel then, so many of the Jews would have been saved.\n>> Bill Benson: | Know you want to share with us.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes. The only thing. | feel such closeness to it. My father's prayer shawl which\namazingly -- | don't know how my mother managed to carry it with her all through the war. My late\nhusband used to wear it every holiday. And I, too. It's been present at every one of my grandchildren's\nbar and Bat Mitzvah. And whenever | wear it, | feel close to him. | feel like his spirit is with me.\nIt's beautifully made. | found out there's sterling silver. It's removable. | will always cherish it. His\nmemory is always with me but | feel a special bond by just having this. This one thing. My inheritance.\nAmongst other things, genes.\n>> Bill Benson: Absolutely.\n\nDo we have any questions? See if we have anybody else who has a question.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n13\n\nRight back here.\n>> After you moved to the United States, did you ever go back to Europe to visit?\n>> Bill Benson: After you came to the United States, did you ever go back to Europe and have you\nvisited or been back there?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: No. The only place, Italy and Spain. | can't bring myself to go to Germany. | don't\nblame the new generation but | just can't see myself spending money there. | know Israel has\nwonderful relations with Germany. | don't want to go back. | really don't have good memories other than\nthe very beginning of my childhood.\n>> Bill Benson: Ok. Thank you for that.\n\nAnother question right here. | think there's two. We have time -- just these two questions.\n\nLet me just mention, too, when Rita finishes with her closing remarks, Rita will stay up here on\nthe stage. So if anybody would like to come up and ask Rita another question or just, you Know, say hi,\nshake her hand or get a picture taken with her, please absolutely feel free to do that.\n\nIs that ok?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Sure.\n>> Bill Benson: All right. These last two questions then we'll close up the program.\n>> [Question Inaudible]\n>> Bill Benson: The question is about your aunts and uncles killed by gentile neighbors.\n>> [Question Inaudible]\n>> Bill Benson: They were killed by neighbors, your grandparents.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: By the same people that had been their neighbors.\n>> My question is after years of starvation, when you did come to America, what is your favorite food?\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: After all of those years of starvation and poor nutrition what is your favorite food?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | love sweets, of course.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Rita Rubenstein: You can see. In fact, my cousins here in the United States said because of you we\nhave to eat everything off our plate. Because your cousin after starving.\n>> [Laughter]\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | have a tendency to prepare way too much food. My kids always complain about\nthat.\n>> Bill Benson: There's nodding in the front row.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: | never had enough so my refrigerator is always full. And if I'm going to have\ndinner for five or eight, | think another five could drop in.\n>> Bill Benson: | could get in line?\n>> Rita Rubenstein: Absolutely.\n>> Bill Benson: | want to thank all of you for being with us today. | remind you we will have a First\nPerson program each Wednesday and Thursday until the middle of August. So we hope you can come\nback and join us. The website will have information about First Person 2017.\n\nWith that I'd like to turn to Rita to close today as a program.\n>> Rita Rubenstein: A senior moment. Thank you. Can | use this? Oh. Ok.\n\nOk. | thank God that we survived one of our darkest periods in history. I'm grateful to the\nUnited States for opening its doors to us. It's the greatest country, as | said, in the world. We should\nappreciate the freedom that we have and opportunities. I'm proud to be a U.S. citizen. | thank God our\nmen and women in the military and thank them for the sacrifices that they have made in protecting our\nfreedoms. We must remember that. We must remember the past, find courage in the future. We don't\nwant our past to be our children's and grandchildren's future.\n\nWe should never stand silent. Always speak up when you witness bullying, prejudicism. Hate\nis never, never right but love is always right. Always do the right thing. Always take a stand. When you\nsave one life, it's as though you have saved the world.\n\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n14\n\nI'm dedicating today to my grandparents who were brutally murdered by the neighbors, 75\nyears ago, to the memory of my father, the 11 million people -- it wasn't just Jews who were killed --\nand the 1.5 million innocent children and their only crime was being Jewish.\n\n| will continue telling my story. Now all of you will be able to pass it on to your children and to\nyour grandchildren. You can say you actually met a survivor because there are some deniers. Some\npeople say the Holocaust did not happen.\n\n| hope and pray that none of you will ever experience war and hunger. Unfortunately there is\nhunger in the world now. Remember what happened in Rwanda and Syria. My heart goes out to all of\nthem.\n\nMay we enjoy shalom which means peace in the world. God bless you all. God bless the\nUnited States of America. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.\n>> [Applause]\n\n",
