And I was one and a half years in Tarnopol in the army and I finished the army I came home again and I was working back again in the job. And in \u201839 before the war started, maybe a month, the town was small and we knew each other. A lot of friends. We were always talking politics on the streets and what will be, what will be, about Hitler came in \u201833 and we knew what was going on. The Pollacks were already showing their faces too. They didn't \u2014 so much the Pollacks like the Ukraine, there were very few Pollacks there. But the Ukrainians there, they showed us that we are Jews, and they are \u2014 we had fights with them. Not big ones, not killings, but fists fights and all kind of \u2014 I remember one Purim where we made some kind of a party and a Pollack came and he wanted to disturb this. And I had a big fight with him and he almost killed me because he was very big. I didn't give him an inch, I just gave him back. But he never forgot me this guy. He came after a few days after me. He almost killed me. Around the house he was waiting for me. At least, we had our share with this antisemitism. We did not feel so much in with Podhajce, like we felt in Lemberg. We felt it more in the bigger towns. They were they called it Endeks!. There was a group of Pollacks, the right wing and they were completely against the Jews and they were even killing before the war break. We had a big fight with them on the streets in the gardens and whatever \u2014 it was a street like in Akademicka. That remind me today somebody. Jews couldn't walk there. And there was the biggest houses belonged to Jews and there was a guy \u2014 Stricher(ph) was his name \u2014 he had this biggest house like on Akademicka street. He couldn't even collect the rent there. He couldn't go over because the antisemitism was so big and they couldn't \u2014 they were almost sitting in the streets daring, waiting for Jews to come and to beat them up.

My family was in Galicia, and then belonged to Russian and I was on the other side by the Germans and they were by the Russians. So 1941 they were under the Russian.

They knew what is going on the other side, because I was corresponding with them. As a prisoner of war, I had the right to write \u2014 to send letters and they were receiving the letters and they were answering me.

In the kitchen, I was making coffee and I was making lunch. And I once I made coffee and I didn't know what sugar is. They gave me the salt and sugar was for me the same. I never saw it before. And you had to \u2014 sugar was in lumps not loose. And I put in ..instead of sugar, I put in salt in the coffee in the morning, the group went to work, was Pollacks also, they were eating from this kitchen. They wanted to kill me because the coffee was salted and they figured \u2014 they called me in the Germans right away and they said it's sabotage and usually when \u2014 if I would be under the SS, I wouldn't live. They would kill me. But this was Wehrmacht\u00ae there. And some of them are still people today you could talk to. And I understand. told him this story that I didn't know what it is and I put in salt. And he let me go. But he gave me a lesson. I think he took me, he put me to work, but he was somehow lenient to me because I helped him out after a time in his office too. I write German fluently, and I was helping in the office to write it. And from \u2014 this was in Ludwigsburg, I think, yes. I was in Nuremberg, and then I was in Ludwigsburg and then I was in what the name? Munzinger. They were taking us from one place to the other. And then Munzinger, all of a sudden they decided or it's not \u2014 they, I mean, the headquarters \u2014 decided that all Jews have to be sent back to Poland. How\u201d? They said they don't want prisoners now. The Pollacks \u2014 the Polish war was finished. Why should they keep prisoners? \u201cYou are Jews, and no, no prisoners and we send you home.\u201d And they suppose to change, to change us over with the Russians.

They came with, with the dogs, peitsches\u2019, sticks and all kinds of this, and they were beating us right all the way to the camp. And they told, \"You are no more prisoners of war. You are Jews and we will be treated as Jews.\u201d But still they kept us separate. They didn't put us together with the ghetto. There was a ghetto. In Lublin there was a ghetto already then. And they did not put us in the ghetto. 01:19:35 But there was an interesting story. Before I came there was maybe a thousand prisoners. They were all Jews also, what came and they \u2014 the Germans brought them over to the Jews from the ghetto and they told them, \"You feed them. That's your Jews. You feed them.\u201d And they, they didn't have what to eat themselves in Lublin. The people, the population was very bad for the ghetto. And they said, \"We don't have food.\u201d They said, \"Good.\u201d They took them out and they killed all the prisoners of war, the whole thousand. Maybe \u2014 maybe a tenth was left over by the end. They brought them on the way to Lubartow, a small town, and then to Parczew. Maybe there was left maybe 10, maybe 20. I don't \u2014 I cannot tell exactly and there the people \u2014 the population, the Jewish population put them in right away and gave them food and they kept. I came after this and they felt that the Jews \u2014 they felt they had to do something. They made a kitchen for us in the camp. They brought over and they was cooking for us meals, and they kept us there. The leadership there was from the SS. There was Riedel\u00ae was the leader, and there was Dolp\u2019 was a small officer. He was the terror of all Lublin and the terror from all over in Poland. Dolp was known all over. Dolp came in on a horse to the camp and if he saw somebody laying in the bed sick or somebody didn't get up so fast in the morning, he shot him right on the spot. And we had a lot of problems there in the camp. I was still on the, on the care of this hospital whatever because I was shot and I had always showed this paper I had from the Germans that I cannot work so hard. Others were working out and in the beginning also I went out to work and we built the known Majdanek camp, Majdanek concentration camp. They built from the prisoners of war. We built it. And after this was ready, we were still there. They brought in the first prisoners of war from Russia. The war with Russia started in 1941. I think in July, June. I don't remember exactly the date. And when the war started the first prisoners of war in Majdanek were Russians and they said \u2014 the Germans said that they are not Russians \u2014 just prisoners, but they are commissars. They are officers something like communists real, and they have to die. And they were dying like flies. I don't know if they gave them poison or whatever they gave them, they were dying. They had typhus there and they were dying. And we got \u2014 we caught from them typhus from the Russians. Me too. I got sick. I got the typhus. And they brought \u2014 they didn't want to give us any care because they were afraid that we will \u2014 they will get sick to the Germans, and they took us out and they put us in a synagogue. In the synagogue they put on the floor nothing to cover. Nothing. We just stayed there. We were about 400 sick people and I think 300 died.

And people were asking me always the questions about this. Why there is antisemitism? And I told once a story and I don't know why it came to me the story. I was reading it or something that men \u2014 a priest asked a man to come into his church. He didn't see him a long time in the church. He said, \"Why should I go to the church. You always talk nonsense?\" He said, \"No, no. Come over. I will have a very nice sermon. Come over.\u201d The man came out. The churchman talks as a sermon about Jews. He said that the Jews killed Christ. The Jews need blood for matzos and all the bad things in the world comes from the Jews. He heard a sermon against the Jews. The Pollack walked out and he grabbed a Jew on the street. They start beating him up. Then the church man came out, the priest came out and said, \"Why do you beat this Jew?\" He said, \"What do you mean why I am beating?\" You just told me what the Jews did. They killed Christ and, and all kinds of things.\u201d He said, \"Wait a second. That was 2000 years ago. That was a long time ago.\u201d He said, \"No, \" to the priest. \"You told it to me today and while you talking about this, we are listening.\u201d And that's what it was. They were listening to the priest. The priest were always talking about this, that Jews are a menace. \u201cThe Jews killed Christ.\u201d But they never told them that Christ was a Jew himself.

I was always like in a scout and this was in my mind, it will be like the army. It is not a partisans, I have no idea what it is. And when we came these two guys start leading us, starting showing us what to do, how to do. And the first thing we went through a water. We had to , a Small river and we had to take off the shoes and they showed us how to cross and by one by one we crossed the water and we came on the other side. And then they brought us over to a place in the woods, deep in the woods and he said \u2014 there was not far a river \u2014 and he said, \"Here we will make a camp. In the night \u2014 we will go every night,\u201d we were 22 people, \u201cOn \u2014 11 under your leadership and the other 11 going with...,\u201d Kaganowicz was the other guy \u2014 he was a leader too. \u201cWe will go \u2014 11 people we will go into the farmers in the night.\u201d I had the map, I had the compass and every night we went to another village there around the woods. Not far. And we walked in, and the Pollack went with us, one of them and one went with the other. And they knocked on the window in the night and they said, \"We are fighters for Poland,\" into the windows because people were scared. They woke up in the middle of the night and there's people with \u2014 with rifles or whatever. Nobody had a rifle. Nobody nothing. You know what we did. We took some wood and we put it on, on a string and I had a pistol. And I speak very good Polish and I was always the speaker for them and I came over and I said \u2014 because most of our Jews, they didn't speak a good Polish. They spoke Yiddish most of them and half Russian because their guys were the other side, but I spoke Polish, I went to school. And I came over and I said, \"I'm fighting for Poland for, for your freedom. We don't want nothing from you. Just give us some food and we will go away. Some milk, bread.\u201d We were always taking some bread for the people for another 11 people back. And that was happening every night we were going to another village and until we exhausted already around this, we said, \"Let's go somewhere else.\u201d And we start moving. And then Pollacks then too said, \"Listen, you cannot walk around like this, rifles without on you. They will kill us. Any day the \u2014 the farmers will tell the Nazis or somebody and they will kill us all.\u201d \"Give us \u2014 you have some money. You have some money or something? Give it to me and we will go out back to Lublin and we will buy some rifles or get some pistols or whatever.\u201d And they walked \u2014 they took everything what we had and they walked away from us. And I don't see them till today. I don't know what really happened. If they were caught or something like that, but we never heard from them. And then we were on our own.

            "question": "Okay, Mr. Gruber, you brought us to the point where there were 22 of you, who had gone into the forest with the two Polish partisans. You told us that the partisans then took your money, your belongings, left, went back into the city and \u2014 never to be seen again. This left you with 21 other men. Could you tell us about what your thoughts were when you saw yourself there with 22 \u2014 21 other men, facing an unknown situation?",
            "answer": "It was a very, very hard situation, we \u2014 also we were already on the last few days in the woods. But still we relied more or less on the Polish two guys, when they came over to the farmers, they helped with this. Because the farmers, we knew, didn\u2019t like Jews specifically. That\u2019s why I changed my name to Mietek, this is a real Polish \u2014 Mieczyslaw and short is Mietek. And almost every one of our group took a Polish name, that they shouldn\u2019t \u2014 also we talked Yiddish between ourself and we, we were a Jewish group, almost everybody knew, but we didn\u2019t want to be so obvious in dealings with the farmers to say that Jews. And they always had that imagination that a Jews is not a soldier, a Jew doesn\u2019t know what a rifle is, a Jew doesn\u2019t \u2014 he\u2019s different than all of them. The difference what meant a lot, that they, they \u2014 some of them they didn\u2019t see a Jew, but they told them the story about this. Then, this reminds me when I was in Germany. One day they took me to a farmer to work in the farm and when they came time to lunch they took me home and I was sitting by the table and there was a young girl, a German girl. And I was talking fluently German, I spoke to her, and she spoke to me, and I saw she likes me, she\u2019s talks to me. Then she starts talking about Jews, \u201cBecause of the Jews the war broke out. Because of the Jews the \u2014 this, this, this.\u201d I asked her a plain question, \u201cDid you ever saw a Jew?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I never saw.\u201d I said, \u201cHow you know what it 1s?\u201d She said \u201cHitler said that they are killer, that they are this, this, this. And they have horns,\u201d she said, \u201cthey have horns. Jews have horns.\u201d I said, \u201cListen darling, I am a Jews and I have no horns.\u201d She almost died. I couldn't believe it, what kind of faces she made then and she \u2014 she ran out from the house and she was so excited and so this \u2014 and she came back and said, \"You are lying to me. That's impossible,\" she said. \u201cYou couldn't be it.\u201d I was a good looking young fellow in a uniform and she couldn't believe it. And that was the, the image of the Jews. It was only \u2014 they didn't know even, who a Jew is. But the image of a Jew was, for them, something that \u2014 terrific, was with horns or some devil or something a Jew is not a normal person.

It made so much noise that we didn't know that it was a wounded animal or something like that or a human being or something and one of our people jumped up to the tree and he cut it off and he showed that was only a tree making the noise. But we were really scared. We didn't know what, what to expect there. You don't know where you are. In fact, we really didn't know where we were because not far from us maybe a mile or two, were Germans living. There they had a garrison. They lived there, and they were watching their mill. There was there a big one. But we didn't know. We didn't know for nothing. We were just came in there and, and we were doing our job, going every night and back and forth. And it's good that we decided to go away because the farmers start talking and the Germans would find out fast, and they would kill us. 02:08:03 Then we went away and after a night, or two nights\u2014 I don't remember exactly how it was \u2014 by walking from one place to the other, only by map.

That was our \u2014 I don't know why, but we took over the \u2014 a leader was in the front, and the soldiers were behind. Here I think is the other way around. I remember in the army it was the other, other way. The officer was in the back and the soldiers were going in the front. I remember in the war, the old officers were in the back and the soldiers were in the front. Then here we changed it. I was always in the lead. I had to go in the front. Wherever you went, I had always with me let's say a Bleichman or another one, what knew the terrain and I was in the front, going and they were after me. That's what we was scared stiff. Every night when you go, you don't know what will happen. Who will shoot or who will do something to you, you understand? You didn't know if you will meet Pollacks what are against you \u2014 I'm sorry. One second. I don't know what happen. All of a sudden, some food or whatever. But you had to do it. You cannot tell the people that you are afraid. You had to go. You had to lead. And it was like a army. We got orders, you know, to burn down this and this village. And we did it. Next, we had this group of our people went out for food one night, a separate group, small, and on the way back some Polish people called over two of them what they knew them by name. Morel, and the other one I don't remember. Morel and the Pollacks, young boys from the same town where this Jew was, called him over, said, \u201cMorel, come over here.\u201d And he had a machine gun this guy and they called him over. It didn't took long and they killed them, both of them. The Pollacks. And the rest of this group, was maybe four or five came running to us in the middle of the night.

Came over at night from one corner to the other. But one thing we didn't, we didn't kill the people. We told them to run out before we went from one place to the other. We had straw and as we had other, I think gasoline a little, I think, we took, too, petroleum or something we had. We pour a little bit match and burned the whole village.

I was \u2014 by the way, I was writing almost everything what I went through by the day. I had a paper, a book with me, paper and a pencil and I was writing down almost everything what happened. But I will tell you later what happened to it. And I wrote them a leaflet like that said, \"You see what you're doing. You kill our people. We have to kill you. We didn't come to fight with you. We want to fight the Germans, and I think you supposed to help us and not going against us and on top of this to kill our people.\u201d I left notes and left this. Then we had a case like this. We were in a farm house. And a Polish man there which lived there went to the Germans, and he told them. The Germans came and somehow we, we were always soldiers. That's what's good for us because we were watching. We had a watch outside, a watch inside. If we were sleeping, was still was a watch. One or two was watching. I was on the watch there outside and I see a lineup of Germans coming. It was on a hill. We were in a house and downstairs, down below the Germans are coming. I woke up everyone of us, put on \u2014 we had to \u2014 we start running out from the house because when they came to a house near that's it. Nobody could get out because they threw like we did. Straw or something and they start shooting with fire, ammunition, and they burned down the houses and they burned down the people there. We ran out and we run away a whole day, we had to fight with the Germans. We ran, shoot back, run and shoot back. No one of our people was killed there in this skirmish. In the night, the Germans disappeared. They left us alone. We went back to this village, and we went to the house where this happened where we left, left the house and we said, \"What's going on?\" The man wasn't there already and the son wasn't there and we start asking people. They said, \"The son went to the Germans and he told them that we are there.\u201d So, \"Good. We will stay there and watching.\u201d And all of a sudden I see there a young, a youngster walks and I called him over, say, \"Who are you?\" He said, \"Oh, I didn't want to.

Of course, a man like this if he goes report the Germans, he's a spy already against us. This is nothing. Then we took him out in the outskirts and start beating him up. He was screaming there. Then one of our people saw that he screams too loud, took out the rifle and they killed him. I was sorry that they killed him, but still it was coming to him. When he killed him \u2014 he shot him it made a noise. The shot and the Germans were not far, and they start shooting at us and they started, but it was night and we just got away.

Every one of our Jewish people were a leader himself. They knew a lot you know. They are not dummies. Everyone of them, and to be a leader by Jews, you really have to have guts and you have to have patience and you have to have \u2014 I don't know what \u2014 to be a leader, but this is no jokes.

Only Szengut was the guy what \u2014 but he looked so Jewish and so Yiddish he couldn't, he couldn't represent us you know. It was \u2014 we had to push him a little bit on the side. Now, we established our presence in the neighborhood, but we felt we couldn't stay too long in the neighborhood. They told us not to stay, and we didn't. We felt \u2014 because we exhausted \u2014 I came twice \u2014 three times to the same farmer. He didn't have what to eat himself to watch this, and we had to go farther. Then I decided to go with the group of 10 people to find out \u2014 because they were talking about other groups on the other side of the Bug. We were \u2014 there was \u2014 when you see the map, there was a, a \u2014 this river, Wieprz, is the name \u2014 Wieprz and the next was the Bug. The Bug was the border from Poland and Russia already later. But we were between the Wieprz and the Bug later. In the beginning, we were on the other side of the Wieprz. We had to cross. And we crossed over the Wieprz and we knew that between the Wieprz and Bug 1s a group \u2014 1s groups, partisans there that we heard about. You know they told us, the farmers. There was no telephones, but we heard that. 02:41:10 We had connections all the time. This Genek, his connections was saving us always. We knew when the Germans going out from Lublin with a expedition of something, we knew about it. They told us. The farmers, one told the other and they told us. We had the connections. We had this. And only with connections we could live through. We were laughing already there when I was going sometimes in the night. I laughed and said what group 1s going again that meetings to get a connection then. I felt that is the way to be because when you are a group, you live by yourself, and you don't know \u2014 no telephones, nothing. You don't know what's going to come next, and they were spying. You have to have this. You have to know what your neighbor's doing. You have to know what's going on, and you have to know the other groups. You have to know what's in the, what's going on in the country or in Russia. We knew about politics. We knew everything was in the front. This in the front. This we knew everything what's going on. I was reading papers. I was seeing everything clearly. Otherwise, we couldn't live. It was impossible. Of course, a lot of groups were \u2014 a lot of Jews run away, and they didn't have the organization. They didn't have the connections and they disappeared. They disappeared. The Pollacks killed them themselves or somehow the Germans \u2014 they told the Germans. They disappeared. Disappeared group by group disappeared. And I went through this Wieprz. There was a whole story how we went through that. And we came over on the other side, and I was so tired. Unbelievably tired. And I was sorry that I brought them people on the other side because we were walking two days and two nights. We didn't know where we are going. Completely! We were \u2014 like I say, I didn't have the connection. I didn't have the people around me. The neighborhood there I knew already. I knew where I'm going. And here I didn't know nothing. And we walked over to a farm, and we woke up a woman there and she start screaming and crying, \"Please don't do this.\u201d I said, \"Don't worry. We will not do nothing to you. Just let us in.\u201d She said, \"No, I can't because I have a child 1s sick. Very sick. He had typhus or something and you will catch it too. Don't go in.\u201d Said, \"Okay, we will go in the barn.\u201d We went in the barn. We were dead. We were so tired of walking.

And I lay down in the, the barn and all our people. We always kept one men to watch and all of a sudden maybe it was day already. I wake up and I see nobody's watching. Nobody! I woke up, and I was a very sleeper \u2014 I, I could hear everything always when sleep. I don't know why. This was nature or something. I could hear everything. Whatever happened in sleep always, I could hear it. Then I walked over \u2014 I woked up, I went over to the door to the barn and I see, all of a sudden, I see Germans, Polish uniforms, the police, and farmers and the whole posse but still forming, still going. 02:44:37 And I woke up my people very fast. And we walked out with the front and shooting at them. They were not still organized. They were still starting something then, and we start shooting at them. And walked around the barn, and we start running away. Because they were an army there. Who knows how many? I didn't know. And we start running, running and we \u2014 I see very bad. There's no trees, nothing. We are only a few houses there, and it is a field. They have a good field for us to shoot us when we running. They can shoot everybody. And little by little we start moving away, moving away and all of a sudden, I see one guy fall beside and then I see another one fall. They were not dead. Just one was shot in the foot, and one was somewhere else shot and he said, \"Please take my rifle. I am dead. They will kill me anyway.\u201d I said, \"I don't need your rifle. I have mine.\u201d I couldn't do nothing. Then all of a sudden I feel a shot. It was my finger here. I have still the finger here like this, shot here right here. I squeezed my hand. I see blood. Yes, I took out, I don't know, a handkerchief or something. I put it on. I didn't make a big deal of it. I was walking, walking. All of a sudden I feel a shot in my foot, in my leg. Yeah, right here. Through. And I cannot walk no more. I cannot walk. I was trying you know. Szengut right behind me, and he start pulling me. He said, \"You have to walk.\u201d In the meantime, the rest of the people \u2014 we were about 10 or 12 \u2014 start moving. You know, they cannot wait for me. They see this one 1s laying, another is laying, and he, he didn't leave me alone. He starts pulling me, and I start walking and walking. I see I still can walk. The bone wasn't touched. And this was luck. It was just the meat here that was shot here. And I could walk. It was bleeding a little bit, but I still walked. 02:47:17 And we run over to a house there and we told the farmer, \"Fast put on a horse and wagon,\u2019 Szengut said, \u201cand we will put on \u2014 I will put you down on this on the wagon and we will start running away with this.\u201d Then all of a sudden I see the Germans right by the border there when I was, I was there. They came out. And one starts talking Polish to me. And he says in Polish, \"You're a Jew, bastard?\" or something, this. And he aimed with a rifle this, and he didn't, I don't know, he didn't hit me. I got up and Szengut grabbed me and left the horse with the wagon, and I start screaming with my people. I start screaming with my people, they rest, \"Stop and start shooting back. Start shooting back because otherwise nobody will live.\u201d And I remember like today this one of them guys, it was Andrejew. He was the first one. He turned around, took out the rifle, he was aiming at the Germans. The Germans stopped. They stopped. Right away they fell through the floor. And when he took out a few of our people. There was a Finkel there This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They took out the rifles and they start shooting back. When they stopped the Germans, I had time to with Szengut to run away to come over and we went over to a woods somewhere there around not far, and the Germans stopped a little bit behind and they had three of our people and I think they, they killed there because I know \u2014 don't know what happened to them again. And between them was this Majdanek, this guy what run away from Majdanek. He was killed there right away in this skirmish. And I run away to the woods. In the meantime, Szengut and another one, Finkel, they both went back to look. Maybe they can help somebody to \u2014 they came to a farmhouse and they opened the door there, and when they opened the door Germans was sitting there. A whole bunch of them was sitting there, and they were singing or eating something. You know they, they had that trophy. They took away \u2014 I think they took away some money from these three guys too. They had maybe a few \u2014 I don't know what kind money. And Finkel closed the door and Szengut had hand grenade and they threw in there the hand grenade into this, and they don't know what happened there. Then they run away, and they found me. I was still waiting. 02:50:12 And we took a farmer, stopped with a horse and wagon on this \u2014 put me on this and they sat down and I was with Szengut and another one and they had another \u2014 they stopped other farmers when they \u2014 on the way and we start moving. And on the way I asked the farmer, \"Maybe you will take me home because I am shot and I cannot \u2014 my finger start bothering me very much, more than the foot.\u201d I said, \"I cannot walk and I cannot, I cannot function.\u201d He said, \"You have to be helped.\u201d I said, \"Oh no, my wife is sick and there's a \u2014 I'm afraid, but I will bring you over. I have a farm and I have a man what works for me, and he will keep you. He will keep you there.\u201d I said, \"Alright, whatever he wanted to do.\u201d And he brought me over to another farmer and the farmer was very nice to me. They, they took a Band-Aid and they, they took some water. I don't know what kind of water. They washed it and they cleaned it very, very nice. They, they helped me out. It took almost a half a day, something, I was there sitting. All of a sudden, shooting again. I was with Szengut, and another Piasecki was another guy. We were there in the partition there. The rest of the group was in another house. Start shooting in the house. Like a thunder. Shoot directly in the house. And the farmer showed me the way out in the back and me and Piasecki. I got up and I said, \"Where is Henryk?\u201d I said, \"Where is Finkel?\u201d And I start looking back and I don't see him. And the farmer said, \"You cannot wait a second. Run. Run.\u201d And from the back of the farm it was already start to be a little darkish and I run away with Piasecki, this guy. We run away both of us. And with my wounded foot then I had to walk a whole night. I was walking in the woods. Walking, walking, walking. It was day almost. I went over. I had no, no choice already. I didn't know what to do myself. I walked over to a farmer. \u201cYou should help me something or give me a piece of bread or something.\u201d And I came over to the farm.

He was the only one there that knew something. There was another one later on. But he \u2014 he managed. He was there immediately. When we came down, he was happy. They really loved us, because we became soldiers. We became some kind of a army and together right away, we started on trains. This is how highways, trains, communications lines cut and we together. Big train, but river and it was a bridge. Thunder. We broke down the whole bridge, you know. It was on the border, the train. And the same time I was with another group, maybe a hundred people. There was children and women and all kinds of this there, and I found there. And I had to carry them too. And on the way, like I say, we were the first one always to go. I walked straight on a German with a rifle. And I walked them into the rifle. Imagine how that \u2014 how I felt. I stand still like a, like a dummy. I didn't know what to do.

We have a few hundred people and you be there. I see you are soldiers. You are in that group. You come to us.\u201d And that's what we were waiting for. And we came, the whole group came to Baranovskiy. And when we came to Baranovskiy, he took us in, he divided with us right away. \u201cNo more Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot be Jews. By a group you have to be separate. Every group, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, whatever it is. You cannot be Jews by themselves. This is our policy. And this is it. You can do that otherwise. Whatever you want, you have to be divided.\u201d In the meantime, he made me \u2014 and he made a group in Russian \u2014 Russian kept separate, and he made from Polish people, A.L. he called them. The are Armia Ludowa. He made a group, and I was \u2014 he made me the leader. From Pollacks and from Jews and I was the leader of them.

I have to send them over.\u201d \u201cHow you will do?\u201d \u201cI make a conference from all officers, Russian, Polish, anyone, and when I will say I have a mission and I need volunteers. Then you two get up fast because you knew already what to do. You get up, you two. When you are up that's it. I have to send you two.\u201d And we came to the meeting and sat and meantime at the meeting, there came a guy from Warsaw ghetto. He run away. He was a politician. He was \u2014 I think he was a communist, something like that. He was the political figure there. He said, \"I'm going, too, at this meeting.\u201d He goes to the meeting too. And he knows about us that have to get up and we're together and we sit three of us together and all of sudden, this General Baranovskiy says, \"I have to send out some people with papers and all this.
