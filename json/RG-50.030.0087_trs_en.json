And I went to school there, to the public school, for seven years we went. And the town was a very, very nice town. It was Podhajce \u2014 that mean, they had a lot of trees and water and people came from all over Poland almost for like a recreation. It was a very nice place. And I don't remember poor people there because usually in the towns, in the shtetel you call, there was a lot of poor people. I don't remember poor people there. Everybody had some kind of store or a business, a small one. My father was a builder. He came from another town and he was building in Podhajce, and he met my mother. My mother was a farmer's daughter, they had land, and he married her and I'm \u2014 all my life I was till 26 years, the war start \u2014 I was with my mother's family. I hardly knew my father's family. They were in another town, so it wasn't so easy to go from town to town like it is today. But still when I was 14 years old, I went away to Lemberg \u2014 Lwow, they called it \u2014 to a bigger town, and I went to high school there and I finished school."

And then I came back to Podhajce, to my family. And I had a job, was a bookkeeper, I worked in a big company from a farmer\u2019s equipment and bicycles, this kind of thing. I was a bookkeeper, there. I worked \u2014 till the war started, I worked there. I had a girlfriend. I went out with her for years before the war. And in 19\u2014I was a soldier before, too."

            "question": "Tell us about that. In what way were you a soldier?",
            "answer": "They took \u2014 they drafted. After 18 years \u2014 19 years, they drafted, and you had to go. And I was physically fit and they took me. Usually they didn't took Jews. Very, few Jews they took to the army, but I was fitting and I had school, and they took me to the army. And I was one and a half years in Tarnopol in the army and I finished the army I came home again and I was working back again in the job. And in \u201839 before the war started, maybe a month, the town was small and we knew each other. A lot of friends. We were always talking politics on the streets and what will be, what will be, about Hitler came in \u201833 and we knew what was going on. The Pollacks were already showing their faces too. They didn't \u2014 so much the Pollacks like the Ukraine, there were very few Pollacks there. But the Ukrainians there, they showed us that we are Jews, and they are \u2014 we had fights with them. Not big ones, not killings, but fists fights and all kind of \u2014 I remember one Purim where we made some kind of a party and a Pollack came and he wanted to disturb this. And I had a big fight with him and he almost killed me because he was very big. I didn't give him an inch, I just gave him back. But he never forgot me this guy. He came after a few days after me. He almost killed me. Around the house he was waiting for me. At least, we had our share with this antisemitism. We did not feel so much in with Podhajce, like we felt in Lemberg. We felt it more in the bigger towns. They were they called it Endeks!. There was a group of Pollacks, the right wing and they were completely against the Jews and they were even killing before the war break. We had a big fight with them on the streets in the gardens and whatever \u2014 it was a street like in Akademicka. That remind me today somebody. Jews couldn't walk there. And there was the biggest houses belonged to Jews and there was a guy \u2014 Stricher(ph) was his name \u2014 he had this biggest house like on Akademicka street. He couldn't even collect the rent there. He couldn't go over because the antisemitism was so big and they couldn't \u2014 they were almost sitting in the streets daring, waiting for Jews to come and to beat them up. The situation before the war was already ripe for this, but like a like \u2014 the churchman said ' National Democrats (Polish); abbreviated from \u201cEndecja.\u201d in Poland, \u201cBoycotting is all right, the Jews. Beating them up, 1s alright. But not killing. Killing is not our aim,\u201d the Catholic church."

            "answer": "That's right. Before the war, they called me over on the reserves. Maybe two or three weeks before the war started. They called me to Nowy Sacz, a town not far from the borders of Germany. It is not far from Przemysl and Tarnow. And they \u2014 I went to the army. They, they put us in uniforms and we started to exercise. And maybe two weeks after, nobody new about this. Nobody \u2014 the people around there was surrounded there. Zakopane was a place where people came there for a cure. And nobody knew that the war started and all of a sudden during the night they starting shooting and they left us behind, the Germans, and they moved in. It was a Blitzkrieg. They moved in before we even knew what happen. We were in the army. We were sitting in the mountains because there was a lot of mountains, the Carpathian Mountains. And we were sitting there and waiting for the Germans and they were around us already, deep in, in Poland and we didn't know they were around us. But after a time they started with us too because they did it in pockets like, and they start fighting with us and I was wounded in my right arm. I was shot and I fell, and but they didn't see me, and I walked over to a house there to a Polish woman and I begged her to let me in because I was bleeding and she saw me and she was crying. She was afraid, but she took me in and she start helping me and she bandaged my wound and I was laying \u2014 when I was laying there for five minutes the Germans came in. And screaming and looking, and the one with the pistol came over to me and I spoke fluently German. I told him, \u201cI'm a soldier and I, I'm wounded.\u201d He said, \"Okay, don't worry. We will take you back to the hospital.\u201d And they gave me something to eat even there because they took from the farm woman and gave it to me and they brought me back to the hospital."

Nobody bothered me specially as a Jew. Nobody said nothing to me. But the Polish people and the woman that worked there, they knew about it that I am Jewish, but they didn't make a special\u2014"

And I was lying there maybe a month in the hospital until I could move my right hand. I couldn't move it, but they helped me out a little bit and I'm, I'm moving it. I still till today is \u2014 I cannot pick my hand that's all. And after a month and a half, they took us, whoever was in the hospital left, and they took us to Germany. In a train, they brought me over to Germany. And they brought me into Stalag 13 \u20141n the film you will see, Stalag 13 \u2014 as a prisoner of war. The second day I came in, they put us 1n a line up, all the Polish prisoners and they asked, \u201cJuden raustreten\u2019.\u201d \"Jews report.\u201d I was hesitating for a minute, I admit and two friends of mine, Pollacks, they were standing in my side both of them and they pushed me out and they said, \"Here is a Jew.\u201d"

I had no, no choice, and they put a separate barracks but to the same place they kept us. They took us to all kinds of work, heavy work during this. We were cleaning after even Hitler when he spoke in Nuremberg. That was \u2014 I was around Nur\u2014Langwasser, Stalag 13 was there. Nuremberg, we were cleaning after Hitler. He spoke once. And I was a little bit more home in the barracks because I couldn't work so hard with my hand and they knew about it the Germans. They had their report. And in fact, the Red Cross came to us and my number's 30,189. I still remember.

            "answer": "That's a very interesting. My family was on the other side of the border. The Russians took over one side of Poland. The Germans took over the other. They had made pact, Ribbentrop\u00ae and Molotov\u2019, and they divided Poland. My family was in Galicia, and then belonged to Russian and I was on the other side by the Germans and they were by the Russians. So 1941 they were under the Russian. It wasn't too good, but still my father was working. He was a builder and he built houses for them, and he built this. And he \u2014 they made a living. Nobody killed him there. They knew what is going on the other side, because I was corresponding with them. As a prisoner of war, I had the right to write \u2014 to send letters and they were receiving the letters and they were answering me. And one was an interesting that I sent a letter that went from one camp to the other when they took me. I was in a few camps. But they cut my hair. I had very nice bushy hair and I didn't like it that they cut my hair. I looked like a muselman\u2019. I looked very bad. Then I wrote to my * Jews step out! (German) 3 Joachim von Ribbentrop * Vyacheslav Molotov > Muslim (German); camp term used to refer to prisoners who had lost the will to live and were near death. parents that they cut my hair again and my sister answers me, \"Watch that they shouldn't cut your head. The hair will grow back.\u201d And that was the truth. I had to watch my head."

And after a time, there were SO many insects in this that when I took it over, the sweater walked away by itself. That's a joke, that's the truth. That's the way it was. I mean I had contact with my sister and I had contact with my family."

            "question": "Okay. Now, let's get back to where you were. You were taken into Stalag and you were given a particular work assignment?",
            "answer": "I was assigned to the kitchen more or less because in the beginning, they did some other works and later on they put me in the kitchen. In the kitchen, I was making coffee and I was making lunch. And I once I made coffee and I didn't know what sugar is. They gave me the salt and sugar was for me the same. I never saw it before. And you had to \u2014 sugar was in lumps not loose. And I put in ..instead of sugar, I put in salt in the coffee in the morning, the group went to work, was Pollacks also, they were eating from this kitchen. They wanted to kill me because the coffee was salted and they figured \u2014 they called me in the Germans right away and they said it's sabotage and usually when \u2014 if I would be under the SS, I wouldn't live. They would kill me. But this was Wehrmacht\u00ae there. And some of them are still people today you could talk to. And I understand. told him this story that I didn't know what it is and I put in salt. And he let me go. But he gave me a lesson. I think he took me, he put me to work, but he was somehow lenient to me because I helped him out after a time in his office too. I write German fluently, and I was helping in the office to write it. And from \u2014 this was in Ludwigsburg, I think, yes. I was in Nuremberg, and then I was in Ludwigsburg and then I was in what the name? Munzinger. They were taking us from one place to the other. And then Munzinger, all of a sudden they decided or it's not \u2014 they, I mean, the headquarters \u2014 decided that all Jews have to be sent back to Poland. How\u201d? They said they don't want prisoners now. The Pollacks \u2014 the Polish war was finished. Why should they keep prisoners? \u201cYou are Jews, and no, no prisoners and we send you home.\u201d And they suppose to change, to change us over with the Russians. That was in \u201841, and after a time they took us \u2014 they put us in trains and they brought us to Gleiwitz and from Gleiwitz, they brought us to Lublin in a camp Lipowa Seven. There was from horses from a camp before. And this Lipowa, right away by the train, when they took us over, they showed us, right away, who they are. They \u00b0 General title of German armed forces from 1935 to 1945. were SS. They came with, with the dogs, peitsches\u2019, sticks and all kinds of this, and they were beating us right all the way to the camp. And they told, \"You are no more prisoners of war. You are Jews and we will be treated as Jews.\u201d But still they kept us separate. They didn't put us together with the ghetto. There was a ghetto. In Lublin there was a ghetto already then. And they did not put us in the ghetto. But there was an interesting story. Before I came there was maybe a thousand prisoners. They were all Jews also, what came and they \u2014 the Germans brought them over to the Jews from the ghetto and they told them, \"You feed them. That's your Jews. You feed them.\u201d And they, they didn't have what to eat themselves in Lublin. The people, the population was very bad for the ghetto. And they said, \"We don't have food.\u201d They said, \"Good.\u201d They took them out and they killed all the prisoners of war, the whole thousand. Maybe \u2014 maybe a tenth was left over by the end. They brought them on the way to Lubartow, a small town, and then to Parczew. Maybe there was left maybe 10, maybe 20. I don't \u2014 I cannot tell exactly and there the people \u2014 the population, the Jewish population put them in right away and gave them food and they kept. I came after this and they felt that the Jews \u2014 they felt they had to do something. They made a kitchen for us in the camp. They brought over and they was cooking for us meals, and they kept us there. The leadership there was from the SS. There was Riedel\u00ae was the leader, and there was Dolp\u2019 was a small officer. He was the terror of all Lublin and the terror from all over in Poland. Dolp was known all over. Dolp came in on a horse to the camp and if he saw somebody laying in the bed sick or somebody didn't get up so fast in the morning, he shot him right on the spot. And we had a lot of problems there in the camp. I was still on the, on the care of this hospital whatever because I was shot and I had always showed this paper I had from the Germans that I cannot work so hard. Others were working out and in the beginning also I went out to work and we built the known Majdanek camp, Majdanek concentration camp. They built from the prisoners of war. We built it. And after this was ready, we were still there. They brought in the first prisoners of war from Russia. The war with Russia started in 1941. I think in July, June. I don't remember exactly the date. And when the war started the first prisoners of war in Majdanek were Russians and they said \u2014 the Germans said that they are not Russians \u2014 just prisoners, but they are commissars. They are officers something like communists real, and they have to die. And they were dying like flies. I don't know if they gave them poison or whatever they gave them, they were dying. They had typhus there and they were dying. And we got \u2014 we caught from them typhus from the Russians. Me too. I got sick. I got the typhus. And they brought \u2014 they didn't want to give us any care because they were afraid that we will \u2014 they will get sick to the Germans, and they took us out and they put us in a synagogue. In the synagogue they put on the floor nothing to cover. Nothing. We just stayed there. We were about 400 sick people and I think 300 died. And the strongest one, somehow \u2014 I cannot believe it, but the stronger ones died. And I had some help from the town 7 Whips (German) * Unterscharf Horst Riedel ? Sturmbannfihrer Hermann Dolp somehow. A doctor came in once, and he knew me from before. And he gave me a needle and he ran out fast because he was afraid that everybody want and he didn't have the help for everybody. And he gave me a needle and somehow it helped me, and I lived too."

I remember today that I was always digging in into this, why there is antisemitism all around. Why the church? Why this? Why they're doing this? And I was always working on this. And people were asking me always the questions about this. Why there is antisemitism? And I told once a story and I don't know why it came to me the story. I was reading it or something that men \u2014 a priest asked a man to come into his church. He didn't see him a long time in the church. He said, \"Why should I go to the church. You always talk nonsense?\" He said, \"No, no. Come over. I will have a very nice sermon. Come over.\u201d The man came out. The churchman talks as a sermon about Jews. He said that the Jews killed Christ. The Jews need blood for matzos and all the bad things in the world comes from the Jews. He heard a sermon against the Jews. The Pollack walked out and he grabbed a Jew on the street. They start beating him up. Then the church man came out, the priest came out and said, \"Why do you beat this Jew?\" He said, \"What do you mean why I am beating?\" You just told me what the Jews did. They killed Christ and, and all kinds of things.\u201d He said, \"Wait a second. That was 2000 years ago. That was a long time ago.\u201d He said, \"No, \" to the priest. \"You told it to me today and while you talking about this, we are listening.\u201d And that's what it was. They were listening to the priest. The priest were always talking about this, that Jews are a menace. \u201cThe Jews killed Christ.\u201d But they never told them that Christ was a Jew himself. In Poland if you would tell a '0'Youth guard (Hebrew); Zionist youth organization. 'l Training (Hebrew); Zionist program to prepare youth for emigration to Israel. Pollack that Jesus was a Jew, he would kill you it. Because how can it be? He was God. And that came from the churches. It came this hate for the Jews. Next the economic situation in Poland was so that Jews were working for the big farmers. Jews were working for the kings. Jews were working, collecting taxes. That was their function. And by doing this they came in contact with the nation, with the people."

The Pollacks are not so keen to see us, and here 1s at least they give us some food. They gave us some cover to sleep in the night.

It wasn't right away. I was finding out if he tells the truth and how he behaves and all this. I was watching very carefully. And we made a meeting in town. I had a meeting with him and two real partisans. People from the woods came over and in a restaurant, a Jewish restaurant \u2014 it was still a Jewish restaurant in the ghetto, and he gave me a compass. He gave me a map, and he gave me directions and where to run and how to run and where to meet. And we run away on October the 28th, 1942. We decided to run away. We talked to these 22 people. Everyone of them knew their locations, where he was to go. In separate places there everybody had to go. The going was still good. That means we could get out somehow. We could persuade the Germans we have to go out because later on I know after this nobody could get out. But it was still a possibility to get out of at least to town you know, to\u2014"

All the mail what we sent home or wherever went through a censor and my letter I gave to a Polish girl and she took it with her, and somehow, they caught the Polish girl with my letter.

The \u2014 Dolp didn't like how he worked and they started beating him up. This Jewish boy threw himself on this Dolp and start fighting with him, fist fighting. He fought with him, but he had a pistol or something and he hit him, the Jewish boy. And he started bleeding and they took him, and interesting, they didn't kill him. They took him away to a hospital, and they kept him there. The Germans kept him there for a long time until he healed. When he was healed, they took him out and Dolp said, \"He's mine.\u201d He told him, \"Run away now in the field.\u201d He told him, \"Run.\u201d He ran and, and he killed him.

It is not a partisans, I have no idea what it is. And when we came these two guys start leading us, starting showing us what to do, how to do. And the first thing we went through a water. We had to , a Small river and we had to take off the shoes and they showed us how to cross and by one by one we crossed the water and we came on the other side. And then they brought us over to a place in the woods, deep in the woods and he said \u2014 there was not far a river \u2014 and he said, \"Here we will make a camp. In the night \u2014 we will go every night,\u201d we were 22 people, \u201cOn \u2014 11 under your leadership and the other 11 going with...,\u201d Kaganowicz was the other guy \u2014 he was a leader too. \u201cWe will go \u2014 11 people we will go into the farmers in the night.\u201d I had the map, I had the compass and every night we went to another village there around the woods.

They woke up in the middle of the night and there's people with \u2014 with rifles or whatever. Nobody had a rifle. Nobody nothing. You know what we did. We took some wood and we put it on, on a string and I had a pistol. And I speak very good Polish and I was always the speaker for them and I came over and I said \u2014 because most of our Jews, they didn't speak a good Polish. They spoke Yiddish most of them and half Russian because their guys were the other side, but I spoke Polish, I went to school. And I came over and I said, \"I'm fighting for Poland for, for your freedom. We don't want nothing from you. Just give us some food and we will go away.

And that was happening every night we were going to another village and until we exhausted already around this, we said, \"Let's go somewhere else.\u201d And we start moving. And then Pollacks then too said, \"Listen, you cannot walk around like this, rifles without on you. They will kill us. Any day the \u2014 the farmers will tell the Nazis or somebody and they will kill us all.\u201d \"Give us \u2014 you have some money. You have some money or something?

            "question": "Okay, Mr. Gruber, you brought us to the point where there were 22 of you, who had gone into the forest with the two Polish partisans. You told us that the partisans then took your money, your belongings, left, went back into the city and \u2014 never to be seen again. This left you with 21 other men. Could you tell us about what your thoughts were when you saw yourself there with 22 \u2014 21 other men, facing an unknown situation?",
            "answer": "It was a very, very hard situation, we \u2014 also we were already on the last few days in the woods. But still we relied more or less on the Polish two guys, when they came over to the farmers, they helped with this. Because the farmers, we knew, didn\u2019t like Jews specifically. That\u2019s why I changed my name to Mietek, this is a real Polish \u2014 Mieczyslaw and short is Mietek. And almost every one of our group took a Polish name, that they shouldn\u2019t \u2014 also we talked Yiddish between ourself and we, we were a Jewish group, almost everybody knew, but we didn\u2019t want to be so obvious in dealings with the farmers to say that Jews. And they always had that imagination that a Jews is not a soldier, a Jew doesn\u2019t know what a rifle is, a Jew doesn\u2019t \u2014 he\u2019s different than all of them. The difference what meant a lot, that they, they \u2014 some of them they didn\u2019t see a Jew, but they told them the story about this. Then, this reminds me when I was in Germany. One day they took me to a farmer to work in the farm and when they came time to lunch they took me home and I was sitting by the table and there was a young girl, a German girl. And I was talking fluently German, I spoke to her, and she spoke to me, and I saw she likes me, she\u2019s talks to me. Then she starts talking about Jews, \u201cBecause of the Jews the war broke out. Because of the Jews the \u2014 this, this, this.\u201d I asked her a plain question, \u201cDid you ever saw a Jew?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I never saw.\u201d I said, \u201cHow you know what it 1s?\u201d She said \u201cHitler said that they are killer, that they are this, this, this. And they have horns,\u201d she said, \u201cthey have horns. Jews have horns.\u201d I said, \u201cListen darling, I am a Jews and I have no horns.\u201d She almost died. I couldn't believe it, what kind of faces she made then and she \u2014 she ran out from the house and she was so excited and so this \u2014 and she came back and said, \"You are lying to me. That's impossible,\" she said. \u201cYou couldn't be it.\u201d I was a good looking young fellow in a uniform and she couldn't believe it. And that was the, the image of the Jews. It was only \u2014 they didn't know even, who a Jew is. But the image of a Jew was, for them, something that \u2014 terrific, was with horns or some devil or something a Jew is not a normal person. That is what they \u2014"

Then, when we exhausted the neighborhood, we started moving away from there. But before we moved, we had a problem. We had a boy with us from Majdanek, and this boy run away from Majdanek in a special way.

They covered him up because it was cold already in October. And we kept him like this and from himself, he got better and we were waiting for him to get better. In meantime, we were 22 people, and three of our people said, \"That's enough.\u201d They don't want to go run like this. \u201cIt is no use. They will kill all of us, and it's very hard life.

Everybody has his own mind, and it was very hard. The beginning was so hard it's unbelievable. I was really scared. I didn't know where I am. When I came in, I saw the woods. It, it was a special wind blowing from the woods with a noise, the Pollack said, \"Here, this will be your home now.\u201d To walk in into this, and it was dark when we walked in into the woods and in the woods, it was \u2014 the animals were making a lot of noise and it \u2014 and I came from a, from a town, nothing \u2014 a village and it was scary. And one of them trees was something broken. It made so much noise that we didn't know that it was a wounded animal or something like that or a human being or something and one of our people jumped up to the tree and he cut it off and he showed that was only a tree making the noise. But we were really scared. We didn't know what, what to expect there. You don't know where you are. In fact, we really didn't know where we were because not far from us maybe a mile or two, were Germans living. There they had a garrison. They lived there, and they were watching their mill. There was there a big one. But we didn't know. We didn't know for nothing. We were just came in there and, and we were doing our job, going every night and back and forth. And it's good that we decided to go away because the farmers start talking and the Germans would find out fast, and they would kill us. Then we went away and after a night, or two nights\u2014 I don't remember exactly how it was \u2014 by walking from one place to the other, only by map. Only by a compass and a map. We didn't ask nobody. In the night all of a sudden we hear noises in the woods and we stopped, and start looking, what kind of noises, voices. We heard something like Yiddish, spoken and I said, \"This is something.\u201d And we over near one or two of us, the rest was standing on the side, and we start screaming, \"amkha'*.\" Means \u201cyour people.\u201d And right away from the other side answered voice, \"amkha.\u201d And to our amazing we found a whole group of people who had run away from a village. This was maybe \u2014 they called a town Markuszow, what they called it, a village Markuszow. The whole town of there was maybe 100 people or whatever run away from this camp. And they all came to the woods. And there were ladies and men and children, a camp. And between them were two Russian prisoners of war who had run away also from a camp, from a prisoners of war camp. They run away from a Russian camp. They run away. One was Kolka \u2014 one was Mikoi\u2014 Tolka, Tolka, and Mikoi, was the two men there. One was a officer and the other was a sergeant or something from the Russian army. And when they saw us\u2014 we came in uniforms, we were all in uniforms from the prisoner of war \u2014 oh, he got so excited and he \u2014 they took us over and he start talking and we looked around and we saw they were building bunkers. You know what a bunker is? They were building in the land \u2014 they were building some hiding places there, and they put up trees or grass. They covered everything and they were living down in this hiding place."

And when it was raining, rain came in \u2014 still not all the way, but 1t came in still someway. When I saw this, I said, \"No, not for me. I didn't come in here to, to, to lay in \u2014 then the Germans will come in, and it's very easy to get all of us.\u201d And I said, \"No. I will not stay here.\u201d And I told this Tolka and said, \"It's not for me.\u201d He said, \"If you want to stay.\u201d He said, \"I have children and I have women. I have people. Where will \u2014 what will I do with them?\" They have to be placed somewhere and hidden. They said, \"Okay, we will be around you and we will work with you.\u201d But then he says, \"Please, give me somebody what is a soldier and discipline he knows because all of them come from towns and they're children and they don't know what army is, what soldiers is, what it is. Give me a few people of yours.\u201d And they will '8 Your people (Hebrew) teach, start learning them the skill of the army. And I said, \"Okay.\u201d And I left Jegier, Cygan, I remember the name, and the woman Gottlieb(ph) her name, three or four I left with Tolka. And they were, they were starting working with him. I went away. But we kept contact all the time. We \u2014 through other farmers \u2014 how it happened, Tolka had already connections. He came to a town, Garbow and in this town was a man. His name was Kaminski, Genek Kaminski. This was a known and this Genek was something what we have to thank a lot. He was \u2014 I think he was a communist before he war or at least a socialist, I don't know what \u2014 and he belonged to a group of people and he had some people there working against the Germans. And this Tolka brought me over to him. He introduced me to him. And we start working from this, this was our like headquarters. This Tolka had connections with the real partisans \u2014 not partisans special, but with the heads of the partisans. He had connections with the A.L.'\u2019. This was army in Armia Ludowa. There was a Gomulka\u201d\u2019 and there was a Moczar\u2019', and there was Zymierski\u201d\u201d and there were all the heads of Poland which were later on the Polish government, and he had some connections with these people. And little by little he almost gave his orders, instead of them, too. But we lost \u2014 we became appointed with Genek. In the nights we came to him, and he was taking care of us now. He was sending us out for special work. He told us which farmers have rifles or ammunition or something and he said, \"Go to this farmer and tell him he should give you a rifle. If he doesn't, you do whatever you feel like because he has it.\u201d\u201d And we did. And with the help \u2014"

And we were taking out some of them people like Sever Rubinstein and others, and they were going with us also. First of all, they knew the terrain. They know where to go. And we were strangers. We were not from this neighborhood, and this was very, very important. They knew every piece, every house, every farmer, every \u2014 they, they knew everything around there, and it was very, very helpful for us. Especially was one of them guys a young fellow was Franek Bleichman. He came from another town. We met also. He wasn't from this town from\u2014 what's name \u2014 Markuszow. He was from Kamionka, a small town. And he came out with a small group of his people, of Jewish people\u2014 young, youngsters. He was maybe 18, 19 years. He wasn't a army man too, but he was very shrewd and he was \u2014 he knew the neighborhood. His father, I think, was dealing with farmers or something and he was taking him with him, and he knew around the '9 Armia Ludowa 0 Wladyslaw Gomulka *1 Mieczyslaw \u201cMietek\u201d Moczar *2 Michal \u201cRola\u201d Zymierski neighborhood. And this Bleichman became very handy to us and he was always helping us, going when we needed in the night for a \u2014 certain things. Because this Tolka \u2014 no, Genek Kaminski, he gave us orders now already. He told us, \"Go in this and this place and there is \u2014 a train going through.\u201d And we took axes and very primitive things, shovels and all this, and take away a piece of rail, of rail. A train will come. It will fell off from this. And the first action was \u2014 the train was right in the beginning. And we came off \u2014 I remember I had a very strong man. Zelazny\u201d was his name, zelazny~* means iron. And we called him \u201cZelazny,\u201d because he was so strong, and he, he ripped out with those \u2014 almost with his hand, he ripped out a piece of the rail and but we still \u2014 he ripped it out but it was staying still. He didn't \u2014 he didn't take it away. And with axes, we were working there for hours until we heard a train coming. A train coming, and we stay away and the train stopped. It stopped there because when the train saw that something was missing or something later, the train stopped. But it disrupt already maybe a whole night and a whole day the communication because they, they were dragging who knows what \u2014 some ammunition to the front. It was on the way from Lublin to Warsaw. This, this was the spot. And we disrupted already this. Its \u2014 but we couldn't stay there too long, because we were afraid and we came back and we told this Tolka, reported to him that we did this and this. He was very happy, and this gave us some kind of a lift. \u201cOh, we can do things!\u201d Then he sent us out on the highways. We put up a metal string to the highways. When a car came, it had to stop. We stopped them and we were on the sides waiting for them. We had a few rifles already from the farmers what we took. But interesting was this. One of our man \u2014 his name was Finkel\u2019? \u2014 went back to the camp where I was working and there was another hospital too, and there were rifles and there were pistols and they were \u2014 what's the name \u2014 other things, what do you need? Coats, because when I ran out I couldn't take nothing with me. It was still warm. Nobody has a \u2014 nobody had a coat with him. It was cold. It start to be cold, so we were shivering cold. And we sent out this Finkel. He did \u2014 didn't look like a Jew completely. He was looking like a Pollack. And he went back to the camp and he organized there another 20 people. But this time they took a German and they told him \u2014 they were dealing with him, like I told you, the Jews were help \u2014 dealing with them Germans there. They told him, \"You see and look. Don't say nothing.\u201d And they put on the rifles and uniforms and what's the name \u2014 covers and bed spreads and all kinds of things, a full truck, and he was dealing with them before \u2014 robbing them to sell things, but he didn't know what is going on and we had \u2014 Finkel knew where we will be there in the woods. He made a an appointment with him, and he brought over the whole truck with maybe about 20 rifles. New ones, German ones. Completely new ones! And he brought it over to us on the spot. The German, that was one of the guy who was the leader from the Dworecki was his name. He said to the German, \"You go back and shut up. Don't say one word, you know us. You saw nothing, 3 \u201cZelazny\u201d Eisenberg 74 Tron (Polish) *\u00b0 Stefan Finkel because they will kill you, or we will kill you.

I remember in the army it was the other, other way. The officer was in the back and the soldiers were going in the front. I remember in the war, the old officers were in the back and the soldiers were in the front. Then here we changed it. I was always in the lead. I had to go in the front. Wherever you went, I had always with me let's say a Bleichman or another one, what knew the terrain and I was in the front, going and they were after me. That's what we was scared stiff. Every night when you go, you don't know what will happen. Who will shoot or who will do something to you, you understand?

You cannot tell the people that you are afraid. You had to go. You had to lead. And it was like a army. We got orders, you know, to burn down this and this village. And we did it. Next, we had this group of our people went out for food one night, a separate group, small, and on the way back some Polish people called over two of them what they knew them by name. Morel, and the other one I don't remember. Morel and the Pollacks, young boys from the same town where this Jew was, called him over, said, \u201cMorel, come over here.\u201d And he had a machine gun this guy and they called him over.

We knew the village where it happened. Then after meeting is an end, we decided to burn down the, the whole village. And we burned down the whole village. Came over at night from one corner to the other. But one thing we didn't, we didn't kill the people. We told them to run out before we went from one place to the other. We had straw and as we had other, I think gasoline a little, I think, we took, too, petroleum or something we had. We pour a little bit match and burned the whole village.

            "answer": "This was \u2014 it didn't feel good altogether because we had to live with them Pollacks. We didn't come to fight with the Pollacks, and we left them and I remember I wrote myself a piece of paper in Polish. I was \u2014 by the way, I was writing almost everything what I went through by the day. I had a paper, a book with me, paper and a pencil and I was writing down almost everything what happened. But I will tell you later what happened to it. And I wrote them a leaflet like that said, \"You see what you're doing. You kill our people. We have to kill you. We didn't come to fight with you. We want to fight the Germans, and I think you supposed to help us and not going against us and on top of this to kill our people.\u201d I left notes and left this. Then we had a case like this. We were in a farm house. And a Polish man there which lived there went to the Germans, and he told them. The Germans came and somehow we, we were always soldiers. That's what's good for us because we were watching. We had a watch outside, a watch inside. If we were sleeping, was still was a watch. One or two was watching. I was on the watch there outside and I see a lineup of Germans coming. It was on a hill. We were in a house and downstairs, down below the Germans are coming. I woke up everyone of us, put on \u2014 we had to \u2014 we start running out from the house because when they came to a house near that's it. Nobody could get out because they threw like we did. Straw or something and they start shooting with fire, ammunition, and they burned down the houses and they burned down the people there. We ran out and we run away a whole day, we had to fight with the Germans. We ran, shoot back, run and shoot back. No one of our people was killed there in this skirmish. In the night, the Germans disappeared. They left us alone. We went back to this village, and we went to the house where this happened where we left, left the house and we said, \"What's going on?\" The man wasn't there already and the son wasn't there and we start asking people. They said, \"The son went to the Germans and he told them that we are there.\u201d So, \"Good. We will stay there and watching.\u201d And all of a sudden I see there a young, a youngster walks and I called him over, say, \"Who are you?\" He said, \"Oh, I didn't want to. I\u2014 They \u2014 My father told me to go.\u201d It was the guy what we slept there, and he said his father told him to go to report to the Germans, you know, this. \"I will work with you. I will be with you and please don't kill me. Don't.\u201d We took him away. We really didn't want to kill him. Just want to beat him there, you know, a good beating, but I saw him. Of course, a man like this if he goes report the Germans, he's a spy already against us. This is nothing. Then we took him out in the outskirts and start beating him up. He was screaming there. Then one of our people saw that he screams too loud, took out the rifle and they killed him. I was sorry that they killed him, but still it was coming to him. When he killed him \u2014 he shot him it made a noise. The shot and the Germans were not far, and they start shooting at us and they started, but it was night and we just got away. The next day they buried this boy, the Pollacks or two days in the churchman. What is the name? The Pope. What is the name?"

They kept us. They told us to stay with them. Then we came to them back, and they told us what is going on. They told me the priests spoke like this, and the priest told them and knew he told them also. He said, \"Why do you have to go to call the Germans? The Germans are far away. They don't know what is going \u2014 coming in the, in the woods. If you told them, they know.\u201d And this made a big difference. Big, because people stop, stopped bothering us. They stopped, except they let us go. We came in. We did our work. We did never, never abuse them people because there were groups like robbers or something people came in they run away. They were on the German's hands or whatever, and they formed also, not partisans groups \u2014 bandits from this, and they came in usually and they took away whatever the farmer had. But we came in like gentlemen you know. We came in with a speech. I said \u2014 I told them, \u201cWe're fighting for freedom. We don't want nothing from you. We just want to eat something and we want to relax or to sleep a few hours.\u201d And this one farmer told the other, and they knew what's going on. Now \u2014"

            "question": "How, how much time had you spent in the woods with your group of men before you reached the point where you were confident about your leadership?",
            "answer": "It took time to be 100 percent confident in this. It was very, very hard. I will tell you straight. With Jewish people, it is very, very hard to be a leader. Every one of our Jewish people were a leader himself. They knew a lot you know. They are not dummies. Everyone of them, and to be a leader by Jews, you really have to have guts and you have to have patience and you have to have \u2014 I don't know what \u2014 to be a leader, but this is no jokes. This is I tell you at this \u2014 what's the Ben-Gurion?\u2019 said it was, \u201cI am a president of million presidents.\u201d And that was very, very hard for Jewish people this. But there was a necessity. I have the upper hand because I spoke fluent Polish. When I came to a farm or 6 Group (Yiddish) 7 David Ben-Gurion something I had \u2014 I had to speak because most of them spoke Yiddish and the language was difficult. Only Szengut was the guy what \u2014 but he looked so Jewish and so Yiddish he couldn't, he couldn't represent us you know. It was \u2014 we had to push him a little bit on the side. Now, we established our presence in the neighborhood, but we felt we couldn't stay too long in the neighborhood. They told us not to stay, and we didn't. We felt \u2014 because we exhausted \u2014 I came twice \u2014 three times to the same farmer. He didn't have what to eat himself to watch this, and we had to go farther. Then I decided to go with the group of 10 people to find out \u2014 because they were talking about other groups on the other side of the Bug. We were \u2014 there was \u2014 when you see the map, there was a, a \u2014 this river, Wieprz, is the name \u2014 Wieprz and the next was the Bug. The Bug was the border from Poland and Russia already later. But we were between the Wieprz and the Bug later. In the beginning, we were on the other side of the Wieprz. We had to cross. And we crossed over the Wieprz and we knew that between the Wieprz and Bug 1s a group \u2014 1s groups, partisans there that we heard about. You know they told us, the farmers. There was no telephones, but we heard that. We had connections all the time. This Genek, his connections was saving us always. We knew when the Germans going out from Lublin with a expedition of something, we knew about it. They told us. The farmers, one told the other and they told us. We had the connections. We had this. And only with connections we could live through. We were laughing already there when I was going sometimes in the night. I laughed and said what group 1s going again that meetings to get a connection then. I felt that is the way to be because when you are a group, you live by yourself, and you don't know \u2014 no telephones, nothing. You don't know what's going to come next, and they were spying. You have to have this. You have to know what your neighbor's doing. You have to know what's going on, and you have to know the other groups. You have to know what's in the, what's going on in the country or in Russia. We knew about politics. We knew everything was in the front. This in the front. This we knew everything what's going on. I was reading papers. I was seeing everything clearly. Otherwise, we couldn't live. It was impossible. Of course, a lot of groups were \u2014 a lot of Jews run away, and they didn't have the organization. They didn't have the connections and they disappeared. They disappeared. The Pollacks killed them themselves or somehow the Germans \u2014 they told the Germans. They disappeared. Disappeared group by group disappeared. And I went through this Wieprz. There was a whole story how we went through that. And we came over on the other side, and I was so tired. Unbelievably tired. And I was sorry that I brought them people on the other side because we were walking two days and two nights. We didn't know where we are going. Completely! We were \u2014 like I say, I didn't have the connection. I didn't have the people around me. The neighborhood there I knew already. I knew where I'm going. And here I didn't know nothing. And we walked over to a farm, and we woke up a woman there and she start screaming and crying, \"Please don't do this.\u201d I said, \"Don't worry. We will not do nothing to you. Just let us in.\u201d She said, \"No, I can't because I have a child 1s sick. Very sick. He had typhus or something and you will catch it too. Don't go in.\u201d Said, \"Okay, we will go in the barn.\u201d We went in the barn. We were dead. We were so tired of walking. I think it will start snowing or something later and there was a real night, I felt half, half dying. And I lay down in the, the barn and all our people. We always kept one men to watch and all of a sudden maybe it was day already. I wake up and I see nobody's watching. Nobody! I woke up, and I was a very sleeper \u2014 I, I could hear everything always when sleep. I don't know why. This was nature or something. I could hear everything. Whatever happened in sleep always, I could hear it. Then I walked over \u2014 I woked up, I went over to the door to the barn and I see, all of a sudden, I see Germans, Polish uniforms, the police, and farmers and the whole posse but still forming, still going. And I woke up my people very fast. And we walked out with the front and shooting at them. They were not still organized. They were still starting something then, and we start shooting at them. And walked around the barn, and we start running away. Because they were an army there. Who knows how many? I didn't know. And we start running, running and we \u2014 I see very bad. There's no trees, nothing. We are only a few houses there, and it is a field. They have a good field for us to shoot us when we running. They can shoot everybody. And little by little we start moving away, moving away and all of a sudden, I see one guy fall beside and then I see another one fall. They were not dead. Just one was shot in the foot, and one was somewhere else shot and he said, \"Please take my rifle. I am dead. They will kill me anyway.\u201d I said, \"I don't need your rifle. I have mine.\u201d I couldn't do nothing. Then all of a sudden I feel a shot. It was my finger here. I have still the finger here like this, shot here right here. I squeezed my hand. I see blood. Yes, I took out, I don't know, a handkerchief or something. I put it on. I didn't make a big deal of it. I was walking, walking. All of a sudden I feel a shot in my foot, in my leg. Yeah, right here. Through. And I cannot walk no more. I cannot walk. I was trying you know. Szengut right behind me, and he start pulling me. He said, \"You have to walk.\u201d In the meantime, the rest of the people \u2014 we were about 10 or 12 \u2014 start moving. You know, they cannot wait for me. They see this one 1s laying, another is laying, and he, he didn't leave me alone. He starts pulling me, and I start walking and walking. I see I still can walk. The bone wasn't touched. And this was luck. It was just the meat here that was shot here. And I could walk. It was bleeding a little bit, but I still walked. And we run over to a house there and we told the farmer, \"Fast put on a horse and wagon,\u2019 Szengut said, \u201cand we will put on \u2014 I will put you down on this on the wagon and we will start running away with this.\u201d Then all of a sudden I see the Germans right by the border there when I was, I was there. They came out. And one starts talking Polish to me. And he says in Polish, \"You're a Jew, bastard?\" or something, this. And he aimed with a rifle this, and he didn't, I don't know, he didn't hit me. I got up and Szengut grabbed me and left the horse with the wagon, and I start screaming with my people. I start screaming with my people, they rest, \"Stop and start shooting back. Start shooting back because otherwise nobody will live.\u201d And I remember like today this one of them guys, it was Andrejew. He was the first one. He turned around, took out the rifle, he was aiming at the Germans. The Germans stopped. They stopped. Right away they fell through the floor. And when he took out a few of our people. There was a Finkel there was a few four or five. They took out the rifles and they start shooting back. When they stopped the Germans, I had time to with Szengut to run away to come over and we went over to a woods somewhere there around not far, and the Germans stopped a little bit behind and they had three of our people and I think they, they killed there because I know \u2014 don't know what happened to them again. And between them was this Majdanek, this guy what run away from Majdanek. He was killed there right away in this skirmish. And I run away to the woods. In the meantime, Szengut and another one, Finkel, they both went back to look. Maybe they can help somebody to \u2014 they came to a farmhouse and they opened the door there, and when they opened the door Germans was sitting there. A whole bunch of them was sitting there, and they were singing or eating something. You know they, they had that trophy. They took away \u2014 I think they took away some money from these three guys too. They had maybe a few \u2014 I don't know what kind money. And Finkel closed the door and Szengut had hand grenade and they threw in there the hand grenade into this, and they don't know what happened there. Then they run away, and they found me. I was still waiting. And we took a farmer, stopped with a horse and wagon on this \u2014 put me on this and they sat down and I was with Szengut and another one and they had another \u2014 they stopped other farmers when they \u2014 on the way and we start moving. And on the way I asked the farmer, \"Maybe you will take me home because I am shot and I cannot \u2014 my finger start bothering me very much, more than the foot.\u201d I said, \"I cannot walk and I cannot, I cannot function.\u201d He said, \"You have to be helped.\u201d I said, \"Oh no, my wife is sick and there's a \u2014 I'm afraid, but I will bring you over. I have a farm and I have a man what works for me, and he will keep you. He will keep you there.\u201d I said, \"Alright, whatever he wanted to do.\u201d And he brought me over to another farmer and the farmer was very nice to me. They, they took a Band-Aid and they, they took some water. I don't know what kind of water. They washed it and they cleaned it very, very nice. They, they helped me out. It took almost a half a day, something, I was there sitting. All of a sudden, shooting again. I was with Szengut, and another Piasecki was another guy. We were there in the partition there. The rest of the group was in another house. Start shooting in the house. Like a thunder. Shoot directly in the house. And the farmer showed me the way out in the back and me and Piasecki. I got up and I said, \"Where is Henryk?\u201d I said, \"Where is Finkel?\u201d And I start looking back and I don't see him. And the farmer said, \"You cannot wait a second. Run. Run.\u201d And from the back of the farm it was already start to be a little darkish and I run away with Piasecki, this guy. We run away both of us. And with my wounded foot then I had to walk a whole night. I was walking in the woods. Walking, walking, walking. It was day almost. I went over. I had no, no choice already. I didn't know what to do myself. I walked over to a farmer. \u201cYou should help me something or give me a piece of bread or something.\u201d And I came over to the farm. The farmer boy standing there came out and said, \"God, what are you doing here?\" He said, \"The Germans were here last night here. And they killed one of your people,\" he said. And I figure out that that was Szengut. \u201cOne of you people was killed. And they took off even his boots they took off because he wore new boots. He said, \"They took off his boots and they took him away. And you are here! How does it happen?\" I walked a whole night in the woods and I came back to the same spot. You know in the night, you don't know where you're going and there's a woods. You don't know it that way. I came back to this house. Then in the day time, what I found out, the Germans are still there. They said, \"No. No. They went away. But they still come back or whatever.\u201d They said, \u201cThey knew that the partisans here, the group 1s here.\u201d I said, \"I have no choice. In the daytime with this Piasecki, we were both of us we start moving back from where I came. I came back and I came over to the Wieprz, to the river. There's a big river and you stay here a night. Cannot walk. Then all of a sudden came in a bunch, a bunch of Polish kids from school. They went there and they start screaming, \"Jew. Jew.\u201d I was so disgusted. At least I had something in my hand like glass. I will throw this as a bomb I said, \u201cif you don't go away, if you don't stop this screaming. \u201cThey shut up and then came in a man. I don't know, it looked like a school teacher. He was dressed up nice. He said, \"What happened? You are \u2014 you have a problem here?\" I said \u2014I said, \"Yes. I want to go through the Wieprz.\u201d I said, \"How can I go?\" He said, \"Don't worry. I will show you where.\u201d He brought me over to a small house there, and there 1t was a guy with his \u2014 he had this \u2014 a boat, a small boat, and he was bringing over people on other side. That was his \u2014 he said, \"You have money?\" Said, \"No, I don't have no money, but I have a lighter.\u201d I remember a very nice lighter. I had it from Kaganowicz, I forgot to tell the story. Kaganowicz was killed. And I took away a watch and some lighter and I think he had some money, and I took it away from him, and I had it with me. And this lighter I took out. \"Show me it works.\u201d I showed him it works. \"Okay.\u201d For this lighter, he took me over on the other side with Piasecki. We came over to the other side. The other side I knew already where farmers are and this I came over and I see a light, some a farmer. I see a light. I say I was afraid. You know this? I start looking near this and I came over and see the rest of my people are there. And they went \u2014 the Wieprz, then they came back to this farmer. They knew also the farmer from before because we knew when we left. We met and they said, \"Oh, you still alive. Somebody said that you are killed.\u201d They didn't know. Szengut was killed because they said somebody was wounded and he was killed. They knew already. Oh, they was so happy that I am alive, that \u2014 and I went back with this group. I remained maybe a day or something like a whole day without them too. They went for food or something and I was staying with them. It was also very, very bad. I was feeling very bad, but they left me and they went. But they came for me, and we went together. We went back to the place that we knew before. And they came over to a place where there was a bunker where I told them bunkers, and this Tolka had a bunker there before, before with his Markuszow people and Jegier and all those people. And I came over. There's nobody there. They disappeared. And all of a sudden came over a \u2014a father and daughter. Said, \"No, Tolka is no more here. He's somewhere else. They built another bunker because he was afraid to stay here. He built for 40 people, he built a bunker somewhere else. I said, \"Can I meet him.\u201d The guy said, \"Wait, maybe he has to come in here. Tolka has to come in here.\u201d I said, \"Alright.\u201d And it didn't take long. This Tolka came over with Nam\u2014 with somebody else. They said, \"Look. Look here, I am wounded,\u201d and they said, \"I haven't got where to take you. It's full there.\" \"It's 40 people,\" he said, \"We have no food there. It's impossible that we should take you. No.\u201d What can I do? Then I remind myself I met a guy, Drop was his name, like a farmer, a Pollack, what was nice to us. And I went back to him. I came back to him and he was, he was so fond of me. He start kissing me. He was so, so happy to see me, and he saw me in this condition and he kept me maybe a few weeks, a few weeks and all 10 of our people were there. Ten \u2014 two or three was killed \u2014 about nine people. We were there in his home by this Drop. He went to a drug store. He bought for me some, something to cover with and he helped me a lot. This finger gave me a lot of trouble. I got gangrene in this finger, and the whole hand was so we will have to cut this hand, but I had a very strong constitution and I felt good or whatever and it helped and it went away, but I have this till today. It's crooked. I can do nothing about it. I don't want to do nothing. The foot didn't gave me too much trouble. It was a time until it healed and I could walk and I was staying there. till February 14, 1943, I was by farm \u2014 Drop\u2019s farm."

After maybe two days, we walked around. All of a sudden in the night, we see a group is walking. Who knows? During the night we had our things. We called \"amkha,\" we called out. That was our \u2014 what do you call it?"

                " That was our way. But after a time, we had this experience and a woman came along. Still we didn't take her with us, but she was near us. She went \u2014 whenever we went, she was walking with us all night, and then when we stayed in a place so we had to do something. They were staying in another place. There was a woman with three men. Where they came? They came from Warsaw, she and another one. Her name was, her name was Hanka. Her friend was Halpern, the name Halpern. They both jumped from a train what went from Warsaw to Treblinka. After the Warsaw, they had the, the fight there. They run. They caught them, and they were bringing them to Treblinka. They jumped out through the train. And when they came from the train, the farmers told them that we are out. She just jumped out \u2014 this luck \u2014 she jumped on the spot but where we were. But after a few days, it was just some time when we knew we had a big job with a lot of people there. Came in some Polish \u2014 a group of Polish people were there, and they and us went for a big train, and we stopped the train and we burned down ammunition and oil and gas and \u2014 and we took away a few Germans there. And we were not used to shoot people there but there was some of them, officers from the Polish group said, \"What are you waiting, you Jews? You are afraid to kill?\" They killed right away the Germans there. But we little by little we got used to this blood, but still it wasn't my, my genes to kill people. I, I couldn't do it, but I want to talk to you now about helping them. When I met this Hanka, she was completely out. She was hungry and barefoot. It was unbelievable. One thing she has, she has a big hat. She covered her hair that they shouldn't see that she is a girl. She was afraid because girls was a problem. They didn't want that, so she put on a hat and covered her hair. She had short hair, covered. And she was in a blouse something, very, very bad shape. and I started talking to her. She told me the story about Warsaw ghetto. I didn't know what happened there. That's why I say through communication we find out what's going on, we found out what, what's going on, and happened she was her family or something from this leader Anielewicz\u201d*, and she knew what's going on there. She told us the whole story how the fight was going on. A lot of people run away, and they are looking for partisans to fight, to go somewhere. And I kept her around me. She was officially like my girl, you know, because I took care of her and I watched her, but she couldn't be with us to do some work *8 Mordechai Anielewicz or to live together in the quarters. They lived separately. And walking around there, I came to a farmer and there's like a small child three, four years, a girl, laying there dirty. She had \u2014 full of rats, she was \u2014 terrible situation she looked. And I took \u2014 I told \u2014 I said, \"Who is this child.\u201d He doesn't know, the farmer. He doesn't know. He found her on the street. I figured right away, it's a Jewish girl. And I cleaned her up and I brushed her and I stayed already and they special for her and I told the farmer, in no two ways, \"This girl has to live and this girl you will feed and you will watch her.\u201d He said, \"I am afraid the other farmers will tell on me.\u201d I said, \"Good.\u201d I went out. The whole village was not too big. It was a small one. And I knocked on the doors and the windows at night and I said, \"Listen, there will be in two weeks a young girl coming to you to live with you. You keep her. And this girl, if something will happen to her, you will all be burned down.\u201d \"You remember we burned down a place, I said to them. That will happen to you people.\u201d \"No. No. I will take care of it.\u201d Thank God, they took care of this kid. It did live through the war. She's today a teacher in Israel in the high school and I met her there when I was on 81, I met her, and she's healthy. She's married, and she has a nice family and I was very, very happy. She was happy to see me too. And she, she thanked me very well for this. "

Maybe two weeks, he was working with us. He took part in our actions, whatever that\u2019s supposed to be done. And he was very close with me. Somehow we got friendly, and we kept this friendship until he died now. Later, he died in Poland. And there was another one with the name \u201cBolek Alef,\u201d Bolkowiak\u2019\u2019. He was after the war a general in Poland. He stayed in Poland. This man was also from Warsaw. He was in action in Warsaw, in the ghetto and he ran away from the ghetto and he came to the woods.

And he spoke to them, he made a political \u2014 told them, \"Listen. Those partisans, they are fighters. They are Jews. They are doing their job and we are working together and help them and work with them.\u201d It was very, very important for us because, you know, we were not alone. That's what I said all the time. We were with an organization. We worked with them. And this helped. All the time came in, there was a Polish group there what they were fighting as partisans but they were home more. When they are needed, they came out. When we did something \u2014 there's a train or something, they came with us and they helped us. Was a Franek \u2014 was a guy, Przybyszowka was a village. It was a very important group because they helped us a lot. And they had some connections with Russia, too, and Moczar had a connection with Russia.

They were not friendly to us. But we met once in while because we caught \u2014 a guy came from London. He was thrown down by a parachute, to help the partisans, whatever. And he was from the A.K. He told us right away. We caught him. He fell into our hands. And he start talking to us, and he showed us how to make hand grenades, a big one he was making. And he was with us a few days. Then we brought him over. He said he wants to go. He has contacts and he wants to go immediately. And you shouldn't bring him. We were very careful, but we brought him over there, and they made a party for us. They gave us food because they knew the guy. Nothing happened to us and we were very careful. We were standing outside. The whole group. We were two or three people only working. Jegier and me worked, and the rest were standing outside to watch. But we didn't feel comfortable with them let's say put it this way. If they \u2014 they caught a Jew separately on his own, they will kill. You know, as a group, they couldn't start with us. They, they \u2014 they knew that what could happen to them. They didn't want to start with us. But individuals, if they caught somebody, they \u2014 they caught the Morel, I told.

Jegier with a group, and my group was divided Jegier went away with \u2014 some parachutes came down. Some Russian groups came down and he had to bring him over to some \u2014 kind of place. He was to stay with them. And I went over to the other side of the Wieprz, between Wieprz and Bug. There were other groups there, and we have to unite because we cannot stay there. First of all, the terrain \u2014 the place where we were, were very antisemitic. They, they were known. We lived there from day to day because we had pistols, we had rifles. When we came to a farmer, he couldn't say nothing because he was afraid of us. But we didn't have the work with them you know. You couldn't work with them. The other side were, were the White Russians. They \u2014 I don't know \u2014 somehow they were better to us and they were nicer people. And then they helped us and they told us to go there on the other side. And on the way, there a very big fight by the Wieprz, by crossing the Wieprz. The Germans were there and waiting for us >? Jan Leon Hipolit Kozietulski and we almost didn't make it to Wieprz. They, they, they made a ring around us, and they were shooting and somehow someway we run through this one guy helped us with a boat, from our people other side and no one was killed. Nobody. And we came out on the other side, and the other side, they were shoot \u2014 the Pollacks, the A.K. were shooting on us. They didn't know who this was, was all mixed up there. And the Germans pinned down a group of very, very important men from Russia that came to Janowski>\u2019, he was a writer from a main paper in Poland after the war. And they pinned them down. They couldn't \u2014 they couldn't move. They couldn't walk through the Wieprz, they couldn't. They stayed on the other side. We went through again. Then again an order came back say, \"Go and rescue him.\u201d We went back. About four, or five people, was Bleichman, Finkel, and other Zelazny. We went back and we took a boat, some wires, something \u2014 I don't remember exactly what it was. We brought over the whole group \u2014 20 people. We brought those whole \u2014 oh, he said this Janowski came from Russia. He was a big shot from there already. And he said, \"You will get medals for this. You, you did a job like.\u201d He was wounded, too. We was carrying on our hands. I remember, Zelazny, he was very strong man, we carried with his hands. We carried him over. And we came to another place, another group, and after a few days, we met Chiel Grynszpan**. Chiel Grynszpan had a group already from 40, 50 people there. And then people were from the neighborhood people. He himself was a soldier. He was a \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 cavalry men, on horses. He always liked to be on a horse and he felt good with this. And he, he was a very plain man, a good man, and a good soldier. He had a discipline with them people. We needed it because nobody knew how to keep a rifle, nothing. He was the only one there that knew something. There was another one later on. But he \u2014 he managed. He was there immediately. When we came down, he was happy. They really loved us, because we became soldiers. We became some kind of a army and together right away, we started on trains. This is how highways, trains, communications lines cut and we together. Big train, but river and it was a bridge. Thunder. We broke down the whole bridge, you know. It was on the border, the train. And the same time I was with another group, maybe a hundred people. There was children and women and all kinds of this there, and I found there. And I had to carry them too. And on the way, like I say, we were the first one always to go. I walked straight on a German with a rifle. And I walked them into the rifle. Imagine how that \u2014 how I felt. I stand still like a, like a dummy. I didn't know what to do. And all my people \u2014 was maybe a 100 of them \u2014 all disappeared. In a second, I didn't see nobody. Myself I stand on the highway."

We had the children with us, and we start dragging them around and the Pollacks start screaming at us, \"The Germans will look for them,\" and you have to do something. I didn't want to kill them.

He, he was a soldier and he gave me the rifle and didn't nothing. He could shoot me like nothing. He was in \u2014 he saw me and he gave it, and I didn't know. And we kept him maybe a week or two until we met with Chiel back again and there's another group come over there, Russians and all this, and we made a meeting with three or four officers.

When they were shooting the rifle the bullet goes to, to them like they go to us. And they were all going from us open, they were not afraid Jews, they're not afraid. They go. And they were shooting back. I'm sure they were killed, but directly to shoot. You had only three guys when you shot \u2014 went into a train, but we didn't shot. The Pollacks shot them. But it's different. It was our group that shot them, and then three were shot directly from us. We had later on more, but this was till then. And we \u2014 I told you straight, us Jews we had once affect, we had a guy what was a Pollack and he was with us, and he denounced us. He was with us, fighting with us, going with us and he had a chance. He just disappeared for a few minutes and he told somebody. He had contact where we were going and what we are doing.

And they came the Polish guys what I told you, they helped us out they were kids. They were kids, that one Franek, he said, \u201cHere, you shoot the man like this.\u201d And he took out a pistol and he shot him. We didn't have the guts to shoot somehow. I was a military man, but still directly to shoot in a fight it's different. Directly to shoot wasn\u2019t to easy. Okay now, we went in a, in a village. The name was Bojki, and in Bojki we were staying two and a half months, in one spot. And there we formed a real army. We formed groups. You know we made groups, small ones. Every one group had a leader and we made a military establishment. And people were going out, out just to big farms we went out. We collected cows and food, swine, whatever it is, whatever we needed for food, and we brought it over, and we had a base. We was staying there. The Germans knew that we are there. The Pollacks knew we are there. Nobody bothered us. We are staying there. We went out every night, for trains or whatever you had to do. We walked away from there. And they were not doing nothing.

Most of them were Jews, officers, trained in Russia or somewhere, and they came to us. And women came over and now the story about ladies, women. Hanka was the only one women what I knew that she is around like this. And I didn't know. When I came to Chiel, I find there a whole group of people, old, young, children. There were a few hundred hidden in a wood, in a very, very strange pieces of land there. It was water and you couldn't get there. No German, nobody could get there. And they pushed them there on this land, and they put them there. And then they were bring to them food, something once in awhile. Not too much. They were hungry. And when I came, she said to me, \"This is people what I know. They are almost from my villages there. I know most of them people.\" Pollacks came over to me and they said they will kill all of them if they wouldn't stop grabbing the chickens and the food in the night. And they didn't have what to eat, and they ran out in the night. They were going to the farmer. And the farmers were ours, because we were standing \u2014 they knew us.

You know, the horses went through everything. And I came to the place. I came to the place. I couldn't believe it. When I remind myself, I want to cry now. It was my job. People naked, half naked. Ladies! Men! Children! Everybody, they had some kind of covers they had. They made. They built. Not on the ground. On top. And they were cooking, making food, something for the family.. When I saw this group, I couldn't \u2014I couldn't believe. I see people. It's like from the old times. You see in the \u2014 from the history books. You see people like this. And in between I looked down and I see a woman. She looks like my mother. Imagine! And here I came in this in to kill them. I have to kill somebody or I have to do something. I see my mother there. I went over to her and I talked to her and I said, \"Where you come from?\" And I talked to others. And then I put them together, and lined up and I said, \"Listen people. You want to live. You have to behave. You have to do something else. You cannot just go to the farmers, rob them. Wait for us. Organize something. There should be some organization because otherwise, they will \u2014 you will perish and we will perish altogether. And they told me that a few youngsters there what were really no good. They were robbing. I said, \"You three will come with me.\u201d They, they had some mothers there. They had two sisters, and they thought I'm going to kill them. And that was the, the, the order to kill them. And I said, \"Oh no, I will not kill nobody here. They depend on me absolutely. I'm not killing nobody.\u201d After going through a thing like this, and I took them away and I brought them over to the group, them three and they were very, very good soldiers there. One is still today my best friend. Whenever he sees me, he doesn't know what to do with me. All three left with me and they are \u2014 they were with me. But the group \u2014 the women, it was at a time the Pollacks still didn't give up. They have to be feeded. I said, \u201cThis is no good. We have to take them away.\u201d And we brought the whole group, little by little, not in one shot, into the group, into the village there nobody should know. Not even the headquarters didn't know, nobody didn't know. And we brought over \u2014 and every group \u2014 we had maybe a 100, 120 people there, and every group we took in one or two women and they were cooking for us because we were standing in one place. They were cooking, they were washing. We had shirts to wash or something. Then the women start working for us and they were doing group \u2014 some of them were very brave, and they said, \"What do you mean washing this? We want to have a rifle too.\u201d And have a Dora and another one there, Roska, and this, and they, they picked up rifles.

When Rola Zymierski came First of May, and told us that near \u2014 the front is near. He said, \"You have to disappear from this terrain, from this land. We have to go deeper and fight other Germans, deeper, deeper to the Weichsel to go deeper into the country, to the west. The Bug was east, and we have to go to the west. Then I remember I went, \u201cChiel,\u201d I said, \u201cListen, what shall we do?\" I was afraid of these Pollacks there on the other side. They were not too friendly to us, and here we had no freedom. We were staying in one place for so many months. We knew the people already, and they knew us. We lived. Then I said, \"Maybe we shouldn't go.\u201d And Chiel said the same thing, \"I know the people here, they knew me.\u201d They know Chiel. Big shot he came with his horse. They all \u2014 they, they respect. And he liked to drink, he liked women. He was a good leader, you know, a real one, a partisan. I was more the intelligent type you know. It was \u2014 when they needed something, they came to me, and I have \u2014 I took care of everything. But he was a soldier. And I said, \"We will not go.\u201d And I went over to Rola Zymierski and I said, \"You're going away, and this piece of land stays empty. Nobody from, from the partisans, nobody will be here. Let us be the guard. When the Russian front come near, we will go come \u2014 we will go back. But in the meantime, we will need 100 people here just to cover your retreat when you go back to them.\u201d He said, \"It's a idea. Stay.\u201d\u201d And we remained here, and I remained there with 100 people we remained on the site of the Wieprz \u2014 between the Wieprz and the Bug. And they went \u2014 the Wieprz, they went through, and they went to the terrain where I was before. Garbow, Lubartow, and other towns there. It didn't take too long. The Pollacks, the A.K., they came over to me, and he said, \"You want to live. You want to live the group \u2014 a group nice there. You have to belong to us. You have to get with us together and work together. You cannot be on your own because everybody left \u2014 not you, not the Russians, not the Pollacks, everybody already. Only here you are, you are group. You have to belong to us.\u201d I said, \"Oh, oh, this is, this is death.\u201d Meantime \u2014 the same time Baranovskiy *\u00b0 a general from Russia came down with airplanes, and the whole group of real army. I'm telling you soldiers one by one. They were really equipped. Everything too. And this Baranovskiy we found out through channels he's a Jew too, but he didn't give it up. He didn't. He never said that he's a Jew. And after a few days, we said, \u201cWhat do we have to do the A.K.?\u201d We said, \u201cWe will go over to Baranovskiy and want to meet him. They say he came over on the terrain there.\u201d And we went to help him and how he can help us. We came over to him. He had a wife with him, and he had a pirate, a pirate, that\u2019s a pir\u2014 that is a big bird, and he had caviar and he took us in like a \u2014 and it was something else. We were dressed military dressed, very nice \u2014 I think was good looking then \u2014 and he start talking to me right way in Russia because I understood Russia, the Polish Russia. And he said, \"What you, what you have to go by yourselves?\u201d He proposed us until I\u2014 we didn't even say nothing. He said, \"Come to me. Come to us. We will form one group. We have a few hundred people and you be there. I see you are soldiers. You are in that group. You come to us.\u201d And that's what we were waiting for. And we came, the whole group came to Baranovskiy. And when we came to Baranovskiy, he took us in, he divided with us right away. \u201cNo more Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot be Jews. By a group you have to be separate. Every group, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, whatever it is. You cannot be Jews by themselves. This is our policy. And this is it. You can do that otherwise. Whatever you want, you have to be divided.\u201d In the meantime, he made me \u2014 and he made a group in Russian \u2014 Russian kept separate, and he made from Polish people, A.L. he called them. The are Armia Ludowa. He made a group, and I was \u2014 he made me the leader. From Pollacks and from Jews and I was the leader of them. Not Chiel, Chiel stayed. Then one night he calls me, Chiel, he calls out, \"Listen you two. I want you to leave. I am sending you to Moscow, you two.\u201d I said, \"What do you mean? we'll leave the people,\" I said. \"Never mind, you two. I have very important papers. I have to send them over.\u201d \u201cHow you will do?\u201d \u201cI make a conference from all officers, Russian, Polish, anyone, and when I will say I have a mission and I need volunteers.

I have to send you two.\u201d And we came to the meeting and sat and meantime at the meeting, there came a guy from Warsaw ghetto. He run away. He was a politician. He was \u2014 I think he was a communist, something like that. He was the political figure there. He said, \"I'm going, too, at this meeting.\u201d He goes to the meeting too. And he knows about us that have to get up and we're together and we sit three of us together and all of sudden, this General Baranovskiy says, \"I have to send out some people with papers and all this.
