            "question": "And could you tell us a little bit about your life before the war.",
            "answer": "My life before the war was very, very nice. I remember living in a very nice house, actually an apartment on the Pest side of Budapest. You probably know the city is divided by the Danube and the part that I lived in we had mostly apartment houses as opposed to the other part which was private homes. And I was...uh...besides my parents, obviously, I had...uh...nannies and governesses and we led a very, very comfortable life with lots of vacations and...uh.. parties and I went to elementary school. And... uh...in school we had...uh...we had religious education in the public school system...uh...besides the languages, arts, geography, history and math, everybody went to their own religious classes during that particular period so as Jewish children went to a class where a Rabbi taught Jewish history, Hebrew, whatever. Catholics went to Catholic class and Protestants went to Protestant class and everybody mingled and got along very well and I was never aware of Jewish or not Jewish or anything else pertaining to religion until much later. And until 1944, which was when I was 10 years old, I really don't recall anything particularly disrupting my life. In retrospect, now I understand that many things were going on since 1939. I was aware that my father was in labor camp, but I thought that was just being a soldier and he always came back. Uh...He went several times and came back and I...my mother did go help my father...run my father's business. My father was in paper...wholesale paper manufacturing business. Uh...But otherwise I, personally, was not aware of having to be afraid or being concerned until 1944. And that was a particularly special day in my life because my birthday is March 18th and I was having my 10th birthday party in my...my home with all my friends. They were really my parents' friends, children who I was brought up with, as well as some of the mothers and a lot of the nannies or governesses. And it was an early evening party of hot dogs, and...uh...we lived on a fairly main street. We heard marching of soldiers and we looked out the window and the German army at that point, to my recall, was occupying Budapest. Hungary was the last of the Eastern European countries to be occupied. Poland and the other countries had already had German troops in them. And everybody started running around and there went my party. Everybody went home. And the reason being that they were all afraid and that the Germans at that time were occupying Budapest and...uh...that's when our whole world really fell apart. Uh... There were a lot of negotiations. I didn't really know what was going on. Everybody tried to keep the children from worrying and...uh...we lived in...uh...a designated house that was called the Jewish house...uh... which happened to have been the building which we were in. What that meant is that several houses, apartment houses, were designated Jewish houses where the Christians had the option to stay or go. In a Jewish house, the Jews stayed and the ones that were not the Jewish houses, the Jews had to leave. Also we had a fairly large apartment, and we were only allowed to live in one room. But because my father was fairly active in the Jewish community, we were able to pick the families to move into all the other rooms. So we had friends and family move in. Uh...My parents' bedroom because our...our room. We had friends in the living room and somebody else in the dining room and somebody else in my...in my old room. Uh...That's when I first was aware of the fact that things were not quite the same. Also, one of the laws that came to pass at the time was that Jews could not have help, servants or whatever you want to call them. And...uh...so all our so-called staff, which consisted of my governess and a cook and a maid, had to leave. Uh..."

            "answer": "Uh...Well, 1t was difficult because we had bathrooms and all that but it was a...1t was really really interesting from a child's point of view. It was a time of sharing and pulling together. I was an only child, so I thought it was just terrific to have all these children running around and I was always brought up very properly, to behave myself and speak when I was spoken to, and here they were all these people running around. And one of my father's very good friends who was a lawyer and had a great deal of...a tremendous sense of humor wrote poetry for the bathroom, to the effect that the men were to put the toilet seats down after use and all sorts of funny things. We just thought that this was great fun and we played jokes...uh...on the grownups and...uh...but things did progressively get worse because... And one of my first personal experiences as a child was when a little girl who lived in the building, who stayed in the building...all the Gentiles chose to stay in the building in their own apartments, but they kept the whole apartment. And one little girl said...I asked if I could play with her in that afternoon as we usually had, and she said no, she couldn't play with me. I said, \"Well, how about tomorrow?\" And she said, \"No, she can't play with me tomorrow either.\u201d And I said, \"Well, why not?\" And she said, \"Because you're Jewish.\u201d And I said, \"Well, I don't really understand what that means or what does that have to do with anything anyhow.\u201d And she said well, she didn't know either, but her parents said that she couldn't play with a Jewish child.\u201d So..."

            "answer": "Well, by this time we weren't going to school. We were only ...Jews were only allowed to shop and market in the stores late in the afternoon. They were only allowed on the street ...uh...for an hour or so, when the produce and most of the stuff was gone and what was there was not terrific. Uh...my father would go to the Jewish Community Center to see what he could do. Uh...My father was a prominent person in the Jewish community so that the wealthy Jews still had some influence and were able to do such things, such as acquiring the...the Star for our building to remain in our house and...uh...to get much more information than we would have gotten otherwise."

Had to be exactly put on each item of clothes as a certain measurement that had to be...and it had to be put on the left upper shoulder of each garment. In other words, that when you went out on the street, you should always be identified and if somebody wanted to spit on you, kick you, shoot you, take you away, that's what you were to do."

            "answer": "Yes, I did go out on the streets. We did go out. I have this...my...my little boyfriend who is 11, and he and I would go out and do some stuff in the neighborhood. We would also buy newspapers and sell them within the building. And...uh...we also, I remember...nobody in my family smoked, but people did. Europeans smoked a lot. And we would pick up cigarette butts from everybody...wherever we could find them, take out the leftover tobacco and roll them in tissue paper. I have no idea where we got the tissue paper. And sell them to the smokers, because there was a shortage of all things. And so having this and, of course, the fact that we were children everybody bought it for us and we decided that we would support our parents because we did realize that nobody was working. And I'm not sure we supported them, but it was again great fun."

            "question": "Did you have any frightening instances on the street?",
            "answer": "No, I never had any frightening instances on the street. No. Uh...I did have...uh...a lot of fun things in the... in the apartment as a I said because we were friends and we had all the people. We played tricks on people and stuff like that. But, 1t was getting to be frightening because you ...you had sense of doom. You had a sense that there was... there was a lot of whispering going on, and sometimes not knowing what is going on is almost as bad as sharing and being told that okay, these are the things that can happen. Uh...There were a lot of trucks...uh...obviously, going on the street with lots of people in it, and everybody was making up stories about where they were going. Labor camp, to the country, all sorts of things, but it was...1t was getting obvious even at my age that people were being picked up, but I didn't know why. And this lasted from about the middle of March until...uh...the fall in October. And in October, the Jewish houses did no longer protect the people that were there. Uh...my parents were able to...uh...get the Wallenberg protection papers. Raoul Wallenberg, under the Swedish king, was able to protect and save a lot of people. They were designated Swedish houses, protectorates, where they claimed that Jews could be saved and we did go to such a house...uh...for one night and they had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. I don't know how many. But my parents decided that there were just two many Jews under one roof and if the...1f the Germans really wanted to get rid of a whole bunch at a time, we would be better off going somewhere else where...where it would not be so obvious that we're together. I think that night that we left our home in October was the first time that I was really scared and I think that was the experience that, as a young adult, stayed with me for a long time. I was very attached to a pillow that I carried. We had no suitcases to take with us because we had to travel light. Uh...we were dressed, all of us, in several layers of clothes so as to have some warmth and have some change and I did take my pillow. And...uh...I also had long...long hair. I had long braids which were cut in case the sanitary facilities were non existent and I shouldn't get lice. And I remember asking my parents...uh...where're we going to sleep that night. And my parents said, \"We didn't know.\u201d We were just hoping that somebody would take us in. I said, \"But we have to have a bed. We have to sleep.\u201d And that was really very upsetting and as I said that took me a long time. I always like to know where I'm going to sleep. I don't like to go. I have to know where my bed is going to be. And we went to somebody's house who took us in for one night, that night, and again everybody whispered and it was really scary. People were being picked up on the street. And from then on, we went to several places."

I mean I was asking questions, but I guess my parents were...this was not the time for the truth. It was just time for me to be quiet and do what I was told. I remember very distinctly once taking issue with something that I had seen, and my mother gave me a very stern lecture and she said that if she says it's black and if I know that it is white, but if she said that it is black, it is black and I am never, ever to question because that's how people get killed. And this was not a time that people came up and said, \"Are you Jewish,\" and my parents obviously were going to say no, and if I would have answered, \"Oh, yes, we are Jewish. Why are you telling a lie?\" That could get you into a lot of trouble. So I was really at a very young age told...was told to just do what I'm told and not to ask questions."

            "question": "Were you still wearing your star?",
            "answer": "No. No. At this time we were so serious. This was not admitting to being a Jew. This was hiding...uh...and my mother did not look Jewish. My father did. And, of course, it's very easy to determine if a man is Jewish or isn't, especially in those days so that my mother always did all the talking. And...uh...she was very competent and very strong willed and...uh...was able to handle these situations. We did go to somebody's house where we stayed for two weeks. Uh...A man worked for my father and my father gave him the position as superintendent of one of the houses, apartment houses, that my father owned, and he let us stay in the basement...uh...for a couple of days, and brought us food whenever he could. And a very nice family who I think was aware that something that was going on, told the superintendent...uh...that they were going to be away for quite awhile and sort of insinuating that without their knowledge but it's okay, 1f we stayed in their apartment. Uh...I don't think we ever met them, but that's what the superintendent told us, that it's okay for us to be taken to this spot. He would bring us a tray. There was a radio. Uh...We listened to...uh...Radio Free Europe, and this lady happened to have had the best collection of child...of children's books, and I remember reading Little Lord Fauntleroy and a lot of the children's classics. I remember that very well. I was a avid reader, and that was the only place during the war that there were books that I read. I used to remember taking a bath. I was too hot and I almost passed out. And one of the things that happened that I recall very clearly...and it's interesting because my mother just finished her interview and she didn't mention it...my father was having a kidney stone attack or had...we thought he had a kidney stone, and he was having an attack. And he had no choice. He had to go to a doctor. So he went and he left...uh...quite late in the afternoon so as...so as to be dark and my mother and I sat there wondering if he would ever return, if he was going to be caught or what. But he had to go because he had I guess ...I'm not sure but he must have had a kidney problem before because the choice was not to stay. It was not going to go away. Anyhow, he returned. I don't know what happened to the kidney or the stone, but he came back. And from then on, we went to a place in the country, a very beautiful house. And by this time, there was a lot of bombing going on because the Russians and Americans were bombing. The Germans were starting to lose the war, so their interest in the Jews were getting less except if they happened to see any, they shot them. But I mean, it was not as active involvement in killing the Jews as to save their necks because they were losing the war. I remember somebody being shot. I think it was a Russian or a German. I'm not sure. But I know there was a dead body, and somebody went out and stole their shoes or whatever they could off the body. But I don't really remember the details. I just know that this was a body and people went and stole things off the body because peple were now at this point didn't have shoes, didn't have clothes. The food situation was terrible. And I was an obnoxious, terrible eater. I still am. I don't eat if I don't like it. And most of the children just ate whatever there was to eat, including horsemeat off dead horses, but I was not having anything to do with that. So I had a hard time being fed because sometimes when something was found that was edible I save it up for a week and chop up little pieces of it and I would just eat it because I wouldn't eat if I didn't like it."

I remember my mother mending things when they were torn. Wearing the same dress, you know, over and over again. Sometimes rinsing things out in little pails if there was enough time for it to dry to wear again. And then as the bombing got worse and worse, we moved. We didn't move, we walked to the countryside. I wouldn't call it a suburb. It was really countryside, village, peasants, a lot of poor people lived there."

And out of this egg, she whipped up a I guess what you could call yellow cake thing and there was the one egg and I guess she had the other ingredients. So I ate that for a very, very long time. And then this...this was in the country and there was a lot of bombing going on. It was sort of getting towards the end of the war. We all slept on the floor. Usually I slept between my parents.

And a lot of people who should have at the time believed that it existed refused to believe it because it was so mind-boggling and I don't reallythink I had any particular feelings or total awareness of just exactly...I knew we were in hiding and I knew we were running away from being taken away. And then as we started coming back, I remember my father saying that if there was anybody in our home he would just kill them. Which is most unlikely because he was a very, very gentle man. But you do get angry. But I think it was when it was all over for us, I think it was a relief that it was over and some of the anger kind of went away. And I am an only child and since my parents and I survived together, that was already a good beginning. A tremendous amount of our relatives were gassed in Auschwitz. Most of these relatives being my grandmother's sisters, brothers, and their children. Then after the war were the horrors of identifying people. Yes."

They cleaned up...the cleanup process was really the bodies and they were just all over the place. At our temple...in the backyard of the temple -- the court I guess is what you would call it -- became a graveyard for those who could not be identified or they were such...they were so totally disfigured that they were not recognized. My father went to identify people and, you know, one of the ways to identify these bodies that were practically not recognizable through their teeth, through dental something. I'm not sure what, but it was like their teeth or through birthmarks, stuff like that. So that was a horrible experience."

For a long time as an adult 1n this country or as a young adult, I never wanted to go anywhere without knowing where I'm going to sleep and I do not like sirens because we always ran to the shelter and I always knew that when the bombing started that there was the potential of being killed."

And my grandparents had come to this country in 1939 to visit the World's Fair and my grandfather I guess he was smarter than most of us, had planned to stay. He just didn't tell my grandmother because she wouldn't have left. And so we came out here to this country in 1947. It took a while to get papers and visas and all that kind of stuff."

So it was a trade. And my father was in on some of the negotiations. They were not intimate friends, but as my mother told the story, that he was a perfect gentleman and elegantly dressed, as all Germans were, as opposed to the Russians, who were boors and did not, you know, their uniforms were not as the Germans' were. The Germans always were saluted and were, you know, in their own horrible way were always perfectly behaved. Such as Eichmann who obviously was not a perfect gentleman otherwise. And the Russians were...were just the opposite. But when the war was over, there were a lot of American soldiers were and my parents became quite friendly with some of them. And the, as I said, the wheels started working...to my father, was not really thrilled about coming to this country in the beginning. I mean, he thought that everything was just...that was his home, and..."

By this time, my father had acquired some of his properties back. We weren't penniless. We weren't escaping. We packed our belongings and we were taking a trip. We had left options that if my parents didn't like it here to come back, to go back to Budapest. Things were packed, ready to be shipped if we had said to ship it or not.And as I said, wecame out first class and my grandfather was here. My uncle was here. We had relatives here. It was a difficult adjustment for my parents. New language. New country. Different lifestyle. My father was a very prominent person in Budapest, and here he wasn't. So it took a long time for him to adjust...and probably a little bit faster for my mother. But I went to school. I literally got off the boat, went to camp, and then went to school. And except for the fact that I spoke with an accent and I was probably a little embarrassed that my parents did, I just became an American teenager."

            "answer": "In New York. I lived in New York all my young and old adult life. I went to schools in Manhattan and I have one daughter and three grandsons. And that's the story. I think that I got involved with the Holocaust Musuem...actually, my daughter had pointed out to me about a year ago a New York magazine had written an article about the Hidden Children Conference that had taken place last year in the summer, and she thought it would be something...something I should look into. And I did. And I did attend the Conference and I realize that with my generation...it's kind of the end of the road for the people that have been there, that participated. That after me it's just history, which is very different from having been there. And I think that's for us who...whatever way participated in the war, it's very important to record the history, to tell our children and their children. And when I attended the Conference, I went with mixed feelings, thinking, you know, the war is over. This was fifty or forty years ago. What am I doing here? And I found the Conference very, very moving. I found a lot fo Hungarians. Some from similar and some from different backgrounds. A lot of the nationalities formed support groups within themselves. The Hungarian women of my generation formed a group. The Hungarian women that have been meeting monthly and during the Conference besides meetings and people still searching for each other and people finding each other...there was also a large library of books on the Holcaust. And I bought one book: the name of it was Remember Never to Forget. And it was a book written for children in a very simplistic way with pictures, black and white barbed wire, but nothing particularly scary, certainly if you don't know what it's all about. And I bought the book thinking that one of the days when my grandchildren are old enough, I will read it to them. And I forgot all about it. And this summer I took my oldest grandson who js six and a half to the train to pick up somebody and as we were standing at the train station, he raised his right hand in sort of a Hitler salute and said, \"Heil Hitler.\" And I was very upset and I tried very hard not to scare him. He didn't think he was doing anything bad. And we sat down on a bench and I said, \"Adam, I don't ever want you to say that again, and I want to tell you a little bit about who Hitler was, what he did, and how it affected me.\" And he really was fascinated. He's a very bright little boy and he's very curious. And I said, \"When we go home, I have a book that I'm going to read to you,\" which I subsequently did. But the reason he did this \"Heil Hitler\", because we had been watching \"The Sound of Music\", and he loved the music and that was one of the salutes. So that's where it all came from. But the concept was still there and I had to get rid of his other brothers, because they really were too young, and he and I went into a room and read this story. And since then he has very often asked me to tell him stories."
