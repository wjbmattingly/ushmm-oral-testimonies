My father was a very prominent lawyer, made a lot of money, we lived very nicely and comfortable. He was also, as a lawyer, not prepared to move to a different country with different law. A doctor can move anywhere, learn the language and check the people. My father, by the time we got here was 60, and he -- he did -- his English was pretty grim.

She was one of the first women who got a doctor\u2019s degree, at a time when most of them didn\u2019t even have high school, she started at the University of Breslau, and had a PhD. She never used it, too bad, but she -- she was a very intelligent woman, and that helped. My father studied law in Germany, and he was just a young lawyer when he was drafted into the army. After he came back, he met my mother and they were married very shortly after. You know, after the war, there\u2019s always -- the men come home, the same thing after this war, they want to settle down. We were two children, I am Ruth, my sister who was younger, was Margaret. And we lived in a plain place in the beginning, because you couldn\u2019t get anything. Then we had a very beautiful home. And we were beginning to look to come to the United State. We did get a visa from my father\u2019s cousin, whose parents had come to the States already, we didn\u2019t know her. But, as I said, the Polish quota was oversubscribed by that time in \u201937 or so when we started looking. You just couldn\u2019t get on it any more. So we looked around to see if there was any place that we could wait, like for instance, Cuba. "

            "question": "I-I want to spend a little more time on your childhood. Do you know anything about your grandparents from either side? Do you remember them, do you know their names?",
            "answer": "My father\u2019s parents had died long before me. I somewhere have a little family tree, but it\u2019s not very helpful. They must have been born early in the previous century. My mother\u2019s parents I knew, but they too -- my grandfather died very early of a gallbladder operation. My grandmother, we had to leave her behind, because she was old and a little weak. We couldn\u2019t have left with her. So wi -- my parents took her into a Jewish home in Breslau, paid forever, and one thing I really like to mention that, we had a lovely cook with us forever, she was a very devoted Catholic lady. And when my grandmother went to that home, she rearranged for her to have a job there, so my grandmother had somebody who was familiar. What we were told 1s that she died in the home. I hope it\u2019s true. I come back to that life -- cook of ours later. As a -- my childhood was all right. When things became difficult, I left the school where I was, because these were the daughters of the big shots of Nazis, and my parents sent me to a school run by the church. The teachers were not nuns or anything, but they were [indecipherable] with everybody was from the church. There were quite a few Jewish kids there. In the beginning when we came, the teacher would come in [indecipherable] crystals, I don\u2019t know if you understand that. When Hitler came, heil Hitler. So that wasn\u2019t so great after awhile, but they were very dedicated to helping the Jewish kids. But in \u201937, things became too uncomfortable, and I went to the Jewish school. I still measure [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know what -- if you know what that is, it\u2019s a little more than the metric. Some of my children from my school got two years credit in college here for what -- our exam. Yeah. Many of those who got a lot of credit were veterans. So they, of course, they were very helpful. When I sent my paper to Washington, or Albany I think it was, they didn\u2019t get too hysterical about it. I didn\u2019t get credit, but I never studied for credit. I only took the courses I needed for my work. [indecipherable] jumped ahead. Then, in \u201939, we were told that the -- no, I think I want to tell you about the 10\" of November, that was the Kristallnacht."

            "question": "But before we get there, I'd like to spend a little bit more time on your childhood, and your schooling. You just mentioned that when you were younger, you went to -- you implied that you went to a mixed school of Germans that were non-Jews, and Jews. Could you tell us more about that? How did the children get along?",
            "answer": "Before Hitler, fine, they didn\u2019t know the difference, you had friends all over. Once Hitler came, those who were your friends, were your friends, but they wouldn\u2019t invite you any more, you wouldn\u2019t invite them. It was difficult, it got stranger. The last year that I was in the Catholic school, I was the only Jewish girl in my class. Lunchtime, nobody talked to me. I was -- it wasn\u2019t that they didn't like me, but they were afraid. Their fathers had positions in the Nazi party, and she has a Jewish girlfriend? They couldn\u2019t take the chance. But by that time, I was 17, and I really didn\u2019t like it there any more. As a matter of fact, there was a school in Berlin where the children of the em-embassies, American, English, would go and learn English, and speak -- get their own education, the British education. And I wanted to go there. I thought that would be the right thing to do. My parents didn\u2019t want me to do that because they thought if there\u2019s a quick emigration, I\u2019d be in Berlin, they\u2019d be in Breslau. They said, if you don\u2019t want to be in the -- in the Catholic school, go to the Jewish school. I was very happy there, I was one -- one among equals. I was relaxed, we had a lot of fun, until th-the Kristallnacht."

            "question": "H-How did you -- how did you understand what was beginning to happen? Did your parents speak to you about it? Did you speak with your parents when you got home, for instance from the school?",
            "answer": "I had the papers. They said this paper is not in the national interest, it will be suspended for two weeks. Well the two weeks are 60 years now. So I mean, I saw what\u2019s going on. Also, you had all these Hitler talks on the radio, and were -- this was a very noisy way of controlling people, they were marching along. But it did not really affect me so much. And when I was in the Jewish school, we had our own swimming pool. So what did I care? And that -- there was a -- a th-theater group, Jewish, concert Jewish. So the last year, when Hitler really was getting going, it was a cocoon, a ghetto. Which I didn\u2019t even mind, I was too young, I was happy. There were nice boys, there were nice girls. So what\u2019s wrong with that? And as I said, y -- that came to the Kristallnacht. Until that time, life was okay, I knew I would be leaving Germany, and everybody wanted to. But there was no hardship yet, thank God, that came after we left."

            "question": "C-Can you talk a little bit about homelife, even before Kristallnacht, really, the early 30\u2019s, the mid-1930\u2019s. Wh-What was it like to be in your house? What was your mother like? How -- how did your family spend time together?",
            "answer": "It\u2019s -- to tell you the truth, I took it so for granted, that I can hardly tell you. I went to school in the morning, I came home. It was a big nice apartment, and I -- in -- I remember once I left Germany, I had a shock. When you took your dirty boots off, they didn\u2019t come back clean by themselves. The cook did it, so -- I took that for granted. Th-There were so many things that I later thought, gee whiz [indecipherable] spoiled. I was not spoiled, because we were told to clean our room, to do this and that. But still and all, I remember one of the girls, one Jewish said to me, \u201cThis 1s a nice pin, 1s it real?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wear costume jewelry.\u201d And you know, these things stay with you. And one of the girls -- and also, as I said, before Hitler, invited me to her home. And I said, \u201cMom, you say these people are poor, they have five rooms, we only have six.\u201d So my mother said, \u201cHow big were the five rooms? As big as our living room?\u201d I learned. You know, it -- that\u2019s why when you asked me, it seemed so terrible away from it. I lived in the moon. And of course, anything I wanted I had. When te -- again my parents trained me. I know I wanted to have a writing thing like this, you know, with envelopes and everything. I bought it. But it was 15 marks maybe. My father said, \u201cNo. Poor children have to live on that for a week. You return it, and you get your money back.\u201d So I knew you can\u2019t just buy anything you wanted. But what you needed, you got plenty. So if you must -- 1f you remember my life before Hitler, if somebody who lived not on Park or Fifth Avenue, but on the Upper East Side, going to the schools that you knew and knowing the people you were supposed to know. But when you are 12 13, you are not [indecipherable] very often, nowadays they are more than then."

            "question": "Can you tell us some about your father? A-A-A-Again, during this pre-Hitler time, before a lot of anxiety had come about for the Jewish community?",
            "answer": "Well, my father was very well known. He wrote a column for the newspaper about anything new in laws. When the laws was the -- not Hitler law, he had a reserved column, whenever he wanted to write. He had the clients from here to there, very important cases. He was a very charming man, and a very good speaker. So he would tell socially anecdote about all the doctors and lawyers in Breslau. He was very well known at the -- by the judges. His word counted. I don\u2019t know if I should tell you one case that\u2019s really -- by that time Hitler was [indecipherable] already. There was a couple, an Austrian woman and a German man, and the laws were that -- I have to get this -- they wanted to get married. And the laws are, you have to go by the marriage laws of your home country. The woman was Austrian and Catholic, and couldn\u2019t divorce and marry that man. So they had many cases, I mean, they tried it, no. Then my father got the case, and my father, as a Jew said, I think I have an angle. It is important to the German country to have strong German children. If you keep that woman from marrying the man, having children, then it is against the national interest and the Austrian law should not apply. My father won the case. The judge said, \u201cAs a Jew, you really made a case.\u201d My father said, \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer.\u201d The joke was, she was over 45. No children. It\u2019s just one of the stories that I remember. But I mean, he had an angle. He knew what -- and it -- he wasn\u2019t sarcastic, he had a client and he worked for it. He also said -- and that is very different from lawyers here, for every marriage, divorce, he reunited half the people. He said it is not right to take money if you can protect a life. Another thing I remember from my father as a young lawyer, he worked -- he was associated with a much older man. They went for a com -- how shall I say? It was -- it [indecipherable] of a contract they were working on. They spent five hours on that. Eventually they hashed it out. My father and his mentor went back to the office. The older man opened the drawer, took out the contract which was almost exactly what they came to. He had written that before. And he said to my father, when you argue with people, or have a contract with them, you\u2019ve got to remember their point of view. You don\u2019t say it in the beginning, but you have to know how far you can come to make them meet. I wish they had it now in a few places. So, I mean, my father had a very solid background, but my mother said she used to go to court when he was pleading, sit in the back and monitor it. She would tell him what the reaction was of the people, also whether his voice carried. I was too young. I would have loved to go because I was always fascinated by the law, and as a kid I was reading all his law books. Some of them weren\u2019t so kosher. I mean, some of them had things there that [indecipherable]. So I learned a lot. I used to tell the other kids what was going on, you know, things that nowadays you read it in every book, but in those days -- my parents didn\u2019t mind. They always felt that what I can learn, okay. As a matter of fact, I had a reputation. My mother used to say -- and then 40 years later the people in my office said it, you cannot keep secrets from Ruth. My mother said to my father, \u201cIf -- she will always find out and tell everybody. But if you tell her it\u2019s a secret, she not say peep.\u201d And that was from when I was 12 til I was 80. Well, it was funny."

            "answer": "I see, yeah. Well, I tell you, my father had been -- I mean, everybody came from a religious family, that really -- they were. My father, as a student had been at the fraternity that was not Jewish. Most of the Jewish professionals, lawyers, had belonged to -- I forgot the name, what -- casaya, I think. My father was not. I don\u2019t know if you know then, students fought with [indecipherable] and he had a star. As a matter of fact, when my father died here, he had collapsed and was in the hospital, and a very nice doctor took care of him, but he was very aloof. They thought he was a German Nazi. As it turned out, when we -- when my father died, they asked if we would allow an autopsy, and my sister said, \u201cYes, but the funeral mustn\u2019t be delayed because we are Jewish.\u201d That man fell over. He said, my God. I mean, he had been professional, but he\u2019d rather not. But I [indecipherable] get into details about it. But this was -- my father didn\u2019t look Jewish, he had a very -- I wouldn\u2019t say arrogant, but dominating. When he came in, you knew it. And one time that I was still in Breslau, a woman came up to me and said, \u201cAre you Ruth Zellner?\u201d And I said yes. She said, \u201cI recognized you by your father\u2019s walk, and by your mother\u2019s red hair.\u201d This was red. So you know it -- people knew us. My mother came from a much more Orthodox background. My great-grandfather, her grandfather was a cantor and very - very well known too. So when they married, of course as a student, my mother was free will -- I mean, a respectable lady, but it was unusual to be a student. But she said she wanted a Jewish home, so we had a kosher home. Passover dishes and all this. And I hated Passover because my grand -- great-grandfather, the cantor, made it last forever. And I couldn\u2019t understand. He [indecipherable] the maid took me home early, but not early enough for me. Then my father come back the Seder after my great -- great-grandfather died, then he made it very interesting. And he -- sometimes in -- you know, during the end of the -- rather the beginning of the Hitler time, many people realized that there were Jews who hadn\u2019t much of an idea. So we would invite these people to let them join in a Seder, they\u2019d never seen such a thing. And my father always -- he doesn\u2019t just [indecipherable] down this thing, he would stop and make very interesting comparison, so it was a very nice Seder. He died right after the Seder on Passover many years later. So Seder has -- now I don\u2019t like it so much any more. So the -- otherwise, my parents were members of the Jewish community. There were Jewish clubs, even before Hitler. The B\u2019nai Brith, and the Society of [indecipherable] and of course on the high holiday, people went to synagogue or dressed up with their prayer books, until Hitler came. Then you didn\u2019t dress up, you didn\u2019t have -- show your prayer book, you just sort of sneaked in into a little something. There were several synagogues in Breslau, Orthodox, I don\u2019t think you would call of a member of the Reform -- not even Conservative, it was a Modern. Very nice rabbis and a beautiful building, burned down."

They could not burn that down because too many Nazis lived around the houses there. But ours -- I may even have a picture. Gee, I didn\u2019t think of it. Maybe when we have a lunch break. What a beautiful building. And weddings, I remember the older sister of a friend of mine, who had a wedding that was still before Hitler became to -- too much of a nuisance, with the long, white velvet gown, marching down for a mile, like Saint Patrick\u2019s. This -- but of course, that stopped too. Otherwise -- I mean, we were part of the Jewish community, and there was a Jewish community paper, and I remember they had a lot of family announcement of course, you know how it 1s, it is like patting on your shoulder, the big shot this and the big shot that. And they also lived that, the little boys who became Bar Mitzvah. And when I saw the big brother of my girlfriend was listed, I was so grown up. Then, after awhile, the older sisters of my friends got engaged, more grown up. I must have 10 years [indecipherable]. And these papers were very nice. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of the Aufbrau. That was formed here in the early 30. And here too, they had announcement of things that happened in the Jewish immigrant community, and people -- also after the war -- I want to go ahead on that now, when people came over from the camps, they would have long lists of newcomers, where relatives could meet again. Well, now they have a few obits. And that\u2019s just the way it goes, it\u2019s also 60 years. But I remember the Jewish -- Breslau Gemeindeplatt. It meant, the community, the Jewish community of Breslau. That was pretty cohesive. I\u2019m not sure how many people were there, but it was a lot. They are gone."

You are being examined in three or four things, and one you can choose because you think you are most interested in. So I had chosen German literature. And by that time the Jewish school was not allowed to conduct its own exams any more. We had to have one of the Nazi big shots supervise the whole thing. He was great. He was wonderful. You know, that was always -- they were such nice people, but they -- most of the time they\u2019re afraid to come out. Now this one examined me, and everybody was laughing because I really felt so at home with [indecipherable] and Schiller and all that stuff. I don\u2019t know how much you know about them. So I\u2019m saying that to show how integrated we were. And the -- some of the Nazi -- none of the Nazi teachers I had in the Catholic school were evil, because the religion balanced that. They were high in the party because they had to be, but when they could help you, they did. But God forbid it would come out. That would have hurt them, and also their families. So that was one of the reason that people went along. They did try to have -- when I get to the -- the 10\" of November, I'll tell you some of that. Do you have enough of my first chapter?"

We knew the non-Jewishness by having books, all the German literatures, and we were supposed to read it. I mean, they didn\u2019t sit down and say this is that and this is this. A few weeks ago, I saw an obit in the Times that a man [indecipherable] died. He was the son of a very important Weimar official. I don\u2019t think he was the president, but he was a chancellor or so. [indecipherable] all the Jews voted for him. There was some [indecipherable] who was a Jew, and had -- I don\u2019t remember which position. So they were in the highest government position between \u201824 and \u201833. I don\u2019t know if you know about the inflation. After the war, the German money wasn\u2019t worth anything, if you had a suitcase full of money. My father said he would get paid with shoes for me, because when people got paid, they went to the bank, it wasn\u2019t worth anything, million, billion. Then von Schacht, who was later on a Nazi, straightened things out and in \u201924 it stabilized, and between \u201924 and \u00b032, there were many important Jews in the government, in art, in the Berlin, the plays, the music, many names that came over here eventually. It was a very blooming, blooming positive thing, and we were part of it. My mother and father went to the theater, they told us what the big plays were. So we were never -- we never sat down and got told the facts of life, I don\u2019t mean that this way, but we just lived it. I don\u2019t know how that is here with the rich people, but we were very close. My parents were not -- I mean, they had the big social life, but we were part of that [indecipherable] their children.

I had a bad cold and wasn\u2019t going to school the next day. And I said, gee tomorrow they are all going to talk about it. When I come back the next day nobody will talk any more. Well, one time I was wrong. Well, the nec -- the day after when I went to school a friend of mine came running up the stairs, you can\u2019t go to school, there\u2019s a pogrom. It was not on the radio, but -- not yet. So I went back home, and one of my father\u2019s sister was a widow. She lived in Breslau and she had visited her sister somewhere else. And my mother, as I said, she was a very forward looking person, has said to her sister-in-law, give me the keys to your apartment in case I have to hide my husband. So she and Father went to that apartment. There was no man there so they wouldn\u2019t be looking for anybody, and then my mother came back. Two friends of my father came over and said they were going to drive to the Sudetenland. This was right after Chamberlain had made the Munich arrangement and given the Sudetenland to hit -- to Hitler. And these three men figured that the Nazi organization wasn\u2019t set up yet. It was just two or three weeks later, so that\u2019s where they drove. It was about four hours, maybe, three hours from Breslau. And one of the men [indecipherable] a priest and asked him for asylum. The priest said sure, you can -- anybody who is against Hitler can stay in my house. But the next morning he said, \u201cI am not a favorite of the Nazi, they may search here, I\u2019m going to take you somewhere else.\u201d He took the three men to a nunnery. The nuns were very nice. Really. You know, honest people are nice, never mind what religion. My father and the two other men were there for maybe four days. Were very comfortable, good food. And as -- it was entertainment for the nuns, too. Then they heard that the action was over and they came back to Breslau. Did you take the receiver off again? No. Because [indecipherable]. When they came back to Breslau they contacted my mother to find out if it was safe to come home. My -- the men were in the car from there, and my mother did something that she said was the hardest thing she ever did. When my father was gone a Gestapo man came, looked over the apartment, didn\u2019t find my father, said, \u201cWell, when he comes back have him report.\u201d So my mother took all the papers for emigration and said to my father, \u201cWe are going to the Gestapo to report.\u201d She made sure that she went to the wrong room. And there there was a decent guy, he said, \u201cThe aktion 1s over, go home.\u201d And my father said, \u201cMark the record, I have reported as required.\u201d So when they came home, my parents told this nice maid to talk to all the neighbors in the whole block, that my father has been released from the Gestapo. Otherwise somebody would have asked -- would have said, for brownie points, you know, he is here, take him. So this way, he got away from it. We also -- school was closed. I was in the Jewish school by that time. The windows of the Jewish stores were smashed. People were picked up if they looked Jewish and taken to concentration camps. So by that time we knew, never mind what, we had to get out. When school opened, all the teachers had been in the camp, and when they came back, they were so thin, and so young looking because many of them had beards, and they were shaven. We didn\u2019t recognize them. And one man whose father was also -- I mean, one boy in my class, his father was also a prominent lawyer, very impressive looking, was taken to a camp. And when the boy came to school he said, you know this morning I woke up, there was a bum in my bedroom, and it was my father. He had just come from the camp, he wanted me to see him like that. I mean, it was such a horrible thing. I knew one man was arrested in the street, and so was his son, but they didn\u2019t know about it, they met in the camp. The son had -- he came down with pneumonia, and the father was trying to help him as much as possible. They told the father he can go home. And the father said, I would like to stay til my son is out of danger. If you don\u2019t go now, you cannot get out. So he left, he had a wife and an -- two daughter. And a week later they brought him the ashes, they brought in a -- what they call these things, they\u2019re -- urn."

At that time, at the end of \u201938, it was very hard to get out. One thing was strange. Another sister of my father, also a widow, was at home reading when the door was smashed open, two SA men came in, heil Hitler, heil Hitler. Who are you? And she stammered her name.

I don\u2019t know if they could tape phones at that time, but still and all, we had no idea. We were optimistic because, as I said, the Sudetenland was not integrated yet into Germany. But after he came back, and after the aktion was over, we never felt comfortable. Also, the smashed shop windows were not being repaired. The people either didn\u2019t have the money, or they were in the camp. I mean, what could you do, so you walked along the street with the boarded houses, the synagogue had been burned as I told you. And everybody was trying to get out. It was not yet that they had to wear the Jewish star, that came later. Also, it was not yet where people couldn\u2019t sit on benches in parks. That was after I was gone. But you knew that things were coming, nobody knew how horrible, but still and all. So Cuba had asked I don\u2019t know how much money for visa. They thought they could make it a good business, and people would wait there til the American quota came up. And we had an ship, the Saint Louis, which was a luxury ship. She was scheduled to cruise from New York to Bermuda all summer long, back and forth. Well the -- figure, if we get the 900 Jews on this ship, and -- it\u2019s a free ride. So we got on, and it was a beautiful ship."

We were -- th-the scheduled ship was two weeks later. They had one in April and one later in June. Every month there was a regular ship, but this one left on the 13\" of May, and the travel agent said, I can get you on it. The preparations, you could not take your own things with you without getting permission. Permission manager had to list everything you had, and what you paid for it. Some things my parents bought after they married, you had to put an approximate amount down, and pay the thing over again, as an exit visa. When you packed, there were the Gestapo in the house, with a list that you have sent, and watched what you took. And some peoples tried to smuggle jewelry also. Well, that was the end of it, if they s - if he saw it. We did not. We packed and that big, fat guy was standing there, but he was reasonable. I mean, he was not [indecipherable]. And we put everything into a lift van that was on the Saint Louis. However, when we couldn't land, they shipped the lift back to Germany, and from England we wanted it out, it went to Rotterdam, it was bombed. That\u2019s why I have no pictures.

My father had so much money that he were permitted to take, I don\u2019t know, maybe five percent out of the country, which also went to Cuba. Cuba sent it back to Germany. What did we need it for? We eventually got it to England, but because it came as German money to England, we couldn\u2019t take it out when we came here. Then we left, right and left. I mean, 1t wasn't only the Germans who were mean. The same thing happened -- I mean, Cuba was horrible, too. And the English could have let us take our money out.

And I used to say that somebody may polish their shoes, they don\u2019t shine. What doesn\u2019t shine is gold. Who would know? Well, we tried, but it didn\u2019t work out. My father put some diamonds into a hammer. It\u2019s gone. We really only came here with 40 dollars a person, and we were happy about it. But we are not here yet. So we got on the ship, and we didn\u2019t know it, we thought we were away from Germany, but the ship was still German country, I mean, you know, the nationality of the ship was the German. And the fireman, we found that out later, where the Gestapo keeping track of not only the passengers, but of the crew. They were scared, too. They had been told to be polite, but no contact with the passengers. The captain was not supposed to join the passengers, no captain\u2019s table, or so.

So he and I left, while my mother and sister still worked with the [indecipherable]. They were to come to Hamburg couple of days later. I know when we went to Berlin, my father went in the dining room, and Jews were not supposed to do that. I wouldn\u2019t go with him. I was so scared. Nobody thought he was Jewish, as I told you, he didn't look it, he didn\u2019t act it, but I was sitting in that stateroom, I couldn't wait for him to come back. I thought it was mean of him to put me through it, but he -- he was -- he was leaving. It could have messed it up completely. But we got to Berlin and he went to that banker, and one of my father\u2019s brother lived there with his wife, and we went over to say good-bye. And a friend of mine I had gone to school with was in Berlin wa -- I told you, where you learn English and she wa -- became a correspondent in English, French and Spanish. She was very knowledgeable. So she came by to say good-bye. I never saw her again. They went to Bolivia and [indecipherable]. But -- so we spent the afternoon and when my father saw on the timetable that there was a train leaving for Hamburg, he says, might as well. That was funny. We had two rooms, because my mother was coming, my sister was coming, and we walked around in Hamburg, I don\u2019t know if you know it, very famous red light district. But it was -- I mean, people were drunk there, 1t was more like a Coney Island. And I was walking with my father, I was 18, and we were f -- a woman came over to my father. And he laughed and he waved her off. How can she come up here when I am there? That was funny. So, he spent the night, the next morning we went to meet my mother and sister, and we waited. We were fo -- I\u2019m trying to remember, I think we came over there on Monday, and the ship left on Friday the 13\". So we were there -- there for a night, with a Hamburg, and ni- they have -- I don\u2019t know if you have heard of that, the [indecipherable] canal, just like Lincoln tunnel. I don\u2019t know from where it goes to where, but some very nice guy walked us through and showed it to us. And I was so impressed that you can walk under the water under the river. I had no idea that I was going to go to the [indecipherable] through the Lincoln tunnel every damn day for many years. And another thing, my father wanted to give us a treat. And there was a Tierpark. That is not a zoo, but [indecipherable] for the wild animal. They caught them, kept them and sent them to where this circle zoo. And I hated it. It was smelling like all out. I have never gone to a zoo again. But it\u2019s still out there, but not me. So then they said we should report on that, and there I can show you pictures, maybe we do that later. [indecipherable] get too interrupted. When we were up on the gangway with 59 people [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable]. And we had the room for the four of us. My parents had the lower berth and my sister and I, because there was no more room, it was full up, we were lucky we got on, very -- we didn\u2019t know how luc -- lucky. And we were -- and we had a table for ourselves, the four of us, and Friday evening the band started to play -- you wouldn\u2019t know -- you -- you don\u2019t speak German, do you? One of -- that was you play when you go, good-bye, and the ship pulled out."

            "answer": "It was a relief time. We thought we were out of it, which we were not. We found that out. Well, we thought we were free to go. And there were many people who have come from concentration camps right on the ship. And they, of course, were happy. The trip out, you have to imagine like any other cruise now. The crew -- the crew was helpful. You got your bouillon, you got your this, you got your that. Suddenly you were the way it used to be 15 years before. When we came to Cuba on Saturday, they said it was weekend, we were too soon, they were not prepared to land that. We believed it. Not very smart, but anyway. We were very near to the Havana, and you probably studied that, people who were in Havana already went on little boats that cruised around the Saint Louis. Sometimes it was a parent, husband, and the other one, they\u2019re on the ship, they would holler up, we would holler down. And they would say, be calm, you'll all get down, be calm. We didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know what it meant. I mean, we wouldn\u2019t fall down the gangway, would we? But until Monday, we accepted the situation. When we didn\u2019t get down on Monday, it -- we became suspicious. And then the American Jewish Joint swang into action. They tried to bribe the Cuban government with, I think, I don\u2019t remember how much, 2,000 dollars for each passenger, an awful lot of money. But there were two thing that were against the Cuban giving in. One was, there was a quite a good connection with the Nazi. There were a lot of them up in Cuba, and they thought of [indecipherable] down. Also the one who had signed our visa was in disgrace, for no particular reason, we took too much money, so did everybody else. So they were very stubborn about it. One day, [indecipherable] two of us sitting on deck when a man came running from the bathroom, his wrists slashed, bleeding all over, jumping overboard into the harbor. He was from Breslau, I knew him and the children very well. The harbor police fished him out. One of the sailors went after him to save him, which really was tremendous. He went to Havana into the hospital. They would not allow his wife or children to join him. They had to go back to England. We lived near where we did, at the hospital when he was well, a month later came too."

And we are waiting, and at night everybody woke up because the ship was running full steam ahead. And everybody thought they were in Europe already, you know, we -- something was put over, we were sitting there in daytime and rushing where at night?

And the captain explained that there were negotiation between us and San Domingo, and another part of Cuba, and I don\u2019t know what, and he was heading for a spot that was equidistant, so when the solution came we wouldn\u2019t lose any more time. And di -- at that time the captain felt that about a half a dozen men would be a liaison between the passenger and him. My father was one of them, so he was very busy. We were cruising around, and came very close to Miami, I remember the palm trees, it looked so pretty. But at that time Miami wasn\u2019t what it\u2019s now, that was much later. We thought maybe we could get there, but the Coast Guard came with guns, so we left. And -- what I said to you before, some of the women, my mother signed a letter to Mrs. Roosevelt, whether she could help. Didn\u2019t work. Understand that is in the Holocaust in Washington, may not be on display any more. So we were cruising around and there -- we got all kinds of telegrams, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get off the -- eh -- and they -- forever they said you will not have to go back to Germany, that was the repeat all the time, which of course nobody believed any more. But one interesting thing was the crew, who had been told not to be friends with anybody, got very upset. Whenever there was a meeting there were two or three in the back to report to the others. And they said, what\u2019s going on in Germany? We are on the ocean, we don\u2019t know. One of the sailors got involved with a Jewish girl. And the [indecipherable] the Gestapo knew very well, so he killed himself. They found him hanging in his cabin. So they were really taking their life in their hand to be sympathetic to us. And the -- the captain told my father, I don\u2019t know if other people knew it -- later on I read it in books. He said, if we have to go into the English channel without a chance to go anywhere but Germany, he would [indecipherable] the ship at the coast o -- coast of England, and then we would be shipwrecked and they would have to take us in, and to hell with the ship. It was some thing. I mean, that man was unbelievable. Luckily, by the time we got into the channel, the Jewish Joint had convinced England, Belgium, France and Holland to take in 200- some people. We landed in Amsterdam -- not land, I mean we berth -- berthed in a -- and Mr. Tropper -- and his name should be honored. He had -- was the one who really did everything from the Jewish Joint. He came up with representatives of the four countries, and one of the little girls came and said she was sorry she couldn\u2019t give him flowers, but she thanked him for ret -- saving all our lives. That woman, as a matter of fact, is quite active in talking about the Saint Louis. So when they made up lists, my sister and I helped, for the passengers who traveled together, but didn\u2019t have the same name, like a couple with a mother-in-law, because they shouldn\u2019t be split up. The four countries had certain requests. I know Holland wanted single men because they had [indecipherable] could take care it better there, and they expected a war. They could have a few more soldiers. I don\u2019t know what Belgium wanted, France. The lucky ones were England because a year later Hitler had run over the other countries, and many of the Saint Louis people were killed. And we -- he -- something funny happened, we -- our first and -- was it Antwerp? I\u2019m not sure, we didn\u2019t get off there. And there was a big ship in the back of us, going to Chile, and somebody called my name. Was a girl from my school, she was on her way to Chile I was coming back from Cuba, and a -- a -- you know, these little things are so -- they illuminate how crazy everything was. Then they announced on the intercom certain names that were going to Holland. Belgium first, and then the others went to Holland. They were -- they\u2019re only half of it.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in any danger, you do what you have to do and then afterwards you collapse. Then it hits you how close you were to catastrophe. And that\u2019s the way it was on the ship. I remember I annoyed some people. I said very innocently, I dreamed last night that we had the Christmas party on board. And that was in June. Nobody liked my smart [indecipherable] remark, but I didn\u2019t even think. But I was still about 18 -- yeah, 18 in \u201939. So -- so there we were on a little freighter, we were about 400 people still, and the Saint Louis took off for America, for the cruises. And the crew lined up on deck, and said good luck to the Jews, which was something. And they told us, we are so glad we don\u2019t have to go back to Hamburg, we are going to New York and we cruise to Bermuda, and in the fall when we come back to Germany, everything will be forgotten. Been not forgotten in 60 year."

You know, when -- when they was no -- no help. You are trapped, especially on a ship. And also there was a question about food, and [indecipherable]. The food was sufficient, but the last few days they didn\u2019t give us so many choices. In the beginning it was a first class ship, you could choose from six entrees.

By the time I realized that they really were very helpful, we were gone. So then we went on a freighter first to France, where 250 people got off, and the freighter had very few cabins. Most of all that in where the freight used to be, there were bunk beds maybe three, four high, you had to climb up. And you could just roll out of bed and have breakfast because the tables were there, too. A few cabins were reserved for my parents and the other men from the committee. I feel appreciation for they had done. But the rest of what there was, one freight room for men, and one for women. You had to climb down the ladder to get in, and we were mean. When you sit downstairs and people come down the ladder, you see their legs first. And we had bets up to the knee, what legs are coming down, except one woman, she had ankles like that. No bets on her. You know, and we -- with all the commotion, we kids had some fun. Never -- as a matter of fact on the ship I was walking around with one guy, he was very friendly. And I was friends with another guy. And one day when I was walking with one on deck, the other one came and said hello. And it turns out they were brothers. I didn\u2019t know that. There I was flirting with two, and it was all very nice."

            "answer": "Well, when we got to England, we had no chance to do anything, they did for us. There was -- they called it the Rowan house, that took care of refugee, they ar -- are -- it\u2019s when we got off the ship we were given a number by one of the -- I guess, social worker. She said, this is the number of your train car, and this is the number of the bus that will meet you in London. So that\u2019s what we did, and the bus took us to a little pension, you know a little hotel, mostly students were there, and we had a room arranged for by the Rowan house for one week. And my father [indecipherable] got sick. My mother asked if we could stay longer, they said no. They probably thought we were just telling them. In the meantime we found out that my uncle from Breslau had arrived in London, and we found out where he was. And we went -- he was in what you call a brownstone, I don\u2019t know what they have in Washington, here in New York they have the refurnished brownstone houses, and the -- the rooms are rented out to people, each room -- not apartment. And he and his wife and son had one room, and here -- the landlady gave my parents a room, but she had no other space, she said she would in two weeks, and my sister and I were in another building that belonged to her, under the roof. It was slanted attic and there we were, and what impressed me was, in Havana, where in daylight, 1t was pitch dark and in 15 minutes was bright sunshine. That was near the equator. In England, dawn and dusk were [indecipherable | especially during the war when they had daylight saving, you could read at 11 o\u2019clock. I like that. So there we were in England, and after a month, I got a job doing millinery work. I put labels into the hat, by appointment to her majesty the queen. I\u2019m sure she never wore my hat. I wasn\u2019t very good at it. And then came the war, September \u201939 [indecipherable] arrived in June. [indecipherable]. By August we knew. I went sightseeing on Saturday after work, but most of the things were buried already for safekeeping. Children were taken away from London. Things were getting ready, but not as ready as they should have. When the war started, I was working in that millinery, and one of the girls said, did you know that trouble had started? And I said, trouble, does that mean war? She says, yes. So in those let -- last few days the ambassadors went back and forth, but then it was war. They called it the blitzkrieg, they thought the Germans would come like this, which didn\u2019t happen, and they made fun of it and called it the sitzkrieg, they were sitting. But by April -- my factory kicked me out, they weren\u2019t busy any more and me he could do without. And in the spring, of course, Hitler ran over Belgium and everything. And at that time, the English were afraid that among the refugees there would be Nazis hiding as refugee, and all -- most of the men were put into camps, my father, and everybody. So he was -- I think it was the Isle of Mann where he was, from June, July, August, September, three month. In the meantime the blitz had started. Every night the bombs came down when it got dark until it got daylight. And of course as the la -- nights got longer, the bombs went. We -- I know we were- one time we were standing in the basement, sitting there, and the house was shaking, and I was thinking, I hope the ceiling will stay up. If the ceiling stays up we\u2019ll be alright. Then, after the all clear, you went around looking what houses weren\u2019t there. And my father came back in September, and he managed to get passage for us to come to the State, which was very hard to get. I mean, the ships were being sunk, and they needed ships. So we went to Liverpool and went on board. Blackout. You couldn\u2019t go on deck with [indecipherable] doors, because you know, you couldn\u2019t even smoke on deck because a light carries very far in the ocean. We had air raid alarms. Mostly they were just tests, but sometimes you could hear planes, and you didn\u2019t really know where, what. So we went -- I think it took about more than two weeks. There were three groups of people on the ship. Children with their mothers or their nannies, that came to Canada for safekeeping. And some refugees, and a whole batch of young men who just came on board. No paper, no nothing. Well, what we find out, we were full -- I think two full crews for ships, which Roosevelt had promised Churchill cash and carry. They picked up the ships in New York and take them back to England. So, I remember one thing, everything was blackout and no -- no identification. And when we were near Halifax, there was a fog and an old English man said, well, when the king and queen came to Halifax, they were befogged too, so it\u2019s all right. And I was standing on deck with some guy and we saw the captain come out. We hadn\u2019t seen him before, because I mean, it was a heck of a job getting the ship over. And he was looking up and saluting, and we saw it was the Union Jack wave, and that meant we were in Canadian waters, and we\u2019d done it. Now that moment I will never forget, because on that ship, you [indecipherable] you never got undressed. You had your lifebelt, you had your winter coat, and your boots. You had to have the winter coat in case you went into a boat. You had to be able to throw it off in case you went into the water. Same thing with the shoes. I mean, that was another scary ride. I didn\u2019t take a cruise until years later. But we were in Halifax, we -- they took on foo - food, and oil. And then we sailed down to New York. I didn\u2019t see the Statue of Liberty. We had to be showing our papers downstairs, and when we got off, there was a man from the HIAS. I don\u2019t know if you know that [indecipherable] on Esther Place, I think it\u2019s still there. They would take newcomers in who had nobody to meet them. Most of them had some relatives, we didn\u2019t. So he took us down to the HIAS, and that was really scary, I was scared. We were sitting there, they told us to wait. It was it -- two days before Thanksgiving. And the two men came over from Vienna. And my parent -- my sister and one of the guys went out one door for a little walk, and I went out another door with that guy who was very scruvy looking. Unshaven. He walked me around and around. I said, I want to go back. He wanted to sh -- he wanted to show me something. I was say, gee whiz, I can\u2019t even tell the cops where I am. I didn\u2019t have an address, what was going on? But he wanted to show me Woolworth. In those days, for one dollar, you could buy candies, and stocking, and stationery, everything was a dime or 15 cents. I was overwhelmed. Then he took me back. But it -- it\u2019s very uncomfortable. So we were in the -- that was Tuesday we arrived, Wednesday we went down to Times Square where the Jewish organizations were. I was very disappointed. Times Square in daylight was very scruffy, even then. And the woman who took our particulars said we should come back on Monday because tomorrow is Thanksgiving, we won\u2019t work, and Friday we don\u2019t work. What was Thanksgiving, we didn\u2019t know. So she gave an -- an appointment for Monday. And I -- my sister and I, we went back to the HIAS, and my parents went to see that cousin, and -- who invited us for Thanksgiving dinner next day. There were all kinds of family there, a big to-do. I don\u2019t know if you know -- your -- \u201cLife With Father\u2019? You don\u2019t know the play? That was new at the time. A whole string of redheads, Irish. And when we came in, they said, the Irish fam -- \u201cLife With Father\u201d. We didn\u2019t know what it was all about. So we met a cousin of mine and he took us out, and he said he had a friend who was in the employment agency of the [indecipherable] and we should go there, and she introduced us, we had coffee with her, and she said we should come on Monday and see if we could get a job. And we did. So we were there on Tuesday, on Monday we had a job. It was a -- two Viennese men were making gloves for the Army and Navy. And my sister sat on a little machine and made all those fingers. You had to make, I think 10 dozen pairs. You didn\u2019t believe it. It was piecework. And we were still in the HIAS because we -- everybody told us to leave New York. They said it would be better in a small town, a small community would take care of us. My sister and I, we sat there and my sister, she was a tough noodle, she sat next to the fastest person and matched. She became the fastest one in the group. I wasn\u2019t bad, either. So in those days, the minimum was 10 dollars a week. And she and I each made 18. That was a lot. And my -- we took work home for my mother to finish. We came home with big bags of gloves, and she finished it and we took them back. I mean, she didn't work all night, it\u2019s the next day. And so she earned some money. My father had all kinds of funny jobs in the beginning. He was working for a dental lab, delivering the false teeth. That\u2019s for the lawyer. But he was really terrific, he did whatever came, and after awhile he got a job as a bookkeeper, where he stayed the rest of the time. So between 18 and 18 and maybe my mother eight, my father maybe 12, that was, in those time, livable. But of course, we bought yesterday\u2019s bread, was cheaper. I went to my first movie after one year, on my birthday somebody took me. A date was an ice cream soda with two straws. I mean, it took doing. And at first I could not go to school because I was war work, so you had to work long hours. And once they did -- somebody told the Army and Navy, knitted gloves are no good, they wanted a -- what we made were liv -- knitted gloves with leather palm. But they wanted leather gloves with lining. All the soldiers in the ar -- [indecipherable] said ours are better, we have a better grip. But, government. So we didn't have government work any more, we made gloves for skiing, and that gave me a chance to go to school. And I went -- I don\u2019t know if you know it, on Lexington Ave. in [indecipherable] is part of City College, the Brandeis Institute, that\u2019s for business. I didn\u2019t take credit, but I learned. You know, auditor. And when I thought I was ready, I started in an office, very much at the bottom. I worked my way up, and my sister got married, and my father died in \u201956. He died on the last day when he retired, he didn\u2019t come home any more. He collapsed in the subway. We didn\u2019t know where he was. But eventually I co -- went to the police and declared him missing, and they found him in the Roosevelt hospital, he died the next day. That\u2019s where that doctor was who thought he was a Nazi. So that\u2019s how it went."

And you know, that reminds me of something else which really doesn\u2019t belong in here. When I was on a cruise to Alaska, they had Friday night service conducted by a priest. Was he ever careful. He was a lovely guy. It was the Fourth of July, which made it easy for him to preach, because Fourth of July is no religion. And one man who was knowledgeable Jewish, he said the Jewish prayer. He knew -- the priest also knew some Hebrew. It was quite an experience, because he conducted masses every day for the Catholic people on board. So, it was nice"

            "answer": "I don\u2019t think it was religion that kept my father and mother on. They were Jewish, and conscious Jews, but I don\u2019t think, at least I never remember that we had a prayer meeting. There may have been Orthodox people on board who had their meetings in their cabin, but we were medium religious, even when we were here. I mean, I now am what they call every day Jew, for the three holidays, I\u2019m a member of the synagogue, but I don\u2019t go often. If I had children I think I would have been more conscientious about teaching. But we were not that religious. There were many people who didn\u2019t even know they were Jewish until Hitler told them. They were so assimilated that it was a great shock for them. It was not for us, we knew we were Jewish. But I know -- I have one friend, she and her husband came from family who, as I said, they never knew they were Jewish until they got kicked out. They had a little son. When he was 12, he was wanted to be Bar Mitzvah. And they thought he wanted the party, he -- but he wanted, so for a whole year he had his dad take him to classes, and then there was a Bar Mitzvah with a lot of people who\u2019d never been in a temple [indecipherable] and that little guy got it. You know, religion is a very changeable thing. I\u2019ve seen people who were not religious, and their children married very religious, and the other way around. It -- I don\u2019t know how religious you are, whether you are an organized religion that makes you do certain things certain days. And I know, for instance, the Orthodox Jewish religion -- and there were these Orthodox Jews on the ship, they have to do things that way, whether it\u2019s kosher, whether it\u2019s Shabbat, it\u2019s a very -- I don\u2019t want to say constricting, because the people who do it don\u2019t feel it\u2019s constricting. I do. You know they -- their whole life is built around it. My family and I never were. My nephew is married to a non-Jewish girl who is very lovely. She knows more than he does by now. So 1 -- I always feel everybody should marry everybody else so they can\u2019t get mad at each other."

I feel it\u2019s much sadder those who died who never knew they were Jewish, who really were just told, you are Jewish and you drop dead. The ones who were Jewish and religious as you say, probably had an easier time. Th-That\u2019s what I think, I may be wrong. Gee, I feel like on a Freudian couch.

When I was in Germany, the young people didn\u2019t care anyway, and the old people said how come you speak German so well. I was with a tour from here. And of course they figured it out because I spoke German well, and I didn\u2019t know what a mark looked like, you know, the German money. And one day we were in Heidelberg. Have you been there? And in Heidelberg we were not allowed to have our tour guide, but a local woman to show us around. And she of course had my number. And she was my age, and I knew she must have been a young Nazi because at that age, she was 13, I mean, she didn\u2019t have a choice. She came over to me, she asked me how I was doing, what I was going, how I had lived in America. It was very nice. And I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of it, in Heidelberg, that\u2019s where the students are. They have an enormous -- a beer keg, and they open the keg and everybody gets a glass. And she calls me to open the keg. [indecipherable]. And I was thinking, gee whiz, I don\u2019t know what she did when she was 18. People are people, all kinds. But I was glad when I was out of the country. The older ones looked at me -- not this woman, but others, suspicious. I don\u2019t think they liked me to come back.

This is Havana, which at that time was a beautiful city, from what we could see, and we were very close. You see the little boat in the front. Relatives of the passenger would hire these boats, they would leave Havana and go around the ship two or three times, screaming up to their relatives, everybody was hollering for everybody, reassuring us, which didn\u2019t work, and we would ask question, what could be done, but we never got an answer because there was no answer.
