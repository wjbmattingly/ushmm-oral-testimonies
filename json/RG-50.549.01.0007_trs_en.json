Well, first perhaps -- let's go back just a little bit to, if you could talk a little bit about the circumstances leading up to the time of, of the liberation. What was, what was happening to you at that time in, you know, '44, '45\u00b0?",

            "answer": "Yeah. Well, approximately in the Fall of 1942, | was transported from ghetto to Auschwitz concentration camp -- | arrived with my mother, my sisters and my two brothers -- where, at the time of arrival, men and women were separate immediately and when it came to select, to separate men, to put them in the right places, me and my two brothers were approached by the, by the German officer. He pointed my brothers to one side and me to another side. Within twenty or thirty minutes, | found myself standing with all the men and young children. On the other hand, on the other side, | saw where my brothers were, were about 45 young men. Something told me that | am in the wrong spot, | didn't like where | am, | didn't know why. When the soldier passed Erwin Baum 2 December 5, 1995 Page 2 me by, | just ran across to where my brothers were. Later on, about 45, 50 boys were ordered to kind of slow running, jogging, went into Auschwitz. On the spot where | was, they went all to crematorium, they were gassed. So did my mother, my sisters. At that time, there were no women needed for labor, so all the women were gassed from that particular transport. When | arrived in Auschwitz, | was the youngest of the camper -- of about 18,000 inmates,\u2019 and | was the youngest."

            "question": "You know, in, in seeing the videotape and reading the transcripts, I, | was struck over and over again by that you seem to -- had a, had a sharp instinct for when there was trouble or when to take advantage of a situation -- you know -- such as that, such as that you were in this one place and you felt like something was wrong and so...",
            "answer": "There are a few, few moments like that you mention, in my life, kind of miracles. For instance, prior to arrive in the camp, as it is well known that | was raised by Dr. Janusz Korczak? in the orphanage, where | spent some years. Many times, while German occupation on the ghetto, | had the chance to go out of the ghetto, over a wall or by a certain tube or by the way of a sewer, to go to the Polish side, where | did not look very much Jewish and | spoke very clear Polish, and the doctor used to give me a few zlotys ' During 1942, there were some 24,000 prisoners in Auschwitz.

And also | was torn apart, | didn't know whether to be with my mother, my whole family was hungry, or be with the children. So sometimes | spent nights with, with my mother, where also during the night | used to go over the gate to the Polish side and buy loaves of bread, throw over the gate, throw over the wall to my mother; she used to sell it. What | want to bring out, that one particular night when it -- they decided to evacuate the orphanage, to take the childrens to Treblinka, to gas chambers?, | was out of that ghetto, particularly that night. So, that happened to be what, one of the miracles that happened in my life, that | was not there at that night. When | arrived in there in the morning, the whole orphanage was gone, although | tried to join them and | was chased away by police that said, \"You're not Jewish, get lost.\" There was another, another instinct while in concentration camp. If one was quite awhile in concentration camp, you got known and if the -- a good job, a good kind of opportunity came along, naturally the older inmates got priority. So | had a good job. | was working in a, in a place sorting clothes and while you sort clothes from the people that arrive from, from, from, from Poland to Holland, to -- or France, you always found an extra bite, something to eat. So | was pretty content. One day this German woman, a Nazi, uniform, I'll never forget her name, her name was Berta, she was wearing these leather 3 On August 6, 1942, Korczak, the orphanage staff, and some 200 children were sent to Treblinka concentration camp in Poland.

And she pointed at me and my number was taken down by one of her helpers. Upon that, a request came from a camp that they need a few hundred men to build certain air strips. It was kind of emergency and they called the blockaltester*. From that barrack, his name was Heinz, a young man, he got along with me very good and he put me on the transport. | was very angry. | didn't Know why is he sending me away, when | have it good, when | have, | was not hungry. Well, | couldn't help it, my number was given and | had to go. Later on, when evacuation started, when the allies were approaching this concentration camp... all those camp were naturally liquidated, and | met up with this guy, with Heinz. | says, \"I'll never forget you, Heinz. Why, why did you do it to me?\" He says, \"Bubi\" -- he used to call me \u201cbubi>\u201d -- \"you know, you wouldn't be alive now.\" | says, \"What do you mean?\" \"Remember Berta? Remember she took your number down? Do you know why?\" | says, \"No, why?\" \"She wanted to make a bag and a pair of gloves out of your skin.\" Naturally, | was shook up very much and then, then | was grateful to him. So there was another miracle in my life."

            "question": "You had been transported to?",
            "answer": "| was transported fr... to many, many camps. From camp to camp, from camp to camp, because, as | said, the Germans were building little air strips, so always a few hundred men were in a certain, out of a village, like they had a, they had a shack made out of metal and they kept us there. But on the last days of war, like maybe it's known already to you that they put all the inmates on a dead march, and | was among also them, a dead march. We were marching and marching and marching and marching, thousands of, of people, of men, thousands of them, and everyday there were less and less and less and less. They left a certain time, | don't remember, a few weeks, after marching once, they told us to sit down and have our break. It was no coffee break, by all means, they gave us a few cold potatoes to eat and then they said, \"Okay, let's go.\" Well, like the message passed from one to another, nobody would get up anymore. Like it was senseless, no use. So they got very angry and they ordered us to go up the hill and go against the trees and hands up. They said that they wanted to, to execute and also they gave the order, the, the high rank officer gave the order the soldiers, like \u201caim at the neck.\u201d And we heard that the guns -- you know, whatever they had to do -- we heard that noise and we keep our hands up and we wait and wait and wait and wait Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Erwin Baum 6 December 5, 1995 Page 6 and nothing happens, and then we hear one soldier looking through his binoculars said, \"Mine God, four kilometers from here are the Americans.\" We heard that, and we stay and naturally you stay so long with your hands up, you get a little tired, so you kind of, we kind of look back a little bit and we saw no more Germans. So we drop our hands, we turn around, no Germans. So naturally we run down the hill, and believe it or not the tanks and trucks were rolling and we ran and, \"Please, please, take us, take us, take us.\" Unfortunately, they had other orders than to take us and they passed by, they left us there, and the Germans came back and took us again. Took us again, put us in that camp and then not long we were liberated. We were liberated in, as | told you, in Allach when the allies came in, naturally they came in, they make pictures and everybody was running and asking, making motions with their hands for food, because we didn't know how to speak English. And they said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" but nothing happened, there was nothing there, and by that time the Germans left us a few days before. They were afraid and we were kind of sorry because like this, everyday we got a little bit whatever - we got. But like us, for three, four days, we got nothing, and the allies came and still there's nothing. But I, as | was used to sneak around and hassle to find always an extra bite, | went up on a -- it's bigger than a Jeep, kind of a little -- little truck, and | was looking, looking and | found and | ate a full box of what | thought it was chocolate and | ate a box of Ex-lax. | didn't know, | was happy, | found chocolate, | ate it and you could imagine what happened to me. I, | got very, very, very in bad shape, pain, and | walked Erwin Baum 7 December 5, 1995 Page 7 out of that, of that camp and there was this, on the road there was the field kitchen that the soldiers were fed, and | went and | was crying, \"Pain, pain, pain,\" and there was one American soldier of Russian descent and he spoke a little kind of broken Polish, and | told him that I'm so sick. So he put me in his car, in, in his Jeep, and drove me to town called Muhldorf, put me in a hospital. They put me in a hospital. Oh, that was beautiful. They fed me a Farina with milk and sugar for about two weeks, and I, | just walked out of the hospital and went on my own. | went on my own and went into a little, a little village called, it was Muhldorf, | forgot the name, and | met with two other friends from concentration camp and there were, and, and on a, on a farm with two German older sisters and they just, they thought that they have to take in, anybody that comes in they have to take in and take care of them."

Ampfing, that's the name, Ampfing, yeah. And we went to them and they took care of us, we ate and drank and they did our clothes. We were there for several months.

What was that experience like, those first couple of months? Were you elated or did it seem...?",
            "answer": "Well, those first few of months, why did we do those business, that kind of business, preparation, storage, buy food, put away, all in, in our mind was only not to be hungry, anymore. That's why we didn't want to wait, many of us, we didn't want to wait to get a handout, to wait from the UNRRA to give us something. | mean the first money came to my pocket and the first bakery | saw, | must have bought about thirty loaves of bread, and put it away. That was, you know, only in our mind, nothing else, nothing else mattered till later on, start, you know, we start to relive the whole bitter experience, try to look if anybody was left of the family, or whatever. And we came to Munich and got involved in business, doing business with, with the Germans, or with the Americans, kind of start, start, start a new life again. Till one day, | met somebody and | saw a number. By the number, we could identify which transport or which camp that person was, and | saw this number and | knew that he was in one of the camps where | was, which is Buna, and my brother was there. So | ask him, \"You must have been in Buna.\" He says, \"Sure, | sure was.\" \"Did you happen to know Icek Baum?\" He says, \"Sure, | know him. Here's his address. He survived. He's in Czechoslovakia.\" Now, you can imagine how | felt. Immediately, | ran to a, to a translator that wrote a letter to the government of Czechoslovakia and I'm looking, looking for this person. Unfortunately, the answer came that \u201cNo one like this is known by the name.\u201d During that time, my brother Icek -- and there's my older brother who wind up in Belgium, he was liberated somewhere and they went to Belgium -- thank God they found each other, and they were writing letters to each other and crying over my death. In the meantime, | was a \u00ae United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Erwin Baum 9 December 5, 1995 Page 9 hustler. | was successful in Munich. | was the first boy who could have a car, you know, | put a pillow under my seat so girls could see me and | was doing pretty well, and they were crying over me. But that never gave me any rest, that he told me my brother, and, and, and then | gave up hope. | said, \"Well, must have been a mistake or something.\" Well, one day my brother Icek from Czechoslovakia decided to join up with his brother in Belgium. So he had to leave Czechoslovakia, come to Germany and somehow go to Belgium. On the train going to, going to Munich, he met up with a girl and says, \"Why don't you accompany us to our camp?\" And so he spent sometime with her. She says \u201cOkay.\u201d On the train station, he meets again the same person who told me that my brother was alive. He says, \"Did you find your brother?\" \"Oh, come on, | have no brother.\" He says, \"Yes, you have a brother. He's got a golden tooth, wavy hair.\" Now, again, my oldest brother that did not survive had the golden tooth and wavy, wavy hair. But that didn't matter. But he brought them next day to me, you know, to Munich and | joined up with Icek and | says, \"Edyl didn't survive.\" He says, \"What do you mean, he didn't survive? He's in Belgium.\" So then, somehow, we got together, all three. | was very happy. Me, me and my brother Icek went to Belgium to be with my, with my, with my other brother, and we were in a home not, not doing much. But that didn't give me any rest. | used to go over the border, forth and back, back and forth to, to Germany, do a little business, and then one day | was caught on the border, you know, and Belgium gave me a deportation. | had to leave Belgium. So, somebody took me over to Luxembourg. | went to Luxembourg and while | was in Belgium, somebody from my hometown, from Warsaw, approached me. He says, \"Hey, you're 19 years old, you're just walking the streets, not doing nothing. Why don't you come to my place down, I, | have a fur shop. | put you down by the machine. If you learn the trade in two weeks, you have a job and you can make something.\" | says fine. So, | learned the trade and it was very useful, because when | went to Luxembourg they gave me a job by a furrier and | was working there, and then the war broke out in Israel and my brother from Belgium decided to go as a volunteer. So | figured, my brother's going, what I'm going do all alone here? | went to Israel also, as a volunteer and became a Navy man."

And while my brother was in Belgium, | got some connection with somebody who had connection with the Belgian consulate in Munich, and that man, that consulate gave to that man a list of names of people that did not survive. So we used that opportunity, because people didn't want to stay in Germany, Munich. They wanted to go. United States didn't open up the doors, yet. Canada, nothing happened. To Israel, nobody could go. So if there's opportunity to go somewhere, they wanted to go. So for 200 dollars, | was able to get an ID, piece of paper with a picture ID on the name of the person who perished in Belgium, and he could go home. So that person arrived in Belgium and Belgium the HIAS changed and gave him some, some papers. So we, we had the world and then, as when my turn came, | went to Belgium."

We used to say, \u201cHitler paid already.\u201d We Erwin Baum 12 December 5, 1995 Page 12 never stood in line -- like, like taking advantage of the situation. But after awhile, we calmed down.

Here, now, the Nazis, | thought were arrested and taken care of, and the children of them are regretting, and then they're feeling with us, they're nice to us.\u201d So you know, they try to brainwash us, and as a young person, from bad to good, you got kind of a little bit brainwashed and, and, and calmed down, you know."

If he wouldn't join the Nazi party, he would go also to concentration camp.\u201d And, and | saw these things happen because there were certain times where, where SS soldiers were brought to concentration camp for not fulfilling the orders that they received. | didn't know exactly what the orders were. Like one very high rank officer came to concentration camp and he was stripped of the uniform, put on concentration camp uniform, shaved the head, and we had to speak to him. He says, \"Well, | was a very high rank officer and | came home on vacation and my wife and the children were deported to a camp.\" He says, \"Why?\" Because apparently, his wife's grandfather descended from a gypsy. So that made her also a gypsy, they put in concentration camp. So he came back, he says, \"Who am | fighting Erwin Baum 13 December 5, 1995 Page 13 for?\" You know, so he came to concentration camp. So, this way the Germans of the war made us believe somehow that they were not completely to blame, that they were, were brainwashed, that, that circumstances brought them to that."

And there are people up to this day, thanks God, to verify it, you know. While we were working in camp, there was a certain Kommando. We used to clean up, it was called the clean-up commander like. People came by transport. They had to leave all the luggage and everything and we used to put it on trucks and then go to the other location. We sorted clothes here, this, that and a big b...box, put the money in there. But while helping the people coming off the train, there was a few boys of us, what told us to do, | don't know. But when we saw a woman, in the 60s, a woman in the 20s, 30s, holding a child, we asked them, \"Please have the child -- let your mother hold it.\". Why? A woman with a ch\u2014 an old woman had no chance, had to go. She was no, no, no good for labor. She had to go to gas chambers. A woman with a child -- because no children, no babies in camp -- go to gas chambers. But if we took the child and give to the older woman, we save the young woman -- she went to camp. Who told us to do? Why? No reason. We did it. There is one, there is one instant | experienced that | shall never forget for until | close my eyes. The end of 1944, Hungarian transports used to come.

If my cousin, whoever came, | knew he was going to die. Only looked if he has a piece of bread. Like from France or Belgium, they came. They used to bring sardines. We wanted a piece of salami. What happened to him will happen anyways. But here comes a transport and | do my thing. | see a girl, 18 years old, whether it was her baby or not her baby, | don't know. | say to, in Yiddish, \u201cGib dos kind tzu di mameh, un kim mit mir.\u201d'* She goes like this, she takes me by my shirt, she says -- and the, yeah, the people knew what's going on. The flames from the crematoriums were noticed on the ramp. People were putting on tallasim\u2019\u00ae -- \u201cShema Israel\u201d'\u00ae were praying and screaming and the Nazis were running around, calm down, calm down the people, calm down with the dogs, | mean. And this girl, like that. \"Look\" she says, \"I'm 18 years old. | didn't love in my life, yet. Why are you taking me to dead already?\" You know, if she would have put a knife in my heart, | would be happy. It got me so down. So | got to talk to her. \"No, no | don't -- it's no good for you to have the baby.

So, somehow | managed to surrender the baby and | managed to get her in the right place, where she went to camp, you know? = And a few weeks later, |, | kind of visited that camp. | had a way of getting in, to exchange with somebody else who was working there, and the girl got, got crazy in that camp. | thought | saved her life.
