My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program \"First\nPerson.\" Thank you for joining us. We began our 17th year of the \"First Person\" program\njust yesterday. Our \"First Person\" today is Mr. Manny Mandel, whom we shall meet\nshortly.\nThis 2016 season of \"First Person\" is made possible by the generosity of the\nLouis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher\nFoundation and the Helena Rubinstein Foundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.\n\"First Person\" is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust\nwho share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each\nof our \"First Person\" guests serve as volunteers here at this museum. Our program will\ncontinue twice weekly through mid August.\nThe museum's website at www.ushmm.org provides information about each of\nOur upcoming \"First Person\" guests. Anyone interested in staying in touch with the\nmuseum and its programs can complete the Stay Connected card that's in your program\nor speak with a museum representative at the end of the program. In doing so, you will\nreceive an electronic copy of Manny Mandel's biography so you can remember and share\nhis testimony after you leave here today.\nManny will share with us his \"First Person\" account of his experience during the\nHolocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows at the end of the\nprogram, we'll have an opportunity for you to ask Manny some questions.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are\nabout to hear from Manny is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared\na brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.\nManny Mandel was born to a religious Jewish family on May 8th, 1936 in Riga,\nLatvia. Manny was just 3 when World War II started in 1939. Although he was born in\nRiga, Latvia, Manny's family were Hungarian Jews. They had moved briefly to Latvia\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n2\nbecause of his father's work. Here we see a portrait of Manny's parents, Yehuda and Ella\nMandel holding their infant son Manny.\nShortly after Manny's birth his father accept add post as a chief cantor in\nBudapest and the family returned to hungry where they lived in 1933. Hungary is\nhighlighted on this map and Budapest is highlighted in yellow. Manny father was based it\nat the renowned Rombach Synagogue. In this picture we see Manny and his father on a\nstreet in Budapest. The Hungarian government passed anti-Jewish laws beginning in\n1938. In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis Alliance and in 1941 Hungarian troops joined in\nthe invasion of the Soviet Union. The war, an increasing restrictions, made for lives in\nJews in Hungary increasingly difficult. The photo on the left shows Manny outside his\napartment on his first day of school in 1942 in Budapest. On the right, we see a\ncontemporary photo of Manny standing outside the same apartment.\nGerman forces occupied Hungary in March, 1944. Manny and his mother Ella\nwere fortunate to be included in a program in which Jews would be transported to\nPalestine in exchange for trucks. Within months, they were transported by the Nazis to\nthe Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near Hannover, Germany in preparation for the\nevent actual departure from Europe. This is a historical photo of Bergen-Belsen.\nNegotiations for their transport to Palestine broke down and in December 1944,\nabout six months before the end of the war, Manny and his mother were released from the\nBergen-Belsen camp and transported to safety in neutral Switzerland. There they stayed\nat the Heiden Children's Home pictured here where Ella worked as a teacher. Manny is\nlying down in the front on your left and his mother Ella is standing in the back in the\nmiddle.\nAfter the war, Manny and his mother reunited with his father in Israel. They\nsubsequently immigrated to the United States and lived in Philadelphia. Manny is a\ngraduate of Temple University and did his graduate work at the University of\nPennsylvania. He is a clinical social worker. He met his future wife Adrienne in\nPhiladelphia and they were married in 1958. They have been married 58 years.\nAfter working for the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization in Cleveland and in\nMichigan, Manny and Adrienne moved to Washington, D.C. where Manny became the\nnational program director for B'nai B'rith Youth Organization. He would later go to work for\nthe Peace Corps before beginning his own psychotherapy practice in 1980. Manny retired\nfrom his practice in 2014. Adrienne's many accomplishments include having served in the\nMaryland Legislature as an elected member of the House of Delegates. She is the\nimmediate past-president of the Washington suburban san a tear commission, the nation's\neighth largest water and wastewater utility. Adrienne retired from the water authority just\nin 2014.\n| might also mention Adrienne for many years on the board of directors for the\ncenter of global aiming at Catholic University of America. Manny and Adrienne live in\nSilver Spring, Maryland. They have two children and three grandchildren. Their daughter\nLisa 26-year-old son Zachary graduated from the University of Maryland and their\n24-year-old daughter Gabrielle graduated from the University of Michigan and is now a\ngraduate student at John Jay University in New York. Manny and Adrienne's son David\nhas a 19-year-old daughter Alexandra who has been at the summer Bolshoi Ballet\nProgram in Julliard in New York. She graduated from high school in 2015 and attends\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n3\nGeorge Washington University. I'm pleased to say Adrienne, their son and daughter and\nnephew are all in the front row and joined by their family friends Christine Bishop from\nChicago and Tom McIntyre.\nManny speaks about his Holocaust experience in schools and synagogues. He\nvolunteered at the museum, leading museum tours for school and law enforcement\ngroups. Manny celebrates his 80th birthday on May 8th. He may say the significance\nabout that date a little bit later. With that, | would like to join you in welcoming our \"First\nPerson\" Mr. Manny Mandel.\n(applause)\n>> Bill Benson: Manny, thanks so much -- thanks so much for joining us and for being\nwilling to be our \"First Person\" today. | know you have got a busy week. You're speaking\nagain here at the museum tomorrow, | understand. You have so much to share with us\nand a limited time, so we'll get right to it.\nYou were born in Riga, Latvia, as | mentioned earlier, in 1936 but your family\nstayed there and certainly yours was a short one before you moved to Budapest. War\nbegan in Europe when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 when you were just\n3 years old.\nLet's start first with you telling us a little bit about your family, your parents, and\nyour life before the war, before the Holocaust began.\n>> Manny Mandel: You need to know that there is something unique about Hungary, not\nus, but Hungary and the Nazi government. You need to know if you don't know that only\ntwo countries in Europe, basically, were in a different situation than all the others.\nSpecifically Hungary was an Ally was Germany. As a consequence, the Jewish\ncommunity of Hungary had a different experience than the Jewish community of Poland, a\nvery significant difference in that we did not have any occupation by Germans. The\nGermans don't arrive in Hungary, in presence, in person, until 1944. And you know how\nlate in the war that is because the war ends in 1945.\nSo for the first years of the war, from 1938, '39 through the early '40s, our\ndifficulties come not so much from the Nazis but from the war itself. Bombings every time.\nOther kinds of things. And certain restrictions that the government, in fact, was able to\nmanipulate. We were under the rule of the Hungarian Nazi Party but that's different than\nbeing under the rule of the German Nazi party. So our experience is war related more so\nthan Holocaust related.\n>> Bill Benson: But in that short period beginning in March 1944, it was an extraordinarily\nhorrific time. And we'll turn to that.\nSo your family life and your family before the war, you told me a significant story\nthat your mother shared with you along the lines of someone saying one day, well, today\nyou now speak Yugoslavian. What was significant about that?\n>> Manny Mandel: That's before my time. That's really after the First World War. After\nthe First World War, Hungary is truncated and some of it becomes Yugoslavia, some of it\nbecomes Czechoslovakia. My mother was raised in the Hungarian part. She was a\nschool kid, maybe 10 years old or third grade. And that's when the war ended, First World\nWar, 1919 or so. And one day the teacher comes in and says, when you come back to\nschool next Monday, we're going to switch language. We have been teaching you in\nHungarian to Serbo-Croatian. It has as much in common as the moon and earth. But\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n4\nthey were bilingual. There was no problem in that situation. But Yugoslavia was created\nso let's use the Yugoslav language which was Serbo-Croatian. My mother's family,\nbrothers and sisters and parents, maintained Hungarian in the home. But in school, it\nwas, in fact, in Serbo-Croatian which | don't speak. | probably know six words. At one\ntime | may have known 20.\n>> Bill Benson: Manny, your father was an important cantor in Budapest. Tell us how he\ngot to that position.\n>> Manny Mandel: My father -- well, the shorter version is the fact that my father at some\npoint after serving in the Czech Army, he was drafted because this is not Czechoslovakia.\nHe was able to get to Vienna. My father was able to get in a cantor school which was\nworld renowned at the time in Vienna. When he graduated from that school, he wanted to\nhave a job in Hungary with his hopes being a cantor in Budapest. For those of you who\ndon't know, the cantor in the Jewish community is one who leads the services and there's\nlots of music involves and choirs involved and so forth.\nMy father wanted to, in fact, be in Budapest which is to him the New York\nYankees of The Metropolitan opera of the cantores. He was unable to get working papers\nin Budapest because he had been a Czech citizen having served in the Czech Army. Not\nby his own choice.\nSo he looked around Europe and he was able to find a very interesting and very\nimportant position in Riga. We have no Latvian connection or family. We know nobody in\nLatvia. At least | didn't. And they were then ready to come back to Budapest because he\ndid get an appointment in Budapest in 1936. They waited for me to arrive. As soon as |\narrived, within weeks, we moved to Budapest. | can tell you that my father -- some years\nago when my father was still alive, my wife and | went to Riga for a weekend visit to see it.\nIt's a nice place. My father said to me, look up \"post iela sesi.\" That's Post Street 6. That\nwas their address. That was the only Latvian he knew. We visited the building, and it was\nand enjoyable weekend.\n>> Bill Benson: His father in his journey to coming the cantor in Budapest, there were\nsome important decision points that he had earlier in his life. One of them was when he\nwas in the Army, the Army wanted him to sing for them.\n>> Manny Mandel: One of my favorite kind of warm, kind of fuzzy stories, my father\ndrafted into the Czech Army. Now, the Czech Army, as many Armies, don't have various\nmusical kind of things. It was some kind of anniversary of the Czech something. So they\nput on an opera. For those of you know anything about the Bohemian composer, Bedrich\nSmetana, he wrote the opera called Prodana Nevesta, The Bartered Bride. They wanted\nmy father to sing the lead. My father could not read music. He had never seen an opera.\nHe was able to be coached like a trained ape of sorts, and he did reasonably well.\nBased on that experience, the commanding musician of the whatever suggested\nthat they have a deal for him. The deal is, after his Army service, which they will cut a little\nshort if he is acceptable and if it's acceptable to him to send him to Prague to a\nconservatory to study music and to study voice to become an opera singer. My father\ndidn't Know what to do.\nHe couldn't approach his father with this kind of a question. He was reluctant.\nSo he called on his uncle, my grandmother's brother who was a lawyer. And he called the\nuncle who was kind of the conciliatory of the family to talk to his father. And the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n)\nuncle -- my great uncle goes to talk to his brother-in-law and they had a conversation.\nAnd comes back to my father and says, this is what your father said. You have to\nunderstand where they're living and what the background is, very religious family. | never\nknew my grandfather. He died years before | was born of smoking.\nBut in any case, he says, | have seven children. If my son Yehuda goes to sing\nin the opera and violates the Sabbath and things of that nature, | will have six children.\nThus ended my father's opera career.\nAnd the other -- those of you that know opera, he would have been a perfectly\ngood tenor.\n>> Bill Benson: One of the other decision points, as | recall, Manny, is that he had\nopportunities to be a cantor elsewhere including, | think, London, other places than\nHungary. Did he ever later express in light of what happened to the family, did he ever\nexpress regret about not having taken one of those positions?\n>> Manny Mandel: Yes and no. He did not express any kind of resentment upon not\ntaking a position because his goal in life was to be in Budapest. And the other side of the\ncoin is he said, had | taken the position in London, we would have escaped the Holocaust.\nInteresting where he was, in those days people went on various kinds of -- what they call\nprobers. They were auditions. One was in the duke's place synagogue in London which\nwas bombed during the war. If he would have taken that, perhaps other members of the\nfamily, would have been avoided during the Holocaust.\n>> Bill Benson: As you said to us earlier the full force of the Holocaust and war did not hit\nyour community in Hungary until the spring of 1944, there were still many difficulties for\nyou once the war was underway in Europe, beginning in fall 1939. Tell us about the\ncircumstances of your family and what you may recall yourself being as young as you\nwere from those first few years of the war, before it really came to Hungary.\n>> Manny Mandel: Because | was as young as | was and because of the circumstances in\nwhich we lived, | described the fact that | lived very much in a bubble. | was well-protected\nfrom much of this. | Knew about many things. | recall them. | can describe them. | did\nnot get the impact of the effect that | would have, had | been five or eight years older. If |\nhad been five or eight years older, chances are | wouldn't be.\nBut | was very well-protected but | saw things. | was very surprised and kind of\nupset in a way that when we saw the Hungarian soldiers on the street and knew they were\nAllies with the Germans my parents were upset with that. | could understand that. |\nunderstand this is a 5 and 6-year-old talking. | don't know why you root for a hometown. |\ndon't know if you folks are from Washington. But the football team from your home\ncommunity is the one you root for. In Washington we don't root for Dallas. We root for\nWashington.\n(laughter).\n| didn't understand why my parents were rooting not for the local team but for the\nAllies. That's difficult for a kid to understand after knowing local heros.\nOther things began to happen. The Hungarian Numerus Clausus which were\nthe restricted laws were passed in the '20s, not the \u201830s. You may know that the \u201830s the\nGerman Nuremberg laws came out. But Hungarian laws were passed in the '20s after\nFirst World War but not really enforced until much later, maybe 10, 12 years later in the\nlate '30s.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n6\nSO aS a consequence of that, from 1940 or so, my father was conscripted into\nthe labor battalions. Hungarian men were drafted into the Army and fought in Russia.\nHungarian Jews were not drafted into the Army but into labor battalions to backfill those\npositions that Hungarian men had, which had to do with some farming and some mining\nand railroad repair and road repair. And my father was perhaps like a traveling salesman.\nAfter a while it was normal for him not to be home.\nBut from '42 to '44, | saw him infrequently. | did see him but infrequently. We\nwould get a call or a visit or a letter that said on Tuesday at 3:00, he will be at such and\nsuch a railroad station to be gone for a day, a week, or an indeterminant period of time.\nHe would be out for a week, home for a week, out for a day. Always in Hungary. It's not\nreally that big. Anywhere a couple of hours by train. So | had very limited contact with\nhim at that time.\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us what the Arrow Cross was.\n>> Manny Mandel: The Arrow Cross is the symbol, crossed arrows, is a symbol as\nopposed to the swastika, is the symbol of the Hungarian political party. In Germane it was\na political party that had heavy impact on the Army and the government. In Hungary, it\nwasn't such an Army. It had less impact. It was a ruling philosophy of an anti-Semitic\nnature.\n>> Bill Benson: And the anti-Semitism began to increase and more and more restrictions\nwere imposed on Jews, what were some of the restrictions you recall?\n>> Manny Mandel: The restrictions on a kid were very limited. Let me say it in two parts.\nPart one would be the air raid that happened once, twice, three times a night, were a\nmajor impact. Even | could understand the next morning when | go to school, the building\nnext door to me may be gone. There was significant damage in Budapest. It was bombed\nearly by the Russians and later by the Allies coming from two directions.\nBut most of the other things did not have impact on me specifically, for example,\nthe restrictions in jobs, restrictions in some travel, restrictions in which you could and\ncouldn't shop, but | didn't do the shopping so | would not have been bothered by that in\nany direct sense.\n>> Bill Benson: You told me, | thought, a very poignant story in that as a kid, like any kid,\nyou wanted a bicycle but your father wouldn't let you have one.\n>> Manny Mandel: Well, | had a trike, like an overgrown tricycle. My father said there\nwere two reasons he blocked the possibility. One | will handle, one | will not. What | can\nhandle is what | said, | lived in an apartment building on the fifth floor which was 50 years\nold. It had an elevator which was also 50 years old. And on many occasions, that\nelevator had parts that would break down and the parts that were to replace them were\nmanufactured in factories that would do ammunition and guns and stuff. And elevator\nparts for my building were kind of low on the priority list. So it was out of service perhaps\nas much as it was in service.\nWhen we had to go to air raid shelters every night, five stories down, five stories\nup. | could not carry a bike five stories down because in Europe you ride in the park, not\nin the backyard which you don't have. He was a strong gentleman in his 30s so he would\ntruck the bike down and back up.\nBut there was a second problem. All of us, one of the restrictions was we wore\na Yellow Star to be identified. | thought the star was a major mark of heroism because\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nif\nafter all, | was 6 years old or 7 and | wore a star just like the adults did. | then discovered\nthat it was true this bicycle experience | began to discover that this was not so much a\nmark of heroism but a target that could be attacked in some way.\nMy father said to me, if we go to the park and you ride the bike with the Yellow\nStar and you are out of my sight, someone might have the notion -- because it happened\nin other place -- to whack you on the head. Not to steal the bike, they don't want the bike,\njust because you are a target and it's open season on these kinds of things. And for that\nreason, you don't have a bike. | was very upset by that.\nBut you have to understand that this heroism notion of the Yellow Star to identify\nme as a Jew was not a mark of heroism but a mark of targeting for possible mayhem.\nThat was a particular experience that began me to teach what was going on. | can add\nwhen we came to this country in 1949, | was 13 years old. And one of the very first things\nmy parents did when | came home from school one day, they said we are going to the\ndepartment store, something we don't have anymore. What are we going to buy? A\nbicycle. So | had -- and | treasured that bicycle. | think it lived with my in my bedroom, |\npolished it four times a year. It was a Schwinn for those of you old enough to remember\nSchwinn bicycles.\n>> Bill Benson: Do you remember going to school? What was school like?\n>> Manny Mandel: | went to a parochial school, a Jewish day school which happened to\nbe three or four blocks from my house.\nMy apartment was on the corner of two streets, this one and this one. And my\nparent's bedroom was on the corner. From the bedroom, you could see the school.\nMaybe four blocks away, three blocks away. Yet, I'm told on many occasions, perhaps\nevery day, somebody would follow me to school because that Yellow Star in first grade\nwas an absolute invitation to be whacked on the head. Again, they are not going to rob\nme of my money or my wallet or my driver's license. But they were going to whack me on\nthe head because it was open season on that kind of mayhem. And it did happen, not to\nme but it did happen.\n>> Bill Benson: In December 1941, your family had a truly horrifying experience while you\nwere visiting your aunt in another city. Tell us about that.\n>> Manny Mandel: That was my very first experience beginning to understand particularly\nin recollection what this was all about. I'm 5 1/2 years old in the winter of '41. As | said to\nyou, my mother grew up in northern Yugoslavia which was southern Hungary. And my\ngrandparents and aunts lived there. My mother had two sisters and three brothers but\nthey were no longer living there.\nIn any case, we go down to a city called Novi Sad, in those days many cities had\nmultiple names because it depends on which country they belonged in in a certain time.\nNovi Sad is a Serbian name.\nWe go there by train. It's about 3, 3 1/2 hours south of Budapest by train. We\nstay at my aunt's house. My mother's younger sister. It's very nice. | don't remember\nexactly what we did. But! do recall that my aunt's husband had a cook factory. | was\ntaken to the factory to be given a tour. | was interested to see what kind of products they\nmake out of cork. I'm not sure it's significant. My uncle died and the factory went.\nOne morning, perhaps three days after we were there, somebody comes up the\nstairs and says there's something going on in the street. Policeman come up and say\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n8\nknock, knock, ladies and gentlemen, you need to dress warmly because you have to be\noutside. We have to do acensus. Now, it's winter. It's not bitter but it's winter and it's\ncold. The Germans or the Hungarians, but the ruling government, was going to count\nJews every 20 minutes, | think. Now a census in this country they did every ten years.\nThere they did with great frequency, on the assumption, perhaps a correct one, if you\ncount people and know where they are, you can control their movement and what they do\nand where they are.\nSO we were to come outside, my mother, my father, my aunt and we were on\nthe street on the sidewalk. We were told to turn left and start walk can in that direction.\nWe had no idea why. We walked for some time, a couple, three hours maybe. | know my\nmother carried me, my father carried me and | also walked. | was 5 1/2 years old. | was a\nlittle guy.\nWe walked to a place | recognized. On our left -- on our right was the major\nstreet, and on the left was an 8-foot stocking fence. Now, for those of you who may have\nbeen in Europe and you may know this, European cities which are not on the ocean or a\nbig lake use rivers to make beaches out of them in the summertime. This city is on the\nDanube River, south of Budapest. It flows from Germany into the Black Sea through\nBudapest and Yugoslavia.\n| remember the place because that summer, perhaps two months or three\nmonths before, | had been there. And inside the fence, about 300 yards away from the\nfence, are hot pools and cold pools and wave pools and restaurants and amusement\nparks. A very nice place in the summertime. This is December. The place is shut down\nbecause this is -- you know, this is not beach weather.\nAs we are all marching, kind of walking slowly, my grandparents had arrived.\nSomebody brought them by truck. And we were huddled together perhaps a dozen\npeople or so and we were walking slowly in this direction. Again, in the direction -- and we\nnotice the gates to this place turn in towards the river. We still have no idea what's going\non.\nThere's some noise which was very identifiable, we didn't know it. As we get\nsomewhat closer -- | don't know how far we were at this point, 50 feet, 100 yards. A\npoliceman is standing on the right and he says to my father, mister, what are you doing\nhere? He says I'm here with my family. He said, that's not the point.\nThe point is that | know that you don't live here. You live in Budapest and | know\nthat because |'m a foot patrolman in your district. And | have seen you on the street any\nnumber of times so | know that you live there. So being here and being counted in this\ncrowd would mess up the numbers. Can't do that. Step aside.\nMy father and my mother and our little group steps aside. I'm sure it was a\nmatter of absolute coincidence. As we are stepping aside, a minute or two later, literally a\nminute to two, the staff comes down the road, a uniformed soldier comes out, has a\npow-wow with his patrolmen and says the requirement of the census has been met.\nThere is a school over there and you are welcome to get hot chocolate or coffee and go\nhome. If you are bewildered, can you imagine how bewildered we were. We go home to\nmy aunt's house. No idea what happened. The phone calls start to come in. We had\nphones. My aunt calls and she says where were you, we had plans. We tell her.\nThe policeman comes to the door and said | would do a census. | would do\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n9\nwhat | would normally do. My aunt invited them in and gave them coffee and cake. 17\ncakes, 19 coffees, and they had the best breakfast coffee in their life. They asked three\nquestions and they left. And my aunt said, what's going on? | didn't go to the beach. |\ndidn't go to the stockade fence. The experience of those people if | had made that left turn\nwas a much more horrible one.\nThe government, in fact, took canon with which they cracked the ice in the\nDanube which was yay thick. All those who, in fact, made a left turn were shot into the\nriver, never to be found again or if they were found, they were found floating underneath\nthe ice in Belgrade about an hour away the next March or whenever the river thawed out.\nThis is a Pogrom, a senseless, useless, valueless experience that people can do because\nthey can do it and you can't stop them.\nsomething that happened -- this was retribution for that. And 350 people were\nkilled in the Pogrom of Novi Sad of 1941. | didn't quite understand what that meant but |\ncan describe the story | just did.\nThe next morning, | only tell you about because this is something | do remember\nand meaning to me. My father calls for a taxi to go back to Budapest. Somehow, folks,\nwhen there is a catastrophe around you, what you want to do is go home. My\ngrandparents with my aunts, | was perfectly safe but this was not home. Home was in\nBudapest.\nMy father calls for a taxi and a one horse-power taxi shows up. Can you guess\nwhat that would be? My daughter. She is cheating. A one horse-power taxi is a sleigh.\nThere's snow on the ground. The regular taxis had engines in them as well. But this is\nwhat showed up and that's what | remember because, again, for 5 1/2-year-old that's an\nadventure. 350 people killed doesn't have that much meaning but a sleigh -- a\nhorse-drawn sleigh to go to the train station is an adventure.\n>> Bill Benson: Manny, I'm going to have us jump now more than two years to March 1944\nwhen Germany occupied Hungary and, of course, things changed profoundly,\ndramatically, and almost instantly. Tell us what brought the Germans in at that stage\nbecause they hadn't occupied Hungary up until that point and then what happened from\nthere.\n>> Manny Mandel: In 1942 in Berlin, in a place called Wannsee, there was a conference\ncalled by the chief SS officer, a general in the Eastern Front of the German war. He called\nfor a conference where they came up with the particulars for the final solution to the\nJewish problem. It's a phrase that you should know. Obviously the final solution was\nextermination.\nThey appointed a man to be the person who, in fact, run this is project, this\nissue. His name was Adolf Eichmann. Some of you may know the name. I'll get to some\nstories about him a little bit later. But Eichmann, in fact, did a very effective job. Heis a\nmidlevel officer in the Army, lieutenant colonel. And he, in fact, cleared the Jews from all\nof the countries of Europe and sends him to various extermination and concentration\ncamps. You know some of the names of Auschwitz, Birkenau and so forth.\nSince Hungary is an Ally of Germany, he does not come to Hungary. He comes\nto Hungary -- well, doesn't come then. He comes to Hungary last. Now, '44, March of\n'44 is very, very late in the war. You remember the D Day is June of '44. The war is over\nin May of '45. So this is if you want to talk in terms of, again, football context, this is fourth\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n10\nquarter.\nHe comes to Budapest on the 19th of March, 1944. And the significance there\nincidentally is the fact that today | asked the people in the museum why they asked me to\ndo \"First Person\" today. They said because the 17th of March today is not reminiscent to\nSaint Patty's Day, it's reminiscent that the Germans came to Budapest where | was on the\n17th.\nBut in any case on the 19th of March, Eichmann arrives. As soon as he\narrives -- | mean, aS soon as some issues happen, the deportation from Budapest begin at\nthe rate of 12,000 a day. Now, | don't know where you folks are from, but also when |\nspeak to groups | find people from smaller communities where 12,000 represents the\nwhole city or the whole town or represents their school. And that was the size of the\ndeportation beginning immediately within days of the 19th of March, 1944.\n>> Bill Benson: What happened to your family when Eichmann arrived? Actually, what\nprompted them to come into Hungary at that point?\n>> Manny Mandel: It was the last one that had not been cleared.\n>> Bill Benson: But there had been some political change in Hungary, right?\n>> Manny Mandel: That was perhaps the least significant of the reason. They were\ncoming as a consequence -- and in relation to that, the Ally connection with Germany\nceased and the Horthy, the region of Hungary, was no longer in charge and the charge\ncame from the Hungarian fascist government, the Arrow Cross.\nBut what happened to us is that almost as soon as Eichmann arrives two men\nfrom kind of a subgenerated rescue committee, as they call themselves, insist on\napproaching Eichmann. Ladies and gentlemen, you need to understand you don't just go\nup to the Majestic Hotel and say | want to speak to Adolf Eichmann. I'm not trying to\ncompare the two. If | was in Rome and | want to see the Pope, | couldn't quite walk up to\nthe Vatican and say \"I want to see the Pope.\" These people insisted and thank God they\ndid.\nThe leader of this twosome was a Hungarian Jewish attorney from the\nRomanian part of Hungary, the City of Kluche called Kunszentniklos. Again, multiple\nnames. Who began to discussion with Eichmann a proposition that is about as ridiculous\nas it could be, this was it.\nIf Eichmann will release a million Jews, a million Jews from the various camps,\nthey will supply him with 10,000 trucks with certain material, tea, coffee and other kinds of\nthings for the German war. Now, the problem was many fold besides the fact that it\ncouldn't happen. But the point was that Eichmann didn't have million people to release.\nThere were no million people anymore. Most had been killed.\nSecondly, these guys had about as much opportunity to have 10,000 trucks.\nThey did have a bicycle pump or a hubcap, not 10,000 trucks.\n>> Bill Benson: It was a completely audacious proposal.\n>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely absurd. And they knew it. One of the two, in fact, is\nsent -- he sent through Turkey to go to Egypt to talk to the British High Command to\ndiscuss trucks. He's arrested in Syria. Spends the rest of his war in jail in Cairo as a spy,\nsurvives the war but nothing happens.\nThe point of this absurdity at least was the beginning of a possibility. The\nnegotiations continued and continued. And do understand that these negotiations did not\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n11\nbegin with Eichmann. They were all the way up to Goering, Heydrich, Himmler. He was\nnumber three in the German government. There was a man name by Himmler, the head\nof SS. He was directly involved. But the whole thing had to do with the fact that Nazi\ngovernment leadership kind of smelled the fact that the issues of the war were not going in\ntheir favor. This was around D Day already. The only last instance was the Battle of the\nBulge. The point was they kind of smelled the end. They were looking to find a way in\nsome way do something for their life after the war.\nAs a side bar, | will tell you that Eichmann, in fact, is not arrested. He is arrested\nbut he also escapes. And he winds up -- anybody know where he winds up? Eichmann\u2019?\nHe was captured by the Israel Secret Service many years later in Argentina. He didn't\nnecessarily go to Argentina with our valuables that were collected because the trucks\ncould not be made available. Money was collected, significant money from all over the\nworld for a group of 1700 people to be taken in the 35-car train from Budapest. | will tell\nyou about that in one minute after | finish Eichmann.\nEichmann and his henchmen and the others used the valuable to establish lives\nfor themselves. You might know Dr. Mengele who did all the experimentation in\nAuschwitz. He also ends in Argentina. He was captured and taken to Israel and tried and\nhanged. That's the point, that's how these people found their ways and many others\nwhom they never found after the war with the kind of stuff they would collect from these\n1700 people.\nThe selection of these 1700 people was a very complex issue. Everybody in\nHungary certainly whoever had any interest in that land over there called then-Palestine\nwhich became Israel held various kinds of certificates for contributions made to the Jewish\nNational Fund. This is an organization which bought lands and which settlements could\nbe started in the early 1900s and through the '20s and '30s. For reasons | cannot explain,\nthe German government accepted these certificates as proof of our being displaced\npersons during the war. And they served as exit visas for this 1700 group.\nFolks, if you have ever seen a three-dollar bill, this is one of them, a three-dollar\nbill. We were to be taken to a neutral point and dispatched from Europe because Hitler's\nposition was to get Jews out of Germany, out of Europe, and then out of the world. He\ndidn't get to the third part.\nWe were placed in this trailer of 35 cars. 1700 people, maybe 50 or 60 people\nto a car depending and transported north. The leadership of this group did not know\nwhere we were going and which port we were going to.\nAs it happens, we found ourselves not far from Hannover in a concentration\ncamp, nota killing camp but concentration camp called Bergen-Belsen. We were told this\nwould be a three-day R&R, rest and recuperation, stopped before we boarded the ships.\nAfter six weeks of R&R, about 350 people were taken by the Germans as part of the\nnegotiations and taken to Switzerland. Guess what, | wasn't one of them. | stayed a full\n5 1/2 months.\n>> Bill Benson: Your father was not with you.\n>> Manny Mandel: No, | will talk about that in a second.\nMy mother, my father -- my uncle and I, my father's younger brother and | were,\nin fact, taken out of Germany by German troops, Rickety old troop trains and taken to\nSwitzerland. My war was over at this time. This is December 1944. The war ends on\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n12\nMay 8th, 1945. | will comment about that later.\nMy father is in labor camp as he had been from '42 on. He could not -- because\nhe didn't have the choice of joining us. Had he been able to join us, we would have found\nspace for him. He does survive the war. We meet later in 1946. So from '42 to '44, | see\nhim intermittently. From '44 to '46, | don't see him at all. After those years we had to\nreestablish a relationship because there's a difference with being 8 and being 12, or 7 and\n11 or whatever. So we did meet up.\n>> Bill Benson: What were your conditions like because you were part of a select group, if\nyou will, in Bergen-Belsen?\n>> Manny Mandel: Because we are part of a celeb group, we were the golden eggs laid by\nthe goose. We were the hostages. If they killed us, they would have nothing to negotiate\nwith. | mean, they would not have gotten the monies which were given in suitcases. The\nvaluables here were things you could carry in a suitcase.\nMoney was not an issue because the only valuable money that existed in\nEurope then were the American dollars and the British pound sterling which nobody had.\nBut jewelry of every kind and gold and silver, rubies, whatever else had intrinsic value\nwere the barter, negotiation funds that were used.\nIf they had begun to kill us or killed us totally, which they could have done, they\nwould not have been able to get this. And that would have been a disaster for them.\nAs a consequence, although we had all the amenities that Bergen-Belsen\nprovided, we did not go to work. Now, an 8-year-old wouldn't have gone to work anyhow.\nBut we were in these barracks, in these compounds. These were the Hungarian\ncompound where we were all by ourselves. So there was the advantage of having a\nslightly easier life but the difficulties of the kind of weather in Germany, the kind of daily\ncensus we had to do, three, four hours in the mud. The kind of no food or lack of food\nwhich was typical for Bergen-Belsen. So the conditions -- the sanitation situation was\nhorrible.\nWe had showers periodically, hot showers. And we didn't know the hot showers\nwere in our case hot water. In the case of Auschwitz was gas. But what I'm saying is the\nconditions in Bergen-Belsen were horrible but terrible in the sense that we survived.\n>> Bill Benson: | was struck when we first met and you told me about that, about that part\nof your experience, that there were these attempts to really try to create a sense of\nnormalcy in Bergen-Belsen in the Hungarian compound. Say a bit about that.\n>> Manny Mandel: Folks, the will to survive is a very powerful one. When we got to\nBergen-Belsen, we had been told to pack some food and whatever for the journey to the\nboots, which we never got to.\nOne of the things that some of us knew about, maybe all of us knew about -- |\ndon't mean | but the adults, but when you take tin cans and you use them, you can boil\nthem and clean them and put fresh food in them and take them to a factory that we knew\nabout that could reseal them so they would be somewhat protected from botulism and\nthings like that. My mother had some of these with her. And so did others.\nAfter we used the food, the supplemental food and very carefully rationed,\npeople decided what they should do with these tin cans is not recycle them in the way we\nrecycle but to cut them up and make jewelry out of it.\nYou take a tin can and you make earrings or bracelets or necklaces because\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n13\nyou have the skill to do it. Now how you had tools to do it | will never know. But, for\nexample, the cobbler had shoe-making repair tools. You could trade a pair of earrings for\nshoes which you could then trade for two cigarettes for something else. This kind of\nbusiness and commerce began under the conditions of Bergen-Belsen strictly as a sign of\nsurvival. People needed shoes repaired if they possibly could or a haircut or half a dozen\nother kinds of things that you could do. These were all attempts by the people there to in\nsome way establish kind of a daily life for them that would be reminiscent of the time\nbefore this situation took place.\n>> Bill Benson: You got very ill while you were there, as | recall.\n>> Manny Mandel: Everybody has two sets of lungs. But! had triple pneumonia. | don't\nknow how you do that. The problem with pneumonia, which had to do with sanitation and\nbeing outside and bugs and so forth, the problem was there's no treatment available for it.\nToday pneumonia is cured very quickly. First of all, you have pneumonia-preventing\nvaccine shot. | just got my second shot two days ago because my doctor said | should.\nBut the point there were no treatments then because the antibiotics which were just being\ninvented, Fleming came up with Penicillin in the early '40s. And | guarantee you the first\nplace it was tested was not in the concentration camps.\nSo there was nothing they could do. We had 35 physicians in the group.\nThere's nothing they could do except diagnose, yes, you have pneumonia. When you\ncough, it's going to be painful. All they could do is do some Palliative medicine. It doesn't\ndo a thing but it makes you feel better. They used mustard plasters. Anybody hear of it?\nMy family can't talk.\n(laughter).\nWell, you get some kind of heavy material -- | Know where they found it -- and\nyou get some mustard seed and you soak it in water and you soak this cloth in mustard\nand you put it -- they put it on my like a dressing. Now, it functions as Bengay or Vick's. It\nheats the body. It doesn't cure the pneumonia. But while you have the pneumonia, it\nmakes you feel better. That's why it's call palliative medicine. They did that to me about\nsix weeks. Obviously | survived because the body cured itself and | was healthy from that\npoint on. But for six weeks, | was flat on my back.\n>> Bill Benson: As you told us earlier in December of 1944, for you, the war was\neffectively over when you made it to Switzerland to a neutral country. And as you also\nsaid, your father was not with you.\nTell us where -- he was in the labor camps. But when he got out of the labor\ncamps, what did he do when he returned to Budapest? And did he know anything about\nabout you?\n>> Manny Mandel: Not when he returned. He returned to Budapest before Budapest's\nliberation, quote-unquote, by the Russians which was a peculiar kind of liberation. It\neliminated the Nazis but created other problems.\nMy father's youngest brother was with us in camp. He was instrumental get can\nus into the group. His named was David. And my wife and | decided if we have a son, his\nname would be David. And David is sitting right over there.\nMy father was -- by the time that we left Hungary, he was no longer in territorial\nHungary, he and his group went into Ukraine for similar work. In '44 as the war was\nmoving in reverse for the Nazis, the guards and the other kinds of restrictions were kind\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n14\nof -- not lifted but they disappeared.\nMy father and about 20 other men in his particular platoon, brigade, command,\nwhatever it is, decided to walk away. They walked from the Ukraine back to Budapest.\nThey walked at night. They slept during the day. They stole food wherever they\ncould. They cooked the food in exhaust of trucks. They did what they could to survive.\nMy father is back in Hungary and the Nazis were still there. He had some affiliation with a\nnoteworthy man, Raul Wallenberg who issued Swiss exit visas. He issued these Visas\nwhich were about as valuable as a three-dollar bill. But the Germans accepted them. And\nthey used three-dollar bill again for the same reason. And those that could find the way to\nget out of Hungary were able to survive because of Wallenberg's involvement. For those\nof you who came to the museum this morning, if you didn't come on the 14th street side\nbut on the 15th street side where the plaza is, that's called Raul Wallenberg place in honor\nhim to have a two-block area. Fifteenth street was renamed Raul Wallenberg in honor of\nhim who was very instrumental.\nMy father was in peripheral contact with him. He lived -- he found our\napartment. And he was able to locate the man who was involved in negotiations. This\nHungarian Jewish lawyer by the name of Kasztner. He was able to after some difficulties\nto get Kasztner to tell him that we were, in fact, are in Bergen-Belsen. Because the group\nof special nature was traceable through the Red Cross. They knew where we were.\nCouldn't contact us when we left Bergen-Belsen. And they talked about the fact we went\nfrom Switzerland were placed in a children's home, like a boarding school. You saw a\npicture of it. You had to be somewhere.\nMy mother was a teacher there. She was assigned to that place because there\nhad to be somebody there who spoke Hungarian to us and could speak German or French\nto the rest of the administration. My mother had very good German from school and she\nhad passable French. The leadership of the school of the Heiden School was a German\nJew by the name of Miller whom we later met in Philadelphia. But the point is she was\nthere, she was able to take some trips -- she was paid a salary. She looked up a\ncolleague of my father's, a cantor, with whom my father studied in Vienna.\nAs a Swiss citizen, he could make contact. My mother corresponded with him\nand corresponded to Noi and Noi talked to my mother. That was the contact that\nestablished we were alive. We couldn't go to where we were and he couldn't come to\nwhere we were. He did say when the opportunity came up, we should come back to\nHungary which my mother refused. She said she will never set foot in Hungary ever again\nand she didn't.\nShe decided this is the original notion of the trip was to go to Palestine on these\nboats. That's what she would do. She had no idea what Palestine but that's what she\nwould do. We went to Palestine in September 1945 on a British troop ship. We were\nliving there. My father joined us there in 1946.\n>> Bill Benson: The war ended on a significant date.\n>> Manny Mandel: You want my comments on that?\n>> Bill Benson: Yes, | do.\n>> Manny Mandel: Maybe there's three very important reasons for existing. The war\nended. It is the birthday of the President of the United States in that year. You recall who\nthat was? It was not Roosevelt. Roosevelt died in April and the President after\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n15\n15 minutes becomes Harry Truman. | don't remember the year he was born. But we have\nthe war ending on May 8th, Harry Truman's birthday and, of course, my birthday is on\nMay 8th. The three important reasons for celebration of the war, Harry and I.\n(laughter).\n>> Bill Benson: So your family got reunited in Palatine, in Israel. What did your family do\nto try to resume life?\n>> Manny Mandel: My mother got a job being kind of a caretaker for a child. My father got\na job at a cantor. And my father had a particular thought in life. My father, as | said to you\nbefore, came from a family of seven. Two of the women died before | was born of various\ndiseases in 1930 or '31.\nThe third sister came to the United States in 1914. My grandfather who was not\nvery successful decided that if my Aunt Helen, the oldest of his children, were to come to\nPhiladelphia to live with a cousin that would reduce his burden at home. And she did.\nShe came to Philadelphia, married in Philadelphia, had three children. Lived to be\n90-some years old and had a very nice life.\nBut my father's one brother, his youngest brother David, was with us. Two other\nbrothers died during the war. So my father decided that what he would like to do in 1947\nis come to the States to visit his sister who he hadn't seen since 1914. It was such a long\ntime but my eldest aunt never met my younger uncle. He was born after she left.\nMy father came to Philadelphia, visits with my aunt and was able to make some\narrangements which gave -- which was an idea that was suggested to him that maybe\nwhat he ought to do is stay here and bring us over, which eventually after certain kinds of\nnegotiations he was able to do.\n>> Bill Benson: How old were you when you arrived?\n>> Manny Mandel: 1913 -- 1913. (laughter).\n| was 13.\n>> Bill Benson: My last question of you before we have time for a few questions from our\naudience, 13 years old, all that you had been through in Hungary and then Switzerland\nand then to Palestine.\n>> Manny Mandel: Which becomes Israel.\n>> Bill Benson: While you are there.\n>> Manny Mandel: | went from war to war.\n>> Bill Benson: And now you arrive in the United States. What was that like for you as a\n13-year-old boy?\n>> Manny Mandel: Well, besides it being fascinating and bewildering, it was also one\nmore adjustment | had to make. And I'll tell you about one part of that adjustment.\n| mean, the subway in New York which is where we lived for the first year was\nunusual. Budapest has the second-oldest subway in the world. Skyscrapers, Venetian\nblinds, they used to be Chiclet machine in the subway stations for a nickel, that was very\ninteresting.\nThe one thing that was a major adjustment was that my English was literally\nnon-existent. English was taught from the fifth grade on in Israel, in Palestine until one\nday the teacher comes in, if you know something about the history, you know that the\nBritish were not our friends. The teacher comes in who was trained in England and says,\nokay, as of tomorrow, we are no longer going to study English. Terrific. We're going to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n16\nstudy American.\n(laughter).\nSo my English and my American was not particularly strong. Left alot to be\ndesired.\nNow, to arrive some place and not know the language is difficult. And | can\nillustrate by it by something. But there were bright people around. My parents were\nlooking for a school. They thought of a parochial school. That didn't work out because\nthey decided because of my English | should be in third grade. Now, it's not the question\nof what grade you're in but a third grader and seventh grader and have little in common in\nmany ways. If you know anything about the development of people, the age of third grade\nand the age of seventh is quite different.\nWe then discovered that the apartment we had sublet for the summer was a\nblock away from PS number 3 in New York. For you New Yorkers, it's in the village. It's\noff Hudson Street which is the end of 8th Avenue around Saint Christopher's. We walked\nto the school. My parent's English was not much better. My father had the best having\nbeen here for a year. We talked to the principal about what we're going to do.\nWe came up with a brilliant recommendation but it was an adjustment. He said,\nokay, the kid's in seventh grade. We will put him in the seventh grade. We have 7A and\n7B. If he was able to pick up enough language in 7B, we'll put him in eighth grade. If not,\nwe'll Keep him in 7th grade which makes good sense. However, since we are teaching\nSpanish in 7th grade, we will excuse him from Spanish and give him an extra study hall so\nwe can learn some more English. That was another adjustment | had to make.\n>> Bill Benson: And adjust you did. And here we are today in 2016.\n>> Manny Mandel: And | learned some English. (laughter).\n>> Bill Benson: Very effectively.\nWe have time for just one or two questions from our audience. If you have a\nquestion, we will have a microphone handed to you so wait until you have a mic. You will\nmake your question as short as you can, and I'll repeat it just to be sure that all of us,\nincluding Manny and the audience, hears the question. So | think we can do one or two\nquestions.\nAnybody have a question they would like to ask?\n>> Manny Mandel: Not all at once. (laughter).\n>> Bill Benson: We got one, | think -- there's a hand right there. There we go. Thank you.\n>> Do | need to stand up?\n>> Bill Benson: No, you're fine.\n>> Thank you. | was just trying to see you. (laughter).\nSir, | don't Know if you know anything about the rhetoric that was going on in\nEurope and Hungary and that kind of thing in the 1930s or whatever or if you studied\nthose. Is there any similarities in the rhetoric against the Jews that went on then as to\nsome of the rhetoric that seems to be happening in the United States today?\n>> Manny Mandel: | heard.\n>> Bill Benson: You heard the question. To the extent that you feel comfortable\nanswering that.\n>> Manny Mandel: It's very difficult. First of all, I'm not an expert in it.\n| would say this, unfortunately rhetoric sounds similar. But the goals of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n17\nrhetoric are quite different. No place in the history of the world that | know of and anybody\nin this room -- | would be willing to be challenged -- can talk about the fact that rhetoric\nwas designed for extermination. Now, there's an enormous difference between the goal\nbeing extermination and the goal being all kinds of other acts, good, bad and otherwise.\nWhat I'm saying is the words may sound alike but the goal of the words was unique to that\nperiod of time. And today's words don't have that as a goal. | hope | have responded as\nwell as | could.\n>> Bill Benson: Thank you.\n| think we may have one more question. The lights are so bright hard to see out\nIn the back.\nNo hands, | think we're good to go. We're going to conclude the program in just\na moment. | want to first thank all of you for being here. Remind you that we will do \"First\nPerson\" programs twice a week, Wednesdays and Thursdays, through the middle of\nAugust. We will soon begin live streaming a number of the programs, | think, beginning in\nApril. So you will be able to pick them up through the Internet and we think that's a very\nexciting development. Programs will be heard anywhere for that matter. So join us one\nway or the other. Come back here or listen over the Internet if you can.\nIt's our tradition at \"First Person\" that our \"First Person\" gets the last word. So\nI'm going to turn back to Manny to close our program. When he finishes, Manny will stay\nup on the stage here. Our photographer Joel is going to come up on the stage and take a\nphotograph and we'll ask you to rise because he's going to take a picture with you as the\nbackground to the photograph. Because we didn't have time for more questions,\nabsolutely feel free when we finish to come up on stage and talk with Manny, ask him\nanother question or just shake his hand if you want to do that. So we welcome you to\ncome up here and do that when we close the program.\nManny?\n>> Manny Mandel: In my presentation to you folks and answers to those questions, | said\nthings like this many times. | said | don't know if you know, you should know, you should\nremember. Working here at the museum for a good number of years now, | find that the\nknowledge of history is abominable. It's a big ward but that's what it is. What | would like\nto call your attention the words of a philosopher, historian about a hundred years ago.\nRemember his words, those who do not learn their history well may be deemed or\ndoomed to repeat it or parts of it. And if any of you remember who that was, | will remind\nyou. It was a member of George Santayana who was teaching in California at the time of\nItalian extraction.\n| leave you with the words that say, folks, since we cannot learn from the future but we can\nlearn from the past, learn the past, learn history, all kinds of history, Holocaust,\nUnited States, or anything else because it's the only thing we can learn from to impact the\nfuture. | leave you with that thought.\n>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Manny.\n(applause)\n",
