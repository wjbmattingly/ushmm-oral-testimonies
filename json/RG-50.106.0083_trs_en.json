            "question": "Tell me a little bit about your parents, how \u0152 and also how far back the family goes in Vienna.",
            "answer": "Okay. Both my parents came from rather prosperous, middle class, I guess you would call it. Both grandfathers were prominent businessmen in Austria. Grandfather Ludwig Politzer was born somewhere in the far reaches of the Hapsburg empire in what is now Hungary , I guess, and came to Vienna as a very young man, to learn the language and to ab sorb a little culture. That was the thing to do for young people with any kind of ambition, to come to the capital at the time. It was, of course, the cultural center, right after Paris and Rome and London. He had a very interesting gold and silver \u0152 he was a gold and silversmith in a ta \u0152 in a stre \u0152 on a street that was called Papagenogasse, which is rather \u0152 rather very Viennese, you know, Papa Geno is one of the characters in \ufb01The Magic Flute .\ufb02 And a very interesting thing about Grandpa Politzer, we never really knew what kind of an artist he was, and in \u0152 in eight \u0152 in 1981, when the Metropolitan Museum had a beautiful exp \u0152 exhibit of Hapsburg treasures and \u0152 and costumes, we suddenly stood in front of a big, big [indecipherable] I call it, exhibit of jewelry that Hungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by Ludwig Politzer in circa \u0152 it said Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 5circa 1872. So my sister and I just \u0152 just \u0152 just couldn\u2122t believe it. I mean, this was just an unbelievable thing. We traced it down and it is now the property of the Imperial Museum in Budapest. And to try to get hold of somebody who knew something about it was \u0152 this was 1981, I said, was impossible. So I\u2122m still trying to figure out how I could see it one more time. But this was a \u0152 a beautiful thing. Also, he has a \u0152 a very interesting piece exhibited in one of the museums in Vienna. So unbeknownst to us when we lived in Vienna, he was apparently quite \u0152 quite an artist. The business was later on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of my father\u2122s, but I don\u2122t really know what happened. It doesn\u2122t exist any more. The other grandfather also came from somewhere in Hungary , as a very young man, about 15 years old, to learn something besi des Hungarian. And he turned out to be a very well-known businessman. He had the mo st \u0152 best known haberdashery, I guess you would call it, on what would be the Fifth Avenue of Vienna, called K\u00e4rntner Strasse. And once or twice a year he went to London and Paris for buying materials and \u0152 and \u0152 and fo r made-to-order suits for men and women. It was called the English fleet, the Englisch-Flotte, it was very well known, and it was, until about 10 years ago, carried on by a much younger child of hi \u0152 much younger than my mother\u2122s child, but that\u2122s a long family story that I don\u2122t think I have time to relate. Well, anyway, they were both very prosperous. My father\u2122s family had \u0152 Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 6there were two sisters and five brothers, seven. And my father, Oscar Politzer was the youngest. My mother\u2122s family, there were two older sisters and one younger brother. My mother\u2122s name was Marie, but she was all \u0152 always Mitzi , little Mitzi because she was tiny and very, very delicate. And all she really knew how to do was play the piano. That was the thing to do. And both households had a cook and a maid, and in my mother\u2122s family there was a mademoiselle that came several afternoons a week because you had to le arn another language, absolutely. And my father\u2122s family with the five boys especially, there was a sort of a tutor, another \u0152 another teacher who saw that homework was being done by these \u0152 by this big family. I \u0152 I think this is important to \u0152 to realize how very much entrenched this \u0152 both families were in Vienna. They were socially and financially very, very much Viennese."

He was supposed to \u0152 to, with his brother-in-law, my mother\u2122s brother, take over the business from my maternal grandfather, but things happened. Grandpa Berger was his name, was widowed er \u0152 er \u0152 ma \u0152 at age 60, and remarried a much, much younger woman, to the great distress of the children. And they had another child, and that other child, of course, was inheriting the business, instead of the son and son-in-law and that was Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 7that. So my father had \u0152 it\u2122s hard to \u0152 to translate it. He \u0152 he represented foreign firms. He was a businessman, and busi ness was not good. We\u2122re talking \u0152 my parents were married in 1914, beginning of the war. And the time between the wars was economically very bad in Europe . So we had everything a child would need. And besides, you didn\u2122t talk business with y our children. I was really not aware of what my father did. I wouldn\u2122t say I didn\u2122t care, but you just didn\u2122t discuss it with your children."

There was \u0152 she played the piano very well, and I guess she knew how to cook, because she had to learn it.

And that was that, and the opportunities, of course, in Vienna were tremendous. Our household was very much infused with music. We Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 10had a beautiful B\u00f6sendorfer. That\u2122s one of the big, big, beautiful pianos we had. Mother played quite a bit. My sister had piano lessons, seemed forever. And Mother tried piano lessons for me, but I just couldn\u2122t sit still long enough. So I \u0152 I had \u0152 Mother was my teacher for about three years and then we both gave up, and I\u2122m truly sorry I did, but I gave up. So I \u0152 I danced two, three afternoons a week.

Then in gymnasium you we nt to school every day fr om eight to one, and it c \u0152 also on Saturdays, so the \u0152 the dance classes came in the afternoon. And very early in life, I did a lot of performing. That was really what I \u0152 what I loved. One of my teachers was a \u0152 one of the soloists at the Staatsoper, and she had a studio on the side, and was also often asked to choreograph for the Burgtheater, which was the dramatic stage \u0152 this dramatic, state supported stage. And there I had all sorts of opportunities. I got paid something, which amounts to nowadays probably for about 10 cents. But at the time it was \u0152 it was great to have a little \u0152 little money to save, and I usually saved it up to go on a skiing trip, because that was the other \u0152 I would n \u0152 wouldn\u2122t know whether it was a hobb y, but everybody skied, and we also skated. I \u0152 we had membership to one of the ice skating rinks. And then every year, that was later on in gymnasium, the whole school, or those who couldn\u2122t ski well, they had to stay home, went somewhere for a week, into one of the youth hostels in Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 11the Alps, and just looking back on it, this wa s probably the most beautiful, best times we ever had."

It\u2122s hard to believe this nowadays, but you know, we didn\u2122t have television. We had just gotten a radio, and communications just weren\u2122t \u0152 and besides, I was 13 years old, I had too many other things I \u0152 I wanted to think about and do. So we \u0152 yes, we knew about Hitler, but that was about it. Then things became more serious. In 1934, and I remember that very well, that the Chancellor Dollfuss \u0152 I don\u2122t think one even knows the name here, was murdered. He was the \u0152 the Austrian chancellor. And it was very obvious that the Nazis from \u0152 the German Nazis were behind that terrible murder. It was in July, and I was on vacation at one of my aunt\u2122s villas on the lake. And we were very, very worried about what was really happening there. But then that calmed down. Dollfuss successor was Kurt von Schuschnigg , and he was a very, very different kind of chancellor. I remember Chancellor Dollfuss, he was a very short man, he was just five foot tall, and he was the butt of a lot of jokes. But he was a very popular man, he had a great deal of rappor t with the \u0152 with the people. And the \u0152 this new man, von Schuschnigg was a kind of a college professor type. Very serious, seemingly not a whole lot of sense of humor, and he was also at the time, the head of the Heimwehr. Heimwehr was sort of a militia type party, it was a different party. It was somewhere between the Nazis and the Soltsis(ph). And a lot of the Heimwehr \u0152 Heimwehr people were aristocrats that at one time of course Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 15were for the return of the Habsburgs . So he definitely lacked popular appeal. And I think he \u0152 he had absolutely no way of communicating with Hitler, he wasn\u2122t even trying. And he was the wrong type to ever meet up with Hitler. This is \u0152 this was 1934. The \u0152 1936, of course, was the year of the Olympics, which the museum so very, very beautifully, I tho ught that was a marvelous decision, whoever made it, to have that year show other Olympics, becaus e I remember that very well. I was very much into athletics and of course we realized that Hitler used this as a tremendous propaganda tool, the \u0152 the Olympic games. And we were so, so taken by this beautiful black man Jesse Owens. He was \u0152 but it was \u0152 it was very, very \u0152 there were several Austrian competitors, one or two of them were Jewish, who were not allowed to participate the last moment.

            "answer": "Not particularly. I think there were \u0152 there were signs that \u0152 that Hitler \u0152 it seems to me that \u0152 that Mr. Dollfuss and Mr. Schuschnigg were good friends with Mussolini. That was of course on our south, you know, we were in between. And Mussolini was \u0152 was very friendly to Austria and he \u0152 the way I \u0152 I read some of the stuff now in retrospect, after almost 60 years, he tried to \u0152 to tell Hitler to stay Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 18out of Austria , because I think he \u0152 he want \u0152 he was afraid of Hitler like everybody else. So when \u0152 when Hitler made moves to \u0152 which he did, to invite Schuschnigg to come to see him, Mussolini told him that he thought that was a mistake. And he also told Schuschnigg not to go. But I don\u2122t know what happened in 1937, but I know 1938, early 1938, January, February, Schuschnigg finally had to go to Berchtesgaden. And I remember that \u0152 that period very well, because I was in my last year of high school. And there was a sort of an unwritten law, at least it was \u0152 my parents insisted that I didn\u2122t go to any of the big carnival [indecipherable] it was called, until I was a senior in high school. So this was my \u0152 my time to go to \u0152 to balls, and \u0152 and the political situation seemed so \u0152 so uncertain and so \u0152 it was so, so gray, and so , so unpleasant that I was afraid they were all going to spoil my fun. But I did manage to go do some of the dances. But I do remember the time that Schuschnigg went to Berchtesgaden, I remember that \u0152 that very well, because even though we only had radio, it was all given over the radio and there was also something called \u0152 here it was called March of Time, I think. You went to the movies for just about 45 minutes, and you had the news there. So we \u0152 we got a lot of that through \u0152 through these films. And there were reports of how, for about two hours Hitler just raved and ranted and would not take \u0152 accept anything that Schuschnigg suggested. And Schuschnigg at the time had a Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 19minister \u0152 I don\u2122t know minist er of what, but his name was Guido Schmidt , who was really a Nazi. But he came with Schuschnigg and kind of egged him on and say oh, come on, give in, make a few little \u0152 little allowances. But it was a totally \u0152 total disaster, that meeting that he had with Hitler. He came home and if I remember right, I think it was a \u0152 it was a secret to the Austrian population that he was actually there. I don\u2122t think we knew about it until he came back. And it was a \u0152 I mean, we were told that it was no good, and Schuschnigg suggested a plebiscite. And Hitler said absolutely not. But Schuschnigg did it anyway. And that truly was the straw that broke the camel\u2122s back because that was just \u0152 Hitler was just waiting for \u0152 for an occasion. So on March 11th, he \u0152 his army crossed the border. And I remember that extremely well because I was at a dance rehearsal. See, by then I was \u0152 I was 17 going on 18 and I really \u0152 I was very serious about my dancing and this was gonna be a production of Faust, second part of Faust, under Max Reinhardt , and that \u0152 of course he was the \u0152 the \u0152 the god of the theater at the time. And this was Friday evening and the rehearsal was called off. And of course that whole thing was called off because Reinhardt was one of the first that crossed the border; he was smart, he left, Friday the 11 th. And then Saturday the Luftwaffe flew over Vienna and Sunday the 13th, Hitler came in. And I will never forget that, because even though we were told not to go da \u0152 out on the street, of course we \u0152 Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 20we young people wanted to see, no matter \u0152 whether we\u2122re for or against, but you \u0152 you wanted to see, and this Sunday night, I had tickets to go to the opera. I had a \u0152 a boyfriend at the time who was in his one year of army duty, military duty, and he had cheap tickets, or free tickets, probably. Well, you c ouldn\u2122t \u0152 you couldn\u2122t cross the street in front of the opera, I mean th \u0152 the ring \u0152 there\u2122s the \u0152 there\u2122s a big avenue that goes around the old town, ca lled the ring. And all along the ring are the beautiful buildings, like the opera, and the \u0152 the parliament, and the university and the Burgtheater and all that. Well, people stood 10 deep to see the parade, so we never made it to the opera. In fact, at the opera, people were hangi ng out fo \u0152 of the windows, and it was sort of stormed by th e \u0152 by the people who wanted to see the parade, and of course, Hitler himself, he was standing up in car with his right handed lifted, and so forth. So it was rather \u0152 rather impossible thing to erase out of your head, the noise \u0152"

So that\u2122s what I saw, and then, as I said before, my father took classes. I don\u2122t know whether this was pl umbing, or English, or wh atever it was he took, and he just didn\u2122t come home on \u0152 on \u0152 we always call it November 10th, because that was when it \u0152 when things were really \u0152 in Vienna were really unleashed. And we never saw him again. And that was \u0152 that was rough. No phone call, no anything. Somebody called a few days later saying I br ing regards and he\u2122s fine, and hung up. Well, it was somebody who was let out appa rently, for some reason or other. And much, much later, not too long ago in fact, I read a description of what happened to people. They herded them to one of the military installations in Vienna and they made them stand up for 24 hours, and th en \u0152 no \u0152 no water, no food, and then took them to the train stations. It was Novemb er, it was very cold. And the next thing they knew, they were in Dachau . And I\u2122ve \u0152 I read a lot about it because my mother never \u0152 never really heard, and I\u2122m glad she didn\u2122t, that there was quite a bit of torture going on, and horrible things. And what puzzles me very much, because my father had been in the war. He was in World War I. He was not a hero or anything, but he had served in the military. He was only 52 years old, not quite. He Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 38got to be 52 in January. And people got out. If you could prove that you \u0152 that you \u0152 that you gonna be out of the country within two weeks or something like that. And we \u0152 we moved heaven and earth. We had a nephew of my father\u2122s, a cousin of mine, who had been in Israel by the \u0152 at that time. He was a rabid Zionist and he had gone before things happened. And he \u0152 I think we telegrammed, and \u0152 and he somehow found a way, and we, you know, let them know that my father will be out, but nothing happened. And the \u0152 we have \u0152 I can show you that later, we have comcommunications. We have the correspondence of my father. I think after about two weeks we had a card saying I\u2122m fine, don\u2122t worry, you know? And we got about every other week, or something like this. I have donated the correspondence to the \u0152 to the Holocaust Museum, I don\u2122t know what they\u2122re gonna do with it. I made copies though, so I have it right here, I can let you have it. And on it, it says you have to have only so and so many lines, a nd be sure and date it, and I don\u2122t know what else, I mean you \u0152 you were really \u0152 you \u0152 you basically had to tell your family that you were fine, that \u0152 that was the thing. So that was it, and this was January \u0152 November, December. Our date of departure was 11th of January, which was my father\u2122s birthday, and we were so hoping that we \u0152 that he could get out and we could see him.

I think his \u0152 he died on the 23rd of January, and I th ink we landed on the 25 th, something like that. So it was \u0152 it was very cold in Newark, New Jersey and we started going into New York, which meant you had a little s \u0152 little streetcar ride that cost 10 cents. Then you did the Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 52Hudson tubes, which cost a nickel. And then you had the subway , another nickel. So there went, if it\u2122s a round trip, 40 cents went for transportation. And of course, if you were in New York and you were a whole day, you had to have lunch. So at Niddick\u2122s(ph) you could get a na \u0152 a frankfurt for four or five cents, and an orange drink for five cents. And if you were still hungry you could get a cream cheese and nut bread for five cents. So for, let\u2122s see, 40 cents fare and 15 cents, that\u2122s pretty good. You still didn\u2122t have to pay more than 55 cents for the day. So those 40 dollars went for \u0152 for quite some time, and everything else, our cousins were beautiful about it, and took care of us. My sister, as I said, then she gave up the \u0152 the job of taking care of children, and she at the time, of course, had \u0152 knew shorthand and typing and she was fluent in French. Her English was better than mine. So she found some secretarial work very quickly. And I got in touch with somebody who had \u0152 who was th e pianist for one of my dance teachers. He was in New York and I looked him up. He was also the nephew of somebody we knew, so it was almost like a friend. And he says well, he said, it just so happens that I got together with somebody from one of the cabarets in Vienna and they\u2122re forming a new group, and they found some sponsors , and maybe they can use a dancer. And I got in touch with this person who was \u0152 whose name was Herbert Berghof and he was very well known actor in Vienna, and I did my little twirling around with my Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 53dance dress, and I had a record on the re cord player. And he says, well, I think maybe we can use you. And they had just st arted rehearsal \u0152 this was in February \u0152 and we got rehearsal pay, 15 dollars a week. Now that\u2122s \u0152 that was good. That was very good. So I started rehearsing with this group. It wa s an interesting group, they were something called fromme a kleine kunst B\u00fchne, which literally translated means small stage theater. It was a \u0152 sort of a topical review that had been very successful in Vienna. And they got out quickly, because it was the kind of a topical review that made fun of politics, and \u0152 and they \u0152 they better \u0152 had to get out. So they met again in vien \u0152 in New York with Herbert Berghof as a director, and they had sponsors, a list of sponsors that you wouldn\u2122t believe. George S. Kaufman and his wife, Irving Berlin, Edna Ferber , down the list. They all \u0152 I don\u2122t \u0152 I have no idea how much money they \u0152 they gave, but it was a little corporation that was formed, called itself the refugee artists\u2122 group. And they got a theater and we opened a show in June 1939. And for \u0152 as I said, rehearsal pay was 15 dollars a week, and then when we opened, we got 40 dolla rs a week, which was the minimum that actors\u2122 equity paid. And you know, all the other refugees made anywhere from 12 dollars, 15 dollars, 20 do llars, but nobody made 40 dollars a week. So I really thought I had it made. This was summer 1939, it was terribly hot. There were all but four theaters opened on Broadway because they were the only Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 54four that had air conditioning. And the musi c box, where I was doing my thing, was one of them. It was just a glorious two month. And interestingly enough, for some reason or other, some time before I got in with that group and knew that it was really gonna do something, I had applied for college scholarships. That was another address I had, to be sure and go to the in ternational students\u2122 service, and apply for a scholarship. Of course, I did really not know what a scholarship was and I really didn\u2122t terribly want to go to college because I had done my Matura and I was not that brilliant a student. So I had applied anyway, and the woman there didn\u2122t speak German. I \u0152 my English was very broken, so we got along just fine and \u0152 and she said, well, you might hear from us. And so metime in August I got a beautiful letter from International Student Service that said, we have scholarship for you at Miami University in Oxford , Ohio. And I just had totally forgotten that I had ever applied. And I was so happy performing on Broadway , I really didn\u2122t want to do it. And there was some friends \u0152 friends of my cousin\u2122s, wonderful woman who lived in New York, who was in radio and the arts, says, you\u2122d be a darn fool if you wouldn\u2122t take this. Said, I don\u2122t want to. She said, well, you better. And of course, war clouds over Europe, very, very obvious things were going to \u0152 to be really bra \u0152 breaking there very quickly. And this show had very good critiques, but somehow Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 55we being refugees and foreigners, with the war breaking out, it was all a bad situation. We had to be fingerprinted because we were enemy aliens. So \u0152"

Yeah, I think things could be very different, very different. I can see it now. We go to Austria often. I have good friends there, I went back to my 50th high school reunion, and I stayed with a former classmate who was m \u0152 first time married to a pilot in the Luftwaffe. And she invited me. And I think it was almost \u0152 th-the invitation wi \u0152 to me was almost like Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 69a peace offering, it was wonderful. She \u0152 she just was as sweet and nice as you can be. And I heard a lot of stories that what happened to people wh o stayed over there. And some of the experiences were worse than mine."

And initially, maybe when it was first chartered, which I think was in 70 \u0152 1978 under Jimmy Carter , I said to myself, what do we need a museum right here in Washington for? I \u0152 really, this was my reaction. Which is strange, but \u0152 but that was it. I said, people are not gonna understand it. Which, yo u know, I had exp \u0152 experience with that, and that\u2122s why I never really \u0152 I never really talked about my experiences to anybody. My children didn\u2122t know about \u0152 about their grandfather until they were grown, because I had the feeling that was \u0152 was \u0152 I couldn\u2122t do it, I don\u2122t know.

Of course, you saw the picture of the \u0152 the railroad ca r coming into the museum, and all that, it got be kind of exciting. So when it \u0152 when it opened, and there was a little item in the paper about volunteers are \u0152 are being searched for, I \u0152 I applied. And I think the first visit was \u0152 is quite overwhelming. And I \u0152 I remember my sister and some other people said, how can you do that, how can you do that? And I still have a very good friend who was \u0152 was married to a Ge rman, and she said, I don\u2122t want to go there, I can\u2122t go there. Different people react differently.

He was \u0152 it was at a \u0152 the \u0152 at the concentra \u0152 conc-concentration camp hospital, and died there. So his \u0152 his ashes and \u0152 and belongings with a little package, you know, came \u0152 came to Mother. And something happened there, he \u0152 they \u0152 they wouldn \u2122t open the grave of his parents, so he\u2122s actually buried with his grandmother. Very, very strange.

I was \u0152 I would just come from \u0152 from \u0152 we \u0152 we spent two weeks in Europe in September, and we were \u0152 for one week we were in Austria in a little village way up in the Alps . And Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 82it\u2122s kind of interesting to see these young people, it\u2122s \u0152 Austria is \u0152 is booming, you know, it\u2122s very, very do \u0152 economy is doing ve ry well, and even the people up there that \u0152 what used to be peas ants, they\u2122re very \u0152 they sp eak English rather well, and you \u0152 you wonder what their grandparents did. In fact, that was my real reaction. I \u0152 there was a group of German kids at the museum, and it was such a happy coincidence because the \u0152 the museum should somehow be prepared to get foreign s-speaking people into the right places. Well, this was wonderful, this was a group of exchange students who were on their wa y back home, I think, they came \u0152 they were in Cleveland. And they were wonderful kids, very well behaved, but I really and truly said to myself, I wonder how mu ch they know about this, and I wonder if anyone\u2122s grandfather or great-grandparent was one of those SS people who did awful things, or what \u0152 what they know about it. Because for a few years now \u0152 I \u0152 I mean, y \u0152 I think now they\u2122re teaching it agai n in school, but let\u2122s say in the 50s or 60s, I don\u2122t think the schools in Germany were taught \u0152 taught about the Holocaust. I \u0152 I really don\u2122t think they were. Oh what? Yeah, really, does that happen? No, not here, kind of a thing."

I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m American, very much so. And I \u0152 in fact, I think as soon as I went away from New York, cause I went back a lot, because my mother was there \u0152 my sister still lives there. But as I started Miami University and went to college, and entered Wellesley and so, I was \u0152 was very bent on \u0152 on Americaniza tion. I was probably going to the other extreme. I wanted to not have an accent, I wanted to \u0152 to be Americanized. And, I don\u2122t know, then with American husband, of course, he was in the navy, you know, and his parents, Massachusetts, Boston. So I \u0152 I made a real effort the other way, maybe \u0152 maybe to the extreme, I don\u2122t know. But I feel very American. But when I go back to Austria the \u0152 the dialect comes back and I \u0152 I feel very much at home. It\u2122s a wonderful feeling. It\u2122s something that \u0152 that is kinda great when you go to a foreign country, but it\u2122s not a foreign country. It\u2122s very nice."
