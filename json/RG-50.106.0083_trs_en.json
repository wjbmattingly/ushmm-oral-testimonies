            "answer": "My full name is Hedi Pope. It at one time was Hedwig, but that was such a mouthful to put on your naturalization papers, so I permanently changed it to just Hedi Pope. I do not use a middle name."

            "question": "Tell me a little bit about your parents, how \u2014 and also how far back the family goes in Vienna.",
            "answer": "Okay. Both my parents came from rather prosperous, middle class, I guess you would call it. Both grandfathers were prominent businessmen in Austria. Grandfather Ludwig Politzer was born somewhere in the far reaches of the Hapsburg empire in what is now Hungary, I guess, and came to Vienna as a very young man, to learn the language and to absorb a little culture. That was the thing to do for young people with any kind of ambition, to come to the capital at the time. It was, of course, the cultural center, right after Paris and Rome and London. He had a very interesting gold and silver \u2014 he was a gold and silversmith in a ta \u2014 1n a stre \u2014 on a street that was called Papagenogasse, which is rather \u2014 rather very Viennese, you know, Papa Geno is one of the characters in \u201cThe Magic Flute.\u201d And a very interesting thing about Grandpa Politzer, we never really knew what kind of an artist he was, and in \u2014 in eight \u2014 in 1981, when the Metropolitan Museum had a beautiful exp \u2014 exhibit of Hapsburg treasures and \u2014 and costumes, we suddenly stood in front of a big, big [indecipherable] I call it, exhibit of jewelry that Hungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by Ludwig Politzer in circa \u2014 it said This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.  http://collections.ushmm.org  Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hedi Pope \u00b0 November 6, 1997 circa 1872. So my sister and I just \u2014 just \u2014 just couldn\u2019t believe it. I mean, this was just an unbelievable thing. We traced it down and it is now the property of the Imperial Museum in Budapest. And to try to get hold of somebody who knew something about it was \u2014 this was 1981, I said, was impossible. So I\u2019m still trying to figure out how I could see it one more time. But this was a \u2014 a beautiful thing. Also, he has a \u2014 a very interesting piece exhibited in one of the museums in Vienna. So unbeknownst to us when we lived in Vienna, he was apparently quite \u2014 quite an artist. The business was later on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of my father\u2019s, but I don\u2019t really know what happened. It doesn\u2019t exist any more. The other grandfather also came from somewhere in Hungary, as a very young man, about 15 years old, to learn something besides Hungarian. And he turned out to be a very well-known businessman. He had the most \u2014 best known haberdashery, I guess you would call it, on what would be the Fifth Avenue of Vienna, called Karntner Strasse. And once or twice a year he went to London and Paris for buying materials and \u2014 and \u2014 and for made-to-order suits for men and women. It was called the English fleet, the Englisch-Flotte, it was very well known, and it was, until about 10 years ago, carried on by a much younger child of hi \u2014 much younger than my mother\u2019s child, but that\u2019s a long family story that I don\u2019t think I have time to relate. Well, anyway, they were both very prosperous. My father\u2019s family had \u2014 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And my father, Oscar Politzer was the youngest. My mother\u2019s family, there were two older sisters and one younger brother. My mother\u2019s name was Marie, but she was all \u2014 always Mitzi, little Mitzi because she was tiny and very, very delicate. And all she really knew how to do was play the piano. That was the thing to do. And both households had a cook and a maid, and in my mother\u2019s family there was a mademoiselle that came several afternoons a week because you had to learn another language, absolutely. And my father\u2019s family with the five boys especially, there was a sort of a tutor, another \u2014 another teacher who saw that homework was being done by these \u2014 by this big family. I \u2014 I think this 1s important to \u2014 to realize how very much entrenched this \u2014 both families were in Vienna. They were socially and financially very, very much Viennese."

He was supposed to \u2014 to, with his brother-in-law, my mother\u2019s brother, take over the business from my maternal grandfather, but things happened. Grandpa Berger was his name, was widowed er \u2014 er \u2014 ma \u2014 at age 60, and remarried a much, much younger woman, to the great distress of the children. And they had another child, and that other child, of course, was inheriting the business, instead of the son and son-in-law and that was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So my father had \u2014 it\u2019s hard to \u2014 to translate it. He \u2014 he represented foreign firms. He was a businessman, and business was not good. We\u2019re talking \u2014 my parents were married in 1914, beginning of the war. And the time between the wars was economically very bad in Europe. So we had everything a child would need. And besides, you didn\u2019t talk business with your children. I was really not aware of what my father did. I wouldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t care, but you just didn\u2019t discuss it with your children."

There was \u2014 she played the piano very well, and I guess she knew how to cook, because she had to learn it.

That was \u2014 that was far away. It\u2019s hard to believe this nowadays, but you know, we didn\u2019t have television. We had just gotten a radio, and communications just weren\u2019t \u2014 and besides, I was 13 years old, I had too many other things I \u2014 I wanted to think about and do. So we \u2014 yes, we knew about Hitler, but that was about it. Then things became more serious. In 1934, and I remember that very well, that the Chancellor Dollfuss \u2014 I don\u2019t think one even knows the name here, was murdered. He was the \u2014 the Austrian chancellor. And it was very obvious that the Nazis from \u2014 the German Nazis were behind that terrible murder. It was in July, and I was on vacation at one of my aunt\u2019s villas on the lake. And we were very, very worried about what was really happening there. But then that calmed down. Dollfuss successor was Kurt von Schuschnigg, and he was a very, very different kind of chancellor. I remember Chancellor Dollfuss, he was a very short man, he was just five foot tall, and he was the butt of a lot of jokes. But he was a very popular man, he had a great deal of rapport with the \u2014 with the people. And the \u2014 this new man, von Schuschnigg was a kind of a college professor type. Very serious, seemingly not a whole lot of sense of humor, and he was also at the time, the head of the Heimwehr. Heimwehr was sort of a militia type party, 1t was a different party.

So he definitely lacked popular appeal. And I think he \u2014 he had absolutely no way of communicating with Hitler, he wasn\u2019t even trying. And he was the wrong type to ever meet up with Hitler.

I was very much into athletics and of course we realized that Hitler used this as a tremendous propaganda tool, the \u2014 the Olympic games. And we were so, so taken by this beautiful black man Jesse Owens. He was \u2014 but it was \u2014 it was very, very \u2014 there were several Austrian competitors, one or two of them were Jewish, who were not allowed to participate the last moment.

So when \u2014 when Hitler made moves to \u2014 which he did, to invite Schuschnigg to come to see him, Mussolini told him that he thought that was a mistake. And he also told Schuschnigg not to go. But I don\u2019t know what happened in 1937, but I know 1938, early 1938, January, February, Schuschnigg finally had to go to Berchtesgaden. And I remember that \u2014 that period very well, because I was in my last year of high school. And there was a sort of an unwritten law, at least it was \u2014 my parents insisted that I didn\u2019t go to any of the big carnival [indecipherable] it was called, until I was a senior in high school. So this was my \u2014 my time to go to \u2014 to balls, and \u2014 and the political situation seemed so \u2014 so uncertain and so \u2014 it was so, so gray, and so, so unpleasant that I was afraid they were all going to spoil my fun. But I did manage to go do some of the dances. But I do remember the time that Schuschnigg went to Berchtesgaden, I remember that \u2014 that very well, because even though we only had radio, it was all given over the radio and there was also something called \u2014 here it was called March of Time, I think. You went to the movies for just about 45 minutes, and you had the news there. So we \u2014 we got a lot of that through \u2014 through these films. And there were reports of how, for about two hours Hitler just raved and ranted and would not take \u2014 accept anything that Schuschnigg suggested.

But he came with Schuschnigg and kind of egged him on and say oh, come on, give in, make a few little \u2014 little allowances. But it was a totally \u2014 total disaster, that meeting that he had with Hitler. He came home and if I remember right, I think 1t was a \u2014 it was a secret to the Austrian population that he was actually there. I don\u2019t think we knew about it until he came back. And it was a \u2014 I mean, we were told that it was no good, and Schuschnigg suggested a plebiscite. And Hitler said absolutely not. But Schuschnigg did it anyway. And that truly was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back because that was just \u2014 Hitler was just waiting for \u2014 for an occasion. So on March 11\", he \u2014 his army crossed the border. And I remember that extremely well because I was at a dance rehearsal. See, by then I was \u2014 I was 17 going on 18 and I really \u2014 I was very serious about my dancing and this was gonna be a production of Faust, second part of Faust, under Max Reinhardt, and that \u2014 of course he was the \u2014 the \u2014 the god of the theater at the time. And this was Friday evening and the rehearsal was called off. And of course that whole thing was called off because Reinhardt was one of the first that crossed the border; he was smart, he left, Friday the 11. And then Saturday the Luftwaffe flew over Vienna and Sunday the 13\", Hitler came in.

And all along the ring are the beautiful buildings, like the opera, and the \u2014 the parliament, and the university and the Burgtheater and all that. Well, people stood 10 deep to see the parade, so we never made it to the opera. In fact, at the opera, people were hanging out fo \u2014 of the windows, and it was sort of stormed by the \u2014 by the people who wanted to see the parade, and of course, Hitler himself, he was standing up in car with his right handed lifted, and so forth.

Was a very interesting thing because I don\u2019t know whether this is still that way, but you \u2014 you needed a quota number. And if you wanted to know, you know, how many a month, they didn\u2019t really tell you at the embassy. But I remember at the time they said oh well, your number should come up around the first of the year. So this was, you know, a\u2014 738, so maybe by \u201939 we could \u2014 we could think of it. But I remember very well just stand in line at the U.S. embassy in Vienna and get a quota number. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then you had the subway, another nickel. So there went, if 1t\u2019s a round trip, 40 cents went for transportation. And of course, if you were in New York and you were a whole day, you had to have lunch. So at Niddick\u2019s(ph) you could get a na \u2014 a frankfurt for four or five cents, and an orange drink for five cents. And if you were still hungry you could get a cream cheese and nut bread for five cents. So for, let\u2019s see, 40 cents fare and 15 cents, that\u2019s pretty good. You still didn\u2019t have to pay more than 55 cents for the day. So those 40 dollars went for \u2014 for quite some time, and everything else, our cousins were beautiful about it, and took care of us. My sister, as I said, then she gave up the \u2014 the job of taking care of children, and she at the time, of course, had \u2014 knew shorthand and typing and she was fluent in French. Her English was better than mine. So she found some secretarial work very quickly. And I got in touch with somebody who had \u2014 who was the pianist for one of my dance teachers. He was in New York and I looked him up. He was also the nephew of somebody we knew, so it was almost like a friend. And he says well, he said, it just so happens that I got together with somebody from one of the cabarets in Vienna and they\u2019re forming a new group, and they found some sponsors, and maybe they can use a dancer. And I got in touch with this person who was \u2014 whose name was Herbert Berghof and he was very well known actor in Vienna, and I did my little twirling around with my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Now that\u2019s \u2014 that was good. That was very good. So I started rehearsing with this group. It was an interesting group, they were something called fromme a kleine kunst Buhne, which literally translated means small stage theater. It was a \u2014 sort of a topical review that had been very successful in Vienna. And they got out quickly, because it was the kind of a topical review that made fun of politics, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they better \u2014 had to get out. So they met again in vien \u2014 in New York with Herbert Berghof as a director, and they had sponsors, a list of sponsors that you wouldn\u2019t believe. George S. Kaufman and his wife, Irving Berlin, Edna Ferber, down the list. They all \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I have no idea how much money they \u2014 they gave, but it was a little corporation that was formed, called itself the refugee artists\u2019 group. And they got a theater and we opened a show in June 1939. And for \u2014 as I said, rehearsal pay was 15 dollars a week, and then when we opened, we got 40 dollars a week, which was the minimum that actors\u2019 equity paid. And you know, all the other refugees made anywhere from 12 dollars, 15 dollars, 20 dollars, but nobody made 40 dollars a week. So I really thought I had it made.

And the music box, where I was doing my thing, was one of them. It was just a glorious two month. And interestingly enough, for some reason or other, some time before I got in with that group and knew that it was really gonna do something, I had applied for college scholarships. That was another address I had, to be sure and go to the international students\u2019 service, and apply for a scholarship. Of course, I did really not know what a scholarship was and I really didn\u2019t terribly want to go to college because I had done my Matura and I was not that brilliant a student. So I had applied anyway, and the woman there didn\u2019t speak German. I \u2014 my English was very broken, so we got along just fine and \u2014 and she said, well, you might hear from us. And sometime in August I got a beautiful letter from International Student Service that said, we have scholarship for you at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. And I just had totally forgotten that I had ever applied. And I was so happy performing on Broadway, I really didn\u2019t want to do it.

I do that in German and I speak enough French too, to do it, and I enjoy that very much. I \u2014 I \u2014 it\u2019s \u20141t\u2019s difficult to admit, but my mother tongue 1s sort of gone away. It\u2019s difficult sometimes to \u2014 to express myself.

I\u2014I think the \u2014 the one \u2014 the little \u2014 little video on Austria, which is \u2014 1s very wrong in a way, because it doesn\u2019t show the many people that didn\u2019t go out there and yell heil Hitler; there were a lot of them. I mean, on the outside it looked as though they were welcoming Hitler, but there were a lot of them who didn\u2019t. The \u2014 let\u2019s see, seems to me there was a \u2014 a\u2014 one \u2014 one thing that gives me goose pimples every time I go up there, there is something called a Horst Wessel Lied, have you ever heard of that? Which became almost like an anthem, and we had to learn the words to it. And that \u2014 that is being played, you know, on the fourth floor. And every time I go up there and hear it, I just \u2014 just shiver a little bit. It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s a very kinesthetic experience. And the whole thing on Kristallnacht is \u2014 is to me is \u2014 1s very \u2014 very shattering. It\u2019s shattering to me, and sometimes I stand up there and people go up there and they look and then they walk right by. And I feel as though I want to shake them and say hey, read on, you know, that sort of thing. So I think that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s probably \u2014 but that\u2019s impossible to impart on anybody else.
