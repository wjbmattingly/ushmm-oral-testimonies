            "answer": "My full name is Hedi Pope. It at one time was Hedwig, but that was such a mouthful to put on your naturalization papers, so I permanently changed it to just Hedi Pope. I do not use a middle name."

            "question": "Tell me a little bit about your parents, how \u2014 and also how far back the family goes in Vienna.",
            "answer": "Okay. Both my parents came from rather prosperous, middle class, I guess you would call it. Both grandfathers were prominent businessmen in Austria. Grandfather Ludwig Politzer was born somewhere in the far reaches of the Hapsburg empire in what is now Hungary, I guess, and came to Vienna as a very young man, to learn the language and to absorb a little culture. That was the thing to do for young people with any kind of ambition, to come to the capital at the time. It was, of course, the cultural center, right after Paris and Rome and London. He had a very interesting gold and silver \u2014 he was a gold and silversmith in a ta \u2014 1n a stre \u2014 on a street that was called Papagenogasse, which is rather \u2014 rather very Viennese, you know, Papa Geno is one of the characters in \u201cThe Magic Flute.\u201d And a very interesting thing about Grandpa Politzer, we never really knew what kind of an artist he was, and in \u2014 in eight \u2014 in 1981, when the Metropolitan Museum had a beautiful exp \u2014 exhibit of Hapsburg treasures and \u2014 and costumes, we suddenly stood in front of a big, big [indecipherable] I call it, exhibit of jewelry that Hungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by Ludwig Politzer in circa \u2014 it said Interview with Hedi Pope \u00b0 November 6, 1997 circa 1872. So my sister and I just \u2014 just \u2014 just couldn\u2019t believe it. I mean, this was just an unbelievable thing. We traced it down and it is now the property of the Imperial Museum in Budapest. And to try to get hold of somebody who knew something about it was \u2014 this was 1981, I said, was impossible. So I\u2019m still trying to figure out how I could see it one more time. But this was a \u2014 a beautiful thing. Also, he has a \u2014 a very interesting piece exhibited in one of the museums in Vienna. So unbeknownst to us when we lived in Vienna, he was apparently quite \u2014 quite an artist. The business was later on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of my father\u2019s, but I don\u2019t really know what happened. It doesn\u2019t exist any more. The other grandfather also came from somewhere in Hungary, as a very young man, about 15 years old, to learn something besides Hungarian. And he turned out to be a very well-known businessman. He had the most \u2014 best known haberdashery, I guess you would call it, on what would be the Fifth Avenue of Vienna, called Karntner Strasse. And once or twice a year he went to London and Paris for buying materials and \u2014 and \u2014 and for made-to-order suits for men and women. It was called the English fleet, the Englisch-Flotte, it was very well known, and it was, until about 10 years ago, carried on by a much younger child of hi \u2014 much younger than my mother\u2019s child, but that\u2019s a long family story that I don\u2019t think I have time to relate. Well, anyway, they were both very prosperous. My father\u2019s family had \u2014 Interview with Hedi Pope \u00b0 November 6, 1997 there were two sisters and five brothers, seven. And my father, Oscar Politzer was the youngest. My mother\u2019s family, there were two older sisters and one younger brother. My mother\u2019s name was Marie, but she was all \u2014 always Mitzi, little Mitzi because she was tiny and very, very delicate. And all she really knew how to do was play the piano. That was the thing to do. And both households had a cook and a maid, and in my mother\u2019s family there was a mademoiselle that came several afternoons a week because you had to learn another language, absolutely. And my father\u2019s family with the five boys especially, there was a sort of a tutor, another \u2014 another teacher who saw that homework was being done by these \u2014 by this big family. I \u2014 I think this 1s important to \u2014 to realize how very much entrenched this \u2014 both families were in Vienna. They were socially and financially very, very much Viennese."

            "question": "And what kind of work did your father do?",
            "answer": "My father was, I guess you\u2019d call it a businessman. He was supposed to \u2014 to, with his brother-in-law, my mother\u2019s brother, take over the business from my maternal grandfather, but things happened. Grandpa Berger was his name, was widowed er \u2014 er \u2014 ma \u2014 at age 60, and remarried a much, much younger woman, to the great distress of the children. And they had another child, and that other child, of course, was inheriting the business, instead of the son and son-in-law and that was Interview with Hedi Pope \u2018 November 6, 1997 that. So my father had \u2014 it\u2019s hard to \u2014 to translate it. He \u2014 he represented foreign firms. He was a businessman, and business was not good. We\u2019re talking \u2014 my parents were married in 1914, beginning of the war. And the time between the wars was economically very bad in Europe. So we had everything a child would need. And besides, you didn\u2019t talk business with your children. I was really not aware of what my father did. I wouldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t care, but you just didn\u2019t discuss it with your children."

There was \u2014 she played the piano very well, and I guess she knew how to cook, because she had to learn it. But then we always had a maid or somebody else who cooked, so Mother didn\u2019t \u2014 I mean, she brought up my sister and me, but that was about it."

Even though you hear a lot and read a lot about rising anti-Semitism, I was not aware of it. I had friends \u2014 I had Jewish friends and I had, of course, the state religion, so to speak, in Austria was Catholic. So most people were Catholics, but there were some Protestants.

And after four years of elementary school, you had to decide whether you wanted to go to an eight year gymnasium, which was high school, or just four years of \u2014 which was called Hauptschule. Most of the time, if you just didn\u2019t make very good grades, and couldn\u2019t really do very well, you went to Hauptschule. Or if there was no money at all \u2014 cause you did pay a little bit for gymnasium. And children went to Hauptschule if they wanted to follow a trade. It\u2019s th-the sy \u2014 the school system 1s very ve \u2014 was very different and still is very different from he \u2014 here in the U.S. I went to a eight year gymnasium, which was very strict, very difficult and very, very cut and dry academic, I would say.

            "answer": "From age five on, I danced. I was gonna be a dancer, and I was gonna have a dance studio, somewhere. And that was that, and the opportunities, of course, in Vienna were tremendous. Our household was very much infused with music. We Interview with Hedi Pope \" November 6, 1997 had a beautiful Bosendorfer. That\u2019s one of the big, big, beautiful pianos we had. Mother played quite a bit. My sister had piano lessons, seemed forever. And Mother tried piano lessons for me, but I just couldn\u2019t sit still long enough. So I \u2014 I had \u2014 Mother was my teacher for about three years and then we both gave up, and I\u2019m truly sorry I did, but I gave up. So I \u2014 I danced two, three afternoons a week. You know, school was from about \u2014 well, em \u2014 elementary school it was from eight to 12. Then in gymnasium you went to school every day from eight to one, and it c \u2014 also on Saturdays, so the \u2014 the dance classes came in the afternoon. And very early in life, I did a lot of performing. That was really what I \u2014 what I loved. One of my teachers was a-\u2014 one of the soloists at the Staatsoper, and she had a studio on the side, and was also often asked to choreograph for the Burgtheater, which was the dramatic stage \u2014 this dramatic, state supported stage. And there I had all sorts of opportunities. I got paid something, which amounts to nowadays probably for about 10 cents. But at the time it was \u2014 it was great to have a little \u2014 little money to save, and I usually saved it up to go on a skiing trip, because that was the other \u2014 I would n\u2014 wouldn\u2019t know whether it was a hobby, but everybody skied, and we also skated. I\u2014 we had membership to one of the ice skating rinks. And then every year, that was later on in gymnasium, the whole school, or those who couldn\u2019t ski well, they had to stay home, went somewhere for a week, into one of the youth hostels in Interview with Hedi Pope \" November 6, 1997 the Alps, and just looking back on it, this was probably the most beautiful, best times we ever had."

I \u2014 my \u2014 my mother\u2019s brother George, he was two or three years younger than my mother, was terribly proud of his World War I record. He was in the cavalry, and it was hard to get into the cavalry. I don\u2019t know whether you had to pay somebody to get in, or it was the uniform, that beautiful red pants, red trousers and blue jacket that was expensive, but he was very proud to have been in the cavalry.

So there was this talk, and of course children pick up things. So neither one was particularly good, but the social democrats were the leading party after World War I. And I remember vaguely there was a kind of a \u2014 almost a little revolution. I think it was about \u201927 - 1927. Maybe I\u2019m thinking of 1931, I\u2019m not sure.

This was in \u201931. 1933, yes, we heard about Hitler, but that was Interview with Hedi Pope \" November 6, 1997 next door. That was \u2014 that was far away. It\u2019s hard to believe this nowadays, but you know, we didn\u2019t have television. We had just gotten a radio, and communications just weren\u2019t \u2014 and besides, I was 13 years old, I had too many other things I \u2014 I wanted to think about and do. So we \u2014 yes, we knew about Hitler, but that was about it. Then things became more serious. In 1934, and I remember that very well, that the Chancellor Dollfuss \u2014 I don\u2019t think one even knows the name here, was murdered. He was the \u2014 the Austrian chancellor. And it was very obvious that the Nazis from \u2014 the German Nazis were behind that terrible murder. It was in July, and I was on vacation at one of my aunt\u2019s villas on the lake. And we were very, very worried about what was really happening there. But then that calmed down. Dollfuss successor was Kurt von Schuschnigg, and he was a very, very different kind of chancellor. I remember Chancellor Dollfuss, he was a very short man, he was just five foot tall, and he was the butt of a lot of jokes. But he was a very popular man, he had a great deal of rapport with the \u2014 with the people. And the \u2014 this new man, von Schuschnigg was a kind of a college professor type. Very serious, seemingly not a whole lot of sense of humor, and he was also at the time, the head of the Heimwehr. Heimwehr was sort of a militia type party, 1t was a different party. It was somewhere between the Nazis and the Soltsis(ph). And a lot of the Heimwehr \u2014 Heimwehr people were aristocrats that at one time of course Interview with Hedi Pope : November 6, 1997 were for the return of the Habsburgs. So he definitely lacked popular appeal. And I think he \u2014 he had absolutely no way of communicating with Hitler, he wasn\u2019t even trying. And he was the wrong type to ever meet up with Hitler. This is \u2014 this was 1934. The \u2014 1936, of course, was the year of the Olympics, which the museum so very, very beautifully, I thought that was a marvelous decision, whoever made it, to have that year show other Olympics, because I remember that very well. I was very much into athletics and of course we realized that Hitler used this as a tremendous propaganda tool, the \u2014 the Olympic games. And we were so, so taken by this beautiful black man Jesse Owens. He was \u2014 but it was \u2014 it was very, very \u2014 there were several Austrian competitors, one or two of them were Jewish, who were not allowed to participate the last moment. So it was a very, very strained. It started \u2014 it started to be very, very strained."

Just not at all. This really didn\u2019t happen until after 1938. I had in s \u2014 in school, of course there was a \u2014 we knew that there was an underground. The underground Nazi Interview with Hedi Pope \u00b0 November 6, 1997 movement started when Schuschnigg came in because he \u2014 he did a lot of \u2014 lot of really very, very awkward things.

I think there were \u2014 there were signs that \u2014 that Hitler \u2014 it seems to me that \u2014 that Mr. Dollfuss and Mr. Schuschnigg were good friends with Mussolini. That was of course on our south, you know, we were in between. And Mussolini was \u2014 was very friendly to Austria and he \u2014 the way I \u2014 I read some of the stuff now in retrospect, after almost 60 years, he tried to \u2014 to tell Hitler to stay Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Hedi Pope \" November 6, 1997 out of Austria, because I think he \u2014 he want \u2014 he was afraid of Hitler like everybody else. So when \u2014 when Hitler made moves to \u2014 which he did, to invite Schuschnigg to come to see him, Mussolini told him that he thought that was a mistake. And he also told Schuschnigg not to go. But I don\u2019t know what happened in 1937, but I know 1938, early 1938, January, February, Schuschnigg finally had to go to Berchtesgaden. And I remember that \u2014 that period very well, because I was in my last year of high school. And there was a sort of an unwritten law, at least it was \u2014 my parents insisted that I didn\u2019t go to any of the big carnival [indecipherable] it was called, until I was a senior in high school. So this was my \u2014 my time to go to \u2014 to balls, and \u2014 and the political situation seemed so \u2014 so uncertain and so \u2014 it was so, so gray, and so, so unpleasant that I was afraid they were all going to spoil my fun. But I did manage to go do some of the dances. But I do remember the time that Schuschnigg went to Berchtesgaden, I remember that \u2014 that very well, because even though we only had radio, it was all given over the radio and there was also something called \u2014 here it was called March of Time, I think. You went to the movies for just about 45 minutes, and you had the news there. So we \u2014 we got a lot of that through \u2014 through these films. And there were reports of how, for about two hours Hitler just raved and ranted and would not take \u2014 accept anything that Schuschnigg suggested. And Schuschnigg at the time had a Interview with Hedi Pope \u00a9 November 6, 1997 minister \u2014 I don\u2019t know minister of what, but his name was Guido Schmidt, who was really a Nazi. But he came with Schuschnigg and kind of egged him on and say oh, come on, give in, make a few little \u2014 little allowances. But it was a totally \u2014 total disaster, that meeting that he had with Hitler. He came home and if I remember right, I think 1t was a \u2014 it was a secret to the Austrian population that he was actually there. I don\u2019t think we knew about it until he came back. And it was a \u2014 I mean, we were told that it was no good, and Schuschnigg suggested a plebiscite. And Hitler said absolutely not. But Schuschnigg did it anyway. And that truly was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back because that was just \u2014 Hitler was just waiting for \u2014 for an occasion. So on March 11\", he \u2014 his army crossed the border. And I remember that extremely well because I was at a dance rehearsal. See, by then I was \u2014 I was 17 going on 18 and I really \u2014 I was very serious about my dancing and this was gonna be a production of Faust, second part of Faust, under Max Reinhardt, and that \u2014 of course he was the \u2014 the \u2014 the god of the theater at the time. And this was Friday evening and the rehearsal was called off. And of course that whole thing was called off because Reinhardt was one of the first that crossed the border; he was smart, he left, Friday the 11. And then Saturday the Luftwaffe flew over Vienna and Sunday the 13\", Hitler came in. And I will never forget that, because even though we were told not to go da \u2014 out on the street, of course we \u2014 Interview with Hedi Pope November 6, 1997 we young people wanted to see, no matter \u2014 whether we\u2019re for or against, but you \u2014 you wanted to see, and this Sunday night, I had tickets to go to the opera. I had a\u2014a boyfriend at the time who was in his one year of army duty, military duty, and he had cheap tickets, or free tickets, probably. Well, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t cross the street in front of the opera, I mean th \u2014 the ring \u2014 there\u2019s the \u2014 there\u2019s a big avenue that goes around the old town, called the ring. And all along the ring are the beautiful buildings, like the opera, and the \u2014 the parliament, and the university and the Burgtheater and all that. Well, people stood 10 deep to see the parade, so we never made it to the opera. In fact, at the opera, people were hanging out fo \u2014 of the windows, and it was sort of stormed by the \u2014 by the people who wanted to see the parade, and of course, Hitler himself, he was standing up in car with his right handed lifted, and so forth. So it was rather \u2014 rather impossible thing to erase out of your head, the noise \u2014"

Right in the center of the city there was a \u2014I don\u2019t know he \u2014 whether he was the rabbi, or he was \u2014 he was just somebody with \u2014 threw a robe and a little yarmulke on his head, and two or three guys went just after him with \u2014 with a whip, you know.

You \u2014 you \u2014 you felt you should protect the poor man, but then again, if you did, then you got the whip. So it was this sort of thing all the time. So that\u2019s what I saw, and then, as I said before, my father took classes. I don\u2019t know whether this was plumbing, or English, or whatever it was he took, and he just didn\u2019t come home on \u2014 on \u2014 we always call it November 10\", because that was when it \u2014 when things were really \u2014 in Vienna were really unleashed. And we never saw him again. And that was \u2014 that was rough. No phone call, no anything. Somebody called a few days later saying I bring regards and he\u2019s fine, and hung up. Well, 1t was somebody who was let out apparently, for some reason or other. And much, much later, not too long ago in fact, I read a description of what happened to people. They herded them to one of the military installations in Vienna and they made them stand up for 24 hours, and then \u2014 no \u2014 no water, no food, and then took them to the train stations. It was November, it was very cold. And the next thing they knew, they were in Dachau. And I\u2019ve \u2014 I read a lot about it because my mother never \u2014 never really heard, and I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t, that there was quite a bit of torture going on, and horrible things. And what puzzles me very much, because my father had been in the war. He was in World War I. He was not a hero or anything, but he had served in the military. He was only 52 years old, not quite. He Interview with Hedi Pope . November 6, 1997 got to be 52 in January. And people got out. If you could prove that you \u2014 that you \u2014 that you gonna be out of the country within two weeks or something like that. And we \u2014 we moved heaven and earth. We had a nephew of my father\u2019s, a cousin of mine, who had been in Israel by the \u2014 at that time. He was a rabid Zionist and he had gone before things happened. And he \u2014 I think we telegrammed, and \u2014 and he somehow found a way, and we, you know, let them know that my father will be out, but nothing happened. And the \u2014 we have \u2014 I can show you that later, we have com- communications. We have the correspondence of my father. I think after about two weeks we had a card saying I\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry, you know? And we got about every other week, or something like this. I have donated the correspondence to the \u2014 to the Holocaust Museum, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re gonna do with it. I made copies though, so I have it right here, I can let you have it. And on it, it says you have to have only so and so many lines, and be sure and date it, and I don\u2019t know what else, I mean you \u2014 you were really \u2014 you \u2014 you basically had to tell your family that you were fine, that \u2014 that was the thing. So that was it, and this was January \u2014 November, December. Our date of departure was 11\" of January, which was my father\u2019s birthday, and we were so hoping that we \u2014 that he could get out and we could see him. And he \u2014 again and again wrote don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t change your plans. Don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t do it, so we wa \u2014 which we didn\u2019t.

And he immediately showed his World War I wound, and I don\u2019t know what happened from there, but they let him go and said, but you and your family have to be gone in a week. So here is, you know, your \u2014 your life suddenly, you got to \u2014 where do you go? And at the time the \u2014 his wife had a brother in Italy \u2014 I mean, the irony of going from Austria to Italy. But they did, Interview with Hedi Pope * November 6, 1997 they were safe with the young boy, who was eight years old at the time, my cousin Peter. And they went to Italy, and of course pretty soon they were thrown out of Italy, so they had to go to \u2014 to Cyprus. And then this \u2014 then they were thrown out of there, I\u2019m not sure what happened, but they ended up in Palestine, and were protected by the Anglican church. And my cousin, the young boy who was eight years old, is a very well-known university professor, Boston University. The \u2014 the man in sociology. So, you know, s-some \u2014 but I remember we ma \u2014 my mother and my sister and I packed up their stuff after they were gone, you know, they had to \u2014 to get out in one week. And we \u2014 we packed up their belongings and \u2014 and sent them to I don\u2019t know where, but they \u2014 they never caught up with them, so they \u2014 they had nothing."

I think his \u2014 he died on the 23\" of January, and I think we landed on the 25\", something like that. So it was \u2014 it was very cold in Newark, New Jersey and we started going into New York, which meant you had a little s \u2014 little streetcar ride that cost 10 cents. Then you did the Interview with Hedi Pope ~ November 6, 1997 Hudson tubes, which cost a nickel. And then you had the subway, another nickel. So there went, if 1t\u2019s a round trip, 40 cents went for transportation. And of course, if you were in New York and you were a whole day, you had to have lunch. So at Niddick\u2019s(ph) you could get a na \u2014 a frankfurt for four or five cents, and an orange drink for five cents. And if you were still hungry you could get a cream cheese and nut bread for five cents. So for, let\u2019s see, 40 cents fare and 15 cents, that\u2019s pretty good. You still didn\u2019t have to pay more than 55 cents for the day. So those 40 dollars went for \u2014 for quite some time, and everything else, our cousins were beautiful about it, and took care of us. My sister, as I said, then she gave up the \u2014 the job of taking care of children, and she at the time, of course, had \u2014 knew shorthand and typing and she was fluent in French. Her English was better than mine. So she found some secretarial work very quickly. And I got in touch with somebody who had \u2014 who was the pianist for one of my dance teachers. He was in New York and I looked him up. He was also the nephew of somebody we knew, so it was almost like a friend. And he says well, he said, it just so happens that I got together with somebody from one of the cabarets in Vienna and they\u2019re forming a new group, and they found some sponsors, and maybe they can use a dancer. And I got in touch with this person who was \u2014 whose name was Herbert Berghof and he was very well known actor in Vienna, and I did my little twirling around with my Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Hedi Pope ~ November 6, 1997 dance dress, and I had a record on the record player. And he says, well, I think maybe we can use you. And they had just started rehearsal \u2014 this was in February \u2014 and we got rehearsal pay, 15 dollars a week. Now that\u2019s \u2014 that was good. That was very good. So I started rehearsing with this group. It was an interesting group, they were something called fromme a kleine kunst Buhne, which literally translated means small stage theater. It was a \u2014 sort of a topical review that had been very successful in Vienna. And they got out quickly, because it was the kind of a topical review that made fun of politics, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they better \u2014 had to get out. So they met again in vien \u2014 in New York with Herbert Berghof as a director, and they had sponsors, a list of sponsors that you wouldn\u2019t believe. George S. Kaufman and his wife, Irving Berlin, Edna Ferber, down the list. They all \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I have no idea how much money they \u2014 they gave, but it was a little corporation that was formed, called itself the refugee artists\u2019 group. And they got a theater and we opened a show in June 1939. And for \u2014 as I said, rehearsal pay was 15 dollars a week, and then when we opened, we got 40 dollars a week, which was the minimum that actors\u2019 equity paid. And you know, all the other refugees made anywhere from 12 dollars, 15 dollars, 20 dollars, but nobody made 40 dollars a week. So I really thought I had it made. This was summer 1939, it was terribly hot. There were all but four theaters opened on Broadway because they were the only Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Hedi Pope ~ November 6, 1997 four that had air conditioning. And the music box, where I was doing my thing, was one of them. It was just a glorious two month. And interestingly enough, for some reason or other, some time before I got in with that group and knew that it was really gonna do something, I had applied for college scholarships. That was another address I had, to be sure and go to the international students\u2019 service, and apply for a scholarship. Of course, I did really not know what a scholarship was and I really didn\u2019t terribly want to go to college because I had done my Matura and I was not that brilliant a student. So I had applied anyway, and the woman there didn\u2019t speak German. I \u2014 my English was very broken, so we got along just fine and \u2014 and she said, well, you might hear from us. And sometime in August I got a beautiful letter from International Student Service that said, we have scholarship for you at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. And I just had totally forgotten that I had ever applied. And I was so happy performing on Broadway, I really didn\u2019t want to do it. And there was some friends \u2014 friends of my cousin\u2019s, wonderful woman who lived in New York, who was in radio and the arts, says, you\u2019d be a darn fool if you wouldn\u2019t take this. Said, I don\u2019t want to. She said, well, you better. And of course, war clouds over Europe, very, very obvious things were going to \u2014 to be really bra \u2014 breaking there very quickly. And this show had very good critiques, but somehow Interview with Hedi Pope * November 6, 1997 we being refugees and foreigners, with the war breaking out, 1t was all a bad situation. We had to be fingerprinted because we were enemy aliens. So \u2014"

And initially, maybe when it was first chartered, which I think was in 70 \u2014 1978 under Jimmy Carter, I said to myself, what do we need a museum right here in Washington for? I \u2014 really, this was my reaction. Which 1s strange, but \u2014 but that was it. I said, people are not gonna understand it. Which, you know, I had exp \u2014 experience with that, and that\u2019s why I never really \u2014 I never really talked about my experiences to anybody. My children didn\u2019t know about \u2014 about their grandfather until they were grown, because I had the feeling that was \u2014 was \u2014 I couldn\u2019t do it, I don\u2019t know.

Of course, you saw the picture of the \u2014 the railroad car coming into the museum, and all that, it got be kind of exciting. So when it \u2014 when it opened, and there was a little item in the paper about volunteers are \u2014 are being searched for, I \u2014 I applied. And I think the first visit was \u2014 1s quite overwhelming. And I \u2014 I remember my sister and some other people said, how can you do that, how can you do that? And I still have a very good friend who was \u2014 was married to a German, and she said, I don\u2019t want to go there, I can\u2019t go there. Different people react differently.

The \u2014 let\u2019s see, seems to me there was a \u2014 a\u2014 one \u2014 one thing that gives me goose pimples every time I go up there, there is something called a Horst Wessel Lied, have you ever heard of that?

And he, in fact, writes a lot and talks a lot about religion. Was on television with Bill Moyers not too long ago, and he Interview with Hedi Pope i November 6, 1997 considers himself a \u2014 maybe not a Christian, but \u2014 but forgets about it. So this 1s a \u2014 I think the har \u2014 the \u2014 what has happened has a lot to do with it. He maybe felt angry too. Hey, if you don\u2019t want me, I don\u2019t want you kind of a feeling. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s hard to analyze."

I was \u2014 I would just come from \u2014 from \u2014 we \u2014 we spent two weeks in Europe in September, and we were \u2014 for one week we were in Austria in a little village way up in the Alps. And Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Hedi Pope ia November 6, 1997 it\u2019s kind of interesting to see these young people, it\u2019s \u2014 Austria is \u2014 is booming, you know, it\u2019s very, very do \u2014 economy is doing very well, and even the people up there that \u2014 what used to be peasants, they\u2019re very \u2014 they speak English rather well, and you \u2014 you wonder what their grandparents did. In fact, that was my real reaction. I \u2014 there was a group of German kids at the museum, and it was such a happy coincidence because the \u2014 the museum should somehow be prepared to get foreign s-speaking people into the right places. Well, this was wonderful, this was a group of exchange students who were on their way back home, I think, they came \u2014 they were in Cleveland. And they were wonderful kids, very well behaved, but I really and truly said to myself, I wonder how much they know about this, and I wonder if anyone\u2019s grandfather or great-grandparent was one of those SS people who did awful things, or what \u2014 what they know about it. Because for a few years now \u2014 I \u2014 I mean, y \u2014 I think now they\u2019re teaching it again in school, but let\u2019s say in the 50s or 60s, I don\u2019t think the schools in Germany were taught \u2014 taught about the Holocaust. I \u2014 I really don\u2019t think they were. Oh what? Yeah, really, does that happen? No, not here, kind of a thing."

And I \u2014 in fact, I think as soon as I went away from New York, cause I went back a lot, because my mother was there \u2014 my sister still lives there. But as I started Miami University and went to college, and entered Wellesley and so, I was \u2014 was very bent on \u2014 on Americanization. I was probably going to the other extreme. I wanted to not have an accent, I wanted to \u2014 to be Americanized. And, I don\u2019t know, then with American husband, of course, he was in the navy, you know, and his parents, Massachusetts, Boston. So I \u2014 I made a real effort the other way, maybe \u2014 maybe to the extreme, I don\u2019t know. But I feel very American. But when I go back to Austria the \u2014 the dialect comes back and I \u2014 I feel very much at home. It\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s something that \u2014 that is kinda great when you go to a foreign country, but it\u2019s not a foreign country. It\u2019s very nice."
