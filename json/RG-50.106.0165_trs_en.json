And as a result of that, he could not practice law in Poland. So I think he just managed real estate properties for my gran dfather, including the one that we lived in, that I mentioned earlier."

And these -- Polish Jewish assimilated culture, as it was explained to me, peopl e did not pair off until they married. So they did things in groups, went into the woods to find -- excuse me -- edible mushrooms. Took vacations together, and -- as teenagers in -- at the Baltic in a resort known as Sopot, S-o-p-o-t . And then, in their early 20\u2122s they paired off and my parents paired o ff and married. I think my father was -- my parents were 22 at the time. My father, by the way, was the youngest of six or seven, I for -- forget, two of whom survived the war, besides my father, but did not escape, they were -- they were in -- in the ge-German labor camps in Germany, two sisters. And at that time, un-unde r Polish Jewish tradition, you weren't Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 5supposed to marry until your sisters marrie d. So this was an elopement because it was a-against the tradition of the family. But somehow i-it all worked out."

A-A-As the war approached, as -- strike that -- as it became clear, or clearer that Poland was in jeopardy from an -- German attack, the Poles made some Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 6decisions which changed my parents fortunes greatly and to the worse. Pole -- the Polish government passed a decree in -- I be lieve in the summer or spring of 1939, which was aimed at Jews, and to a lesser extent at Germans who controlled almost all of Polish industry at the time, that hard currencies, nonzlotys, held abroad by Poles, had to be repatriated a nd converted to Polish money, the zloty. That law was, as you might imagine, not totally adhered to. In fact, there is now quite a number of cases involving funds that were put in Switzerland in secret accounts by precisely -- by contemporaries of my grandfather who were faced with this situation and whose heirs are now either r eceiving or just seeking to prove that -- that these funds were theirs. But any event, my grandfather had considerable sums abroad in -- particularly in Switzerland and in New York and London, i-in the order of millions of dollars. And in part because he was a Polish patriot and in part because he was fearful of not breaking the law, all of th is money was repatriated to Poland , and there were no funds in New York , there were no funds in any other place. So, when my parents eventually arrived in New York with a one week visa to stay in the United States , they were -- they were destitute, pa -- financially destitute. Interestingly, my father -- a-as you recall, in 1939 there was a World\u2122s Fair in New York , and the ability of Poles, particularly of -- of people of means to get U.S. visas to visit the World\u2122s Fair was -- wa -- things kind of opened up, you Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 7could -- you could get a -- a visa to go to the World\u2122s Fair, and you could take a ship from Poland or from France and come here tha -- in the summer of 1939. My father proposed to my grandfather that he -- when this law was passed, that he sign hi -- these assets over to my father and that my father come ostensibly to visit the World\u2122s Fair, but he had the impression, which was probably correct, that if he was sitting in New York with four or five million dollars, that you could probably find a -- a ways and means not to get kicked out. But my grandfather vetoed the plan and I often wondered how my life would have changed if -- for the better or for the worse, had he said, all right, go to New York, and if they had arrived in New York in that fashion rather than in the rather different circumstances that brought us to the United States."

My father\u2122s resentment against Poland , which he held until his death in 1993, wa s really centered around Polish anti-S-Semitism that was displayed after the war began, and during the war. And he wrote many letters, some to the New York Times, some of -- of which were published, to the Jewish publications and so on and was e-extremely active in Jewish charities during his life and gave a -- a -- particularly the United Jewish Appeal.

Did -- did they tell you that they tried, besides the New York World\u2122s Fair, tried to get out in any other wa -- any other way?",

He spoke Russian and German. He traveled some with my grandfather. I was conceived on a cruise to the fjords of Norway. So he was a -- h-he -- the radio at that time -- and I remember my father telling me about listening to the speeches of Adolf Hitler on th-the radio, of course. Warsaw was not that far from Berlin and everyone had a shortwave set so you could listen to -- to the German radio, and my father being fairly fluent in German could understand Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 10Hitler\u2122s speeches and how mesmerizing Hitler was, although he disagreed with, obviously with everything that he had to say. So they were ris -- I would say my father particularly but my mother as well, were resourceful people who, at a very critical stage in the war, in the first weeks of the war, took some dramatic steps to save their lives and my life.

            "answer": "No. I -- w-wa -- when the war -- as you know, when the war began in the first week of September, my father, who had somewhat impaired vision and was also Jewish, for both those reasons was not draf ted into the Polish army. But -- and the war began, either -- I\u2122m not clear whether it was on a volunteer basis or on a draft basis, was inducted into a kind of home army or home civil defense corps, whowhose primary task was to fill sandbags ar ound public buildings and to clear the rubble from the German bombings. And t-to put up defenses as it were against -- ba -- sandbags against th-the prospect of -- of other public monuments and buildings being bombed in subsequent days. In any event this was almost a full-time job, he just was rarely home, as that was reported to me. In about the 12 th day of the war, he was working alongside a stranger who happened -- a Gentile, who happened to be a taxi driver. And they began talking about what a good idea it might be for both families to get the heck out of Warsaw , since the bombing was continuing and intensifying, and since the evidence from the BBC and from German radio, if not Polish radio was that the G-Germans were coming closer and you could hear the artillery fire from three sides. So the problem was that the taxi driver didn\u2122t have any gas for his taxi. And this part was always -- I never could get my father to quite explain whether he had a stas h of gasoline or he had a stash of gold, or he knew how on the black market to get it, it was always fuzzy. But the bottom line is, my Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 12father procured gas for this taxi. So taxi plus gas meant that both families fled in the dawn hours of September 13 th. I think a day or so, or maybe hours before -- you can check it -- the -- the bridges across the Vistula were severed. Warsaw itself held out against German attack until the end of the month. And some people also escaped by boat and so on and found ways out. But basically we left and traveled east, around the time that that opportunity shut down. Others traveled south toward Romania and survived, but we traveled due ea st until the taxi ran out of gas, and then we separated from the taxi driver and his family and we somehow got a horse and cart and kept going east."

He was operating on the fringes of the galaxy, but during that time there was a pr ogressive tightening of the noose by the Soviets. At first it was to insist on a change of government that was more friendly to the Soviet point of view, then that gove rnment invited, quote unquote, Soviets to open bases in Lithuania and eventually that led to a de facto Soviet occupation much like the S-Syrians in Lebanon and then finally to annexation of Lithuania as a SSR as the Soviet Socialist Republic, which it continued to be until 1991. So we lived through all of that, and during the time we were in Lithuania , the -- the Soviet presence and the s -- importance of the Soviets materially increased. Now, my father, if I may continue, didn\u2122t stay in Lithuania because he was -- and again, he was very vague on this, whether he was in the underground, or whether it, as is mostly presented to me, that he wanted to get his father out, who was in Warsaw.

The reason is that basically they survived World War I, and while there were privations and problems, and several armies swept through Warsaw , the Prussians, the Austrians, the Russians and so on, basically civilians survived and were not considered combatants.

At -- by that time, the Polish Lithuanian border was patrolled both by Soviet and Lithuanian troops, bu t not jointly. And on his way back from the second, futile mission to Warsaw , he was walking along the railroad track in the snow with the pair of pants that ended up in the museum, and he was a-aarrested, I guess, or -- by a Lithuanian patrol. My father said that had he encountered a Soviet patrol there would ha ve been no question that he would have been shot, because he had no proper papers or -- you know, he was a Pole at -- with -- at least suspicious, and probably a spy. Any event, the Lithuanians, according to Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 19my father\u2122s story, took him to their outpos t, gave him his watch and gave him his money, gave him his shoes, and was kind of held there for overnight, and in the morning, not knowing what his fate would be, the -- the captain, who was somewhat educated, said, we \u2122ve been thinking about your situation and what we\u2122ve decided is that we\u2122re going to ask you a question. And based on your answer to this question, quite frankly, we\u2122re either going to sh -- let you go or shoot you. Which was -- kind of concentrated his mind. So th e question, which my father repeated in Lithuanian is, or was -- [speaks Lithuanian here]. Is Roosevelt -- President Roosevelt a Jew? And my father\u2122s response, ac cording to my father was, what a silly question, why would you ask me a question like that? Everybody knows Roosevelt\u2122s Jewish. And then they said, all right, get out of here. And he walked in the snow in his socks and somehow made it back to Wilno.

So in th at winter, he en -- made a really great effort to try to get out and we were very fortunate that through a strange series of circumstances we were able to leave. And it -- we may be described as a trifecta i-in the sense that there were three elements to -- to it, and if any of the three elements failed, we would have not survived. The first element was a -- a Dutchman who was the honorary cons ul of the Dutch government in Lithuania and whose job was to sell Philips radios. And he decided th at anyone who applied could get residence in Cura\u00e7ao which was then a Dutch colony. Course, what was not known is that the governor of Cura\u00e7ao was not allowing anybody to get in, but you could get a piece of paper that said you had residence status or invitation to become a resident of the island of Cura\u00e7ao. And with that piece of paper you could then seek transit visas to get to Cura\u00e7ao. You needed basically three visas. You needed a Russian -- Soviet visa, you needed a Japanese visa, then you needed to cross the Atlantic and get an American visa to get you to Cura\u00e7ao. So there was in -- and this is very well known and we don\u2122t have to go into de tail about this, there was a Japanese council in Lithuania, in the Lithuanian capital, kow -- kow -- Kowsis?

            "answer": "Kaunas -- named Sigahura , who -- who I -- whose widow I met at the Japanese embassy some years ago, and who issued 2200 of -- of these transit visas to Japan, which he did wi -- against the express orde rs of the Japanese foreign ministry in Tokyo -- to Jews. And our names and the record is there, it\u2122s on the internet, too. We got three of these, and with that -- that was two -- two parts of the trifecta. The third part -- and this part is less well known and deserves to be discussed in some detail, was to get the Soviet -- permission from the Soviets to leave Vilnius and to travel to Japan. And they were selling a package deal, where you got the visa, and the ticket on the Trans-Siberian railroad, which at that time was something like a 16 day trip from Moscow to Vladivostok . And if you ask what I remember, I remember that trip very vividly, because it was in the winter of 1940, and it was very cold, and I guess I was tur -- just turning five. So the first problem was how to get -- because the Soviets said, the only way you could get this -- and we needed 600 dollars for three visas, the only way you get six -- the only -- excuse me, the only way the Soviets would do business with you was in dollars. And any resident of Vilnius who was caught with dollars on his or her possession was automatically shipped to Siberia, but not with a visa, and so it was a kind of a catch 22. You needed the dollars in order to get the visas, but if you had the dollars that was Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 22prima facie evidence that you were -- had illegal currency and you were subject to immediate arrest. My father -- I don\u2122t know if this is part of this -- I guess, surviving the Holocaust, so we can go wi -- through this if you like. My father came up with an ingenious plan. He had a do uble envelope. He put the money in an envelope, and in the o -- in the outer envelo pe he said, this money is to be used solely and only for the purpose of attaini ng three exit visas and tr-tr -- or rather, transit visas to -- through the Soviet Union. And some of these visas were granted, and some people were arrested, as I was told. And some visas were not granted, but they were not arrested. Almost all the interviews took place around three or four in the morning tha -- you were summoned to the KGB headquarters where all this was happening in downtown Vilnius. And among the questions that were asked was, if you do go to the new world, if you do get to the United States, w-would you be interested in helping us, helping the great Soviet Union complete its mission of liberating the world. In other words, would you s -- become a -- a spy, or an agent. So this was a very difficult time. And the third part of this trifecta, I think my father is proudest of having navigated that pa rticular rapids. And so we did get those visas, and we did go to Moscow , I do remember Moscow in 1941."

He contacted my -- his father\u2122s broker, my grandfather\u2122s broker, who -- I -- I don\u2122t know if they lent him some mone y, they possibly did. But since my grandfather had millions of dollars invested in Wall Street, they -- until he pulled it out, they -- I mean, they wrote a le -- a letter of reference for my father, which he sought to use effectively with the immigration au thorities stalling them from deporting him because we were illegal aliens. And while that case was pending against us, trying to get us to leave the country, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and started World War II. And under Am erican law at the time, my father, Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 34who was a lawyer, as I said, was familiar with American immigration law, and we -- and then -- st -- st -- Justice Department had every right to deport us. But under U.S. law they could only deport us to the country that we had immediately entered from, which was the empire of Japan. Or our native country, which was the Poland that was under German occupation. So they said you had to leave, but there was a catch 22 there in our favor. They couldn\u2122t tell us where to go, cause there was no place to go. And then, during the war, of course, th-there was -- as you know, under the immigration law there was a Polish quota, and that Polish quota for immigrants was subscribed until something like 1960, 20 years. But President Roosevelt signed an executive order that basically said that unfilled slots, that is people who were supposed to arrive say in 1942, but didn\u2122t arrive because they were trapped behind German lines, an -- those slots could be filled by people who have -- who are otherwise of good char acter, never mind how they got here.

And so I\u2122ve had these adult experiences.

And so that -- that weighed heavily with my father, that Auschwitz was in Poland and others, may -- five, six major death camps. And that, you know, th-the numbers there are very star k. There was, at the time that the war began -- I told you earlier [indecipherable] story of our flight, there were 3,100,000 Jews living in Poland. And while it\u2122s not -- the numbers are not quite precise, they range between 100,000 and 150, 000 who survived out of that total, who were in Poland when the war began.

He was State Justice Commerce Appropriations Chair John J. Rooney. And they pointed out to Rooney that Interview with Andrew Glass February 14, 2005 52nobody asked about the citizenship when two of my wife\u2122s brothers were killed in World War II, and so why were they raising these questions now? And so Rooney made a -- a call to the State Department and -- or passed a private bill, or -- no, I think he just made a call to the State De partment, she was on the next boat back from Naples. And I told that story in a column that I wrote about, and that made an impression on me that, you know, here were two relatively successful -- a Harvard educated psychiatrist and a Washington Bureau Chief who were, you know, from illegal aliens, so give me a break. So th at was -- but that was a 600 word column, so that [indecipherable] ma-made an impact, on me anyway."

And so we had a correspondent there because Cox had invested in -- in that newspaper after the fall of communism, helped them out. It was -- turned out to be a very good investment, we\u2122re de-investing it now, but made a lot of money. Anyway, I had so mething to do with that. So we -- we had this -- and I would make trips to Poland to help the newspape rs set -- set it a -- set up and exchange news, so I gave that news to the Gazetta correspondent who was working in the Cox bureau, and so they had a big exclusive that Bush was coming to Poland on a -- on -- on -- on good authority.
