To emigrate was relatively easy in the early years of Hitler. But to get permits to America, to Australia, to some of the other countries, was relatively difficult.

I could not for the life of me understand why the SS would ask that question, but at that time I spoke reasonably fluent Hebrew.

Somebody was a carpenter, or a locksmith, or a bricklayer, or a welder, they were safe.

            "answer": "Again a photo taken by the press photographer. Regrettably, neither I nor any of the persons whom I have consulted, know the name of that person. That\u2019s my wife, Rifka, and we\u2019ve been married now for 57 years, and hopefully it\u2019Il last. This is my daughter Ruth, her son Anthony, her daughter Emily, her son Adam, and her son Daniel. These are the three children of my son. This 1s Elizabeth, this is Jeremy, this is Rachel. All of them students at Melbourne University at the moment. This is a document confirming my status as a refugee. This is a diploma confirming that I have successfully completed my apprenticeship as a dental technician in Geneva. This is a do -- my -- the first 116 Interview with Gert Silver March 30, 2006 document issued to me after the war in 1946. This was issued by the Swiss government. Until then, I had no documentation whatsoever that I existed, or who I was. This is a passport photo of me, taken in 1946, 60 years ago. You can tell the difference. This is a travel document, issued to me by the Swiss government in 1947. I needed it because it was the first time I left Switzerland for Berlin to visit my uncle. This photo 1s of my son Denny. He lives in Castlemaine, about 150 kilometers north of Melbourne. He\u2019s a medical practitioner by profession, but a very dedicated and enthusiastic musician, and at the moment he is the director of the Melbourne Mandolin orchestra. You asked me earlier whether I recollect the interview by Professor Boder. That interview took place, I believe in August 1946, approximately 14 months after my arrival in Switzerland from Buchenwald. During that period, and in the month after that, we were interviewed almost on a weekly basis, by the Swiss government, the Swiss Red Cross, Swiss newspapers, Swiss radio stations, Jewish organizations in Switzerland, America, Canada, Australia and South America. We averaged, as I said, about one interview a week and I really do not recollect that particular interview."
