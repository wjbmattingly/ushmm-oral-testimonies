I mean, if I read the literature today of how Jews were treated in the immediate pre-Hitler period, and after Hitler came to power, it was relatively easy to leave Germany. Why my parents didn\u2122t leave, I will never know, but they were not alone, I mean, there were possibly a hundred thousand Jews in-in -- in Germany, maybe even more, who stayed in Germany.

And why my parents didn\u2122t leave, I will never know. I mean, it wasn\u2122t always easy, reading the literature now, to get permits to emigrate -- or to immigrat e, rather. To emigrate was relatively easy in the early years of Hitler. But to get permits to America, to Australia, to some of the other countries, was relatively difficult. I think the only country that admitted Jews in unlimited numbers was Shanghai, and I think the Dominican Republic."

And secondly, it\u2122s really, I think impossible for anybody to fully comprehend what happened there, and I didn\u2122t want to burden them with the trauma, I wanted them to have as normal an upbringing a-as possible, without being neurotic about what happened in the past. Perhaps I\u2122ve done the right thing, perhaps I\u2122ve done the wrong thin g, I don\u2122t know. I mean, my children know all about it, they\u2122ve seen the sp -- the tape that I -- came from the Spielberg interview, so it\u2122s not that they don\u2122t know about it, but we don\u2122t talk about it."

We are worried about the longevity of tapes. That is an article that appeared in a Swiss newspaper, on the day, or after the day of our arrival in Switzerland on the 23 rd of June, 1945. We arrived from Buchenwald and the article, in the German language, describes basically how we came th ere, why we came there, and basically a little bit of background that we had all spent time in a concentration camp, and that we came to Switzerland for recuperation.

This is a travel document, issued to me by the Swiss government in 1947. I needed it because it was the first time I left Switzerland for Berlin to visit my uncle. This photo is of my son Denny. He lives in Castlemaine, about 150 kilometers north of Melbourne. He\u2122s a medical practitioner by profession, but a very dedicated and enthusias tic musician, and at the moment he is the director of the Melbourne Mandolin orchestra. You asked me earlier whether I recollect the interview by Professor Boder. That interview took place, I believe in August 1946, approximately 14 months after my arrival in Switzerland from Buchenwald. During that period, and in the month af ter that, we were interviewed almost on a weekly basis, by the Swiss government , the Swiss Red Cross, Swiss newspapers, Swiss radio stations, Jewish organizations in Switzerland, America, Canada, Australia and South America.
