            "question": "Okay, it\u2019s June the 13\" of the year 2000 and we are in the home of Alexander Rosenberg for an oral history interview that\u2019s mainly going to focus on his experiences after the Holocaust because he has been interviewed by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation once before. And we\u2019re mainly going to be following up on that interview and asking some pre-war and wartime questions to clarify and expand and then moving on into the post-war era. And my name 1s Arwen Donahue and we are in Louisville, Kentucky, this is tape number one, side A. I guess what I\u2019 Il do is just briefly summarize for the tape some of what was discussed in your first interview and then you can correct me if I get anything wrong. So, Mr. Rosenberg was born in 1927 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and moved with his family in 1937 to... well, moved to Berlin and between then and 1937 and then moved to Holland in 1937, where he lived until he and his family were deported to the Westerbork camp in Holland. And were there, and that was, you said you weren\u2019t certain whether it was 1942 or \u201943, when you were...?",
            "answer": "That is correct. I keep thinking it was September of *42 and we were there until the beginning of \u201843. My brother thinks I\u2019m off by a year, but I think he\u2019s off by a year. I clearly remember 1 Easter of \u201844 and we had to have been there about a year by that time, so I think my dates are correct."

            "question": "And Easter of \u201844 what you remembered was being in Bergen-Belsen.",
            "answer": "That is correct. Yeah, it was an air attack... well, a group of B-17\u2019s was returning from a bomb run, possibly Hanover, and the escorting fighter planes came down to have a look. And our super-smart guards decided to let go with machine guns from the guard towers and they fired back. And nobody got hurt, but I clearly remember that incident."

            "question": "I wanted to ask you a little bit more about Bergen-Belsen, but I guess first what we\u2019ll do 1s... okay, so you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen some undetermined date. And then were in Bergen-Belsen until 1944.",

            "answer": "Yeah, east, Tribitz (ph) was the name of the little village, which is about ten, 15 miles east of Torgau. Torgau is on the river Elbe, where the German and Russian troops met on that same day, April the twenty-third, that we were liberated early in the morning by the Russian army."

And you had mentioned in your first interview something about your family. Your father was an investment banker. You had a brother who was ten months... was he ten months older or younger?",
            "answer": "Younger, younger."
        },
        {
            "num": 11,
            "question": "Ten months younger. And did you, and you said that your family was not very religious. You basically went to synagogue for high holidays. Was your family really very assimilated?",
            "answer": "Yes, I would say so, with hindsight in particular I would say so. Yes. My dad certainly considered himself German first and never expected the violence to get to the level that it did. And certainly would not affect him since he was a veteran of World War One that was wounded. Had volunteered for the army in the first place and was wounded, I believe two or three times and had the Iron Cross, which I\u2019ve been trying to locate and can\u2019t find. So that I would say they considered themselves primarily German and assimilated is the right word."

            "answer": "I think so, but I wouldn\u2019t know for sure. In Amsterdam I would say that was not necessarily the case. But I really don\u2019t remember, I remember only really family from Germany. I don\u2019t remember any children from school or acquaintances of my parents. For that matter I wouldn\u2019t know what their religion was. So, I really can\u2019t answer."
        },
        {
            "num": 14,
            "question": "And then another question from a different time. When you were living in Amsterdam, I believe you mentioned in the first interview that before your family was actually caught in a round-up and deported to Westerbork, you had been caught in another round-up and somehow managed to get out. Now that wasn\u2019t clear to me from the first interview what had happened during that time.",
            "answer": "I don\u2019t remember whether I was picked up at home or off the street and taken to a collection point where we were supposed to have been deported somewhere. And I walked away from it, and wasn\u2019t challenged in the process and got back home."

            "num": 16,
            "question": "And what happened the second time when your whole family was deported?",
            "answer": "The second time they, as they always did, they came in the middle of the night and you had five minutes to get dressed and get your, your bags were always packed because you knew it could happen. And you were hauled off in a truck along with other people, taken to the railroad station. Put on a train not knowing where to. And then I went to Westerbork, which was the transit camp that the Germans had established; it\u2019s in the eastern part of Holland near Zwolle. And we were held there for about six months. I don\u2019t think there were any other deportations. There may have been one or two trains before we were hauled out. And I think the general impression was that they were going to go to Theresienstadt. Why I don\u2019t know. But... never heard of Belsen before. As a matter of fact, we were one of the earliest ones in there. Belsen was... I\u2019m not sure if it was on a previous tape or not. When we got there, of course it was a very large facility. Part of it was a Russian POW camp. But obviously designed for officers, because they had little cabins and gravel walks between them and that sort of thing. And then there were two sections to the non-POW prisoners. One was for, called criminals and the second section was for the Jews. And as they started to fill up the Jewish section there were a number of trainfuls of Jews from Holland, a lot of Hungarians, French women. They were the wives of officers who were POW\u2019s from the French Army. And then after the, in \u201844, after the invasion of Italy, a lot of Libyan Jews that Rommel had shipped off to Italy and they had been held in camps in Italy and apparently under Red Cross supervision. They all had British uniforms and heavy British, woolen coats and the like, and lots of good food."

            "answer": "No, never heard of Westerbork. And of course, you know, it\u2019s maybe a two hour train ride at most. No, never heard of it before, at least I hadn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know whether my parents ever had. No idea."

            "answer": "No, no. They always said we\u2019d be relocating in a work camp or whatever. Or vague promises of exchanging for money, that relatives, particularly in America could buy you and so forth. But no, nobody had any inkling of what lay ahead in terms of the violence."

            "answer": "I would say so. The problem that I had were primarily with the right knee and I still have some problems with that knee. But I was spared the recurrence that apparently happened to older people when it was discovered in the last ten or 15 years or so. It must have been a fairly mild case even though polio, of course back then was rampant."

            "answer": "Yeah, I think so. I don\u2019t think anybody formed any bonds at all. It was a matter of survival and I don\u2019t mean to imply that you tried it at the expense of somebody else. But once we realized, I\u2019m not sure we really realized, but when it became a matter of trying to survive, you didn\u2019t and a fellow that was in the bunk either with you or next to you may not wake up in the morning. Nobody really tried to get attached to anybody else. You didn\u2019t form any bonds other than to, you didn\u2019t try to antagonize anybody, but there wasn\u2019t any real friendships or relationships of any kind. Well, there really wasn\u2019t much time either."

            "answer": "No, it was, that was, 1n a way the tragedy was that it was a gradual tightening of the noose, so to speak, in that... I remember the first two days in Belsen, there was so much food we couldn\u2019t eat it. There was no nutrition, but a liter of soup, even if 1t was only a liter of warm water with nothing in it. You\u2019re not used to drinking a liter of volume, a quart. It took two days and you ate it all and were hungry. And then the amount of food that you got kept getting less and less. And initially there were, the guards kept changing constantly and surprisingly they kept getting more and more vicious rather than less so. The last group which maybe was there for a year, year and a half, I don\u2019t recall for sure for how long, were World War One veterans who were too old or too feeble or had been wounded. But they were not suitable for frontline service in the German Army. And you would think that they would be not so hateful. And they weren\u2019t maybe the first 4 week, but they got there very quickly, got to be pretty vicious. And I\u2019m not sure whether they were told to or it was a natural progression as the sensitivities wore off."

And I\u2019m sure that others would have remembered something totally different that I don\u2019t even remember happening. Like that Easter Sunday, the fighter attack. Well, because of it, one of the barracks that got shot up was the warehouse. And one thing the Germans had were cans of beef in its own juice. And apparently some of those got bullet-riddled so they had to use them right away. For a couple of days we actually got food, but then they made up for it for a long time with nothing, because the food was gone again."

            "question": "Do you remember the day that you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen? Anything about that?",
            "answer": "No, nothing 1n particular. They, I guess in the afternoon the train was pushed into, the empty train was pushed into the compound. It was passenger cars. Then they posted names, they called them out and you had to be there whenever, an hour or so later. Got on the train, nobody knew where it was going to go. Supposedly it was just a relocation and they always promised you something better. Of course it never was. But particularly initially you didn\u2019t know. And I guess they had to, that I\u2019m sure explains why there was no really massive resistance. If you knew you were going to go to the gas chamber you may as well try and fight it. So you get shot on the spot. I think that\u2019s why there\u2019s, the general docility of the deportees."

And I wondered if in the long term you feel that having been there 5 early on enabled you to, or was an advantage as far as... you did mention that it was an advantage as far as food. But I wondered if your resistance was stronger and if you knew the system better?",
            "answer": "Well system, there was really no system. But yeah, I think so, because the people who came very late, particularly if they did not come from another camp but straight from home so to speak. They were plunged from a normal diet to 200, 300, whatever it was, calories a day. And I think they died faster than those of us who, even though they may have had physical, physically more reserves than we did, who our reserves were spent. But we may have been a little bit more cautious. And also we were so disease-ridden and I don\u2019t know whether our immune systems had strengthened. Those are medical issues that I don\u2019t know about. People who were plunged into this diarrhea, flea, lice, you know all the vermin. They could not tolerate it as much as those of us who were exposed to it more slowly."

At night the men and the women were separated, but during the day they could mingle freely if you were there. We all were in work details. My mother worked in the, what do you call it? Hospital, there was no hospital, so the infirmary. So, she physically stayed inside the camp. My dad worked, I think he worked the whole time on the shoe disassembly detail. I was on it for a little while before they shipped me outside to work details outside. My brother was working outside the camp too, I think. But I don\u2019t remember where, what details he was assigned to."

            "question": "And what about, you mentioned having to steal food 1n order to survive. Was that something that the newer prisoners maybe wouldn\u2019t have known how to do or that you kind of eventually learned?",
            "answer": "Well (laughs)... no, I think everybody... you didn\u2019t steal from each other, generally. Even though it was a matter of survival. I mentioned the Libyans who came from Italy. They came with humongous quantities of food. And we had the opportunity to steal some of it. And we actually buried it between the tracks so we could bring it back slowly. The other thing is being on the outside you were, not always, but sometimes you were patted down, and so you couldn\u2019t have anything on your body that didn\u2019t belong to you. They must have had a bad storm some years prior to establishing the camp. Bergen-Belsen was inside a military training camp, similar to Fort Knox. A lot of trees had been, had fallen over in this storm or storms. And they had cut the trees and hauled them off, but there were the roots, you know, standing up. And for a number of months I worked in the woods digging up those tree stumps, which were then, were hauled into... once a week they came out with the horse-drawn wagons and we had to load those tree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were hauled in. There was another detail inside the camp that was chopping them up into firewood. That\u2019s the one I was assigned to the day of that air attack. There were blueberries growing in the woods and one, of course we ate as much as we could, but also we all had, like a bag that was tied to your belt inside your pants. So you could pick berries and bring them in for the family to eat. So there was that and then, of course, if we could we stole the food from the guards. [Laughing.] Boy, they\u2019d take a whipping. They 6 would get their food and most of the time if they didn\u2019t finish it, it just sat there. And if somebody, we got a chance, we would try and get those cans and eat it. But apparently one day we ate them before they had eaten and so we got a pretty good whipping for that. It was probably worth it. It was good food. They didn\u2019t eat too bad. They got pretty decent food."

I wouldn\u2019t want to call him humane, but had a better sense of humor. And some individual guards were exceedingly cruel and would use any excuse to either kick you or club you with a rifle or shoot you, shoot at you. There was one incident that I recall where one of the guards was giving one of the men, this was in the woods, gave him hell. And he responded in Dutch, \u201cMan, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d And it turned out to be a Dutchman, the SS guy was a Dutchman, and boy did he beat the living daylights out of him, out of the prisoner. And then when we came back that evening, the sergeant was there and he, we all had to stand at attention. And he demanded to know if anything had happened and this turkey said, \u201cYes sergeant, this man said I\u2019m crazy.\u201d The sergeant said, \u201cThat man was right, detail dismissed.\u201d We got sent on. But it varied. Some of them would turn their back and just did their job. But they constantly changed. You never knew. You never spoke to any of them. Some of them would drop a cigarette butt and walk away. Others would drop the cigarette butt and wait for you to, try to pick it up and then step on your fingers. You never knew."

            "answer": "Yeah, later on they brought in women from Auschwitz. And I have to back up here a minute. There was an area where they had a huge circus tent, was set up. That\u2019s where they had the shoes. Apparently, I don\u2019t know over how long or what, the Germans had collected shoes for recycling or for donations or whatever the reason they gave to collect them. And then also there were a lot of military boots in there since many of them had bullet holes in them or shrapnel holes apparently from either wounded or dead soldiers. And what one of the big, quote, \u201cindustries\u201d was, was separating the upper leather from the soles and heels and then separate the leather from the rubber heels and/or soles. And that was done in that big tent. And then there was a... the leather soles, I guess, was what they couldn\u2019t reuse. And so they were stacked up in a humongous pile that was on the main drag and kept getting higher and higher. People, that was my first assignment was working on that. You had a wheelbarrow hauling those, and then you had to stack them so the whole thing wouldn\u2019t just fall over. And they emptied that, emptied that tent of all the shoes, and they started to bring in women and they established a separate woman\u2019s camp. And it turned out that one of the first groups in there included the wife, who had been with us, of a fellow. She had worked in the kitchen and she got caught taking some food to try to give to her husband. And first they shipped her to, I guess to Luneburg, to jail. And she was there in jail for a while and the police apparently were trying to protect her from the Gestapo, but couldn\u2019t. And ultimately she was shipped to Auschwitz. But the police had warned her about Auschwitz and so as she arrived she managed to walk from the incoming group to an outgoing group which happened to come to Belsen. And so she was back and she was in that group. And she went to the fence and hollered at somebody to tell her husband that she was back by way of Auschwitz. That\u2019s how we knew that group had come from Auschwitz. You could talk to them usually across the fence as long as you didn\u2019t get too close to the fence."

            "answer": "No. Initially we woke up because of... we were on the train still and the train was stopped. And all kinds of noises, and here were the Russian Cossacks just the way they were pictured, you know, in their furs and horseback and rifles slung over their shoulders. And we had learned, like you said, the one word in Russian, chleb (ph), which is bread. And they let us off, and so we went on into town. Then there must have been some discussion about where to go and whoever, they told us just to go and if you need to, throw the Germans out. And we happened to go into a fairly large house along with some others, who... the woman claimed they were in the Nazis, but her husband was a minister. And he sure was in the SS. And so we didn\u2019t have any compunction about bullying them. Somebody, apparently there must have been some people who spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian. I remember somebody said something about food, and so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun and shot a cow and said help yourself. One of the French women recognized the opportunity and went with the frontline unit. And of course, that morning crossed the Elbe River into the American part of Germany and managed to get back to Paris, which of course had been liberated the year before. And put an ad in the Paris paper, those who were looking for their wives, and I don\u2019t know whether she mentioned names or it was a specific group. And they responded. Many of them were of course in the French Army. And so they got the American Army to send two of those two and a half ton trucks over to come and get them. And of course, everybody wanted to go. And they promised they\u2019d be back and they did. I guess in the euphoria, you know, the war was over by that time. I think we were in Tribitz (ph) for about six weeks. All of the people that were still alive from that train, there were about a thousand of them, were evacuated by the Americans and taken to Leipzig, where they had a DP camp. And the Russians let the trucks come in and get them."

I\u2019m not sure I got cans or an open bucket of condensed milk, you know, had a lot of sugar in it. And we just couldn\u2019t eat it, not for a while.

I\u2019m digressing, but I didn\u2019t know anybody on that train. I had never run into anybody who was, for that matter, never ran into anybody who was at Belsen. And I guess it\u2019s three years ago now. We were, we took a trip, first grand circle tour we ever took. It was a river cruise from Vienna to Amsterdam. It was the first time that I was back in Germany and I wasn\u2019t sure whether I could tolerate it or not. We decided on this trip because I could just stay on the boat. Didn\u2019t have to go on land where I would have to be in contact with any Germans. But one night we\u2019re having dinner with two ladies. One of whom, very interesting woman\u2014she was the one who introduced the Lamaze method to the United States\u2014 and her cousin. And somehow the other woman was telling us that her daughter was taking her daughter, the woman\u2019s grandchild, to Europe, Amsterdam. They had discussed Anne Frank in class and she wanted to see the Anne Frank house. And she said, \u201cI told my daughter there\u2019s always long lines at the Anne Frank house and if you can\u2019t get in, go next door, that\u2019s where your father was hidden during the war.\u201d And I said to her, \u201cOh, were you in Amsterdam during the war?\u201d And she said yes she was, but her two sisters both got found out. They all had gone into hiding. And they ended up in Belsen. I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s where I was. I never met anybody from Belsen.\u201d I said, \u201cAre they still alive?\u201d And she said yeah, the one sister was. But the other sister and her husband died after they were liberated. They were hauled by train. \u201cOh,\u201d I said, \u201cto Tribitz?\u201d And she said \u201cYes, how do you know?\u201d And I said, \u201cI was on that train also.\u201d And so that\u2019s as close as I ever came to meeting anybody or knowing anybody. But the irony, irony, small world: the sister who was still alive lived next door to my mother\u2019s closest friend in New York. So you never know. But no, I didn\u2019t know anybody and outside of that incident I have never talked to anybody who was there. As a matter of fact, my brother is very active. He\u2019s on the Board of Directors of the Anne Frank house. And I happened to be talking to him about a year or so ago and he told me, and I didn\u2019t realize, I went to school with Anne Frank. I was in the same class, but I don\u2019t remember her at all. And I got to wondering if there is a class 11 picture that exists. I\u2019ll have to ask him of the grade school. Because we both should be in it. Just curious."

Matter of fact, very grateful about many things. De-lousing with DDT. They sprayed us from head to toe with DDT. Think how environmentally unacceptable that is today. And I\u2019m still alive in spite of it. But it got rid of the fleas and in particular the lice which was so important. But we could come and go as we pleased. And I don\u2019t remember it was with my brother or some other boys, anyway, young men, we would get on the trolley and the conductor trying to collect money from us and we told him what he could do, or what we would do. We were pretty nasty. So they left us pretty much alone. And then we weren\u2019t there all that long. And then when they were told, they\u2019re going to take us back to Holland, it was on a Red Cross train. We wouldn\u2019t go onto the beds because they were absolutely starched, bleached, perfectly white sheets. And here we were, in spite of getting regular baths, pretty filthy. We only had one set of clothes and shoes. I\u2019m sure we had shoes. I had a woman\u2019s blouse, because I remember it, Army blouse, because it buttoned the wrong way. But they weren\u2019t even able to fit, not small enough. They insisted we get in the beds and don\u2019t worry about getting them dirty. And then they brought us bread that was as white as the sheets were. Couldn\u2019t believe that. But anyway they took us back to Holland and they put us in a convent in southern Holland, where the Dutch then sorted things out. And you had to have a place to stay before they\u2019d send you back to Amsterdam. And that was taken care of."

His closest friend was an American. His father was the distributor for Holland and Belgium of RKO, the movies. And I think he stayed with them. And my parents stayed with, I don\u2019t even remember who it was. Somebody. So we were in different locations. We weren\u2019t really, and this was like, talking the summer of \u201845. There really wasn\u2019t much going on. Trying to see about getting back into school. My high school class had graduated. I think we may have actually been back in Amsterdam when the graduation was, but of course they wouldn\u2019t give me my diploma. Hadn\u2019t been there in four years. Four out of six wasn\u2019t good enough. And so my mother was making arrangements to see what the school about me trying out, well both of us, trying to get back into school in the Fall. What the requirements would be, and trying to line up a tutor and a place to live. And I think, somebody... the Dutch did things fairly reasonably. The person that was living in our house had gotten there in good faith. He did not know, or they did not know that was the property or the residence of deported Jews. And so what they did, if the person had something in good faith, so you don\u2019t have, just transfer the victim from one person to another. They could stay there. So my parents found a place to live. And I don\u2019t know where the furniture came from, whether that was, whether those were donations or purchases or whether they had given some of that furniture to somebody to hide. But anyway we ultimately had an apartment where we lived. And then school started pretty soon. We had a tutor trying to get us up to speed, because I was allowed into the senior class on the condition that if I didn\u2019t measure up, that the school would have the right not to let me take the comprehensive exams at the end of the year. Well that\u2019s the deal they made with my parents, obviously. Apparently I did all right because... and I do remember having to go to a couple of teachers after classes for additional instruction. It\u2019s kind of tough to pick up solid geometry if you haven\u2019t had trigonometry. So, trying to catch up."

You spent every night doing homework, and 13 we went to school on Saturdays half a day. And so maybe we were allowed to go and play for ten minutes before dinner.

With the work that your brother... (Rosenberg bursts out laughing) ...it\u2019s a strange way of putting the question, isn\u2019t it?",
            "answer": "No, I tell you reason I am laughing 1s I suppose if you look for sympathy it would be. But no, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never found any benefit to either, occasionally if I get pushed I will mention it. I normally don\u2019t as a matter of conversation. We were in Spain and there was a couple in that group that we were with, who were Germans, who had retired. He had worked for General Motors and they lived in Windsor, across in Canada. And they had invited a friend of theirs from Germany to come down and join us. We were on the trip up to Granada to see the Alhambra. And on the way back we were sitting at a table and this man came wandering in by himself. I said to him in German, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d He complained, \u201cNot very well.\u201d He didn\u2019t speak English, and so unless his friends were around... blah, blah, blah. And then on a stop on the way back, we were standing in line together and he said, \u201cHow come you speak German so well?\u201d And I was debating what to say. I just said, \u201cI was in a concentration camp.\u201d And I totally devastated that man. And that evening he sought me out in the bar and came to apologize. I said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s not your fault, you were too young.\u201d This man was in his fifties, he may have been a child at the time. \u201cOh, please come to Germany,\u201d he would host us, et cetera, et cetera. So I\u2019m always very careful because there\u2019s no need to upset people that have no, you know, no responsibility. I\u2019m not looking for an advantage. So no, I rarely volunteer the information."

And that those many of us who survived are perfectly normal people. Or what passes for normal, at least I think so. (Laughing.) And don\u2019t all go around looking, \u201cHey, you owe me a favor because I survived.\u201d But it\u2019s not a bias free society. Until whatever it is, say five years ago... I\u2019ve been wanting to go and visit my grandparent\u2019s grave. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself the thought of going to Germany. One, because it\u2019s Germany; and two, that I wasn\u2019t sure whether I could control my temper if somebody were to say something to me that would set me off. And so we decided on a trial and that was we went to Switzerland for a week with day trips out of Lucerne. And the first trip was to the Black Forest. You get out of it for lunch and you get back on the bus. The bus was the safe haven. And then another day for a couple of hours. And it went all right. I didn\u2019t feel particularly bad or tense. But on that boat trip, after Cologne it got to me suddenly, and I had to get out of there. And I actually during dinner, got up, went up on top of the boat, on the top deck, to make sure we passed that border back into Holland. Because I just got obsessed all of a sudden, panicky. And haven\u2019t been back since. 16"

This fellow got to Belsen the day before the liberation or two days before the liberation. The Swedes took him out, sent him to Sweden. He was in a Swedish hospital for a year. But he decided to use that year to write down everything he could remember. And then spend the rest of his life filling in the details that he didn\u2019t remember, and try and get the... and he wrote a book. The original was published in German and just before he died, supposedly it was published, finally got published in English. And I never did get a copy of it. I'll have to ask my cousin for it. But I got a copy of his tape. But he remembers names and dates and... and he went from one labor camp to another labor camp, and the name of the commander of the camp and all that kind of stuff that I have no idea about and really, don\u2019t really care. And yeah, my kids know, but they also really have no relation to it. My youngest daughter couldn\u2019t, when I said something to her about the Vietnam War, she says, \u201cBut Dad I was only six then.\u201d You know, so it\u2019s all ancient history. Just like World War One is ancient history to me. I know about it. I\u2019m a bit of a history buff and I wanted to see the Bosporus. That\u2019s a World War One site. The British took one hell of a beating there. That was Churchill\u2019s doing. And went to Yalta, wanted to see that. But no, they\u2019re not really interested."

And we had to work half day Saturdays. And then we took, had to take... we didn\u2019t have to, we took turns taking calls on the weekends. That paid an extra six dollars. And the girls all were more interested in going to the beach, so I took all of their calls, because I needed the six dollars more than I needed a suntan. And then I got a ticket. Two weeks in this country and I got a ticket. That was Saturday morning, going to work, I was going down the subway and a cop stopped me. I didn\u2019t know what he wanted. I didn\u2019t understand enough of what he was saying. And so I pulled my passport out and I opened it on the immigration stamp to show him I don\u2019t, you know it was two weeks. I did understand what identification was. And so he proceeded to write and tore this thing out, gave me my passport back and tore this thing out and told me it was a ticket. Well the only meaning of the word ticket I knew was admission to a theater. Didn\u2019t want to, don\u2019t have time to go. Tried to explain... finally made me take it, he told me I didn\u2019t have to go myself, I could give it to somebody else. When I got to work I tried to tell the fellow I work with, I asked him if he wanted the ticket. He said what for? (Laughing.) I told him I didn\u2019t know, but a cop had given it to me. So he explained to me that I had gotten a ticket for whatever, well, it was June and first of July was the end of the fiscal year and he had to make his quota, so he was writing tickets furiously and I guess I looked like a good sucker for one. And when I became a citizen you have to list all non- moving traffic violations excepted. So I went back to court to find out what the heck I had done. Whatever it was, violation of city code something or other, disposition, two dollars. Fine of two dollars, that was it. But it\u2019s on my records."

And the State Department was so strongly anti- Semitic, they saw it as their function to keep as many Jews out as they could, not to try and rescue as many and let them in. And the Immigration Service didn\u2019t help matters either. An uncle of mine when he went for his hearing was asked for his convictions. He said he didn\u2019t have any. The judge says, \u201cThink it over and come back in six months.\u201d This went on twice. You know, what the hell are you talking about?

You had to be a resident for five years. You had to demonstrate your fluency in English, not like today where they\u2019 Il give it to you in Spanish or French or whatever. And lastly you had to demonstrate a knowledge of American history. And the Daughters of the American Revolution used to give courses in American history for foreigners. Who was the 23\" president? They asked my dad to name the 13 original colonies. And he got as far as one or two, I remember, and the judge said, \u201cGuess I asked the wrong person, you tell me.\u201d Well, I started out with Georgia going up the coast, because I could never remember whether it\u2019s Maine or New Hampshire. (Laughing.) And he stopped me when I got to Vermont. So I got off easy. I got at least 12 of the 13. And he asked me, I still don\u2019t know why that was the wrong answer, he asked me, \u201cWhy do we celebrate the Fourth of July?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s Independence Day.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the right answer. I\u2019m not sure what it was supposed to be. But they were pretty strict and... depending on the judge, most of those were not all that bad. But there was... well Dupont did not hire its first Jew until World War Two. And when I graduated from college in \u201854, Armstrong-Quartz (ph) still didn\u2019t hire Jews.

Of the remaining eleven, three brothers were here and four sisters. And the one brother was picked up during the Kristallnacht thing in \u201838 and taken to Dachau. And then was released because he had pneumonia, so he wouldn\u2019t die in a concentration camp, so they could count him as having released him, rather than having him die there. And he died at home. And they decided they better get their son out before he\u2019s going to get it too. But my mother\u2019s sister-in-law with her daughter stayed and they perished. And another sister and her husband had moved to Belgium in the early \u201830s. He was a very prosperous furniture manufacturer. They had two daughters. And they actually helped one of the other sisters\u2019 children, they managed to get out, I guess, as late as \u00b042, by way of Belgium and through Portugal. They stayed for a while with them. But that couple with their children, the sister, they perished. As a matter of fact, I had documentation of them at one time, their death certificates. And then on my father\u2019s side, my grandmother, my dad\u2019s mother, lived in Amsterdam also. And she had cardiac problems so bad, she couldn\u2019t have walked from here to the front door without taking nitroglycerine, but she survived the cattle car ride to the gas chambers and died at Auschwitz. And one of, his sister was here, but his brother was still in Germany and he perished. And so no, we, and fortunately for my mother\u2019s, my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, she died in late \u201844, so she never did find out what happened to her children, those that were in Europe. But no, that was a common topic of conversation in the family. My... the son that was sent over, he went back to his hometown looking for his parents or for his mother and sister. He was in the Army. Some of my other cousins that were in the Army went looking for the relatives and for us. Of course once we got back to Holland, my parents, my mother contacted her sisters, and let them know that we had survived. Of course, they also asked to see if we could find out from there what happened to the other relatives. And there\u2019s the extended family as I mentioned, my dad\u2019s cousin, his parents did not survive. 25"

He said, \u201cI\u2019m Peter Robertson, your brother.\u201d (Laughing.) He had been sent out and was drafted in the British Army and they wouldn\u2019t allow the name Rosenberg.

And he went in and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my carpet.\u201d Fellow says, \u201cTough luck, it cost you so much,\u201d whatever it was. He took a picture of it, but 1t didn\u2019t do any good, because as I said earlier, the Dutch didn\u2019t want to transfer the victim from one to another. But they ended up buying it again. And then I got it after my mother died. There are other things that come up occasionally or would come up about something that was missing, or wondering where it was. I had a fairly nice stamp collection that I had given to a friend for safekeeping. And all the valuable stamps are gone. You know, you can be harsh about it, saying they stole from you, on the other hand, they may have traded it for food and needed it. They didn\u2019t know whether you were going to come back or not. The only one that was absolutely and scrupulously honest was the concierge of the business where my dad worked. He had everything that my dad entrusted to him and gave every bit of it back. Where many of your so-called friends denied they ever had anything. And there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s unfortunate and I didn\u2019t know about it until fairly recently. Apparently my mother had written a long letter to one of her sisters, or maybe to all of them, same letter addressed to all of them, about the deprivation, et cetera, et cetera. She said her ambition was to die in her own bed between clean sheets. And that letter wasn\u2019t discovered until one of my cousins, one of the sister\u2019s daughters, who lived on Long Island, but was moving to Florida and was going through the stuff to throw things away and came across that letter and gave it to... I think there may be one or two pages missing. But it was not until a year or so, two years after my mother had died. And that explained a lot of things to us. But fortunately we 26 were able to do that unknowingly. She died at home in her own bed. It was difficult to do it that way, but..."

It was nerve-racking, because I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, it was ACE, the Atomic Energy Commission was the primary contractor. And so it was at the whims of the government. And two years after I was up there we went overnight from three thousand to three hundred employees. Fortunately I was one of the three hundred that they kept.

And I always like to travel, but of course, with a family and work that isn\u2019t always possible. So we made up for it since I retired. And I enjoy history, learning about it, learned more about it since I retired, I guess. Now I have time to watch television and the History channel and A&E and of course, KET to some extent. So that... a lot more exposure and therefore an ability to learn a lot more. And then too, when we travel, we do it with the intent, not always the same. I don\u2019t go for these Caribbean cruises, you know, \u201cShow me, feed me, entertain me.\u201d I like cruises because they are a lazy man\u2019s way of traveling\u2014you only pack and unpack once\u2014but there has to be a reason for it. And sometimes they are real eye-openers. A couple of years we went on an Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea cruise and we were in Constanta, Romania, which is the major port of Romania on the Black Sea. Ovid was exiled there for seven years or whatever. Well, never even thought that the Romans as well as the Greeks, both came up the west coast of the Black Sea, east coast of the Balkan Peninsula. And that they had gone that far North into what is now Odessa and to the Crimea. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s of no importance right now, but in terms of historical event, just didn\u2019t think about that or heard about it. A lot of things like that. But as we talked earlier about the famine, and what complicity the British had. The other day there was a fascinating program on the Vikings. They were the kings of Kiev in Russia. They went east. Nobody... I never heard that before."

            "question": "What about Holocaust-era history? Have you done much reading about that or taken an interest in finding out what happened on a broader scale?",
            "answer": "Oh yes, yes, definitely. As you know there are a lot of programs, bits and pieces. There is a lot... new things, but also things that are being, I think, being hidden from view that never show again. The... well of course, in addition to Spielberg\u2019s movie, I\u2019m not sure what the show was the other day, but there are a number of programs that deal with the Holocaust or deal with certain aspects of the Holocaust. Or for that matter, not necessarily in that context, but primarily in the context of Nazis or Hitlerism and their henchmen and how they got involved and what they did. And the Holocaust in the broadest sense, in terms of the enslaving of particularly the Slavs, the eastern Europeans and the murder, genocide of them, not necessarily just the Jews. But then one thing, and I have a video of it, it was on PBS maybe twenty-five years ago, about 31 Fort Ticonderoga, and I have never seen it again. I mentioned to you earlier the anti-Semitism of the State Department. In 1943, when the Holocaust became pretty well-known in government circles, but was being hidden from the American population, a number of Henry Morgenthau\u2019s employees went to him and said, \u201cYou go to FDR and tell him he does something or else we\u2019re going to go public that the U.S. government knows about this and isn\u2019t doing anything.\u201d And as a consequence of that, they brought some six, 800, what was then called DPs, displaced persons, to this country. They had to sign a statement, which of course anybody in his right mind would have, that after the war they would go back to their country of origin. And they put them into Fort Ticonderoga. And after the war was over with, they tried to ship them back. Well, you know, you signed this thing. But a number of couples had had children here. They were born at Fort Ticonderoga and therefore they were native-born citizens, and therefore their parents were entitled to stay here as the parents of minor American citizens. The State Department declared Fort Ticonderoga was not American soil and therefore they were not American citizens. Can you imagine a place that is so historically important in the American Revolution being declared not being a part of America? I mean that\u2019s the kind of convoluting, convolutions, unfortunately, our government went through. As I said, that was a PBS show, 25 years ago, I have never seen it again. I guess too many toes were being stepped on. But... and of course, I went to the Holocaust museum, but I couldn\u2019t take it, make it past the Saint Louis, because I remember that one vividly. Another black mark in our history."

It\u2019s incredible that the things that the U.S. government could have done, should have done and never did do. It\u2019s that kind of malfeasance that really upset me, particularly in that context."

            "num": 140,
            "question": "Related to that, I\u2019m interested in something you said in your last interview, which was a piece of advice that you were giving to other Holocaust survivors. That many have met with very good fortune in their post-war lives and that they ought to do what they can to give something back to the community. And so on the one hand you have that compulsion or that desire and on the other hand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings of this government and the ways that they have, have really not served the... and in particular in the couple of instances you just brought up, Holocaust survivors. How do you reconcile those two?",
            "answer": "Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separate issues. Maybe they are related, and that is by giving back to the community, by helping people that are in need of help. Maybe because the government should and isn\u2019t, that you\u2019re overcoming the shortcomings of our government. Even though I don\u2019t take that into consideration. There are two ways that one can give back, one is financially and that\u2019s the easy way out that most of us take, is to make contributions to a variety of charitable organizations, or non-profit organizations. But then the more important one is to give of your time and help people. I\u2019m sure the same thing holds true for Lexington, in Louisville there is a shortage, an incredible shortage of volunteers. And all of us retirees who have spare time, and we should have spare time, should donate some of that time to some of these organizations. Whether it\u2019s Dare to Care to sort out cans of food, or work at the Wayside Christian Mission as an example, any of these shelters, and dish out food for people in need. Or 32 I work in the tax program, in fact I have somebody come in who needs help with their taxes. One of the great organizations in general of a variety of needs is Catholic Charities. And they\u2019re desperate for volunteers. Obviously: they asked me to help. (Laughing.) And I have. But the thing 1s, that is one way that you can give back. And whether it\u2019s in your own expertise or if it\u2019s just plain labor. Some people are unwilling to become raw labor, drive for Meals on Wheels or drive for Dare to Care and pick up bread at Kroger or whatever. But that\u2019s the kind of jobs that need to be done. And that\u2019s the kind of things that makes many of these non-profit organizations click. Newt Gingrich, who is so maligned, some four or five years ago, for his reasons felt that the public radio should no longer be funded by the U.S. government. And I completely agree with him. But that doesn\u2019t mean that today they give them big hunk of money and tomorrow it\u2019s zilch. Cut it back. I work for the public radio stations here as a volunteer. And they used that withdrawal of government funds to encourage the public to contribute and they did tremendous, the biggest drive they ever had. And rightly so. I\u2019m a firm believer in putting the public back into public radio and public television, but it requires a commitment on the part of the people to make financial donations. And that\u2019s just one, that\u2019s not nearly as, I suppose, important as helping somebody who\u2019s hungry or reading for the blind, but it\u2019s one of the large variety of volunteer jobs that needs to be done. It\u2019s amazing, I don\u2019t do that much. I\u2019m not trying to pat myself on the back. But one of the people that used to work for me professionally now actually works for me in a volunteer, one of his volunteer activities, got the GE volunteer award of the year, he and his wife, jointly, this past year. Between the two of them they put in three thousand hours a year, that\u2019s a hell of a lot of hours. That\u2019s almost a fulltime job. If we could get half the people to do half that or for that matter, ten percent of the people to do ten percent of that, it would be a lot of help. And that\u2019s what I mean by that."

            "answer": "Oh yes, well, no I think or it appears at least that more recently that the antagonism toward Louisville, Louisville versus the rest of Kentucky, seems to be diminishing. But that is, you know the large city versus the rest of the state. Look at New York and New York City, Georgia and Atlanta and you know, you can go on. I think it\u2019s probably true of most states that the large cities are thought to be representative and they\u2019re not. Even though they contain most of the population. And I can understand that. And the interests of Kentucky in particularly are so diverse, from Appalachia with its problems, and Western Kentucky with some of the same problems and some totally different problems. And Louisville, of course, for painfully obvious reasons having totally different problems that people in Appalachia couldn\u2019t care less about. But that\u2019s true everywhere. And it\u2019s amazing, the thing that I thought that the United States was unique, unfortunately, in its race relations problems. They\u2019re not. It\u2019s the same everywhere. It doesn\u2019t matter what country you go to, it may not be like we have, black and white. But we were in New Zealand and there was a big ruckus and the Royal Commission on Race Relations or whatever it was, got involved, refused to get involved in it. Well, the mere fact that they have a 33 Royal Commission on Race Relations says there\u2019s a problem there. And it\u2019s the Maoris, which are no longer in existence. The purest Maori is one-eighth Maori and seven-eighths white. And in Australia it\u2019s the indigenous people versus the settlers. And then of course among the settlers you get the same ethnic divisions that you get everywhere else. Look right now, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, the whole world is erupting in ethnic and race problems. Africa is just a terrible situation."

            "answer": "No, not really. I read about it and I heard about it and was only peripherally affected by it. But in the early fifties, while I was in Durham, the mayor of Durham was Jewish. Why I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a fairly good sized, there was a\u2014there may still be\u2014a good-sized Jewish community in Durham because of the tobacco industry. Apparently they brought the Jews down in order to make cigars, like they did in Tampa with the Cubans. And then, I still remember the man\u2019s name, Bishop Waters was the Catholic Bishop for North Carolina. The little town of Washington, North Carolina was two parishes, a black and a white. Neither one of them could support a priest, and he ordered them integrated. Boy was there ever a stink, but it worked. Wasn\u2019t... no more than two months and they essentially had ninety percent attendance of the two parishes in one church building. It was unheard of. Of course the press would claim race relations are only bad in the South. Well, they\u2019re probably a lot better in the South than they were elsewhere. But yeah, I certainly was keenly aware of it, and cautious. Before I bought a house in Houston, this was in the late fifties, I consulted with a local friend to say \u201cHey, so that I don\u2019t stub my toe, 1s there anyplace that I cannot go? Where I would be refused because I am Jewish?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes. Don\u2019t go to Oak Forest,\u201d or Forest Oaks, whatever it was called, which I couldn\u2019t anyway, that was the rich neighborhood. But you learned to do those things."

I have two or three acquaintances who are retired, who went back to work on a part-time basis, because they don\u2019t know what to do with themselves. They\u2019re bored. This is utterly ridiculous. And I keep trying to get them enrolled in some activity and they just won\u2019t do it. But there\u2019s just too many people that need help, who cannot help themselves. And throwing money at the problem is not necessarily the solution. It isn\u2019t that it can\u2019t be done without money, but it\u2019s the personal help that\u2019s required. And here in Louisville, we are blessed with a number of things. We have here three groups that make recordings for the blind. The Recordings for the Blind, the Audio Studio, and there\u2019s a third one. There isn\u2019t another city in this country that does that. We have three public radio stations. There is not, even New York only has one. There are 34 a lot of things that are good things, matter of fact I don\u2019t brag about Louisville, keep down the population influx. (Laughing.) Selfish."

It\u2019s up for voting on election day, you can bet money on it, it won\u2019t happen. The race relations right now are just so terrible. All you have to do is look at other communities and other cities and that\u2019s not just... take this house here as an example, which you can buy similar house here for depending on the condition and age, but let\u2019s say 150 to 250. Go to Silicon Valley you couldn\u2019t touch it for two and a half million dollars. In other areas, yeah you may be able to get for less, but most areas you can\u2019t touch it for twice the amount of money. Matter of fact, most retirees moving out of California, sell their houses and live happily ever after, because they can buy another house somewhere else in Arizona or in Florida for a fraction of what it\u2019s worth in California. Our food prices are reasonable, with the exception of gasoline in Jefferson County. I went to Shelbyville last night and paid 40 cents a gallon less than what it is in Louisville. I mean that\u2019s ridiculous. Could have gone as far as Simpsonville, that\u2019s only ten miles, 25 cents a gallon. But outside of these temporary distortions, Louisville has grown up a lot in the last 15, 20 years. I used to get all my bread from Chicago, now there\u2019s a grocery store over on Taylorsville Road that carries it and I can go get it there. We used to go to Cincinnati to get a three month supply of cold cuts, now I can buy almost all of it here. And so on and so forth. We\u2019re blessed here with, within two miles or three, excellent bakeries and different bakeries. If you want a certain thing you get it here. How many communities can you say that?
