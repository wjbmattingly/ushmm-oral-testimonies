And you were hauled off in a truck along with other people, taken to the railroad station. Put on a train not knowing where to. And then I went to Westerbork, which was the transit camp that the Germans had established; it \u2122s in the eastern part of Holland near Zwolle. And we were held there for about six months. I don\u2122t think there were any other deportations. There may have been one or two trains before we were hauled out. And I think the general impression was that they were going to go to Theresienstadt. Why I don\u2122t know. But\u2013 never heard of Belsen before. As a matte r of fact, we were one of the earliest ones in there. Belsen was\u2013 I\u2122m not sure if it was on a previous tape or not. When we got there, of course it was a very large facility. Part of it was a Russian POW camp. But obviously designed for officers, because they had little cabins and gravel walks be tween them and that sort of thing. And then there were two sections to the non-POW prisoners . One was for, called criminals and the second section was for the Jews. And as they started to fill up the Jewish section there were a number of trainfuls of Jews from Holland, a lot of Hungarians, French women. They were the wives of officers who were POW\u2122s from the French Army. And then after the, in \u201a44, after the invasion of Italy, a lot of Libyan Jews that Rommel had shipped off to Italy and they had been held in camps in Italy and apparently under Red Cross s upervision. They all had British uniforms and heavy British, woolen coats and the like, and lots of good food."

I mentioned the Libyans who came from Italy. They came with humongous quantities of food. And we had the opportunity to steal some of it. And we actually buried it between the tracks so we could bring it back slowly. The other thing is being on the outside you were, not always, but sometim es you were patted down, and so you couldn\u2122t have anything on your body that didn\u2122t belong to you. They must have had a bad storm some years prior to establishing the camp. Bergen-Bel sen was inside a military training camp, similar to Fort Knox. A lot of trees had been, had fallen over in this storm or storms. And they had cut the trees and hauled them off, but there were the roots, you know, standing up. And for a number of months I worked in the woods diggi ng up those tree stumps, which were then, were hauled into\u2013 once a week they came out with th e horse-drawn wagons and we had to load those tree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were hauled in. There was another detail inside the camp that was chopping them up into firewood. That\u2122s the one I was assigned to the day of that air attack. There were blueberries growing in the woods and one, of course we ate as much as we could, but also we all had, like a bag that was tied to your belt inside your pants. So you could pick berries and bring them in for the family to eat. So there was that and then, of course, if we could we stole the food from the guards. [Laughing.] Boy, they\u2122d take a whipping. They USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 7 7would get their food and most of the time if they didn\u2122t finish it, it just sat there. And if somebody, we got a chance, we would try and get t hose cans and eat it. But apparently one day we ate them before they had eaten and so we got a pretty good whipping for that. It was probably worth it. It was good food. They didn\u2122t eat too bad. They got pretty decent food."

That\u2122s where they had the shoes. Apparently, I don\u2122t know over how long or what, the Germans had collected shoes for recycling or for donations or whatever the reason they gave to collect them. And then also there were a lot of military boots in there since many of them had bullet holes in them or shrapnel holes apparently from either wounded or dead soldiers. And what one of the big, quote, \ufb01industries\ufb02 was, was separating the upper leather from the soles a nd heels and then separate the leather from the rubber heels and/or soles. And that was done in that big tent. And then there was a\u2013 the leather soles, I guess, was what they couldn\u2122t reuse. And so they were stacked up in a humongous pile that was on the main drag and kept getting higher and higher. People, that was my first assignment was working on that. You had a wheelbarrow hauling those, and then you had to stack them so the whole thing wouldn\u2122t just fall over. And they emptied that, emptied that tent of all the shoes, and they started to bring in women and they established a separate woman\u2122s camp. And it turned out that one of the first groups in there included the wife, who had been with us, of a fellow. She had worked in the kitchen and she got caught taking some food to try to give to her husband. And first they shipped her to, I guess to L\u00fcneburg, to jail. And she was there in jail for a while and the police apparently were trying to protect her from the Gestapo, but couldn\u2122t. And ultimately she was shipped to Au schwitz. But the police had warned her about Auschwitz and so as she arrived she managed to walk from the incoming group to an outgoing group which happened to come to Belsen.

And all kinds of noises, and here were the Russian Cossacks just the way they were pictured, you know, in their furs and horseback and rifles slung over their shoulders. And we had learned, like you said, the one word in Russian, chleb (ph) , which is bread. And they let us off, and so we went on into town. Then there must have been some discussion about wh ere to go and whoever, they told us just to go and if you need to, throw the Germans out. And we happened to go into a fairly large house along with some others, who\u2013 th e woman claimed they were in the Nazis, but her husband was a minister. And he sure wa s in the SS. And so we didn\u2122t have any compunction about bullying them. Somebody, appare ntly there must have been some people who spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian. I remember somebody said something about food, and so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun and shot a cow and said help yourself. One of the French women recognized the opportunity and went with the frontline unit. And of course, that morning crossed the Elbe River into the American part of Germany and managed to get back to Paris, which of course had been liberated the year before. And put an ad in the Paris paper, those who were looking for their wives, and I don\u2122t know whether she mentioned names or it wa s a specific group. And they responded. Many of them were of course in the French Army. And so they got the American Army to send two of those two and a half ton trucks over to come and get them. And of course, everybody wanted to go. And they promised they\u2122d be back and they did. I guess in the euphoria, you know, the war was over by that time. I think we were in Tribitz (ph) for about six weeks. All of the people that were still alive from that tr ain, there were about a thousand of them, were evacuated by the Americans and taken to Leipzig, where they had a DP camp. And the Russians let the trucks come in and get them."

Yeah, everybody\u2013 I\u2122m digressing, but I didn\u2122t know anybody on that train. I had never run into anybody who was, for that matter, never ran into anybody who was at Belsen. And I guess it\u2122s three years ago now. We were, we took a trip, first grand circle tour we ever took. It was a river cruise from Vienna to Amsterdam. It was the first time that I was back in Germany and I wasn\u2122t sure whether I could tolera te it or not. We decided on this trip because I could just stay on the boat. Didn\u2122t have to go on land where I would have to be in contact with any Germans. But one night we\u2122re having di nner with two ladies. One of whom, very interesting woman\u0160she was the one who introdu ced the Lamaze method to the United States\u0160 and her cousin. And somehow the other woman wa s telling us that her daughter was taking her daughter, the woman\u2122s grandchild, to Europe, Amsterdam. They had discussed Anne Frank in class and she wanted to see the Anne Frank house. And she said, \ufb01I told my daughter there\u2122s always long lines at the Anne Frank house and if you can\u2122t get in, go next door, that\u2122s where your father was hidden during the war.\ufb02 And I said to her, \ufb01Oh, were you in Amsterdam during the war?\ufb02 And she said yes she was, but her two sisters both got found out. They all had gone into hiding. And they ended up in Belsen. I said, \ufb01Oh, that\u2122s where I was. I never met anybody from Belsen.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Are they still alive?\ufb02 And she said yeah, th e one sister was. But the other sister and her husband died after they were liberated. They were hauled by train. \ufb01Oh,\ufb02 I said, \ufb01to Tribitz?\ufb02 And she said \ufb01Yes, how do you know?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01I was on that train also.\ufb02 And so that\u2122s as close as I ever came to meeting anybody or knowing anybody. But the irony, irony, small world: the sister who wa s still alive lived next door to my mother\u2122s closest friend in New York. So you never know. But no, I didn\u2122t know anybody and outside of that incident I have never talked to anybody who was there. As a matter of fact, my brot her is very active. He\u2122s on the Board of Directors of the Anne Frank house. And I happened to be talking to him about a year or so ago and he told me, and I didn\u2122t realize, I went to school with Anne Frank. I was in the same class, but I don\u2122t remember her at all. And I got to wondering if there is a class USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 12 12picture that exists. I\u2122ll have to ask him of the grade school. Because we both should be in it. Just curious."

We were pretty nasty. So they left us pretty much alone. And then we weren\u2122t there all that long. And then when they were told, they\u2122re going to take us back to Holland, it was on a Red Cross trai n. We wouldn\u2122t go onto the beds because they were absolutely starched, bleached, perfectly white sheets. And here we were, in spite of getting regular baths, pretty filthy. We only had one set of clothes and shoes. I\u2122m sure we had shoes. I had a woman\u2122s blouse, because I remember it, Army blouse, because it buttoned the wrong way. But they weren\u2122t even able to fit, not small enough. They insist ed we get in the beds and don\u2122t worry about getting them dirty. And then they brought us bread that was as white as the sheets were. Couldn\u2122t believe that. But anyway they took us back to Holland and they put us in a convent in southern Holland, where the Dutch then sorted things out. And you had to have a place to stay before they\u2122d send you back to Amsterdam. And that was taken care of."

His closest friend was an American. His father was the distributor for Ho lland and Belgium of RKO, the movies. And I think he stayed with them. And my parents stayed w ith, I don\u2122t even remember who it was. Somebody. So we were in different locations. We weren\u2122t really, and this was like, talking the summer of \u201a45. There really wasn\u2122t much goi ng on. Trying to see about getting back into school. My high school class had graduated. I think we may have actually been back in Amsterdam when the graduation was, but of course they wouldn\u2122t give me my diploma. Hadn\u2122t been there in four years. Four out of six wasn\u2122t good enough. And so my mother was making arrangements to see what the school about me tr ying out, well both of us, trying to get back into school in the Fall. What the requirements would be, and trying to line up a tutor and a place to live. And I think, somebody\u2013 the Dutch did thin gs fairly reasonably. The person that was living in our house had gotten there in good faith. He did not know, or they did not know that was the property or the residence of deported Jews. And so what they did, if the person had something in good faith, so you don\u2122t have, just transf er the victim from on e person to another. They could stay there. So my parents f ound a place to live. And I don\u2122t know where the furniture came from, whether that was, whethe r those were donations or purchases or whether they had given some of that furniture to somebod y to hide. But anyway we ultimately had an apartment where we lived. And then school started pretty soon. We had a tu tor trying to get us up to speed, because I was allowed into the senior class on the condition that if I didn\u2122t measure up, that the school would have the right not to let me take the comprehensive exams at the end of the year. Well that\u2122s the deal they made with my parents, obviously. Apparently I did all right because\u2013 and I do remember having to go to a c ouple of teachers after classes for additional instruction. It\u2122s kind of tough to pick up solid geometry if you haven\u2122t had trigonometry. So, trying to catch up."

We were in Spain and there was a couple in that group that we were with, who were Germans, who had retired. He had worked for General Motors and they lived in Windsor, across in Cana da. And they had invited a friend of theirs from Germany to come down and join us. We were on the trip up to Granada to see the Alhambra. And on the way back we were sittin g at a table and this man came wandering in by himself. I said to him in German, \ufb01How are you doing?\ufb02 He complained, \ufb01Not very well.\ufb02 He didn\u2122t speak English, and so unless his friends were around\u2013 blah, blah, blah. And then on a stop on the way back, we were standing in line together and he said, \ufb01How come you speak German so well?\ufb02 And I was debating what to say.

And we had to work half day Saturdays. And then we took, had to take\u2013 we didn\u2122t have to, we took turns taking calls on the weekends. That paid an extra six dollars. And the girls all were more interested in going to the beach, so I took all of their calls, because I needed the six dollars more than I needed a suntan. And then I got a ticket. Two weeks in this country and I got a ticket. That was Saturday morning, going to work, I was going down the subway and a cop stopped me . I didn\u2122t know what he wanted. I didn\u2122t understand enough of what he was saying. And so I pulled my passport out and I opened it on the immigration stamp to show him I don\u2122t, you know it was two weeks. I did understand what identification was. And so he proceeded to write and tore this thing out, gave me my passport back and tore this thing out and told me it was a ticket. Well the only meaning of the word ticket I knew was admission to a theater. Didn\u2122t want to, don\u2122t have time to go. Tried to explain\u2013 finally made me take it, he told me I didn\u2122t ha ve to go myself, I could give it to somebody else. When I got to work I tried to tell the fellow I work with, I asked him if he wanted the ticket. He said what for? (Laughing.) I told him I di dn\u2122t know, but a cop had given it to me. So he explained to me that I had gotten a ticket for whatever, well, it was June and first of July was the end of the fiscal year and he had to make his quota, so he was writing tickets furiously and I guess I looked like a good sucker for one. And when I became a citizen you have to list all non-moving traffic violations excepted. So I went back to court to find out what the heck I had done.

And the State Department was so strongly anti Semitic, they saw it as their function to keep as many Jews out as they could, not to try and rescue as many and let them in. And the Immigration Service di dn\u2122t help matters either. An uncle of mine when he went for his hearing wa s asked for his convictions. He said he didn\u2122t have any.

You had to be a resident for five years. You had to demonstrate your fluency in English, not like toda y where they\u2122ll give it to you in Spanish or French or whatever. And lastly you had to demo nstrate a knowledge of American history. And the Daughters of the American Revolution used to give courses in American history for foreigners. Who was the 23rd president?

(Laughing.) And he stopped me when I got to Vermont. So I got off easy. I got at least 12 of the 13.

I\u2122m not sure what it was supposed to be. But they were pretty strict and\u2013 depending on the judge, most of those were not all that bad. But there was\u2013 well Dupont did not hire its first Jew until World War Two. And when I graduated from college in \u201a54, Armstrong-Quartz (ph) still didn\u2122t hire Jews.

Of the remaining eleven, three brothers were here and four si sters. And the one brother was picked up during the Kristallnacht thing in \u201a38 and taken to Dachau. And then was released because he had pneumonia, so he wouldn\u2122t die in a concentration camp, so they could count him as having released him, rather than having him die there. And he died at home. And they decided they better get th eir son out before he\u2122s going to get it too. But my mother\u2122s sister-in-law w ith her daughter stayed and they perished. And another sister and her husband had moved to Belgium in the early \u201a30s. He was a very prosperous furniture manufacturer. They had two daughters. And they actually helped one of the other sisters\u2122 children, they managed to get out, I guess, as late as \u212242, by way of Belgium and through Portugal. They stayed for a while w ith them. But that c ouple with their children, the sister, they perished. As a ma tter of fact, I had documentation of them at one time, their death certificates. And then on my father\u2122s side, my grandmother, my dad\u2122s mother, lived in Amsterdam also. And she had cardiac problems so bad, she couldn\u2122t have walked from here to the front door without taking nitroglycerine, but she survived the cattle car ride to the gas chambers and died at Auschwitz. And one of, hi s sister was here, but hi s brother was still in Germany and he perished. And so no, we, and fo rtunately for my mother\u2122s, my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, she died in late \u201a 44, so she never did find out what happened to her children, those that were in Europe. But no, that was a common topic of conversation in the family. My\u2013 the son that was sent over, he we nt back to his hometown looking for his parents or for his mother and sister. He was in the Army. Some of my other cousins that were in the Army went looking for the relatives and for us.

            "question": "How about other, just looking back over your years here after the war in the United States. Were you really mainly just focusing on your work and your family or did you have other interests or passions outside of that?",
            "answer": "Oh yeah, I have a number of hobbies. For one thing, I like to cook and obviously like to eat. (Laughing.) And gardening, although my garden right now doesn\u2122t show that. And I always like to travel, but of course, with a family and work that isn\u2122t always possible. So we made up for it since I retired. And I enjoy history, learning about it, learned more about it since I retired, I guess. Now I have time to watch television a nd the History channel and A&E and of course, KET to some extent. So that\u2013 a lot more exposure and therefore an ability to learn a lot more. And then too, when we travel, we do it with the intent, not always the same. I don\u2122t go for these Caribbean cruises, you know, \ufb01Show me, feed me, entertain me.\ufb02 I like cruises because they are a lazy man\u2122s way of traveling\u0160you only pack and unpack once\u0160but there has to be a reason for it. And sometimes they are r eal eye-openers. A couple of years we went on an Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea cruise and we were in Constanta, Romania, which is the major port of Romania on the Black Sea. Ovid was exiled th ere for seven years or whatever. Well, never even thought that the Romans as well as the Greeks, both came up the west coast of the Black Sea, east coast of the Balkan Peninsula. And that they had gone that far North into what is now Odessa and to the Crimea. I\u2122m sure it\u2122s of no importance right now, but in terms of historical event, just didn\u2122t think about that or heard about it. A lot of things like that. But as we talked earlier about the famine, and what complicity the British had. The other day there was a fascinating program on the Vikings. They were the kings of Kiev in Russia. They went east. Nobody\u2013 I never heard that before."

            "question": "What about Holocaust-era histor y? Have you done much reading a bout that or taken an interest in finding out what happened on a broader scale?",
            "answer": "Oh yes, yes, definitely. As you know there ar e a lot of programs, bits and pieces. There is a lot\u2013 new things, but also things that are being, I think, being hidden from view that never show again. The\u2013 well of course, in addition to Spielberg\u2122s movie, I\u2122m not sure what the show was the other day, but there are a number of programs that deal with the Holocaust or deal with certain aspects of the Holocaust. Or for that matter, not necessarily in that context, but primarily in the context of Nazis or Hitlerism and thei r henchmen and how they got involved and what they did. And the Holocaust in th e broadest sense, in terms of th e enslaving of particularly the Slavs, the eastern Europeans and the murder, geno cide of them, not necessarily just the Jews. But then one thing, and I have a video of it, it was on PBS maybe twenty-five years ago, about USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 32 32Fort Ticonderoga, and I have never seen it again. I mentioned to you earli er the anti-Semitism of the State Department. In 1943, when the Holocaust became pretty well-known in government circles, but was being hidden from the Americ an population, a number of Henry Morgenthau\u2122s employees went to him and said, \ufb01You go to FDR and tell him he does some thing or else we\u2122re going to go public that the U.S. government knows a bout this and isn\u2122t doing anything.\ufb02 And as a consequence of that, they brought some six, 800, what was then called DPs, displaced persons, to this country. They had to sign a statement, which of course anybody in his right mind would have, that after the war they would go back to their country of origin. And they put them into Fort Ticonderoga. And after the war was over with, they tried to ship them back. Well, you know, you signed this thing. But a number of coupl es had had children here. They were born at Fort Ticonderoga and therefore they were native-born citizens, and therefore their parents were entitled to stay here as the parents of minor American citizens. The State Department declared Fort Ticonderoga was not American soil and therefore they were not American citizens. Can you imagine a place that is so hist orically important in the Amer ican Revolution being declared not being a part of America? I mean that\u2122s the kind of convoluting, convolutions, unfortunately, our government went through. As I said, that was a PBS show, 25 years ago, I have never seen it again. I guess too many toes were being step ped on. But\u2013 and of course, I went to the Holocaust museum, but I couldn\u2122t take it, make it past the Saint Louis, because I remember that one vividly. Another black mark in our history."

It\u2122s incredible that the things that the U.S. government could have done, should have done a nd never did do. It\u2122s that kind of malfeasance that really upset me, particularly in that context."

            "question": "Related to that, I\u2122m interested in something you said in your last interview, which was a piece of advice that you were giving to other Holocaust survivors. That many have met with very good fortune in their post-war lives and that they ought to do what they can to give something back to the community. And so on the one hand you have th at compulsion or that desire and on the other hand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings of this government and the ways that they have, have really not served the\u2013 and in particular in the couple of instances you just brought up, Holocaust survivors. How do you reconcile those two?",
            "answer": "Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separa te issues. Maybe they are related, and that is by giving back to the community, by helping people that are in need of help. Maybe because the government should and isn\u2122t, that you\u2122re overcom ing the shortcomings of our government. Even though I don\u2122t take that into consideration. There are two ways that one can give back, one is financially and that\u2122s the easy way out that most of us take, is to make contributions to a variety of charitable organizations, or non-profit organizations. But then the more important one is to give of your time and help people. I\u2122m sure the same thing holds true for Lexington, in Louisville there is a shortage, an incredible shor tage of volunteers. And all of us retirees who have spare time, and we should have spare time, should donate some of that time to some of these organizations. Whether it\u2122s Dare to Care to sort out cans of food, or work at the Wayside Christian Mission as an example, any of these she lters, and dish out food for people in need. Or USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 33 33I work in the tax program, in fact I have somebody come in who needs help with their taxes. One of the great organizations in general of a variety of needs is Catholic Charities. And they\u2122re desperate for volunteers. Obviously: they asked me to help. (Laughing.) And I have. But the thing is, that is one way that you can give back. And whether it\u2122s in your own expertise or if it\u2122s just plain labor. Some people are unwilling to become raw labor, drive for Meals on Wheels or drive for Dare to Care and pick up bread at Kroger or whatever. But that\u2122s the kind of jobs that need to be done. And that\u2122s the kind of things that makes ma ny of these non-profit organizations click. Newt Gingrich, who is so maligned, some f our or five years ago, for his reasons felt that the public radio should no longer be funded by the U.S. government. And I completely agree with him. But that doesn\u2122t mean that today th ey give them big hunk of money and tomorrow it\u2122s zilch. Cut it back. I work for the public radio stations here as a volunteer. And they used that withdrawal of government funds to encourage the public to contribute and they did tremendous, the biggest drive they ever had. And rightly so. I\u2122m a firm be liever in putting the public back into public radio and public television, but it requires a commitment on the part of the people to make financial donations. And that\u2122s just one, that\u2122s not nearly as, I suppose, important as helping somebody who\u2122s hungry or reading for the blind, but it\u2122s one of the large variety of volunteer jobs that needs to be done. It\u2122s amazing, I don\u2122t do that much. I\u2122m not trying to pat myself on the back. But one of the people that used to work for me professionally now actually works for me in a volunteer, one of his volunteer activities, got the GE volunteer award of the year, he and his wife, jointly, this past year. Between the two of them they put in three thousand hours a year, that\u2122s a hell of a lot of hours. That\u2122s almost a fulltime job. If we could get half the people to do half that or for that matter, ten percent of the people to do ten percent of that, it would be a lot of help. And that\u2122s what I mean by that."

            "answer": "Oh yes, well, no I think or it appears at leas t that more recently that the antagonism toward Louisville, Louisville versus the rest of Kentucky, seems to be diminishing. But that is, you know the large city versus the rest of the state. Look at New York and New York City, Georgia and Atlanta and you know, you can go on. I think it\u2122s probably true of most states that the large cities are thought to be representative and they\u2122re not. Even though they contain most of the population. And I can understand that. And the interests of Kentucky in particularly are so diverse, from Appalachia with its problems, and Western Kentucky with some of the same problems and some totally different problems. And Louisville, of course, for painfully obvious reasons having totally different problems that peopl e in Appalachia couldn\u2122t care less about. But that\u2122s true everywhere. And it\u2122s amazing, the th ing that I thought that the United States was unique, unfortunately, in its race relations problems. They\u2122re not. It\u2122s the same everywhere. It doesn\u2122t matter what country you go to, it may not be like we have, black and white. But we were in New Zealand and there was a big ruckus and the Royal Commission on Race Relations or whatever it was, got involved, refused to get involved in it. Well, the mere fact that they have a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 34 34Royal Commission on Race Relations says there\u2122s a problem there. And it\u2122s the Maoris, which are no longer in existence. The purest Maori is one-eighth Maori and seven-eighths white. And in Australia it\u2122s the indigenous people versus the settlers. And then of course among the settlers you get the same ethnic divisions that you get everywhere else. Look right now, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, the whole world is erupting in ethnic and race problems. Africa is just a terrible situation."

Why I don\u2122t know. There\u2122s a fairly good sized, there was a\u0160there may still be\u0160a good-sized Jewish community in Durham because of the tobacco in dustry. Apparently they brought the Jews down in order to make cigars, like they did in Tampa with the Cubans. And then, I still remember the man\u2122s name, Bishop Waters was the Catholic Bi shop for North Carolina. The little town of Washington, North Carolina was two parishes, a black and a white. Neither one of them could support a priest, and he ordered them integrate d. Boy was there ever a stink, but it worked. Wasn\u2122t\u2013 no more than two months and they essen tially had ninety percent attendance of the two parishes in one church building. It was unheard of. Of course the press would claim race relations are only bad in the South. Well, they\u2122re probably a lot better in the South than they were elsewhere. But yeah, I certainly was keenly aware of it, and cautious. Before I bought a house in Houston, this was in the late fifties, I consulted with a local friend to say \ufb01Hey, so that I don\u2122t stub my toe, is there anyplace that I cannot go? Where I would be refused because I am Jewish?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Yes. Don\u2122t go to Oak Fo rest,\ufb02 or Forest Oaks, whatever it was called, which I couldn\u2122t anyway, that was the rich neighborhood. But you learned to do those things."

It\u2122s up for voting on election day, you can bet money on it, it won\u2122t happen. The race relations right now are just so terrible. All you have to do is look at other communities and other cities and that\u2122s not just\u2013 take this house here as an example, which you can buy similar house here for depending on the condition and age, but let\u2122s say 150 to 250. Go to Silicon Valley you couldn\u2122t touch it for two and a half million dollars. In other areas, yeah you may be able to get for less, bu t most areas you can\u2122t touch it for twice the amount of money. Matter of fact , most retirees moving out of Ca lifornia, sell their houses and live happily ever after, because they can buy another house somewhere else in Arizona or in Florida for a fraction of what it\u2122s worth in California. Our food prices are reasonable, with the exception of gasoline in Jefferson County. I went to Shelbyville last night and paid 40 cents a gallon less than what it is in Louisville. I mean that\u2122s ridiculous. Could have gone as far as Simpsonville, that\u2122s only ten miles, 25 cents a gall on. But outside of these temporary distortions, Louisville has grown up a lot in the last 15, 20 years. I used to get all my bread from Chicago, now there\u2122s a grocery store over on Taylorsville Road that carries it and I can go get it there. We used to go to Cincinnati to get a three month supp ly of cold cuts, now I can buy almost all of it here. And so on and so forth. We\u2122re blessed he re with, within two mile s or three, excellent bakeries and different bakeries. If you want a certain thing you get it here. How many communities can you say that?
