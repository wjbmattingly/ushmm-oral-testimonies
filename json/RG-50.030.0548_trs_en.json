When \u201cMein Kampf\u201d was written, my mother was very smart, and she says, this guy is not fooling around. He\u2019s really gonna kill us all. We better get the hell out of here. And a lot of Dutch Jews had the misconception that Holland would stay neutral. And why was that? Because during World War I, Holland stayed neutral. And they figured \u2014 so they said, well, even if, you know, the war breaks out, we\u2019ll just stay neutral in Holland and we have nothing to worry about.

If we \u2014 th \u2014 it\u2019s not good, we must leave Europe. She was obsessed with leaving Europe and going to America. And nobody wanted to listen to her, because in Holland, like I said, they \u2014 they all thought nothing was gonna happen there. And there were other people like my mother. My \u2014 as a matter of fact, after I got married, my father-in-law \u2014 my \u2014 my husband\u2019s grandfather was the same thing, he also saw it come.

And that\u2019s how a lot of people felt. My whole family could have been saved, because my mother had a brother whose wife Interview with Jos\u00e9 Coltof \u00b0 November 9, 2008 had a sister in England, in London, married to a famous hazan there, and she would have \u2014"

I don\u2019t have it any more, but it was, I guess, a sign from God to show me who I was. And I can imagine how terrible for my mother. I mean, she would \u2014 the children that were older, that were reunited with their parent, they run to their parent, Mommy, Mommy. I didn\u2019t run to my mother, I didn\u2019t want to go to her. On the other hand I also understand my foster parents, who knew when they took me, it wasn\u2019t an adoption. It was \u2014 I was given there for safekeeping.
