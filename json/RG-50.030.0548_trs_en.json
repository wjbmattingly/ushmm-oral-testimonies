My mother, yes she had lost her whole family, which by the way, she didn't know yet at that point, because people didn\u2019t know until a few years after if people had survived the war. It wasn\u2019t the computer age, and the Red Cross gave you the information. And people went for years after to look at lists at the Red Cross to see if anybody had survived.

She asked to see if they had the suitcase that she packed for me. And sure enough they produced it, and she looked to see if I had the birthmark on my thigh and there it was. I don\u2019t have it any more, but it was, I guess, a sign from God to show me who I was. And I can imagine how terrible for my mother. I mean, she would \u2014 the children that were older, that were reunited with their parent, they run to their parent, Mommy, Mommy. I didn\u2019t run to my mother, I didn\u2019t want to go to her.
