            "question": "This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview conducted by Peggy Frankston, with Mrs. Lucie Ragin, on July 23\", 2009, in New York City, for the Rivesaltes Internment Camp Memorial Museum. Good morning Mrs. Ragin.",
            "answer": "Yes, ma \u2014 good morning. My name is Lucie Ragin, I was born Lucie Laya(ph) Saltz, and my parents felt that Zalc, z-a-l-c, but Saltz, s-a-I-t-z is also how it\u2019s spelled. And I was born in Antwerp, Belgium, February 27, 1935. And my mother and father were very loving parents. My father\u2019s name was David Saltz, and my mother\u2019s name was Miriam Clara Saltz. And they already had a son, his name is Andre Zalc, Abraham Zalc. And we were a very happy family, and Antwerp is a beautiful ci \u2014 city by \u2014 by the ocean. And my aunt and uncle lived in the same town in a ver \u2014 1n a Jewish community there, we lived. And my aunt and uncle had a bakery. And that\u2019s the only family we really had. Most of my father\u2019s family was in Poland, and my mother had some family left in Latvia, Russia, and \u2014 which we never met, but we were very close to my family, my mother\u2019s aunt and uncle \u2014 ma \u2014 my aunt and uncle, and I always would go there as a little girl and on the holidays and we \u2014 my mother and \u2014 would make wine with her sister, and I \u2014 I loved the goodies in the bakery that they owned, so I always liked to go there. And Interview with Lucie Ragin : July 23, 2009 we were very happy family and all of a sudden they said it wouldn\u2019t be good for the Jewish people to stay in Antwerp because the war was broke \u2014 breaking out. So my parents and my aunt and uncle, we decided to leave Antwerp, and we packed whatever we could in a \u2014 1n a rush to leave, and \u2014 for France. And I was a little girl, I really didn\u2019t understand too much. I saw people taping the window, because they were afraid that their houses would be bombed, and they put tape on the window so it wouldn\u2019t shatter. And we took a duffle bag, whatever we could, and we left by train to go to France. And I remember the Red Cross in the \u2014 in La Gare, in the station, and they would help all the people and give them hot chocolate and things like that. And when they packed in a rush, one of the scissors that they packed was sticking up, and I sat on that bag, and I had to be treated by the Red Cross, and that\u2019s why I remember that incident. And the train went on, and we really didn\u2019t know where we were going in France, and we went towards this \u2014 I guess on the \u2014 the southern part of France, and my aunt and uncle were with us, we were all 1-in a place called Brens(ph), which was a camp. And from there we went to Recebedou, or vice-versa. And then we ended up in Rivesaltes, which was the worst one, I think, of them all. I remember barbed wire, but I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I think I was wearing a Jewish star, but I\u2019m not positive. I was a little girl, and my mother was pregnant, and it was very hard for her because we didn\u2019t have any food, and we Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lucie Ragin \u00b0 July 23, 2009 didn\u2019t have many things. And whatever she had, she would give to her children. And I rem \u2014 and my father in camp, he\u2019s \u2014 he knew \u2014 he was a plumber there, they used him to do plumbing, and he helped people get out of the camp, and they paid him by giving him like an egg, a tomato, a few potatoes and this way he would make his food. But they were aware of what he was doing, so he had to leave the camp and not come back. He had to leave my mother and me there and not come back, because there were \u2014 and every day they would come and they would pick up my mother, I don\u2019t know if it was the Vichy. I remember a German Shepherd also, and they would take my mother for questioning, because they thought she knew where he was, but she didn\u2019t. And I \u2014 I used to see my cousin in camp, and my aunt. I don\u2019t remember about my uncle and my boy cousin. But we were very hungry, very, very hungry. There was hardly any food. I know my mother always said if you got like a hundred grams of bread and a little bit of turnip soup and if they punished you, they would take it away from you. That\u2019s what she said. And \u2014 and she was always worried about everybody. And I remember in the camp, they put me in the little children\u2019s nursery, or whatever, and I would \u2014 I was always crying \u2014 they called me \u2014 I was always crying, I was always sad, I was a very sad little girl because I always wanted to be with my mother. And I even had the German measles there, and they put me in the infirmary. And I had the window by \u2014 I slept by the Interview with Lucie Ragin \u00b0 July 23, 2009 window in the infirmary, and there were other children there, and the mothers would come by the window and they wanted to give things for their children, and I would \u2014 I know I wasn\u2019t allowed to take it, but they like more or less forced me to do it. And then they took me away from by the window so I couldn\u2019t see anybody. And we were there, and also I was in a little nursery where I cried all the time because I wanted to be with my mother. And one day I escaped when the milkman came, and I ho \u2014 I heard all the loudspeakers talking, you know, listening to my name, and \u2014 and somehow I thought I would find my mother, but all the barracks looked alike, and I couldn\u2019t find her. So somebody recognized me and they took me to my mother and somehow she must have convinced them \u2014 convinced them to let me stay there. And \u2014 but I know everybody was very, very hungry, and there was a lot of suffering all around me. My girl cousin was very close to me and I would see her once in a while, but she was older and you know, they divided you by age. The rabbi in the camp heard that they were going to send everybody to Auschwitz, so he told my mother to try to escape. My brother had \u2014 and my father were no longer there. We didn\u2019t know where they were. You have to remember that in those days there was no radio, no communication from the outside, nothing. So you really didn\u2019t know what was going on. After the war we found out that my brother was given away to a French family. But the rabbi gave my mother a few francs and told Interview with Lucie Ragin \u2018 July 23, 2009 her to escape. So we had a pass to see my sister, who was born at the maternity [indecipherable]. And instead of going to see her, we escaped. And my mother had spoken to one of the nurses there and she said not to worry, that she\u2019s gonna try and get her out of camp. My mother was unbelievable, very strong lady, very strong, that she could survive all of this. And with a few francs we went \u2014 we didn\u2019t go to see my sister, my mother took me to the La Gare, which 1s the railroad station. And she tried to buy tickets for us, she just had enough money to buy us tickets to go to Marseilles. And in Marseilles, she knew my father would be there. There was a hotel where all the Jewish people stayed, and she figured somebody there would know where my father was. So \u2014 but at the station, I started to cry and she was afraid that the Germans would \u2014 because you had to show a pass wherever you went, so she was afraid that the Germans would notice me crying, so she bought me soda. I wanted soda to keep me quiet. So when she went to buy the ticket, the money that she used for the soda, she didn\u2019t have enough for the tickets. So she met a woman there that she\u2019s a French lady, and she sold her \u2014 she had a piece of soap, and she sold her the piece of soap and the lady and my mother bought the tickets and she took us on the train and spoke for my mother, cause my mother only spoke Yiddish and very little French, and they used to come on the train to ask for identity. But my mother made believe like she was sleeping, and I was a little girl, I Interview with Lucie Ragin \u00b0 July 23, 2009 spoke a little French, so that was all right, and the woman took care of me. But the minute we arrived in Marseilles, she \u2014 she told my mother, I can no longer stay with \u2014 with you, because \u2014 she kissed us goodbye and she left us right there. So we didn\u2019t know really where to find my father, but we knew there was a place in Marseilles called Hotel Avant(ph). I don\u2019t know exactly how she found that out, but we tried to go there and I was afraid of anybody that wore a uniform, so my mother was going to stop, she saw a mailman, and ask him. And I carried on so that she couldn\u2019t even ask him, but somehow she did after a while, and we found a place, Hotel Avant(ph) in Marseilles, where all the Jewish people were assembled. But it wasn\u2019t a very good place to stay, because the Germans would come with big trucks and they would raffle \u2014 they would do a raffle at night and take everybody to Auschwitz. So we were in that hotel, it\u2019s like a miracle. My father\u2019s friend was there, and he said he hasn\u2019t seen my father for a while. Sometimes he comes in there, but he hasn\u2019t seen him for a while. But that night we went to sleep and my father cut his finger while he was \u2014 he was a lumberjack during the war, in th \u2014 in the forest, that\u2019s what he said. And he cut his finger, this finger here, the pointer. I always remember, because he had a big scar. And he had to see a doctor because the bleeding wouldn\u2019t stop. So he \u2014 he came in to see the doctor and my father\u2019s friend said, you know, Mr. Zale, your wife and daughter are here. He said, come on, don\u2019t Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lucie Ragin \u201d July 23, 2009 joke around, it\u2019s impossible. So it just turned out that that\u2019s what happened. So in the morning we saw my father and it was the most exciting time. I\u2019m sorry. And my father went to suture \u2014 oh, my father went to the doctor to suture his wound, and my mother like almost collapsed because my brother wasn\u2019t with him. My brother and father, in the beginning they were like homeless people. But then my father saw that he couldn\u2019t take care of my brother, so he gave him away to a French fa-family. And they took very good care of him. So my mother said she\u2019s not leaving unless he gets my brother, so it took a\u2014 well, we went to this vil \u2014 little village which is called Aix-en-Provence and from there we went with my father to Tres, which was in the southern part of France, where he was living. And the landlady, Madame Laville(ph), she was the landlady where my father lived, and she gave us a bigger room, and my broth \u2014 my father got my brother back from the French people, and we all lived in that room: my mother, my father, my brother and me. And my sister was still at Erna(ph). So the French lady was a wonderful, wonderful lady and she didn\u2019t like the Germans because they killed her son during the war, whatever. And she would take me with her all over. She would take me to the cemetery, she would take me to church. So she wanted to really baptize me. And she gave us like food, and she gave us \u2014 and she let us live there all through the war without paying rent. We all lived in a big room that looked like a restaurant, all of us. And the Germans, Interview with Lucie Ragin \" July 23, 2009 when they came to town, lived upstairs in that hotel. And they didn\u2019t know we were Jewish, so that\u2019s another miracle. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s incredible. So we had a little car \u2014 and then, the Ozay(ph), or the Red Cross, the Swiss Red Cross got my sister out of concentration camp \u2014 out of the internment camp and they brought her to us, to my mother. And my mother had to go to meet her in Marseilles, and on the way back they didn\u2019t like her pass \u2014 you know, they came to see, this one, to see if everything was all right, and they \u2014 they almost didn\u2019t let her get off the bus, because they didn\u2019t like the papers. It didn\u2019t have some kind of signature, and the bus driver said, come on, let\u2019s \u2014 let her go, you know, and then he took off, and she came to Trespeux(ph) Giraud(ph), and we stayed there until liberation, but a lot of things happened in that little village. Sometimes they would come through town, the Germans, and they said ammunition was \u2014 a plane came by and dropped ammunition and whoever has it, they took the whole village, put them in the middle of this little park and they said they\u2019re gonna shoot the priest if \u2014 they\u2019re gonna shoot the priest if the ammunition is not found. But finally, after I don\u2019t know how many hours, they let us go. But we understood everything they said, because Yiddish and German is very similar. And also, in the hotel where we lived, this German soldier was talking to my mother, I don\u2019t know, in German, I guess, and he said, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to him, he really doesn\u2019t want to be a Interview with Lucie Ragin \" July 23, 2009 soldier, he might never see his kids again because you know, it\u2019s war. And he always used \u2014 and he gave me a few candies. So I didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t let on that we were Jewish or anything like that. And we lived in that little village and we really were hungry too, we didn\u2019t have any food. And we had a little carriage for my sister, and inside there was like an opening where she sat. So we would go into the fields and we would steal like potatoes and fruit. And my sister would sit \u2014 we would put it in that opening and my sister would sit right on top and that\u2019s how we would come back to town. And I would \u2014 I went to school there and my brother too, and my little sister stayed with my mother. And we had a very hard time, but all of a sudden they said that the town will be \u2014 would be bombed. And so everybody went into the mountains and \u2014 everybody went into the mountains \u2014 what I forgot to mention, I\u2019ll go back to the mountains later, is that my \u2014 th-the landlady, Madame Laville(ph) wanted to baptize me and my mother said no. Sh \u2014 sh \u2014 I was bor \u2014 my daughter\u2019s born Jewish and she will die Jewish; because they were pretty religious before the war. So she didn\u2019t do anything. But she was always dressed in black because of the death of her son, and she had two little gi \u2014 dogs, one white one and one black one. And she was very good to me, and to my whole family. But when we went up in the mountains, when they said they were gonna bomb the town, that was almost at liberation, but we didn\u2019t know it. We saw planes going by, bombs falling, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lucie Ragin \" July 23, 2009 all kinds of things, and we stayed up there. And then all of a sudden they came and they told us that the war is over, we can go back. So everybody was so excited, but they didn\u2019t let the children go back because they weren\u2019t sure. So they said, let the grown-ups, some grown-ups go back and see if everything\u2019s all right. And then I remember liberation, it was great. All the American tanks came through town, and everybody was so happy, everybody was kissing everybody, they were drinking. And one day I was playing at a fountain right there in the middle of town, and an American soldier, who was a Zionist, I guess, he was looking for Jewish people in that town, if there were any Jewish people. So I was playing with my friends and he came over and he said, which one of you little girls speaks Jewish? And I said, I do. And he says, take me to your mother. So my mother lived right across the street in that hotel. So he \u2014 he went to my mother, and my mother said she had a s-sister in the United States, and he says, on my furlough, I\u2019m gonna try and find out where \u2014 if you \u2014 if she\u2019s still alive, if she\u2019s interested and so on. So the next time he came back to town, he brought my \u2014 he heard from my aunt, he brought us goodies, and every American Jewish soldier that came through town, came to our house and brought us things. And they \u2014 they didn\u2019t know whether they were gonna make it because our little village was the beginning of liberation, but they still had to go on to Paris and France and \u2014 and things like that, so they were a little bit \u2014 some of Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lucie Ragin : July 23, 2009 them were even crying to my mother. And from there we left nac \u2014 we left that little village and we went back to Marseilles, because we wanted to get back to Belgium to find out what happened to the rest of our family. So we went to Marseilles, I went to school there with my brother and my sister, and they still had air raids where you had to go into the shelters in the middle of the day. They still had all these things, and my father worked for the American army, and we saved up enough money and then we went back to Antwerp, Belgium. In 19 like \u201945, at the end of, and my \u2014 and we had to find a little apartment, 1t was very hard, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t find anything. And we found a little apartment and \u2014 and we lived there and every time people would come back on buses to the school that I went to, that\u2019s wha \u2014 they had like a country yard, they would come back there and they would \u2014 my mother would go to see if her sister, my uncle, my aunt, my \u2014 my cousins were alive, and nobody ever came back. And she would never walk in that street ever again, she would go all around. And we \u2014 I forgot to mention that also, when I lived in France, I was in children\u2019s homes, I was in Villa Marianne, which is in south Raphael, and I was very hungry there too, I used to eat the peels from the garbage when we went to the beach. I hated it. First of all, I wanted to be with my mother and father, and we would go to the beach, and I-I didn\u2019t like it because they made you bathe without a bathing suit. They kept you very badly, and the Interview with Lucie Ragin \" July 23, 2009 [indecipherable] priest who was the one in charge, he made parties, and we didn\u2019t have any food, and some of the boys at night would go to the kitchen, they made believe like they were sl-sleepwalking, and bring food for everybody. And life is strange, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just doing this, I\u2019m gonna f \u2014 I\u2019m just doing this \u2014 I always talk about the Holocaust because I don\u2019t want people to forget. And I\u2019m doing it for my parents \u2014 for my parents and my cousins, and that\u2019s it."

                " When I was in Tres, I went to school. I played with the children. We st \u2014 we made little things, little clothes for the dolls, and I always waited for Christmas because the children always got a lot of toys to play with, and \u2014 but I said I was so good, why didn\u2019t I get such a big doll, or why didn\u2019t I get these things. So \u2014 because I didn\u2019t understand, so my mother always used to say, oh, don\u2019t worry. And one day Madame Laville(ph) bought me a lot of toys, so \u2014 cause I waited for Santa Claus just like anybody else. And also, I loved going to school, and my mother sewed, so she sometimes would make me clothes and she would knit a whole night sometimes to make me a pair of socks. Sh-she \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have the things, the material things like other kids, but I wasn\u2019t really that much aware of it, except when I was cold. And my mother gave my brother and me once money for milk. And we had to stand on line to get extra milk for some reason that store was giving \u2014 you could buy more milk and we really needed the milk for my sister Joujou(ph), we called her Joujou(ph), her name is Josephine. And we were playing on line and we lost the money and we came home and we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have the milk, and boy did we get it. My mother always screamed, she was very nervous, and my father was very calm. And my sister is just like my mother, and I\u2019m just like my father. I tried to be very calm. And I learned French, and I learned the Marseillaise, which I Interview with Lucie Ragin me July 23, 2009 still remember til today, I don\u2019t know how, because now I\u2019m living in the United States a long time and I \u2014 sometimes I don\u2019t know all the words to the \u2014 the national anthem all the time, I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I forget sometimes. And I also was in France in the Chateau de Marjolet, which they treated you pretty good. But I was always crying, so I don\u2019t know. I made everybody cry by crying. And also I know a lot of kids had lice, and they put powder on their head, or if they had something wrong with their stomach, and I was \u2014 I love chocolate, I would give everything for chocolate \u2014 so, whatever they gave you, I took it twice, because I got two pieces of chocolate. But they were pretty strict with you, and it wasn\u2019t that bad at the Chateau de Marjolet, but most kids there were orphans, and they cried a lot too, but I made them cry even more, because \u2014 so they told \u2014 they told my mother to come and get me because \u2014 so we had to leave earlier than anticipated. We were there because after the war you couldn\u2019t find an apartment, and my parents had a very small little room. And it was hard to keep us all, we didn\u2019t have a stove, we didn\u2019t have a refrigerator and they still had air \u2014 air raids for \u2014 and my s \u2014 my mother was holding my sister on the way to the shelter and she was missed by a grenade just by a step or two, so 1t was very scary. And there was a man in our building who was deaf, and he stayed in his apartment all through the thing and nothing happened to him, so I always used to say, why do I have to go to the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lucie Ragin \" July 23, 2009 shelter? And I used to go to the movies, I loved musicals. And that\u2019s really how I learned how to speak English, by going to the movies. My mother used to give me a few francs and I would go to the movies with my brother or by myself. At that time it wasn\u2019t like today. And we had \u2014 where we went back to Belgium we had a lot of friends. Our hearts was open to everybody. When we left to come to the United States, the door didn\u2019t close all night long. That\u2019s how many people came to say good-bye to us, and also, after the war, when we lived in Marseilles, we had a young boy who was about 20 years old at the time, he would come and my mother would invite him for Passover and everything and then I heard that he died, my parents were very upset, because he ate too much. You know, aft-after you don\u2019t eat and you start eating after the war, you blow up and you \u2014 something happens to you, and I know he died and my parents were very upset, because he had no parents, nobody and he would come to us. So that was bad, too. And while you\u2019re in camp, you do see a lot, you see people that are laying, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re alive or dead. And you see a lot of bad things. And it\u2019s always with you, and there\u2019s always articles today that will remind you of it. And I\u2019m glad they had the Holocaust Museum, because I go there sometimes. And I try to go to see if I can find pictures that I know. And I find a lot of information and it\u2019s really \u2014 I once read Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Lucie Ragin \" July 23, 2009 that the people that died have no cemetery, so when you go there it\u2019s the same, you know.
