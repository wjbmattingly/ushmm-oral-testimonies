And we could not talk to each other. My -- my cousin, so-called cousin, was a very bright, educated man, but he spoke only English. I said German? No. Polish? No. French? No. Okay. Come. And I followed him, and there I saw this gentleman, gray haired with pink cheeks and the bluest eyes. And I saw my grandmother\u2122s face, and that was my grandmother\u2122s brother, and he spoke still some Polish and German. And I went with them. I remember the ride in the car, alongside the west side highway, and I saw all these lights at night, snake lights, like. And the Hudson River, and we came to the bridge, huge bridge, which was George Washington bridge. We crossed the bridge. I was sitting with my uncle -- great-uncle, and we reached his place in Patterson, New Jersey, it was Patterson. And his wife also spoke Polish and German and was the most wonderful, wonderful lady, who made me feel good, warm. She hugged me, she kissed me , and that\u2122s what I needed. That\u2122s what I needed, I didn\u2122t need any material things, I just wanted to be loved, to -- to belong. And that was the beginning. Interview with Blan ka Rothschild March 16, 2001 17"

And they told the black a ttendant, a very nice man, to take care of me with food and so forth, beca use I couldn\u2122t speak English. And he really took care of me. It was a long trip. And I was dressed very decently, because before I left Germany, all my accumulated coffee that I still had, I exchanged for a nice coat. It was with fur, I remember. And a scarf. And I looked decent, fairly decent. And when I arrived in Detroit, the people at the station were might y surprised. I don\u2122t know what they expected, but they thought that this will come somebody from beyond the moon. Well, I -- sure, I didn\u2122t speak English, but I had brains. And I looked all right, because I -- I had the rations already in Germany to eat, and I had that couple of weeks with my aunt -- great-aunt and uncle. They fed me and they -- they were very, very nice to me. And I spent some time with the people in Detroit. The parents were nice, but their daughter was -- I must say she was cruel to me, because I took away the limelight away from her. And I again was unhappy.

So I -- I went to a Polish part of town in -- in Detroit, that is Polish. And I got myself a little job working on camera cases, and I -- I think I was paid 18 dollars a week, maybe 20, I don\u2122t remember exactly. And I saved the money.

And I am not a very religious person. I -- my husband has -- had a sister who passed away. She left for Palestine when she was a youngster, she was in the Zionist movement and she got married, and she really worked the soil. She was a real sabra.

Once we went to Jerusalem , and I went to the wall, and I stood in front of this -- this -- this plain wall, and I touched -- touched the stones, something inside me cha nged.

I don\u2122t -- I cannot be verbatim, I cannot, but I know that it\u2122s very well known, and I know that existed in many homes. So this came to my mind. Jerusalem, walking the streets, the historical cobbled streets, which led from around the wall, through the 14 station of Jesus were of tremen -- made tremendous impact on me, b ecause I walked on history. Jesus did walk there. Mary Magdalene was there. The Roman soldiers were there. The Hebrews were there, and here I am walking there. Tremendous impact. I went to the mosque, to the blue mosque. I took my shoes off, I saw the people -- very few people in there. I went downstairs where the rock is, and this is allegedly the rock on which Abraham was supposed to sacrifice his son, and God stopp ed him. I don\u2122t know -- these were legends, but to me this was something that history repeated in all the hundreds and hundreds of years. So I sort of became a little part of the history, touching the whole thing. It made tremendous impact on me. Going to Yad Vashem was another story. Going in there and standing at the gallery, looking down at the slabs of stone with the names of the camps, I broke down. I thought I am immune to it, that I will not, but I did break down, and I Interview with Blan ka Rothschild March 16, 2001 31cried. When I walked out, it was one of these beautiful s-sunny days in Jerusalem , and you\u2122re coming out from this dark chamber of remembrances of the tragedy that human people suffered at human hands. And you go out and there is this street with the trees. The street with the trees of the Righteous Gentiles. The contrast is so startling. It is so eye opening. I -- I will never forget til the day I die, my feeling when I saw this. At that point I was not aware of all the Gentiles who did help. I knew smattering of things, because I was always interested reading the books. I knew about Denmark . I knew about sporadic things, but the names that I\u2122ve seen this, and the trees. The whole idea was so special to me that it was the highlight of my trip."

            "answer": "Well, I grew up in a family that was -- my mother and father were non-observant Jews. However, the tradition was kept up. We went for all the big holidays to grandparents, who kept th-the -- Judaism aliv e, and they were religious. They were not Orthodox, but they were religious. I will never forget the Seders, the warm feeling of being with all my family, and with strangers, because we always -- my grandparents invited strangers, this was a tradition, from orphanage, soldiers who were of Jewish origin who did not have place to go to. We always had strangers at the table. And th -- we were only two grandchildren there, I was the older one, and mother\u2122s sister boy was the Interview with Blan ka Rothschild March 16, 2001 32younger one. And they had a cook, and a se rving maid, and there was a long, long table laden with this food, and the people, and the happiness, and the lights, because my grandfather always said let there be a lot of light, it\u2122s a holiday. So all the lights in all the rooms were on. It was such a wonderful, happy feeling. New Year\u2122s we used to go to the temple to pick up my grandparents because th ey were going -- my parents didn\u2122t, and we always brought a -- white flowers with us, a bouquet of white flowers, I don\u2122t know why. So the memories and the -- the -- of the tradition were very strong with me. I -- I believe in some sort of supreme being, but I couldn\u2122t define it. I did not have Hebrew education, neither did my mother. I -- I\u2122m av -- extremely good Jew at heart because I believe in the commandments, and I feel if y -- you don\u2122t have to be Jewish to follow the commandments. And if you follow the commandm ents, you\u2122re religious. My father\u2122s idea was more philoso -- philosophical, he thought that God surrounds us, that God is everywhere, in every huma -- i-in every human, in every living tree, in the nature. And I sort of adopted this. However, in camp, I was questioning, where is that supreme being? Where is God? What\u2122s happening? These are human beings who are doing this to other human beings, therefore, is there a God? The questioning. Long time. I slowly returned to the faith. I\u2122m not a temple goer, but I feel that I am a good Jew because I observe the commandments. I will not steal, I will honor -- unfortunately I don\u2122t have parents, I\u2122m an old lady myself. And I tried to bring up my daughter in th e spirit, and my daughter did not have Bat Mitzvah, but my granddaughter did. So it\u2122 s like coming back. The circle is Interview with Blan ka Rothschild March 16, 2001 33repeating. And when I spoke at my granddaughter\u2122s Bat Mitzvah , I did say it, that the seed survived after all. To me this was very, very powerful statement. In view that so many members of my family were killed, and I felt that I was the weakest link, and I survived, and I was able to produce the next pr -- generation. It was very strong feeling, and this brought me back to the faith."

I don\u2122t need to see this. I never went back, I never went to Dachau or Auschwitz. I know about it, I don\u2122t have to go to see it. People who went during the war, if they go, it\u2122s good. Let them perpetuate the memory of it. I don\u2122t need it. And th-the invitation for three days paid to fly, well it wa s to me almost an insult."

            "answer": "Eternity. These years now, especially now that I grow older, passing by very quickly, too quickly. I want to live long enough to see my granddaughter graduate, to see good things. To see her get married, and then I\u2122ll be completely happy. To hear from people again -- I have listened to you, and I appreciate it. I learned something from you. I adopted some of your ideas. I hope that someb ody sometimes will read or see my tapes in Washington and will let me know. It would be a -- a tremendous thing to know. I -- I received a lot of letters from schoolchildren, from people who listen, even from the sisters in the Catholic school. I send them -- not all of them, but a -- a lot of them to the Holocaust Museum, but I would like to know in the museum itself, if teachers who come for information, or somebody -- if somebody stumbled upon one of my tapes, or visual, or oral, and that I made some impact, that would be wonderful. It would be something -- fulfillment."
