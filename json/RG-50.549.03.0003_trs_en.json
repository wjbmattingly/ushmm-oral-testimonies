I -- my background was -- my parents loved music and they cultivated music in the house, and most of it was classical music, with a sprinkling of some new music, not to the extent that today\u2019s music, but for instance, Gershwin was -- \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d came out in 1938 or \u201939, and -- just prior to the war, and we loved it.

            "answer": "Prior to the liberation, we were locked in a barracks and the windows were shut and they were supposed -- supposedly trying to kill us, but there was not enough time, they had to escape because the Russian forces closed. And the sight through the locked shutters, we could see that the towers were empty, and the SS was gone. And this was the moment that we realized that they abandoned us. And that was April the 26\", I believe, of 1945. Since I was badly hurt, my friends were holding me, and broke the doors and ran to the kitchen, brought some margarine. We stuffed ourselves with the margarine, and we decided to leave the camp. Went across the street, there was the house that the commandant used to live, with the garden. There were several of us, one girl had her mother with, and somebody brought two eggs and two potatoes, and at that moment the commandant came back with a gun. And we were frozen stiff looking at him. And the poignant part was that he was afraid of us. And he disappeared. And we decided to leave. Interview with Blanka Rothschild , March 16, 2001 My friends were helping me. We went through the fields, there was a great deal of firework -- not firework, fire stemming from the war. They were being bombarded, and we ran. We joined with two Polish men who worked there in the fields. We reached the front line and first -- we saw the first Russian, and this was the -- suppose our liberation - supposed liberation. Pretty soon we discovered that this was not the freedom that we were dreaming of. Freedom was very different. We thought of the normal -- normal life that will come of finding the family. It was very difficult period of time."

We just didn\u2019t have time to look, we were running like an animal. The first Russian was of Asiatic origin because his face, the features were Asiatic. And he was very dirty, I remember his big, black leather boots, filthy uniform. He was the liberator, and we thought we should kiss his boots. He told us -- he motioned to us to go back, and the Russians gave us help. The help consisted of a barrel of herring. And we ate the herring, and of course the -- we be-became very thirsty, there was no water, the pipes were broken. And they told us to leave, my friends held me. We reached the first house in the village, the roof was gone from the bombardments. We went to the basement, the basement was very well prepared with food Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Blanka Rothschild : March 16, 2001 and sleeping equipment.

I didn\u2019t see anything there of -- of nor-normal food ration, or even [indecipherable] Red -- Red Cross. But they had some bandages and they gave me the bandages and I was bandaged around my body to hold my ribs. That\u2019s all I remember. And when -- once we went to the basement, 1t was some sort of a trapdoor going down, which I wasn\u2019t familiar with before. We went to the basement and one of the Russians was drunk. Wi -- he started to shoot at the jars which were lined on the shelves, and the pieces of -- pieces of the glass embedded in my left leg, and I was lying down on one of the two cots, and I ask one of the Polish men, please protect me. I -- when the times will be normal, I will give you -- my -- my mother, my family will give you anything in the world if you will help me. He covered me, and he sat down on me. And I was lying there and my leg was bleeding, but I didn\u2019t make a sound. That was the night that two girls -- Interview with Blanka Rothschild \u00b0 March 16, 2001 one was taken out, one was -- they blew the candle out and they raped her, and the other one came bloody back. This was my liberation. Very bitter. We wondered if this is -- 1-1f this was worth it, to survive to see this. The next day we left for the village, to another house."

            "answer": "No. The freedom was very bleak. I was petrified of the Russians now. So, after a couple of days, next house to ours was occupied by the former French prisoners of war. And I talked the them and they decided that they will take me to their house and protect me, and I stayed with them for quite awhile."

            "answer": "Well naturally, I thought that my family survived. I was unaware that everybody was killed. So I wanted -- my first thought was going back to Poland. And there were some Polish people with some sort of equipment that they were going towards Poland and they Interview with Blanka Rothschild \u00b0 March 16, 2001 had carts, and they took me -- they had Polish flag, and we went through Lignitz, I remember, and then -- the names escape me, but I know that we were in Lignitz, and we were in another city big, and that city was already organized, and people already had ration cards, and we slept in a place that we were assigned to. But I still wanted to go to my native city, and there was -- there was a train already, on one of the tracks, and I went with this train to Warsaw. And in Warsaw I got off the train, of course everything was without money and no possessions. A human being is very strong, unbelievably strong. And in Warsaw, I was just standing there with nothing and I saw a man with a s -- truck, and I ask him where he 1s going and he said he is going to L\u00e9dz, which was my city. And I ask him if he will take me, and he agreed. And that\u2019s how I reached it. Warsaw was completely destroyed. There was -- I -- I had uncle and aunt, but I couldn\u2019t find the streets. Everything was in ruins. So I was very glad that I was getting the ride, without money, which I didn\u2019t have. He went -- we stopped in Lublin, I believe and he went out to eat and he left me in the car. And he came back, I think he brought a piece of bread, but I\u2019m not too sure. I was hungry. We reached L\u00e9dz and -- of course, L6dz was not destroyed because it was occupied very quickly. And I tried to go to the place that we lived. I was not let in. The Polish people occupied our place."

So the city had only the first day of bombing and it was not destroyed. And our house was standing, and the so-called superintendent was still the same one. And when he saw me, he thought that he -- that he saw a ghost. He said in Polish, how come I survived, why did I come back. This was the greeting I have -- received. When I wanted to go upstairs to our place, our apartment, the L\u00e9dz place, the people wouldn\u2019t let me in. And I went down and the super said that the Germans own -- took everything out.

I loved the literature. I was, you may say patriotic. I had Polish girlfriends, and I thought on coming back that I will meet some people. I -- I was bitterly disappointed. That stems already from before, because when the war started, my friends didn\u2019t come to see me. They could have in the beginning, before we went to the ghetto.

            "answer": "I went to Israel, don\u2019t remember the -- the -- the year. It was the year after the Six Day War when Jerusalem was returned to Israel. Going to Israel was -- I was not as excited as I maybe should have been, but once I was there, it was the most incredible feeling that occurred when I was at the Wailing Wall. And I am not a very religious person. I -- my husband has -- had a sister who passed away. She left for Palestine when she was a youngster, she was in the Zionist movement and she got married, and she really worked the soil. She was a real sabra. Her children were born there, her grandchildren, Interview with Blanka Rothschild * March 16, 2001 everybody was in the army. So we went to visit her. Once we went to Jerusalem, and I went to the wall, and I stood in front of this -- this -- this plain wall, and I touched -- touched the stones, something inside me changed. I cannot describe the feeling, it was like the history of the millennia came through my body. I reminded myself that my grandfather had on the wall of his room, some sort of a picture and there was saying, Oh Jerusalem, if -- can\u2019t quote it. Something about losing a hand. I don\u2019t -- I cannot be verbatim, I cannot, but I know that it\u2019s very well known, and I know that existed in many homes. So this came to my mind. Jerusalem, walking the streets, the historical cobbled streets, which led from around the wall, through the 14 station of Jesus were of tremen -- made tremendous impact on me, because I walked on history. Jesus did walk there. Mary Magdalene was there. The Roman soldiers were there. The Hebrews were there, and here I am walking there. Tremendous impact. I went to the mosque, to the blue mosque. I took my shoes off, I saw the people -- very few people in there. I went downstairs where the rock 1s, and this is allegedly the rock on which Abraham was supposed to sacrifice his son, and God stopped him. I don\u2019t know -- these were legends, but to me this was something that history repeated in all the hundreds and hundreds of years. So I sort of became a little part of the history, touching the whole thing. It made tremendous impact on me. Going to Yad Vashem was another story. Going 1n there and standing at the gallery, looking down at the slabs of stone with the names of the camps, I broke down. I thought I am immune to it, that I will not, but I did break down, and I Interview with Blanka Rothschild * March 16, 2001 cried. When I walked out, it was one of these beautiful s-sunny days in Jerusalem, and you\u2019re coming out from this dark chamber of remembrances of the tragedy that human people suffered at human hands. And you go out and there is this street with the trees. The street with the trees of the Righteous Gentiles. The contrast is so startling. It 1s so eye opening. I -- I will never forget til the day I die, my feeling when I saw this. At that point I was not aware of all the Gentiles who did help. I knew smattering of things, because I was always interested reading the books. I knew about Denmark. I knew about sporadic things, but the names that I\u2019ve seen this, and the trees. The whole idea was so special to me that it was the highlight of my trip."

            "answer": "Well, I grew up in a family that was -- my mother and father were non-observant Jews. However, the tradition was kept up. We went for all the big holidays to grandparents, who kept th-the -- Judaism alive, and they were religious. They were not Orthodox, but they were religious. I will never forget the Seders, the warm feeling of being with all my family, and with strangers, because we always -- my grandparents invited strangers, this was a tradition, from orphanage, soldiers who were of Jewish origin who did not have place to go to. We always had strangers at the table. And th -- we were only two grandchildren there, I was the older one, and mother\u2019s sister boy was the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Blanka Rothschild * March 16, 2001 younger one.

So the memories and the -- the -- of the tradition were very strong with me. I -- I believe in some sort of supreme being, but I couldn\u2019t define it. I did not have Hebrew education, neither did my mother. I -- I\u2019m av -- extremely good Jew at heart because I believe in the commandments, and I feel if y -- you don\u2019t have to be Jewish to follow the commandments. And if you follow the commandments, you\u2019re religious. My father\u2019s idea was more philoso -- philosophical, he thought that God surrounds us, that God is everywhere, in every huma -- 1-in every human, in every living tree, in the nature. And I sort of adopted this. However, in camp, I was questioning, where is that supreme being? Where is God? What\u2019s happening? These are human beings who are doing this to other human beings, therefore, is there a God? The questioning. Long time. I slowly returned to the faith. I\u2019m not a temple goer, but I feel that I am a good Jew because I observe the commandments. I will not steal, I will honor -- unfortunately I don\u2019t have parents, I\u2019m an old lady myself. And I tried to bring up my daughter in the spirit, and my daughter did not have Bat Mitzvah, but my granddaughter did. So it\u2019s like coming back. The circle 1s Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Blanka Rothschild * March 16, 2001 repeating. And when I spoke at my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, I did say it, that the seed survived after all. To me this was very, very powerful statement. In view that so many members of my family were killed, and I felt that I was the weakest link, and I survived, and I was able to produce the next pr -- generation. It was very strong feeling, and this brought me back to the faith."

Let them perpetuate the memory of it. I don\u2019t need it. And th-the invitation for three days paid to fly, well it was to me almost an insult."
