There are many it now \u0160 but Vit \u2013 Vitsyuv and there we\u2122r e transported, loaded \u2013 loaded in trains, cattle car. My father was a traveled man , and he know that this is something not to believe ; and he was saying: Oh God, help me. So they loaded us in the car with all G erman soldiers with mixed -in Hunga rians which \u2013 from the Hungarian army. And w hatever we could take \u0160 w e left the tables and kitchens, everything \u2013 you know \u2013 with the \u2013 the food on the table; and we just took whatever we could grab. In Vitsyuv , the transport which they loaded us in cattle cars , and then they sealed it, and we traveling. And going around , my father recognized, he says: Oh my God, we are no more in \u2013 in Hungary, we are in Poland. And he says: God \u0160 where could they take us to Poland? We didn\u2122t know about Auschwitz; we didn\u2122t know about anything, and here we are \u2013 going at night. They didn\u2122t give us anything to eat, and people were drinking their urine in the rail \u2013 in the car, crying ; and we had some \u2013 some of them were already suffocated to death in that railroad car. It took us about three and a half days to reach the destination. Interviewer: What time of the day did you get into the \u2013? Irving Hass: We got in to \u2013 I would say, in the morning, about eleven o\u2122clock \u0160 in the morning. Interviewer: Do you remember when this was? Irving Hass: It was \u2013 I think \u2013 it was in 19 \u2013. I \u2013 I would know it was in, uh, early \u0160 end of April \u0160 or early \u2013 about \u2013 about \u0160 it was still snow. It was about April. Interviewer: Late April, early April? Irving Hass: Yes. They opened the railroad ca rs, and then there w as all SS men \u0160 in front of the cars ; and they unloaded us. We stay \u2013 we \u2013 Interviewer: What did you have with you? Irving Hass: I had no baggage, nothing. That\u2122s all I had, my clothes; and my father carried a valise. I don\u2122t know what he took in his valise. Maybe he took whatever jewelry ; maybe he took whatever \u0160 his praying things. And \u0160 my mother had the little girl with her and my four sisters. Interviewer: So your entire family \u2013 4 Irving Hass: Entire family; there was a man with a stick and said : Left and right . Interviewer: German or Hungarian? Irving Hass: German; t his was in \u2013 in Auschw itz. That was Poland, and we arrived in Aus chwitz. And a s we were going, I do n\u2122t know what side I was going. It was the left or the right; and h e wa s segregating. And t hat\u2122s the last time I saw my f ather and mother and my four sisters. I don\u2122t \u0160 say five sisters. It was four \u2013 five sisters ; my father and mother and five sisters; and my mother was crying. They took me away, and I wound up in the barracks; wooden barracks in Auschwitz. I thought I saw chimneys there and smoke and people going around. And the sleeping on a wood en shelf; it \u2122s like a shelf \u0160 staggered. And one day in Auschwitz, people were assembling to go. And I didn\u2122t care where they goin g; I jumped out of the barracks, and I got in the line. And the line was lucky; we were transferred to \u2013 Theresien stadt. And \u2013 and \u2013 Theresienstadt, I don\u2122t know what that camp, that Theresienstadt, and we were \u2013 . Find out we were, I \u2013 I was out of Auschw itz. And I even was lucky; I didn\u2122t get a number on my arm. I \u2013 Inte rviewer: Was this by cattle car as well? Irving Hass: Yeah; a nd I didn\u2122t care, I didn\u2122t rea lize it. I \u2013 th is transport, there were people lining up. In \u2013 in Auschwitz, could have been may be to go to the crematorium, I didn\u2122t know. I was lucky that transport was g oing to Theresienstadt to work. And I wind up there, I was no more in Auschwitz; I was in T heresienstadt. And f rom there I was working. Interviewer: How long were you in Auschwitz then? Irving Hass: I would say I was in Auschwitz not more than four days. That was my luck because I got myself in that transport. And that from \u2013 from God \u0160 gave me to mix myself in with the other people. Interviewer: So you took the initiative \u2013 Irving Hass: Initiative. Interviewer: \u2013 to join this transport? Irving Hass: I didn\u2122t know where they were going. Interviewer: No. Irving Hass: I took the initiative , and this saved my life. 5 Interviewer: Yeah, yeah , yeah . Irving Hass: And I would \u2013 I \u2013 I would probably have been \u2013 been burned in Auschwitz just like my fath er and mother and five sisters. I was working in Theresienstadt there , and they were \u2013 they were taking us out to work. And w e were working \u2013 working on a highway, to make a highway. I remembe r we had \u0160 the stones had to be standing up and flat. And each one, individual, put in by hand. And th ey had machinery they put me in; t hey were grinding stones. Today \u2122s date, I have to yell sometimes; I think I\u2122m there. People tell me , don\u2122t yell when you talk to me. Now , and it \u2013 my wife couple of times said , and some people also when I talk and I forget myself \u0160 because I was working with a guy next to the stone machine, we couldn\u2122t hear each other. I was screaming to \u2013 to say a word he should understand what \u2013 what it mean \u2013 what I\u2122m talking. And f rom t hen on I\u2122m thinking. I\u2122m looking \u0160 still on this machine ; and that I\u2122m talking. So we were \u2013 I worked in there for \u2013 it last f or about, I would say, nine or ten months. Interviewer: What kind of people were working? Irving Hass: All mixed people from all over. I met people in \u2013. I met an \u2013 a Italian with me in the barracks. Interviewer: So this transport \u2013? Irving Haas: Transport was all mixed , the people from \u2013 from \u2013 from Poland ; from \u2013 from \u0160 there\u2122s no Romanian. Romania n did not send that time people to concentration camps. I know fo r a fact because the \u2013 we were in the Hungary. I was born under Romanian , and then the \u2013 the Hungarian took over. And \u2013 and o ur town was full of troops with Hungarians; soldi ers with the \u2013 with Germans, all integrated. Interviewer: Were there many Jews in this transport? Irving Ha ss: All Jews. Interviewer: All Jews; o kay, all Jews. Irving Ha ss: And t his tran sport was all Jews when I went Theresienstadt. And t hey were from \u2013 even from Italy ; Jews there , because we was \u2013 we were talking. Interviewer: Did you have a \u2013 a uniform? Irving Ha ss: They gave me that stripe. Interviewer: The striped uniform? 6 Irving Ha ss: That striped uniform, and it really was \u2013. While we talk \u2013 wher ever I get a hold of paper, and had paper, I wrapped myself around \u0160 under the uniform; kept you warm. And w e were getting one meal a day which is \u2013 a \u2013 la [?] \u2013 water and whatever. And I still did not care what I d o; so I was sleeping in the barracks , and I wa s going at night to go into places where I stole potatoes. I was small , and I crawled underneath ; and the guys used to tell me : You\u2122re gonna be shot . I sa ys: What can I worry about to be shot? I came back with \u2013 with potatoes \u0160 raw potatoes, and we were ea ting. I came back with \u2013 with whateve r. Think I went there in \u2013 in the \u2013 in the place at night, and I took chances. And m y luck was always with me, with my chances. Then we got another transport, and they \u2013 and they sent me out to another camp. And t hat \u2013 that transport, we were working in a factory. We were making some kind of a \u0160 I don\u2122t know what \u2013 what it \u2013 what it called \u0160 some kind of a powder, or some kind of a \u2013. W e were bagging in bags or something. Interviewer: Where was this? Irving Ha ss: I \u2013 I d on\u2122t remember the town. It was close to \u2013 what it \u2013 to \u0160 back to the Polish \u0160 it \u2013 it\u2122s a German \u2013 Interviewer: OK Irving Hass: \u2013 where back to the PolishGerman border u sed to be. The Polish occupied it after the war. Interviewer: Oh yeah, that would be near [ph ?] Irving Ha ss: Near , yeah. That \u2013 that \u2013 ther e was a town there, I don\u2122t remember there ; and they \u2013 we were marching in the town, and \u2013 and then going back and so on. And I worked there for approximately six months. And after that, they \u2013 they send us to Flossenb\u00fcrg. Flossenb\u00fcrg was already closer to \u0160 what \u2122d you calling \u0160 in the middle of Germany. And t here I came into the camp , and it was completely \u2013 oh my \u2013 they had already \u2013 they had gas chambers there. I kno w for a fact because there a sign , Ar beit Mach t Frei ; brause bad s \u0160 fine showers. And i n that place , I remember they had \u2013 they had \u2013 because a guy was telling me: We give you a shower there . And they also had, in that \u2013 in Flossenb\u00fcrg they had a camp \u0160 in the camp the people were gassed taking a shower ; when they thought they were going to take a shower. I was working in this \u2013 this labor kommando which they call, labor kommando . And we were going out \u2013 outs ide of town, and were \u2013 cleaning highways. We were \u2013 we were going and \u2013 and lifting, what you call it, railroad tracks. We worked on railroads and everything to correct whatever , and then we even worked in homes, big family homes \u0160 in \u2013 7 in their garden. We did all \u2013 all, whatever \u2013 whatever work we did for this time; and \u2013 an d from Flossenb\u00fcrg, they picked some kommandos. And a kommando I would say, from us must have been maybe 30, 40 people with about four, five SS men. Interviewer: When did you arrive in Flossenb\u00fcrg? Irving Ha ss: In Flossenb\u00fcrg , I arrived in 19 \u2013, by the end of \u2013 of, I would say, August of 1944. Interviewer: August of \u212244; so in \u2013 in those \u2013 from spring until August you had been to Theresienstadt and then to [see Note above]. Irving Hass: , there; yeah. Interviewer: And then to Flossenb\u00fcrg? Irving Ha ss: Flossenb\u00fcrg; Flossenb\u00fcrg was my last camp before the liberation. And there \u2013 where \u2013 i n that Flossenb\u00fcrg, I met a fellow from my town \u0160 in camp. Then I also met a cousin which is the \u2013 the son of that picture; t hat was his son, my cousin. And I couldn\u2122t believe it \u0160 what happened, and I said : You know, and I tell you, whatever the SS do, I am not gonna go hungry , whatever I can , I\u2122m going to \u2013. They marched us from Flossenb\u00fcrg to different labor places. And t he war started g oing closer and closer. We also heard all kind of guns coming in. And then from Flossenb\u00fcrg \u0160 it was May, I would say, about April \u2013 April \u2013 April 20 or April \u2013 in April, the end of April \u0160 they marched us into a forest \u2013 heavy forest. And that must have been, I would say, the day \u2013 the beginning of May. And they set up machine guns, and they killing us out \u2013 start killing . B y luck, I \u2013 was saved in a tree; and I heard after th at \u2013, I watched from under the tree \u0160 I was la ying down. They thought, all the Germans thought, that we were all killed out. We were about 40 people from the entire thing \u2013 were \u2013 a \u2013 alive. Some of them were shot in \u2013 in \u2013 in legs a nd some were \u2013. I got shot in \u2013 in \u2013 from my shrapnel \u0160 in my \u2013 in my right arm. And I was sitting there; and then the Germans changed their clothes , and they disappeared. Intervie wer: How many people were \u2013 were shot at this \u2013 ? Irving Ha ss: It must have been, I would say, close to about 300 peopl e.

The \u2013 the American people had Germans on trucks to 8 come and show \u201a em what \u2013 what happened in \u2013 in the forest; the dead people there. The Americans took the Germans back to the forest to pick up the \u2013 the dead people \u0160 to bury \u201a em. Interviewer: How many people survived this? Irving Ha ss: I would say, we \u2013 we \u2013 I \u2013 I \u0160 from my memory, because I was the only one who couldn\u2122t walk, I was weighing \u2013 weighing only 70 pounds; all my bones were sand , and this soldier picked me up. And h e saw me bleeding , and I got some bandage aro und me and took me to a place. And h e gave us chocolate; he gave us the best food we could ever \u2013 I could never remember ; and we were really hungry.

And they \u2013 they took them by \u2013 by the hundreds, you know, load them on trucks, to \u2013 to bury them. I got caught \u0160 typhoid, which I didn\u2122t know it was. I had a high fever, and I had a loose stomach. And h ere , this American soldier touched me, and he said I have a hot \u2013 very hot, cold, something \u0160 temperature, a very high tempera ture ; and took me to hospital in Schwandorf [Schwandorf in Bayern]. That\u2122s where it happened, close to Schwandorf. Interviewer: Schwandorf is where you were liberated? Irving Ha ss: That\u2122s where I was liberated. I didn\u2122t know when the war ended.

I did n\u2122t know at time \u0160 they cut me the fever off, and they brought me back to my weight. And I really \u2013 I could see in pictu res after that I was completely \u2013. And a fter that, they let me loose , and I started home looking for my family. And I was seeing lists were comin g out all over, and I traveled to M\u00fcnchen; and then I w ind up in Frankfurt where I met some of my townspeople with an American soldier.

Our grandmother died, his \u2013 his \u2013 his mother. And we had a special room made for him. And about five years ago, some of friends from her e went to Romania from New York, and c alled me up and says: You know, your house is still standing where you lived . We lived right across the street from the police department. And my \u2013 our house was new. And I \u2013 I would say, we must have been about five years old when we were took away from the Germans.

Irving Hass: I would say I ha ve to help out with \u2013 with my mother, you know, and with the sisters . We got prepared when \u2013 when Satur day came \u0160 the Sabbath, we \u2013 we couldn\u2122t do any work. She had to cook Friday fo r \u2013 for the \u2013 for the meal for Saturday and everything was put in the oven. You know, and \u2013 and like you say \u0160 you didn\u2122t have a \u2013 have a wooden stove, and you burned wood to ma ke the heat in the house \u0160 you know, not modern heat. Interviewer: What did you want to be when you grew up? Irving Hass: My father always said to me \u0160 you\u2122re going to be a lawyer. And to be a lawyer, I did not have enough schooling when I came to this country. I probably could \u0160 I had to go first to learn English. Then from going from the fifth grade to start going to college, and I could have probably been a lawyer. And h e was always saying, you know: This is a lawyer. I was good in school. And I was so \u0160 to give 18 you a thing that happened \u0160 I had a \u2013 a teacher in Hebrew school. He was so strict , and he was threateni ng. He was threatening that he wa s going to tell our father that we were bad. Four boys of us, me and two other boys, run awa y. That time we ru n away back to another town which is Petrova [Petreve] , which is about eight miles , you know; we run away. We went into a barn, and it was thundering and raining and storming, and they couldn\u2122t believe; and they were looking for us \u0160 all over town s and eve rything. And finally they found us and : What are you doing here? We we re crying \u0160 four of my friends , and he says \u2013 and he says : The father threaten \u2013 the teacher threatened us to tell the father that we were not studying what he \u2013 he taught us. So t hat\u2122 s why we run away. And they \u2013 and they found us, and we sorry as the day that never happened; we ru n away. Interviewer: Why did he threaten to tell th at story? Irving Hass: He threatened to tell them \u2013 he was threaten us to tell our fathers that we were no good this week in school because we didn\u2122t do our homework. Interviewer: Is that true? Did you do your homework that week? Irving Hass: We didn\u2122t do it; we \u2013 we goofed off. Interviewer: You goofed off? Irving Hass : We we re playing similar to baseball with a stick and throwing to a ball. And w e were afraid, for the father was strict. He w as going to give me a punish that you don\u2122t get this and so on. Interviewer: Strict father. And you were a good student. Were you a good student because your father was str ict? Irving Hass: The f ather was \u2013 was \u2013 I would say, yes. Today I would say yes; I could never forget my father. I repeat and think my father\u2122s wo rds. My mother was just plain , but my father \u2013. My mother was a soft woman, really quiet , you know, in ever ything, you know. I remember the day when I said I\u2122m \u2013 I\u2122m sorry some days I said \ufb01no\ufb02 to my mother. I wanted to go to my friend; and s he asked me for something, and I was going to my friend. I didn\u2122t obey her, and then I came home ; I was sorry. I says : I\u2122m sorry what I did. She says: Okay, we g et it done anyway. She aske d me to do a job or something. In \u2013 in today\u2122s date, I\u2122m \u2013 I\u2122m thinking the word s why \u2013 why I didn\u2122t obey her. Sometimes it come to you. Interviewer: If th e war hadn\u2122t happened \u2013? Irving H ass: If the war wouldn\u2122t happen, I would probably be a lawyer. 19 Interviewer: You would have continued schooling? Irving Hass: Continue school and I would have been there, like to live on and go to higher education. Interviewer: Where would you have gone to school? Irving Hass: In the \u2013 in the school would \u2013 would be gone is right in Sighet [Sighetu , Maramaros Sighet, M \u00e1ramarossziget, S ighetul Marmatiei, Sigut, Sihat, Syhot Marmaroski, Sziget] which is a big city of M\u00e1ramaros [Maramure , or Satu Mare [Sakmir, Saktmar, Sathmar, S Szatmarnemeti] . Satu Mare was another big \u0160 which a lot of people there. Interviewer: So you would have gotten your law degree and then \u2013? Irving Hass: I \u2013 I would have been a lawyer, yes. I was the only boy in the family, and they were really treating me \u2013 I was thinkin g right now. With five sisters, to be one boy because my brother died , and he was really \u2013 my mother and father was really \u2013 take preference on him. Interviewer: What was your younger brother\u2122s name? Irving Hass: Heschel. Interviewer: Heschel. So you would have become a la wyer , and would you have remained in Ruscova? Irving Hass: I would probably; I don\u2122t know where I would remain, but Ruscova was no t the place for a lawyer. Maybe Poian which is further up, another town there, would be more industrialized , would be for a lawyer. Interviewer: Now, y ou must have, as the oldest, watched your sisters grow up. Irving Hass: I watched my sisters , and I really liked my sisters , you know. And I always separated , sometimes, they \u2013 they were fighting. The little one , you know, were always going where the big one is going. I\u2122m talking to Hudia [sp, ph?] , you know.

There was always a fight , and I was the only boy. I couldn\u2122t mix in , you know; but I sti ck up \u201acause I like my sister. I really sti ck up with my sisters. Really, during the war, I co uldn\u2122t believe from five sister, one sister, her fri ends \u0160 about ten friends from her class survived. Tape One, Side B Five friends of her survived and they came to the United States. I couldn\u2122t Irving Hass: \u2013 believe my sister was close to the mother and they would not want to separate. Interviewer : What did your oldest sister want to be? Irving Hass: This I don\u2122t know. My oldest sister was \u2013 you know girls at that time ; s he wanted to go to school and probably be a \u2013 a teacher , she wanted \u2013 or to make instructing how to sew or something, what \u2013 what ever .

He did not have \u2013 not one man from \u2013 from Romania, which I know, went to concentration camp. All the Jews survived were only the Romanians.

Irving Hass: They had \u2013 t he minute the Hungarians came in , and they started goi ng against the Jews and hitting; the local people, the Ukrainians, started painting things and 21 calling names and finding, you know. W hen Christmas came , we couldn\u2122t even go out the street because they say we killed Jesus. Interviewer: These are the Ukrainians now? Irvin g Hass: Yeah . And w hen C hristmas came , they were dressing up and to go with bells, you know, like on Christmas Eve. And we were afraid to go out of the house because at that time they were really going and really beat you up or something. Interviewer: What about the Romanian s? Irving Hass: The Romanians, we didn\u2122t have too much problems. Interviewer: No \u2013 no problems?

She was playing the piano in our school, and we used to surround her, teaching us whatever , you know; and \u2013 and I would say that under \u2013 the \u2013 he was the \u2013 the kai \u2013 the \u2013 the king, what\u2122s his name? Interviewer: C arol? Irving Hass: C arol, yeah. And he was \u2013 wasn\u2122t \u2013 maybe later on there was som ething in the Romanians; maybe in deep \u2013 in deep Romania.

Interviewer: And your father d id a ll \u2013 did well in the business? 22 Irving Hass: My father made a living in the business. And he was working for a company was not from \u2013 not far from Romania. And this was mostly shipping material. You see, the town where I \u2013 where I lived \u0160 ten miles was a big lumber. They cut lumbers you know like in Washington, the state of Washington. And from this lumber \u2013 lumbering business is big business. He built materials at home.

I remember you were saying you had finished class, but before you could continue school in the f all \u2013 Irving Hass: There was no more school. 23 Interviewer: There was no more school, because of the Hungarians \u2013 Irving Hass: They came in, that\u2122s correct. Interviewer: You would have been fourteen, fifteen years old at the time. Do you remember the reaction of your family the day the Hungarians came in? Irving Hass: Oh, my \u2013 my father sai d that time , he didn\u2122t like it. And h e says right away that they going to be tied in to the Nazis \u0160 and they alre ady tied in to the \u2013 to the Germans. My father knew the Germa ns because in the factory where he was working, there was this college graduate \u0160 and a doctor, and the son was a doctor; he was very friendly with the president of the plant. And the son was a doctor, and he was say ing already what \u2013 what \u2013 what to be reading papers and listening to news . They had broadcast radios and so on and the \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 this guy, the p resident \u2013 of other \u2013 of Hungary was a Mik l\u00f3s \u0160 what\u2122 s his name \u0160 Mikl\u00f3 shy [sp, ph?]? Interviewer: Horthy. Irving Hass: Horth y, Horthy \u0160 yes. Horthy was tied in to the Germans. And \u2013 and he\u2122s say ing it\u2122s not going to be good. And my father foresee that. Interviewer: So y our father had some idea of how bad the German s might be? Irving Hass: How bad the Germans might \u2013, right. Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. Did he have any trust in the Hungarians; as someone who had fought in the Hunga rian army-? Irving Hass: No, th e Hungarians occupied Romania. They took some houses away from us and put into the \u2013 to the \u2013 they put the \u2013 the troops, you know, to station there. They slept in some homes. Interviewer: They took some of your property away? Irving Hass; Not of our property, they took some other \u2013 other homes. Interviewer: Other homes, but not your house? Irving Hass: Not my house. They took some other homes where it was convenience . We were near to th e \u2013 to the police, and that maybe saved us. Interviewer: Yeah, yeah. But your father, who had been in the Hungarian army, had been born a Hungarian citizen \u0160 he was afraid of becoming a part of Hungary? 24 Irving Hass : That\u2122s correct. My father kno w what \u2013 what was up to. He couldn\u2122t believe it whe n \u2013 when they came in , and he saw right away. He already spoken to my mother. W henever he wanted us not to understand, he was speaking Hungarian in the house, you know, so we don\u2122t understand what they were thinking. And \u2013 and I know we did n\u2122t . And then my father was talking to his friends, you know, and so on. I know he\u2122s going his friends, and t hey were talking politics \u0160 what\u2122s gonna happen . And he said it doesn\u2122t look good, and he didn\u2122t believe that this Hungarian is gonna sell us down to the \u2013 to the Nazis completely. That Horthy did that. Interviewer: Yeah. So that when your father, your family , spoke Hungarian, it was not out of love, but just for \u2013 Irving Hass: Just before they were educated and they spoke the language. Intervie wer: Yeah, yeah. What else happens after the Hungarians come in? Do you remember things that happened? Irving Hass: They picked certain peop le, like I said before , which they needed for labor camp. Interviewer: Young men? Irving Hass: Young men. To \u2013 then they were working and building defense lines. And I remember they were building in from big lumber trees and making that a tank could not go through \u0160 with holes, you know, like zigzagging . And then they come back , working on the day; and come back. So did my father. They took him certain days ; he couldn\u2122t go to work. Interviewer: So sometimes you father was drafted to work? Irving Hass: D rafted to work ; and so \u2013 and then all of a sudden, they take the younger guys, and they transfer them to Ukraine. Interviewer: But not your father? Irving Hass: Not my father. Interviewer: Did he continue working in the lumber? Irving Hass: He continued \u2013 he continued working both ways, where they took him. Wherever a day free, he went back to work wher ever he can . But when they took the young er guys to Ukraine, and then we fou nd out that they were \u2013 they killed them there. Before even we heard they resist the Nazis. In Ukraine, they killed a 25 lot of people, and we \u2013 we heard about i t from some \u0160 and what you call this; like people come back and escapes and so on . Interview er: You were too young for this? Irving Hass: I was too young to go and work in a labor wit h a pick and shovel. I was only a kid. Interviewer: What else happened to you? Irving Hass: They gave us ration s because we didn\u2122t have food. They \u2013 they already restrict us on food what we could eat. Interviewer: So you had rationing already? Irving Haas: You couldn\u2122t get certain \u2013 certain commodity . The Jews would not get it. Interviewer: What about school? Irving Hass: I \u2013 I didn\u2122t go to school.

Interviewer: What about your sisters? Irving Hass: Neither did th ey go to school. Interviewer: So even the youngest stopped going to school? Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: Do you remember why that was so? Irving Hass: I think the teachers weren \u2122t there. Th e \u2013 the teacher s from Romania went \u2013 went back or something. They had no teachers in my \u2013 in \u2013 in my town. Interviewer: Uh huh. So Romanian teachers left? Irving Hass: The Romanian \u2013 a ll the teachers left. There was no Hungarian \u2013 Romanian teachers. 26 Interviewer: So school closed? Irving Hass: School for the Jewish people \u0160 were no schools. We were going just to cheder \u0160 Hebrew school. Interviewer: Were there any Hungarian teachers, Hungarian schools? Irving Hass: I don\u2122t \u2013 nothing I could remember. Interviewer : What about movements? You know \u0160 you \u2122re walking in public? Irving Hass: Walking in public; I could walk maybe a mile. We were close to the synag ogue. And w e were comple tely restricted like to go; we couldn\u2122 t go no place. I couldn\u2122t travel to a different town.

Whatever \u2013 whatever mo \u2013 mother grew in the garden, we were eating . And w hatever corn we would have ; we would have every morning \u0160 cornmeal. To make it with boil ing water, cornmeal, we had a mill which grinded corn. From corn to make flour. So in the morning that\u2122s all I remember sin ce I was \u0160 I would say, since I \u2013 I \u2013. The\u2013 the Romanians were not \u2013. That \u2122s all we had was cornmeal for breakfast. Intervi ewer: Cornmeal. Irving Hass: Cornmeal \u0160 you mak e it with water, and it boils; you mix it in. they call it, okay. In Romania, they call it so we had every morning and milk. And t he only way we co uld get milk is to know some of these people in town. Some of these Ukrainian people. I don\u2122t know what you call it, Ukrainian there I remember the word what you called that people. And the m ilk we used to get from cows, and we milk it right. Or w e had our own cows.

Irving Hass: They couldn\u2122t work, correct. 27 Interviewer : Too young to get married? Irving Hass: They\u2122re tree \u2013 they\u2122re children. Interviewer: No school? Irving Hass: No school and they were just educ ating themselves whate ver they could get a hold of and read. Interviewer: Were there \u2013 were the Jewish schools \u0160 did they expand in any way, during this period? Irving Haas: The Jewish school ex \u2013 expanded but they mostly concentrate on boys. Interviewer: Boys, yes. Irving Hass: Girls were very limited time to go to \u2013 to school \u0160 to Hebrew school. They was concentrated mostly on boys. Interviewer: Yeah. Did you r family ever consider leaving? Irving Hass: The only one would consider leaving , he says, where would we go? My father used to say, you\u2122re going to \u0160 if you leave, you have another problem. You don\u2122t know nobody, and you got the same thing all over again. Especially you got a \u2013 you got a mark on yourself \u0160 you\u2122re Jewish. That\u2122s t he minu te he said, r ight away, you\u2122re Jewish, you \u2013 you identified yourself. So you can\u2122t go . If you want to go to Budapest, want to go to Bucharest, you couldn\u2122t. At that time, I don\u2122t know how strictly the borders were, and I would say the borders were strict. But there were still packages coming in. Only Czechoslovakia was free. Interviewer: Until the Nazis came? Irving Hass: \u201aTil the Nazis. But I\u2122m talking free from America to get mail . I know my uncle was shipping packages. Interviewer: Your uncle in America? Irving Hass: In America \u0160 shipping packages to us. We could not receive it in Romania; we could not receive it in Hungary \u0160 only Czechoslovakia. And they had to go \u0160 I remember my father had to go about 40 miles \u0160 to go with a wagon. A guy would take him to go into the Czech o \u2013 into Czechoslovakia, which is \u2013 was against \u0160 he smuggled in to get the package. And i n the package w as clothes \u0160 whatever they got . I remember peanut butter \u0160 which I nev er had peanut butter 28 in my life; and h ere comes a package an d two jars of peanut butter. This was a delicacy when we got it. Oh my God, we were fighting. The clothes \u2013 [Note Interviewer and Irving are talking over each other.] Interviewer: Your uncle in America, the uncle in America \u0160 he\u2122s your \u2013 on your \u2013 father\u2122 s side. Irving Hass: Father\u2122s side \u2013 Interviewer: Father\u2122s brother. Irving Hass: Yeah. Shipped it to an address in Trbou\u0131any [Note This Czechoslovakian town is way more than 40 miles from Ruscova. Ruscova is at a far distance from Czechoslovakia; Ruscova i s closer to Ukraine where there is a town called Trebu\u0131any. It is more likely to be able to be smuggled into Ukraine in a night than into Czechoslovakia.] I remember the \u2013 the town. Trbou\u0131any was Cze choslovakia, and that\u2122s why we had to go and pick up the package . And p ick up the package at a \u2013 at night \u0160 ge t yourself smuggled into Czechoslovakia; across the border and bring in th e package. If you get caught, you probably be shot. Inter viewer: How long did this go on \u0160 this \u2013 life? Irving Hass: This was go ing on for about, I would say, eight to ten months, a year. Interviewer: So the Hungarians come in. The \u2013 Irving Hass: The Hungarians came in, was already \u2013 we already almost converted to Nazism then . The Hungarians were with the Nazis. But the Hung arians with \u2013 had with them \u0160 Hungarian soldiers were with about three or four special Nazi G auleiters with them already. They were planning what was going to happen to us. Interviewer: Now w hen \u2013 when i s the ghettoization? When was the \u2013 the yellow st \u2013 badges and \u2013 and the \u2013 the story that you began w ith the \u0160 the, you know, the cattle car and the trains ? Irving Hass: The yellow badges was coming on already when the Hungarians came in with the \u2013 with a bunch of Nazis, what are called Nazi soldiers. And th ey were trying to identify us. If you want ed to go out of the house, you couldn\u2122t have out of the house without a yellow badge and star. Another thing, the Jewish girls were making this, and they looked nice decorated on their clothes. You know, everything we would look and something, you know, and all of a sudden a nice yellow star is \u2013 is on the dress , or on the jacket \u0160 sewed on; and is decorated. 29 And this is just to understand it between the townspeople. Our townspeople \u0160 to \u2013 to know who is who. Inter viewer: When did you first see Germans \u0160 in Ruscova? Irving Hass: The Germans \u0160 I saw them with the \u2013 with the Hungarians. When they \u2013 when they marched into our town with the \u2013 with the Hungarian army \u0160 with horses; with all kind of tanks \u0160 all kind of cannons, vehicles. You \u2013 oh my God, we were scared to death , you know, from the windows looking how the soldiers walking in with this armament. And then with \u2013 with the Hungarians, they were marching in. But there, already , was with each unit, was already a German assigned to them. Interviewer: Were you ever forced to move out of your house? Irving Hass: \u201at il they came us and took us away. Interviewer: \u201a til the spring of \u201a44? [ Note previous transcription has \u212242, but it is difficult to really discern what is on the tape. A ccording to many documents, Germans came to this area of Romania in 1944.] Irving Hass: They only took away \u2013 only took away certain homes where \u2013 where they wanted to have their headquarters. Interviewer: So there was no ghetto in Ruscova? Irving Hass: In \u2013 in \u2013 in Ruscova, right away they took us to ( Felshevisho, Ober Visho, Ober Wisho, Oyber Visheve, Vishya, Viso). [ Note First transcription has this as Wishov. Second transcription note s this as Vitsyuv. However, Vitsyuv is in the Ukraine and is further from Ruscova than th e distance Irving Hass having a ghetto.] And \u2013 and \u2013 and \u2013 and there \u2122s \u0160 the ghetto was in But I was lucky; we were at least eight, ten days there ; and they took our transport. That \u2122s where the ghetto . But t hey march us about 30 miles. Everybody, you know, walking; we had to walk 30 miles \u0160 whatever baggage we had. Interviewer: So from Ruscova to you had to walk? Irving Hass: Had to walk. And f rom there \u0160 where a railroad car ; ther e was a railroad already. Interviewer: And h ow much time did you have to get ready for this trip? 30 Irving Hass: Time \u0160 was not even maybe four, five hours. They just came. You in this area \u0160 wherever we were , there in the ghetto \u0160t here was a ghetto. Wha t you call this a ghetto or a \u2013 a \u2013 a \u2013. They took from so many towns; there must have been thousands of \u201aem, you know. And they \u2013 they were all in transport. Interviewer: Yeah. Irving Hass: So we from Ruscova \u0160 we were st aying in one area. Interviewer: In \u2013 in Irving Hass: In the we ge t in one area. When the transport came, we were going in the transport. Interviewer: I mean in \u2013 in Ruscova. Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: When in Ruscova, you\u2122re told to go to Vitsyuv [ Note Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: How much time did you have to get ready for that trip \u0160 for the walk? Irving H ass: For the walk, was three \u2013 maybe two days. Interv iewer: Two days to walk there. And what did your family take? The whole family\u2122s together \u2013 Irving Hass: I don\u2122t \u2013 I only remember my father had a valise , and my mother had a valise ; and we had absolutely nothing \u0160 the children. Interviewer: And the children walked? Irving Hass: Whatever \u2013 yeah \u2013 Interviewer: All the children walked? Irving H ass: Yeah, all of us. Whatever \u2013 whatever my father had in the valise, I would say, he might have some dollars \u0160 because my uncle, when every time he send a letter, there was a twenty. Because I remember as a kid \u2013 as a kid, I open a book, a nd I found there tw o twenties \u0160 American twenty -dollar bills. And I see to my father \u0160 he says, you know, he ha s to go to change it \u0160 to Vitsyuv [Note probably . You know, we had to go and trade. You couldn\u2122t spend it, you got to get \u0160 but there was people , you know, who was dealing with it. And h e had to trade 31 them in. But when my uncle sent a letter \u0160 was a twenty -dollar bill. He sent it for my grandfather ; for my father. And m y grandfather, I told was like this [?] \u0160 spen d; because he used to get a twenty dollar bill. I know when Passover came, he sent us money for wine. You know, before all this happened, and buying wine and so on \u0160 everything to prepare for the Passover. Interviewer: So you\u2122re walking to the \u2013 to \u2013 to Vitsyuv [Note probably and all you have are the two suitcases . And who is pushing you to walk; t hese are Hungarian police? Irving Hass: Hung \u2013 Hung \u2013 no, t here was Hungarian and what you call \u0160 Ukraines. Interviewer: Ukrainians \u2013 Hungarian and Ukrainian guards. Irving Has s: Guar ds. And in Vitsyuv , [ Note we already had Germans there, completely staffed with Germans, directing to get loaded in the railroad cars. Interviewer: And it took you two days to \u2013 to get there and , of course, nobody kne w what was going to happen next. Irving Hass: We didn\u2122t know. Maybe my father knew they were going to transport us someplace , but he didn\u2122t know ther e \u2013 there is a crematorium. But when \u2013 when I sat , we were on the railroad car already , traveling nights, a couple of night s or so on, and he says we\u2122re in Poland. And m y father recognized , when, you know, he traveled that by train \u2013 so. And all of a sudden we found ourselves in Auschwitz, and we get out \u0160 open the doors in Auschwitz in the morning ; \u201about ten , eleven o\u2122 clock. And every railroad car , and my God, we saw thousands of people on the side. A nd \u2013 and these Germa ns with these whips and so on \u0160 left and right and left and right. Interviewer: Now, d uring the walk from Ruscova \u2013 Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: W ho were yo u walking with, you recall? Irving Hass: I was walking with my townspeople. Interviewer: I mean with anyone in particular? Irving Hass: I was walking with my father, and then was walking with three of our neighbors. And [ Note hear a lot of rustling of paper ] this particular girl was my neighbor, and the brother \u2013 here [Note hear a lot of rustling of paper] \u0160 Slomow itz [sp, ph] was his nam e \u0160 here. [Note hear a lot of rustling of paper] He\u2122 s my age ; this is 32 the sister and brother \u0160 in New York. We were walki ng all together. But I did not get in the same transport. Interviewer: No, no. I\u2122m \u2013 we\u2122re \u2013 we\u2122re still look \u2013 looking now at the walk. [Note Interviewer and Irving Hass are talking over each other.] Irving Hass: The walk, we were walking the entire \u2013 Interview er: Do you remember talking or being silent? Irving Hass: Talking \u0160 no you couldn\u2122t talk. You surely talked to each other \u0160 in Yiddish , and these guys were just march and keep on going. But you couldn\u2122t \u2013. I think they \u2013 they took the entire town in one time. Three hundred of families from Ruscova was marched out on the same day. Interviewer: And then how many days did you spend in Vitsyuv ? [ Note probably Irving Hass: In Vitsyuv [Note , I would say maybe two or two and a half. And I did not come all of us on the same transport. That\u2122s why t hey segregated us, and some what happened, maybe in different barracks or something. I remember we \u2013 I was, from my town, from the Vitsyuv [Note , must have been at least \u2013 . Even my cousins, him did not come on my transport which is my \u2013 my mother\u2122s \u0160 my \u2013 my aunt. Interviewer: Mother\u2122s brother? Irving Hass: My mother\u2122s \u2013 my mother\u2122s \u2013 Interviewer: Brotherin-law? Irving Hass: Brotherin-law \u0160 didn\u2122t come on the same transport. He came two days later. So I\u2122m \u2013 I have a memorial \u2013 that every \u2013 I know in the Jewish, after the d eath, you got to know when your father died, you have a date. My date \u0160 I took the day arrived in Auschwitz. Interviewer: Do you remember the date? Irving Hass: The date arrived in Auschwitz I would say is \u2013 is in \u2013 in the month of May. So I\u2122m taking it to maybe May \u2013 May \u2013 May 12 th to 14th. Whenever a Jewish holiday comes out in May, I\u2122m taking \u0160 we call ed it like b\u00e4um en [sp, ph] in Jewish [Note beymer is Yiddish for trees], this is a tree day. Trees is planted, and I took that day for mine \u2013. Because when I know they came to Auschwitz, they 33 had no \u2013 not two days even left over. They undressed th em right away naked , and they \u2013 and they \u2013 and they feed them to the ovens. Interviewer: Now who put you on the train in were the Hungarians and Ukrainians again? Irving Hass: No, there w as alre ady Germans. Interviewer: Germans. Irving Hass: Germans with the Hungarians bu t the Germans were completely \u2013 Interviewer: In command? Irving Hass: In command. They were tell ing what railroad car and they \u2013 everything is gotten in railroad cars. Interviewer: Were you able to eat anything when you were in Vitsyuv ? [ Note Irving Hass: In they gave us \u0160 one meal , I remember, is bread. And they had a soup or something. And p eople which have in the \u2013 smuggled in the \u0160 you know there was people, when they ca me from \u2013 Interviewer: Carrying food. Irving Hass: Carrying food ; and maybe my father and mother had some food in there. Interviewer: Yeah; that\u2122s why I was a sking you whet her they \u2013 Irving Hass: So I think, in the valise, for my sisters. I know my mother was \u2013 was given something to eat. But when we were in the railroad cars, we didn\u2122t have nothing to eat. And th at thing was really \u2013 which I have known for a f act \u0160 people were crying and drinking their urine \u0160 children. Interviewer: Your family was in one car? Irving Hass: We were all in one car. Interviewer: The other people in the car were from the town? Irving Hass: Also, there were about three or four famil ies in the town. There was other people from Leordina [?], from different town s. Interviewer: So you knew a lot of the people that were in the railroad car? 34 Irving H ass: So I would say I knew \u2013 about \u2013 I would say about more \u2013 more than eight or ten people from the \u2013 from the same town was in that car. Inte rviewer: In that car ; plus your family. Irving H ass: My family. And I \u2013 I would say because we didn\u2122t \u2013 and they were so tight in the car; and I\u2122m not kidding you. Pain [?] from standing; we were just sitting down on top of each other. And \u2013 and c ramped in there ; and when we were hearing someb ody scre aming , and there were the SS \u0160 riding on top of the cars and the si de of the cars. Each car got a \u2013 . You see, when \u2013 when from , the transport came in \u0160 no more Hung arian. Were all German troops \u201a til you hit Auschwitz. Interviewer: On the train? Irving Hass: On the train. They were already in command to take on guards on the train \u0160 everything. Interviewer: You still have you r suitcases \u2013 insid e the train? Irving Hass: Inside the train, yes. But not too \u2013 too many people had the suitcases. They didn\u2122t take away anything for you from the ghetto. Whatever you carried with us; if you ca n\u2122t drag it , you drag it. In Auschwitz, ther e was the unpacking. Because when I said when I saw the things, you know, from the Nuremberg Trial \u0160 that booklet, and that showed how \u2013 how they unloaded people; and they had everything to get undressed. People had dollars or diamonds \u0160 whatever \u0160 sewed i n. All of them were taken away. And then they cut their hair. And t hey were even saving the hair to make mattresses or something. Interviewer: Now in the \u2013 in the cattle car \u0160 who were you sitting with? Do you remember \u2013? Irving Hass: I was \u2013 Interviewer: \u2013 what it was like? Irving Hass: I was sitting in the cattle car mostly next to \u2013 was her father . Th is girl was also in the cattle car with me. Interviewer: Friends y our age? Irving Hass: That was my age , and \u2013 and she died of tuberculosis; this what I\u2122m saying. Interviewer: Yeah. Did \u2013 did you talk much? Was it \u2013 was the train quiet or was it noisy? 35 Irving Hass : I wasn\u2122t able what to talk; I didn\u2122t kn ow what to talk. I was talking oh my God \u0160 I hear the people were crying. Food, we were thinking of food. Interviewer: So if you h ad to describe what it was like \u0160 crying? Irving Has s: We were crying all the way. We were crying and yelling , and \u2013 and really saying : Why did God do this to us? Interviewer: Yeah. So crying \u2013 yelling. Irving Hass; And \u2013 and y ellin g, something that said: I need \u2013 I want a drink ; I \u2013 I\u2122m dying. And c ertain people were \u2013 were actually squashed there. I know for a fact there was a couple of people dead on the car which I don\u2122t know. Interviewer: Two people died there. Irving Hass: Two or three people in the car. Interviewer: Any food \u0160 no food at all? Irving Hass: We didn\u2122t get any food. Interviewer: Toilet facilities \u0160 nothing? Irving Hass: No toilet facilities. Even the windows were with \u2013 with wires. Interviewer: So it was dark insi de? Irving Hass: Dark inside, we had no light. When all of the sun , you\u2122 re getting up , but the people \u0160 the men mostly \u0160 my father i s \u2013 was right by the window \u0160 see what \u2122s going on. And I was right next to him; staying to \u2013. He \u2013 he was lucky; when he got in, he got to a window. And b y the window he was seeing what\u2122s going on , and he was telling us. He says: We are \u2013 He figured it out right away \u0160 we\u2122re in Poland. He recognized the Poland because the train had t o stop to water up the engines. And he saw these \u2013 these things, you know. \u201aCause I couldn\u2122t see anything, you know. Dare and I begged to \u2013 I like d to see it ; he couldn\u2122t even lift me up. And try to go three, four days in a car; we have no light, and you don\u2122t \u2013 you can\u2122t see what\u2122s going down outsi de. My father could \u2013 could see in the windows, and the other people could see in the windows. And then we were so glad when we opened up the car in Auschwitz \u0160 oh my God. And they told us that time: Oh you\u2122re going to go \u2013 \u0160 Arbeit Mach t Frei, they have a ll these signs in Auschwitz. Interviewer: What\u2122s the first thing you saw when they opened the car? 36 Irving Hass: Germans \u0160 lined up. And s ome other cars were unloaded already. And o ur car got unloaded; ther e was five or ten cars in front. People \u0160 oh my God \u0160 holding their children on their hand. And \u2013 and they were with whips and sticks \u0160 you name it. You kno w to \u2013 to get a sample, each rail road car had to be in the right \u2013 right assemble in the front of the car; and then they were marching them off right t o the camp through the gates. Interviewer: As you got out of the car, your family stayed together? Irving Hass: Mine daughter \u2013 mine \u0160 I say, my sisters would not leave the mother. That\u2122s why not one survived. You see, if they would\u2122ve separated from their mother to be individual, you know, they would probably have the whip to go to the left too, because the \u2013 the kid looked real good, you know, not undernourished \u0160 my sisters, you know. And they would go; but the other girls \u2013 M y sister\u2122s friend which gave me the other picture, she said : I separate from my mother. They put me a way when they unloaded me in the car. I didn\u2122t know where my mother was. And m y sisters all sti ck to the mother. They holding hands when they got off the railroad car. Interviewer: All of them walking? Nobody being carried? The little girl walking? Irving Hass: Everyone. They not allowed to carry anything. The little one even walked. And the last time I saw my family, un \u2013 we unloaded. And I can\u2122t forget it \u201atil this date . The unloading of Auschwitz \u0160 that\u2122s the last day I saw my family. Interviewer: Your father \u0160 was he still with your mother? Irving Hass: M y father with my mother , together with the five sisters. Interviewer: So they were all sent together? Irving Hass: All sent togeth er. And I know for a fact, they we re burned the same week or the same day when they arrived. Because my sister would \u2122ve been survived if they would be separated. My sister was an aggressive girl \u0160 the big one, S heindel [sp, ph?] . Interviewer: Sheindel. Irving Hass: Yeah. She was an aggressive girl like that; I couldn\u2122t believe it. When I met this \u2013 her friends in New York after liberation, I met one in New York, and one in \u2013 in \u2013 in Frankfurt , and they said: Maybe S heindel is alive. And I start, still corr esponding and finding from HIA S, Red Cross; and all of them, even a fter I was in the United States \u0160 couldn\u2122t find any. 37 Interviewer: So Sheindel is the most aggressive \u0160 the strongest girl in your family? Irving Hass: The strongest girl from all of them, s he was a really aggressive. Loved the mother \u0160 I\u2122m telling you \u0160 always, just like , you know, for mom and everything, you know. And she didn\u2122t want to separate. And the kid did not know where they going; they want to be together as a family. Interviewer: How would you describe the other girls? Irving Hass: The other girls we re the same , but they \u2122re not so more attached, because , you know, she is the \u2013 she was the leader. The othe r was \u2013 the othe r one was a follower. Interviewer: So the other girls were f oll owing Sheindel? Irving Hass: Following what Sheindel \u0160 what she was doing. Whatever Sheindel was saying , the other kids were following \u0160 the other sister s. And they really \u0160 because I\u2122m \u2013 I\u2122m just saying \u0160 they were like a teacher, the big one. In \u2013 in home, they were al ways listening to \u0160 the \u2013 the sisters were listening to her. Interviewer: And as you got off the train, and you were walking and then getting separated, did anybody have any idea what was go nna happen? What did you think was gonna happen? Irving Hass: I didn\u2122t even know it was an oven. I didn\u2122t even know what Auschwitz was. Like I said before, they put me in a barrack in wooden shelves. That\u2122s \u2013 that\u2122s what we were sleeping \u0160 no mattress, no nothing. And the same clothes which I had as I cam e. Two days went by, and nothing happened. When I saw these people lined up outside, they were ready to go and to tattoo you. When I saw these people lined up, I ge t out of the barrack, and somebody didn\u2122t see me. I crawled out and formed in a line. People stay in line and f alled in, and \u2013 and here the y took us to a railroad ; and I\u2122m on a railroad car. My God, I sa ys: Where we going? Interviewer: You didn\u2122t know. Irving Hass: I\u2122m out of Auschwitz. That\u2122s the only\u0160 Interviewer: You knew that Auschwitz was a place to leave. Irving Hass: I didn\u2122t know wha t is going on in Auschwitz, but I see the people \u0160 pushcarts, and walking, Interviewer: You didn\u2122t want to stay. 38 Irving Hass: And I didn\u2122t want to stay. And I don\u2122t know what got into me. Th ere time, somebody came in and pushed me get out of that barracks and hang on to the transport. I was going right there and standing in the line; and there is all the counting. And the guy counts and says , March . And a ll of a sudden we start walking; we walk to a railroad. And we were \u2013 we loaded in railroad cars again and here in two days \u2013 [Interviewer and Irving Hass talking over each other.] Interviewer: Same kind \u2013 same kind of cars? Irving Hass: Same kind \u2013 same kind of railroad cars , and I\u2122m going wind up in \u2013 in that camp. Interviewer: Theresienstadt? Irving Hass: Theresienstadt. Interviewer: And when you got there, what was your impression? Irving Hass: When I got t here, then I saw \u0160 at least I know they\u2122re not going to kill us. They unloaded us, and they gave us some bread. And they gave us \u2013 Interviewer: Germans? Irving Hass: The Germans \u2013 some kind of a \u0160 what you call it \u0160 soup from \u2013 made from \u0160 cabbage soup. And I see somebody \u2013 we going to be somebody there, because they put us in clothes. They gave us the striped suits. I didn \u2122t have a striped suits in \u2013 in \u2013 in \u2013 in there.

Interviewer: Until you get i nto Theresienstadt. Irving Hass: That\u2122s what I\u2122m saying . Today\u2122s date, I cannot get away thinking what pushed me to get into that line. People w as telling me that they\u2122re in Auschwitz, they got into a line because they were tattooed and to go awa y. I was n ot tattooed, I was \u2013 Interviewer: Were you showered? Were you \u2013 your hair wasn\u2122t cut \u0160 nothing? 39 Irving Hass: Nothing was cut, and I was out from Auschwitz by \u2013 by sheer luck; to get into \u2013 All of the people there had tattoos and everything because I met them . They says : What\u2122s your number? I didn\u2122t want to say it. Interviewer: Do you know what just occurred to me?

Irving Hass: I \u2013 I was aggressive. Interviewer: You got on that line. Irving Hass; I was aggressive in stealing from \u2013 f rom \u2013 from under the wires; I went out at night. I could have been shot and killed to steal potatoes because I kn ow where the potatoes are during the day. I passed by, and they had the potatoes; and I came back in the barracks and shared it with my friend. I stole three potatoes and came, and we didn\u2122t have too much big pockets. And I bring into the barracks, and then we were eating raw potatoes ; and i t was like sugar. Interviewer: Do you ever wonder why you w ere aggressive , considering \u0160 I remember now \u0160 the story you told me? When you were a student, and you were afraid tha t your father was gonna punish you for being a bad student; now, then you we ren\u2122t aggressive. Right? Irving Hass: That\u2122s right, that\u2122s right. Interviewer: The change occurs. Does it oc cur during this trip? You had never been aggressive before? Irving Hass: Yes. It\u2122s \u2013 it\u2122s \u2013 it\u2122s \u2013 it\u2122s w hen I was already in Theresienst adt and that\u2122s the time \u2013 Interviewer: When you were alone? Irving Hass: Alone \u2013 I was figuring \u2013 I didn\u2122t \u2013 afraid for myself for that. I was not afraid for death. I was afraid , and this guy who was next to me, h e says : Don\u2122t do this . He says : We are good friends; you gonna get killed. He says: Why should I get killed with \u2013 with \u2013 the guy \u2122s going to kill yo u with the sti ck or something, or 40 with a gun? I want to see a full stomach. And I took chances, and everything was luck with me. Interviewer: Well, you could die without food too. Irving Hass: And I tell you , say and that was more luck when they took us out and shot \u2013 shot us out there. And then when I saw the American troops were parading the Germans in trucks to go and pick up these people; they took you, people go pick \u201aem up , and they couldn\u2122t get over \u0160 t he Germans \u0160 how many Jewish people were killed in that forest . We had to bring them down; they packed them like sardines. And I \u2013 to this day, when I was liberated, wher ever, I saw these trucks coming with these people on, and I said to myself, you know. And \u2013 and I could tell you \u0160 to live when I was marching in Flossenb\u00fcrg and so on, they were marching us. I wanted to drink water, and it was wet from the trucks, from the tires going there ; and there is water assembled. I didn\u2122t care if I die d or \u2013. I grab my fingers and grab water and drank. Interviewer: From the puddle? Irving Hass: From the puddle. And y ou know something; you learn something here from doctors. You could survive days if you have to have liquid in you. Interviewer: You need to have liquid. Irving Hass: You need to have liquid in you. Interviewer: That\u2122s right.

And I couldn\u2122t sleep , and it was ruining my stomach. And I went to doctors.

I says, I told him about from where I came ; he says: You give the nurse a dollar; whatever you can . You go out. He gave me more time tha n the guys who paid him $500, this Doctor Katz. And he said: You know, we found out, you don\u2122t have ulcers. I still have the paper in a box. Interviewer: What did you have?

And he says; he give me an example : You eat a pickle, a pickle is very hard to digest. I met my wife, I couldn\u2122t eat cream cheese and jelly , and chicken; you ask her. All these years I went with her, until this Dr. Katz gave me a certain diet and gave me medicine to eat up . He says : And the stomach will eat food to digest, the chemicals , and it becomes energy or whatever. He says : That lays in your stomach and doesn\u2122t digest in system. He gave me these pills , and all of a sudden I feel better. A month later he says : Oh Go d, you all right? And I come back; he says: You follow this. And then a month later I go back , and he says : Now, I said to him, we gonna have a good pastrami sandwich. And I \u2013. She says : God, you\u2122re gonna get sick again.

And I went back , and I said: I\u2122m Doctor \u2013 whatever you wish yourself, I double it for you, but you help me. And \u2013 and t hat guy helped me ; 50 \u2013 955 \u00bd [ Note probably means 555 \u00bd as above] is the address on Fifth Avenue. And that guy found out the problems.

Interviewer: You lived right inside the camp. What was it like? 42 Irv ing Ha ss: Flossenb\u00fcrg was segregated \u0160 wouldn\u2122t \u0160 no Flossenb\u00fcrg, I think, wa s also a camp that gassed people. And they had people in different barracks \u0160 for working. And I could tell you like I was an aggressive. I was hungry in Flossenb\u00fcrg, and the garbage cans were standing idle. I went to the garbage cans and picked up food and ate. Wherever I can, I \u2013 I \u2013 I \u2013 I did. I s always \u2013 I was for survival. Interviewer: Who was in your barrack s? What kind of people were in there? Irving Hass: People were \u2013 That\u2122s w hat I say; I met people from all over. Interviewer: All over.

Somewhat unintelligible] I saw; and we were working together. He says: Where are you? And he told me and what \u2013 Interviewer: What was a typical day like? Irving Hass: They woke us up six o\u2122clock in the morning, and they work from six right away \u0160 no matter roll call [? Somewhat unintell igible], to heat, to rain, shine.

Irving Hass: They gave us one \u2013 one meal there at work which is other like you say \u2013 They gave us that soup \u0160 was like gold to us \u0160 cabbage sou p \u2013 cabbage soup. Interviewer: Cabbage soup. Irving Hass: They put this cabbage, and they \u2013 they cooked it in water; and \u2013 and that\u2122s what we ate. And it was delicious \u0160 I tell you. When you\u2122re hungry, you eat it like everything. But \u2013 but when I was in the work, I was always obeying the orders \u0160 I should not get in trouble. I could not \u2013 one fellow who was work with me \u0160 he was, I think, from Poland \u0160 and I said : Listen, hold on to me, when we were marching. He said : I cannot march no more; that\u2122s it. And that\u2122s all I hear, poof. Everybody in the transport we were marching; they couldn\u2122t walk further, they killed you. And somebody picked \u201aem up. And I begged him: Hold on, let\u2122s go. And I \u2013 and \u2013 and he says: I can\u2122t do it no more. And I did whatever, you know, to get to survive. And that\u2122s one thing \u0160 my survival was the \u2013 was the \u2013 43 Tape Two , Side A Interviewer: Okay; w e were talking about \u2013 Irving Hass: Flossenb\u00fcrg. Interviewer: Flossenb\u00fcrg and a \u2013 and a typical day. And I think you were talking about the kapo. Irving Hass : Yeah, the kapo s; and another thing, too. Some of the kapos, which really bugged me in Flossenb\u00fcrg, was also one of ours. Interviewer: One of your k apos was \u2013 ? Irvi ng Hass: One of our own people. Interviewer: From Ruscova? Irving Hass: From \u2013. No, Poland. Interviewer: Polish \u0160 Jewish you mean. Irving Hass: Polish Jews was always on the kapo. And I couldn\u2122t get over one of our own \u2013 and our \u2013 one of our own would hit us. And t he reason \u0160 he prob ably ge t preference treatment from the Nazis. Interviewer: So your \u2013 your kapo was a Polish Jew? Or was \u2013 Irving Hass: Not m ine. Interviewer: No, nearby. Irving Hass: Near the other labor \u2013 labor kommandos was \u2013 was \u2013 was \u2013 B ecause when I find out, and t he guys were talking : You see this guy, he says we gonna beat him up or something. Okay, but it happens. But I \u2013 my kapo was a Ukrain e. Interviewer: Ukrainian kapo. Irving H ass: And he was worse than ever. Interviewer: Uh huh.

I don\u2122t know what kind, special made for this camp. You recognize right away that he\u2122s one of \u2013 . And w herever they \u2013 they were going with Germans, he and \u2013 and the Germans were with us together. Interviewer: Were you ever punished for any thing? Irving Hass: The only thing I was punished \u2013 is \u2013 was to stay in the cold for an hour and a half. And I thought I\u2122m not going to live through that. In Flossenb\u00fcrg , they mad e me stay wit h \u2013 with a pair of \u2013 the pajamas and sandals \u0160 stand for four ho urs. And I thought I\u2122m not gonna make it ; but I said to myself, I am gonna make it, and I\u2122m gonna make it, I \u2122m gonna make it. To myself \u0160 really just talking by myself. And the reason for this happened \u0160 he caught me with the \u2013 with the \u2013 not caught me ste aling. He caught in my pocket, a potato , and he asked me where did I get it. I says : I found it. And I [ Note probably means \u201ahe\u2122] says: Where did you get it? I says : I found it. Now w here did I find a potato \u0160 he has to find it on the floor. I didn\u2122t; which is how he caught me. Whe re did you find this potato? That really \u2013 he first gave me a couple \u201asss\u2122 \u2013 [ Note this is a sort of hissing sound.] with the sticks, you know. And then he says : Stay out there. Tomorrow morning you \u2122re going to stay ; and that\u2122s wh at it will \u0160 my punishment. Interviewer: What time of the year was this?

Interviewer: So i t was winter? Irving Hass: And t hat was cold , and I\u2122m telling you it was cold. Interviewer: Did y ou have newspapers under your clothing at that time? Irving Hass: At that time I didn\u2122t , because he grabbed me right away out. I always was telling my \u2013 my \u2013 my \u2013 my friends to g et yourself away from cold . Wherever they find \u2013 wherever they find a paper, wrap yourself around the paper. I don\u2122t know whe re \u2013 where \u2013 where it came to me \u0160 on my own mind. I tried it once, and the paper kept me warm. People were shivering. Interviewe r: This was after \u2013 ? 45 Irving Hass: This w as after, yeah. People were shivering, and t hat paper was really like \u2013 something in me. Interviewer: Did he \u2013 did you ever see him punish other people? Irving Hass: Yeah, yeah, yeah [? Slight ly unintelligible] . He was \u2013 he was \u2013 If a guy goes in sick or \u2013. And I used to tell the guys, I says: Don\u2122t you \u2013. He \u2013 t hey can\u2122t go on over to work ; the guy\u2122s in pain . Like he\u2122s saying, he calls in sick \u0160 not calls in [unintelligible] , he says to the gu y: I can \u2122t go \u0160 he sits down. They take him in the \u2013 in the \u2013 in the hospital; whatever they had. He used to \u0160 next time, we don\u2122t know where he is; never know where he is. Wh at they did to him? Interviewer: Did you see any executions? Irving Hass: Uh-huh. Hanging I saw a lot. In \u2013 in \u2013 in Theresienstadt, they always wanted to show what will happen. And they \u2013 they lined us up in \u2013 in hanging \u0160 about five or six of \u201a em at one ti me \u0160 hanging. Shoo \u2013 to shoot with a gun was an easy killing \u0160 which I saw quite a few of \u201aem. And then they had a lu ll [? unintelligible] in the carts. In Theresienstadt I was also in a k ommando with carts to \u2013 with frozen bodies. I handled the frozen bodies and helped them with the three of us. And used to bring them to a place and throw them into \u2013 into a ditch. They have dug a ditch , but \u2013. Interviewer: What did a person have to do to get hang ed in Theresienstadt? What was their crime? Irving Hass: He tried to run away or not to go \u2013 not to work. He ru n away , and they caught him, O K. I f they caught him, they bring him back , and they right away made \u2013. Quite a l ot of people wanted to escape; and this one thing \u0160 I did not want to escape. And I don\u2122t know what happened to me. The only thing that\u2122s absent [? unintelligible] from Ausc hwitz, I was going on transport; whenever I went to camp, I was not ready to escape; \u201acause I knew when you escape, they gonna get caught. You cannot be hidden. Interviewer: Well, where you gonna go? Irving Hass: Go. And another thing in the transport, the \u2013 the \u2013 the bombers used to go on over and over. And y ou see the dive bombers, diving against us. And we got s ome of us in the transport; they didn\u2122t know who we were and got killed. Interviewer: So, some American planes bombed your transport? 46 Irving Hass: They didn\u2122t know \u2013 they didn\u2122t know who it was; and by accident. B ut what it got m e \u0160 all the \u2013 the thing after the war I heard \u2013 no American bombers \u0160 they knowed the intelligence \u0160 couldn\u2122t bomb Auschwitz. They would have saved millions; it would have \u2013 so maybe a million Jews would have been killed, whoever was in Auschwitz. And they could have bombed it and destroyed the railroads. And t he railroad tracks were never destroyed. Interviewer: Was Flossenb\u00fcrg ever bombed? Irving Hass: Flossenb\u00fcrg was bombed during the minutes what you call the \u2013 during the end of the war w hen we already in the forest \u0160 they bombed it. But they didn\u2122t bomb it completely. They bombed it before the tracks. Interviewer: Because of the military action going by , nearby \u2013 Irving Ha ss: The military; y ou see, the military was already going . And t he Germans were already given up. Like I said \u0160 they shot us there and started escaping. I know the Third Army was the one who liberated \u2013 liberated me. And then a few days later, the war ende d. I think it was almost the end of April when I was liberated, and I was in the hospital. And then April, May \u2013 May something, May 8, I think, the war ended . Interviewer: Yes, yes. Irving Hass: Which I was in the hospital; and I found out the war ended. Interviewer: May seems to be a big month in your life. Irving Hass: May is a good month in my life because I was born in May. May, I was the last \u2013 I was caught in \u2013 in the \u2013 in the transport there. Interviewer: Yeah; but i t\u2122s also the month you went to A uschwitz. Irvin g Hass: Yes, and I \u2013 I \u2013 I\u2122m telling you it\u2122s Taurus they call it , and that\u2122s something. Interviewer: You\u2122re a Taurus? Irving Hass: Yeah. Interviewer: Now , at Flossenb\u00fcrg, we were talking about executions. Did you see hangings at Flossenb\u00fcrg? Irving Hass: Yes. Interviewer: Any body you kno w? 47 Irving Hass: I didn\u2122t know anybody what \u2013 what was hanged. So we kept \u0160 I said there were two different sections in Flossenb\u00fcrg . In Flossenb\u00fcrg, I didn\u2122t know why \u2013 why that was so sections. Q uite a camp \u0160 there in Flossenb\u00fcrg. And they had different type of labor set-up. Some of \u201a em were working in factories , and some of \u201a em were working on the roads and special projects. Interviewer: When you saw these executions, and you saw those people dying, did you think they were lucky, or they were unlucky? Irving Hass: Sometimes I think that they were lucky. When I was \u2013 I feeling downgraded, like I was so col d and hungry, I said: I wish I would be on the hanging list. And then in my mind came that , Oh no, i t\u2122s no t gonna go on forever; you gonna survive. And t hat \u2122s one thing \u2013 t wo \u2013 two things came to my mind \u0160 I \u2013 I wished I would be there, and then I thought to myself : Oh no, I\u2122m gonna survive . And I did survive. The mostly lucky day when I survived is that shoot ing in that forest. And to that day \u2122s day, I cannot forget. Interviewer: Saved by a tree? Irving Hass: Saved by a tree , and then to have typhus \u0160 people die of typhus \u0160 and survived. And when I was telling this to people, they couldn\u2122t believe that I had typhus in 1945 and survived because Sch wandorf there was a close hospital there. And a lucky soldier caught me , and get me to the hospital. I don\u2122t even know today \u2122s date who it was. Interviewer: Looking back \u0160 all this \u0160 what was your worst moment? Irving Hass: The worst moment is always thinking to myself, and thinking, it says : Why did this happen? There is no God. I said : I don\u2122t believe in any God, to myself. How can this be, to human beings to be like animals? We\u2122re catt le in the cattle cars , and that\u2122 s all I was thinking to myself; always thinking . And I says : If I ever survive , I said to myself, If I ever survive, I wan na make sure that this\u2122 ll never happen again ; and with everything I could do. And t his came out , and I bring it up in the army. I was drafted in the United States Army. I was transferred from Camp Gordon, Georgia to Camp Meade in Maryland, in Washington. We were working in a highly classified complex. And ther e was a \u2013 a Sergeant Willingham \u0160 very anti -Semitic \u0160 okay. And t here was a Jew ish holiday. The Jewish holiday came out from a Colonel Tullis \u0160 was his name. All Jewish personnel are accused for the Yom Kippur holiday. Interviewer: Ex \u2013 Excused. 48 Irving Hass: I mean excused \u2013 for the Yom Kippur holiday to go to pre serve the holidays. So I didn\u2122t know there w as two other Jews. All of a sudden I find two other Jews, one guy from Califo rnia and one guy from New York. One guy was Levin and one guy was Morris [sp, ph?]. Typewriter \u0160 they had a typewriter company. Sergeant Willingham comes out and says : Okay you Dutchman , to me, you are gonna work your butts off over the weekend to clean the warehouse. Entire window \u0160 which is a quarter of a mile long with windows in washing. We reported , and we cleaned the windows. And this guy Morris says to me: I\u2122m gonna get a box of nails. I\u2122m gonna put his tires; I\u2122m gonna fix him up. I said : Morris, you\u2122re not gonna put a nail so long as I am here. I am going to the colonel; tell him what happened. He wrote the orders, you know; shows you . And when I was telling this to my wife, I go to the sergeant; I says: I want to speak to the colonel. No, you go to the captain. I go to the captain, I says : Captain, I want to speak to the colonel. Can I help you? I says : Capta in, I\u2122m sorry; this is the colonel\u2122s probl em. The chain of command I went. He had to \u2013 to let me go. The captain tells me; he says : Irving \u2013 Hass , he called me, get yourself nice dressed -up. Make , sure your ties are right and \u2013 and you\u2122re authorized to see the colonel. The colonel was told I \u2122m coming ; I\u2122m coming in the office and salute; and says to th e colonel : Colonel, I got a personal problem. Mine frien ds did not have the guts to come to see you. And I tell him: Colonel, I am a survivor of the concentration camp. I was drafted in this United S tates Army , which is a nice country, and I love it, and I would die for it. What\u2122s the problem? I say s: Colonel, here is your order. I had a copy of it. You see, I\u2122m from the Jewish faith. You gave us permission to be excused from service \u2013 from the servic e company to go observe the Yom Kippur holiday which is a big holiday. He says: Oh yes, I know Yom Kippur. Sergeant Willingham, the following week, made me and my other two friends work in the warehouse cleaning windows for Sundays and Saturdays, two days, because of this. However, Colonel, my Jewish friends did wanna put nails under his tire and everything to get even with him. I said no; this got to be in the higher-up. That\u2122s all you have to do. The colonel says to: relax soldier and I\u2122m gonna tell you a story , he says to me. You sitting like this now, all relaxed. There is big fish in the ocean \u2013 small fish. Sometimes the big fish eats up the small fish. There is apples, beautiful apples in a basket. One apple in the middle all of a sudden is rotten . And this rotten basket touch es the other; the apple gets rotten. In this man\u2122s army, he said, there is good people, and there is bad people. Here we got a rotten apple. And h e tells me: Soldier, I\u2122ll take care of that. Soldier, he said to me, from now on, whatever happen to you, don\u2122t go to the lower echelon; higher you go, action you get. You know what I\u2122m saying? 49 Interviewer: Yeah, of course. Irving Hass: He says don\u2122t \u2013 always go to the top. And h e \u2013 he shook my hand s, and he says : I\u2122ll take care of it. He says: Thank God. Then looks at my file; he says : Soldier, you got an excellent record , to me. Basic training s in the sch ooling, you know, and everything, he says, excellent. I came back in the office. Morris is sitting there , and the other guy says : Don\u2122 t you ever pick up the phone when it\u2122s ringing now. You\u2122re gonna hear a ring pretty soon. The phone rings; Sergeant Willingham answers it: Yes sir , yes sir, yes sir. He \u2013 the Korean War was on. He put him on a levy. Know what the colonel did? Sergeant, you \u2122re gonna be transferred on a \u2013 on a ship, and you\u2122re going to Korea. Willingham comes out , and he\u2122s in a transfer ; sees me. And he know \u0160 the co lonel told him. See this little guy ? he said . This little guy had the guts to come to see me, the colonel told to the sergeant. He went through hell in Europe; lost his father and mother and sisters. And he had the guts to come and see me; and what you guys did. And I \u2013 he did not \u0160 did he obey you? He says: Sure . The sergeant says : He obeyed your orders \u2013 my order s. So we obeyed. I says : One thing, we gonna wash the windows, he told us \u0160 we gonna wash the windows. And t hat colonel gave me power in my mind. And I was telling this to my daughter too. When she was going to college, she has a problem in college \u0160 you go to the dean. You don\u2122t talk to the little peon. If you have a problem, you go to the top; and he took c are of it. And t hese two guys couldn\u2122t get over , he said : Well I did . I says : Don\u2122t answer the phone, let him answer the phone. And he got out of the \u2013 the \u2013 the thing. And that colonel, he says: You know what I am? He says : I\u2122m a Catholic \u0160 the colonel. And \u2013 and I know this should not happen in this mine \u2013 my man\u2122s army, he said to me. And I say s: Colonel, I never refuse anything. When I was alive [?], the \u2013 the ser geant picks out people from my whole kommando \u0160 you go on a KP. He comes to me: Hey you\u2122re going on KP. And all of a sudden, all the guys want ed to stand the back of the row; you know, the guards can\u2122t see \u0160 maybe he doesn\u2122t pick \u201aem. I did KP once, and I worked for about 14 hours; t hat was my last KP. The sergean t never picked me again. I ask him: Sergeant why don\u2122t you pick me? He says : You know why ? You were never squawk ed \u0160 to me. I pick a guy, he says , with bi \u2013 bi \u2013 bitching \u2013 h e says: I did it, you know, and so on. I never squawk ed; I list ened to him, and I meant it . He never picked me on KP aga in. I could stand in front line \u0160 and everything. And I \u2013 and I sai d the same thing to \u2013 to obey. And t hat\u2122s one, my philosophy. And th en whe n I start coming a life to go to work, and I sat in the civilian life when I was workin g here . I came out of the army. I\u2122m not gonna go back to the 50 textile because I saw I have no future. I went to school to learn to read drawings, you know, blueprints. Th ere was an answer in the \u2013 in an ad from a company in Bu nsen [sp, ph?] Road in New York. That was the company; they were making a system for the Boeing [?] Company. They were architects and making dams and making shelters for weapons. The guy interviews me and says okay \u0160 I get the job. I go into work, and I get the \u2013 work with a guy \u0160 Supervisor \u2013 Zosen [sp, ph?] was his name. He like s me, and all of a sudden gives me responsibility. We bec ome a subcontractor to AMF whi ch used to be American Machine and Foundry Company, and they were in Brooklyn and Connecticut. And t hey assigned me to work with AMF project, and I speak to the AMF guys and so on. And t he AMF guy says how would you like to work for the AMF? I says I don\u2122t mind, if \u2013 if so long it\u2122s in Brooklyn. They send me from Bunsen Road to a Canadian company and a job \u0160 to get some informat ion for the Boeing Company. I\u2122m in Canada , and I call up home \u0160 my wife ; and my wife says to me: You g ot a telegram. I says : From where is it? From AMF ; they offered yo u a job. I says : How much? She tells me. I says: You write up a telegram, and say we will accept. I come \u2013 I \u2013 I call in Canada, call my boss from Canada and give him notice. I called the guy in Canada \u2013 from Canada to Bunsen and says : I\u2122m leaving in two w eeks; I got another job. He sa ys: Where ? I sa ys: W ith AMF. I\u2122m gonna work on the same project with you guys \u0160 and I\u2122m gonna be [? ] from the other side now. So I stay in Brooklyn and work about four weeks; t hey transfer the project to \u2013 to Greenwich, Con nec ticut. Here I come here, and I have a car, and it\u2122s very far from Brooklyn to go to Greenwich, Connecticut. I go into personnel, and I says : Listen , I can\u2122t do it. They says we g et you a car pool. Personnel goes through, and now I got Sheepshead Bay, a guy; I got one in Canarsie , I got that. We got a car pool; I didn\u2122t quit my job. Work in Connecticut, and then AMF got a big contract with the Air Force, and I mak e really good points. I like the job, and they like me \u0160 w as reading drawings, picking up specia l things from the drawings \u0160 too ls, and so on \u0160 which I had a ball. And I like d the company \u201atil somebody, a relative, comes from Cleveland and offer s me a job in a furniture \u0160 to be a salesman for him. And h e offer s me nice things and so on. And I live i n a little apartment in Brooklyn , and I said , okay, I\u2122m gonna accept the job in Cleveland. I co me back and get to the girl ; I\u2122m going to dictate you a memo. And I \u2013 I remember it from memory, the memo like this in my memory. And I says: I hereby tender my resignation from such a progressive company; not for the reason I do not like my job. I got a \u2013 a special offer in a different field , and I thank the \u2013 the company for the opportunity they gave me and so on. And I copy to personnel and a copy to the vice-president. And t he v ice-president the next day calls me up. He says : You know, your memo \u0160 the \u2013 the 51 resignation; I never saw it with resignation like this. You know, I gave \u2013 I gave the truth. I liked the company ; I told the truth. He says: You know, you\u2122 re not gonna quit. The vice -president tells me, says: You know, I\u2122m not gonna let you go. I\u2122m gonna mak e you a supervisor \u0160 s tay. I come home and tell my wife . I says : Ann, he made me a supervisor, and h e gave me a raise ; and I stay. And I was going to AMF and working; I became really noticeable. And I don\u2122t have a college ed ucation, everything on my own; and h ere was tec hnical. Okay, the supervisor had for ty people working already. All of a sudden, I \u2013 I\u2122m buying a house in Fairfield, Conn ecticut \u0160 by the college. AMF got more and more jobs. And all of a sudden they got a job on the Titan Weapon System , and they pick me t o go to Santa Barbara \u0160 relocating . I gave a deposit, they building this house. I run right back, I says, stop. He says I could give you t he deposit back \u0160 yes; t he company said if \u2013 you lose the deposit, we\u2122ll \u2013 we \u2122ll pay for it. They transfer me to Santa Barbara, and we did not want to move. So I\u2122m commuting from Brooklyn to Stamford, Conn ecticut ; from Gren \u2013 from Greenwich they moved me to Stam ford \u0160 it\u2122s another eight miles. Work and so on; and everything, you know, and AMF was involved \u0160 my God \u0160 bowling, you name it. You know, here were \u2013 here were all kind of \u2013 you know \u0160 very big comp any. I got transferred from Brooklyn \u2013 from Stamfor d to York. And h ere is the transfer. One day the government has a plant, a N avy facility in York, Pennsylvania. You probably passed it on [ Note Route] 30, okay; it was not 30 then . And I got a package home \u0160 so thick. The vicepresident says a letter , this is confidential; c ertain people were selected. You were selected to go to York, Pennsylvania to prepare a bid. You\u2122re gonna check into this ho \u2013 hotel, and you\u2122re gonna meet some other people. You are sell [?] \u2013 you section is to estimate logistics. You k now what a word \u0160 logistics ? Interviewer: Sure. Irving Hass: Okay, y ou said estimate logistics; and do not tell a soul. \ufb01 Ooh\ufb02 \u2013 and St amford they say AMF is moving \u2013 nobody \u2013 ; leaks got out. The \u2013 the company says we\u2122re not moving. I co me, and I did look o n the map; I never been in York. I chec k into the hotel, and I go through that facility ; I never believe it. Oh my God \u0160 big; firing range, 360 acres! The plant is now Harley -Davidson. I make up the package; AMF is the lowest bidder \u2013 I mean the highest bi dder. Chrysler, General Motors, all of them bid for that. We were the highest bidder with 1.4 million. The contract was to get the plant plus 55 million continuation contract. We had to take over about 350 personnel, transfer red with the seniority and so on. My job is to read up because they had a logistic s department there. We were preparing logistic documentation, you know, for service of our lo gistics \u2013 52 prepare ser \u2013 service equipment. And I co me back; the company announc e we\u2122re moving. So they asking me what people would you like from your department to move. The company \u2013 t he vice -president asked me; I says I pick ed cer \u2013 certain people. In a matter of a month, two months, I was already transferred. For about eight weeks, I was commuting from York, Penn sylvania, that\u2122s why I re member that highway to New York \u0160 the Turnpike and so on. The company paid all the car expenses \u0160 gas, mileage. Stay in York, Pennsylvania \u0160 we build a house. A house for $21,000, which sells for $1 50,000 now; sold that time in \u201a64. We \u2013 t hey \u2013 they moved three divisions, AMF did; Thomas Division, the Engineering D ivision , and the B uffalo Division. We moved on \u2013 we moved on 550 families. You don\u2122t know what this town became. So much business came in from this move. And I was there \u0160 \u201a til all of a sudden they transfer red me to a different project. One t he government phased out \u2013 how you gonna be in [?] the LPG projec t; which is liquid petroleum tanks for rural area homes. You know, they\u2122re making this \u2013 the gas \u2013 enough for gas. And then from York, they transfer red me to Des Moines, Io wa. That\u2122s what I say s I wind up in Des Moines. Then I was \u2013 in Des Moine s I was made assistant to the president, and the guy put me in to write procedures of everything under the sun, you know. And t hat guy was a \u2013 he \u2013 he developed the Head Ski; and he became from Head Ski . AMF bought Head Ski, and he became vice -president. And then he became \u2013 and he says : Irving I went through your folder, I want you to work for me. And y ou talk about people. He says: I like you. You call a spade a spade; and that\u2122s what I\u2122m doing. And m y office was outside the executive office , but you could bust a wall and \u2013 and close up the door, you wind up in the executive office. Bill Songs [sp, ph?], was his name, call s me in an d says , Irving, we\u2122re gonna bust a wall , and we\u2122re gonna share the secretary. He issues a memo to the vice -president of operation; t wo weeks go by \u0160 nobody\u2122s carpenters, no come, no no thing. He call s me in, and he says : Irving , [Note there is a loud slap] that door is gonna be busted tonight, and I guarantee you. The guys didn\u2122t want \u2013 want me because, you know, there\u2122s jealousy in the company goes around. He move me there next to him , and he assign me to the lawn and garden division which Sears makes mow ers. We mak e them for a private label. You know the \u2013 the smallest would cut gra ss \u0160 you could see in my garage, I got all this private label. And I go through the logistics in Sears. And Sears \u2013 they buy a mower \u0160 something is breaking; they send to the f actory to get a washer. The washer cost s 50 cents, and Sears sp \u2013 spends $3 \u2013 to \u2013 the paperwork and $4 to ship; they losing money. And I go into this job, and I say : Oh my gosh ; look it \u0160 how many 53 orders are you getting from Sears? The guy says to me : Oh my God, we got 3,000 this month. And how much is the total? The 3,000 total about $12,000. I says: You crazy. I go out to Chicago, and I speak to the buyer, and I says : Listen, I\u2122m gonna make an analysis and see what\u2122s going on. In the meantime, I had a go od fellow working for me, and I says : Eph [sp, ph?] Jones \u2013 Eph \u2013 you\u2122re gonna come with me to Chicago, and we\u2122re gonna take all the data down. I told Sears that you guys are losing money; they \u2013 they pull their hair out. I prove it to them on charts. So h ere we ge t away with shipping no more from the factory. Sears had to ship it to a Philadelphia warehouse, and the warehouse is dealing with the \u2013 with the store. We were dealing with stores , you know, with \u2013 with the customer ; and I made a change on that. Another change come in. The \u2013 the boss got promoted; He takes over a \u2013 a bicycle division in Little Rock, Arkansas and a division in California. And comes in; he says : Irving , you\u2122re going to Arkansas. To Arkansas? Not me! And I tell you , that\u2122s where I wind up with my life in there . In all the time in my life, when my daughter used to see this, and I used to tell her: Go to the top, learn \u0160 important things. And t hat\u2122s why I always with the supervisors \u0160 never. And I \u2013 I \u2013. People kno w where you stay . We had in New York, a lieutenant general was \u2013 which is \u2013 was the Chairman of the Board\u2122s buddy; he gave him a job. He wants to fish out who is a supervisor, who \u2122s not a supervisor. Fishing out, you know \u0160 want s to know if he have the brains to be a supervisor. In one brain, he did, he came in nine o\u2122clock with a package. He says to me: Your work are needed immediately. Nine -thirty he came s with another package. I need this in 30 minutes. Ten -thirty he came s in with another package; and here I got two packages I couldn\u2122t say. I look at one package, he says with credit \u0160 no. I look for another package \u0160 is it a question some manual data \u0160 no. The third package has to do, if I furnish this information , we will furnish you an order, you know, of so and so. I took the order package first \u0160 he gave me the last \u0160 to do the job. I finished it, he calls me in. He says : You see m, Hass , to me the general [?] . I gave this package, was to nine people. Everybody still working on package one. You got package three, which one I needed. Why \u2013 why did I get package three? I says : It\u2122s more important because there \u2013 there\u2122s gonna be an order from it. Package \u2013 the f irst is on credit, you know the guy\u2122s waited so long for credit; he wait another ten days, i t\u2122s not gonna hurt. And t hat\u2122 s why the guy wanted to fish out; if you have authority. Then I used to go to seminars. At seminars, the guy was teaching the same thing. A -BC he says , assert yourself management seminars . He says assert yourself everything, A-BC. Interviewer: S o this is the kind of thinking \u2013 54 [Interviewer and Irving Hass talking over each other] Irving Hass: This is the kind of thinking, and that\u2122 s why I sur \u2013 Interviewer: \u2013 that helped you survive? Irving Hass: \u2013 survived in Auschwitz \u0160 because of this. Right away, I don\u2122t know what got in to me or something from my father. I could not stand. I was right away in that \u2013; I \u2013 I thought to myself it\u2122s gonna be better, whatever happens. Interviewer: What was on your father\u2122s mind, as far as you can tell? Irving Hass: My father\u2122s mind, he knew righ t away he\u2122s gonna \u2013 he \u2013 this is gonna be of \u2013 of \u2013 of last. He said it in the railroad car. Interviewer: When you got in the car? Irving Hass: In the car, he says to his friend there, talking. He says : Binyamin [sp, ph?] \u2013 Interviewer: He fears the worst. Irving Hass: Binyamin, he said, what\u2122s gonna happen? He called him and said : You know what\u2122s gonna happen. I don\u2122t trust the Germans. And h e knows that from the First War were the same thing \u0160 they took us to Russia; and all of a sudden \u0160 tell you \u0160 some of them survived, some of them \u0160 they were killed in the First War. And who my fath \u2013 father to wind up in Tashkent from \u2013 from Ruscova \u0160 sent Tashkent; which is 4,000 miles or something. And \u2013 and he knew right away. Intervi ewer: So he thought you would all be killed? Irving Hass: He thought \u2013 Interviewer: \u2013 everybody would be killed. [Interviewer is talking over Irving.] Irving Hass: He thought we \u2122re all gonna be killed , and he says to me bef \u2013\u0160 in the railroad car \u0160 one word I could never forget. Whatever happen to me, he says , don\u2122t lose your religion \u0160 to me \u0160 whatever happen in the \u2013 in the camp. I said to myself: There\u2122 s no God. I\u2122m not gonna believe in God. Interviewer: This is when you were in the cattle car? Irving Hass: In the \u2013 in the cattle \u2013. In the \u2013 yeah. 55 [Interviewer and Irving talking over each other.] Interviewer: When you questioned God\u2122s existence? Irving Hass: Yeah, in the \u2013 in the concentration camp; not in the cattle car. Interviewer: T he cattle car yo u \u2013 Irving Hass: Was still \u2013 Interviewer: Y ou still believed in Go d? Irving Hass: Was still believed in God. But when I was in the camp, I said there\u2122s no God. I \u2013 I don\u2122t believe it. God cannot see people suffering no matter who you are , what religion; I s ays no. And then I saw, when after I got separated, I came to New York. I says listen , maybe God g ave this [?] because he punished us. And I\u2122m back , and that\u2122s what I tried to teach my children. Interviewer: So you did listen to your father in the end? Irving Hass: So I did listen; that\u2122s what I\u2122m saying. Did listen to my father , and my father said: No matter what you do, this is gonna bring you back to life. And I know I \u2013 I had bad days, and \u2013 and so metime I could\u2122ve got killed \u0160 with a car. We \u2013 we wer e almost, you know, terrible \u0160 and I saw my father in front of me. Interviewer: So your father thought the Germans would kill everybody? Irving Hass He \u2013 he \u2013 I would say he knew this. He knew this in his heart. Because the First World War told him what \u2013 what happens \u0160 i t\u2122s a war . B ecause he knew America was involved ; and it \u2122s not gonna be easy to hold America, France , and England and so on. Interviewer: What about your mother? What did \u2013 [unintelligible] ? Irving Hass: My mother was not \u2013 not more like thi s. Like I said, my mother was a gentle lady, knows how to take care of the family , you know, and everything; but never knew politics or \u2013 or business type . Interviewer: But on this deportation in the train \u2013 to Auschwitz, what \u2013 [Interviewer and Irving ta lking over each other.] Irving Hass: In the deportation she was only crying. My mother was crying and everything . I says : I wish we were going to see it and everything, you know. And hugged me in the railroad car; oh my God, she must have hugged me hundred s of times. 56 Interviewer: She must have hugged all the kids. Irving Hass: Really I can\u2122t ever forget. That \u2122s why I \u2013 I \u2013 when I see a movie , and I \u2013 told my wife, it\u2122s about a concentration camp \u0160 don\u2122t watch it. I says : No, I\u2122m gonna watch it, because that is in my heart. I got to \u0160 nobody should forget. And t he Holocaust Memorial is the greatest thing we ever did. Interviewer: Could you get \u2013 ? You never had a chance to say goodbye to your sisters? Irving Hass: No. I just pulled away the guy, and that\u2122s it. And I don\u2122t \u2013 I\u2122m saying from \u2013 my family, one would survive \u0160 nobody \u2013 from my family . \u2013 [unintelligible]. And when I met my wife, she\u2122s a \u2013 was an orphan; her mother died. And s he was in high school. And i t\u2122s a \u2013 also a miracle I went up \u2013 to camp. In the camp, I \u2013 I got to there, two weeks they got free vacation for me \u0160 from the organization. Lehman \u2013 the Governor Leh man donated a camp for orphans and so on, children \u0160 nonsectari an, Jewish and non-Jewish. OK there\u2122 s r eally \u2013 I met some nice people ou t th ere. And I \u2013 I \u2013 I checked in , and I saw this girl. The minute I saw her \u2013. I didn\u2122t have a steady \u2013 I mean a good-paying job \u0160 didn\u2122t have a thing. And I said to uncle and aunt, I says : I can\u2122t marry, what am I going to do? He says : Don\u2122t worry, marriage brings luck, whatever. And \u2013 s o I dropped her. Three weeks later, she called up and ask ed what happened. He didn\u2122t \u2013 I didn\u2122t call her. I says : You know, I \u2013 I cannot. And t hen I called her from then on. I just \u2013 I had a ri ng which I brought from Germa ny \u0160 a little ring \u0160 and I \u2013 gave it to her; I says : We\u2122re engaged. And t hen my uncle and aunt, with the family , planned a wedding. And \u2013 I got married in \u2013 in Henington Hall in the East Side. And \u2013 and \u2013 and t hat\u2122s why \u2013 that\u2122s why now wh ich I read in the paper an d I see in television, people don\u2122t say there is no \u2013 Holocaust. How can a person say which people come in today\u2122s world; which I would only able to talk to him and show hi m a pic ture that I went through this? And I have seen this , and you tell me there is so in California pictures, there never was a Holocaust. Where is my town of 300 people? Maybe the entire town, maybe 12 or 14 survived. I don\u2122t think we have twelve \u2013 from the entire town of 300 families. And this is an outrageous. And this Holocaust Memorial should be really built that should be stand for hundreds of years. I know the \u2013 the data what they \u2013 what you accumulate should be there for hundreds of years. Generations should come; generation, generation to follow. Interviewer: Let\u2122s hop e so. Irving Hass: So I really \u2013 I really; it\u2122s real ly bad. 57 Interviewer: Do you have anything else to say? Irving Hass: The only thing I can say, I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity. Interviewer : Thank you, I appreciate it , and I thank you. Irving Hass: And I \u2013 I really thank the organization. Whatever happens, I\u2122m really happy. Interviewer: I thank you on behalf of the Holocaust Museum. Irving Hass: Thank you.",
