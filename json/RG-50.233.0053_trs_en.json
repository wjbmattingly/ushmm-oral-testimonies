His\nfather, who had served in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War 1, was a supervisor for\na lumber manufacturing company; he was away all week, coming home on Fridays. His mother\nraised the children and tended the family\u2019s garden. Irving attended a Romanian public school and\na cheder before the Hungarians came. Early in the war, his uncle in America sent food packages\nto the family. When the Hungarians took over, there was food rationing; there was no public\nschool for the Jews; many men were taken for labor; they had to wear a yellow star. The\nGermans came in with the Hungarians.\nSoon his family, along with the other Jewish families in Ruscova were marched to a ghetto in\nViseu [Note First transcription has this as Wishov. Second transcription notes this as Vitsyuv.\nHowever, Vitsyuv is in the Ukraine and is further from Ruscova than the distance Irving Hass\nindicates. There are many sources that mention Viseu de Sus as having a ghetto.] From there\nthey were loaded into cattle cars and taken to Auschwitz. His five sisters and parents were taken\nto the crematorium, and he was sent to the barracks. One day he jumped out of the barracks and\ngot into a line of people being transferred to Theresienstadt, where he was put to work building a\nhighway. He survived by placing paper under his striped uniform for warmth and stealing raw\npotatoes at night to ease his hunger. From Theresienstadt he was sent to another camp and then\nto Flossenbiirg. As the liberating forces approached, there was a forced march to a forest where\nthe Germans machine-gunned those still alive; Irving was shot and taken to a hospital by an\nAmerican.\nAfter the war he started looking for his family. Emily Post helped him get on the ship The Ernie\nPyle and he arrived in New York on June 20, 1947. After a short stay with HIAS, he was placed\nin the custody of his uncle. In New York, he was given treatment for a nervous stomach\ncondition. He was drafted into the US Army and succeeded in fighting the anti-Semitism of his\nSergeant by \u201cgoing to the top\u201d and informing the Colonel. Mr. Hass studied how to read\nblueprints and tells of his many promotions and transfers during his working years. Mr. Hass\nbelieves that remembering his father\u2019s teachings helped him through the Holocaust and in life.\nTranscript\nTape One, Side A\nHASS, IRVING Intrvw\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nInterviewer: My name is Anthony Dilorio and I\u2019m at the home of Mr. Irving Hass in\nWyomissing, Pennsylvania, and I\u2019m here on behalf of the Holocaust Museum in\nWashington to interview Mr. Hass about his experiences during the Holocaust.\nGood afternoon, Irving.\nIrving Hass: How are you doing? Nice meeting you.\nInterviewer: A pleasure meeting you and your wife.\nIrving Hass: Thank you.\nInterviewer: Perhaps we can begin by telling us when you were born and where you were born.\nIrving Hass: I was born on May 18, 1925 in a town named Ruscova [Riskeva, Riskeve,\nRiskova, Riskovi, Ruskava, Ruskova, Visha Orom, Visooroszi], Romania. My\nfather was working for a lumber manufacturing in a ... fifteen miles from\nRuscova; and we were a nice family together. He used to work all week and used\nto come home on ... only on Fridays, Saturdays from his work. I went to Hebrew\nschool, which was called cheder, and I went to the regular school. And was a\nquiet town, and we were really happy, like you say, as a family. My father always\nsays ... said to me \u2014 education and to be believing what you heard and done; that\nwill carry you far, and I always believed in my father and mother. And at one day,\nin the early time, we were here in the war zone with Germany. And it was still\nHungarian at one time \u2014 occupied, Hungarian-occupied, our town. And later on\nthen the Romanians came back, and it was going back and forth; I cannot\nremember exactly. The town \u2014 we had two synagogues and about two or ... I\nwould say, 350 Jewish families. And we had our own house, and we lived close to\nthe police department. And then we used to see how time changes, because of this\nwar going on with the Nazis. My father read good German, and he was telling us\nwhat the Germans were doing. And we heard the word, \u201cEisenhower\u201d; and I\nheard about ... talking about Eisenhower and the command and so on. And then\nhe got a hold of ... he brought a German newspaper, which he\u2019s got where he was\nworking. And ... and then was reading; and I could read already real good\nGerman. And it was telling what the war ... Hitler ... was going on. And one day,\nthey came in and took some ... certain people from our town in advance; and like\n... they send them to a labor camp, which is ... young boys actually ... which in\nthe early, let\u2019s say in the twenties and twenty-five. And we never heard from\nthem, you know. Then the Hungarians came in; which we were under Hungary\nwhen the Nazis took us. And they took us to a ... a place where we ... we\nassembled \u2014 in synagogue, church; wherever was room. And then they start\nmarching us out \u2014 which 1s a town \u2014 it\u2019s about 40 miles from Ruscova, called\n2\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nVitsyuv [Vitsev, Wiciow]. [Note First transcription has this as Wishov. Second\ntranscription notes this as Vitsyuv. However, Vitsyuv is in the Ukraine and is\nfurther from Ruscova than the distance Irving Hass indicates. There are many\nsources that mention Viseu de Sus as having a ghetto.] I don\u2019t know how to spell\nit now \u2014 but Vit ... Vitsyuv and there we\u2019re transported, loaded ... loaded in\ntrains, cattle car. My father was a traveled man, and he know that this is\nsomething not to believe; and he was saying: Oh God, help me. So they loaded us\nin the car with all German soldiers with mixed-in Hungarians which ... from the\nHungarian army. And whatever we could take \u2014 we left the tables and kitchens,\neverything ... you know ... with the ... the food on the table; and we just took\nwhatever we could grab. In Vitsyuv, the transport which they loaded us in cattle\ncars, and then they sealed it, and we traveling. And going around, my father\nrecognized, he says: Oh my God, we are no more in ... in Hungary, we are in\nPoland. And he says: God \u2014 where could they take us to Poland? We didn\u2019t\nknow about Auschwitz; we didn\u2019t know about anything, and here we are ... going\nat night. They didn\u2019t give us anything to eat, and people were drinking their urine\nin the rail ... in the car, crying; and we had some ... some of them were already\nsuffocated to death in that railroad car. It took us about three and a half days to\nreach the destination.\nInterviewer: What time of the day did you get into the ...?\nIrving Hass: We got into ...

That was Poland, and we arrived in\nAuschwitz. And as we were going, I don\u2019t know what side I was going. It was the\nleft or the right; and he was segregating. And that\u2019s the last time I saw my father\nand mother and my four sisters. I don\u2019t \u2014 say five sisters. It was four ... five\nsisters; my father and mother and five sisters; and my mother was crying. They\ntook me away, and I wound up in the barracks; wooden barracks in Auschwitz. I\nthought I saw chimneys there and smoke and people going around. And the\nsleeping on a wooden shelf; it\u2019s like a shelf \u2014 staggered. And one day in\nAuschwitz, people were assembling to go. And I didn\u2019t care where they going; I\njumped out of the barracks, and I got in the line. And the line was lucky; we were\ntransferred to ... Theresienstadt. And ... and ... Theresienstadt, I don\u2019t know\nwhat that camp, that Theresienstadt, and we were .... Find out we were, I...

In ... in Auschwitz, could have been maybe to go to the crematorium, I\ndidn\u2019t know. I was lucky that transport was going to Theresienstadt to work. And\nI wind up there, I was no more in Auschwitz; I was in Theresienstadt. And from\nthere I was working.\nInterviewer: How long were you in Auschwitz then?\nIrving Hass: I would say I was in Auschwitz not more than four days.

I would probably have been ... been burned in Auschwitz\njust like my father and mother and five sisters. I was working in Theresienstadt\nthere, and they were ... they were taking us out to work. And we were working ...\nworking on a highway, to make a highway. I remember we had \u2014 the stones had\nto be standing up and flat. And each one, individual, put in by hand. And they had\nmachinery they put me in; they were grinding stones. Today\u2019s date, I have to yell\nsometimes; I think I\u2019m there. People tell me, don\u2019t yell when you talk to me.\nNow, and it ... my wife couple of times said, and some people also when I talk\nand I forget myself \u2014 because I was working with a guy next to the stone\nmachine, we couldn\u2019t hear each other. I was screaming to ... to say a word he\nshould understand what ... what it mean ... what I\u2019m talking. And from then on\nPm thinking. I\u2019m looking \u2014 still on this machine; and that I\u2019m talking. So we\nwere ...

And we were getting one meal a day which is ... a... la[?] ... water and\nwhatever. And I still did not care what I do; so I was sleeping in the barracks, and\nI was going at night to go into places where I stole potatoes. I was small, and I\ncrawled underneath; and the guys used to tell me: You \u2019re gonna be shot. I says:\nWhat can I worry about to be shot? I came back with ... with potatoes \u2014 raw\npotatoes, and we were eating. I came back with ... with whatever. Think I went\nthere in ... in the ... in the place at night, and I took chances.

You know \u2014 you\u2019re walking in public?\nIrving Hass: Walking in public; I could walk maybe a mile. We were close to the synagogue.\nAnd we were completely restricted like to go; we couldn\u2019t go no place. I couldn\u2019t\ntravel to a different town.\nInterviewer: So what did ... what did your family do during these years of Hungarian\noccupation?\nIrving Hass: They ... they were just trying to live it through. Whatever ... whatever mo ...\nmother grew in the garden, we were eating. And whatever corn we would have;\nwe would have every morning \u2014 cornmeal. To make it with boiling water,\ncornmeal, we had a mill which grinded corn. From corn to make flour. So in the\nmorning that\u2019s all I remember since I was \u2014 I would say, since I... I .... The...\nthe Romanians were not .... That\u2019s all we had was cornmeal for breakfast.\nInterviewer: Cornmeal.\nIrving Hass: Cornmeal \u2014 you make it with water, and it boils; you mix it in. Mamaliga they\ncall it, okay. In Romania, they call 1t Mamaliga; so we had every morning\nMamaliga and milk. And the only way we could get milk is to know some of\nthese people in town. Some of these Ukrainian people. I don\u2019t know what you call\nit, Ukrainian there I remember the word what you called that people. And the milk\nwe used to get from cows, and we milk it right.

Especially you gota...\nyou got a mark on yourself \u2014 you\u2019re Jewish. That\u2019s the minute he said, right\naway, you\u2019re Jewish, you ... you identified yourself. So you can\u2019t go. If you want\nto go to Budapest, want to go to Bucharest, you couldn\u2019t. At that time, I don\u2019t\nknow how strictly the borders were, and I would say the borders were strict. But\nthere were still packages coming in. Only Czechoslovakia was free.\nInterviewer: Until the Nazis came?\nIrving Hass: \u2018Til the Nazis. But I\u2019m talking free from America to get mail. I know my uncle\nwas shipping packages.\nInterviewer: Your uncle in America?\nIrving Hass: In America \u2014 shipping packages to us.

Shipped it to an address in TrbouSany [Note This Czechoslovakian town is\nway more than 40 miles from Ruscova. Ruscova is at a far distance from\nCzechoslovakia; Ruscova is closer to Ukraine where there is a town called\nTrebuSany. It is more likely to be able to be smuggled into Ukraine in a night than\ninto Czechoslovakia.] I remember the ... the town. TrbouSany was\nCzechoslovakia, and that\u2019s why we had to go and pick up the package. And pick\nup the package at a ... at night \u2014 get yourself smuggled into Czechoslovakia;\nacross the border and bring in the package.

And they were trying to\nidentify us. If you wanted to go out of the house, you couldn\u2019t have out of the\nhouse without a yellow badge and star. Another thing, the Jewish girls were\nmaking this, and they looked nice decorated on their clothes. You know,\neverything we would look and something, you know, and all of a sudden a nice\nyellow star is ... 1s on the dress, or on the jacket \u2014 sewed on; and is decorated.\n28\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nAnd this is just to understand it between the townspeople.

[Note previous transcription has \u00b042, but it is difficult to\nreally discern what is on the tape. According to many documents, Germans came\nto this area of Romania in 1944. |\nIrving Hass: They only took away ... only took away certain homes where ... where they\nwanted to have their headquarters.\nInterviewer: So there was no ghetto in Ruscova?\nIrving Hass: In... in... in Ruscova, right away they took us to Viseu (Viseu de Sus, Viseul,\nFelshevisho, Ober Visho, Ober Wisho, Oyber Visheve, Vishya, Viso). [Note First\ntranscription has this as Wishov. Second transcription notes this as Vitsyuv.\nHowever, Vitsyuv is in the Ukraine and 1s further from Ruscova than the distance\nIrving Hass indicates. There are many sources that mention Viseu de Sus as\nhaving a ghetto.] And... and... and ... and there\u2019s \u2014 the ghetto was in Viseu.\nBut I was lucky; we were at least eight, ten days there; and they took our\ntransport.

[Note probably Viseu]\nIrving Hass: In Vitsyuv [Note probably Viseu], I would say maybe two or two and a half. And\nI did not come all of us on the same transport. That\u2019s why they segregated us, and\nsome what happened, maybe in different barracks or something.

In Auschwitz, there was the unpacking. Because\nwhen I said when I saw the things, you know, from the Nuremberg Trial \u2014 that\nbooklet, and that showed how ... how they unloaded people; and they had\neverything to get undressed.

And I was right next to him; staying to .... He ... he was lucky;\nwhen he got in, he got to a window. And by the window he was seeing what\u2019s\ngoing on, and he was telling us.

My father could ...\ncould see in the windows, and the other people could see in the windows. And\nthen we were so glad when we opened up the car in Auschwitz \u2014 oh my God.\nAnd they told us that time: Oh you \u2019re going to go ... \u2014 Arbeit Macht Frei, they\nhave all these signs in Auschwitz.\nInterviewer: What\u2019s the first thing you saw when they opened the car?\n35\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nIrving Hass: Germans \u2014 lined up.

That\u2019s\nwhy not one survived. You see, if they would\u2019ve separated from their mother to\nbe individual, you know, they would probably have the whip to go to the left too,\nbecause the ... the kid looked real good, you know, not undernourished \u2014 my\nsisters, you know. And they would go; but the other girls ... My sister\u2019s friend\nwhich gave me the other picture, she said: J separate from my mother. They put\nme away when they unloaded me in the car.

The little girl walking?\nIrving Hass: Everyone. They not allowed to carry anything. The little one even walked. And\nthe last time I saw my family, un ... we unloaded. And I can\u2019t forget it \u2018til this\ndate. The unloading of Auschwitz \u2014 that\u2019s the last day I saw my family.\nInterviewer: Your father \u2014 was he still with your mother?\nIrving Hass: My father with my mother, together with the five sisters.\nInterviewer: So they were all sent together?\nIrving Hass: All sent together. And I know for a fact, they were burned the same week or the\nsame day when they arrived. Because my sister would\u2019ve been survived if they\nwould be separated. My sister was an aggressive girl \u2014 the big one, Sheindel [sp,\nph?].\nInterviewer: Sheindel.\nIrving Hass: Yeah. She was an aggressive girl like that; I couldn\u2019t believe it.

And I start, still\ncorresponding and finding from HIAS, Red Cross; and all of them, even after I\nwas in the United States \u2014 couldn\u2019t find any.\n36\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nInterviewer: So Sheindel is the most aggressive \u2014 the strongest girl in your family?\nIrving Hass: The strongest girl from all of them, she was a really aggressive. Loved the mother\n\u2014 I\u2019m telling you \u2014 always, just like, you know, for mom and everything, you\nknow. And she didn\u2019t want to separate. And the kid did not know where they\ngoing; they want to be together as a family.\nInterviewer: How would you describe the other girls?\nIrving Hass: The other girls were the same, but they\u2019re not so more attached, because, you\nknow, she is the ... she was the leader. The other was ... the other one was a\nfollower.\nInterviewer: So the other girls were following Sheindel?\nIrving Hass: Following what Sheindel \u2014 what she was doing.

In ... in home, they\nwere always listening to \u2014 the ... the sisters were listening to her.\nInterviewer: And as you got off the train, and you were walking and then getting separated, did\nanybody have any idea what was gonna happen? What did you think was gonna\nhappen?\nIrving Hass: I didn\u2019t even know it was an oven. I didn\u2019t even know what Auschwitz was.

Two days went by, and nothing happened. When I saw these people lined\nup outside, they were ready to go and to tattoo you. When I saw these people\nlined up, I get out of the barrack, and somebody didn\u2019t see me. I crawled out and\nformed in a line.

But what it\ngot me \u2014 all the ... the thing after the war I heard ... no American bombers \u2014\nthey knowed the intelligence \u2014 couldn\u2019t bomb Auschwitz. They would have\nsaved millions; 1t would have ... so maybe a million Jews would have been killed,\nwhoever was in Auschwitz. And they could have bombed it and destroyed the\nrailroads. And the railroad tracks were never destroyed.\nInterviewer: Was Flossenburg ever bombed?\nIrving Hass: Flossenburg was bombed during the minutes what you call the ... during the end\nof the war when we already in the forest \u2014 they bombed it.

They bombed it before the tracks.\nInterviewer: Because of the military action going by, nearby ...\nIrving Hass: The military; you see, the military was already going. And the Germans were\nalready given up. Like I said \u2014 they shot us there and started escaping. I know\nthe Third Army was the one who liberated ... liberated me.

And they had different\ntype of labor set-up. Some of \u2018em were working in factories, and some of \u2018em\nwere working on the roads and special projects.\nInterviewer: When you saw these executions, and you saw those people dying, did you think\nthey were lucky, or they were unlucky?\nIrving Hass: Sometimes I think that they were lucky. When I was ... I feeling downgraded,\nlike I was so cold and hungry, I said: J wish I would be on the hanging list. And\nthen in my mind came that, Oh no, it\u2019s not gonna go on forever; you gonna\nsurvive. And that\u2019s one thing ... two ... two things came to my mind \u2014 |... I\nwished I would be there, and then I thought to myself: Oh no, I\u2019m gonna survive.\nAnd I did survive. The mostly lucky day when I survived is that shooting in that\nforest. And to that day\u2019s day, I cannot forget.\nInterviewer: Saved by a tree?\nIrving Hass: Saved by atree, and then to have typhus \u2014 people die of typhus \u2014 and survived.\nAnd when I was telling this to people, they couldn\u2019t believe that I had typhus in\n1945 and survived because Schwandorf there was a close hospital there. And a\nlucky soldier caught me, and get me to the hospital. I don\u2019t even know today\u2019s\ndate who it was.\nInterviewer: Looking back \u2014 all this \u2014 what was your worst moment?\nIrving Hass: The worst moment is always thinking to myself, and thinking, it says: Why did\nthis happen? There is no God. I said: I don\u2019t believe in any God, to myself. How\ncan this be, to human beings to be like animals? We\u2019re cattle in the cattle cars,\nand that\u2019s all I was thinking to myself; always thinking. And I says: Jf J ever\nsurvive, I said to myself, Jf I ever survive, I wanna make sure that this \u2019ll never\nhappen again; and with everything I could do. And this came out, and I bring it up\nin the army. I was drafted in the United States Army. I was transferred from\nCamp Gordon, Georgia to Camp Meade in Maryland, in Washington. We were\nworking in a highly classified complex. And there was a ... a Sergeant\nWillingham \u2014 very anti-Semitic \u2014 okay. And there was a Jewish holiday. The\nJewish holiday came out from a Colonel Tullis \u2014 was his name. All Jewish\npersonnel are accused for the Yom Kippur holiday.\nInterviewer: Ex ...

So\nI didn\u2019t know there was two other Jews. All of a sudden I find two other Jews,\none guy from California and one guy from New York. One guy was Levin and\none guy was Morris [sp, ph?]. Typewriter \u2014 they had a typewriter company.\nSergeant Willingham comes out and says: Okay you Dutchman, to me, you are\ngonna work your butts off over the weekend to clean the warehouse. Entire\nwindow \u2014 which is a quarter of a mile long with windows in washing. We\nreported, and we cleaned the windows. And this guy Morris says to me: /\u2019m\ngonna get a box of nails. I\u2019m gonna put his tires; I\u2019m gonna fix him up. | said:\nMorris, you\u2019re not gonna put a nail so long as I am here. Iam going to the\ncolonel; tell him what happened. He wrote the orders, you know; shows you. And\nwhen I was telling this to my wife, I go to the sergeant; I says: J want to speak to\nthe colonel. No, you go to the captain. I go to the captain, I says: Captain, I want\nto speak to the colonel. Can I help you? | says: Captain, I\u2019m sorry, this is the\ncolonel\u2019s problem.\nThe chain of command I went. He had to ... to let me go. The captain tells me; he\nsays: Irving ... Hass, he called me, get yourself nice dressed-up. Make, sure your\nties are right and ... and you\u2019re authorized to see the colonel. The colonel was\ntold \u2019m coming; I\u2019m coming in the office and salute; and says to the colonel:\nColonel, I got a personal problem. Mine friends did not have the guts to come to\nsee you. And I tell him: Colonel, Iam a survivor of the concentration camp. I was\ndrafted in this United States Army, which is a nice country, and I love it, and I\nwould die for it. What\u2019s the problem? I says: Colonel, here is your order. I had a\ncopy of it. You see, I\u2019m from the Jewish faith. You gave us permission to be\nexcused from service ... from the service company to go observe the Yom Kippur\nholiday which is a big holiday. He says: Oh yes, I know Yom Kippur. Sergeant\nWillingham, the following week, made me and my other two friends work in the\nwarehouse cleaning windows for Sundays and Saturdays, two days, because of\nthis. However, Colonel, my Jewish friends did wanna put nails under his tire and\neverything to get even with him. I said no, this got to be in the higher-up. That\u2019s\nall you have to do. The colonel says to: relax soldier and I\u2019m gonna tell you a\nstory, he says to me. You sitting like this now, all relaxed. There is big fish in the\nocean ... small fish. Sometimes the big fish eats up the small fish. There is apples,\nbeautiful apples in a basket. One apple in the middle all of a sudden is rotten. And\nthis rotten basket touches the other; the apple gets rotten. In this man\u2019s army, he\nsaid, there is good people, and there is bad people.

Basic trainings in the schooling, you\nknow, and everything, he says, excellent. I came back in the office. Morris is\nsitting there, and the other guy says: Don\u2019t you ever pick up the phone when it\u2019s\nringing now. You\u2019re gonna hear a ring pretty soon. The phone rings; Sergeant\nWillingham answers it: Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir. He ... the Korean War was on. He\nput him on a levy. Know what the colonel did? Sergeant, you\u2019re gonna be\ntransferred ona ... ona ship, and you\u2019re going to Korea. Willingham comes out,\nand he\u2019s in a transfer; sees me. And he know \u2014 the colonel told him. See this\nlittle guy? he said. This little guy had the guts to come to see me, the colonel told\nto the sergeant. He went through hell in Europe; lost his father and mother and\nsisters. And he had the guts to come and see me; and what you guys did. And I ...\nhe did not \u2014 did he obey you? He says: Sure. The sergeant says: He obeyed your\norders ... my orders. So we obeyed. I says: One thing, we gonna wash the\nwindows, he told us \u2014 we gonna wash the windows.\nAnd that colonel gave me power in my mind. And I was telling this to my\ndaughter too. When she was going to college, she has a problem in college \u2014 you\ngo to the dean. You don\u2019t talk to the little peon. If you have a problem, you go to\nthe top; and he took care of it. And these two guys couldn\u2019t get over, he said: Well\nI did. | says: Don\u2019t answer the phone, let him answer the phone. And he got out of\nthe ... the ... the thing. And that colonel, he says: You know what I am? He says:\nI\u2019m a Catholic \u2014 the colonel. And ... and I know this should not happen in this\nmine ... my man\u2019s army, he said to me. And I says: Colonel, I never refuse\nanything. When I was alive [?], the ... the sergeant picks out people from my\nwhole kommando \u2014 you go on a KP. He comes to me: Hey you \u2019re going on KP.\nAnd all of a sudden, all the guys wanted to stand the back of the row; you know,\nthe guards can\u2019t see \u2014 maybe he doesn\u2019t pick \u2018em. I did KP once, and I worked\nfor about 14 hours; that was my last KP. The sergeant never picked me again. I\nask him: Sergeant why don\u2019t you pick me? He says: You know why? You were\nnever squawked \u2014 to me. I pick a guy, he says, with bi ... bi... bitching ... he\nsays: I did it, you know, and so on. I never squawked; I listened to him, and I\nmeant it. He never picked me on KP again. I could stand in front line \u2014 and\neverything. And I... and I said the same thing to ... to obey. And that\u2019s one, my\nphilosophy.\nAnd then when I start coming a life to go to work, and I sat in the civilian life\nwhen I was working here. I came out of the army. I\u2019m not gonna go back to the\n49\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\ntextile because I saw I have no future. I went to school to learn to read drawings,\nyou know, blueprints. There was an answer in the ... in an ad from a company in\nBunsen [sp, ph?] Road in New York. That was the company; they were making a\nsystem for the Boeing [?] Company. They were architects and making dams and\nmaking shelters for weapons. The guy interviews me and says okay \u2014 I get the\njob. I go into work, and I get the ... work with a guy \u2014 Supervisor ... Zosen [sp,\nph?] was his name. He likes me, and all of a sudden gives me responsibility. We\nbecome a subcontractor to AMF which used to be American Machine and\nFoundry Company, and they were in Brooklyn and Connecticut. And they\nassigned me to work with AMF project, and I speak to the AMF guys and so on.\nAnd the AMF guy says how would you like to work for the AMF? I says I don\u2019t\nmind, if ... if so long it\u2019s in Brooklyn. They send me from Bunsen Road to a\nCanadian company and a job \u2014 to get some information for the Boeing\nCompany. I\u2019m in Canada, and I call up home \u2014 my wife; and my wife says to\nme: You got a telegram. I says: From where is it? From AMF; they offered you a\njob. says: How much? She tells me. I says: You write up a telegram, and say we\nwill accept. Icome ... I... I call in Canada, call my boss from Canada and give\nhim notice. I called the guy in Canada ... from Canada to Bunsen and says: I\u2019m\nleaving in two weeks; I got another job. He says: Where? I says: With AMF. I\u2019m\ngonna work on the same project with you guys \u2014 and I\u2019m gonna be [?] from the\nother side now. So I stay in Brooklyn and work about four weeks; they transfer\nthe project to ... to Greenwich, Connecticut. Here I come here, and I have a car,\nand it\u2019s very far from Brooklyn to go to Greenwich, Connecticut. I go into\npersonnel, and I says: Listen, I can\u2019t do it. They says we get you a car pool.\nPersonnel goes through, and now I got Sheepshead Bay, a guy; I got one in\nCanarsie, I got that. We got a car pool; I didn\u2019t quit my job. Work in Connecticut,\nand then AMF got a big contract with the Air Force, and I make really good\npoints. I like the job, and they like me \u2014 was reading drawings, picking up\nspecial things from the drawings \u2014 tools, and so on \u2014 which I had a ball.\nAnd I liked the company \u2018til somebody, a relative, comes from Cleveland and\noffers me a job in a furniture \u2014 to be a salesman for him. And he offers me nice\nthings and so on. And I live in a little apartment in Brooklyn, and I said, okay, I\u2019m\ngonna accept the job in Cleveland. I come back and get to the girl; /\u2019m going to\ndictate you amemo. And I... [remember it from memory, the memo like this in\nmy memory. And I says: J hereby tender my resignation from such a progressive\ncompany, not for the reason I do not like my job. I gota ... a special offer in a\ndifferent field, and I thank the ... the company for the opportunity they gave me\nand so on. And I copy to personnel and a copy to the vice-president. And the vice-\npresident the next day calls me up. He says: You know, your memo \u2014 the ... the\n50\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nresignation; I never saw it with resignation like this. You know, I gave ... I gave\nthe truth. I liked the company; I told the truth. He says: You know, you\u2019re not\ngonna quit. The vice-president tells me, says: You know, I\u2019m not gonna let you go.\nI\u2019m gonna make you a supervisor \u2014 stay. I come home and tell my wife. I says:\nAnn, he made me a supervisor, and he gave me a raise; and I stay. And I was\ngoing to AMF and working; I became really noticeable. And I don\u2019t have a\ncollege education, everything on my own; and here was technical. Okay, the\nsupervisor had forty people working already. All of a sudden, I... \u2019'm buying a\nhouse in Fairfield, Connecticut \u2014 by the college.\nAMF got more and more jobs. And all of a sudden they got a job on the Titan\nWeapon System, and they pick me to go to Santa Barbara \u2014 relocating. I gave a\ndeposit, they building this house. I run right back, I says, stop. He says I could\ngive you the deposit back \u2014 yes; the company said if ... you lose the deposit,\nwe'll ... we'll pay for it. They transfer me to Santa Barbara, and we did not want\nto move. So \u2019m commuting from Brooklyn to Stamford, Connecticut; from Gren\n... from Greenwich they moved me to Stamford \u2014 it\u2019s another eight miles. Work\nand so on; and everything, you know, and AMF was involved \u2014 my God \u2014\nbowling, you name it. You know, here were ... here were all kind of ... you know\n\u2014 very big company. I got transferred from Brooklyn ... from Stamford to York.\nAnd here 1s the transfer. One day the government has a plant, a Navy facility in\nYork, Pennsylvania. You probably passed it on [Note Route] 30, okay; it was not\n30 then. And I got a package home \u2014 so thick. The vice-president says a letter,\nthis 1s confidential; certain people were selected. You were selected to go to York,\nPennsylvania to prepare a bid. You\u2019re gonna check into this ho ... hotel, and\nyou\u2019re gonna meet some other people. You are sell [?] ... you section is to\nestimate logistics. You know what a word \u2014 logistics?\nInterviewer: Sure.\nIrving Hass: Okay, you said estimate logistics; and do not tell a soul. \u201cOoh\u201d ... and Stamford\nthey say AMF is moving ... nobody ...; leaks got out. The ... the company says\nwe\u2019re not moving. I come, and I did look on the map; I never been in York. I\ncheck into the hotel, and I go through that facility; I never believe it. Oh my God\n\u2014 big; firing range, 360 acres! The plant is now Harley-Davidson. I make up the\npackage; AMF is the lowest bidder ... I mean the highest bidder. Chrysler,\nGeneral Motors, all of them bid for that. We were the highest bidder with 1.4\nmillion. The contract was to get the plant plus 55 million continuation contract.\nWe had to take over about 350 personnel, transferred with the seniority and so on.\nMy job is to read up because they had a logistics department there. We were\npreparing logistic documentation, you know, for service of our logistics ...\n51\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nprepare ser ... service equipment. And I come back; the company announce we\u2019re\nmoving. So they asking me what people would you like from your department to\nmove. The company ... the vice-president asked me; I says I picked cer ... certain\npeople. In a matter of a month, two months, I was already transferred. For about\neight weeks, I was commuting from York, Pennsylvania, that\u2019s why I remember\nthat highway to New York \u2014 the Turnpike and so on. The company paid all the\ncar expenses \u2014 gas, mileage.\nStay in York, Pennsylvania \u2014 we build a house. A house for $21,000, which sells\nfor $150,000 now; sold that time in \u201864. We ... they ... they moved three\ndivisions, AMF did; Thomas Division, the Engineering Division, and the Buffalo\nDivision. We moved on ... we moved on 550 families. You don\u2019t know what this\ntown became. So much business came in from this move. And I was there \u2014 \u2018til\nall of a sudden they transferred me to a different project. One the government\nphased out ... how you gonna be in [?] the LPG project; which is liquid petroleum\ntanks for rural area homes. You know, they\u2019re making this ... the gas ... enough\nfor gas. And then from York, they transferred me to Des Moines, Iowa. That\u2019s\nwhat I says I wind up in Des Moines. Then I was ... in Des Moines I was made\nassistant to the president, and the guy put me in to write procedures of everything\nunder the sun, you know. And that guy was a... he ... he developed the Head\nSki; and he became from Head Ski. AMF bought Head Ski, and he became vice-\npresident. And then he became ... and he says: Irving I went through your folder,\nI want you to work for me. And you talk about people. He says: J like you. You\ncall a spade a spade; and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And my office was outside the\nexecutive office, but you could bust a wall and ... and close up the door, you wind\nup 1n the executive office. Bill Songs [sp, ph?], was his name, calls me in and\nsays, Irving, we\u2019re gonna bust a wall, and we\u2019re gonna share the secretary. He\nissues a memo to the vice-president of operation; two weeks go by \u2014 nobody\u2019s\ncarpenters, no come, no nothing. He calls me in, and he says: /rving, [Note there\nis a loud slap] that door is gonna be busted tonight, and I guarantee you. The\nguys didn\u2019t want ... want me because, you know, there\u2019s jealousy in the company\ngoes around.\nHe move me there next to him, and he assign me to the lawn and garden division\nwhich Sears makes mowers. We make them for a private label. You know the ...\nthe smallest would cut grass \u2014 you could see in my garage, I got all this private\nlabel. And I go through the logistics in Sears. And Sears ... they buy a mower \u2014\nsomething is breaking; they send to the factory to get a washer. The washer costs\n50 cents, and Sears sp ... spends $3 ... to ... the paperwork and $4 to ship; they\nlosing money. And I go into this job, and I say: Oh my gosh, look it \u2014 how many\n52\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\norders are you getting from Sears? The guy says to me: Oh my God, we got 3,000\nthis month. And how much is the total? The 3,000 total about $12,000. I says: You\ncrazy. I go out to Chicago, and I speak to the buyer, and I says: Listen, I\u2019m gonna\nmake an analysis and see what\u2019s going on. In the meantime, I had a good fellow\nworking for me, and I says: Eph [sp, ph?] Jones ... Eph ... you\u2019re gonna come\nwith me to Chicago, and we\u2019re gonna take all the data down. I told Sears that you\nguys are losing money; they ... they pull their hair out. I prove it to them on\ncharts. So here we get away with shipping no more from the factory. Sears had to\nship it to a Philadelphia warehouse, and the warehouse is dealing with the ... with\nthe store. We were dealing with stores, you know, with ... with the customer; and\nI made a change on that.\nAnother change come in. The ... the boss got promoted; He takes overa... a\nbicycle division in Little Rock, Arkansas and a division in California. And comes\nin; he says: Irving, you\u2019re going to Arkansas. To Arkansas? Not me! And I tell\nyou, that\u2019s where I wind up with my life in there. In all the time in my life, when\nmy daughter used to see this, and I used to tell her: Go to the top, learn \u2014\nimportant things. And that\u2019s why I always with the supervisors \u2014 never. And I...\nI .... People know where you stay. We had in New York, a lieutenant general was\n... which is ... was the Chairman of the Board\u2019s buddy; he gave him a job. He\nwants to fish out who is a supervisor, who\u2019s not a supervisor. Fishing out, you\nknow \u2014 wants to know if he have the brains to be a supervisor. In one brain, he\ndid, he came in nine o\u2019clock with a package. He says to me: Your work are\nneeded immediately. Nine-thirty he cames with another package. J need this in 30\nminutes. Ten-thirty he cames in with another package; and here I got two\npackages I couldn\u2019t say. I look at one package, he says with credit \u2014 no. I look\nfor another package \u2014 1s it a question some manual data \u2014 no. The third package\nhas to do, if I furnish this information, we will furnish you an order, you know, of\nso and so. I took the order package first \u2014 he gave me the last \u2014 to do the job. I\nfinished it, he calls me in. He says: You seem, Hass, to me the general [\u2019]. I gave\nthis package, was to nine people. Everybody still working on package one. You\ngot package three, which one I needed. Why ... why did I get package three? |\nsays: It\u2019s more important because there ... there\u2019s gonna be an order from it.\nPackage ... the first is on credit, you know the guy\u2019s waited so long for credit; he\nwait another ten days, it\u2019s not gonna hurt. And that\u2019s why the guy wanted to fish\nout; if you have authority. Then I used to go to seminars. At seminars, the guy\nwas teaching the same thing. A-B-C he says, assert yourself management\nseminars. He says assert yourself everything, A-B-C.\nInterviewer: So this 1s the kind of thinking ...\n53\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n[Interviewer and Irving Hass talking over each other]\nIrving Hass: This is the kind of thinking, and that\u2019s why I sur ...\nInterviewer: ... that helped you survive?\nIrving Hass: _... survived in Auschwitz \u2014 because of this. Right away, I don\u2019t know what got\nin to me or something from my father. I could not stand. I was right away in that\n...5 1... [thought to myself it\u2019s gonna be better, whatever happens.\nInterviewer: What was on your father\u2019s mind, as far as you can tell?\nIrving Hass: My father\u2019s mind, he knew right away he\u2019s gonna ... he ... this is gonna be of ...\nof ... of last. He said it in the railroad car.\nInterviewer: When you got in the car?\nIrving Hass: In the car, he says to his friend there, talking. He says: Binyamin [sp, ph?] ...\nInterviewer: He fears the worst.\nIrving Hass: Binyamin, he said, what\u2019s gonna happen? He called him and said: You know\nwhat\u2019s gonna happen. I don\u2019t trust the Germans. And he knows that from the\nFirst War were the same thing \u2014 they took us to Russia; and all of a sudden \u2014\ntell you \u2014 some of them survived, some of them \u2014 they were killed in the First\nWar. And who my fath ... father to wind up in Tashkent from ... from Ruscova\n\u2014 sent Tashkent; which is 4,000 miles or something. And ... and he knew right\naway.\nInterviewer: So he thought you would all be killed?\nIrving Hass: He thought...\nInterviewer: ... everybody would be killed.\n[Interviewer is talking over Irving. |\nIrving Hass: He thought we\u2019re all gonna be killed, and he says to me bef ...\u2014 in the railroad\ncar \u2014 one word I could never forget. Whatever happen to me, he says, don\u2019t lose\nyour religion \u2014 to me \u2014 whatever happen in the ... in the camp. I said to myself:\nThere\u2019s no God. I\u2019m not gonna believe in God.\nInterviewer: This is when you were in the cattle car?\nIrving Hass: Inthe... inthe cattle .... In the ... yeah.\n54\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n[Interviewer and Irving talking over each other. ]\nInterviewer: When you questioned God\u2019s existence?\nIrving Hass: Yeah, in the ... in the concentration camp; not in the cattle car.\nInterviewer: The cattle car you ...\nIrving Hass: Was still ...\nInterviewer: You still believed in God?\nIrving Hass: Was still believed in God. But when I was in the camp, I said there\u2019s no God. I...\nI don\u2019t believe it. God cannot see people suffering no matter who you are, what\nreligion; I says no. And then I saw, when after I got separated, I came to New\nYork. I says listen, maybe God gave this [?] because he punished us. And \u2019'm\nback, and that\u2019s what I tried to teach my children.\nInterviewer: So you did listen to your father in the end?\nIrving Hass: So I did listen; that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Did listen to my father, and my father said:\nNo matter what you do, this is gonna bring you back to life. And know 1... I had\nbad days, and ... and sometime I could\u2019ve got killed \u2014 with a car. We ... we\nwere almost, you know, terrible \u2014 and I saw my father in front of me.\nInterviewer: So your father thought the Germans would kill everybody?\nIrving Hass He... he... I would say he knew this. He knew this in his heart. Because the First\nWorld War told him what ... what happens \u2014 it\u2019s a war. Because he knew\nAmerica was involved; and it\u2019s not gonna be easy to hold America, France, and\nEngland and so on.\nInterviewer: What about your mother? What did ... [unintelligible]?\nIrving Hass: My mother was not ... not more like this. Like I said, my mother was a gentle\nlady, knows how to take care of the family, you know, and everything; but never\nknew politics or ... or business type.\nInterviewer: But on this deportation in the train ... to Auschwitz, what ...\n[Interviewer and Irving talking over each other. ]\nIrving Hass: In the deportation she was only crying. My mother was crying and everything. I\nsays: I wish we were going to see it and everything, you know. And hugged me in\nthe railroad car; oh my God, she must have hugged me hundreds of times.\n55\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nInterviewer: She must have hugged all the kids.\nIrving Hass: Really I can\u2019t ever forget. That\u2019s why I... I... when I see a movie, and 1... told\nmy wife, it\u2019s about a concentration camp \u2014 don\u2019t watch it. I says: No, I\u2019m gonna\nwatch it, because that is in my heart. I got to \u2014 nobody should forget. And the\nHolocaust Memorial is the greatest thing we ever did.\nInterviewer: Could you get ...? You never had a chance to say goodbye to your sisters?\nIrving Hass: No. I just pulled away the guy, and that\u2019s it. And I don\u2019t ... I\u2019m saying from ...\nmy family, one would survive \u2014 nobody ... from my family. ... [unintelligible].\nAnd when I met my wife, she\u2019s a ... was an orphan; her mother died. And she\nwas in high school. And it\u2019s a ... also a miracle I went up ... to camp. In the\ncamp, I... I got to there, two weeks they got free vacation for me \u2014 from the\norganization. Lehman ... the Governor Lehman donated a camp for orphans and\nso on, children \u2014 non-sectarian, Jewish and non-Jewish. OK there\u2019s really ... I\nmet some nice people out there. AndI... I... I checked in, and I saw this girl.\nThe minute I saw her .... I didn\u2019t have a steady ... I mean a good-paying job \u2014\ndidn\u2019t have a thing. And I said to uncle and aunt, I says: J can\u2019t marry, what am I\ngoing to do? He says: Don\u2019t worry, marriage brings luck, whatever. And ... so I\ndropped her. Three weeks later, she called up and asked what happened. He didn\u2019t\n... [didn\u2019t call her. I says: You know, I ... I cannot. And then I called her from\nthen on. I just ... [had a ring which I brought from Germany \u2014 a little ring \u2014\nand I... gave it to her; I says: We\u2019re engaged. And then my uncle and aunt, with\nthe family, planned a wedding. And ... I got married in ... in Henington Hall in\nthe East Side.\nAnd ... and ... and that\u2019s why ... that\u2019s why now which I read in the paper and I\nsee in television, people don\u2019t say there is no ... Holocaust. How can a person say\nwhich people come in today\u2019s world; which I would only able to talk to him and\nshow him a picture that I went through this? And I have seen this, and you tell me\nthere is so in California pictures, there never was a Holocaust. Where is my town\nof 300 people? Maybe the entire town, maybe 12 or 14 survived. I don\u2019t think we\nhave twelve ... from the entire town of 300 families. And this is an outrageous.\nAnd this Holocaust Memorial should be really built that should be stand for\nhundreds of years. I know the ... the data what they ... what you accumulate\nshould be there for hundreds of years. Generations should come; generation,\ngeneration to follow.\nInterviewer: Let\u2019s hope so.\nIrving Hass: SoIreally ... I really; it\u2019s really bad.\n56\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\nInterviewer: Do you have anything else to say?\nIrving Hass: The only thing I can say, I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity.\nInterviewer: Thank you, I appreciate it, and I thank you.\nIrving Hass: AndI... I really thank the organization. Whatever happens, I\u2019m really happy.\nInterviewer: I thank you on behalf of the Holocaust Museum.\nIrving Hass: Thank you.\n57\n",
