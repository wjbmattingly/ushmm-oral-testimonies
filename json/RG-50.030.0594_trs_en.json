Very, very quickly, I was beaten during that time period and \u2014 because the other boys asked me what I was, who I was, and th-the minute I said Jew, I was put to the test immediately. And my mother was called to school, she was told by the principal of the school that it would be best for my \u2014 my protection to be taken out of that school.

            "answer": "I think my parents tried to protect me by not saying much of anything. And I was never told what to say or what not to say. But I think I, from that experience, I learned rather quickly as to what I was, who I was. And I think my parents shielded me from all the discriminatory acts that had been ongoing in the mid-1930s. For example, I had an uncle of mine, a brother of my \u2014 of my \u2014 my mother, who was a very successful attorney in Germany and Berlin. And of course he was \u2014 you know, I found out later on why he wasn\u2019t working any more, because he was excluded from \u2014 from that possibility.

So yes, I \u2014 I- I think that\u2019s the \u2014 the only person that I \u2014 that I have recog \u2014 I have a memory thereof. When we \u2014 when we left Berlin, we had \u2014 when we \u2014 I should sa \u2014 correct this; when children were fortunate enough to leave school, to go out of the country in some fashion or other, we would all have little autograph books and we would sign off on a little note to that st \u2014 t-to that boy or girl. Maybe it was just putting our name and saying in German, best wishes for the future, maybe a little poem, maybe a little picture. But I do have a book like that at home, with about \u2014 the names of about maybe 15 to 20 different students, and \u2014 and likewise a \u2014 a number of teachers who \u2014 whose classes I attended, wishing me well."

My parents were no longer able to subdue their \u2014 their thoughts as to trying to shield and protect me. And I do remember very clearly that either with my father or my mother, I went to a grocery store nearby, and the \u2014 the merchant, the owner of that establishment, who knew my parents, looked at me with my blond hair at that time, and said, he doesn\u2019t look like a Jew. And that scared the hell out of me, because I knew what that meant. And then in 1938, obviously the \u2014 my father and \u2014 and I, every Sunday would go to a park that was like two or three minutes away from our home, and we would sit on the bench and my father would schmooze, if that\u2019s the correct word, with neighbors who would come by. And my father delighted in showing me off as \u2014 as his son, and \u2014 and then one day we could no longer sit on the park bench, we had to sit on a\u2014 on a yellow bench, which said, nur fir Juden, for Jews only.

Kristallnacht was November 9\", 1938, and I don\u2019t know the reasons for it, but in \u2014 sometime in December of 1938, on a winter day, I was walking with my sister, not far from \u2014 from where our apartment was, and something within me, I lashed out \u2014 physically I lashed out at a Interview with John Lang \" October 15, 2010 \u2014 at a member of the Hitler youth who was collecting money for whatever, whatever the purpose was, I have no idea, okay, for whatever the Hitler youth was collecting money for. And when I say lashed out, I\u2019m talking about physically assaulted. And inflicted damage to the uniform, inflicted damage to that person. My sister dragged me home, told my \u2014 my \u2014 my parents. I guess they found out very quickly who it was, that individual that I had accosted. I cannot give you the reason for it, I don\u2019t know. And at that juncture, the \u2014 my p \u2014 my parents, my mother, contacted the parents of this individual. I can\u2019t even tell you whether it was male or female that I accosted, but I do know the individual was a good \u2014 good head taller than I was. That I can tell you. My mother promised to pay whatever damages they \u2014 they wanted to have for this incident not to be reported to the Hitler youth leader, which could possibly lead to my being taken away permanently. That did not happen, and a week or two later, I found myself with my mother. We went to what\u2019s considered a court in this \u2014 in this Hitler youth leader\u2019s home, where I was going to be judged one way or the other. Either I wasn\u2019t coming home, or something would happen. And I guess my mother gave me my life for the second time."

An eight year old 1s not told too much, an eight year old, and maybe today they are, but in those times an eight year is told what to do and when to do it and how to do it. And at that point, I am sure my mother and father must have thought how they were going to get me out of \u2014 out of Berlin, and do it fast, before anything changes, before \u2014 before somebody in the Hitler youth group that had decided \u2014 by the way, my \u2014 my parents, my mother dis \u2014 paid a \u2014 a very substantial fine, I was told \u2014 before someone changed their mind. I think that \u2014 my guesstimate is that I got onto the Kindertransport list possibly a little faster, and maybe I got onto the list at all because of \u2014 of this terrible incident. And I left \u2014 I left Berlin sometime in \u2014 Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 towards the end of January.

My \u2014 my parents, or my mother had a third or fourth cousin living in America, somebody who I\u2019d never met, somebody whose name I\u2019d never heard of before. But anyway, they had given us the affidavit to come to America. What was lacking to come to America was the quota number, because my parents, my mother, my father, I guess, always believed to the end that things would not get to that point in time. So we \u2014 we had the affidavit, but no quota number to come to America. Had we stayed and had I stayed in \u2014 in England \u2014 or had I stayed in, excuse me, had I stayed in Germany for my quota number to appear from the American consulate there, I would have been dead. So I went to England, and my \u2014 my \u2014 my family did have \u2014 did have \u2014 we did have family in \u2014 in England, but I was bounced around all over the place in \u2014 in \u2014 in England, including I lived with a wonderful Christian family in a small town about two and a half hours north of London for about half a year or so, and went to church with them. They shared what they shared with \u2014 whatever they had they shared with me. They were wonderful, caring, giving people, and only a year ago, did I lose contact Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with John Lang ot October 15, 2010 with \u2014 with that family. We would exchange Christmas cards or Thanksgiving cards, and it was only last year that I finally failed to get a card, and that \u2014 as a matter of fact, only recently, I wrote to the ca \u2014 the municipality, asking whether they had any records as to what might have happened to this, you know, person of that \u2014 of that family. So I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m very, very grateful. And you should know Kindertransport, I mean, people tell you, Kindertransport came about because of a group of Quakers persuading Parliament to take action, and \u2014 which \u2014 that allowed 10,000 un-unaccompanied children to enter England. So Christians have been very, very good to me, and | have a great love and admiration for \u2014 for Christians. And to this day, where I participate in a lot of Christian activities."

All the other names were there, and I started to cry, because I knew down deep in my heart, that if I didn\u2019t get out, 1t would cost me my life. Now that\u2019s a hell of a thought for an eight year old to have, but those were my thoughts. And \u2014 and I cried, and my mother and father who I re \u2014 I already separated from, they were standing on one side, and I was on the other side, we had already had our goodbyes.

You know, it Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with John Lang 7 October 15, 2010 was \u2014 it was sad news for me, but what was sad really was \u2014 the saddest moment for me in England really was separation from my father, because at that point when \u2014 when I was supposed to come to America, I was taken to the hospital.

My father was told that I was going to America the following day, and this would be the last time that he would \u2014 that I would be in his presence, or that I would be able to see him. And ... my father placed his hand on my \u2014 on my head. I didn\u2019t know what that meant, and \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have \u2014 eight, nine year olds, 10 year olds, don\u2019t ask anything, we just listen. And then, when I was 13, I was Bar Mitzvahed in New York, and a rabbi put his hand on my head, and I knew what my father was doing. That probably was the saddest day that I had in England. And my mother came to America. My mother stayed in \u2014 in England with my father obviously, to the end, which was maybe a half a year or so after I came to America. At that time, even as I came to America on a ship \u2014 and I have the \u2014 the boarding pass still at home, and I even have a picture of the ship which one of my assistants dredged up for me from the internet. That was a ship that took me from Liverpool to Montreal. Took about 10 days, 10 12 days. We were in a convoy for about the first two or three days. We were a relatively modest sized ship, passenger cargo ship. Had a \u2014 as I said, a convoy for the first two or three days\u2019 time, which you \u2014 where you felt relatively safe, because Interview with John Lang *\u00b0 October 15, 2010 the destroyers were throwing depth charges around, and you never knew whether they were firing at somebody \u2014 something 1n reality, or just as a \u2014 a precaution. And then maybe on the the third or fourth day, the convoy was gone, and you were alone. And there you were in the north Atlantic, and as I found out later on, maybe only 30 or 40 percent of the ships that sailed on the north Atlantic during that time period actually got through. I was de \u2014 certainly much aware of the fact that the chances of getting through were \u2014 were at best 50 \u2014 50, and a life jacket was something that was on me continuously, but hell, if that ship was torpedoed, I knew that we were gone, all of us were gone."

How much did you know in advance that you were able to \u2014 to do this and where were you spatially, were you still living at your uncles? Were the bombs coming down, did you need to go underground? Can you describe that for me?",
            "answer": "I\u2019m going to take it back to Kristallnacht. I was eight years, eight and a half years old on November eighth. On November ninth I was 18 years old. I had peripheral vision at that point. I could see what was going on. I had fear built into me. There wasn\u2019t anything that I was not prepared to do or see. So I did not \u2014 I was Interview with John Lang \u201d October 15, 2010 not any more \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to use the word normal, I was not normal any more at that time.

During the time period of the London blitz, I was with \u2014 I lived with my \u2014 with my mother and father, and it was my \u2014 there was \u2014 the blitz started every \u2014 every evening, every night time from \u2014 from as soon as it got dark, til early in the morning, four or five hours of intense bombing. It was unbelievable. As I said the \u2014 you know, you could hear the \u2014 the roar of the planes, it was \u2014 it was frightening, it was dreadful. In the morning you could see the glow, you could s \u2014 buildings would shake around us. You could see buildings that had been b-bombed out, you could see fires on the street. All the \u2014 all the wreckage \u2014 the only thing that was not wrecked was the spirit of the London people, who always remained calm, and had their brooms in hand to tidy up the best way they could. They were \u2014 they were miraculous. Absolutely miraculous. Once in a while we did s-sleep in the \u2014 in the underground, which was deep underground. Underground being subway, but which protected us from \u2014 from bombs up above. And once in a while \u2014 actually I remember one day when I went to school, that the air raids started in \u2014 in the day time, and that was unusual because most of the bombing runs, the air raids started in the \u2014 1n the early Interview with John Lang \" October 15, 2010 evening. And at that point I was in a bomb shelter from early in the morning to middle of the afternoon. I rushed home, and within an hour later, I was back in the bomb shelter. So I spent maybe 20 hours that day in various bomb shelters. So I don\u2019t get too excited any more about people saying that you know, you don\u2019t know \u2014 you don\u2019t know what it like \u2014 what it\u2019s like being bombed, I certainly do know what it\u2019s like. And I do know what it means to have four or five, six, seven, 800 planes overhead in London, bombing the \u2014 the [indecipherable] city to daylights. Was unbel \u2014 unbelievable. And then one \u2014 one day I was told by my mother that \u2014 that my papers had \u2014 that our papers had come due to come to America, and I gather they came due faster than \u2014 than people had thought. Because basically, people were being eradicated, or people were not able to leave Germany because of the war, they had \u2014 they \u2014 they might have had papers also, or they were in concentration camps now, and as a result our \u2014 our number \u2014 our quota number came up somewhat faster than \u2014 that had been an-anticipated, and say my \u2014 our quota number came up in September, October of 1940, and that\u2019s when I exited from \u2014 from \u2014 from \u2014 from London.

And that\u2019s where I was bound for. So I landed in Montreal. I should tell you when we \u2014 when I \u2014 the 10 hours or so, six hours prior to landing, somebody \u2014 somebody said, it smells differently. And it does smell differently on the water, when land is nearby. And ultimately somebody said, land. And you couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t believe the cheers that went up from all the people on deck.

And ships actually were torpedoed closer, I found out later on. And we \u2014 we went to \u2014 to Montreal, exited the ship in Montreal, took a train from Montreal to New York, and we \u2014 we was welcomed by my uncle and aunt, as I said, third \u2014 third or fourth cousins, who welcomed me to New York and tried to, you know, who accepted me, who \u2014 who cared \u2014 who had no other children, who cared for me. They had very limited means. My \u2014 my uncle was \u2014 these \u2014 these people had a \u2014 a small dry goods \u2014 they had a successful dry goods operation in Germany, I\u2019m not quite sure where, I think in Stettin.

And I would help Interview with John Lang \u201c October 15, 2010 her to embroider these sweaters, and a result, at the end of the week I would get my dime allowance, and I would spend that on the movies. And after I felt a little bit sure of myself, I would use some of that money for a comic book. And I graduated from \u2014 once I \u2014 once I mastered the art of comic books, I then graduated to real books, and that\u2019s how I learned to read, write. I had some wonderful teachers in \u2014 in New York, the first school I went to, who decided I would \u2014 should go back a grade, should be set back so I wouldn\u2019t have the pressure to perform.

And I insist that we always, that anybody who\u2019s with me, knows that we're going to services. And I'll tell you also something special. There\u2019s a synagogue in Berlin, it\u2019s not very f\u2014 not f \u2014 it\u2019s within walking distance of the \u2014 of the Kempinski Hotel on Kurfuirstendamm, that \u2014 we go to 10 services.

As a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 result, the synagogue was ransacked, but not burned down, because had it been torched, buildings and surrounding buildings would have also gone down; they weren\u2019t going to do that. I found out later on here in the U.S. from my sister that that was a synagogue that my uncle, a \u2014 a brother of my father, had been the president of in 1930s. And from a diary, from a written diary of my grandfather, that my grandfather wrote that he celebrated his 75\" birthday in that particular synagogue. I want you to know that I too celebrated my 75\" birthday in that synagogue and was called to the Torah."

And the borough had placed two large wreaths on \u2014 on the site, on \u2014 on the \u2014 on \u2014 yeah, anniversary of Kristallnacht. And I spoke to my \u2014 my children and my \u2014 my granddaughter, exactly what I\u2019d experienced. Within \u2014 within seconds, I had a group of German citizens who lived in \u2014 right there, came \u2014 came around and listened to me. And one woman came with a memorial candle that she lit.

And a Christian group, again Christian, okay? They are so important in my life. A Christian group in \u2014 in \u2014 in my area had set up a storefront and boarded it up and put on a Star of David, and c-call it Jude, and \u2014 and desecrated the front of a \u2014 of a storefront as a kind of a replica as to what we had endured during that time period. And I found that touching. And as my \u2014 my wife said, on the lampposts around \u2014 around the park where we lived, there were signs as to what had transpired against Jews in that period. What I also found very interesting is that two blocks away from where we lived \u2014 and my parents never told me this, I\u2014 Albert Einstein lived. Okay? And there\u2019s a large \u2014 a large stone \u2014 I can\u2019t say a memorial, what do you \u2014 lar \u2014 large \u2014 a very, very large stone plaque that this was the residence of Albert Einstein. I said, my God, I never knew that I lived in such a \u2014 such a prestigious neighborhood. But \u2014 but \u2014 but ger \u2014 German \u2014 German citizens are much more aware \u2014 I \u2014 I think \u2014 my gut feeling tells me that the Holocaust will be \u2014 will be nothing other than a museum piece in years to come, that who knows whether even our Jewish grandchildren or their children will have knowledge of the Holocaust? I think it\u2019s going to \u2014 I think \u2014 I think it will disappear in time, and you will \u2014 you will stay around. When I say you, I\u2019m talking about the Holocaust Museum, and maybe a couple of other ones wi-will stay Interview with John Lang \" October 15, 2010 around. But I \u2014 we\u2019ll se \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I see that in the next 10 years town, some of the Holocaust centers, unless they\u2019re well-endowed, will not make it. Because that generation that has supported them will no longer be there, and the next generation will not ha \u2014 will not step up to the plate. A2: But the German schools are actively teaching the Holocaust. ",
                " There is nobody \u2014 there is nobody that is \u2014 maybe that\u2019s why I have a great affinity for Germany at this time, because number one, I can say I have survived, and the others are dead, because they \u2014 they have passed on, and it\u2019s a new generation of Germans. And that\u2019s why I c \u2014I get along with \u2014 wa \u2014 you know, I get along on a first name basis with the consul general, and with other Germans, I \u2014 I greet them. They are, as far as I\u2019m concerned, part of \u2014 part of my life, part of a new life. Lot of \u2014 lot of my generation cannot, have not, will not say what I\u2019ve just sa \u2014 told you. They will live in the past and say they will never forgive or forget. I can never forgive and forget, but I can move on. And maybe that\u2019s why life has also been somewhat more successful for me than maybe some other people, because I\u2019ve always believed in looking \u2014 1n \u2014 1n being a forward-looking person.
