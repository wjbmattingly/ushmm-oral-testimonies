For example, I had an uncle of mine, a brothe r of my \u0152 of my \u0152 my mother, who was a very successful attorney in Germany and Berlin. And of course he was \u0152 you know, I found out later on why he wasn\u2122t working any more, because he was excluded from \u0152 from that possibility.

Maybe it was just putting our name and saying in German, best wishes for the future, maybe a little poem, maybe a little picture.

Kristallnacht was November 9th, 1938, and I don\u2122t know the reasons for it, but in \u0152 sometime in December of 1938, on a winter day, I was walking with my sister, not far from \u0152 from where our apartment was, and something within me, I lashed out \u0152 physically I lashed out at a Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 18\u0152 at a member of the Hitler youth who was collecting money for whatever, whatever the purpose was, I have no idea, okay, for whatever the Hitler youth was collecting money for. And when I say lash ed out, I\u2122m talking about physically assaulted. And inflicted damage to the uniform, inflicted damage to that person. My sister dragged me home, told my \u0152 my \u0152 my parents. I guess th ey found out very quickly who it was, that individual that I had accosted. I cannot give you the reason for it, I don\u2122t know. And at that juncture, the \u0152 my p \u0152 my parents, my mother, contacted the parents of this individual. I can\u2122t even tell you whether it was male or female that I accosted, but I do know the individual was a good \u0152 good head taller than I was. That I can tell you. My mother promised to pay whatever damages they \u0152 they wanted to have for this incident not to be reported to the Hitler youth leader, which could possibly lead to my being taken away permanently. That did not happen, and a week or two later, I found myself with my mother. We went to what\u2122s considered a court in this \u0152 in this Hitler youth leader\u2122s home, where I was going to be judged one way or the ot her. Either I wasn\u2122t coming home, or something would happen. And I guess my mother gave me my life for the second time."

An eight year old is not told too much, an eight year old, and maybe today they are, but in those times an eight year is told what to do and when to do it and how to do it. And at that point, I am sure my mother and father must have thought how they were going to get me out of \u0152 out of Berlin, and do it fast, before anything changes, before \u0152 before somebody in the Hitler youth group that had decide d \u0152 by the way, my \u0152 my parents, my mother dis \u0152 paid a \u0152 a very substantial fine, I was told \u0152 before someone changed their mind. I think that \u0152 my guesstimate is that I got onto the Kindertransport list possibly a little faster, and maybe I got onto the list at all because of \u0152 of this terrible incident.

My \u0152 my parents, or my mother had a third or fourth cousin living in America, somebody who I\u2122d never met, somebody whose name I\u2122d never heard of before. But anyway, they had given us the affidavit to come to America. What was lacking to come to America was the quota number, because my parents, my mother, my father, I guess, always believed to the end that things would not get to that point in time. So we \u0152 we ha d the affidavit, but no quota number to come to America. Had we stayed and had I stayed in \u0152 in England \u0152 or had I stayed in, excuse me, had I stayed in Germany for my quota number to appear from the American consulate there, I would have been dead. So I went to England, and my \u0152 my \u0152 my family did have \u0152 did have \u0152 we did have family in \u0152 in England, but I was bounced around all over the place in \u0152 in \u0152 in England , including I lived with a wonderful Christian family in a small town about two and a half hours north of London for about half a year or so, and went to church with them. They shared what they shared with \u0152 whatever they had they shared with me. They were wonderful, caring, giving people , and only a year ago, did I lose contact Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 21with \u0152 with that family. We would exch ange Christmas cards or Thanksgiving cards, and it was only last year that I fina lly failed to get a card, and that \u0152 as a matter of fact, only recently, I wrote to the ca \u0152 the municipality, asking whether they had any records as to what might ha ve happened to this, you know, person of that \u0152 of that family. So I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m very, very grateful. And you should know Kindertransport, I mean, people tell you, Kindertransport came about because of a group of Quakers persuading Parliament to take action, and \u0152 which \u0152 that allowed 10,000 un-unaccompa nied children to enter England. So Christians have been very, very good to me, and I have a great love and admiration for \u0152 for Christians. And to this day, where I participate in a lot of Christian activities."

I remember one afternoon I was so distraught that I went to a nearby park and I sat down and I start to cry. I didn\u2122t know what the hell else to do.

You know, it Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 37was \u0152 it was sad news for me, but what was sad really was \u0152 the saddest moment for me in England really was separation from my father, because at that point when \u0152 when I was suppos ed to come to America, I was taken to the hospital.

My father was told that I was going to America the following day, and this would be the last time that he would \u0152 that I would be in his presence, or that I would be able to see him. And \u2013 my father placed his hand on my \u0152 on my head. I didn\u2122t know what that meant, and \u0152 and I didn\u2122t have \u0152 eight, nine year olds, 10 year olds, don\u2122t ask anything, we just listen. And then, when I was 13, I was Bar Mitzvahed in New York, and a rabbi put his hand on my head, and I knew what my father was doing. That probably was the saddest day that I had in England . And my mother came to America. My mother stayed in \u0152 in England with my father obviously, to the end, which was maybe a half a year or so after I came to America. At that time, even as I came to America on a ship \u0152 and I have the \u0152 the boarding pass still at home, and I even have a picture of the ship which one of my assist ants dredged up for me from the internet. That was a ship that took me from Liverpool to Montreal . Took about 10 days, 10 - 12 days. We were in a convoy for about the first two or three days. We were a relatively modest sized ship, passenger cargo ship. Had a \u0152 as I said, a convoy for the first two or three days\u2122 time, which y ou \u0152 where you felt relatively safe, because Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 38the destroyers were throwing depth char ges around, and you never knew whether they were firing at somebody \u0152 something in reality, or just as a \u0152 a precaution. And then maybe on the the third or fourth day, the convoy was gone, and you were alone. And there you were in the north Atlantic , and as I found out later on, maybe only 30 or 40 percent of the ships that sailed on the north Atlantic during that time period actually got through. I was de \u0152 certainly much aware of the fact that the chances of getting through we re \u0152 were at best 50 \u0152 50, and a life jacket was something that was on me continuously, but he ll, if that ship was torpedoed, I knew that we were gone, all of us were gone."

I had peripheral vision at that point. I could see what was going on. I had fear built into me. There wasn\u2122t anything that I was not prep ared to do or see. So I did not \u0152 I was Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 39not any more \u0152 and I don\u2122t want to use th e word normal, I was not normal any more at that time.

During the time period of the London blitz, I was with \u0152 I lived with my \u0152 with my mother and father, and it was my \u0152 there was \u0152 the blitz started every \u0152 every evening, every night time from \u0152 from as soon as it got dark, til early in the morning, four or five hours of intense bombing. It was unbelievabl e. As I said the \u0152 you know, you could hear the \u0152 the roar of the planes, it was \u0152 it was frightening, it was dreadful. In the morning you could see the glow, you coul d s \u0152 buildings woul d shake around us. You could see buildings that had been b-bombed out, you could see fires on the street. All the \u0152 all the wreckage \u0152 the only thing that was not wrecked was the spirit of the London people, who always remained calm, and had their brooms in hand to tidy up the best way they could. They were \u0152 they were miraculous. Absolutely miraculous. Once in a while we did s-sleep in the \u0152 in the underground, which was deep underground. Underground being subway, but which protected us from \u0152 from bombs up above. And once in a while \u0152 actually I remember one day when I went to school, that the air raids st arted in \u0152 in the day time, and that was unusual because most of the bombing runs, the air raids started in the \u0152 in the early Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 40evening. And at that point I was in a bomb shelter from early in the morning to middle of the afternoon. I rushed home, and within an hour later, I was back in the bomb shelter. So I spent maybe 20 hours th at day in various bomb shelters.

And I do know what it means to have four or five, six, seven, 800 planes overhead in London, bombing the \u0152 the [indecipherable] city to daylights. Was unbel \u0152 unbelievable. And then one \u0152 one day I was told by my mother that \u0152 that my papers had \u0152 that our papers had come due to come to America, and I gather they came due faster than \u0152 than people had thought. Because basically, people were being eradicated, or people were not able to leave Germany because of the war, they had \u0152 they \u0152 they might ha ve had papers also, or they were in concentration camps now, and as a resu lt our \u0152 our number \u0152 our quota number came up somewhat faster than \u0152 that had been an-anticipated, and say my \u0152 our quota number came up in September, October of 1940, and that\u2122s when I exited from \u0152 from \u0152 from \u0152 from London .

I should tell you when we \u0152 when I \u0152 the 10 hours or so, six hours prior to landing, somebody \u0152 somebody said, it smells differently. And it does smell differently on the water, when land is nearby. And ultimately somebody said, land.

And we \u0152 we went to \u0152 to Montreal , exited the ship in Montreal, took a train from Montreal to New York , and we \u0152 we was welcomed by my uncle and aunt, as I said, third \u0152 third or f ourth cousins, who welcomed me to New York and tried to, you know, who accepted me, who \u0152 who cared \u0152 who had no other children, who cared for me. They had ve ry limited means. My \u0152 my uncle was \u0152 these \u0152 these people had a \u0152 a small dry goods \u0152 they had a successful dry goods operation in Germany, I\u2122m not quite sure where, I think in Stettin.

My aunt did something that you probably don\u2122t even know, called piecework. Wa \u0152 were \u0152 meaning that she embroidered sweaters. And I would help Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 43her to embroider these sweaters, and a result, at the end of the week I would get my dime allowance, and I would spend that on the movies.

And I graduated from \u0152 once I \u0152 once I mastered the art of comic books, I then graduated to real books, and that\u2122s how I learned to read, write.

Obviously I-I gravitated to some children, Jewish children that were in my school to play with after \u0152 after hours. You know, we play on the street a nd play some games.

And one of them said, well why don\u2122t you come up, my \u0152 my parents would like to meet you. So I we nt upstairs to their apartment, and spoke to the parents, father, and again I repeated, you know, my \u0152 what we had gone through, and what life was like.

And from that point on I gravi \u0152 I stayed away from Jewish children altogether. And my best friend during this time period, that was New York, before I moved elsewhere, was a Methodist family, who almost adopted me. Took me wi \u0152 on \u0152 I lived with them after school, and observed holidays, they bought gifts for me at Christmastime. They made me feel as part of the family. They were Methodists. And again, non-Jews had more compassion for Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 45me than Jewish people. And that Jewish people here in New York could not have it, could not find it in their hearts to believe what I was talking about, I found it indescribable. It \u0152 it really was destroying to me.

And an uncle \u0152 another uncle of mine, during this time period had \u0152 had gone \u0152 had emigrated from Berlin to London and then from London to California, and it was decided that I would move to California.

I learned how to live \u0152 I learned how to ta lk with people, and I learned something about finance in my \u0152 in that early age, because I \u0152 my \u0152 my uncle would be glued to the \u0152 to the \u0152 to the radio every afternoon to listen to the outcome of the financial markets.

And I insist that we always, that anybody who\u2122s with me, knows that we\u2122re going to services. And I\u2122ll tell you also something special. There\u2122s a synagogue in Berlin, it\u2122s not very f \u0152 not f \u0152 it\u2122s within walking distance of the \u0152 of the Kempinski Hotel on Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, that \u0152 we go to 10 services. That synagogue sits within a courtyard of apartment dwellings, apartment buildings. As a Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 58result, the synagogue was ransacked, but not burned do wn, because had it been torched, buildings and surrounding buildings would have also gone down; they weren\u2122t going to do that. I found out later on here in the U.S. from my sister that that was a synagogue that my uncle, a \u0152 a brother of my father, had been the president of in 1930s. And from a diary, from a written diary of my grandfather, that my grandfather wrote that he celebrated his 75 th birthday in that particular synagogue. I want you to know that I too celebrated my 75 th birthday in that synagogue and was called to the Torah."

And I spoke to my \u0152 my children and my \u0152 my grandda ughter, exactly what I\u2122d experienced. Within \u0152 within seconds, I had a group of German citizens who lived in \u0152 right there, came \u0152 came around and listened to me. And one woman came with a memorial candle that she lit.

And a Christian group, again Christian, okay? They are so important in my life. A Christian group in \u0152 in \u0152 in my area had set up a storefront and boarded it up and put on a Star of David , and c-call it Jude, and \u0152 and desecrated the front of a \u0152 of a storefront as a kind of a replica as to what we had endured during that time period. And I found that touching. And as my \u0152 my wife said, on the lampposts ar ound \u0152 around the park where we lived, there were signs as to what had transpired against Jews in that period. What I also found very interesting is that two blocks away from where we lived \u0152 and my parents never told me this, I \u0152 Albert Einstein lived. Okay? And there\u2122s a large \u0152 a large stone \u0152 I can\u2122t say a memorial, what do you \u0152 lar \u0152 large \u0152 a very, very large stone plaque that this was the residence of Albert Einstein. I said, my God, I never knew that I lived in such a \u0152 such a prestigious neighborhood. But \u0152 but \u0152 but ger \u0152 German \u0152 German citizens are much more aware \u0152 I \u0152 I think \u0152 my gut feeling tells me that the Holocaust will be \u0152 will be nothing other than a museum piece in years to come, that who knows whether even our Jewish grandchildren or their children will have knowledge of the Holocaust? I think it\u2122s going to \u0152 I think \u0152 I think it will disappear in time, and you will \u0152 you will stay around. When I say you, I\u2122m talking about the Holocaust Museum, and maybe a couple of other ones wi-will stay Interview with John Lang October 15, 2010 61around. But I \u0152 we\u2122ll se \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I see that in the next 10 years town, some of the Holocaust centers, unless they\u2122re well-endowed, will not make it. Because that generation that has supported them will no longer be there, and the next generation will not ha \u0152 will not step up to the plate.

And that\u2122s why I c \u0152 I get along with \u0152 wa \u0152 you know, I get along on a first name basis with the co nsul general, and with other Germans, I \u0152 I greet them. They are, as far as I\u2122m concerned, part of \u0152 part of my life, part of a new life. Lot of \u0152 lot of my generation cannot, have not, will not say what I\u2122ve just sa \u0152 told you. They will live in the past and say they will never forgive or forget. I can never forgive and forget, but I can move on.
