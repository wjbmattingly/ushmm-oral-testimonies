And my little sister, Nellie, I don\u2122t know what was wrong with her, I know she was very fragile at first, and of course, being the youngest, she was spoiled.

I didn\u2122t lik e chicken soup, so if I didn\u2122t eat it, she didn\u2122t want to eat it, and I was told that I would get it for both of us, because she did everything I did. I was a very finicky person, even in thos e days.

There was a small Jewish community, we were not active with it. We were turned down to go to services because we didn\u2122t have money. That was also a slap in the face.

My husband came out of the hospital, went into practice. I went to work for him, then he was hospitalized again for a very, very long time.

I was very, very concerned about my child, and I worked with a Social Worker, and then eventually with the child psychi -- my son wa s alright, but it was to help me cope, and to try to keep him as even as can be.

I saw the writing on the wall, I didn't know how long my husband would be ill, and I couldn\u2122t stay in the sewing industry, I worked for a small store, there were long layoffs, there were USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 49 short hours.

Was very nervous, was very self-conscious, and it was through the help of a Social Worker that gave me enough confidence to say -- you know, I was a foreign background, my accent was much heavier.

I never lost a day\u2122s pay. I learned to get on my feet, I learned to invest money, in a small way. And I ret -- And then, they had a new director who came, who was a complete opposite, Dr. Gambetti. P.

Their daughters came in from out of town, I went. And I was able to say, \ufb01Dr. Gambetti, I don\u2122t understand Italian.\ufb02 And I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 52 was able to close the door and say, \ufb01You have to hear me,\ufb02 because his mind was someplace else, and I was handling a lot, a lot of money on grants. And I retired from there just in time, before -- as the health industry is changing, there\u2122s no more Division of Neuropathology, as far as the hospital is concerned. I had hospital work, and bulk of my work was Case Western Reserve University, be cause of the research, and they eventually hired another secretary, she took my place as a matter of fact. And I ended up handling grants, and I kept screaming, \ufb01I trained to be a secretary, not a bookkeeper.\ufb02 Finally got the stuff on the computer, and it was dou ble work, because the computer did not communicate with the accounting department of Case Western Reserve University. So I was projecting on the computer, and multiplying, but then I still had statements every month. And I just didn\u2122t like my work any more, because I didn\u2122t do the manuscripts. You know, the word processors came out. I didn\u2122t read them over and over. Today they are all type, they are all manuscripts more or less, change them, you know, on the word processors. So it just wasn\u2122t the same and the set up with the administrators who are changing, and I got out just in time. I don\u2122t th ink I could have survived it. But I learned a lot, my mind was working and he gave me a party when I retired, Dr. Gambetti. No secretary had what I had. He -- Dr. Russman, the ass-associate director, had a daughter who was doing, on the side or second job, or whate -- she did cat ering on her own, and we went to the conference room in one of the -- in the Bowwell Center. And he gave me a going away party with beef tenderloin, wh ite wine, flowers, you name it. And I know what displeased me is I had to invite ever ybody in the -- in the Institute of Pathology, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 53 even the people I didn\u2122t care. I had to think of people from Case Western Reserve that I had a lot of contact, from the hospital. I thi nk I had about 100 - 110 people. And we had a storm that day. My girlfriend from Beria neve r made it, they were iced in. And they presented me with a gift certificate that just about covered a cruise, because I told -- I was so tired, I was trying to wind up everything, not to leave loose ends, be -- by the time I left, and it didn\u2122t work out. Everything changed afterwards, anyway. And that\u2122s the going away he gave me. I went shor tly after, with a tray of candy and was able to write a note, \ufb01I know it\u2122s because of you that I had this.\ufb02 Today they couldn\u2122t do it, because the money isn\u2122t there, but that\u2122s -- that\u2122s what I got as a going away for retiring. It was such a different environment than the sewing industry, especially in the small shops. I worked in -- in the sewing industry I worked with, at the time, many Polish immigr -- DP\u2122s actually, who had gone through anti-Sem itism, the camps. And when you sew, your mind is not occupied, so they would tr -- you know, they would talk about different things. And they -- I was raised whatever I do is good enough, and I was not afraid of anything. I mean, tar -- I was a shy girl and everything, I mean, ta lk about what was left, after that I just blossomed out until I wasn\u2122t afraid of anything, and I wasn\u2122t afraid to speak back. And it -- the store I worked in, it was the couple who owned it. He was low key, she was -- I don\u2122t know why these people were afraid of her, she used to come down and I don\u2122t know. The bookkeeper was an American born American, and she thought she was something better than anybody else."

So, when I left there, my biggest pleasure was, as I was going to school and working there, and I decided I had to give up the working, ya -- because I couldn\u2122t practice my typing. I did well in shorthand, but not in typing, and I just couldn\u2122t keep up. My husband was hospitalized out of town, and I was driving back and forth on th e weekend. And my biggest pl easure was when I went in and I was hired, through University Hospitals, I bought a used car, and I went in, because I had befriended -- her name is -- was Litta Ridman, she was 80 years old at the time. And I came in with the keys, and I said -- not knowing what I was walking into, I said, \ufb01I\u2122m secretary to the professor of neuropath ology at Western Reserve University,\ufb02 and was it Fran, the bookkeeper or was it the owner Mr. Philips, who say, \ufb01What\u2122s neuropathology?\ufb02 And as a foreigner, it made me feel so gra, because I don\u2122t know why, in the small stores, they just -- they try to -- to make you look down. And the head fitter was a German woman, Jewish woman, who kne w less than I did in alterations, I guess, for some reason or other, she had learned, an d really was -- at times she was alright. She had a husband who had MS or so mething. She had problems, but I just put my foot down, because I said, \ufb01She has problems, so do I.\ufb02 And I remember a couple times, I took a gown and I threw it at her, because I knew more than she did as far -- nobody could take away the sewing from me. Took me a hard ti me struggling to become a secretary because USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 55 I was confident in sewing, but not as a secretary. B-Yet after working there, it worked out all right. I mean, I was confident, I was comfortable, I was respected and I worked in an environment that, you know, the hospi -- it wasn\u2122t even the hospital, it really is pathology, neuropathol -- you know, you get cornered in one small division -- where I was respected, and there -- there -- there ca -- there th -- you had MD\u2122s , Ph.D.\u2122s, and very play -- you know, nobody put on the air, you were accepted, on -- on -- on -- on a same level. So I -- I worked myself out, and I started, quote, living. It\u2122s not a full life. My son went off to Kent, married. I have three beautiful granddaughters. One just graduated from high school. She is off to college in va -- in Virginia, she\u2122s off to college. Alicia just turned 18, Whitney will be 16 in September, and Erica, the little one, just was Bats Mitzvahed in May. And I hoped to go back and forth to Virginia, really. Besides, I\u2122ve been traveling on a trip, a big trip once a year. And it\u2122s hard to see my grandchildren grow up, because I look at them and think to myself, \ufb01Oh my God, that\u2122s the age I was that Germans walked in on that time.\ufb02 And things are surfacing, I guess, that maybe I pushed back, that I didn\u2122t want to face. I ha ve guilt feelings, when things are very, very bad for me. Not lately, so much. When I\u2122ve gone through difficult times, I have felt that I was being punished, that I deserved it, becaus e I didn\u2122t suffer the same as my family did. And it -- it just happens every so often, and I think what I\u2122m going to do now is try to call it quote, finalize. I\u2122m going to look into a tr ip to go [indecipherable] feeling -- and I know there\u2122s nothing there, to go to yadva -- to -- not to Yad Vashem, to Auschwitz, just to get it out of my system. And for many years, I tho ught, oh maybe my sister is floating around USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 56 someplace, and doesn\u2122t know wher e she is. And I think, as I get older, I realize how alone I am. I have no sisters, I have no nieces. My husband comes from a ra -- broken family, and I have no nieces and nephews. The fe -- cousins that I have -- I have one that I\u2122m pretty close with. But he\u2122s quite ill now, is -- as it is, their children live in the same area where my son lives, all three of them. But I have, as far as family, family, but I ha -- I have no close ties. But I have -- still have friends from -- I met when I came to the States. My girlfriend Esther, with whom I\u2122m very, very close, died many, many years ago, of breast cancer. Many years ago. And I have tw o of the -- the girls that I met from the sorority that I consider family. I go there -- I -- I\u2122m not i nvited, I\u2122m expected. But what happens, we\u2122re all getting older, so now th e children are doing the holidays and it so happen they\u2122re out of town. So, my life is changing a little bit, you know, as far as that\u2122s concerned. But they\u2122re -- they\u2122re two friends -- I have other ones too, that I can depend on, and I consider family, but you realize, I don\u2122t know why, it scares me sometimes, because I don\u2122t want to get depressed, I don\u2122t want to run into -- to the elderly lev -- you know, left alone or something like that. And -- And to feel, you know, I do -- I do get down, but everybody does at one time or other. I seem to overcome it, and I\u2122m very thankful for what I have, really. I\u2122m comfortable financially. I take one big trip, at least once a year. Went to the -- a national parts la -- parks last year with a friend. The year before, I was in France. I have plans to go to Iceland in September. I\u2122ve gone with Elder Hostel, and I go for short trips to an Elder Hostel with a friend, or I\u2122ve gone by myself. I went to Equador by myself, had a strange room mate, the same thing to France, and that\u2122s USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 57 about it, really. But the guilt -- the guilt -- the guilt is there, the guilt is. Although I don\u2122t face real hard times, like when my husband was ill, and things came up, and it\u2122s a terrible, terrible feeling. I used to also shudder when I used to hear the airplanes, when they had the propellers, but now they have th e jets. But I -- When the airplanes used to go, I just -- just absolutely shuddered, but now with the pr ope -- with the jets, you don\u2122t get it, so I -- I don\u2122t feel it any more. I don\u2122t quite have the nightmares I used to -- to have. I guess I\u2122m settling, I guess. Trying to enjoy my gra ndchildren. Not one of them belongs to me, they all take after the father\u2122s side of the family, their grandfather, and the middle one takes after her mother\u2122s side of th e family, because one is strawberry blonde, two redheads. And the eyes and the shapes, there isn\u2122t one that belongs to my side of the family, nothing\u2122s come out. But, make the best of it. So, I\u2122m not unhappy, it\u2122s maybe not a full life, but I\u2122m contented, make the best of it, you know."

And even when the girls have the Bats Mitzvah, he does bring up that my family perished in the Holocaust. It\u2122s interesting, because I was never very traditional. He was not Bar Mitzahed, but he became very close with the temple, and the -- the girls are very -- course, well, he became involved somehow or other, ev en though I never pushed it. And I did all this for my children, so lot of things surfaced when I did the interviews, and things.

They made the national news as a matter of fact, because they raised money for -- he had -- it was a ham operator and when he told me was president of Hillel, I almost flipped because, I mean, you know, so I guess even though I was not traditional in keeping the holidays, so to speak, and things like that, there\u2122s some Jewishness in him and the girls are -- went through Bats Mitzvah and everything like that, so something is projected on him.

            "answer": "No, no, y-you mean, the w -- to find work? I had no trouble finding work in alterations. That was wide open. There was no money in it, that\u2122s what made me leave. Bec -- I didn\u2122t go for the department stores for some reason or other. I went to the small shops, and sewing industry is predominantly Jewish, and I worked w ith, you know, a -- in -- in those days, DP\u2122s. I mean, today it\u2122s entirel y different. I left because first of all my mind -- your -- y-your mind is not occupied, so you talk, and you bring up things. I was having problems because my husband was ill at the time, and -- and y-you have too much time -- y-your mind is free. In other words, your hands are busy, but not your mind. And I needed a better income than doing alterations. As a matter of fact, I just bought something in one of the department stores, a nd I had a pair of pants shortened, because I don\u2122t have the -- the mach -- my machine is old and it doesn\u2122t have some of the stuff that I need. And I -- I don\u2122t sew any more, and I did talk to the -- the woman who fitted me. It\u2122s -- I asked her -- she\u2122s from Greece, I don\u2122t kn ow what her background is, and I let her USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 65 know that I was a fitter, cause the first one I had was terrible, was somebody new, new in the country and I knew she was not a fitter. And I asked for a real fitter. Anyway, she came and she said she was from Greece, and I let her know the training, and you know, my background. And I said I luckily left it, because they didn\u2122t pay. And she did tell me that it pays much better. I says, but not as well, probably, as the tailors, because the tailors supported the families, even if they did alteration, and she said yes, it was on the same par. So I guess things have changed. I don\u2122t know which -- at which point in life, but at the time -- at the time I did alterations, I even -- I did well. The dress shop where I had worked before I went to school, I -- they were paying a dollar and a quarter an hour, I got a dollar and a half. I ti -- he asked me to come and help. And I went -- A friend of mine, who was a secretary says, \ufb01Frida,\ufb02 she says --I was very nervous, very self-conscious about becoming a secretary, I -- my foreign background, a nd this and that. And she said, \ufb01Go on temporaries, that\u2122s a good way to start.\ufb02 And I got a job for one day at -- at a TV station. And I remember -- What did I make? In -- th -- Mr. Philips called me back. Oh, and I said, \ufb01Unless you pay me two dollars an,\ufb02 -- oh yeah, they were paying me two dollars an hour, temporary. I didn\u2122t kno w -- I didn\u2122t do anything, I di -- and he -- he never -- he never took me, so -- and there were long layoff seasons. They weren\u2122t fair in the way they were laying off people. M -- Talking small store, and if I was five minutes late, I lost the five minutes. And I went to work for University Hospitals, for some reason or other, I don\u2122t remember what I paid for bread yesterday, but I -- that was two dollars an hour, even at 40 hours, which I didn\u2122t put in, it would have been 80 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 66 dollars, and I was --what did I earn? Oh, wait a minute. I want -- I wa -- I was earning so much more it was unbelievable. I mean, there\u2122s no comparison, and like I say, and a -- I retired with a pension, which I -- I don\u2122t know if the stores do it, and the small stores are slowly disappearing. They can\u2122t survive with all the -- all th is -- chain stores, so that\u2122s what made me leave, I knew I had to support myself in a different way and I said, I don\u2122t care what I do, I never, never want to face what I faced when my son was seven year old, where I did not have money to go buy food to feed him. And it never happened again, so I -- I -- I had illnesses, I had surgeries, I never lost a day\u2122s work which wouldn\u2122t have happened in those days in the sewing industry. And the factories, th-the sewing factories, the garment far -- factory had slowly, over the years, moved south for -- for lower wages, and now, of course, they come from oversea s, so I had to get out of -- of that environment. And whether the department stores pay better, I don\u2122t know. Sometimes I think I should wan -- go back for a little bit part time, just to learn to deal with the new fabrics, and the new things. I still -- I still, I think, have a touch for it. I went through a period where I sewed all my clothes, I\u2122m very had to fit. But you can\u2122t get the fabrics in Cleveland any more. There\u2122s one fabric shop le ft, but you da -- can\u2122t get the fine wools, and the silks, and the -- I can\u2122t even knit, because there are no knit shops. I can\u2122t get the yarns, or anything like that. That \u2122s what I miss. But I have no regret that I went to -- to where -- to what I did, the environment was entirely different."

He was in school, he had two mo -- it was supposed to be one year, a nd the year he was there, he -- they extended the class to two years. And graduated, and he went into podiatry. But in those days they were called chiropodists, and they didn\u2122t have -- they were very limited on what they could do, you know. No surgery, they couldn \u2122t even prescribe an aspirin or anything like that. And we moved to Sandusky and then just -- no matter how hard he tried it, it never -- it never took off. That\u2122s why we came back to Cleveland. His illness, and then whatever. And then I couldn\u2122t go to work in Sandusky because I was marri ed to a doctor and I didn\u2122t have a profession. And it was through somebody I had befriended there, that she USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 68 suggested I do alterations at home, and I sa ys, \ufb01Wait a minute, I don\u2122t do alterations, I\u2122m a dressma -- I know how to make a garment, but I don\u2122t know alternations.\ufb02 And it was through her -- I would make hems and things like that, and I made a little bit of money on the side. And that\u2122s how I went into alterations when I came back to Cleveland, because I tried the sewing factory, but the sewing industry was not the same, I couldn\u2122t earn money or -- or anything like that. And I couldn\u2122t ear-earn enough to support my son. And eventually, the Social Security laws came out, so I was able to earn, and I got Social Secur -- just as I got my job at University Hospitals, I got Social Security for him and for my son, until he reached, you know, age where they didn\u2122t give it. So that helped me, because I couldn\u2122t -- I couldn\u2122t survive on what I was making. I was a -- making 80 -- 80 something dollar -- 80 -- was it 86 dollars a we ek, or something. 87.50, now I remember, a week. As opposed to a dollar and a quarter, or a dollar and a half an hour. And then I had benefits. I had sick days. And when -- I used to get sick every three weeks, not every month, I needed a day off. I was, you know, in bed. So, a-all together, it worked out very nicely. And it was a different environment. I never thought of going into an intellectual background, but it was marvelous. I mean, it was very enlightening. We had what they call now Research Associate they call them. People who came from different countries for two years, to do research. So you had a very diversified background, and it was very - it was very good, it was very enlightening, it was not backbreaking, you know. If I had stayed in the sewing industry, I\u2122m pretty sure I wouldn\u2122t be even living here, even though it\u2122s not high rent or anything. I would -- I w ould be on subsidi -- I wo uld have to be in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 69 subsidized apartments.

I knew, even with the -- with the slavery, but didn\u2122t understand the full extent of it, until I lived with it and was exposed to it. And when I would go someplace and fill out a -- when I went to Lampole, which is -- was a sewing factory, one of the big ones in Cleveland, and I was shocked that they ask what my nationality was. And when I told -- I don\u2122t remember who I told, my family, somebody, I said, \ufb01I marked Czechoslovakia. \ufb02 And they said, \ufb01You should have said USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 70 Jewish.\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Jewish is a religion, it\u2122s not a nationality.\ufb02 I had to argue wh-why are people so conscious of what religion somebody is. I will discuss the differences if I have a-an -- an intelligent conversation. I worked w ith an Indian girl, you know, from India. I worked with a Black -- what they call a-an African American girl, and that was the beginning of -- where the -- the Blacks were, you know, being absorbed, and things like that, and talk openly -- I will talk about it. But, people will say to me about somebody, \ufb01Are they ja -- is he, or is she Jewish?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01It never entered my mind to ask.\ufb02 Because I take a person the way they are an-an-and I -- and I don\u2122t think what are they. I couldn\u2122t understand, also, why they went into ethnic backgrounds, but I\u2122m learning, I\u2122m learning. It\u2122s interesting to find what is their background, you know, where their parents came from, because those are cultures. That I can understand. We\u2122ll discuss the -- I -- I would like to take a class in comparative religion, because I don\u2122t know anything about the Islamic religion, and I think it\u2122s very interesting, they all have their points. And that is something that really amazed me, w -- and at the time, I did not understand what\u2122s the difference what my nationality is, but now I understand. It\u2122s just -- I just took a class on immigration, through the elder campus at Tri-C, and the professor was very, very interesting. He happened to be Slov-Slov enian? Yeah. And he had taught at Case Western Reserve and everything. And we reached a point about the bilingual, the Spanish. And I told him he opened my eyes. I always felt, wait a minute, I spoke French, nobody bothered to have things translated in French, explain -- I had to learn English. Everybody who came had to learn English. And he pointed out to -- to us that Spanish, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 71 you take Mexico, Texas, they were the Spanish people, and the British were stronger, so the -- the English wa -- language prevailed, and everything Anglic an took over. And I looked at him, and I says -- he said, \ufb01Oh, they didn\u2122t emigrate. They were forced into becoming part of the -- you know, of ameri -- part of the United States, and the English language was dumped into them, but that\u2122s ta king away what is right for them.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Okay, now I understand, now I\u2122m willing to accept that it should be, if necessary, bilingual.\ufb02 First of all, it wouldn\u2122t hurt, but you think, \ufb01Wait a minute, I barely spoke any English, I had to learn English.\ufb02 But I can see their point, and I knew that the streets were not paved with gold, that much I knew. Ho w hard it was to work, I don\u2122t know, I was never made to [indecipherable ] work, the factory flabbergasted me, because there were rows of machines, and it was piecework, and I was used to ha ve one garment at the time, hand finished. I remember going with my girlfriend Elaine shopping for clothes and what I used to do is turn everything inside out to see if it was finished. And she didn\u2122t want to go shopping, because even in those days, everything, you know, was -- was unfinished on the inside. And I learned to -- to do piecework. And then you had the oil that went around constantly around the machine. They also had -- They didn\u2122t have a lunchroom, per se, they had a room where you brought your lunch, and -- and you ate in that back room. But you have to realize in the sewing factories, in the summertime, you worked on winter clothes. Wool, the lint. And we always changed clothes. I had what they call wrap around, they don\u2122t see them any more. And I was just flabbergasted that that were the circumstances. I wanted to take up dressm aking and dress designing again, and the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 72 foreman, Mr. Harris, I remember his name, sa id to me, \ufb01Frida, don\u2122t waste your time in Cleveland, you have to go to New York.\ufb02 And then I met my husband and I got married, so I never went through w ith it. But I had learned through somebody about Prinz beeterman. They made suits and coats, and th ey made a better garment. Some things were still finished by hand. And I had put an application in and I think I had put an application for hand sewing for some reason or other, and they never called me. And somebody -- I ran into somebody who said they were hired. So I re-contacted Prinz beeterman, and I went to work there where the conditions were much, much better. I made a lot more money by the hour. I was making a dollar someth ing at Prinz beeterman, I went -- I mean at Lampoles. Went to Prinz beeterman, and I went up as high as three dollars something an hour piecework. And we had a lunchroom and everything. So the -- the environment was entirely -- entirely different. It was whiter, it was cleaner. And you have to realize, you worked in the sewing factory, sometimes it reached a hundred degrees in the work room. I think one of the -- it was a si -- a knit factory, I can\u2122t think of the name, they were not far from where we were on Euclid, and they moved in the suburbs, and they had air conditioning, but we didn\u2122t. And then I was told at -- how bad it was -- I don\u2122t know what years it was, where they had the fire in New York, in the garment factories, because of the condition and they didn\u2122t care about their people. So these are the things that -- I think that awed me that -- I don\u2122t know. And then I used to th ink, oh, I reached a point in my life I used to think, wonder what my life would have been if I would have stayed in Belgium? I don\u2122t think I would have struggled as hard as I did after I came to the States. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 73 The hardest part, financially, was when my husband was ill and hospitalized, first for six months, then he was all right for three years, went back into practice. I worked for him. An -- B-But the first time with no money -- I mean, no money. Two months behind in the rent, utilities, you name it. And I had no one to turn to. I must say that the small Jewish community in Sandusky rallied, and somebody cam e to my -- to the house and ask me if I needed anything. As it is, I didn\u2122t need it, because my husband\u2122s brother gave us 500 dollars, we -- which helped me overcome the worst of it, and then I sold the house. I didn\u2122t make any money on it, but I salvaged some money and moved to Cleveland, which a -- I figured, I wonder -- the rent was 90 - 96 dollars, and then they raised it 10 dollars. And I figured, as long as the money lasts, I\u2122ll stay there. And it turned out all right. My husband came out of the hospital, went into practice and we got on our feet, quote, financially, and managed to survive. And then -- I wasn\u2122t wealthy, but I was -- I had my head above water. And my concern was always, I left an eight year old child at home alone while I went to work. He had no way of reaching me at the factory. And luckily, it was through some friends who lived in the same complex, that I knew they kept an eye on Mark. Like, he came home for lunch, and I would prepare his lunch, and I had a little TV tray -- table so he could have it, and ye ars, years later, I -- some people would made comment because he went to Kent State University, and when he\u2122d come home, I would have a glass of milk, and I would have a sa ndwich wrapped, and pe ople used to make comments about it, and I said, \ufb01You didn\u2122t have what I had, where I had to leave a child to come home to an empty house.\ufb02 I hate wh en -- I -- I like when people have comments, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 74 and my daughter-in-law teased for the long est time, because Mark was terrible in the morning, I couldn\u2122t get him out of bed. And th e only way I could get him to sit up wa -- I used to squeeze fresh orange juice, and I would go and say, \ufb01Mark,\ufb02 and I would hand him a glass of orange juice. And that got -- that got him sitting up in bed. But the -- the financial difficulties were really, really bad. I don\u2122t think I thought of that time of even going back or anything. I also -- There were some hard feeling that I n -- that I never, never cleared my mind, is my father adored children. He never came to see his grandson. I did want to go back, and they offered me the fare for a boat or something, but I never told my father that I didn\u2122t have any mone y and how badly I was struggling financially. When I went back a year after he died, my uncle -- my father\u2122s brother Josef was still living, and she said, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t you ever tell your father?\ufb02 And I guess I had too much pride. I never told him, I never -- and I understand he died, he had established his business. My father died a well-to-do man, but I never -- I never asked for anything.

            "answer": "No, I didn\u2122t. It was a Friday, early in the morning, we lived in Sandusky, and I got a phone call, it was the telegram office. Didn\u2122t speak French. My uncle was sending me a telegram, and they said in French, \ufb01Ton pere decee,\ufb02 and that\u2122s when I screamed, because USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 75 they were saying my father was deceased, and I screamed, and my husband came to the phone. I had no money, I had no passport, and I never went, I never saw him again, never. And I went back a year later. And I we nt -- I saw his widow. I found out that my father was very unhappily married. He had imported a woman from Czechoslovakia. You know, must say this, when I came to the States, the Americans thought Europeans were not discriminating because, well, we had a couple African from Belgium Congo, but you didn\u2122t have the discrimination against the Black population, like here. But you wonder why there is a war going on in Yugoslavia? My father wouldn\u2122t have touched a Polish woman. The -- The Czechs didn\u2122t like the Polish, the -- the Polish didn\u2122t like the Lithuanian, I mean the -- i-i-it\u2122s th-the ethni c background, it\u2122s amazing, it does exist. And she told me he never wa -- came. He walked around with my mother\u2122s pictures and my sister\u2122s pictures. And I went in to see her because my father had a ring from my mother, and I wanted it. And I thought, if she\u2122s wear ing it, I was going to take it. She wasn\u2122t wearing it. And they had a couple things that were salvaged from -- I guess when my mother was taken away. I don\u2122t even know who stored them, neve r found out, never asked. And I guess everything came, and I took the train back to Brussels because my Uncle Josef had moved to Brussels, and the on ly family I had was in Brussels. But I had gone to Li\u00e8ge because my father, very shortly, maybe two weeks before he died, had made out a will leaving everything to his wife. And I found out that in Belgium you cannot disinherit a child. S -- Thr-Through a school friend in Li\u00e8ge, I -- with whom I was still corresponding, she got me a lawyer. I got a few dollars, not much. I did go back to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 76 Belgium, but I had to go to Brussels, because my uncle was there, but the lawyer was in Li\u00e8ge. And of course, I walked in on my father\u2122s widow, and she did not know I was coming. And I guess walking and seeing just a -- a couple personal belongings -- she did give me the linens my mother had made by hand, I still have them, as her trousseau when she was a young girl. And I\u2122ll never forget I went back to Belgium and it was dusk, and I was sitting in the living room, and I was crying. And my aunt came in, and she says, \ufb01What are you crying like an imbecile?\ufb02 And I just could not -- I could not relate to her. She\u2122s -- I don\u2122t know, she raves about her -- she\u2122s crazy about her son, her daughter, I don\u2122t know. And th -- She doesn\u2122t have the warmth. And she went through -- after they started picking up the Jews, they ended up in southern France. They did have a hard time, they didn\u2122t go out to camps, because -- I remember they said in one camp they deported the Hungarians, so they said they were Czech, and then the other camp they said deported the Czech, so they said they were Hungarian. So they managed to survive. They had two children. And I don\u2122t know what kind of camps they were, because I never asked. Her -- My aunt\u2122s family, she had a mother, a father, two sisters and a brother. When the Germans invaded Belgium, they got on a train -- see, we tried to go to -- to France, we didn\u2122t know they were going to invade France, her family got on a train, and the whole family was killed from the bombi ng, from the Germans. But yet, when I fell apart at the seams and came back to Brussels, and I was crying. I just couldn\u2122t -- I couldn\u2122t explain to her, I was exposed to -- t-t-to -- to -- to my wa r years, to -- to -- to -- you know, living in the States, I put everything in the back. I -- I -- I guess maybe I did it intentionally, I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 77 didn\u2122t think of those things. You push somethi ng out of your way, push things out of your mind, didn\u2122t face what really happened in the camps. And here I was, and I went back and all this faced me, and everything surfaced, and she just couldn\u2122t -- I don\u2122t think she could appreciate it. So that\u2122s the hard time I went through. And I did tell her -- she wanted to know why I didn\u2122t come as soon as my father died, because we had a business, and his widow emptied th-th-the stocks and th ings, so she didn\u2122t pay the taxes the way it should, and I -- who even thought of it? As difficult a time as I had with my father after the war, he was a fantastic father as children. During the war he -- he -- we -- we had everything. My father did Black Market. We ne ver went hungry. He -- When he used to -- to go to the farmers and bring eggs and butter and salt on his bicycle, and -- and sell it. We never -- We never went hungry. So, what happened after, was the effect of whatever happened to him that maybe didn\u2122t appreciate at the time. Now that I have th -- what I know is guilt feelings, because you survived, I think maybe he had guilt feelings of having survived untouched. Maybe it would have been different if he had gone out to the camps and survived, I don\u2122t know. But as I matured and got older and faced the truth what happened, maybe he had guilt feelings. I don\u2122t know, he never talked about it. And then, when my Uncle Gesa came, and I used to visit him quite often, I used to go to Denver about twice a year. Went with Mark, then went by myself. After surgery I went there. And I used to say to him, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t he come to the States to see his grandchild?\ufb02 And he just raised his shoulders and neve r answered, so I don\u2122t know -- I don\u2122t know why he came. As a matter of fact, my cousin Miriam told me in Paris that he was very USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 78 good to her. He was very good to her, and what happened, I don\u2122t know. As children, I mean, we were provided for, we had caring pa rents. I don\u2122t wish a ny more on any other child. Financially, we didn\u2122t have much. I di dn\u2122t know what a doll was, I don\u2122t think they ever bought me a doll. I think the dolls I got was from the schools. The schools, at Christmastime used to give -- I remember I ha d a doll. You have to remember they were the breakable dolls. And I remember I put it on the window sill, and there were some lu -- leftovers from the sewing my mother did, and the thing pushed the doll away and the doll broke, but they never replaced it. Bicycles we had, because we needed it for transportation. And after my accident -- I had an accident before we went into hiding. I went out to the country with my sister Bert a and another friend, and I don\u2122t know what happened, we went ou -- I remember going uphill, and we had to walk and it was a hot day, and I wanted to sit down, and I -- I can\u2122t pl ace it this time if my sister said it, or the other girl said it, they say, \ufb01Oh, Frida, now the hill goes down.\ufb02 And I got on the bicycle, and I remember as if yesterday -- I don\u2122t reme mber if it\u2122s my sister or the other girl, yelled, \ufb01Frida, you\u2122re losing your pedals.\ufb02 I fainted and I went down the hill in a fainted state. I guess th-the power of rolling down. A nd I went into -- I don\u2122t know if it was -- it was a building, I don\u2122t know if it was a castle. And it was somebody of aristocracy, and they brought me back with their chauffeurs, to the house. And I remember they gave my mother smelling salts, because one side of my face was damaged, and I must have had a slight brain concussion, because if somebody moved a chair or something, I couldn\u2122t take the noise. And my mother didn\u2122t wanted me to ride a bicycle. My father went -- somehow USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 79 or other found a second hand bicycle, so, you know, things were not produced, and I got another bicycle. So I had that accident, and then I had an accident three days before my birthday, my 17 th birthday. But whatever could be pr ovided for us, schooling, we had private tutors to help us more, but not the arts, or music or anything. First of all, I was not interested. Berta was, but I guess they felt that it was not important, so we didn\u2122t have it. I remember going to an opera with a neighbor. I went to see Faust. But they did not participate in the arts in any way. I never questioned it, never knew."

And then, let\u2122s see, did I go back again? No, I was out, I never went back. I have no desire to go back. I know Miriam said to me, \ufb01Why don\u2122t you go work for the common market. You\u2122re bilingual.\ufb02 By then I was losing my Fre -- when I say losing my French, I excelled in French, but to speak two languages, and translate, are two different things. You need a training and a background, and I have to stop and think, \ufb01How do you say USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 82 that in French?\ufb02 I finally met some people, quite by -- was just a freak, I took the Rapid to go downtown and this woman sat next to me and she had a little brochure, and I says, \ufb01Oh, I didn\u2122t know the Americans were in terested in Moliere.\ufb02 And she happens -- I don\u2122t know where she learned French, but she introduced me to a group, and they\u2122re strictly women, we get -- they get together twice a month, at Beechwood Place, and from 10 to 12, and then on Friday they get toge ther at somebody\u2122s home, and everybody brings something, just for the purpose of speaking French. So I\u2122ve gotten back into speaking French, and it\u2122s not a word of English, until you turn to so mebody who just came back from France, who has close contact, and you say, \ufb01How do you say such and such in French?\ufb02 Nobody could remember how to say fl ush a toilet in French. And I read French books. I go down to the library about once a month. Cleveland library downtown, the main library is magnificent. I have -- going to go down next week, I think, because they built a new building, and they re-did the old building, which was closed, and I got to know -- they had a -- the foreign literature library, and she just sent me a book. She knows the authors I like, or if she sees a book on Belgium, she\u2122ll send it to me. One of them she sent me was all about the percentages of Catholic -- Cath -- Catholicism.

But they\u2122re long distance, you know, so it doesn\u2122t make any differe nce. As a matter of -- th -- Alicia called me, she said, \ufb01I have to take a language, I don\u2122t know what to take, maybe German.\ufb02 And I didn\u2122t want to tell her don\u2122t. I did say, \ufb01Oh, [indecipherable] you don\u2122t USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 83 want German.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01[indecipherable] to take French,\ufb02 I said, \ufb01but take Spanish, it\u2122s much more useful, you know, in the States.\ufb02 So I don\u2122t know what she\u2122s going -- she\u2122s going to do what she wants to do. She said something about taking Japanese, but she\u2122s not going into something where it would be required, so I don\u2122t know. But I do speak French. I have very little opportunity to speak Yiddish, and I trip on my words, bring in the English words, because the older generation is dying away, so the young people -- I\u2122m sure my little sister probably didn\u2122t even speak Yiddish, probably understood it, but the young generations don\u2122t speak Yiddish. We have a lot of Russian emigrants, but the Russians are like the Germans, they don\u2122t speak Yiddish. Best of all, they couldn\u2122t. Every so often I find them, and I\u2122ll say, \ufb01Do you speak Yiddish?\ufb02 So I can communicate with them. And maybe I\u2122ll break down -- I think Workman\u2122s Circle has classes in Yiddish. Maybe I should go back to it, maybe it\u2122ll come back. I just remember a couple letters of the alphabet. Don\u2122t know what go od it is, but I did read articles that in Israel they\u2122re te -- teaching Yiddish. In my generation they al ways said, \ufb01A Jew can go anywhere, he\u2122s never lost, as long as he speaks Yiddish.\ufb02 But it\u2122s not true any more. In my generation, when I was young, yes. It did come in handy. I went to Israel twice, the first time on my own. I was going to take a tour, and some re ason or other, I remember my cousin, the one who was in Belgium, as a soldier, I remember his address. They were pioneers on a kibbutz. And I wrote to him, and I said, \ufb01I want to come to Israel, I want to take a tour, but I\u2122d like to see you again and meet your fa mily.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Don\u2122t take a tour, come to the kibbutz.\ufb02 So I went on my own to the kibbutz, I arrived on a Friday, before USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 84 sundown, and on Saturday, my mother\u2122s side of the family came. My mother had a niece in Belgium and she went to Israel. And through the family I got her sister\u2122s address and they all invited me, which I didn\u2122t accept, but they grabbed me off, and I was taken to -- to visit Israel. I took one tour, that was it. Everybody else took me around, and then I went on the kibbutz and lived on the kibbutz, and got a taste, if you can, on a couple days at the kibbutz. Then I went back a number of years later -- oh, that time I traveled by bus everywhere. It was marvelous, because you meet more people, you learn more. And I took a bus back from ji -- di -- from Jerusalem to the kibbut z, and they dropped me off into the kibbutz, and my uncle had shown -- my cousin had shown me, \ufb01See Frida, this is the street I live on.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Sfee, you want me to remember? It\u2122s in Hebrew.\ufb02 So when I got off on the kibbutz, there was a man with a bicycle and he was a-a-an older man, and I looked at him, and I took a chance , and he was one of the Europeans from that generation, who had gone to Israel, and I was ab le to speak with him in Yiddish. So he took me to my cousin\u2122s house. The sec ond time I went, I went as a volunteer for the army. I didn\u2122t like the experience, and the thing that saved me is every weekend we were off, so I went to the different -- to the various members of the family. I didn\u2122t tour as -- that much, this time."

They treated me -- I mean, they didn\u2122t know what to do with me. If I had a -- a -- you know, they have the main meals in - in -- in the common dining room, but Ahoud and Ruth came, and sh e served some soup, and she used to bake. If I as much as picked up the cup to put it to the sink, she would slap my hands, she wouldn\u2122t let me do anything. She was so glad that I was in touch -- in touch with them, and that\u2122s the only contac t I have. And Miriam I don\u2122t hear from. She was in the States on business, and she was in New York, but she didn\u2122t tell me until the last minute, so I couldn\u2122t go to New York, and I did get a letter from her mother, saying she was due to come to the States, I don\u2122t know if it was Chicago or what, and I had told her, I says, \ufb01Miriam, if you let me know ahead of time, then I\u2122ll come, I\u2122ll stay in a hotel and I\u2122ll spend time with you.\ufb02 Well, I don\u2122t kn ow if she didn\u2122t come, she didn\u2122t contact me. She did contact me when she was in Ne w York. And I had it to -- a hard ta -- she kept changing hotels, so I had a hard time tr acking her. My aunt came to the States one time, many years ago, when my son lived in Connecticut, and he and his wife went to New York, they drove and met her, because she went to visit somebody from Belgium, and the woman spoke English, and I guess Fren ch, and she was a translator. And then she came -- it was interesting, she came a second time, but she didn\u2122t tell me until the last minute. She went to Florida, to somebody. And I say, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t you tell me? I was going to Florida once a year to visit friends.\ufb02 But I never saw her. It was too late, and I wasn\u2122t going to pay the high fare of the last minute fares to go to -- to -- to flori -- she USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0049 92 was in Miami and I was going to Fort Lauderda le. So I have no contact with any of them. I had a cousin in Los Angeles, I vi -- my aunt, the one from Denver\u2122s daughter, lived in Los Angeles, I spend time with her. I have a cousin too, that I met after the war, who lived in eng -- in Cleveland, went to Los Angeles, and I do have contact with one of the cousins in Canada. But otherwise -- and one of them here in -- two of them, I -- actually I somehow or other re-made contact with Lana\u2122s daughter, to a certain extent. Louie died many years ago, with a -- of a brain tumor, so -- but from my father\u2122s generation, from -- you know, from -- there\u2122s a -- Sfee\u2122s the only one in Israel from that generation, really. There is no one else left, no one else. And on my mother\u2122s side -- on my father\u2122s side, that generation, everyone was gone. On my mother\u2122s side -- oh no, wait a minute, on my mother\u2122s side, one uncle had remained, their two girls and my cousin Paul in Cleveland. And I understand he was one of the oldest survivors of the camp, and he stayed in Czechoslovakia, Romania, every time there\u2122s a war, and every time they divide the country, it becomes another country. I wa s Russian after World War Two, now it\u2122s Ukraine. And he eventually came to the States, but his mind was not -- he was in his 70\u2122s, he had gone through World War Two, he was in a nursing home."

Oh, Whitney was acting in some plays, and I went because she had a play, but it\u2122s not -- it\u2122s not as often as I would have liked. But all that is gone, so have to take it from here."
