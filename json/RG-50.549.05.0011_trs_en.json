We are doing an interview that will focus mostly on Mr. Haber\u2019s experiences after the Holocaust because he has been interviewed before by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation. And there is a videotape that is available through the Shoah Foundation. My name is Arwen Donahue and this is tape number one, side A. Mr. Haber, let\u2019s start with your date of birth.",

            "question": "And you talked about, in your other interview and by the way if we ever repeat anything, we\u2019 ll try to just cover things that we haven\u2019t talked about before. But I\u2019m sure that you don\u2019t remember everything that you said and didn\u2019t say, so I might remind you sometimes if we\u2019ve already talked about something. But in your other interview you did mention that you went, you had an unusual opportunity, you were growing up in a small town, in a shtetl and you were one of nine children, and you had an unusual opportunity to attend a high school, a public high school and eventually became a dentist. And I\u2019m wondering how it happened that you had this opportunity to study in a public high school and where the high school was?",
            "answer": "The high school was in Debica, which is in the district of Krakow and that was about nine kilometers of my village where I was born. And we had, from the age of three, in our house, always a teacher, special for religious purposes. But by this same occasion we were studying normal classes. So in the age of four I could already go in the village to the first class of public school and I still was a good pupil, because no one of them was on the level I was. But I finished there the fourth year and my father decided I have to go into the small city, which was Debica there. In the same time, he put us in a quarter, that means to live in the house of a Rabbi, which was teaching us the Hebrew and the religious teachings. In the same time I went to the Polish public school. And that was a very difficult experience because we have to get up in the morning at six o\u2019clock, sometimes earlier, and before we went to the public school in the morning for eight o\u2019clock it started, we had already to pray and to learn Hebrew and to learn everything about religious life. And more and more. So, I was there about six years living with this Rabbi. At the same time after I graduated from the normal school, from the seven classes, I applied to the high school, but I was too young. Because it was already that you can go to school, start school only by the age of seven, and I was four years old. But I was somehow fortunate, my father knew the director of this high school. And he spoke with him and he said, \u201cWell I cannot do it. He has to go normal now to the sixth class at least, at least and to repeat.\u201d And my father said, \u201cYou know, make him a test.\u201d\u201d And I got a test and I passed the test, but still 1 he couldn\u2019t take me. I had to repeat the seventh grade another year. And then I was accepted to the high school. And there I matriculated there and so I continued my studies."

            "question": "So, what language did you speak at home?",
            "answer": "Well, the first language we spoke, that was Yiddish. My father was very religious and he want us to know the Yiddish, we are spoken. But we had Polish Gentile servants, too, so we have to speak Polish too. And surrounded by peasants who are speaking Polish and you have to knew the language. In the school was Polish of course. When I went to school in Debica there was in the fourth class was already German, too. So I had German, Polish and Yiddish, and of course, Hebrew, which was, it was the liturgical language, to pray. At the age of three we started already to learn Hebrew and we knew the Hebrew alphabet and we knew to pray and most of the prayings until today, I know by heart. Most of the thick books, we learn, we have to do it. And the first when you opened eyes at the religious house, the first is to wash your hands, that\u2019s the first things. And to make a blessing about the washing the hands and you make a blessing for the food and you have to thank God that you got up in the morning. That was the first Hebrew praying and that was at the age of three. At the age of four we started already to learn the Torah, which is the Bible, the Old Testament. And so we continued to, so therefore I am quite acquainted about religious Jewish life. And then later on, of course, in high school we learned about, in the public school we learned about history and that was very interesting, world history, too. And German literature. And therefore I, until today, I am quite acquainted with the world literature and especially the German literature and the Hebrew, of course. And the Yiddish. So, this is the way like it was. It was a very hard thing, because the distance to the town was like I said about nine kilometers, eight or nine kilometers. I don\u2019t remember exactly. And for Saturday we used to go home, I mean to the village. And when we came to the village Saturday, there was the traditional Friday evening meal with the praying, with everything. In our house was there a minyan, which is the quorum of ten people which is praying, Jews, by Jewish law. And my late father, by himself with his own funds, he founded a Torah. He let scribe it, and we had a new Torah in our house and there was a praying in our house and my father was the master of the ceremony. And the people from the villages around, which were few, not always was there the quorum of ten people. But Saturday morning was always a praying in quorum. If it wasn\u2019t quorum, so how many it was, but it was the normal pray. And we had to know it and to participate. And that was in afternoon, my father take a sleep one hour and he took us 1n the room, me and my brother, because my older brother was with me in the school at this Rabbi. He was sitting down and we had to repeat what we learned all the week. My father wanted to know what we learned and how far we are continuing to progress. And that was the way like it was in our house. Of course, Saturday was like in the Torah is resting day. And that was the religious way of life. Nothing was working, nobody was working, even the servants. Only to feed the animals, to milk the cows and that what was doing. But not working in the field, not other work was performed. Only the most necessary for surviving, which was necessary."

            "question": "You mentioned that one of the towns nearby, Ropczyce, had a strong Hasidic tradition. Did your family have any Hasidic ties or traditions?",
            "answer": "My father by himself was a Hasid. But he didn\u2019t go to Ropcezyce because the old Ropcezyce Rabbi wasn\u2019t more. The founder of the Hasidic movement which was Reb Nafthali, which you 2 know. And he was no more alive. There was already third or fourth generation there and there was no potential Rabbi which could, which could affinate (ph) my father there. My father used to go to Sans (ph) , which was quite a distance, about fifty miles. To go for holidays there to the Rabbi of Sans (ph). Also sometimes OfBobof (ph), which is also a little shtetl there in the surroundings of Sans (ph). They were the very famous Rabbis, which is the continuation of this Rabbis is now here in the United States. They are siblings and family offsprings, which are continue this Hasidic movement of Bobof (ph) and of Sans (ph). And that was, my father was a Hasid of them. He wasn\u2019t, by himself, he wasn\u2019t a blind Hasidic. He wasn\u2019t overdoing. But the basic religious things were holy for him. And that was my father. Of course my mother did everything what my father said to do. The thing was, my father, his first wife passed away. And from his first wife, gave birth a daughter and by the birth she passed away. He was a young widower. He was already thirty-five or thirty-six years old and a matchmaker found him a girl of sixteen years somewhere in another village there. And she came to live with him, and she was my mother. She gave birth to the nine children. And we were in touch with our sister, because Jewish law recognize it, one child, when it is from the same father, is a sibling, more even than one mother. That is the religious way and tradition. Interesting enough, our sister, she married a very interesting man, who was, in the beginning he was a teacher in our house, teaching us the religious ways. He was very educated in Jewish Talmudic teachings. And he married her, and he succeeded, he became quite a rich man. And she gave birth to eight children. And there are only two children survived and they are still living. One is ninety-two years old, lives in the United States. And the other one is eighty-five years, that\u2019s the youngest one, eighty-four years old, lives in Israel."

            "question": "They would be your nieces and your nephews?",
            "answer": "Yeah, they are my nieces and we are in touch with them and we are very much in good relations. And very interesting story about these two nieces. Both of them survived the Holocaust. The one married in the war and had a daughter in the war. And she escaped, run away, being pregnant from Debica, I mean this village there, to Lvov, which was in the Ukraine. Then it was belonged to Poland, but the Russian invaded this part of the country, of Polish country. And she, when she saw the disaster in the ghetto, she put her child under a convent\u2019s door. And was looking from far away what happened to this child. And she saw that a nun came out and she took in the child in the house. And then she ran away and she became a servant, as a Polish girl, as a Gentile at the head of the Gestapo in Lvov. That was the older one. The younger one had a friend in Lvov. She was in Lvov studying sewing, to be a seamstering. Mother, very good seamster, which she was. And she met there a boy, before the war he was leader already of the trade unions. And when the Russian came in... in the beginning he was a very big shot. But when the Russians, when the German invaded, he went with the Russian back to Russia and there he joined the Polish Army, which was organized there by the Poles after their agreement, the Polish agreement in exile with the Russians, which allowed them to organize their Army, which was affiliated to the Russian Army. And they were fighting. And he was fighting the Germans until Berlin. And he put her on a Polish family. She was a seamster and she gave birth 3 to a daughter, but that was already in 1945 when the war is going to end. When he came from Russia to Poland with the invasion, I mean to fight with the Russian Army. And then she gave birth to this daughter. And when the war was coming to an end, he became a governor of a part which was annected from Poland from the German territory there. And he took her there, and they had another two sons, but they not living as Jews. And they very talented boys. And when it came in Poland the time where Jews moved from Poland to Israel in 1965 I guess, was it? Something like this. They came, first time she told the sons that they are Jewish and they were already both matriculated after high school diploma. And one of them was already studying engineering. And they came to Israel. But their father, himself, he in the meantime, being a governor he studied at the university at the same time to become an agronom... agronomy. And he came to Israel as an agronom. But because Israel didn\u2019t have confidence to all these apparatchiks from Poland. I mean all this communist active parties, he couldn\u2019t find a job. It was very difficult to find. And we were already at this time in Israel and I had some connection with people and to a member of the Israel Parliament. And I wrote to them and I warranted about him, that he\u2019s not one of the Russian services and he got a job in agronomy. But he passed away about six or seven years ago. In the meantime, the older son is working in a very high, secret Israel Army factory. And the other son was also an engineer, but in the same time he was teaching in a school, in a vocational school. And married a girl from Venezuela. And one year ago they decided that they leave Israel and they came to the United States. And he got a job here in California. He must be very, very important engineer, because he got the, he made the green card and he can work and they bought a house. But they have one son, who 1s at the Israel Army. And just now I heard, two weeks ago, he went to Israel and asked to give him some off in the Army. And he came to visit him here to the United States. He will not stay. He will go back to Israel. But he decided, his wife and with the other two children to stay in the United States."

I wasn\u2019t never, never... even being young, following all the instructions and prescriptions, but I was never strictly convinced that that was what I want to do. I was always looking on the broad world, and life was for me, more interesting outside the religious life."

That\u2019s wherever I am, I found my obligation to be honest and I could avoid serving in the Polish Army which wasn\u2019t easy. It wasn\u2019t easy. It was very difficult. But it wasn\u2019t voluntary, because Poland was an Army which was called to the Army. That was not a voluntary army. You have to go, by twenty-one everyone has to go to the army except that somebody 1s unable to fulfill the demand, sick and so forth. And a lot of my colleagues and a lot of Jewish people usually they started to do everything to avoid to go into the Polish Army. I didn\u2019t try it even. And I did it full hearted and I think it was my obligation to do it, because I owe it. I understand that it 1s a common responsibility when you are a citizen of a country, you live there, you have to do what belongs. But politically I was never involved in any movement, never any movement."

            "answer": "It was a time I was involved in Zionist organization. It was a time I thought maybe one has to go to Palestine those times. I will not deny there was not in Poland anti-Semitism. But you know anti-Semitism until today has many faces. There is an economic anti-Semitism, there is a political anti-Semitism and there is a racist anti-Semitism. And for me and my observance, my conviction, I think if I analyze the Jewish situation in Poland, it was more economic anti- Semitism, with some reasons, objective reasons. They were nobody\u2019s fault, but the situation became so that this anti-Semitism has his logical reasons, logical reasons, maybe it shouldn\u2019t be, maybe it is nobody\u2019s fault, but it was. I cannot say there was a racial anti-Semitism. Well, there is in every nation, there are some extreme people, which they can get... and they are more doing it for personal reasons and for gaining something of it. And this is also the political anti- Semitism, which is to gain something to rule over people. You know? And Jews were more educated, absolutely more educated than the common people in Poland. Because as I told you before, I started to study when I was three. You know, and this gives, whatever you study, it gives you more advance about people which are just starting to study something at the age of eight or nine or ten even. Some of them didn\u2019t go to school, the Polish people didn\u2019t go to school ever. There was illiteracy, too. So, when it came to elections, the Jews, they knew what they wanted. And the masses didn\u2019t know. Maybe it is until today a lot of masses don\u2019t know when they are going to vote, what they need and what they want. It is until today everywhere. But especially in a country like Poland, which was, which wasn\u2019t so educated. There was a lot of people who didn\u2019t have, it was only by propaganda, which was from mouth to mouth, from promises and so forth, you know. And then Poland, I would need to go into the situation of Poland, how Poland became free after being occupied by three countries."

In the Russian occupied part they couldn\u2019t progress like this we could make in the Austro-Hungarian or in the German occupied territory. So here comes the difference. Education, knowledge and education, that was, is and that would always be the point. And this gave also the impulse for political views and for a kind of organized anti-Semitism, which for the Jews, for the victims, it is not important what kind of anti-Semitism it is. He is anti-Semite, why and what, we didn\u2019t analyze and that wasn\u2019t important. We had to feel it and that what it is."

            "question": "Were you discriminated against at all for being Jewish during your service?",
            "answer": "It\u2019s difficult to say that you were discriminating because Army is not the thing which gives you the time. You have so many things to do that you don\u2019t have the time to play these games. But, but, the officers, the Polish officers generally, generally, were anti-Semites. What kind? They were so educated, they were so prepared. That was the elite. That they, but of course, they didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t want to show up as anti-Semites. But you could feel it, you could feel it. Not everybody felt it. And then like I said, the poorer Jews went to the Army because they were not able to pay to get free from the Army, not to serve. The rich Jews who didn\u2019t want to go to the Army, there was always finding a way of bribery. To whom? To the Polish officers, to the Polish doctors, to the Polish secretaries, so that they made themselves sick and they write and they are sick and they cannot serve. And so the poor and little Jews were serving in the Army. There were no too many of the intelligentsia which was serving in the Army. And then there was another thing. After matriculation you are going to the officer\u2019s school. And in the officer\u2019s school, they didn\u2019t want the Jews to become officers. They were there because they were, after matriculation that was the law. So usually they find always a way to send them back to the normal Army, not to live in the school to become an officer. There were officers, Jewish officers, but very few, very few. It was difficult to advance, to be a Jew and to be an officer, a high officer in the Polish Army. There were higher officers only medical officers, because they needed them. They have to take them and that\u2019s what it was."

And they phone to me, they knew that I would go liberated, if I will be able to replace him, to fill out that position.

Where I was there on this farm, there the Armia Krajowa started to organize herself. And we came there, and I went there as a refuge, refugee from the occupied territory, German-occupied territory which occupied Poland from Poznan. I said I am from Poznan, and I am hiding away because I was a Polish officer and I am hiding from the German Army. So when they became knowledge, they turned to me and maybe I will join them. And I said, \u201cWell I cannot be a fighter to go and, with your fighting.\u201d I went with them sometimes. But I organized a sanitary station, when some of them were wounded they brought them to me and I gave them some bandages or some treatments, which I had a sanitary station. And I also took care on the weapons which they had, and the magazine. They had some magazine in hiding in the shelter. And they had some weapons there, which they organize somehow. And I was taking, cleaning and taking care of it. And that was my function, I was going there and there, I was going close to every night I am going there and taking care of it.

            "answer": "I will approach to you a little bit. They had their spies which are spying what happens to the Polish people there. What they are talking about and what they are doing. And some of them denounced that there is some activity, that they have some activity. And they choose Easter, 1943, yeah? 1943 they choose to go to make an action and to arrest these Polish people who are in the underground. They knew from this people which they send in this Volksdeutsche and they took there ten people. Between them was the commandant of this base. His name was Bilig (ph), Bilig (ph). He was a student of law, of the third year, second or third year. He was the commandant of this unit there in this region. And there was other, there was a teacher and there was several people. And one was liberated by the Germans. That was suspected that he was collaborating with the Germans. They released him. The other nine were taken to Auschwitz. This commandant was so beaten up that he couldn\u2019t survive. Because one of these people who 8 was release, he saw him. That they took him from one room to other after hearings. They took him. He was all blooding. He didn\u2019t survive. No one of them survived. So the commandant of this part was the brother of this woman where we were working on this farm. His name was Kostetski (ph). Max Kostetski (ph). And this lady, which we were there on this farm, she was a very fine, noble person. She knew that we are Jewish. She knew because when we arrived there, the brother of the priest was there, just there. And he was very angry. He said to the priest, \u201cWhat did you bring these Jews here? Why did you do it?\u201d And he run away very angry. And she knew, but she was a very, very [phone rings] fine, noble person. And she tried to influence her brother. I am an officer and so forth. And she was helping us a lot with bread, with food, everywhere. Even when we later on, after the denunciation, we had to live in other place. She used to come to bring us bread and all kinds of things. She did help us. I think maybe fifty percent of surviving we had to thank her. She was very, very, very kind."

            "question": "What was anti-Semitic about him? Why do you say that?",
            "answer": "He was anti-Semite, but he was, in my opinion he was economic anti-Semite. However, he didn\u2019t have a business. But in the church he was preaching the Polish people to support Polish people, to buy at Polish people, but most of the businesses were Jewish. And therefore Jews were calling all of this kind of expression, they were calling anti-Semite. That was economical anti-Semitism. They want to support their own people. I don\u2019t find it wrong. I don\u2019t find it wrong. I think he as a priest has an obligation to his people. How we didn\u2019t like it, how we didn\u2019t want it, but still 1t did hurt us economically. But he, as a human being and as a priest, he told us, \u201cI want to help you because it comes a bad time to you.\u201d So I cannot say he is a racist or he is a political anti-Semite. He was economical anti-Semite. He was anti-Semite. We are very sensitive. We Jews are very sensitive, but we have the reason why to be sensitive after thousands of years of discrimination. But still, 1f you have a little bit brain and you want to understand human nature, you can find some objective reasons why some people are behaving so, and not like you would like they will behave. We would like to be taken care on us as the Chosen People. But we are not the chosen, to take care on us. We are chosen because we have obligations. We choose to have the obligations. This is the chosen. We took the Ten Commandments, we took the Torah, we took everything, but we have to perform it. And if there is, you have to love your neighbor as yourself. You can never love like yourself, it is allegoric. But you don\u2019t have to harm your neighbor. You have to behave. And that, which in many cases we are missing. Even in the holy books we sometimes mention, \u201cWe are the Chosen People. You can do to other people this and this and this. You can take interest by non-Jews. You can do this, you can do this, but not to your brothers.\u201d And that was a segregation which was in the 9 Torah. There is segregation which we choose to make the segregation. This is the Chosen People, not only in the positive sense, a lot of things is negative. And therefore a lot of people who are open-minded, they are taking the teachings of our fathers, not strictly verbally. You make some selection. You have some humanitarian obligations as a human being, not blind to follow scriptures, but you have to find a way how to live with people, how to respect other people. Which is very, very important. How do you respect others, so others will respect you? And this is my conviction which I came after so many years of life and so many readings and studying of all, all this which is written in the Jewish and in the non-Jewish books and teachings. Well it\u2019s not a... if you know , introduction, but I mean you have to know to whom you are speaking. I think maybe sometimes I am going out of the framework which this has in mind, but I still am open-minded of everything what happens around."

You tried to join the Army, you kind of got caught underneath the Russian occupation and then you made your way back to your home village of Brzeznica? Is that right?

And that was, by some miracle, maybe the reason was the German discipline, which they followed the orders of the Commandants, of the Fuhrers. When I came to this camp, I volunteered. That was a working camp and therefore I was put into this camp as a dentist. There was no big dentistry and there was no big medicine, but still there was three medical doctors and there was rooms with beds, which in the beginning, which people when they got sick, even beaten when they were, they could come to the doctor. And they get care, they get care. In the beginning, even some times they were released from this to go to the town, to the little shtetl close to Debica there. There was other assignment to other works. But that was already not in their competence. In the beginning, how strange it would be, there was a Colonel, SS, who was the head of this health services there, Obersturmbanfuhrer (ph) Schumacher was his name. And then, but he was maybe for two or three weeks and started only, that was only in \u201840. That was not yet nothing. That was the first beginning. And therefore the Jews were slowly getting in circulating. They took him so easy, they took him so by easy. They were voluntary, then later by force and later on by annihilation. They were going by themselves. That was the system. And then after two or three weeks, he left. But that was an order officer. A lieutenant officer. End of Tape 1, Side B 10 Tape 2, Side A"

And that what he was doing another four weeks. But later on, they left it to the Jews, but the situation became worse. There was no releasing.

And that was the things. There was no other things, no fillings. I had to make fillings only when an SS man didn\u2019t want to go to the SS. They were not allowed to go to a Jewish dentist, not to a Polish even, nor to a German. They had to go to an SS. But they knew that they will have a special treatment at the Jewish dentist, so some of them came. And that was a very difficult task, because I didn\u2019t have, I didn\u2019t have this equipment, which the German have. The German has the most modern and the most equipment. The SS had the most modern. And there was a lot of cases, which I couldn\u2019t treat them at all, and I send them to go there. But they were insisting, they were insisting. And so in beginning, that was about a year. I had an ID, SS ID, that I could come to the camp and I left. The bus was standing, I show only the ID and I left. In the beginning the doctors were also leaving, living in Debica. And coming only to work there."

But I think, I am not sure, because I was there a volunteer, there was an order of the Commandant of this camp, of the head, Gillar (ph) SS Oberfiihrer, who gave, day order, which he gives to the soldiers every day orders. He said, \u201cThe Jewish dentist can come to the camp whenever he wants. And every time when he comes to the post they will give him a post who bring him in the camp and when he is finished, he will come to pick him up and take him out from the camp.\u201d That was unbelievable.

I was a volunteer, and I was assigned by the working office, the special working office, which gave the contingent for the camp, for the people. Bring them and give them to different works. And because of they gave me this job, I didn\u2019t belong to the SS, I belong all the time to the working office. And the head of this working office was a German, he became German. He was a German from origin. But he was Polish all the time. Only when the Germans came in, he became a German. And he was an officer in the Polish Army with a German name. Eilmiss (ph) was his name, Jule Eilmiss (ph). And he was very good to me. I was very good to him. I gave him from time to time, I gave him all kind of bribes. And maybe they respect because I was affiliated to this, maybe this was the reason that I didn\u2019t belong to the SS, I belong to the working. And that was the reason. And when I came to this post and I said, \u201cI am the Jewish dentist. I need to go to the camp, please give me company.\u201d And they give me an SS man, who brought me to the camp. By the entrance to the camp there was another SS man, but he respected this SS man, he gave me over to him. He opened the gate and let me in. And when I was ready, I went to the office and I said, \u201cI want to go out.\u201d They call to the camp, to the post, and the postman came and take me out from there. So, this is, everything is miraculous. Well, it is miracle that I am alive and that Iam here. But that was something which was really extraordinary.

A mile in Poland is like hundred miles here. Distances are different. And the other Jews were coming to us to study religious things by the teacher which we have in our house. And they were really poor Jews, poor Jews. It is difficult to describe. Well, in the last years, the situation improve. But I remember as a 13 child I came in the house of one of the oldest citizens in this village that has Haskila Ascheim (ph). And he had two sons... three sons, one went to the Austrian Army and later on to the Polish Army, because it was just a change from Polish liberalization. It was a widow with five children. Of course, the sons came to learn in our house. Not too much, not too much, but the basic prayers, the basic prayers they learned. The other son had also five children and they were very, very talented children, very talented children, but they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to school, only to the community school, I mean to the elementary school. But they were , they studied by themselves. And this two sons became even writers and the lawyer in the village there. And one of the sons became a dentist. And the daughter married. Not that this is the point. The point is that this three sons with their families, in the beginning there was here two children, here one child, the other one also two children. They were living in one house, where there was only three rooms. Of course no bathroom, nothing like this. In addition, in the big hall, this old Jew had a pub. He was selling alcohol to the Polish people were coming, drinking there. Everything in this one house. Later on they move on, they somehow organize them, their living. And they have their own houses. No one survived, as far as I know, of all these families. No one. Of all these villagers, no one survived. Only one son and a son- in-law went to America. But I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not more alive and I don\u2019t know if he had family. I don\u2019t know. One grandson came also to America with a very tricky way. His father, who was already in America, sent him a girl from the United States, which he married there, so he could travel to America. But he\u2019s not alive. He died. He was a sick boy.

Roznow (ph), that was a big dam which they built on the Danube River, not Danube, but Dunajec river. That was a big dam. There was a little one later of in Szczow where in the beginning the Jews built it. But that was only in 1941, \u201842. But later on they took away all the Jews in other camps. I don\u2019t know what they did to them. I don\u2019t know. And there was then a fight, which was quite a real fight with this police, but the Polish police hand over herself and the Germans, some escaped, some were killed. And that was the source where the AK gets more weapons there, from there. No, Iam not. You can hold it. I have here support. That was really when I, by my walking in the nights to the base where we have the weapons there, I met some of the AK men, which usually no AK men knew more than other two. That was a conspiracy. And interesting enough, the main active AK man in our unit, which was really an active guy, he was doing by himself a lot of things, he was a released criminal prisoner from Polish prison. And from him I got also for myself a gun, which I had one, but I didn\u2019t have enough ammunition for it. And he was the one who give me another gun and then I have some more ammunition, some more for security. [Phone rings.] I didn\u2019t use it because I didn\u2019t need it, but I was ready in case I will need it. I had a grenade and I had a weapon, I wouldn\u2019t go into prison voluntarily.

And through me was passing from this unit, through me to my unit. And that was already in 1944, by the end of 1944. I usually tried to know what happens because I didn\u2019t have a radio. I was relying on the news which I got from the acquaintance, what they get to me. But from this, from this orders who came, I found some orders what happens at the front. There was always messages what is to do and so forth. And the last message which I got, I opened it too. Then I close it and I send it farther.

You have to drink alcohol, the moonshine like they are and to do everything like they are doing when they come together. Even if you don\u2019t know them, but you have to go on the way like this. And if they are cursing, you have to curse, if 1t is damn, or another. You have to be always, not try to be different, not try to be different, that\u2019s the main point what you have to do. Scared? Of course, you are always scared. You know, when I was watching and going walking in the night from one village to the other, if I heard a frog jumping, my ears were so sensitive, I heared it. Because I want to know what happens around me, to be always prepared and always the hand on the gun. And I didn\u2019t continue to go until I found out what is this noise, if it is not people. I find the frog and then I continue to go. That\u2019s it."

And this Muschau was a very nice man, very nice man. And he was not like the common peasant. He was already more civilized because he was working in France as a miner, several years. And he came up from France. He brought some furniture from France. And he was already more progressive. And we exchanged different opinions about the situation, the political situation. About the Germans, about the Russians, so forth. We were politicizing. He was inviting me in his home. We are drinking and eating there. And he invite the neighbor. He has a neighbor there, one Kilbasa (ph), who came also and they want to hear what happens in the world. And I have also some news from my fellow man. So they accepted all the news from me as an intelligent Polish officer and Polish patriot, of course. And that was always, with the alcohol, with moonshine. I drank moonshine in my life, maybe I could make a bath in it and swim."

            "answer": "Well you could hear. First of all, there was a situation about four months, more than four months. The Russians stopped on the river, they didn\u2019t cross the river Vistula to help the Polish resistance, the Uprising in Poland for political reasons. They want the Poles to be annihilated by the Germans and then will go and kill the Germans. That was a very courageous thing to make from the Russian side. But that was a very, very bad thing instead to help to fight the Germans. The Germans killed a lot of Polish people. And of course, a lot between them the Jewish, which were fighting with the Poles, from the rest which remained there between the Poles. And we have all the news about the uprisings. There was, in the bunker where the commandant, ours, was sitting, they had a radio, which they are listening to Radio London, from London, BBC, they have all the news and the movements of the Russian Army. And I knew in one day they brought to me, two English pilots, who escaped from the camp, from the German camp, and I had to transport them to the Russians, because the United States had air bases in Russia. Because the United States were already allies with the Russians. And I was already, I said already good bye to Fryda and I was already on the way to go. But in the meantime when they came to the next base they told me not to go farther because the field are mined everywhere. I will not be able to cross. So I left them at this Polish unit there AK where I brought them there and I came back to Fryda there. And we are waiting the other four months and then you didn\u2019t need the knowledge, 17 you heared the bombardment with the Russians started on the river there, from a distance to bombard artillery. And then they started to move. And that was it. And so we became so-called liberated."

He was by himself, he said, if I will catch a Jew, I will cut in pieces and they should salt on it. As I said, he was a very, very bad anti-Semite. His parents were not anti-Semites. They were very simple peasants. They didn\u2019t understand and think about it. Well, they boarded Jews and they went to the shtetl, they had their acquaintance with Jews. But of course they preferred, they loved the Polish and the Catholic. It 1s normal, it is normal. But they didn\u2019t hate especially the Jews. But the son, which was already studying priesthood and they knew already, they told him already, at this time they were still teaching that the Jews killed Jesus and so forth.

            "answer": "It was a very, very, very mixed feeling. On one side you felt the Russians are coming, you will not be more in danger as a Pole, but as a Jew, you continue to be in danger. And then came the reality. You find out what happened. Because until now, you heared only, they killed here, they killed here, they killed here. But the disaster so big, you realized only slowly when you were liberated. When you came to the big city, Krakow, which has before the war, in the war even, in the beginning, ninety thousand Jews and you barely find five or six people which are Jews. That was a trauma which you couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t hand it. You were, and you were asking by yourself, why me? Why didn\u2019t Anna do what I did? You start to analyze and to understand and those are things that you cannot understand until today. Because there were wiser people than me, speaking Polish better than me or the same like me, having connection with people. Why didn\u2019t they survive? Why didn\u2019t they choose our way? Was it right we did? And what is the 18 role we have to play by being alive? Try to organize a Jewish life, or forget about it? No Jews, no Jewish life. You are Polish. Go on, be a Pole. And that\u2019s what many Jews do it, did it. And there are until today Jews which are living as Poles. They said, \u201cForget about it.\u201d But we couldn\u2019t do it. Our roots are too strong. I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know what to do. We didn\u2019t know what to do. We were poor like mices. We had to look, to find something to eat, not to speak about finding a way to organize your life, to start to be a human being. You are out of it, you are no human anymore. You start to realize you live surrounded in animosity. And you look for some Jews. And I found some. I remember the first night we didn\u2019t have where to go. No home. But somehow we met somebody. I don\u2019t remember. I think I knew these people or recognize them as Jews. And I did ask him, \u201cWho else is here?\u2019\u201d\u2019 He said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d And I went with him, or with her better. And we came in a dark room and there were already several Jewish people, survivors from all kinds of surviving. And we sit there in this room, in this dark room and started to sing Jewish songs, Yiddish songs, very nostalgical Jewish songs. All the Yiddish songs were sad, all were sad. But in this moment, they were healing. They were like Balsam on a wound. Remembrance for a moment, your heritage. And we passed this night, I don\u2019t remember, on songs and somehow sleeping sitting on a broken couch. All together there were maybe six, seven people. And each one with his song, not with story. We didn\u2019t talk yet about story. We, somehow, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. Is it shame or 1s it... I don\u2019t know. But we are here. We left everything behind and we are sitting here. Nostalgia, remembering Yiddish songs. Don\u2019t think even what to do, where to go farther. But we woke up in the morning, woke up. We didn\u2019t take our work clothes. We were in the clothes which we had, these poor clothes. We find out from one of them that one of my friends survived. Where is he? Who 1s it? He was before the war, he was a lady beautician parlor. Father was a barber, and he had a nice sister. And I used to come to their house before the war. And he survived on papers. But he was already in the Russian intelligence. Polish uniform, the Russian intelligence. And somehow I met him. I don\u2019t remember exactly how. And I asked him, \u201cWhat is to do. Where to go? I don\u2019t have a house. I don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d He said, \u201cI got back my apartment.\u201d There are two bedrooms, a kitchen on the third floor in the Jewish section. But he says, \u201cYou can go there. And somehow we will find there some way to sleep.\u201d But there were already some people in, which survived Auschwitz. That was a girl, a boy, and another girl. And then came other people. I don\u2019t know who this were. We all were there, but we didn\u2019t have a bed to sleep. We slept on the floor. And I decided, we decided to look around, and we went to my village. To this older woman, who took us on. And she fed us, she gave us to eat. And we left in their house some of our clothes, some of our furnishes. And she was already, she, not her son, who lived nearby... because my mother, my grandmother, my brother\u2019s sister lived in her house and I lived in the son\u2019s house. There I make a little clinic there in his house. And we went there to sleep in the night in his house. In the night, somebody was knocking at the door and the window. And there\u2019s, in Russian, \u201cKroy (ph)! Open! You have here Jews!\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t have Jews. They are Polish people like you, like we.\u201d They came in. He opened, because this was soldiers which were in the camp, where there was once a camp. There was a field hospital for wounded Russian soldiers. And this were wounded soldiers which were there in this, but they were strong enough to go in between the Poles and to make connections with them. And I understand, I am not sure, I am ninety-nine percent sure. They went to the rich Poles where we left a lot of things and he told them to go there, the Jews came here. You have to kill them, very simple. And for them to kill a Jew is like kill a German. They like a soldier, especially a wounded soldier, a front soldier. And they came in and said, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d 19 And I understand Ukrainian, too, because in the Polish Army where I served there were mostly Ukrainians there. I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no Jews here.\u201d \u201cWho are you?\u201d We had the papers. Said, \u201cWe are here, only sleeping here. We are Polish.\u201d Well, okay, they left. They went to the house of the mother, the mother\u2019s house and they the same. \u201cWhere are the Jews here?\u201d \u201cThere are no Jews.\u201d They gave some shots in the air and they left. In the morning we said to the son of our, we told him to help us to move. We want to move back to Krakow. But there was no communication, there was no train. And I want to take some of this furniture to have something to sleep. So, he took the horse of his mother and the other horse from a neighbor and a wagon and we started to move to Krakow. That is about sixty miles from, hundred kilometers, hundred ten kilometers, something like this."

            "answer": "It was 22\u2122) no 25\" of January, 1945, after the Russians came in. We start there the way to Krakow. It is not describable the conditions. We had to take food for the horses first because you couldn\u2019t buy this. Nobody would sell it. The money didn\u2019t have any value anymore. And the horses, if you don\u2019t feed them, they will not go. And you have to have the food on the way back, too. So the most of the wagon was food. And we took also some of the furniture which we left there and some of clothings we left there, also. They took it out from the ground, they dig it out. And they give us back everything, everything. They were very honest people. On the way my wife was more dead than alive. She was fainting and I had to do, to work on her. And by the way we were going around way, it was a longer way but more secure. ; where the army wasn\u2019t going. I knew the Polish geography very well. I know how I will get to Krakow by longer, around ways. We came to an ort (ph), which was called Zakroczym. First of all we passed a place which is called Tochow (ph). At Tochow there used to live a sister of my mother, with her family. Her husband, her daughter with her husband. I don\u2019t know how many children she had in the meantime. And the sons all run away to Russia, and they survived in Russia. The husband too, the old husband, too. But he died in Siberia, in Russia. They all were sent to Siberia to Infada (ph), to Sever (ph), to Jakutz (ph), or Jakutzia (ph). That was where they banished all the criminals in the older country revolutions there. With all the history there, there were trees which ten people have to surround it. Such a tree, such forest. And they 20 brought them there and they said to them, \u201cHere you have to live.\u201d No houses. Their houses were from snow, and their windows were from ice. And they had to work there, but all right that\u2019s about them. That\u2019s another story. But I came to this Tochow. And I did ask the Polish people there because no Jew was there, \u201cWhat happens?\u201d They said, \u201cAll were killed and some remained they were sent to the ghetto at Tarnow.\u201d That was the end. No one Jew was there. No one Jew. So I continued to the next shtetl which was Zakroczym. And of course we have to feed the horses. And we want to come down to move a little bit like I say to you, to try if we can go. We were sitting on the wagon all the time. And this poor Polish guy, this Soltys Stanislaw was with us, he was the foreman. And while we wanted to come down, Fryda fell down on the ground, fainted again. I save her. I put her on the ground laying down, make some exercises with her. Put her on the wagon back, she faint again several times. And when we fed the horses, we went to continue to go. But the night approach and in the night you couldn\u2019t, you are not allowed because it is curfew. The Russians didn\u2019t joke. Whom they found on the street they killed. So, I went to the first Polish house there where there was a little bit space... End of Tape 2, Side B 21 Tape 3, Side A"

She is dead already. Better one to put in the grave, like she is looking.\u201d But I took, outside I found a brick, an old brick. I put it, make a fire and warm up the brick and I warm up a little bit. And so at this house, on the floor, we slept through until the morning. In the morning we start to go, and we went and we came to Krakow. We went to this house of our friend there and we put what we have, these little furnishes on the dirt floor. This guy helped us, Stanislaw Soltys helped us. And he went back with the horses, back to his home, he had to give back the horse to the neighbor. That was sacrificing. I don\u2019t know how he did it or why he did it. It was not human, that was angel work. In this time to go back, to endanger the horses, which is all what the people have, a horse, a cart, but he did it. And she gave us a little products, half a bread, which was the big peasant breads, and some beans, some barley, and we\u2019 Il have something to cook and to eat. That was our food at the beginning. And so we are being there with all this people around us, other people living there. And Fryda went to the house, which was their house before the war, their apartment. And there was the janitor of the house, which was the janitor before the war. He was a carpenter working in their furniture store. A dirty, drunk man. And she said to him, \u201cMaybe there will come some post here on this address. We are here living...\u201d and she gave the address where we are living. And he, \u201cAnd what will be if I bring you a post from your father?\u201d And she says, \u201cWell, you will get a hug and a kiss.\u201d He said, \u201cAll right.\u201d A few days later he came with a card, post card from Auschwitz. And he said, \u201cPana Fryda (ph), Miss Fryda, I get a kiss.\u201d And she give him a kiss and a hug. \u201cI got post card from your father.\u201d And we have this post card. You saw it I guess. And he is sick and he asks to come to pick him up. In the meantime, I met another acquaintance of me. He had a dental office, quite a primitive office, but a dental office in an apartment which wasn\u2019t his. It did belong to a Jewish woman before the war. She was even the owner of the house. And she and her daughter survived. But in this moment, she wasn\u2019t there yet. She was in a camp somewhere. And I met him and I said to him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell I have here a dental office. But I\u2019m leaving this office. I want to sell it because I am leaving to the once German territory. There I will organize a modern dental office, an apartment and I will be living there.\u201d He married, he survived as a partisan. He married a Polish, Gentile woman. And he lived together with her. I guess he had some children with her already. But he was, he was a partisan in the Socialistic, not in the AK, in the AL, that was Armia Ludowa. That was the Volks party. And they were more lenient to the Jews. And he was a good fighter. He was a strong guy and he was really fighting there, in this army. And he said, \u201cMy party will help me to organize there.\u201d I said to him, \u201cSell me your office here, for a begin, it will be good for me.\u201d He said, \u201cI will not sell you. I will rent it to you because maybe I don\u2019t find nothing there. I will come back.\u201d Said, Okay. I can\u2019t give you nothing. I don\u2019t have nothing. But for the first money what I will make as a dentist I will send it to you somehow.\u201d And I start to organize a practice. And I had first of all, aroom to sleep, a nice room to sleep with a bed, with a couch, quite a nice room and a nice kitchen. And that was for the moment a wonderful solution. But I started to think, \u201cIf he did it, 22 maybe I can do the same. I will go to the German occupied, German-Polish occupied territories, Poland occupies German territories. And there were a lot of dentists and dentist equipment and I will organize my clinic there. And to live there.\u201d And I went there, but I didn\u2019t find nothing which I would like. So I left Fryda there. We met there another guy, a survivor who was already working for the Polish security, in the Polish security. He wrote a book about it. He lives here in the United States. He became a very rich guy here. And he became an officer. He survived in his village there. However they were trying to kill him from the AK, too. But he survived somehow. And he was in this part which became occupied by the Russians first, the first month there. And the Polish units there sent him to an officer\u2019s school and he became an officer 1n the Polish security. And then when the Russians moved, he moved with them. He came to Krakow. And he make a lot of, find a lot of Polish people whom, whom he gave over to, handed over to the Polish security. But while the Russians occupied the German part, they sent him to Wroclaw as an officer there of their security. And then they send him to Lidnice, Lidnitz, where we were. And where I was looking for some dental equipment, he was working 1n his job to look for Germans. And we met. And we make a recognition as a Jew and he as a Jew. We didn\u2019t talk too much about it. He said, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I said, \u201cYou can help me to find some...\u201d He said, he\u2019 Il try."

That was a man who was taller than me and he was fifty-six pounds, I guess. I took in a blanket a heap of bones. And I was waiting for a truck to take him to Krakow. But that was before we left to the occupied territories there. And Fryda took care of him, and he came to his quite normal. But that was already February when we left for... even more later, maybe March already. It is difficult now to remember the dates exactly. So we left Father in this apartment where we lived. We left to him. And we went to look for, find some existence there with the idea maybe we\u2019ll take him over there to us."

            "answer": "Not too much. All what Father-in-law told us. I didn\u2019t have the time and the courage to go to look what happens around. But he had enough to recount his stories of what happens during the time. But on the way back from this occupied territory to Krakow, I have a car accident. And I have broken my leg, my hand here, and I was taken to the hospital instead to go home. Somehow I could let know Fryda that I am in the hospital. That was everything through people, which are communicating, commuting there and back. So, she came back. She decided to come back. She didn\u2019t have money, not even for to pay the Russians to give the vodka for commuting with them. But while she was at this friend\u2019s house, he became our good friend, this officer, this Tadek Zalewski. His wife, she was Jewish too, she survived also on Christian papers. She said, \u201cT can\u2019t give you anything money.\u201d She want to give her some jewelry, but Fryda didn\u2019t want to take it. But while she was sleeping, she put in her bag a golden bracelet. And Fryda when she got up, she said, \u201cWhat is this yet? I didn\u2019t have a bracelet.\u201d She said, \u201cTake it, you\u2019Il need it. Take it, youll need it. I don\u2019t need it now. Someday you\u2019ll pay me back.\u201d I don\u2019t remember if she took it. I guess she took it and she came back to me, to the hospital. And she had to take care of this poor father and of this poor husband. In the meantime, we got connection by mail with a brother of her father, an uncle, Uncle Solomon in the United States. And when he heard that his brother survived, that we survived, he open... in Krakow, an open account. \u201cHow much you need, you can have and take.\u201d And there was the connection who gave us the possibility to survive further. But that was already a few months later, because mail didn\u2019t function so easy."

            "answer": "Well, I didn\u2019t think so much about Poland. I didn\u2019t want to stay with the Russians. I knew the Russians before. Poland I wouldn\u2019t mind, even, to stay, because I had my roots there, you know? With all minuses I thought I would be able to organize a good life in Poland, even I thought in my dreams, on our farm. I said, I will keep the farm. I'll keep a clinic there, help the people. And having a nice living on the farm. I love the farm too. We have a big farm, a nice farm. And it was the nicest farm in the village. I thought sometimes that will be okay. But when I thought about the Russians and the system of their, when they bring in, I would not have 24 the farm and I would not have my freedom so I start to think to move from Poland somewhere. Somewhere, the nearest approach was to Belgium, where Fryda has a brother of her father. In the beginning we want to go to Germany, because one of my brothers, who lives now in the United States, came to visit us in Poland. He couldn\u2019t take us. When he came only for two or three days. And he saw our misery there and he tried to help us what he could. And he said, \u201cCome in Germany we have apartment. You\u2019ll make a living there for time being. Come there.\u201d And we found a way where they were repatriating German families from Poland to Germany. So there was a woman, she came to our house. She was making all kind of businesses, a Jewish woman from Krakow. And she had the connection how to organize, to join people who want to go to Germany with the German repatriates. We left our apartment. We went to Katowice, which was on the border to Germany. But when we came there, we were there two days, there was no transport going to Germany. They already, the last transport left. And you have to wait another month or two and I couldn\u2019t wait in Katowice there, so we decided to go back to Krakow there. And in Krakow we stayed there until, I guess it was August, I guess, when we find a connection which somebody make passports with a visa to Costa Rica for five hundred dollar each passport. And the uncle from United States gave us the money and we paid thousand five hundred. But we could get a transit visa through Belgium, because there was no straight flights. There was no flight at all. You have to go by train to Belgium. And from Belgium you could have gone to a flyer, a ship to Costa Rica. But when we came to Belgium, we remained in Belgium. And we stayed in Belgium for five years."

With ten thousand dollars in Israel you could do a lot, you could do a lot. But my father said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want.\u201d He was much older than my mother. My mother was young.

            "question": "Okay, it\u2019s now May 30, 2000, and we\u2019re continuing our interview with Mr. Oscar Haber. And why don\u2019t we start by going back, you had talked on the last tape about the day of your liberation. And just to remind you, what you had talked about, we were, you talked about how afterwards you had met up with some other Jews and you were singing some old Yiddish songs. And then you described going back to your hometown and then back to Krakow. The thing that I wasn\u2019t sure about, that I didn\u2019t quite understand is, did you immediately leave the town where you were after liberation? And do you remember saying good-bye to the family that you were staying with?",
            "answer": "Well, the question of liberation is one of the most difficult time from all the past problems which we had. We were, as I told you, living as Christians. And the liberation came. We couldn\u2019t enjoy our liberation or country. It was the greatest shock and the most difficult moment in our lives. That was the liberation. And especially if I want to put it in perspective, the differences between people who survived camps and people who lived on so-called Aryan papers was very different. We have two things to overcome. The first 1s, which we had all the time, that was the fight for existence and how to survive, of course. And the next, when the liberation came was the shock to find the reality. You don\u2019t have where to go. You couldn\u2019t find nobody you know, or anybody of your people. You suddenly find yourself, you cannot stay in the place where you were. We were in a village, not ina town. We were ina village. And if I... realize it was a hostage village. They were not sympathetic to Jewish survivors. However I survived, not a Jew, but suddenly I felt that Iam back a Jew. But I couldn\u2019t officially declare it. I had to stay on my Aryan papers. And how to go and where to go? Because to go to my other village where I was born there, I wasn\u2019t sure that I will be accepted. And I wasn\u2019t sure to go to Krakow, for example, because I didn\u2019t have where to go. Even not where to sleep at night. And you don\u2019t have money. And you don\u2019t have nothing because whatever you had you have already sold out whatever you had. So, that was the most terrible time in all this events which we had, the so- called liberation was the terrible hit of the reality. You were hit with the reality. Not where to go and not what to do and how to start. Will you be accepted as a Jew? You cannot go on and to say you are not a Jew, because really where you go they know you are Jew when you come to the places where I used to live. And to stay in a strange, foreign surrounding like we were before, so I have to stay like I was all the time, a peasant, a farmer. To watch the horse and the cows. In reality I was a dentist. I want to go back. I didn\u2019t have nothing with me, but I have to go to start to look for our existence. And as I said before already that part, I went to the village where I was born, and then later when they went with us to Krakow, all this trouble I have with Fryda and when I came to Krakow. But the question of this liberation, to explain it in a very simple term, that was the greatest shock of everything together. But when I came to Krakow, when I started to settle as I said, I have been there, different places, start to organize my life. And with the help of the uncle which came, we went to Belgium as I said. And in Belgium we became refugees. We became as one of the United Nations refugees. We registered there and I have my register card as a refugee from the United Nations. And I got the permit because I had a visa only to stay there, transit visa to pass through Belgium. But because I was recognized as a refugee, they gave me time to stay three months there. In three months I had to renew my stay in Belgium. And we were under the auspicion of the foreign police, a special department, the etranger (ph), police etranger. And they gave us another stay of three months. 27"

Because his house was on the, on the border. Where the front was standing between the Russians and the Germans and there was heavy fire because there was the Dunajec river. And he was close to this river, not far. So he decided, the frontier between the Germans and the Russians, which was standing about four or five months was very close to this place. And his house was under fire, so he decided to come to his sister place, and while he opened the door, a bullet cut his left hand. And he was bleeding and because he knew that the underground station, sanitary station was in my place, so he decided that the neighbor took him on a wagon and he brought him to me there to give him first help. And I cut him. It was hanging on the skin, this hand. I cut on this and I bind around that he doesn\u2019t bleed out and I went back with him together and brought him to his house. And there I found out a really surgeon doctor was hiding there in the underground army and they brought him to this house. I gave him the anesthesia, whichever it could be a little bit chloroform. But most anesthesia was I gave him alcohol. We had there moonshine, moonshine. And he was drinking so he was out of conscious. And this surgeon bind him, all these veins and arteries. First of all, he cut him a little bit of this arm farther because it was already gangrenous, gangrene, because where I bound it there it started, it is very fast process. He cut it there and bind all the arteries and veins and so he survived. And then I didn\u2019t go more to the place of the sister, but I stayed with him and took care on him all the time. So he survived and he was thankful to me and I was very thankful to him. So it was a very, very good occasion to serve this man, this very nice person."

So there was standing a lot of people and waiting for this ride. So the Russian driver which was taking said, \u201cYou yes, you can go. You yes, yes.

That was individual soldiers, some of them which were, I don\u2019t know, they were from some other nationality as Russians or Ukrainians or Belorussians or Lithuanians or Latvians. There were all kinds of soldiers there. So that was more individual and then it was also sometimes inspired by some other anti-Semites to go to kill a Jew. The Russians didn\u2019t hesitate to kill a Jew, too. However it came in the Polish Army, which was a Polish unit in the Russian Army. In this unit there were many Jews, I mean for us, many... five was many. Because we used already without Jews here in this side, the German side. But there were some Jews and the times when the Jews didn\u2019t hear, you could hear... I understand Russian and Ukrainian, too. So, I could hear how they were expressing themselves anti-Semitic even to their officers and to their sergeants. \u201cThese dirty Jews,\u201d and so forth. So this is the reality like it was. 29"

And he was poor, but he already contact his other brother, younger brother in Holland, in England. The youngest brother, who changed his name from Himmelblau to Hill. And then he became recognized by the Queen as a British officer, decorated. And he already makes good business. He was quite already a rich man. And he did help him. And also this uncle from the United States, he opened us a place in Antwerp where we can take the money, how to survive our time. But I didn\u2019t want to be supported. I organize, even illegal, a little clinic, and I treated Jewish patients, refugees who came there. And there was a yeshiva, an orthodox yeshiva, which I treat without money this all students there. And I don\u2019t know if I told you, one day came in a student. And you know whoever it comes you started to talk, \u201cWhere from are you? How do you survive? Where did you been?\u201d And there came in a yeshiva boy. A nice, pretty wonderful 30 boy. And I ask him, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I am from Krakow.\u201d \u201cFrom Krakow? We are also from Krakow.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d He was happy to hear that we are from Krakow. \u201cWhere did you live in Krakow?\u201d He said, \u201cWell in Diver (ph) Street, number four,\u201d and this house was the Himmelblau house of the house of my wife\u2019s family. And I remembered his father. And Fryda knew his brothers and sisters, they were living in the same house for so many years. And he started to cry and Fryda started to cry. I called in Fryda. In my clinic, I had a corner in my bedroom where I put in an engine, a foot engine and actually did the patients, somehow. But slowly I make a living off it and I had a possibility to make a decent living. So, I stopped the help of my uncle. I didn\u2019t want to be supported. In the meantime, as we have been there for close to two years, Israel was established. And I was already connected with the Zionist organization there in Antwerp. I was a member of the committee there. So I said, \u201cI want to go to Israel.\u201d Well, Fryda\u2019s father didn\u2019t want to go. He preferred to stay in Antwerp. Well, he knew the languages and he had his brother there and he had the support from this two brothers, so he decided he will not go with us. In the meantime, our son was born.

And when I decide we are going, we organize. We brought everything, because in Israel we knew there is nothing, refrigerators and the stove, furniture, hardware, what we need for the kitchen for a living. We took everything. We took several lifts and we went to Marseilles by train. And from Marseilles we went by boat, by the Kadma (ph). It was quite a nice boat. And that was my son\u2019s second birthday on this ship.

We were waiting that he will be able to make this transport. In April of \u201851 we left for Israel. We were so far fortunate that our friend from Antwerp, who 1s also from Krakow, left for Israel a year before us. And he rented a house there with two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom. And they invited us that we would be able to stay with them for the first day until we find a place to stay. Because that was no other way. And we came to them, we stayed with them. And the lift arrived. There was a yard there, we could put the lift there. We were searching for an apartment. And we rented an apartment, which was a living room and a bedroom, a hall, a kitchen and a bathroom. That was all."

And that was a settlement which was in development and that was, to compare, a little bit cheaper. And I didn\u2019t have enough money to buy an apartment. We rented an apartment. And we organized there. I organized in these three rooms, the hall was the waiting room, the bedroom was the clinic. And there was a bed which was in the day, closed like a cabinet. In the day I could accept patients. And the living room was the bedroom for us. We were sleeping there in the bedroom. And the child was there. There was a terrace. It was nice. After working there about two years we rented, just close, became free another big room and a kitchen and a little hall. So we rented this, and... excuse me. We bought it. I bought it. In the meantime I bought this apartment where you are renting. I bought this apartment. And I made of both of them one bigger apartment and a separate clinic. And life became more comfortable. We organized a very nice apartment and a very nice living in this room."

            "answer": "Well maybe it is not known in the world and people are more concentrated on Poland and Polish anti-Semites in Germany. But Belgium, which seems to be more sympathetic to the Jewish case... in Antwerp, where there was quite a number of Jews, when you were looking for an apartment for rent, it was in the windows written, \u201cNot for foreigners.\u201d And that meant not for Jews. In some of the apartments was written exactly what I said, \u201cNo Jews.\u201d And I in the meantime learned to speak Flemish, which was the language in Antwerp, because Brussels was more French. But Antwerp was Flandria. That was the the part of... Belgium has two nations, Valonia and Flandria. The Flandrians were more, more German sympathetic. They were German oriented. Valonians were more French oriented. And Jews which were saved in Belgium, they mostly were more saved in this part which was Valonian. In Flandria there was impossible to survive. We came, rented an apartment. And still we were all the time renting there. And that was a nice apartment. We love it. And the administrator showed us the apartment and the conditions where it was not expensive. It was nice and the place was nice. And when it came to write the lease, he says, \u201cYes, but you are not strangers.\u201d And we said, \u201cYes, we are strangers. We are from Poland.\u201d And he said, \u201cBut you are not Jews?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, we are Jews.\u201d So, \u201cI am sorry, I have instructions from my... I am not the owner, from the owner, no Jews. I am sorry, no Jews.\u201d And that gave me a lot to think about it. Around you see no friends, no friendly, no foreigners, no Jews. So that means there is no place to live here for the Jews. However there is a lot Jews remained there and lived there. They didn\u2019t care about it. But I was, I don\u2019t know, personally more sensitive realizing this problem. I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be, that can happen the same everywhere.\u201d And therefore I decided to go home. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the one place where nobody would tell me as a Jew you have to live. You have all the rights.\u2019 And that was the reason."

            "answer": "Yes. After I became involved in my profession. In the dental association I became one of the active members in the management of the organization. I became vice-president of the organization of the dental association in Israel. And because a big part of Jewish dentists in Israel, their origin was countries where they spoke German. If 1t was Czechoslovakia, even Poland, they spoke more German than Yiddish, or even Yiddish, they could understand German. And there was a necessity, there was not world literature in Hebrew in this profession. And we were interested as these people became more educated and more acquainted in the profession, which made progress terrible. Progress during the five years and then later on and on all the time. And there was English literature, which the people didn\u2019t know. I spoke already a little bit English, but not enough to be fluent in literature or to give a lecture in English. The University has some professors which were lecturing in English. But for the mass, I mean for the majority of the dentists it wasn\u2019t understandable. So we needed German-speaking lectures. And time by time, we start to bring in from Germany lecturers, professors. And so I became acquainted with these professors. And we started to exchange normal relations between them. So we started organize even at the universities in Germany, some courses for the occasion, for progress, for professional progress. So we make a course in Bonn. We make a course in Berlin. We make a course in Munich. We make a course in Marburg on the Lahn. It was in Frankfurt also some courses. Some from time to time there were a group of twenty, thirty people who can afford it, who are going only for education there. And that was the reason. And so I went with this group there. And I went to Bonn where I stayed for three months there. And I make my, my graduation doctor there in Bonn and then Marburg. That was the two universities. Marburg was a general university and Bonn was only a dental school. So here we got a dental license as a dental practitioner license and here you make your doctor up in Marburg. So you are a doctor and a dentist, both of it."

Even we knew that some of them were with a Nazi past. The more Nazi they were before the war or during the war, the more forthcoming they were after the war. They didn\u2019t know, they said, about anything what happened before. And they were always good with Jews and they had good relations and even there at the university there were professors Jews and so forth. In Bonn, for example, the head of the school was Professor Kirkhaus, which was known that he was a member of the Nazi party. 34 And he was the first one who quit the Jewish professor who was there.

            "answer": "I can hardly say that you were angry, because nobody forced you to go. You have to, to have your attitude, you come there, you have to accept the reality. Of course, you knew exactly that you are stepping on the burning ground. You know this is not the place where you should be. But it is not only there. You start to think with the real terms even then already. This is the reality of life and this is the future of life. If you want to separate and if you want to be somebody else, chosen for something. There is no place for you on this world. You have to accommodate it to the future life. And this is the future life. This is the future. Now you see what happens. Israel has relations with Germany, with France. However we know there are still a lot of anti-Semites. And they are everywhere. They are everywhere. But they are not because they are special anti-Semites. There are anti-blacks, there are anti-yellows, there are anti-Asians, there are anti, all kinds of antis. This is the reality of the world now. You know, it sometimes is for me difficult to accept the general view of the Jewish world about the Polish anti-Semites, about Poland. I born in Poland. I got my education in Poland. I lived there. And I was a Polish patriot. And so were many, the majority. There were some Jews which didn\u2019t accept never that they are Poles. And to say that the Poles were all anti-Semites, I will not put this category, put them in this category. There were some interests. And people are behaving very often, very different in different situations. But to say a priori all the Polish are anti-Semites, it is exaggerated. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not true. But the same you can say about Jews. They are anti- Arabs, they are anti-Poles or anti-this. There are Jews who are anti-Jewish. Everything exists. But mainly I don\u2019t know how to categorize it, even with my most sophisticated thinking, I think in every human body there is some anti, some anti. Anti- this, anti-him, anti, is it anti-blacks or some blacks? Or anti-yellows or just some yellows? Anti-Asians. There is in every human being, there is an anti. But you have to come to some point that you are living in this world, which 1s very differentiated and if you will not accept this, there is no place for you. Because every day brings surprises. We are not done with wars. We are not done with discriminations. It was, it is and it will be forever, forever."

            "answer": "Well, this question is a very sensitive question. When you came to Israel, how difficult it 1s to say, there was a gap between these born Israelis, long living in Israel and newcomers in Israel. Like everywhere, a stranger gets feeling of a stranger. You are a stranger for a while until you are not accommodating to the reality. And then some gap, some gap, it is sixty years after establishment of Israel state, fifty-two years, but there\u2019s still differences between born Israelis, longest living Israelis and new coming Israelis. Is it good? It is reality. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Maybe it is human nature. It\u2019s this kind of jealousy. But in the beginning when you came in, the feeling was a little bit different, because a lot of people in Israel, living in Israel, not born in Israel, but living in Israel for many years, who were the elite in Israel, came from Poland, Russia, maybe Czechoslovakia. Some came from Germany, too. Zionists. They felt the elite, 35 and you felt when you came in with a feeling how could you survive? You must have done something which 1s not right, that you could survive the Holocaust. Because my parents, my uncle, my grandparents, my brother, my sister, they were killed. Everybody. Nobody is here. And you survive. You must be guilt of something. You have to feel this guilt."

And they had to communicate in other language, which was in Yiddish or in German, and the Israeli-born children didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. They didn\u2019t want to speak Yiddish. I think they\u2019re quite chauvinistic. I think they are quite chauvinistic. And the same thing can be said about the long living in Israel. They were maybe not so chauvinistic as they were the best one, the good one. \u201cWe came here and we built this country. We fought for this country and we gave us acountry.\u201d You know, that was also a very strange feeling. A very strange feeling.

            "answer": "It\u2019s not only me, but usually people are always closer to their landsmen. Coming from Poland, get with the Polish people. Coming from Hungary, are living with the Hungarians because of the language. I cannot say. We had people from different, from Hungary, from Romania, from Czechoslovakia, from Germany. And in reality, the most educated people which we met in Israel, which were the leading intelligentsia in Israel, they were original from these countries. From Germany, coming from Germany. Because the aliyah which came to Israel from the Arab countries, they were merchandise mostly. Very, very, very few which were professionals. They all business men, all handy people, making something for a living. But in general, there were the poor people who came, that were the first who came into Israel. That was the big problem. They didn\u2019t have the language and they didn\u2019t have the... for them life was very difficult when they came poor. So there was difficult for apartment. They built temporary shelters for them. And they were living in these shelters for several years until they somehow came out there. There are some of them living until today. Some of them built houses on the places where the shelter houses were. They allowed them to build, so they gave them... because most of the land were belonging to the Keren Kayemeth. So they allowed them, these people to settle on this places because the government wasn\u2019t able to give them stable living. So there are some slobs until today and there are some which built nice houses. And of course, with the time, the new generation there went to school and they make progress. And a lot of them came with their religious leaders, with their Rabbis. And then they settled in their own circles. And this is now Israel\u2019s greatest problem, is their religious Orthodox problem. With the Sephardic, Sephardic those are those, Sephardic in reality means the Spanish people. They don\u2019t have nothing to do with Spanish, except maybe their ancestors came from Spain. But generally they are Arabic Jews and they learn quite fast, Hebrew. And they arrange their life very nice. And they make terrible progress, very, very nice progress. But the problem of Israel is not solved and will never be solved in my opinion. That\u2019s war... my son, for example, was in two big wars, in the Six- Day War and the Yom Kippur War. And that was one of the main reasons that he left Israel. He said he had enough of wars, when he came to the United States for studying his business, so he found that he would be better here. And he stayed here. And therefore we are here. We came after him, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be here in the United States. I would be here in Israel until today. And I\u2019m not sorry that I did it, because I\u2019m not sorry of one step in my life. I don\u2019t look backwards. I take the reality. Iam here happy. I live happy. And so is my son. I have two grandchildren. My granddaughter graduated now from the University here in Kentucky. But she lives also to Austin, Texas, where my son lives. And our grandson is in Virginia Beach. So now we are without children and without grandchildren, but we have here very good friends. And we are happy here, making our life here."

But usually it was a barrier for her. But we have a society where she could speak Polish, where she could speak German. And we had very wonderful company, very good friends. And then concerning our son, it came when he went to school, to elementary school. He asked in the first grade, he asked about whether we could help him with something in his homework. And mother told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but go to Father because I don\u2019t know.\u201d So he ask a very simple question, \u201cMom, did you ever go in your life to school?\u201d So it is difficult to say that we spoke with him about the Holocaust because it was a painful thing to go on to put it on your children. But of course when he growed up, when he went to high school and later on to military, he realized what happened and he asked some questions. But not too many, not too many, not too many. And I think until we came here, to the United States, he learned more about all of this than all his staying in Israel."

But from what you\u2019re saying it sounds as if there was not very much talk about the Holocaust.",
            "answer": "You are right. In the first maybe ten years there was no talk about the Holocaust. Later on bit by bit it came out and they start to open more the world and exchange of knowledge of the world, with all other countries in Europe and the United States. And the Jews from the United States, tourists used to come, family members looking, searching for family and some of them finding. And there was always exposed to the Israeli informations in the papers and everywhere that was always the corner, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to find families, far families and families and friends from shtetl. Here they found a sister, here they found a brother after not knowing that they survived, because they disappeared and they went to different corners of the world, to Australia or to New Zealand and to Africa and wherever you want, you have everywhere people in the world. So when they start to come somehow together it was more exposed in the reality of course, with this knowledge it came always a history and development of knowledge about Holocaust, how it came to it, and this opened the door to more knowledge about the Holocaust."

            "answer": "My personal life was never involved with any Arabs. With any Arabs, I didn\u2019t know. Well, I can say that I knew nothing, but from the press and visiting to go to the South to Beersheba and passing some villages where Arabs was living going to Nazareth. If you go to see the country, you met the Arabs and their way of living. But in my place where I lived there was no Arabs at all. At that given time there was no Arabs. In Tel Aviv, for example, there was a section which was Jaffa, the port of Jaffa, the old port of Jaffa is the oldest port in the Mediterranean. There are living Arabs until today. The majority of them are Arabs and they are Christian Arabs and there are Muslim Arabs. There are churches, there are mosques. So when you are going to Tel Aviv, because there is not separation between Tel Aviv and Givataim, Givataim was on the rand (ph) of Tel Aviv, that\u2019s like a suburb of Tel Aviv. And then when you want to go for a good meal, you went to Jaffa there. Good restaurants. Were Arab restaurants. And Oriental Jews opened oriental restaurants. So this is the way where you came together with the Arab world. You want to go to buy some fresh fish in the harbor there. So you could buy it at Arab fishers there. There were Jewish fishers, too. But generally we didn\u2019t have any, any, any connection and live together with the Arabs. We knew from the press and we knew from the medias how they live and where they live and what their problems are, but we didn\u2019t have nothing in common, nothing in common. You came to Jerusalem, of course, after the Liberation, I mean after the Six-Day War there, western part of Israel, or Jerusalem which they annected. So you learned something. When you came to Jerusalem before when it was divided, you came always to the gate, where we saw the Arabs here. It was always a danger to approach close because there were shootings."

We met them and became friendly, very friendly. They really embraced us and they asked us to come to Poland, to be their guests there. And to see, you will see it is not so bad. Just try, come and you will see your sights. That was one thing. The other thing was we wanted to see our savior, this Muschau, who got his righteous papers there, and his family. We wanted to see him because he was older than we are and we wanted to see him alive still. We supported him from Israel. We were sending parcels and money from time to time. And we supported him and he was very 39 thankful. They were not rich people, very poor peasants. And he also wrote us that he will be happy to see us. So we decided we will go, we will see how it is. We went there and as I told you maybe before, I was a member of Rotary International in Israel and I became a member of Rotary here in Lexington, too. And as a Rotarian you are obliged to visit a club wherever you go. You should go to meet. Rotary have to come together, whoever it is. The Rotary in principle, Rotary has to have the best people. That\u2019s what the principle of Rotary is. And we went there to see Rotary in Krakow on their meeting. And one of the members was a Jesuit priest, who was a professor at the University there. And he was a doctor of biology and a doctor of philosophy. A very bright person. After I had my speech there, at Rotary they are always asking guest Rotarian to give his impression and his greetings from his club to bring there. He came to me, and we became very friendly, very friendly. So that even when I came back to the United States, we were writing to each other. I have maybe fifty letters from him, which he wrote to me and I wrote to him exchanging of some ideas. He was very fond of the Jewish religion and of Judaism. Which I, I have studied a lot about Judaism, biblical Judaism and Talmudic Judaism. So I could give him some answers. We had some very, very interesting talks about this subject. We had a very good time there. We went there to the village. One of our Polish friends which we became friendly, he visited here with the University of Kentucky for a year. We became friendly and he invited to visit him in Krakow. And he went with his car with us to these villages where we used to be in hiding there. And we went there and met the people. There was a very exciting experience. And we really enjoyed to see this everything from perspective, it gives us some good feeling that we could do it.

And there is the oldest synagogue in Europe, called before the world the Alte Shul. And there is now a Jewish museum. There is another thing there on this street, which is one of the oldest, maybe oldest too, maybe in the same time. I don\u2019t know exactly. The Remu Shul, the shul which is named after Reb Isserls, which was a Rabbi in Krakow in the, I guess it was in the fifteenth century if I am not wrong. There is still a shul and there are still Jews coming and there is a minyan and praying in Shabbas. And they\u2019re of course coming curious. And there is always a meeting of Jews who come visit Krakow. They are always coming there. And the site of this shul is the old cemetery which a gravestone of this famous Rabbi, Rabbi Isserls. They called the shul and they called the Rabbi \u201cRemu\u2019. Rabbi Moshe Isserls. About him, used to say, \u201cFrom Moses, to Moses was not like Moses Isserls.\u201d Was a very great Rabbi, who corrected one of the main Jewish religious books, the Shulchan Aruch, on which the Jews, the Western Jews were living their daily life. That was included every point of life from the Jews. But I will go back to the museum. There are remnants from Jews in Krakow. There were several severed Torahs, Bibles, and all kind of religious utilities. And last but not least, there are many photos of old Jewish life in Krakow. And we were there for a Shabbat prayer at the Remu Synagogue which I mentioned before. And there were a minyan, there were even a group of young students from Canada came to visit Poland and they were visiting this shul and sitting all the pray and praying. And another thing which is to see of Jewish life, there is a Jewish cultural center on the Meilzel (ph) Street. A foundation of Canadian Jew, a , and there are also kind of all Jewish life in the past and the present Jewish life. And they are cultural meetings. There are coming writers and meeting there and presenting their books. And there are Jewish books there in this unit there."

            "question": "Did seeing all of this inspire you at all to, to think about the possibility of Jewish life continuing in Poland? Did you ever consider living there yourself again?",
            "answer": "To answer this question 1s not easy. From a historical point of view I\u2019m sure Jews will live in Poland. First of all because of the root, of the roots. It may be even second, third, fourth and fifth generation, they have their Jewish ballast, if you want to say, which asks them to go back to the sources. This is one thing. The second thing 1s, of the globalization of the world. The world is globalizing. It has united Europe. In another few years if it will continue this way there will no be borders between European countries. It will be a united Europe and Jews are living in Europe and will live in Europe. We have the best example, Spain. The Jews were driven in the fifteenth century from Spain and there are Jews living there. There is a Jewish life in Spain. And there will be everywhere. There is Jewish life in Germany. We may not like it. We may not want it. But life is stronger than all our views. May it be political, philosophical, whatever it is, life has his right. Bread is easier. Where life is easier, people will always go. And that\u2019s my view. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But I am sure and I know that the last visit of the Pope in Israel gives a great contribution to somehow living together, Catholics and Jews. It is maybe ironic that in general even in the United States, people, Jewish people in general are more 42 involved in general Christianity, maybe less in Catholic. Because there is a minority of Catholics. But Poland is ninety percent Catholics. And the Pope, his origin is Wadowice in Poland. And he was during the war behaving as a fellow Semite. And he now with his visit in Israel and his approach to the problem of Jewish\u2014Christian connection, I think opens more the door for Jews to go back to Poland. Maybe I am wrong, maybe I am right. It is still a stereotype of American Jews which have a guilty feeling that they didn\u2019t do nothing, nothing in time of the Holocaust to help their brothers. That they are putting all the guilt of the Holocaust on Polish people. I know the truth is that the majority of extermination, gas chambers and so forth was in the Polish territory. But I find my very answer, I think the main reason is that it was much easier for the Germans to make it where the biggest concentration of the Jews were. There was, in Poland was more Jews than all over the world. So instead to go to Holland or to go to Belgium or to go to Germany, of course they didn\u2019t want to take them because they were ashamed to bring the Jews to Germany. So I mean to this other little countries, to bring million of Jews it was for them impossible. Impossible. Physically it was impossible. Maybe it would be good if they had come to this idea. But their idea was to do this fast, fast and more able to do it was in Poland That\u2019s my opinion. Maybe I am wrong, but that is the reason. And of course, there is something to it that in Poland were no many objection to it. But there is another answer, Poland was the biggest country of this all occupied territories except France. But France has its own Anti-Semitic history, so we can put it in another perspective."

She is not clean, that means when she has her menstruation. Only after she goes, she has menstruation, after she finished and take a ritual bath, she is clean. And she is even with everybody. I don\u2019t say she is not even, I don\u2019t say this is a dirtiness or an illness, but it\u2019s against the teachings of our sages. And if you go on to take off barriers one by one, officially as permissible, you take the balance off Jewish religion. One of the two. You want to be Jewish you have to follow the teachings. Even when you don\u2019t follow, but you don\u2019t have to revolutionize it. That what I think. Iam not kosher, for example. I am not doing a lot of things. I am riding on Shabbat.

If they invited me to the Temple when there was Remembrance Day, they were asking me to light a candle. That was all. And they were making some prayers.

I don\u2019t know. But even when it is written, even when they read about it, I think, in my opinion, they have an opportunity to hear it from the first source. They should ask to hear of it, they should. But I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t. Very ignorant, very ignorant. And then they are not interested. The people, the few people who survive, they are not interested, because they know the same, they have their opinion.

You know, each community tries to make a museum, a Holocaust museum, which in itself is maybe a nice deed. But who will come to this museum? I think the Holocaust museum which is in Washington is the one which was a necessity, very important. And it fills all the spectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before the war, in the war and after the war. Maybe there are some nuances which come out which are not of value. But to make so many, I think people will not be interested to go to the main museum where they have everything. And this happens because of the way how Jewish society is built in the United States. It has to be a society, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice-president, it has to be a secretary, it has to be members of the board and so forth and so forth. Maybe in itself it is as a social thing, maybe it is good, maybe. But I think a majority of the raised funds goes to administrative use, the paperwork and to expenses which are not profit of the social needs of people who really needs the help. That is what I think. And about commercializing the Holocaust, I think when you take thousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these thousands you will make one book which includes everything. So there is no need, in my opinion, for so many editions, for so many work with it in... I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. Of course, you can see a lot of people who became very famous because of the Holocaust, very famous. But I don\u2019t want to criticize them. I don\u2019t want to criticize nobody.

But it is in the moment, I am ninety years old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life with joy and suffering. It is like one Jewish sage said: \u201cIt is good to be born a Jew. It\u2019s good to die a Jew, but what do you do in the meantime, this is the problem.\u201d From the beginning until the end, the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life, which many other religion or communities don\u2019t have. Not because they wanted, but the wind of history put the Jews in the center of cultural life. Even in the world. Not only in Germany, not only in Poland or in Russia or in Palestine or Spain or in the United States. Everywhere where the Jews were the center of civilized life, of cultural life was concentrated in the Jewish communities or singles. Jewish Nobel Prize winners, there were scientists in the United States in medical field, in general science are not compatible to no one other people. Maybe this is the reason that the jealousy of other people brings them to hatred. I cannot wish that the Jews wouldn\u2019t concentrate of all this progress and culture and civilization. A country they have to do everything possible what brings progress to the world. But I am turning to the other point not to cover this with egocentric religious or national use. To take it more in human general perspective and civilized ways. This is my advice and this is my way of thinking. And that, and we will remember this, this can maybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with other nations in civilized world. That we will not be scapegoats in any way, which we were during all our history from the beginning until today. To avoid it, listen what I said. Thank you."
