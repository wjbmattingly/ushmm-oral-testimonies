There was alr eady third or fourth generation there and there was no potential Rabbi which could, which could affinate (ph) my father there. My father used to go to Sans (ph) , which was quite a distance, about fifty miles. To go for holidays there to the Rabbi of Sans (ph) . Also sometimes OfBobof (ph) , which is also a little shtetl there in the surroundings of Sans (ph) .

Interesting enough, our sister, she married a very interesting man, who was, in the beginning he was a teacher in our house, teaching us the religious ways.

Both of them survived the Holocaust. The one married in the war and had a daughter in the war. And she escaped, run away, being pregnant from Debica, I mean this village there, to Lvov, which was in the Ukraine. Then it was belonged to Poland, but the Russian invaded this part of the country, of Polish country. And she, when she saw the disaster in the ghetto, she put her child under a convent\u2122s door. And was looking from far away what happened to this child. And she saw that a nun came out and she took in the child in the house. And then she ra n away and she became a se rvant, as a Polish girl, as a Gentile at the head of the Gestapo in Lvov. That was the older one. The younger one had a friend in Lvov. She was in Lvov studying sewing, to be a seamstering. Mother, very good seamster, which she was. And she met there a bo y, before the war he was leader already of the trade unions. And when the Russian came in\u2013 in the beginning he was a very big shot. But when the Russians, when the German invaded, he went with the Russian back to Russia and there he joined the Polish Army, which was orga nized there by the Poles after their agreement, the Polish agreement in exile with the Russians, which allowed them to organize their Army, which was affiliated to the Russian Army. And they were fighting. And he was fighting the Germans until Berlin. And he put her on a Polish fa mily. She was a seamster and she gave bir th USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 4 4to a daughter, but that was already in 1945 when the war is going to end. When he came from Russia to Poland with the invasion, I mean to fight with the Russian Army. And then she gave birth to this daughter. And when the war was co ming to an end, he became a governor of a part which was annected from Poland from the German territory there. And he took her there, and they had another two sons, but they not living as Jews. And they very talented boys. And when it came in Poland the time where Jews moved from Poland to Israel in 1965 I guess, was it? Something like this. They came, first time she told the sons that they are Jewish and they were already both matriculated afte r high school diploma. And on e of them was already studying engineering. And they came to Israel. But thei r father, himself, he in the meantime, being a governor he studied at the university at the same time to become an agronom\u2013 agronomy. And he came to Israel as an agronom. But because Israel didn\u2122t have confidence to all these apparatchiks from Poland. I mean all this comm unist active parties, he couldn\u2122t find a job. It was very difficult to find. And we were already at this time in Israel and I had some connection with people and to a member of the Israel Par liament. And I wrote to them and I warranted about him, that he\u2122s not one of the Russian serv ices and he got a job in agronomy. But he passed away about six or seven years ago. In the meantime, the older son is working in a very high, secret Israel Army factory. And the other son was also an engineer, but in the same time he was teaching in a school, in a vocational school. And ma rried a girl from Venezuela. And one year ago they decided that they leave Israel and they came to the United States. And he got a job here in California. He must be very, very important engineer, because he got the, he made the green card and he can work and they bought a house. But they have one son, who is at the Israel Army. And just now I heard, two w eeks ago, he went to Israel and asked to give him some off in the Army. And he came to visit him here to the Un ited States. He will not stay. He will go back to Israel. But he decided, his wife and with th e other two children to stay in the United States."

I will not deny there was not in Poland anti-Semitism. But you know anti-Semitism until today has many faces. There is an economic anti-Semitism, there is a political anti-Semitism and there is a racist antiSemitism. And for me and my observance, my conviction, I think if I analyze the Jewish situation in Poland, it was more economic antiSemitism, with some reasons, objective reasons. They were nobody\u2122s fault, but the situation became so that this anti-Semitism has his logica l reasons, logical reasons, maybe it shouldn\u2122t be, maybe it is nobody\u2122s fault, but it was. I cannot say there was a racial anti-Semitism. Well, there is in every nation, there are some extreme people, which they can get\u2013 and they are more doing it for personal reasons and for gaining something of it. And this is also the political anti-Semitism, which is to gain something to rule over people. You know? And Jews were more educated, absolutely more educated than the common people in Poland. Because as I told you before, I started to study when I was three. You know, and this gives, whatever you study, it gives you more advance about people which are just starting to study something at the age of eight or nine or ten even. Some of them didn\u2122t go to school, the Polish people didn\u2122t go to school ever. There was illiteracy, too. So, when it came to elections, the Jews, they knew what they wanted. And the masses didn\u2122t know. Maybe it is until today a lot of masses don\u2122t know when they are going to vote, what they need and what they want. It is until today everywhere. But especially in a country like Poland, which wa s, which wasn\u2122t so educated. There was a lot of people who didn\u2122t have, it was only by propaganda, which was from mouth to mouth, from promises and so forth, you know. And then Pola nd, I would need to go into the situation of Poland, how Poland became free after be ing occupied by three countries."

Education, knowledge and education, that was, is and that would always be the point. And this gave also the impulse for political views and fo r a kind of organized anti-Semitism, which for the Jews, for the victims, it is not important what kind of anti-Semitism it is.

You have so many things to do that you don\u2122t have the time to play these games. But, but, the officers, the Polish officers generally, generally, were anti-Semites. What kind? They were so educated, they were so prepared. That was the elite. That they, but of course, they didn\u2122t, they didn\u2122t want to show up as anti-Semite s. But you could feel it, you could feel it. Not everybody felt it. And then like I said, the poorer Jews went to the Army because they were not able to pay to get free from the Army, not to serv e. The rich Jews who didn\u2122t want to go to the Army, there was always finding a way of bribery. To whom? To the Polish officers, to the Polish doctors, to the Polish secretaries, so that they made themselves sick and they write and they are sick and they cannot serve. And so the poor and little Jews were serving in the Army. There were no too many of the intelligentsia wh ich was serving in the Army. And then there was another thing. After matriculation you are going to the officer\u2122s school. And in the officer\u2122s school, they didn\u2122t want the Jews to become officers. They were there because they were, after matriculation that was the law. So usually th ey find always a way to send them back to the normal Army, not to live in the school to beco me an officer. There were officers, Jewish officers, but very few, very few. It was difficult to advance, to be a Jew and to be an officer, a high officer in the Polish Army. There were high er officers only medical officers, because they needed them. They have to take them and that\u2122s what it was."

And they choose Easter, 1943, yeah? 1943 they choose to go to make an acti on and to arrest these Polish people who are in the underground.

He was a student of law, of the thir d year, second or third year. He was the commandant of this unit there in this region. And there was other, there was a teacher and there was several people.

But in the church he was preaching the Polish people to support Polish people, to buy at Polish people, but most of the businesses were Jewish. And therefore Jews were calling all of this kind of expression, they were calling anti-Semite. That was economical anti-Semitism. They want to support their own people. I don\u2122t find it wrong. I don\u2122t find it wrong. I think he as a priest has an obligation to his people. How we didn\u2122t like it, how we didn\u2122t want it, but still it did hurt us economically. But he, as a human being and as a priest, he told us, \ufb01I want to help you because it comes a ba d time to you.\ufb02 So I cannot say he is a racist or he is a political anti-Semite. He was economical anti-Semite. He was anti-Semite. We are very sensitive. We Jews are very sensitive, but we have the reason why to be sensitive after thousands of years of discrimination. But still, if you have a little bit brain and you want to understand human nature, you can find some objective reasons why some people are behaving so, and not like you would like they will behave. We would like to be taken care on us as the Chosen People. But we are not the chosen, to take care on us. We are chosen because we have obligations. We choose to have the obligations. This is the chosen. We took the Ten Commandments, we took the Torah, we took everythi ng, but we have to perform it. And if there is, you have to love your neighbor as yourself. You can never love like yourself, it is allegoric. But you don\u2122t have to harm your neighbor. You have to behave. And that, which in many cases we are missing. Even in the holy books we sometimes mention, \ufb01We are the Chosen People. You can do to other people this and this and this. You can take interest by non-Jews. You can do this, you can do this, but not to your brothers.\ufb02 And that was a segregation which was in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 10 10Torah. There is segregation which we choose to make the segregation. This is the Chosen People, not only in the positive sense, a lot of th ings is negative. And therefore a lot of people who are open-minded, they are taking the teachings of our fathers, not strictly verbally. You make some selection. You have some humanitari an obligations as a human being, not blind to follow scriptures, but you have to find a way how to live with people, how to respect other people. Which is very, very important. How do you respect others, so others will respect you? And this is my conviction which I came after so many years of life a nd so many readings and studying of all, all this which is written in the Jewish and in the non-Jewish books and teachings. Well it\u2122s not a\u2013 if you know __________, introduction, but I mean you have to know to whom you are speaking.

You were, you were, you told the story in the first interview about how you went away to the Russian front. You tried to join the Army, you kind of got caught underneath the Russian occupation and then you made your way back to your home village of Brzeznica? Is that right? And then I\u2122m a little bit confused. You mentioned that you were working in an S, were you working in an SS camp? Was it a concentration camp for Jews that you were working in?

            "answer": "No, never. That was one of the miracles of this war maybe. There were no many Jews who are allowed to go in the camp and to leave the camp. And that was, by some miracle, maybe the reason was the German discipline, which they foll owed the orders of the Commandants, of the F\u00fchrers. When I came to this camp, I volunteer ed. That was a working camp and therefore I was put into this camp as a dentist. There wa s no big dentistry and there was no big medicine, but still there was three medical doctors and there was rooms with beds, which in the beginning, which people when they got sick, even beaten when they were, they could come to the doctor. And they get care, they get care. In the beginning, even some times they were released from this to go to the town, to the little shtetl close to Debica there. There was other assignment to other works. But that was already not in their compet ence. In the beginning, how strange it would be, there was a Colonel, SS, who was the head of this health services there, Obersturmbanf\u00fchrer (ph) Schumacher was his name. And then, but he was maybe for two or three weeks and started only, that was only in \u201a40. That was not yet nothing. That was the first beginning. And therefore the Jews were slowly getting in circulating. They took him so easy, they took him so by easy. They were voluntary, then later by force and later on by annihilation. They were going by themselves. That was the system. And then afte r two or three weeks, he left. But that was an order officer. A lieutenant officer.

And that was the things. There was no other things, no fillings. I had to make fillings only when an SS man didn\u2122t want to go to the SS. They were not allowed to go to a Jewish dentist, not to a Polish even, nor to a German. They had to go to an SS. But they kne w that they will have a special treatment at the Jewish dentist, so some of them came. And th at was a very difficult ta sk, because I didn\u2122t have, I didn\u2122t have this equipment, which the German have. The German has the most modern and the most ___________ equipment. The SS had the most modern. And there was a lot of cases, which I couldn\u2122t treat them at all, and I send them to go there. But they were insisting, they were insisting. And so in beginning, th at was about a year. I had an ID, SS ID, that I could come to the camp and I left. The bus was standing, I show only the ID and I left.

He said, \ufb01The Jewish dentist can come to the camp whenever he wants.

And because of they gave me this job, I didn\u2122t belong to the SS, I belong all the time to th e working office. And the head of this working office was a German, he became German. He was a German fr om origin. But he was Polish all the time. Only when the Germans came in, he became a German. And he was an officer in the Polish Army with a German name. Eilmiss (ph) was his name, Jule Eilmiss (ph) . And he was very good to me. I was very good to him. I gave him from time to time, I gave him all kind of bribes. And maybe they respect because I was affiliated to this, maybe this was the reason that I didn\u2122t belong to the SS, I belong to the working. And that was the reason. And when I came to this post and I said, \ufb01I am the Jewish dentist. I need to go to the camp, please give me company.\ufb02 And they give me an SS man, who brought me to the camp. By the entrance to the camp there was another SS man, but he respected this SS man, he gave me over to him. He opened the gate and let me in. And when I was ready, I went to the office and I said, \ufb01I want to go out.\ufb02 They call to the camp, to the post, a nd the postman came and take me out from there. So, this is, everything is miraculous. Well, it is miracle that I am alive and that I am here. But that was something which was really extraordinary.

A mile in Poland is like hundred miles here. Distances are differe nt. And the other Jews were coming to us to study religious things by the teacher which we have in our house. And they were really poor Jews, poor Jews. It is difficult to describe. Well, in the last years, the situation improve . But I remember as a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 14 14child I came in the house of one of the oldest ci tizens in this village that has Haskila Ascheim (ph) . And he had two sons\u2013 three sons, one went to the Austrian Army and later on to the Polish Army, because it was just a change from Po lish liberalization. It was a widow with five children.

Th e other son had also five children and they were very, very talented children, very talented children, but they didn\u2122t have the opportunity to go to school, only to the community school, I mean to the elementary school. But they were ___________, they studied by themselves. And this two sons became even writers and the lawyer in the village there. And one of the s ons became a dentist. And the daughter married. Not that this is the point. The point is that th is three sons with their families, in the beginning there was here two children, here one child, the other one also two children. They were living in one house, where there was only three rooms. Of course no bathroom, nothing like this. In addition, in the big hall, this old Jew had a pub. He was selling alcohol to the Polish people were coming, drinking there. Everythi ng in this one house. Later on they move on, they somehow organize them, their living.

The Russians stopped on the river, they didn\u2122t cross the river Vistula to help the Polish resistance, the Uprising in Poland for political reasons. They want the Poles to be annihilated by the Germans and then will go and kill the Germans. That was a very courageous thing to make from the Russian side. But that was a very, very bad thing instead to help to fight the Germans. The Germans killed a lot of Polish people. And of course, a lot between them the Jewish, which were fighting with the Poles, from the rest wh ich remained there between the Poles. And we have all the news about the uprisings. There was, in the bunker where the commandant, ours, was sitting, they had a radio, which they are listening to Radio London, from London, BBC, they have all the news and the movements of the Ru ssian Army. And I knew in one day they brought to me, two English pilots, who escaped from the camp, from the German camp, and I had to transport them to the Russians, because the United States had air bases in Russia. Because the United States were already allies with the Russians. And I was already, I said already good bye to Fryda and I was already on the way to go.

So I left them at this Polish unit there AK where I brought them there and I came back to Fryda there.

            "answer": "It was a very, very, very mixed feeling. On one side you felt the Russians are coming, you will not be more in danger as a Pole, but as a Jew, you continue to be in danger. And then came the reality. You find out what happened. Because until now, you heared only, they killed here, they killed here, they killed here. But the disaster so big, you realized only slowly when you were liberated. When you came to the big city, Krakow, which has before the war, in the war even, in the beginning, ninety thousand Jews and you barely find five or six people which are Jews. That was a trauma which you couldn\u2122t, you couldn\u2122t hand it. You were, and you were asking by yourself, why me? Why didn\u2122t Anna do what I did? You start to analyze and to understand and those are things that you cannot understand until today. Because there were wiser people than me, speaking Polish better than me or the same like me, having connection with people. Why didn\u2122t they survive? Why didn\u2122t they choose our way? Was it right we did? And what is the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 19 19role we have to play by being alive? Try to orga nize a Jewish life, or forget about it? No Jews, no Jewish life. You are Polish. Go on, be a Pole. And that\u2122s what many Jews do it, did it. And there are until today Jews which are living as Po les. They said, \ufb01Forget about it.\ufb02 But we couldn\u2122t do it. Our roots are too strong. I don\u2122t know. We didn\u2122t know what to do. We didn\u2122t know what to do. We were poor like mices. We had to look, to find something to eat, not to speak about finding a way to organize your life, to start to be a human being. You are out of it, you are no human anymore. You start to re alize you live surrounded in animosity. And you look for some Jews. And I found some. I remember the first night we didn\u2122t have where to go. No home. But somehow we met somebody. I don\u2122 t remember. I think I knew these people or recognize them as Jews. And I did ask him, \ufb01Who else is here?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Come with me.\ufb02 And I went with him, or with her better. And we came in a dark room and there were already several Jewish people, survivors from all kinds of surviving. And we sit there in this room, in this dark room and started to sing Jewish songs, Yiddish songs, very nostalgical Jewish songs. All the Yiddish songs were sad, all were sad. But in this moment, they were healing. They were like Balsam on a wound. Remembrance for a moment , your heritage. And we passed this night, I don\u2122t remember, on songs and somehow sleeping s itting on a broken couch. All together there were maybe six, seven people. And each one with his song, not with story. We didn\u2122t talk yet about story. We, somehow, I don\u2122t know how to explain it. Is it shame or is it\u2013 I don\u2122t know. But we are here. We left everything behind and we are sitting here. Nostalgia, remembering Yiddish songs. Don\u2122t think even what to do, where to go farther. But we woke up in the morning, woke up. We didn\u2122t take our work clot hes. We were in the clothes which we had, these poor clothes. We find out from one of them that one of my friends survived. Where is he? Who is it? He was before the war, he was a lady beautician parlor. Father was a barber, and he had a nice sister. And I used to come to their ho use before the war. And he survived on papers. But he was already in the Russian intelligence. Polish uniform, the Russian intelligence. And somehow I met him. I don\u2122t remember exactly how. And I asked him, \ufb01What is to do. Where to go? I don\u2122t have a house. I don\u2122t know where to go.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I got back my apartment.\ufb02 There are two bedrooms, a kitchen on the third floor in the _______________ Jewish section. But he says, \ufb01You can go there. And somehow we will find there some way to sleep.\ufb02 But there were already some people in, which survived Auschwitz. That was a girl, a boy, and another girl. And then came other people. I don\u2122t know who this were. We all were there, but we didn\u2122t have a bed to sleep. We slept on the floor. And I decided, we decided to look around, and we went to my village. To this older woman, who t ook us on. And she fed us, she gave us to eat. And we left in their house some of our clothes, so me of our furnishes. And she was already, she, not her son, who lived nearby\u2013 because my mother, my grandmother, my brother\u2122s sister lived in her house and I lived in the son\u2122s house. There I make a little clinic there in his house. And we went there to sleep in the night in his house. In the night, somebody was knocking at the door and the window. And there\u2122s, in Russian, \ufb01Kroy (ph) ! Open! You have here Jews!\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I don\u2122t have Jews. They are Polish people like you, like we.\ufb02 They came in. He opened, because this was soldiers which were in the camp, where there was once a camp. There was a field hospital for wounded Russian soldiers. And this were wounded soldiers which were there in this, but they were strong enough to go in between the Poles and to make connections with them. And I understand, I am not sure, I am nine ty-nine percent sure. They went to the rich Poles where we left a lot of things and he told th em to go there, the Jews came here. You have to kill them, very simple. And for them to kill a Jew is like kill a German. They like a soldier, especially a wounded soldier, a front soldier. And they came in and said, \ufb01Are you Jewish?\ufb02 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 20 20And I understand Ukrainian, too, because in the Polish Army where I served there were mostly Ukrainians there. I said, \ufb01There\u2122s no Jews here.\ufb02 \ufb01Who are you?\ufb02 We had the papers. Said, \ufb01We are here, only sleeping here. We are Polish.\ufb02 Well, okay, they left. They went to the house of the mother, the mother\u2122s house and they the same. \ufb01Where are the Jews here?\ufb02 \ufb01There are no Jews.\ufb02 They gave some shots in the air and they left. In the morning we said to the son of our, we told him to help us to move. We want to move back to Krakow. But there was no communication, there was no train. And I want to take some of this furniture to have something to sleep. So, he took the horse of his mother and the other horse from a neighbor and a wagon and we started to move to Krakow. That is about sixty miles from, hundred kilometers, hundred ten kilometers, something like this."

            "answer": "It was 22 nd, no 25th of January, 1945, after the Russians came in. We start there the way to Krakow. It is not describable the conditions. We had to take food for the horses first because you couldn\u2122t buy this. Nobody would sell it. The m oney didn\u2122t have any value anymore. And the horses, if you don\u2122t feed them, they will not go. And you have to have the food on the way back, too. So the most of the wagon was food. And we took also some of the furniture which we left there and some of clothings we left th ere, also. They took it out from the ground, they dig it out. And they give us back everything, everything. They were very honest people. On the way my wife was more dead than alive. She wa s fainting and I had to do, to work on her. And by the way we were going around way, it was a longer way but more secure. _____________, where the army wasn\u2122t going. I knew the Polish geography very well. I know how I will get to Krakow by longer, around ways. We came to an ort (ph), which was called Zakroczym. First of all we passed a place which is called Tochow (ph) . At Tochow there used to live a sister of my mother, with her family. Her husband, her daughter with her husband. I don\u2122t know how many children she had in the meantime. And the sons all run away to Russia, and they survived in Russia. The husband too, the old husband, too. But he died in Siberia, in Russia. They all were sent to Siberia to Infada (ph) , to Sever (ph) , to Jakutz (ph) , or Jakutzia (ph). That was where they banished all the criminals in the older countr y revolutions there. With all the history there, there were trees which ten people have to surround it. Such a tree, such forest. And they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 21 21brought them there and they said to them, \ufb01Here you have to liv e.\ufb02 No houses. Their houses were from snow, and their windows were from ice. And they had to work there, but all right that\u2122s about them. That\u2122s another story. But I came to this Tochow. And I did ask the Polish people there because no Jew was there, \ufb01What happe ns?\ufb02 They said, \ufb01All were killed and some remained they were sent to the ghetto at Tarnow.\ufb02 That was the end. No one Jew was there. No one Jew. So I continued to the next shtetl which was Zakroczym. And of c ourse we have to feed the horses. And we want to come down to move a little bit like I say to y ou, to try if we can go. We were sitting on the wagon all the time. A nd this poor Polish guy, this Soltys Stanislaw was with us, he was the foreman. And while we wanted to come down, Fryda fell down on the ground, fainted again. I save her. I put her on the ground laying down, make some exercises with her. Put her on the wagon back, she faint again several times. And when we fed the horses, we went to continue to go. But the night approach and in the night you couldn\u2122t, you are not allowed because it is curfew. The Russians didn\u2122t joke. Whom they found on the street they killed. So, I went to the first Polish house there where there was a little bit space\u2013 End of Tape 2, Side B USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 22 22Tape 3, Side A"

She is dead already. Better one to put in the grave, like she is looking.\ufb02 But I took, outside I found a brick, an old brick. I put it, make a fire and warm up the brick and I warm up a little bit. And so at th is house, on the floor, we slept through until the morning. In the morning we start to go, and we we nt and we came to Krakow. We went to this house of our friend there and we put what we have, these little furnishes on the dirt floor. This guy helped us, Stanislaw Soltys helped us. And he went back with the horses, back to his home, he had to give back the horse to the neighbor. That was sacrificing. I don\u2122t know how he did it or why he did it. It was not human, that was ange l work. In this time to go back, to endanger the horses, which is all what the people have, a horse, a cart, but he did it. And she gave us a little products, half a bread, which was the big peasant br eads, and some beans, some barley, and we\u2122ll have something to cook and to eat. That was our food at the beginning. And so we are being there with all this people around us, other people living there. And Fryda went to the house, which was their house before the war, their apartment. And there was the janitor of the house, which was the janitor before the war. He was a carpenter working in their furniture store. A dirty, drunk man. And she said to him, \ufb01Maybe ther e will come some post here on this address. We are here living\u2013\ufb02 and she gave the address where we are living. And he, \ufb01And what will be if I bring you a post from your father?\ufb02 And sh e says, \ufb01Well, you will get a hug and a kiss.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01All right.\ufb02 A few days later he came w ith a card, post card from Auschwitz. And he said, \ufb01Pana Fryda (ph) , Miss Fryda, I get a kiss.\ufb02 And she give him a kiss and a hug. \ufb01I got post card from your father.\ufb02 And we have this post card. You saw it I guess. And he is sick and he asks to come to pick him up. In the meantime, I me t another acquaintance of me. He had a dental office, quite a primitive office, but a dental offi ce in an apartment which wasn\u2122t his. It did belong to a Jewish woman before the war. She was even the owner of the house. And she and her daughter survived. But in this moment, she wa sn\u2122t there yet. She was in a camp somewhere. And I met him and I said to him, \ufb01What are you doi ng?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Well I have here a dental office. But I\u2122m leaving this office. I want to sell it because I am leaving to the once German territory. There I will organize a modern dental office, an apartment and I will be living there.\ufb02 He married, he survived as a partisan. He married a Polish, Gentile woman. And he lived together with her. I guess he had some children w ith her already. But he was, he was a partisan in the Socialistic, not in the AK, in the AL, that was Armia Ludowa. That was the Volks party. And they were more lenient to the Jews. And he was a good fighter. He was a strong guy and he was really fighting there, in this army. And he said, \ufb01My party will help me to organize there.\ufb02 I said to him, \ufb01Sell me your office here, for a begi n, it will be good for me.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I will not sell you. I will rent it to you because maybe I don\u2122t find nothing there. I will come back.\ufb02 Said, Okay. I can\u2122t give you nothing. I don\u2122t have nothing. But for the first money what I will make as a dentist I will send it to you some how.\ufb02 And I start to organize a practice. And I had first of all, a room to sleep, a nice room to sleep with a bed, with a couch, quite a nice room and a nice kitchen. And that was for the moment a wonderful solution. But I started to think, \ufb01If he did it, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 23 23maybe I can do the same. I will go to the German occupied, German-Polish occupied territories, Poland occupies German territories . And there were a lot of dentists and dentist equipment and I will organize my clinic there. And to live th ere.\ufb02 And I went there, but I didn\u2122t find nothing which I would like. So I left Fryda there. We met there another guy, a survivor who was already working for the Polish security, in the Polish security. He wrote a book about it. He lives here in the United States. He became a very rich guy here. And he became an officer. He survived in his village there. However they were trying to kill him from the AK, too. But he survived somehow. And he was in this part which became occupied by the Russians first, the first month there. And the Polish units there sent him to an officer\u2122s school and he became an officer in the Polish security. And then when the Russians move d, he moved with them. He came to Krakow. And he make a lot of, find a lot of Polish people whom, whom he gave over to, handed over to the Polish security. But while the Russians occu pied the German part, they sent him to Wroc aw as an officer there of their security. And then they send him to Lidnice, Lidnitz, where we were. And where I was looking for some dental equipm ent, he was working in his job to look for Germans. And we met. And we make a recogni tion as a Jew and he as a Jew. We didn\u2122t talk too much about it. He said, \ufb01What can I do for you?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01You can help me to find some\u2013\ufb02 He said, he\u2122ll try."

In the beginning we want to go to Germany, because one of my brothers, who lives now in the United States, came to visit us in Poland. He c ouldn\u2122t take us. When he came only for two or three days. And he saw our misery there and he tried to help us what he could. And he said, \ufb01Come in Germany we have apartment. You\u2122ll ma ke a living there for time being. Come there.\ufb02 And we found a way where they were repatria ting German families from Poland to Germany. So there was a woman, she came to our house. She was making all kind of businesses, a Jewish woman from Krakow. And she had the connection how to organize, to join people who want to go to Germany with the German repatriates. We left our apartment. We went to Katowice, which was on the border to Germany. But when we came there, we were there two days, there was no transport going to Germany. They already, the last transport left. And you have to wait another month or two and I couldn\u2122 t wait in Katowice there, so we decided to go back to Krakow there. And in Krakow we stayed there until, I guess it was August, I guess, when we find a connection which somebody make passports with a visa to Costa Rica for five hundred dollar each passport. And the uncle from United States gave us the money and we paid thousand five hundred. But we could get a transit visa through Be lgium, because there was no straight flights. There was no flight at all. You have to go by train to Belgium. And from Belgium you could have gone to a flyer, a ship to Costa Rica. But when we came to Belgium, we remained in Belgium. And we stayed in Belgium for five years."

            "question": "Okay, it\u2122s now May 30, 2000, and we\u2122re continuing our interview with Mr. Oscar Haber. And why don\u2122t we start by going back, you had talked on the last tape about the day of your liberation. And just to remind you, what you had talked about, we were, you talked about how afterwards you had met up with some other Jews and you were singing some old Yiddish songs. And then you described going back to your hometown and then back to Krakow. The thing that I wasn\u2122t sure about, that I didn\u2122t quite understand is, did you immediately leave the town where you were after liberation? And do you remember saying good-bye to the family that you were staying with?",
            "answer": "Well, the question of liberation is one of the mo st difficult time from all the past problems which we had. We were, as I told you, living as Chri stians. And the liberation came. We couldn\u2122t enjoy our liberation or country. It was the greatest shock and the most difficult moment in our lives. That was the liberation. And especially if I want to put it in perspective, the differences between people who survived camps and people w ho lived on so-called Aryan papers was very different. We have two things to overcome. The first is, which we had all the time, that was the fight for existence and how to survive, of course. And the next, when the liberation came was the shock to find the reality. You don\u2122t have where to go. You couldn\u2122t find nobody you know, or anybody of your people. You suddenly find yourself, you cannot stay in the place where you were. We were in a village, not in a town. We were in a village. And if I\u2013 realize it was a hostage village. They were not sympathetic to Je wish survivors. However I survived, not a Jew, but suddenly I felt that I am back a Jew. But I c ouldn\u2122t officially declare it. I had to stay on my Aryan papers. And how to go and where to go? Because to go to my other village where I was born there, I wasn\u2122t sure that I will be accepte d. And I wasn\u2122t sure to go to Krakow, for example, because I didn\u2122t have where to go. Even not where to sleep at night. And you don\u2122t have money. And you don\u2122t have nothing becaus e whatever you had you have already sold out whatever you had. So, that was the most terrible time in all this events which we had, the socalled liberation was the terrible hit of the realit y. You were hit with the reality. Not where to go and not what to do and how to start. Will yo u be accepted as a Jew? You cannot go on and to say you are not a Jew, because really where you go they know you are Jew when you come to the places where I used to live. And to st ay in a strange, foreign surrounding like we were before, so I have to stay like I was all the time, a peasant, a farmer. To watch the horse and the cows. In reality I was a dentist. I want to go ba ck. I didn\u2122t have nothing with me, but I have to go to start to look for our existence. And as I said before already that part, I went to the village where I was born, and then later when they went with us to Krakow, all this trouble I have with Fryda and when I came to Krakow. But the questi on of this liberation, to explain it in a very simple term, that was the greatest shock of ev erything together. But when I came to Krakow, when I started to settle as I said, I have been there, different places, start to organize my life. And with the help of the uncle which came, we we nt to Belgium as I said. And in Belgium we became refugees. We became as one of the United Nations refugees. We registered there and I have my register card as a refugee from the Un ited Nations. And I got the permit because I had a visa only to stay there, transit visa to pass through Belgium. But because I was recognized as a refugee, they gave me time to stay three months th ere. In three months I had to renew my stay in Belgium. And we were under the auspicion of the foreign police, a special department, the etranger (ph), police etranger. And they gave us another stay of three months. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 28 28"

Because his house was on the, on the border. Where the front was standing between the Russians and the Germans and there was heavy fire because there was the Dunajec river. And he was close to this river, not far. So he decided, the frontier between the Germans and the Russians, which was standing about four or five months was very close to this place. And his house was under fire, so he decided to come to his sister place, and while he opened the door, a bullet cut his left hand. And he was bleeding and because he knew that the underground station, sanitary station was in my place, so he decided that the neighbor took him on a wagon and he brought him to me there to gi ve him first help. And I cut him. It was hanging on the skin, this hand. I cut on this and I bind around that he doesn\u2122t bleed out and I went back with him together and brought him to his house. And there I found out a really surgeon doctor was hiding there in the underground army and they brought him to this house. I gave him the anesthesia, whichever it could be a little bit chlorofo rm. But most anesthesia was I gave him alcohol. We had there moonshine, moonsh ine. And he was drinking so he was out of conscious. And this surgeon bind him, all these vein s and arteries. First of all, he cut him a little bit of this arm farther because it was already gangrenous, gangrene, because where I bound it there it started, it is very fast process. He cut it there and bind all the arteries and veins and so he survived. And then I didn\u2122t go more to the pl ace of the sister, but I stayed with him and took care on him all the time. So he survived and he was thankful to me and I was very thankful to him. So it was a very, very good occasion to serve this man, this very nice person."

So here was all the time moving Russian truc ks and armaments and soldiers. That was the only way, with the soldiers for a bottle of vodka, which we could have some commuting to Krakow or to the other villages. It was also very dangerous. They were also not very sympathetic to Jews. Sometimes Fryda stand in the line to get a ride to the village there for some food to these Polish people. So there was standing a lot of people and waiting for this ride. So the Russian driver which was taking said, \ufb01You yes, you can go. You yes, yes.

That was individual soldiers, some of them which were, I don\u2122t know, they were from some other nationality as Russians or Ukrainians or Belorussians or Lithuanians or Latvians. There were all kinds of soldiers there. So that was more individual and then it was also sometimes inspired by some other anti-Semites to go to kill a Jew. The Russians didn\u2122t hesitate to kill a Jew, too. However it came in the Polish Army, which was a Polish unit in the Russian Army. In this unit there were many Jews, I mean for us, many\u2013 five was many. Because we used already without Jews here in th is side, the German side.

But Belgium, which seems to be more sympathetic to the Jewish case\u2013 in Antwerp, where there was quite a number of Jews, when you were looking for an apartment for rent, it was in the windows written, \ufb01Not for foreigners.\ufb02 And that meant not for Jews. In some of the apartments was written exactly what I said, \ufb01No Jews.\ufb02 And I in the meantime learned to speak Flemish, which was the language in Antwerp, because Brussels was more French. But Antwerp was Flandria. That was the the part of\u2013 Belgium has two nations, Valonia and Flandria. The Flandrians were more, more German sympathetic. They were German oriented. Valonians were more French oriented. And Jews which were saved in Belgium, they mostly were more saved in this part which was Valonian. In Flandria there was impossible to survive. We came, rented an apar tment. And still we we re all the time renting there. And that was a nice apartment. We l ove it. And the administrator showed us the apartment and the conditions wher e it was not expensive. It was nice and the place was nice. And when it came to write the lease, he says, \ufb01Yes, but you are not strangers.\ufb02 And we said, \ufb01Yes, we are strangers. We are from Poland.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01But you are not Jews?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Yes, we are Jews.\ufb02 So, \ufb01I am sorry, I have inst ructions from my\u2013 I am not the owner, from the owner, no Jews. I am sorry, no Jews.\ufb02 And that gave me a lot to think about it. Around you see no friends, no friendly, no foreigners, no Jews. So that means there is no place to live here for the Jews. However there is a lot Jews remained th ere and lived there. They didn\u2122t care about it. But I was, I don\u2122t know, personally more sensitive realizing this problem. I said, \ufb01No, I don\u2122t want to be, that can happen the same everywhere .\ufb02 And therefore I decided to go home. I said, \ufb01That\u2122s the one place where nobody would tell me as a Jew you have to live. You have all the rights.\ufb02 And that was the reason."

            "answer": "Yes. After I became involved in my profession. In the dental associa tion I became one of the active members in the management of the or ganization. I became vice-president of the organization of the dental association in Israel. And because a big part of Jewish dentists in Israel, their origin was countries where they spoke German. If it was Czechoslovakia, even Poland, they spoke more German than Yiddish, or even Yiddish, they could understand German. And there was a necessity, there was not world literature in Hebrew in this profession. And we were interested as these people became more educated and more acquainted in the profession, which made progress terrible. Progress during the five years and then later on and on all the time. And there was English literature, which th e people didn\u2122t know. I spoke already a little bit English, but not enough to be fluent in literature or to give a lecture in English. The University has some professors which were lecturing in Eng lish. But for the mass, I mean for the majority of the dentists it wasn\u2122t understandable. So we needed German-s peaking lectures. And time by time, we start to bring in from Germany lecturer s, professors. And so I became acquainted with these professors. And we started to exchange normal relations between them. So we started organize even at the universities in Germany, some courses for the occasion, for progress, for professional progress. So we make a course in Bonn. We make a course in Berlin. We make a course in Munich. We make a course in Marbur g on the Lahn. It was in Frankfurt also some courses. Some from time to time there were a group of twenty, thirty people who can afford it, who are going only for education there. And that was the reason. And so I went with this group there. And I went to Bonn where I stayed for three months there. And I make my, my graduation doctor there in Bonn and then Marburg. That was the two universities. Marburg was a general university and Bonn was only a dental school. So here we got a dental license as a dental practitioner license and here you make your doctor up in Marburg. So you are a doctor and a dentist, both of it."

            "answer": "I can hardly say that you were angry, because nobody forced you to go. You have to, to have your attitude, you come there, you have to accept the reality. Of course, you knew exactly that you are stepping on the burning ground. You know this is not the place where you should be. But it is not only there. You start to think with the real terms even then already. This is the reality of life and this is the future of life. If you want to separate and if you want to be somebody else, chosen for something. There is no place for you on this world. You have to accommodate it to the future life. And this is th e future life. This is the future. Now you see what happens. Israel has relations with Germany, with France. However we know there are still a lot of anti-Semites. And they are everywhere. They are everyw here. But they are not because they are special anti-Semites. Th ere are anti-blacks, there are anti-yellows, there are anti-Asians, there are anti, all kinds of antis. This is the reality of the world now. You know, it sometimes is for me difficult to accept the gene ral view of the Jewish world about the Polish anti-Semites, about Poland. I born in Poland. I got my educati on in Poland. I lived there. And I was a Polish patriot. And so were many, the majority. Ther e were some Jews which didn\u2122t accept never that they are Poles. And to say that the Poles were all anti-Semites, I will not put this category, put them in this category. There were some intere sts. And people are behaving very often, very different in different situations. But to say a priori all the Polish are anti-Semites, it is exaggerated. It\u2122s not true. It\u2122s not true. But the same you can say about Jews. They are anti-Arabs, they are anti-Poles or anti-this. There are Jews who are anti-Jewish. Everything exists. But mainly I don\u2122t know how to categ orize it, even with my most sophisticated thinking, I think in every human body there is some anti, some anti. Anti- this, anti-him, anti, is it anti-blacks or some blacks? Or anti-yellows or just some ye llows? Anti-Asians. There is in every human being, there is an anti. But you have to come to some point that you ar e living in this world, which is very differentiated and if you will not accept this, there is no place for you. Because every day brings surprises. We are not done with wars. We are not done with discriminations. It was, it is and it will be forever, forever."

            "answer": "Well, this question is a very sensitive question. When you came to Israel, how difficult it is to say, there was a gap between these born Israelis, long living in Israel and newcomers in Israel. Like everywhere, a stranger gets feeling of a stranger. You are a stranger for a while until you are not accommodating to the reality. And then some gap, some gap, it is sixty years after establishment of Israel state, fifty-two years, but there\u2122s still differen ces between born Israelis, longest living Israelis and new coming Israelis. Is it good? It is reality. I don\u2122t know. I don\u2122t know. Maybe it is human nature. It\u2122s this kind of jealousy. But in the beginning when you came in, the feeling was a little bit different, because a lot of people in Israel, living in Israel, not born in Israel, but living in Israel for many years, who were the elite in Israel, came from Poland, Russia, maybe Czechoslovakia. Some came from Germany, too. Zionists. They felt the elite, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 36 36and you felt when you came in with a feeling how could you survive? You must have done something which is not right, that you could surv ive the Holocaust. Because my parents, my uncle, my grandparents, my brothe r, my sister, they were killed. Everybody.

And that gave me a very great advantage not to be singled out. That was worse with people who couldn\u2122t communicate. And they had to communicate in other language, which was in Yiddish or in German, and the Israeli-born children didn\u2122t speak Yiddish. They didn\u2122t want to speak Yiddish.

Coming from Hungary, are living with the Hungarians because of the language. I cannot say. We had people from different, from Hungary, from Romania, from Czechoslovakia, from Germany. And in reality, the most educated people which we met in Israel, which were the leading intelligentsia in Israel, they were original from these countries. From Germany, coming from Germany. Because the aliyah which came to Israel from the Arab countries, they were merchandise mostly. Very, ve ry, very few which were professionals. They all business men, all handy people, making something for a living. But in general, there were the poor people who came, that were the first who came into Israel. That was the big problem. They didn\u2122t have the language and they didn\u2122t have the\u2013 for them life was very difficult when they came poor. So there was difficult for apartment. They built temporary shelters for them. And they were living in these shelters for several ye ars until they somehow came out there. There are some of them living until today. Some of th em built houses on the places where the shelter houses were. They allowed them to build, so th ey gave them\u2013 because most of the land were belonging to the Keren Kayemeth. So they allowed them, these pe ople to settle on this places because the government wasn\u2122t able to give them stable living. So there are some slobs until today and there are some which built nice houses . And of course, with the time, the new generation there went to school and they make progress. And a lot of them came with their religious leaders, with their Rabbis. And then they settled in thei r own circles. And this is now Israel\u2122s greatest problem, is their religious Orthodox problem. With the Sephardic, Sephardic those are those, Sephardic in reality means the Spanish people. They don\u2122t have nothing to do with Spanish, except maybe their ancestors came from Spain. But generally they are Arabic Jews and they learn quite fast, Hebrew. And they arrange their life very nice. And they make terrible progress, very, very nice progress. But the problem of Israel is not solved and will never be solved in my opinion. That\u2122s war\u2013 my son, for example, was in two big wars, in the SixDay War and the Yom Kippur War. And that was one of the main reasons that he left Israel. He said he had enough of wars, when he came to the United States for studying his business, so he found that he would be better here. And he stayed here. And therefore we are here. We came after him, otherwise we wouldn\u2122t be here in the United States. I would be here in Israel until today. And I\u2122m not sorry that I did it, because I\u2122m not sorry of one step in my life. I don\u2122t look backwards. I take the reality. I am here happy. I live happy. And so is my son. I have two grandchildren. My granddaughter graduated now from the University here in Kentucky. But she lives also to Austin, Texas, where my son lives. And our grandson is in Virginia Beach.

And for her the language barrier in Israel was very difficult, very difficult. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 38 38She learned the daily language, but usually she couldn\u2122t live a cultural lif e, except going to concert and eventually from time to time with me to the theater. But usually it was a barrier for her. But we have a society where she could speak Polish, where she could speak German. And we had very wonderful company, very good friends . And then concerning our son, it came when he went to school, to elementary school. He aske d in the first grade, he asked about whether we could help him with something in his homework.

But of course when he growed up, when he went to high school and later on to military, he realized what happened and he asked some questions. But not too many, not too many, not too many.

            "answer": "You are right. In the first maybe ten years th ere was no talk about the Holocaust. Later on bit by bit it came out and they start to open more th e world and exchange of knowledge of the world, with all other countries in Europe and the United States. And the Jews from the United States, tourists used to come, family members looking, s earching for family and some of them finding. And there was always exposed to the Israeli inform ations in the papers and everywhere that was always the corner, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to find families, far families and families and friends from shtetl.

We wanted to see him because he was older than we are and we wanted to see him alive still. We supported him from Israel. We were sending parcels and money from time to time. And we supported him and he was very USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 40 40thankful. They were not rich people, very poor peasants. And he also wrote us that he will be happy to see us.

And there is the oldest synagogue in Europe, called before the world the Alte Shul. And there is now a Jewish museum. There is another thing there on this stre et, which is one of the oldest, maybe oldest too, maybe in the same time. I don\u2122t know exactly. The Remu Shul, the shul which is named after Reb Isserls, which was a Rabbi in Krakow in the, I guess it was in the fifteenth century if I am not wrong. There is still a shul and there are still Jews coming and there is a minyan and praying in Shabbas. And they\u2122re of course coming curious . And there is always a meeting of Jews who come visit Krakow. They are always coming there. And the site of this shul is the old cemetery which a gravestone of this famous Rabbi, Rabbi I sserls. They called the shul and they called the Rabbi \ufb01Remu\u2122. Rabbi Moshe Isserls. About him, used to say, \ufb01From Moses, to Moses was not like Moses Isserls.\ufb02 Was a very great Rabbi, w ho corrected one of the main Jewish religious books, the Shulchan Aruch, on which the Jews, the Western Jews were living their daily life. That was included every point of life from the Je ws. But I will go back to the museum. There are remnants from Jews in Krakow. There were several severed Torahs, Bibles, and all kind of religious utilities. And last but not least, there are many photos of old Jewish life in Krakow. And we were there for a Shabbat prayer at the Remu Synagogue which I mentioned before. And there were a minyan, there were even a group of young students from Canada came to visit Poland and they were visiting this shul and sitting all the pray and praying. And another thing which is to see of Jewish life, there is a Jewish cultural center on the Meilzel (ph) Street. A foundation of Canadian Jew, a _______________, and there are also kind of all Jewish life in the past and the present Jewish life. And they are cultural meetings. There are coming writers and meeting there and presenting their books. And there are Jewish books there in this unit there."

            "question": "Did seeing all of this inspire you at all to, to think about the possibility of Jewish life continuing in Poland? Did you ever consider living there yourself again?",
            "answer": "To answer this question is not easy. From a historical point of view I\u2122m sure Jews will live in Poland. First of all because of the root, of the roots. It may be even second, third, fourth and fifth generation, they have their Jewish ballast, if you want to say, which asks them to go back to the sources. This is one thing. The second thing is, of the globalization of the world. The world is globalizing. It has united Europe. In another few years if it will continue this way there will no be borders between European countries. It will be a united Europe and Jews are living in Europe and will live in Europe. We have the best example, Spain. The Jews were driven in the fifteenth century from Spain and there are Jews li ving there. There is a Jewish life in Spain. And there will be everywhere. There is Jewish life in Germany. We may not like it. We may not want it. But life is stronger than all our views. May it be po litical, philosophical, whatever it is, life has his right. Bread is easier. Where life is easier, people will always go. And that\u2122s my view. Maybe I\u2122m wrong. I don\u2122t know. But I am su re and I know that the last visit of the Pope in Israel gives a great contribution to somehow living together, Ca tholics and Jews. It is maybe ironic that in general even in the United States, people, Jewish people in general are more USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 43 43involved in general Christianity, maybe less in Catholic. Because there is a minority of Catholics. But Poland is ninety percent Catholics. And the Pope, his origin is Wadowice in Poland. And he was during the war behaving as a fellow Semite. And he now with his visit in Israel and his approach to the problem of Jewish\u0152Christian connection, I think opens more the door for Jews to go back to Poland. Maybe I am wr ong, maybe I am right. It is still a stereotype of American Jews which have a guilty feeling th at they didn\u2122t do nothing, nothing in time of the Holocaust to help their brothers. That they are putting all the guilt of the Holocaust on Polish people. I know the truth is that the majority of extermination, gas chambers and so forth was in the Polish territory. But I find my very answer, I think the main reason is that it was much easier for the Germans to make it where the biggest con centration of the Jews were. There was, in Poland was more Jews than all over the world. So instead to go to Holland or to go to Belgium or to go to Germany, of course they didn\u2122t want to take them because they were ashamed to bring the Jews to Germany. So I mean to this ot her little countries, to bring million of Jews it was for them impossible. Impossible. Physical ly it was impossible. Maybe it would be good if they had come to this idea. But their idea was to do this fast, fast and more able to do it was in Poland That\u2122s my opinion. Maybe I am wrong, but that is the reason. And of course, there is something to it that in Poland were no many objecti on to it. But there is another answer, Poland was the biggest country of this all occupied territories except France. But France has its own Anti-Semitic history, so we can put it in another perspective."

She is not clean, that means when she has her menstrua tion. Only after she goes, she has menstruation, after she finished and take a ritual bath, she is clean. And she is even with everybody. I don\u2122t say she is not even, I don\u2122t say this is a dirtiness or an illness, but it\u2122s ag ainst the teachings of our sages. And if you go on to take off barriers one by one, officially as permissible, you take the balance off Jewish religion. One of the two. You want to be Jewish you have to follow the teachings. Even when you don\u2122t follow, but you don\u2122t have to revolutionize it. That what I think. I am not kosher, for example. I am not doi ng a lot of things. I am riding on Shabbat.

You know, each community tries to make a museum, a Holocaust museum, which in itself is maybe a nice deed. But who will come to this museum? I think the Holocaust museum which is in Washington is the one which was a necessity, very important. And it fills all the spectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before the war, in the war and after the war. Maybe there are some nuances which come out which are not of value. But to make so many, I think people will not be interested to go to the main museum where th ey have everything. And this happens because of the way how Jewish society is built in the United Stat es. It has to be a society, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice-president, it has to be a secretary, it has to be members of the board and so forth and so forth. Ma ybe in itself it is as a social thing, maybe it is good, maybe. But I think a major ity of the raised funds goes to administrative use, the paperwork and to expenses which are not profit of the social needs of people who really needs the help. That is what I think. And about commercializing the Holocaust, I think when you take thousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these thousands you will make one book which includes everything. So there is no need, in my opinion, for so many editions, for so many work with it in\u2013 I don\u2122t know, I don\u2122t know.

But it is in the moment, I am ninety ye ars old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life with joy and suffering. It is like one Jewish sage said: \ufb01It is good to be born a Jew. It\u2122s good to die a Jew, but what do you do in the meantime, th is is the problem.\ufb02 From the beginning until the end, the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life, which many other religion or communities don\u2122t have. Not because they wanted, but the wind of history put the Jews in the center of cultural life. Even in the world. No t only in Germany, not only in Poland or in Russia or in Palestine or Spain or in the United States. Everywhere where the Jews were the center of civilized life, of cultural life was concentrated in the Jewish communities or singles. Jewish Nobel Prize winners, there were scientists in the United States in me dical field, in general science are not compatible to no on e other people. Maybe this is the reason that the jealousy of other people brings them to hatred. I cannot wish that the Jews wouldn\u2122t concentrate of all this progress and culture and civilization. A country they have to do everything possible what brings progress to the world. But I am turning to the other point not to cover this with egocentric religious or national use. To take it more in human general pers pective and civilized ways. This is my advice and this is my way of thinking. And that, and we will remember this, this can maybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with other nations in civilized world. That we will not be scapegoats in any way, which we were during all our history from the beginning until today. To avoid it, listen what I said. Thank you."
