            "answer": "Yes. I\u2122d been with -- I\u2122d written a senior paper during my last year in college, concerning the structure of national socialism, as we knew it at that time. And I read a few books, particularly by professors from the University of Chicago. And the book got a triple A, or the article got a tripi A -- triple A rating, and so I had an early interest USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 3 in the Nazi regime, way back in 1933 and \u201a34. Then I went off to the London School of Economics for a year and there were a number of refugees there, refugees from Hitler, who -- with whom I became friends and went out to dinner with and parties and so on. So I got to form some friendships that way. Then, of course, came the war and I was overseas for nearly [phone ringing]. Well, what was I saying?"

            "question": "Oh you\u2122d -- were at the London School of Economics.",
            "answer": "Oh, and I -- as I di -- was about to say, I traveled around Europe a bit and twice into Nazi Germany. I saw the wedding of Herm an Goering and Emma Sonamen on April 10, 1935. I traveled into the -- the ruhr, because I\u2122d met a German young man in London, who offered to show me the good hoff noseeter and to stay overnight in their house and so on. He did this knowing that I was anti-Nazi, but his family was rather re-reserved, because I don\u2122t think they wanted to -- they didn\u2122t want to take a chance of exposing themselves too much. Anyway , I also went out one evening with -- somewhere near Frankfurt, with the Reverend Stuart Herman, H-e-r-m-a-n, who later became the American pastor in Berlin. He ra -- He later wrote the book, \ufb01It\u2122s Your Souls We Want.\ufb02 And Stu Herman and I became lifelong friends, we\u2122re still corresponding. After I came back from London, I went to school with -- I went to Harvard Law School for three years and my club won the moot court arguments, and the case was based on a -- a -- a labor case. So when I went down to Washington, I went to the Labor Board and they hired me in a half an hour, based on the fact that I\u2122d contributed to this brief, which was on a point that was being argued before the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 4 Supreme Court. So that started four years of trial work. They used me as a trial lawyer. Then came the war and in 1942, I enlisted and within a month was again back in England, as a sergeant and later a warrant officer. I was in England for six months until the -- after the invasion of Africa by the allies. I then went to Iran, Algeria, as administrative officer to the Inspector General. In that capacity we traveled all over North Africa, inspecting American army installations. I then -- An old friend of mine, Gerhard VanArkel, who was the deputy head of the German labor branch of the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, came to Iran and asked me to come up and become the training officer for the labor desk in Algiers. I had a hard time getting away from my boss, but I finally managed and for some six months I trained Germans who had fought on the -- for the Loyalists in Spain. And th-these anti-Nazi Germans were being trained to do parachute jumping, to do signa ls -- signal work so they could send out messages after they\u2122d jumped into Germany, and so forth. Then I got a call from Washington to come and become the training officer at the central desk of OSS -- a central desk for labor and German operatives. And while I was there, Jack Ohly, O-h-l-y, whom I\u2122d known in Harvard Law School , saw me with my parachute wings and said, \ufb01You ha -- should come to work for the labor branch, helping us settle strikes and gathering labor for the short supply labor industries in the midwest.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t think the OSS will release me.\ufb02 His boss was Colonel Brennan, who later became a Supreme Court Justice. Colonel Brennan called Arthur Goldberg, who was my top boss and later a member of the Supr eme Court and convinced him that I should USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 5 perform this service. So, while that went on, the war finally came to an end and I came back to Washington with the idea of getting out of the army and returning to trial law for the labor board. At that time, s -- r -- Ju stice Robert H. Jackson had been appointed to be the US Chief of Council for war crimes. He made a statement which was released to the press on June second, 1945. I was so struck by it\u2122s -- not only it\u2122s understanding of the w -- the way Hitler had come to power, but of it\u2122s determination to see that the Nazi regime was exposed from beginning to end that it\u2122s top leaders were brought to justice and to an explanation of why they had committed the evils they had committed. I didn\u2122t know how to get with Justice Jackson\u2122s group, because I didn\u2122t know him at the time. So I went ba ck to OSS and my old fraternity brother, Robert Thrun, T-h-r-u-n, was one of the three assistants to Wild Bill Donovan, the head of OSS. General Wild Bill Donovan. And I had told him my dilemma, and he says, \ufb01Well, we can take care of that.\ufb02 So we went down to see the general council of OSS, who is another Donovan, a James D onovan. And Jim Donovan hired me within a half hour and for the next month or so, I busily engaged in studying in detail, the OSS reports on Nazi Germany, and they were terrific and very well done. And a professor by the name of Noiman had written a book on Nazi Germany -- just a second -- Noiman had written a book called, \ufb01Behemoth\ufb02 and I studied that in some detail and then went in to see him. And I told him of my background and he said, \ufb01Well, I -- Of course you\u2122re interested in the destruction of the trade unions by the Nazis.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Yes.\ufb02 He reached back and pulled out a German book that had been obtained by USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 6 OSS through Switzerland. And, an appendix in that German book contained the order of Robert Ley, L-e-y, the later defendant at Nuremberg who committed suicide. And Robert Ley had written this order on how the SA -- the Storm Troopers and the SS were to take over the trade unions. Well, this gave me the basis for not only a brief and for a -- an eventual presentation to the tribunal, it also gave me leads to labor leader with whom OSS was in touch, both in London and some of them in Germany. So I flew to London, Paris and then went into Germany to visit some of these trade union leaders. And I got affidavits from all of them and those affidavits were all introduced in the Nuremberg -- first Nuremberg trial. Neither one of the affiants was cross-examined by the defense, they didn\u2122t questi on at all the -- the horrors that surrounded that particular aspect of the Nazi regime. The result was that that made some impression on Justice Jackson and later on others and the main deputy to Jackson, Colonel Robert G. Storey, who later became head of the American Bar Association, he was quite impressed by this work and said, \ufb01You must make some -- a presentation to the tribunal,\ufb02 which of course delighted me. And he assigned me the case of a Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader, who later became the Gauleiter of Vienna."

The -- Y-Your own writings bear testimony to what happened, but if we move forward, how do you look back on it and do you feel that it\u2122s been evolving over many years, the impact?",
            "answer": "The impact of the Nuremberg trial on American public opinion was considerable for approximately one year. And then, with the coming of the -- after the war, with the coming of the Cold War, American opinion and the journalists and so on, turned very rapidly toward discussions of the Cold War and the Nazis and the Nuremberg trials were very much played down and not talked up for some time. I turned away to other things here in America, and then got invol ved in some business affairs and then got into Behavioral Science and teaching at George Washington University in Behavioral Science, which is a new field for me, but I r eally worked hard to get there and a couple of professors were kind of pushing me to do th at. And then I began to get interested in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 8 Nuremberg again, particularly after I th -- more or less retired, although I -- I didn\u2122t completely retire from training and consulting. But I slowed down a lot and I started to first work on Baldur von Schirach, the usel -- the youth leader, who -- wh-whom I had particularly prosecuted, I\u2122d made the principal presentation against him. Then I decided I\u2122d switch to something which was talked more about and that was Julius Streicher, the top Jew baiter of all time. But then, a lot was written about him, and so I started to move toward the idea of seeing if I couldn\u2122t contribute something different by writing the most elaborate book, the mo st comprehensive book on the Nuremberg trials, one which would agree with most of the conclusions that many other writers have made, but which would go beyond that, into the depth of the evidence, and particularly quotations from the contempor aneous documents and from the testimony of the 20 -- of the 22 defendants who were at Nuremberg -- 21 defendants. The consequence was that I finally developed a huge book, far too long for publication. It was rejected by a number of commercial presses as being financially unbearable with it\u2122s length, and I think it was, especially for a commercial press. I then started approaching university presses and they all insisted that the book should be reduced somewhat in size, so it\u2122d fit into two volumes, rather than three. And so I spent a couple of years doing the difficult task of condensing. And finally, the university press of America, based on all the commendations that I had and their own scholarly research, decided that the book did have a special role to play and so I\u2122m -- was very USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 9 glad to sign a contract with them and my book will be published in late December -- or late No-November or early December."

            "answer": "Yes, that\u2122s what distinguishes the book mainly. I don\u2122t attempt to be the final preacher about the Nazi regime, but I mean to make the account of the trial available, so that many scholars and a lot of others that are r-really interested and willing to spend some time, can really delve into the contemporaneous documents and particularly into the motivations of the defendants. It\u2122s so false for people to think of the Nuremberg in terms of defendants sayi ng, \ufb01I was following superior orders.\ufb02 These defendants worked for years for the Nazis and superior orders defense applies mainly to lower people in the -- at the bottom of the hierarchy, who are told to go and shoot somebody or to commit some atrocious crime. The people at the top give their loyalties to a regime over a period of time, and they do it for many different reasons. It has little to do with, I was ordered to do this by somebody. Most of the enthusiastically worked for the Nazi regime. Some of them, of course, had great reservations and some of them wept as they gave their tes timony, being very sorry indeed, for having associated themselves with such an evil course of conduct."

            "answer": "Oh yes, I -- You don\u2122t do anything as significant as the Nuremberg trial was, in reviewing a modern dictatorship, without th at having a tremendous effect emotionally, on you. I think the importance of the trial is much more on what it revealed than in the fact that it punished 19 defendants, and acquitted three. The effect of the trial later on, was very mixed. For some years, it had very little effect, and then as war crimes were committed in ce-central Europe, particularly in Yugoslavia, and then later in Rwanda, world attention turned much more to what international law was, that international law USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 12 was being violated, and that there was no established structure to deal with these crimes, and that no court was available which was -- had jurisdiction to handle these matters. So then you started to get the f oundation laid and an international treaty signed to create the Yugoslav war crimes tri bunal, and later on the United Nations also created the Rwanda tribunal. The Rwanda tribunal has had a great number of difficulties. It was poorly staffed, poorly financed and was not well taken -- it was not well administrated. On the contrary, I thi nk the -- the beginnings of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal are very promising. They do not have the number of contemporaneous documents or the great amount of contempor aneous documents which we had in the Nuremberg trial. This means they have to rely much more on investigations and interrogating witnesses and that\u2122s a much more difficult job to do when you don\u2122t have all the knowledge that we had about the detailed operation of the Nazi regime."

After all, you\u2122re a Badger Beauty, and if you go in there, we\u2122ll cause -- with me -- we\u2122ll cause quite a sensation.\ufb02 So we ap -- walked into the sorority house at the time of that party and people\u2122s jaws dropped. However, within minutes, everybody wanted to dance with Beverly Rabinoff. All the men wanted to dance with her and I was left alone throughout most of the evening while other people danced with Beverly Rabinoff. So that was a small contribution to integration."

            "answer": "Well, I became very active in politics after I returned from Nuremberg. Up to that time, I had been an active Democrat in the sense of making a few contributions to the Democratic party and congressional campaign committees and so on, but I hadn\u2122t been very active. But when I came back from Nuremberg, my wife was also an active Democrat and I settled out in Potomac, Maryland area, which is largely an area of relatively wealthy people. And a lot of brainy people, a lot of intellectuals who had done well. So we formed -- I became precinct chairman and we also formed a -- a group out there, which was calculated to give talks about -- in the churches and otherwise, about anti-Semitism and -- and so forth and the local pastors were all for this. Reverend Gloid Alice in the Methodist church was one of our great supporters and so forth. So, yes, this did have an e-effect and I went down to the hill with the idea of becoming an assistant to somebody that wa s helping on small business affairs, since I was running a couple of small businesse s. A land development company and a construction company out in Potomac. A nd I met Senator Sparkman, head of the Senate small business committee, and Rite Patman, the head of the House small USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 20 business committee. I went in to s -- Th ey said I should go see Paul Butler, the national chairman of the Democratic party and I did and he established the small business division of the Democrat national committee, which was composed of me and my secretary, no more. And we developed a lot of literature, which was broadly circulated to the state parties, county and local people, concerning small business issues. So that was my first move, actively into politics. About a year later, after the 1956 election, I was back to doing what I had been doing before, someone said -- Paul Butler, the national chairman, was forming a new s-structures to the Democratic national committee, which was going to pull together the political organization and build up more precincts and ex-extend the am ount of public relations that the national committee was going to have with the local organizations between elections. So I went in to see Paul Butler and he immediately said , \ufb01Well, I\u2122d like to hire you, but I have to consult with the advisory committee on political organization.\ufb02 So I flew out to Michigan to see former congressman, Neal Staebler, S-t-a-e-b-l-e-r, who was the state chairman of the Democratic party in Michig an. And he introduced me to the Michigan leaders, and we sat down and had a dinner together and they queried me and they came back with the recommendation that I be made deputy chairman of the national committee -- deputy chairman for political organization. And we then hired a total of six regional representatives, each one of whom had six to eight states, and he -- they traveled around, building up ideas of better Democratic organization, and not trying to be pushy, but ta -- get more people involved, hold more meetings and they would be USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 21 available to see what was happening in another state, to help -- still a different state, ye -- other notions and ideas and try new things out and things like that."

            "answer": "Well, aft -- right after the first trial, the general assembly of the United Nations, enacted a declaration on international law and affirming the principles of Nuremberg. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 24 I\u2122m not sure that that made a tremendous efe -- had a tremendous effect on the -- large numbers of people, but it did contribut e to those who were concerned with international law and with strengthening the United Nations and international law. The Nuremberg trial set a precedent for trials held immediately after the first trial. In Nuremberg there were 12 other trials, a to tal of about 190 other people were tried. Then there were trials in the British war zone. There were trials in the French war zone. We didn\u2122t hear about any trials in the Soviet zone. The Soviet representative at the first Nuremberg trial, left Nuremberg the -- just after th-the tribunal made it\u2122s decision in the first trial and they never associated with the later trials, at their election. However, they did allow our representatives to carry on investigations in the Soviet zone and they were cooperative in that respect. About two years later, during the later trials, a press contingent of Soviet journalists, did come to Nuremberg for one or two days and I recall sitting in with General Taylor as he was asked questions by them. And of course, we tried to turn it around and ask them a few questions as to why there were -- had been some trials that we knew about in the eastern zone of Germany, and they were rather embarrassed by that. Toward the end of the trials, the Genocide Convention was enacted as a treaty and it is of course, since been ratified by almost all nations. it took the United States quite some time to recognize it, because again some people, raising the banner of sovereignty were worried that the Genocide Convention would give other people the right to look into what was happening in the United States. The declaration of -- of human rights by the General Assembly was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 25 [indecipherable] related to the rights we ex -- expounded at Nuremberg. And Eleanor Roosevelt at that time, said, \ufb01This is a fi ne declaration on human rights, but without some legal obligations, will governments be inspired to see that these rights are enforced?\ufb02 And of course, that was a very incisive comment. The -- As I\u2122ve mentioned, the international law committee of the United Nations did reaffirm the Nuremberg principles and this led -- after we left Germany, this helped lead to a tremendous number of trials of Germans, by the German courts. This is something most people don\u2122t know anything about. Th ere\u2122s a whole book on it by a gentleman by the name of Rukerle, who was -- who was in charge of keeping track of these war crimes trials. And there\u2122s been a treme ndous number of books pub lished in Germany, which deal with the Nazi regime and an American photographer by the name of Ray Daddario, has cooperated with the German authorities in publishing a number of photographs concerning the Nazi regime and th e Nuremberg trial, and these have sold very well. In Berlin there are at least two striking exhibitions that refer back to the Nazi period. One is in the old Reichstag building, and there they have a photographic exhibit that must be a half block long, where you walk along and you get pictures of the development of the Nazi regime, including it\u2122s horrors. A little ways away from that, there is a -- what\u2122s called a Platzenzae memo-memorial. And that\u2122s a very striking memorial. It has a -- a marble wall which says, in German, \ufb01To the victims of Fascism.\ufb02 A little ways away, there\u2122s a circular statue -- there\u2122s a statue with a -- a base which is circular and it has arrows which point in the direction of various USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 26 concentration camps, Auschwitz, Flossenb\u00fcrg, Buchenwald. And it\u2122s very striking, you can\u2122t think as you walk by that, without realizing that in each of these concentration camps, hundreds of thousands and in the case of Auschwitz, millions of people were killed. The German Minister of Justice has spoken out about the significance of the Nuremberg trials. There\u2122s been a tremendous turnaround in German thinking, partly as a result of the Nuremberg trials. Course, one of the striking things about the Vietnam war is that a couple of our officers also went on a binge of killing Vietnamese citizens, the kind of thing that can happen when an ideologically motivated person is not constrained and is willing to kill people, certainly outside the law. This led to the conviction of Lieutenant William Calley, C-a-l-l-e-y, a junior officer in the US army. So this is one case where we\u2122ve applied international law to one of our own officers, which is a good thing.

Th e trouble is that an agreement was made with Saddam Hussein, which didn\u2122t provide for any permanent occu -- occupation and which didn\u2122t provide for any war crimes tria ls, and which allowed him, over time, to re-institute a dictatorship of the first water. Now, that is utterly different than Nuremberg, where we -- the allies that occupied the country, they not only conducted war crimes trials, but they assisted the democratic elements, which were latent in Germany, to slowly develop and to come out .

I suppose the next thing would be what happened in Yugoslavia, and -- beginning in 1991, when military forces of Serbia invaded Bosnia and Croatia, there were atrocities committed on a huge scale and the fact that there had been a Nuremberg trial certainly did help, with respect to the creation of the international USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 28 criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
