            "answer": "I\u2019m Drexel A. Sprecher. I was a prosecutor at Nuremberg, and I\u2019ve been writing a book on Nuremberg called, \u201cInside the Nuremberg Trial, A Prosecutor\u2019s Comprehensive Account.\u201d I\u2019ve been working on it for nearly 10 years.

            "answer": "Yes. I'd been with -- I\u2019d written a senior paper during my last year in college, concerning the structure of national socialism, as we knew it at that time. And I read a few books, particularly by professors from the University of Chicago. And the book got a triple A, or the article got a tripi A -- triple A rating, and so I had an early interest in the Nazi regime, way back in 1933 and \u201834. Then I went off to the London School of Economics for a year and there were a number of refugees there, refugees from Hitler, who -- with whom I became friends and went out to dinner with and parties and so on. So I got to form some friendships that way. Then, of course, came the war and I was overseas for nearly [phone ringing]. Well, what was I saying?"

            "question": "Oh you\u2019d -- were at the London School of Economics.",
            "answer": "Oh, and I -- as I di -- was about to say, I traveled around Europe a bit and twice into Nazi Germany. I saw the wedding of Herman Goering and Emma Sonamen on April 10, 1935. I traveled into the -- the ruhr, because I\u2019d met a German young man in London, who offered to show me the good hoffnoseeter and to stay overnight in their house and so on. He did this knowing that I was anti-Nazi, but his family was rather re-reserved, because I don\u2019t think they wanted to -- they didn\u2019t want to take a chance of exposing themselves too much. Anyway, I also went out one evening with -- somewhere near Frankfurt, with the Reverend Stuart Herman, H-e-r-m-a-n, who later became the American pastor in Berlin. He ra -- He later wrote the book, \u201cIt\u2019s Your Souls We Want.\u201d And Stu Herman and I became lifelong friends, we\u2019re still corresponding. After I came back from London, I went to school with -- I went to Harvard Law School for three years and my club won the moot court arguments, and the case was based on a -- a -- a labor case. So when I went down to Washington, I went to the Labor Board and they hired me in a half an hour, based on the fact that I\u2019d contributed to this brief, which was on a point that was being argued before the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Supreme Court. So that started four years of trial work. They used me as a trial lawyer. Then came the war and in 1942, I enlisted and within a month was again back in England, as a sergeant and later a warrant officer. I was in England for six months until the -- after the invasion of Africa by the allies. I then went to Iran, Algeria, as administrative officer to the Inspector General. In that capacity we traveled all over North Africa, inspecting American army installations. I then -- An old friend of mine, Gerhard VanArkel, who was the deputy head of the German labor branch of the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, came to Iran and asked me to come up and become the training officer for the labor desk in Algiers. I had a hard time getting away from my boss, but I finally managed and for some six months I trained Germans who had fought on the -- for the Loyalists in Spain. And th-these anti-Nazi Germans were being trained to do parachute jumping, to do signals -- signal work so they could send out messages after they\u2019d jumped into Germany, and so forth. Then I got a call from Washington to come and become the training officer at the central desk of OSS -- a central desk for labor and German operatives. And while I was there, Jack Ohly, O-h- l-y, whom I\u2019d known in Harvard Law School, saw me with my parachute wings and said, \u201cYou ha -- should come to work for the labor branch, helping us settle strikes and gathering labor for the short supply labor industries in the midwest.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the OSS will release me.\u201d His boss was Colonel Brennan, who later became a Supreme Court Justice. Colonel Brennan called Arthur Goldberg, who was my top boss and later a member of the Supreme Court and convinced him that I should perform this service. So, while that went on, the war finally came to an end and I came back to Washington with the idea of getting out of the army and returning to trial law for the labor board. At that time, s -- r -- Justice Robert H. Jackson had been appointed to be the US Chief of Council for war crimes. He made a statement which was released to the press on June second, 1945. I was so struck by it\u2019s -- not only it\u2019s understanding of the w -- the way Hitler had come to power, but of it\u2019s determination to see that the Nazi regime was exposed from beginning to end that it\u2019s top leaders were brought to justice and to an explanation of why they had committed the evils they had committed. I didn\u2019t know how to get with Justice Jackson\u2019s group, because I didn\u2019t know him at the time. So I went back to OSS and my old fraternity brother, Robert Thrun, T-h-r-u-n, was one of the three assistants to Wild Bill Donovan, the head of OSS. General Wild Bill Donovan. And I had told him my dilemma, and he says, \u201cWell, we can take care of that.\u201d So we went down to see the general council of OSS, who is another Donovan, a James Donovan. And Jim Donovan hired me within a half hour and for the next month or so, I busily engaged in studying in detail, the OSS reports on Nazi Germany, and they were terrific and very well done. And a professor by the name of Noiman had written a book on Nazi Germany -- just a second -- Noiman had written a book called, \u201cBehemoth\u201d and I studied that in some detail and then went in to see him. And I told him of my background and he said, \u201cWell, I -- Of course you\u2019re interested in the destruction of the trade unions by the Nazis.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He reached back and pulled out a German book that had been obtained by OSS through Switzerland. And, an appendix in that German book contained the order of Robert Ley, L-e-y, the later defendant at Nuremberg who committed suicide. And Robert Ley had written this order on how the SA -- the Storm Troopers and the SS were to take over the trade unions. Well, this gave me the basis for not only a brief and for a -- an eventual presentation to the tribunal, it also gave me leads to labor leader with whom OSS was in touch, both in London and some of them in Germany. So I flew to London, Paris and then went into Germany to visit some of these trade union leaders. And I got affidavits from all of them and those affidavits were all introduced in the Nuremberg -- first Nuremberg trial. Neither one of the affiants was cross- examined by the defense, they didn\u2019t question at all the -- the horrors that surrounded that particular aspect of the Nazi regime. The result was that that made some impression on Justice Jackson and later on others and the main deputy to Jackson, Colonel Robert G. Storey, who later became head of the American Bar Association, he was quite impressed by this work and said, \u201cYou must make some -- a presentation to the tribunal,\u201d which of course delighted me. And he assigned me the case of a Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader, who later became the Gauleiter of Vienna."

            "answer": "Yes, as soon as I heard Justice Jack -- read Justice Jackson\u2019s report, I knew there was where Sprecher should next go. And so I\u2019d determined to get there one way or the other, and it turned out to be a relatively easy path."

            "question": "And then, what did -- what do you feel the Nuremberg trial -- what do you feel the effect was on you later? The -- Y-Your own writings bear testimony to what happened, but if we move forward, how do you look back on it and do you feel that it\u2019s been evolving over many years, the impact?",
            "answer": "The impact of the Nuremberg trial on American public opinion was considerable for approximately one year. And then, with the coming of the -- after the war, with the coming of the Cold War, American opinion and the journalists and so on, turned very rapidly toward discussions of the Cold War and the Nazis and the Nuremberg trials were very much played down and not talked up for some time. I turned away to other things here in America, and then got involved in some business affairs and then got into Behavioral Science and teaching at George Washington University in Behavioral Science, which is a new field for me, but I really worked hard to get there and a couple of professors were kind of pushing me to do that. And then I began to get interested in Nuremberg again, particularly after I th -- more or less retired, although I -- I didn\u2019t completely retire from training and consulting. But I slowed down a lot and I started to first work on Baldur von Schirach, the usel -- the youth leader, who -- wh-whom I had particularly prosecuted, I\u2019d made the principal presentation against him. Then I decided I\u2019d switch to something which was talked more about and that was Julius Streicher, the top Jew baiter of all time. But then, a lot was written about him, and so I started to move toward the idea of seeing if I couldn\u2019t contribute something different by writing the most elaborate book, the most comprehensive book on the Nuremberg trials, one which would agree with most of the conclusions that many other writers have made, but which would go beyond that, into the depth of the evidence, and particularly quotations from the contemporaneous documents and from the testimony of the 20 -- of the 22 defendants who were at Nuremberg -- 21 defendants. The consequence was that I finally developed a huge book, far too long for publication. It was rejected by a number of commercial presses as being financially unbearable with it\u2019s length, and I think it was, especially for a commercial press. I then started approaching university presses and they all insisted that the book should be reduced somewhat in size, so it\u2019d fit into two volumes, rather than three. And so I spent a couple of years doing the difficult task of condensing. And finally, the university press of America, based on all the commendations that I had and their own scholarly research, decided that the book did have a special role to play and so I\u2019m -- was very glad to sign a contract with them and my book will be published in late December -- or late No-November or early December."

            "answer": "Yes, that\u2019s what distinguishes the book mainly. I don\u2019t attempt to be the final preacher about the Nazi regime, but I mean to make the account of the trial available, so that many scholars and a lot of others that are r-really interested and willing to spend some time, can really delve into the contemporaneous documents and particularly into the motivations of the defendants. It\u2019s so false for people to think of the Nuremberg in terms of defendants saying, \u201cI was following superior orders.\u201d These defendants worked for years for the Nazis and superior orders defense applies mainly to lower people in the -- at the bottom of the hierarchy, who are told to go and shoot somebody or to commit some atrocious crime. The people at the top give their loyalties to a regime over a period of time, and they do it for many different reasons. It has little to do with, I was ordered to do this by somebody. Most of the enthusiastically worked for the Nazi regime. Some of them, of course, had great reservations and some of them wept as they gave their testimony, being very sorry indeed, for having associated themselves with such an evil course of conduct."

            "question": "When you talked of Nuremberg and the fact that it was only for a year that 1t was extensively covered in the American press, I -- I\u2019d like you to say more about that, because I\u2019m sure you feel that the very holding of the tribunal was immensely important in documenting what had gone on. I -- I was just reading about Benjamin Firense a-as just one small example of somebody gathering evidence. But I\u2019m sure we gained immensely through -- in many ways, through holding the tribunal.",
            "answer": "Yes, Professor Firense came to Nuremberg and when he find -- found out about the Einsatzgruppen, he immediately started to make some proposals to General Telford Taylor about his leading that -- the case against the main leaders of the Einsatzgruppen, the special task forces which killed millions -- a couple million Jews. And he did this with great ability and aplomb and he presented the case almost entirely with documents in an -- less than a day and one half. The case went on for months after that, by the defense, but the prosecutions case, in the shortest Nuremberg case of all -- the short -- the shortest case of the prosecution, was the one conducted by Firense. I became the head of several divisions, the subsequent proceedings division, economics division, chief of the I. G. Farben trial team, and later, deputy chief council in charge of the official publications. At -- Firense had been offered the job, by Telford Taylor, of being director of publications. He turned it down in order to become head of the Jewish successor restitution organization and he recovered from German firms tha- who had employed slave labor and who\u2019d taken property from Jews, he recovered vast quantities of money for the people involved at -- the survivors of the -- of the people that were involved or the -- some of the people who still survived. And to this day, he\u2019s one of my best friends."

Have you talked with these colleagues about the impact or the effect of Nuremberg on your lives, and is there any similarity, sort of commonality of experience?",
            "answer": "I\u2019ve talked to almost all the survivors, in fact, I was the chairman of the executive committee that put on three Nuremberg reunions, beginning in 1979, nine -- then another 1991 and one in 1996 at the -- more or less at the 50th anniversary of the end of the first Nuremberg trial. And I\u2019m in touch with almost all these prosecutors. I\u2019ve sent them chapters from my forthcoming book. I\u2019ve asked for their criticisms and their comments. I don\u2019t think anybody surviving knows as much about the people who were in Nuremberg than -- than I do. I don\u2019t think so, because of my continued work on this subject. I have constantly wanted to be in touch with them."

            "question": "And what do you think the impact has been? Has it colored everything that you\u2019 ve done subsequently?",
            "answer": "Oh yes, I -- You don\u2019t do anything as significant as the Nuremberg trial was, in reviewing a modern dictatorship, without that having a tremendous effect emotionally, on you. I think the importance of the trial is much more on what it revealed than in the fact that it punished 19 defendants, and acquitted three. The effect of the trial later on, was very mixed. For some years, it had very little effect, and then as war crimes were committed in ce-central Europe, particularly in Yugoslavia, and then later in Rwanda, world attention turned much more to what international law was, that international law was being violated, and that there was no established structure to deal with these crimes, and that no court was available which was -- had jurisdiction to handle these matters. So then you started to get the foundation laid and an international treaty signed to create the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, and later on the United Nations also created the Rwanda tribunal. The Rwanda tribunal has had a great number of difficulties. It was poorly staffed, poorly financed and was not well taken -- it was not well administrated. On the contrary, I think the -- the beginnings of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal are very promising. They do not have the number of contemporaneous documents or the great amount of contemporaneous documents which we had in the Nuremberg trial. This means they have to rely much more on investigations and interrogating witnesses and that\u2019s a much more difficult job to do when you don\u2019t have all the knowledge that we had about the detailed operation of the Nazi regime."

They aren\u2019t international opinion on the whole, is not in the same position of knowledge with respect to what\u2019s going on. And you don\u2019t have the same push, the same public demand. And the tremendous number of countries are so troubled by their own internal problems that they have not pushed the United Nations or the established tribunal to do more, more quickly, and they haven\u2019t given it as much funding and -- as they should. There are some very able people that have gone into the leadership of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal and I wish them well. I think that they are going to make a -- a big contribution in the long run."

Nuremberg is not something that wears out of your life with time. It -- It becomes a -- an area where you think about it at night and you think about it in the morning and you wonder what can the world do, what can -- how can public opinion be advanced so that they\u2019re willing to reduce the rights of national sovereignty to a greater extent and to make the international law really international and enforceable by international agency. There are a tremendous number of isolationists and people who raise their hands and say, \u201cWe don\u2019t want any foreigners in a position where they can possibly judge Americans.\u201d There\u2019s a certain appeal in that for citizens who are not too well informed, and it\u2019s regrettable."

One of my professors was Selac Perlman, who was the chief historian of labor developments in this country. And I can remember one day in a seminar that he burst into tears as someone mentioned what was happening in Nazi Germany. And it was a very moving moment and I can still remember it very well. Max Carl Otto was a -- an American of German descent who was very anti-Nazi and he was also one of my heroes at the University of Wisconsin. I was asked to run the conference on war at the University of Wisconsin, shortly after Hitler came to power, and we gathered leaders, including people from military academies and professors from both Wisconsin and other universities, some ministers, like Re-Reverend Alf da -- Alfred W. Swan and others and they made talks and there was questions by the students and there were some demonstrations about how important the whole thing was, by some of the students.

After all, you\u2019re a Badger Beauty, and if you go in there, we\u2019ll cause- with me -- we\u2019ll cause quite a sensation.\u201d So we ap -- walked into the sorority house at the time of that party and people\u2019s jaws dropped. However, within minutes, everybody wanted to dance with Beverly Rabinoff. All the men wanted to dance with her and I was left alone throughout most of the evening while other people danced with Beverly Rabinoff. So that was a small contribution to integration."

And so there was some things like that. The dean of students, a fellow by the name of Holt, H-o-I-t, his son was in our fraternity. We went to his house and -- and the overall dean was Scott Goodenite. Bill Blaiser, who was the head of the student union, and I, went up to see him and told him that we were about to try something, that we wanted him to know what it was. Some Jews had gone onto the pier that stuck out into Lake Mindoda, of one of the fraternity houses -- I forget the name of it right now. And a fellow by the name of Max Knecht, K-n-e-c-h-t, who was the boxing champion of the big 10, went out with a couple of his fraternity brothers and threw these Jews in the lake. And this, of course, made a lot of newspaper publicity. Blaiser -- Bill Blaiser and I didn\u2019t want it to die at that point, so we went to Goodenite and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going down to see --\u201d Blaiser was over six feet tall and so was I, and together we weren\u2019t too afraid of Max Knecht. So we went down to the fraternity and asked to see him and he blustered out and said, \u201cWhat are you liberals doing here?\u201d We said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to tell you that if you were to repeat what you did before, we can give you the straight word that you\u2019d be ostracized from the university and that we would gather a group of people and throw you in the lake just to show that we wouldn\u2019t take this kind of thing any more.\u201d And he said, \u201cRrrr,\u201d and turned around, banged the door and left.

            "answer": "Well, I became very active in politics after I returned from Nuremberg. Up to that time, I had been an active Democrat in the sense of making a few contributions to the Democratic party and congressional campaign committees and so on, but I hadn\u2019t been very active. But when I came back from Nuremberg, my wife was also an active Democrat and I settled out in Potomac, Maryland area, which 1s largely an area of relatively wealthy people. And a lot of brainy people, a lot of intellectuals who had done well. So we formed -- I became precinct chairman and we also formed a -- a group out there, which was calculated to give talks about -- in the churches and otherwise, about anti-Semitism and -- and so forth and the local pastors were all for this. Reverend Gloid Alice in the Methodist church was one of our great supporters and so forth. So, yes, this did have an e-effect and I went down to the hill with the idea of becoming an assistant to somebody that was helping on small business affairs, since I was running a couple of small businesses. A land development company and a construction company out in Potomac. And I met Senator Sparkman, head of the Senate small business committee, and Rite Patman, the head of the House small business committee. I went in to s -- They said I should go see Paul Butler, the national chairman of the Democratic party and I did and he established the small business division of the Democrat national committee, which was composed of me and my secretary, no more. And we developed a lot of literature, which was broadly circulated to the state parties, county and local people, concerning small business issues. So that was my first move, actively into politics. About a year later, after the 1956 election, I was back to doing what I had been doing before, someone said -- Paul Butler, the national chairman, was forming a new s-structures to the Democratic national committee, which was going to pull together the political organization and build up more precincts and ex-extend the amount of public relations that the national committee was going to have with the local organizations between elections. So I went in to see Paul Butler and he immediately said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to hire you, but I have to consult with the advisory committee on political organization.\u201d So I flew out to Michigan to see former congressman, Neal Staebler, S-t-a-e-b-l-e-r, who was the state chairman of the Democratic party in Michigan. And he introduced me to the Michigan leaders, and we sat down and had a dinner together and they queried me and they came back with the recommendation that I be made deputy chairman of the national committee -- deputy chairman for political organization. And we then hired a total of six regional representatives, each one of whom had six to eight states, and he -- they traveled around, building up ideas of better Democratic organization, and not trying to be pushy, but ta -- get more people involved, hold more meetings and they would be available to see what was happening in another state, to help -- still a different state, ye- other notions and ideas and try new things out and things like that."

            "answer": "Well, aft -- right after the first trial, the general assembly of the United Nations, enacted a declaration on international law and affirming the principles of Nuremberg. I\u2019m not sure that that made a tremendous efe -- had a tremendous effect on the -- large numbers of people, but it did contribute to those who were concerned with international law and with strengthening the United Nations and international law. The Nuremberg trial set a precedent for trials held immediately after the first trial. In Nuremberg there were 12 other trials, a total of about 190 other people were tried. Then there were trials in the British war zone. There were trials in the French war zone. We didn\u2019t hear about any trials in the Soviet zone. The Soviet representative at the first Nuremberg trial, left Nuremberg the -- just after th-the tribunal made it\u2019s decision in the first trial and they never associated with the later trials, at their election. However, they did allow our representatives to carry on investigations in the Soviet zone and they were cooperative in that respect. About two years later, during the later trials, a press contingent of Soviet journalists, did come to Nuremberg for one or two days and I recall sitting in with General Taylor as he was asked questions by them. And of course, we tried to turn it around and ask them a few questions as to why there were -- had been some trials that we knew about in the eastern zone of Germany, and they were rather embarrassed by that. Toward the end of the trials, the Genocide Convention was enacted as a treaty and it is of course, since been ratified by almost all nations. it took the United States quite some time to recognize it, because again some people, raising the banner of sovereignty were worried that the Genocide Convention would give other people the right to look into what was happening in the United States. The declaration of -- of human rights by the General Assembly was [indecipherable] related to the rights we ex -- expounded at Nuremberg. And Eleanor Roosevelt at that time, said, \u201cThis is a fine declaration on human rights, but without some legal obligations, will governments be inspired to see that these rights are enforced?\u201d And of course, that was a very incisive comment. The -- As I\u2019ve mentioned, the international law committee of the United Nations did reaffirm the Nuremberg principles and this led -- after we left Germany, this helped lead to a tremendous number of trials of Germans, by the German courts. This is something most people don\u2019t know anything about. There\u2019s a whole book on it by a gentleman by the name of Rukerle, who was -- who was in charge of keeping track of these war crimes trials. And there\u2019s been a tremendous number of books published in Germany, which deal with the Nazi regime and an American photographer by the name of Ray Daddario, has cooperated with the German authorities in publishing a number of photographs concerning the Nazi regime and the Nuremberg trial, and these have sold very well. In Berlin there are at least two striking exhibitions that refer back to the Nazi period. One is in the old Reichstag building, and there they have a photographic exhibit that must be a half block long, where you walk along and you get pictures of the development of the Nazi regime, including it\u2019s horrors. A little ways away from that, there is a -- what\u2019s called a Platzenzae memo-memorial. And that\u2019s a very striking memorial. It has a -- a marble wall which says, in German, \u201cTo the victims of Fascism.\u201d A little ways away, there\u2019s a circular statue -- there\u2019s a statue with a -- a base which is circular and it has arrows which point in the direction of various concentration camps, Auschwitz, Flossenburg, Buchenwald. And it\u2019s very striking, you can\u2019t think as you walk by that, without realizing that in each of these concentration camps, hundreds of thousands and in the case of Auschwitz, millions of people were killed. The German Minister of Justice has spoken out about the significance of the Nuremberg trials. There\u2019s been a tremendous turnaround in German thinking, partly as a result of the Nuremberg trials. Course, one of the striking things about the Vietnam war is that a couple of our officers also went on a binge of killing Vietnamese citizens, the kind of thing that can happen when an ideologically motivated person is not constrained and 1s willing to kill people, certainly outside the law. This led to the conviction of Lieutenant William Calley, C-a-l-l-e-y, a junior officer in the US army. So this is one case where we\u2019ve applied international law to one of our own officers, which is a good thing.

This was done in a magnificent fashion, by a -- special troops. The trouble is that an agreement was made with Saddam Hussein, which didn\u2019t provide for any permanent occu -- occupation and which didn\u2019t provide for any war crimes trials, and which allowed him, over time, to re-institute a dictatorship of the first water. Now, that is utterly different than Nuremberg, where we -- the allies that occupied the country, they not only conducted war crimes trials, but they assisted the democratic elements, which were latent in Germany, to slowly develop and to come out. We did not have the wisdom to do that, as a country, and -- in connection with the United Nations at the time, which 1s a most regrettable thing, and yet it does deal with the thing that started out very well. An inconclusive truce. I suppose the next thing would be what happened in Yugoslavia, and -- beginning in 1991, when military forces of Serbia invaded Bosnia and Croatia, there were atrocities committed on a huge scale and the fact that there had been a Nuremberg trial certainly did help, with respect to the creation of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The war crimes are being studied on a great -- a greatly improved scale, by a number of universities. The -- At American College of Law, here in Washington, it\u2019s a part of the American University, a professor by the name of Diane F. Orentlicher, O-r-e-n-t-l-1-c-h-e-r, is the director of the war crimes research office, and she has led a group which has helped investigate the details of what happened in Yugoslavia and passed them on to the tribunal, because the tribunal didn\u2019t have an adequate staff to do as good a job as it might. And that very creditable work has been appreciated by several of the top prosecutors, including Louise Arbour, A-r-b-o-u-r, and a conference was held at the Washington College of Law School -- the Wa-Washington College of Law, and several of these representatives, the very top ones, from the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, came and participated in that trial, which got fairly good publicity."
