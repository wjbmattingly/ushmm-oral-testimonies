And all the songs that I sing the Holocaust came to life because I saw the place where everything really happened. So I came back feeling very, very -- very emotional about the Holocaust survivors from Salonika, Greece, Turkey, Balkans. And I have a prayer, and I wanted to light a candle because the memorial at the Auschwitz was to -- to ma -- to -- in memory of these victims. So I wanted -- so I called a day before, I -- so it\u2019s too late, nobody called, nobody wants anything Sephardic, let me do something about it. So I called and I said, I don\u2019t want a concert. I had enough of that. I want a prayer and light a candle for these survivors. Two minutes. I had a plain flat no. And that was one of disappointments that -- that even happens today, you see? I mean, 1-it -- it will never be that I can say, oh I\u2019m so glad my Sephardic music 1s part of the Jewish music. It\u2019s still not accepted. And it\u2019s not that I\u2019m saying well, we died too, and the -- th-the eastern European Jews died, too. [indecipherable]. Many more on that side than here?
