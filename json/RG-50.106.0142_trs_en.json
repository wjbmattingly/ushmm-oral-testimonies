We went there and when we walked to the house they had a little dog, and it was a Spitz, I think, terrier. And you opened the dog and the \u2014 door and the dog jumped up on us and we were frightened to death, a fear that I had until I got my own dogs some many years later.

            "answer": "That\u2019s an interesting question. As far as I know, we were secular. My \u2014 my grandparents, my grandfather was not terribly religious, but my grandmother was, she was quite observant. My aunt, my father\u2019s sister, her name was Selma, was also, I think, religious. She \u2014 she was a spinster and lived with my gran \u2014 my father\u2019s parents. My \u2014 my mother kept a kosher home and as they have told me that during the Hitler years they became more involved with religion than they had been before because they were s \u2014 ostracized by the German community and therefore drew closer to the Jewish community and there was sort of a \u2014 a renaissance of religion during that period of time amongst Jews and they were a part of that. Were they \u2014 and my mother would not have kept a kosher home if it weren\u2019t for my grandparents. She did that for them and for \u2014 for my father and then of course, we were brought up in that fashion until we came to the United States much later, which time all that was \u2014 well, I wouldn\u2019t say all of that was dropped, I think for a few \u2014 a few years here I had religious education, and then we sort of drifted away from the formality of religion, and religion not a terribly important thing in our lives."

And I remember that holiday so well because during the service, the mothers would throw candy down from the balcony, and my brother and I did everything we could to gather up as much of it as we could.

And for any child, of course, Hanukkah was the m \u2014 was a major holiday and that was always celebrated. And one of the things that I do also remember, going to my grandparents\u2019 home, they lived in a \u2014 what I could best describe as a \u2014 looked like a browns \u2014 what a brownstone would look like today. They lived on the lower floors and there was a yard in the back, rectangular yard. It was walled in on three sides, but at the house. And in that little yard, which was just delightful, there was a \u2014 always a sukkah. So on the holiday of Sukkos we would go there and I would marvel at all the interesting things that were hung from the sukkah and the \u2014 and then we went to temple from there, and so those were my recollections really, of the holidays.

My grandparents \u2014 Deutz was the \u2014 where they lived was a \u2014 for I guess going back many hundreds of years must have been kind of a ghetto for Jews, a Jewish \u2014a Jewish area. I -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ghetto in the common sense today, but 1t was an area that was populated mostly by Jews, and the synagogue with \u2014 the Cologne synagogue was there, the \u2014 one of the major ones was right in that area, very near by.

This was for Germans and that Jews were not welcome in these \u2014 in these circles, or at least in this crowd. And although we looked on it with interest, and possibly as a child with longing to be a part of something, we knew that it was beyond us to be able to be a part of it. Just wasn\u2019t possible, and did we feel ostracized by it? I don\u2019t think so, not in that way. I think my feelings were that it would be nice if we could be a part of all of this, but no, it was \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not to be and there was too much fear attendant to trying to be a part of that.

And in those schools, walking home from school, we were often chased by Nazi youth.

So, did I feel German? I knew I was there, I had no sense of nationality, I was perhaps too young to have that sense of nationality. I do know that I was very much interested in geography.

Just to step back, which gives you an idea of the \u2014 the way I became aware of being a Jew, and how unwelcome we really were, not just from what my parents said, but you would go to shops or look, and you would see signs in the store windows, Jews ungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted. And you felt strange going into those shops, although shopkeepers often didn\u2019t care. They \u2014 they welcomed you because they \u2014 you were after all, a client, you were going to spend some money and they would happily sell you things. But the signs, nevertheless were in the windows and in the doors. One in particular I think goes back. We used to go to a beach on the Rhine and my mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself there quite frequently during the summers and we would enjoy bathing in the Rhine.

We were too young for that, but we had the wish to learn how and be a part of that. Anyway, we\u2019d go to the \u2014 to the beach quite frequently, and it was a lot of fun. Kids love that, and we loved it. Then one day we went and there was a sign, Juden ungerwurnscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw the sign and my mother pointed it out to us and she went to the proprietor of that beach and se \u2014 and said, what does this mean? I mean, we\u2019ve been coming here for years. Oh, oh, no, it \u2014 she said, this doesn\u2019t apply to you, you can \u2014 you can come, but you know, we have to have these signs. So although we \u2014 we went, the comfort level of going there suddenly went down several s \u2014 degrees \u2014 more than several degrees, quite a lot and we learned at a young age that we were somehow different, that because we were Jews, we were not part of the general public in \u2014 in Germany. We learned it also when we took trips with my parents on weekends to go to \u2014 th-the Rhineland has got many, many interesting historical sites and castles etcetera, which children love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no Jews allowed. We sometimes ignored those signs and sometimes it was a little too uncomfortable and we just went \u2014 did not go there, or my parents chose not to go there. Perhaps they knew where they were serious about not having Jews and where they weren\u2019t.

March 10, 2001 Rhineland were all that much in love with the Hitler era, that administration, and many of them did not agree with what was going on. But nevertheless, they had to live their lives and they did what they were told, as all good Germans did in those days, but still found ways to tolerate the Jews who lived amongst them. Except for a few. Obviously there were always those who were rabid Nazis and who you had to stay out of their way of and \u2014 and for me as a child, particularly the \u2014 the youngsters who were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see Jews to at least taunt them, if not physically assault them. I don\u2019t remember ever being physically assaulted, but we did lead fairly normal lives as children, aside from this discrimination. My brother and I used to \u2014 we found our way to the circus once. When we were supposed to be coming home from school we got on a train and we wanted the circus so badly we hopped aboard a streetcar and went out to the circus. And of course my mother was beside herself, why didn't the boys come home? But those are the kinds of events I think that most children do. You could do this and there was no fear that somebody would harm you and take you away or steal you, or what have you. You could \u2014 we \u2014 we felt no danger in doing those things.

I do think that the religious institutions, the hospitals, the Catholic church recognized, at least from that experience, recognized more that there were customs that other \u2014 others hewed to, and they respected that.

Jews were not allowed to have Gentile maids in their homes. All these things happened and we were \u2014 we either saw it and we were \u2014 or they were \u2014 we were told about those things. And I remember as a youngster my father kept a revolver. And of course this was very exciting for two young boys, we always wanted to see the revolver, and my father showed it to us but he never let us touch it, which was terrible, we wanted to get our hands on it. But one day we took our car and we were visiting our grandparents across the Rhine and my father took that revolver with him and he stopped in the middle of the bridge on the Rhine river. And he took it apart and he started throwing pieces of the gun into the Rhine, one after another. And of course we were curious, why? And we learned that we were \u2014 Jews were not allowed to have weapons and if we did have weapons there would be dire consequences and he was getting rid of it, and that\u2019s it. He was just \u2014 he was not going to let the Germans have it, for sure, so into the Rhine river 1t went. And maybe that was one less gun that was used 1n the war, who knows.

In 1937 - 1938, things got really \u2014 they escalated, they \u2014 the Germans \u2014 the \u2014 the rules and the many laws they put forth against the Jews affected us more and more. My father\u2019s company was taken over. It was a Jewish company to begin with, Lisauer\u2019s(ph), and they \u2014 the Germans appointed a \u2014 a Aryan company to take it over. And the Jews could continue to work there to show them how to operate it. And my father, that\u2019s where my father\u2019s employment was, so he continued to work there. But obviously all opportunity for advancement etcetera was gone. And we knew that too. Then \u2014 it was at that \u2014 during that period of time that my parents said, you know, we can\u2019t continue to live here. Perhaps even earlier. And they started to inquire about how they could get out of Germany. It was very difficult. The quota for America was completely full, it was years to wait to get \u2014 to get to America, but fortunately my father had connections through his business, in England and in Holland. Particularly in Holland he had good friends, we did a lot of business. And so he started making arrangements to get permission to work and live in Holland, while he was still employed in Germany. We started hearing about concentration camps about that time and we knew people who were either living in the neighborhood, or \u2014 or who had come recently from Poland where they had sought refuge in Germany, that the Gestapo came and picked them up and sent them back. And where were they going? This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Everybody knew there were concentration camps. Certainly all the Jews knew. What happened there that time, we didn\u2019t know. They were just taken away. And this was kind of a frightening scenario. My parents, who \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I guess most German Jews who had lived there fo-for many, many years did not fear that they would be taken away one day. It was mostly \u2014 at that time, mostly the immigrants that came into Germany from the east, from \u2014 principally from Poland who were the subject of this. They didn\u2019t \u2014 the Germans just picked them up, put them on a train, sent them out. And one day I was in school and it really brought it home to me. We were in the middle of a class, and suddenly some men walked into the classroom, and they started calling out names of our fellow students, and they said come with us, and took them out. And my brother and I, when we got home that day, we asked our parents, this and this 1s what happened. What happened? And they explained it to us. These were the sons of Polish parents who had settled there and sent their kids to the Jewish school where we were and they had been called by the Gestapo and they had a few hours to get their things and their children together because they were being transported out. This was frightening for a child, you know, to know that you could be in a class, that somebody could come in and order you out, and with your parents you\u2019re going somewhere else.

Some time in 1937 \u2014 1938 it became absolutely clear to my father that they had to get out. And my parents, because of his contacts in Holland, made arrangements to seek permission to work in Holland. And since his company had an office in Amsterdam and he had friends, his business acquaintances were very close friends in Amsterdam, that was a logical place to go. So they \u2014 my father had a \u2014a-\u2014he\u2019s told me these stories. His company was involved in international trading, and as such, they had special permission from the Reichsbank to travel and to make deals in \u2014 abroad. And my father, being a young man at the \u2014 at that time was the one who was assigned that task, to go to Holland and to England, etcetera. And he used this permission, which was in letter form, to travel rather freely. And he would use that for \u2014 to gain permission to enter the -- England or Holland, etcetera. So while he was over there working, he made arrangements to obtain the permission to work in Holland, which he did.

And the Dutch side was \u2014 they were standing, they were wide open, no problem over there, but \u2014 and my father said no, we don\u2019t have anything to declare and they said, how about the boys? Why are you leaving? And my father said to them, well, you know, they -- we have polio in \u2014 in Cologne. And it\u2019s the summer, we want our children to be safe from that, we \u2014 oh, so you have polio in Cologne? Well, that means your children were going to have to get a health certificate, because we can\u2019t let you go across the border. Obviously we can\u2019t allow polio to spread. Course they knew we were Jewish \u2014 Jews, the passports had all been stamped with a J, so they knew. And my father said well, how do I get these permissions to get across to Holland, th-the health certificate? They said oh, you can\u2019t get them, you might just as well go back. And he said no, how can we \u2014 then he insisted. He said, well you have to see the [indecipherable] I guess, the county executive or whatever in that area and he can do it. Well, where can I find him? And he said well, he\u2019s in such and such a town, whatever. And my father took off to get that. In the meantime we stayed there at the border with my mother and they tore our car apart. Literally went through everything to see whether we had anything at all. And as my mother tells 1t, we had \u2014 we had gotten some gifts from some friends or relatives in Switzerland, the coats and hats and my Aunt Selma had put some perfume in the hatband, and they found that, of course, and confiscated it, which made Norbert and I very upset that they would take that away from us.

Let them have it. And we waited for my father to come back. Well, as the story goes, my father told me, he said he went to see him and he was occupied somewhere and insisted he go in and see this county executive, and he walked into his office, and he gave him a quick heil Hitler. And he said, why can\u2019t I go across the border, I have my children, they have \u2014 we have polio in \u2014 in Cologne and they insist on having the certificate. And so the fellow said well, you know, if you don\u2019t mind, you know, they \u2014 they have polio here in Holland. If you don\u2019t object to your children being exposed to that, then why should we, and he signed it, gave it to him. So he came back to the border and there we were, everything had been stripped and taken and it was quite late by then. And the \u2014 the Germans were furious, of course, that he had come up with the certificate, they didn\u2019t want him to \u2014 didn\u2019t want to give him that opportunity that \u2014 to leave. And even though it was very late, the \u2014 and the Dutch border supposedly had closed. So they thought that maybe this was all over, we couldn\u2019t get in any more. And the German said, okay, you can go, with a smirk on their faces, I guess, knowing that the other side was closed. Well, lo and behold, they started drive across and the Dutch opened the border and they said, what was going on there? And they said, you know, we seen a lot of this with Jews.

And we got up and she took us to the window of the hotel and stood us between the drapes so that we could look out on the s \u2014 onto the street. And down below was this noise of shattering glass and \u2014 and we looked down and we saw these uniformed individuals, the brown shirts, throwing rocks into the window of the store that was just across the street from the hotel. And there were others inside the store throwing porcelain and glass out on the street, just piling it up, just heaving it out. And I remember the \u2014 1n the glow of the streetlights, in the yellowish glow of the streetlights and the cobblestone streets and all this stuff just shattering as it hit the floor. And my mother said to me \u2014 sa-said to us, boys, she said, take a look. Never forget what you see here. And of course we wanted to know what was happening and we asked what\u2019s happening, and she said, that\u2019s a Jewish store. One of the finest stores in crystal and everything and they\u2019re just destroying it. Well, we didn\u2019t know \u2014 what we didn\u2019t know was that not just there, but everywhere, this was going on in Germany and this was the night that the synagogues were all burned and the \u2014 what This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

These were things that we learned only afterwards. But we did see the carnage that was taking place across the street from this hotel and down this \u2014 this whole street. And in \u2014 it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think I can ever forget, the image of it is so vivid in my mind, the whole thing, it\u2019s \u2014 1t was the first time in all those years that we actually saw violence. We had seen and we had feared all the other things, but this was true violence. And it \u2014 and you know, I\u2019ve read a lot about these things since then. The Germans claimed afterwards that it was an uprising on the part of the German people against the Jews. Just remembering all those people in uniform, it was no uprising of the people in, I mean it was the \u2014 it was the \u2014 the Hitler youth, the \u2014 the SA, the brown shirts and whoever else wanted to participate in this, did this. Anyway, in the morning my parents took us to vi \u2014 say goodbye to our grandparents, who were just across the river in Cologne. And the grandparents said, my God are you still here? Get out, get out. And then we learned of the carnage that had been happening the rest of the city, and obviously what was happening all over Germany at the time. The synagogue had been burned, the people had been dragged out of their homes and they made fun of them as they \u2014 down the streets and what have you. Elderly people, and \u2014 and they sent us off. They shooed us out, but quickly, and said get out. And so my parents went directly to the train station from there and we got on the train to go to Holland. There were a lot of other Jews on This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Many of them had come from the east, finding their way through. And some of them had, as we found out a few days later, some of them who were actually on their way to emigrate to the United States were also on the train. And the train took off. What we didn\u2019t know, which we learned shortly thereafter is that the Germans has sealed the borders everywhere. And we arrived at the Dutch border. Police boarded the train. All Jews, out of the train. And we were all taken out of the train, all our baggage off the train, put on a cart, a horse drawn cart without a horse, and we were marched to a jail. Best thing I could describe it as, and locked up in a \u2014 in a room. I remember the room vividly, there we-were quite a number of people in that cell. And I remember the green door and the bars on the door and the window and the toilet in the open, which was to be used by everybody there and of course as children having to use the toilet in front of all these people was something we didn\u2019t like, and I remember the-they shielded us when we had to do so. And we were there for a period of time, I\u2019m not sure how long. My father had some papers with him and in \u2014 it\u2014 and he was concerned that the Germans might see those papers and misinterpret them or find them, and he ate them. And for my brother and I, this was a marvel to see. I think maybe made a big impression on us more-so than even going to jail 1s that my father would eat paper.

And apparently this was made known to the German authorities there and they didn\u2019t want to create a situation \u2014 at least we think they didn't want to create a situation where there would become known that they prevented Jews from leaving.

So they decided to let those Jews who had that passage booked, and pay for us to go to Holland to catch that ship, it was sailing from Holland, to go. And my father said, well look, I have my papers for Holland. Didn\u2019t have any passage on that ship or anything like that. And somehow he managed to get us in with this group to go to Holland. And it was just, I think, good fortune. There was a point just before we went into this jail where we \u2014 where my mother and father were told by the \u2014 whoever was leading us to this ersatz concentration camp that they had put up, or that \u2014 this jail where they were going, where they were apparently separating or segregating people, where they were going to put them and what have you, assign them to some rooms. And they said to my parents, they said look, you will go to a concentration camp where you will be safe. Your children will go to an orphanage. And of course the minute Norbert and I heard this \u2014 and I recall that too \u2014 we started to raise the roof because we were not going to be separated from our parents. This was \u2014 we were just, I guess frightened. And I mean, really scared that we might be separated from them. And my mother said, children calm down. Nobody is going to separate us from anybody.

And she made it known, she was very distinct about it, and she always carried a \u2014 through her lifetime she always carried a paring knife, which she used to peel apples, cause she loved apples.

And it wasn't so strange, because there were people who attempted suicide in that jail because they had lost everything, they knew they were going to be sent to a concentration camp, back where they came from. And there were any number of suicide attempts, some of them perhaps successful, I don\u2019t know. Anyway, that was \u2014 in that moment, I don\u2019t know what made the Germans say forget about it, or go on with your \u2014 the way I heard it my mother said, go on, take your brats and get out of here. I\u2019m not sure that that was the case, cause I don\u2019t remember that, but 1t could very well have been.

But they managed to get them to Holland, and they had an apartment in Amsterdam, not too far from where we lived. My brother and I used to bicycle down to their place. As a matter of fact, a-about 10 years ago it 1s now that I was in Amsterdam, I went to see where we lived, which I r-re-remembered.

But they had \u2014 my parents, during the time that they were in Germany had applied for visas to come to America as did practically every Jew in Germany. And the likelihood of that happening was extremely, extremely slim. It was a lottery system and \u2014 and when he \u2014 and when they wound up in Holland, my father said you know, I\u2019m going to contact the American embassy in Stuttgart and we will have our files transferred to Rotterdam. After all, we\u2019re now in Holland, doesn\u2019t do us any good to have that file in Stuttgart, why not? So he wrote them a letter and he got the file transferred over there.

There were a lot of people who just couldn\u2019t, even when their number came up for a visa, couldn\u2019t accept it any more cause they\u2019d already been transported somewhere else, to the concentration camps, or what have you. And the quota suddenly opened up enough so that one day \u2014 we were in Holland I think for almost a year and a half, two years, close to that. Suddenly he got a call from Rotterdam, Mr. Schnog, bring your family here for a medical exam. If you pass the medical exam you will be able to come to the United States, you\u2019ll get your visa.

And they went to the embassy, we had our physicals, and in two weeks they had a visa to come to the United States. All that excitement, you can well imagine. They started packing up their things and making plans. And because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether they could bring their money out of Holland or whether they had a problem with that, but they decided to book passage first class because they couldn\u2019t do anything else with the money, on Cunard.

One of the things that was so interesting in Holland, so many things happened, as a child this would be interesting, apparently we had a friend, I don\u2019t know whether he was an immigrant from Germany or what, and we were very much into cars, my brother and I. My father at one time in Germany had owned a \u2014 a lot, a car lot where people would bring their old cars and he would disassemble them for the metals, the copper and the \u2014all the precious metals that were inside and sell the rest of it off as scrap. And my brother and I often went there and played in the old cars, you know. We\u2019d climb into the cabs and turn the wheels. It was a lot of fun, very enjoyable. So cars were a passion for us, we could recognize every automobile on the streets, what it looked like, whether it was an Opal or whether it was a \u2014 a Ford or a Volkswagen or whatever, we knew it all. And in Holland this man came over and he \u2014 was a brand new car, I think it must have been a Nash or something like that, as I recall and it was a very modern styling for that time and my brother and I were so impressed. Well it turned out this fellow had stolen the car and it wasn\u2019t long before they caught him and I guess put him in jail, I hope in Holland, not in Germany, but they \u2014 they did.

And they sent me out to purchase a bulb for a flashlight, because he needed it at night, everything was blacked out. And they said okay, now you go down Regent Street right here and down a few blocks and you walk into a store, it\u2019s about a block down and you go ask for a light bulb. Of course, they told me this in Dutch. And I said, well what\u2019s that in English? And they said, well we\u2019ll look it up for you. And they looked it up and they said, well you ask for a bulb. I said bulb? And she \u2014 yeah. And off I went, I couldn\u2019t speak a word of English.

And they were, as my mother said, very decent people caught up in this horror story with the Germans, they \u2014 many of them couldn\u2019t do anything out of fear that something would happen to them. Indeed, my father tells the story about a man who couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut, he says, and he lived in Deutz near my grandparents. He was Christian, he hated the Nazis. He let everybody know that these \u2014 Hitler and these Nazis would ruin Germany. And what\u2019d they do? They caught him, they cut his head off. So that kind of terror visited on a population brings about so much fear, that people shrink away. No wonder they put signs in their windows, no Jews. If they didn\u2019t, God knows what would have happened to them, in their own minds. So there were a lot of \u2014 a lot of Germans who didn\u2019t willingly participate in this, who did so I think out of fear, and what reprisals might be visited on them. There were some of course, who went right along with it, who \u2014 who thought Hitler was the last word and you know, this is \u2014 this 1s the new Siegfried, the \u2014 the hero of German mythology is going to \u2014 th-the vag \u2014 the Wagner people, all this romanticism that really isn\u2019t romanticism, it\u2019s just pure Germanic.

World War II, yes, had every meaning. I was too closely involved. You know, look at our children today.

So, as I say, we volunteered to go along with them, and we went into Berlin and we had a German guide, a young woman, very knowledgeable, who took us around and showed us the highlights in Berlin and the tour. And the tour a \u2014 the centerpiece of the tour was going to see Checkpoint Charlie, and what used to be East Germany and the wall, this small section that they preserved for histo \u2014 for history. And very little was remembered by the guide of \u2014 or was told to any of us about World War II and what happened in Berlin during that period of time, period of years. It was interesting observation for me, because the young Germans were more \u2014 much more affected, and understandably so, by the separ \u2014 the \u2014 the separation of east and the \u2014 Germany and West Germany and the hardships that the eastern Germany \u2014 Germans experienced, and the fact that they were separated from their families and couldn\u2019t see each other, and the \u2014 the wall and the suicides that resulted from that, or people who were killed trying to escape.

She told us, the guide, that she was taking us to the university in Berlin. And we got out and there was this very large square, quadrangle in the center of the university. And we marched out to the middle of this square and mostly cobblestones and in the middle was a square. I don\u2019t know, I would say it was the size of, oh, maybe three meters by three meters, so about \u2014 roughly about thr \u2014 a little more than three yards by three yards square, and glass, right in the ground. You kn \u2014 you know, it was part of the \u2014 the ground, it wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t raised in any fashion. And she gathered everybody around this glass square that was cut into the ground and she said, would you please look down and tell me what you see? And we looked down and what we could see under the glass were empty bookcases around the square and she asked whether we knew what that was. And of course being all Jews, many of us did know exactly what it was. It\u2019s a representation and a memorial of the book burning, where the Nazis had burned all the books. An \u2014 and that that would be there in \u2014 at the University of Berlin, well I thought was extremely interesting. The fact that she knew about it and that she was willing to tell us about it, even though it was not on her tour and that she wasn\u2019t expected to show us this, was very interesting for us. Then we wound up \u2014 which they clearly avoided because they saved it for the last part of the day, we wound up at the Jewish synagogue there, which was burned by the Germans, probably on Kristallnacht, and \u2014 and restored.

But we stood outside. There\u2019s a museum right next door to it where we could go in for a few minutes and see what there was, we really didn\u2019t have much time. But there were two plaques on the outside of the synagogue explaining what had happened and how it was restored, etcetera. And most of my fellow cruise members couldn\u2019t read German etcetera, so I wound up being the one who read the plaques for them and translated it for them, and they were quite moved by it. And I was pleased to be able to open their eyes to this and to be able to read them. Now I think they were, strangely enough, more affected by it than I was, because I had been through it, I had seen it. I think it was more of a shock to most of these people this actually happened and that this is where it took place and these are the \u2014 the memorials to it. So I\u2014I found that trip very enlightening and I guess more so from the point of youth that the Germans today are, just like everybody else in the world, they are obsessed with the history of today and not with the history of yesterday."

But I went to see my father and I said dad, you know, can you get me a job with your company? I want to get into sales or something where I deal with people. And just to see whether I like that. I can always go back to engineering. And he said sure, and he got me a job. I essentially went to work for my father\u2019s company. My brother, who graduated Cornell as an electrical engineer as I did, was pretty close to being top in his class. I \u2014 I was, I guess, the goof off and he was the one who a-applied himself. Not only did he apply himself, he had a calling for engineering. He was a lot like my father, my father always wanted to be an engineer and never had the opportunity. My brother had the opportunity and made the most of it. He immediately went to work as an engineer when he got out of the army and wound up in the \u2014 in the optics field in engineering. Interestingly enough, one of the highlights of his career was that he testified before Congress.

And he was selling all his scrap to a competitor. And so I went in to see him \u2014 Leroy was his name. And I said \u2014 I introduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I\u2019d like to buy your scrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this 1s what I\u2019m ready to pay for it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what have you. And then I had made my pitch, I said, what do you think? And he didn\u2019t answer. He just sat there. And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say something, or shouldn\u2019t I? And I said, you know, I\u2019ve just said everything that I need to say. If he\u2019s not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit. For once in your lifetime, don\u2019t say anything. So I sat there what was an interminable amount of time and I don\u2019t know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which 1s ridiculous, you know, you\u2019re sitting there and you\u2019re wondering what you\u2019re going to do, and beginning to sweat. Should I get up and leave, what? And he suddenly said, yup, okay. Now, I don\u2019t know what he was thinking about, I have no idea. And I won\u2019t ever question it. But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the order and that was that. So I learned a lot from that experience. I stayed with that company, I wasn\u2019t happy there in New England, and moved back to New York and met Ben Livingston, who was an elderly man, was my father\u2019s partner for some years. And we \u2014 and I got into the import and export business in \u2014 in \u2014 in steel. It was in the new steel business. And in 1962 he retired from the company.

He was in his 70\u2019s, but wanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same way today and I\u2019m probably about the same age he was when he retired. And so, with my father\u2019s help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and we Said, let\u2019s go out in business and start the business. And I figured that Ben Livingston had a good reputation in the field. If he stayed active in the business for just three years, we\u2019d have enough grounding in order to be able to \u2014 to run the business without him. Well, we did. We went out, found a small office in the Lincoln building in New York and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of mine and Ben Livingston, the younger associate. And we started to build the company. And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was as \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 he was \u2014 h-he lived until he was 89 years old. He came into the office every single day. He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very close friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back and forth f-for \u2014 for many years. We \u2014 I finally took over as the president of the company and it was extremely successful, 1t worked out quite well. Into \u2014 one of the interesting incidents I\u2019Il never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80\u2019s already and found it difficult to get around. He was using a cane. He was a big man, heavy, and he would start losing some of his agility.

And half an hour passed and the lights didn\u2019t come back on. And I said, you know, something\u2019s going on. We called up and we found out the whole east coast was blacked out. I don\u2019t know whether you remember the big blackout. And I said Ben, I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to get home. The trains aren\u2019t running, everything is closed down.

You know, people didn\u2019t know what was happening, it was the height of the Cold War, people thought that the Russians were sending missiles over and bombing America and we were going to be attacked any moment, and there were all kinds of fears everywhere. People were praying, it was just unbelievable what was happening in New York City. And we were walking up Fifth Avenue, straight up Fifth Avenue. And Ben got pretty tired.

And finally Ben said okay, I think I\u2019m up to going a little bit further. And we marched from there the next 10 blocks to get up to the Harmony Club. We walked in and he said, come on up to the second floor. We went up to the second floor, wherever it was and there were these huge leather chairs. And we just plopped down and he said okay, now what will you drink? And we had some scotch and really just enjoyed that evening.

There\u2019s a group in the \u2014 in Africa, when one ethnic group tries to annihilate another, sure they think they\u2019re better than they are, but they don\u2019t try to set themselves up as a super race, as somebody that could dominate the world, and the Germans always managed to do that, or they have in the last 150 years anyway. Or maybe not so right now, but they did before that. And so this militarism that I saw there and experienced there, I think is unique, or was, at least in my view, was unique to Germany."

My son I don\u2019t think really thinks about it. He knows that his grandparents came from Germany, that they left on Kristallnacht and that they had to get out and that many of the family was caught up in the Holocaust and lost their lives. But I\u2019ve never questioned him about it, how he things about it, and maybe I should, but maybe it\u2019s a failure of parenting on my part, that this is not such an important thing in his life or such an important thing in the grandchildren\u2019s lives. I\u2019d like to make it that way but I\u2019m not sure that you can. I really don\u2019t think you can.

It\u2019s a culture that has, the American culture has \u2014 has gone all over the world, much, much more so than it was when I was in Germany. So we Americanized the world.

You angry about that?",

There are many Americans who have gone through very traumatic experiences of their own. May not be of the s-same nature, but certainly they \u2014 not everybody lives an I \u2014 an idealistic life, they have their own \u2014 they have problems, etcetera, and they \u2014 they\u2019re very meaning \u2014 meaningful in their lives, just like my adventures in Germany, and my leaving was very meaningful in mine.

These were \u2014 that it was happening was probably very good for America, that it \u2014 that all this existed, that that kind of discrimination existed here was not a surprise to me because I had known it existed, and here a country was going through it and was purging itself of it, hopefully. You see, I think the difference between American society and German society is that in Germany under Hitler, institutionalized discrimination and hate and made it a government policy. I don\u2019t think that can happen here, not under our Constitution and under our laws. And not only can\u2019t it happen here, the country was founded on the basis of exactly not allowing that sort of thing. The Constitution was written with this in mind, by people who were very farsighted, many years ago. This wasn\u2019t the case in Germany.

We can\u2019t make peace with our neighbors in the Middle East, which is a sad, sad state of affairs. I\u2019m concerned that there will never be peace in the Middle East. There are just too many hatreds dating back too many years that these things cannot be forgotten by the people who are involved in it, for them. For the Palestinians, this is their Holocaust.

You know, we can blame each other back and forth for a thousand things and find all kinds of excuses why it isn\u2019t done, but some \u2014 somewhere, somebody has to sit down with somebody in th other side and they have to talk sense to each other.
