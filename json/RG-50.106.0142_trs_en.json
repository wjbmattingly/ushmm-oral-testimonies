We went there and when we walked to the house they had a little dog, and it was a Spitz, I think, terrier. And you opened the dog and the \u2014 door and the dog jumped up on us and we were frightened to death, a fear that I had until I got my own dogs some many years later.

            "answer": "That\u2019s an interesting question. As far as I know, we were secular. My \u2014 my grandparents, my grandfather was not terribly religious, but my grandmother was, she was quite observant. My aunt, my father\u2019s sister, her name was Selma, was also, I think, religious. She \u2014 she was a spinster and lived with my gran \u2014 my father\u2019s parents. My \u2014 my mother kept a kosher home and as they have told me that during the Hitler years they became more involved with religion than they had been before because they were s \u2014 ostracized by the German community and therefore drew closer to the Jewish community and there was sort of a \u2014 a renaissance of religion during that period of time amongst Jews and they were a part of that. Were they \u2014 and my mother would not have kept a kosher home if it weren\u2019t for my grandparents. She did that for them and for \u2014 for my father and then of course, we were brought up in that fashion until we came to the United States much later, which time all that was \u2014 well, I wouldn\u2019t say all of that was dropped, I think for a few \u2014 a few years here I had religious education, and then we sort of drifted away from the formality of religion, and religion not a terribly important thing in our lives."

And for any child, of course, Hanukkah was the m \u2014 was a major holiday and that was always celebrated. And one of the things that I do also remember, going to my grandparents\u2019 home, they lived in a \u2014 what I could best describe as a \u2014 looked like a browns \u2014 what a brownstone would look like today. They lived on the lower floors and there was a yard in the back, rectangular yard. It was walled in on three sides, but at the house. And in that little yard, which was just delightful, there was a \u2014 always a sukkah. So on the holiday of Sukkos we would go there and I would marvel at all the interesting things that were hung from the sukkah and the \u2014 and then we went to temple from there, and so those were my recollections really, of the holidays.

My grandparents \u2014 Deutz was the \u2014 where they lived was a \u2014 for I guess going back many hundreds of years must have been kind of a ghetto for Jews, a Jewish \u2014a Jewish area. I -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ghetto in the common sense today, but 1t was an area that was populated mostly by Jews, and the synagogue with \u2014 the Cologne synagogue was there, the \u2014 one of the major ones was right in that area, very near by.

We would look out of the window on \u2014 particularly on weekends and all kinds of interesting things happened. Hot air balloons would be \u2014 would be launched from there, and of course there were a multitude of parades, with military music and the \u2014 and the Nazi youth and all of that, which was for a child at least, an eye opener, interesting to see.

And we were \u2014 it was there, we felt totally apart from it. We felt as though we were not welcome to join it. This was for Germans and that Jews were not welcome in these \u2014 in these circles, or at least in this crowd. And although we looked on it with interest, and possibly as a child with longing to be a part of something, we knew that it was beyond us to be able to be a part of it. Just wasn\u2019t possible, and did we feel ostracized by it? I don\u2019t think so, not in that way. I think my feelings were that it would be nice if we could be a part of all of this, but no, it was \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not to be and there was too much fear attendant to trying to be a part of that.

And in those schools, walking home from school, we were often chased by Nazi youth. We made it our business to stay out of their way as much as we could because we knew that they would taunt us as we went from school back to home. But it didn\u2019t happen all that frequently, just, you know, once \u2014 oh, it\u2019s so difficult for me to remember how often, but it did \u2014 1t \u2014 all that has to do is happen once and you remember it, as a child.

            "question": "You \u2014 you used the expression Germans and Jews. Did you not feel German in any way\u201d?",
            "answer": "I didn\u2019t have a sense of nationality, not at that age. I kn-knew we lived in \u2014 in the country that we lived in, which was Germany, Deutschland, that was our country, but my association was that we were really not a part of 1t because of our Jewishness. My parents I don\u2019t think had that feeling so much. They felt themselves as being German. And \u2014 but they made it clear to us how unwelcome the Jews were and I \u2014 there were other incidents that I can relate to you where I was \u2014 where I recall how they tried to d\u2014to keep Jews out. So, did I feel German? I knew I was there, I had no sense of nationality, I was perhaps too young to have that sense of nationality. I do know that I was very much interested in geography. My parents spoke often of America and Interview with Alfred Schnog , March 10, 2001 that was very interesting for us. You know, where is America and what is happening there, and why is it so great, and \u2014 because they made it sound very, very interesting, etcetera. And then we learned ab \u2014 all about \u2014 my father was \u2014 tr-traveled a lot. So when he was abroad and he \u2014 all those years, even during the Nazi period, he was traveling in Great Britain and in Holland and he told us about his trips. And this was all very fascinating for us. So, we were in \u2014 I never really had a \u2014 you \u2014 to get back to your original question, I never had a sense of nationality at the time. Fascinating interest with the world and different countries, but no sense of nationalism."

            "question": "What language did you speak at home?",
            "answer": "We spoke German. That was the only language that we knew. Just to step back, which gives you an idea of the \u2014 the way I became aware of being a Jew, and how unwelcome we really were, not just from what my parents said, but you would go to shops or look, and you would see signs in the store windows, Jews ungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted. And you felt strange going into those shops, although shopkeepers often didn\u2019t care. They \u2014 they welcomed you because they \u2014 you were after all, a client, you were going to spend some money and they would happily sell you things. But the signs, nevertheless were in the windows and in the doors. One in particular I think goes back. We used to go to a beach on the Rhine and my mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself there quite frequently during the summers and we would enjoy bathing in the Rhine. I wanted to learn how to swim. Interview with Alfred Schnog \u201d March 10, 2001 The interesting thing is how they taught swimming in those days, they put the student on a long string attached to its waist and on a pole and just held them there in the water so that they\u2019d learn how to swim. We were too young for that, but we had the wish to learn how and be a part of that. Anyway, we\u2019d go to the \u2014 to the beach quite frequently, and it was a lot of fun. Kids love that, and we loved it. Then one day we went and there was a sign, Juden ungerwurnscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw the sign and my mother pointed it out to us and she went to the proprietor of that beach and se \u2014 and said, what does this mean? I mean, we\u2019ve been coming here for years. Oh, oh, no, it \u2014 she said, this doesn\u2019t apply to you, you can \u2014 you can come, but you know, we have to have these signs. So although we \u2014 we went, the comfort level of going there suddenly went down several s \u2014 degrees \u2014 more than several degrees, quite a lot and we learned at a young age that we were somehow different, that because we were Jews, we were not part of the general public in \u2014 in Germany. We learned it also when we took trips with my parents on weekends to go to \u2014 th-the Rhineland has got many, many interesting historical sites and castles etcetera, which children love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no Jews allowed. We sometimes ignored those signs and sometimes it was a little too uncomfortable and we just went \u2014 did not go there, or my parents chose not to go there. Perhaps they knew where they were serious about not having Jews and where they weren\u2019t. The Rhineland overall was not \u2014 I don\u2019t think the people in the Interview with Alfred Schnog . March 10, 2001 Rhineland were all that much in love with the Hitler era, that administration, and many of them did not agree with what was going on. But nevertheless, they had to live their lives and they did what they were told, as all good Germans did in those days, but still found ways to tolerate the Jews who lived amongst them. Except for a few. Obviously there were always those who were rabid Nazis and who you had to stay out of their way of and \u2014 and for me as a child, particularly the \u2014 the youngsters who were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see Jews to at least taunt them, if not physically assault them. I don\u2019t remember ever being physically assaulted, but we did lead fairly normal lives as children, aside from this discrimination. My brother and I used to \u2014 we found our way to the circus once. When we were supposed to be coming home from school we got on a train and we wanted the circus so badly we hopped aboard a streetcar and went out to the circus. And of course my mother was beside herself, why didn't the boys come home? But those are the kinds of events I think that most children do. You could do this and there was no fear that somebody would harm you and take you away or steal you, or what have you. You could \u2014 we \u2014 we felt no danger in doing those things. Perhaps my parents were concerned, but my brother and I were not. Then of course, things got a little bit more dicey and \u2014"

            "answer": "No, no, no, by no means. I think we were rather normal in many ways. One of the things that I remember those \u2014 those years, was that it was always difficult for my parents to get all the things they needed in the store. Things were in short supply, particularly things like milk, eggs, all kinds of foodstuffs. Germany was not well supplied in those things and there were always shortages and of course we depended on the goodwill of the Christian shopkeepers, or the German shopkeepers and they \u2014 Interview with Alfred Schnog i. March 10, 2001 as I said before, there were always those who made it their business to help out and we found that \u2014 my mother always found means to bring in what we needed to subsist on and all \u2014 often \u2014 I-I don\u2019t remember us starving, I don\u2019t remember us having any difficulty in \u2014 in getting the things, the substance that we need \u2014 the subsistence things that we needed. I do know, I remember my mother talking about how har -- difficult it was to get these things, and there was one event that I guess epitomizes, that we went \u2014 we were going to go to my grandparents in Deutz and we \u2014my father loaded us in the car and he had gotten \u2014 apparently in \u2014 in Deutz my grandparents couldn\u2019t get all the food that they wanted and he had gotten some fresh eggs, which were also in very short supply, he got them in our area, or through his friends there. And we had set off and shortly, I think, before or after we got to the bridge that goes across the Rhine to Deutz, a \u2014 another car sides \u2014 hit us from the side. It was a major blow and I wound up with a cut on my leg and wound up in the hospital, my mother wound up in the hospital with a cut on her scalp. And the only ones who really got free from it \u2014 Norbert also wound up with something, but not very much. My father was not injured. But during the time, he was so concerned \u2014 you know how nervous one gets when something like that happens, his first thought was oh my gosh, the eggs. And he picked them up and he put them in his pocket. And of course they were all smashed in his pocket. But that gives you the idea of how scarce these foodstuffs were, that he would think of that in a m \u2014 in a moment of Interview with Alfred Schnog - March 10, 2001 panic or trauma, to save those eggs to get them to the grandparents, which was the important thing. And we wound up in the hospital at that time, 1n a Catholic hospital, and it was Passover, and I remember the \u2014 the nuns in white habit and also in black habit coming, taking care of us and they were very, very nice, we had a doctor, an- and I needed some stitches in my leg and it was all done. When they brought up the food, of course, it \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to eat it. It was Passover, we were taught that Passover has to be kosher and it has to be matzoh etcetera, so I s \u2014 spoke up and I said that to the nuns, and they understood it completely and took care of us and brought us what we \u2014 what we would need for that. I do think that the religious institutions, the hospitals, the Catholic church recognized, at least from that experience, recognized more that there were customs that other \u2014 others hewed to, and they respected that. I think they respected any type of religion, as long as it was religion. And so I\u2019ve \u2014 I did not feel that we were badly cared for because we were Jews, it was \u2014 certainly didn -- didn\u2019t have that feeling at that time."

This is the way we were. We knew this when we were young, and so when we saw the signs on the wall, it was just an affirmation of exactly what we already knew or what our parents had already told us. They certainly didn\u2019t hide it. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B"

            "answer": "My parents told us. They were very open. We had a household that was \u2014 they kept nothing from us. They assured us of our security and we relied on them for that, and believed that, but they also told us what was happening. They told us of many of the people who had been persecuted who were Jews, who \u2014 and there was a lot of persecution, there were people who lost their jobs because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t work any longer. Jews were not allowed to have Gentile maids in their homes. All these things happened and we were \u2014 we either saw it and we were \u2014 or they were \u2014 we were told about those things. And I remember as a youngster my father kept a revolver. And of course this was very exciting for two young boys, we always wanted to see the revolver, and my father showed it to us but he never let us touch it, which was terrible, we wanted to get our hands on it. But one day we took our car and we were visiting our grandparents across the Rhine and my father took that revolver with him and he stopped in the middle of the bridge on the Rhine river. And he took it apart and he started throwing pieces of the gun into the Rhine, one after another. And of course we were curious, why? And we learned that we were \u2014 Jews were not allowed to have weapons and if we did have weapons there would be dire consequences and he was getting rid of it, and that\u2019s it. He was just \u2014 he was not going to let the Germans have it, for sure, so into the Rhine river 1t went. And maybe that was one less gun that was used 1n the war, who knows. So we \u2014 we knew, and Interview with Alfred Schnog u March 10, 2001 we grew up with that, and we went \u2014 and when we went to school we \u2014 we knew we were in a Jewish school, we knew we had friends, obviously, in the Jewish school. In 1937 - 1938, things got really \u2014 they escalated, they \u2014 the Germans \u2014 the \u2014 the rules and the many laws they put forth against the Jews affected us more and more. My father\u2019s company was taken over. It was a Jewish company to begin with, Lisauer\u2019s(ph), and they \u2014 the Germans appointed a \u2014 a Aryan company to take it over. And the Jews could continue to work there to show them how to operate it. And my father, that\u2019s where my father\u2019s employment was, so he continued to work there. But obviously all opportunity for advancement etcetera was gone. And we knew that too. Then \u2014 it was at that \u2014 during that period of time that my parents said, you know, we can\u2019t continue to live here. Perhaps even earlier. And they started to inquire about how they could get out of Germany. It was very difficult. The quota for America was completely full, it was years to wait to get \u2014 to get to America, but fortunately my father had connections through his business, in England and in Holland. Particularly in Holland he had good friends, we did a lot of business. And so he started making arrangements to get permission to work and live in Holland, while he was still employed in Germany. We started hearing about concentration camps about that time and we knew people who were either living in the neighborhood, or \u2014 or who had come recently from Poland where they had sought refuge in Germany, that the Gestapo came and picked them up and sent them back. And where were they going? Interview with Alfred Schnog : March 10, 2001 They were going to concentration camps. Everybody knew there were concentration camps. Certainly all the Jews knew. What happened there that time, we didn\u2019t know. They were just taken away. And this was kind of a frightening scenario. My parents, who \u2014 I \u2014I\u2014I guess most German Jews who had lived there fo-for many, many years did not fear that they would be taken away one day. It was mostly \u2014 at that time, mostly the immigrants that came into Germany from the east, from \u2014 principally from Poland who were the subject of this. They didn\u2019t \u2014 the Germans just picked them up, put them on a train, sent them out. And one day I was in school and it really brought it home to me. We were in the middle of a class, and suddenly some men walked into the classroom, and they started calling out names of our fellow students, and they said come with us, and took them out. And my brother and I, when we got home that day, we asked our parents, this and this 1s what happened. What happened? And they explained it to us. These were the sons of Polish parents who had settled there and sent their kids to the Jewish school where we were and they had been called by the Gestapo and they had a few hours to get their things and their children together because they were being transported out. This was frightening for a child, you know, to know that you could be in a class, that somebody could come in and order you out, and with your parents you\u2019re going somewhere else. You\u2019re going out to some \u2014 someplace, and of course we knew then that they were going to concentration camps, or \u2014 Interview with Alfred Schnog \u00bb March 10, 2001"

That came a little later, when people started wearing the armband. Then you would sense that they were part of the crowd that really hated Jews and made you feel uncomfortable, didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t want anything to do with you, they didn't want you to be part of their lives and so it was a sign that these were \u2014 these were anti-Semites. I guess in our own way we Interview with Alfred Schnog \u201c March 10, 2001 knew that the minute we saw that armband it was \u2014 they were part of that authority in Germany that we feared. Some time in 1937 \u2014 1938 it became absolutely clear to my father that they had to get out. And my parents, because of his contacts in Holland, made arrangements to seek permission to work in Holland. And since his company had an office in Amsterdam and he had friends, his business acquaintances were very close friends in Amsterdam, that was a logical place to go. So they \u2014 my father had a \u2014a-\u2014he\u2019s told me these stories. His company was involved in international trading, and as such, they had special permission from the Reichsbank to travel and to make deals in \u2014 abroad. And my father, being a young man at the \u2014 at that time was the one who was assigned that task, to go to Holland and to England, etcetera. And he used this permission, which was in letter form, to travel rather freely. And he would use that for \u2014 to gain permission to enter the -- England or Holland, etcetera. So while he was over there working, he made arrangements to obtain the permission to work in Holland, which he did. And when he came back they \u2014 and made the final decision that their \u2014 they were leaving, they said well, we have to go to Holland. We have to find a place to live. We have to see what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s take a month or so. We\u2019re going to go and we\u2019re going to make these arrangements, then we\u2019ll come back and wrap up everything we have and bring it to Holland. So in the summer of ni \u2014 of 1938, we went by car and my father had his papers with him, so we got \u2014 arrived at the Dutch border and we were stopped. Now, do you have anything to declare, this ca Interview with Alfred Schnog * March 10, 2001 \u2014 you know, at the German side. And the Dutch side was \u2014 they were standing, they were wide open, no problem over there, but \u2014 and my father said no, we don\u2019t have anything to declare and they said, how about the boys? Why are you leaving? And my father said to them, well, you know, they -- we have polio in \u2014 in Cologne. And it\u2019s the summer, we want our children to be safe from that, we \u2014 oh, so you have polio in Cologne? Well, that means your children were going to have to get a health certificate, because we can\u2019t let you go across the border. Obviously we can\u2019t allow polio to spread. Course they knew we were Jewish \u2014 Jews, the passports had all been stamped with a J, so they knew. And my father said well, how do I get these permissions to get across to Holland, th-the health certificate? They said oh, you can\u2019t get them, you might just as well go back. And he said no, how can we \u2014 then he insisted. He said, well you have to see the [indecipherable] I guess, the county executive or whatever in that area and he can do it. Well, where can I find him? And he said well, he\u2019s in such and such a town, whatever. And my father took off to get that. In the meantime we stayed there at the border with my mother and they tore our car apart. Literally went through everything to see whether we had anything at all. And as my mother tells 1t, we had \u2014 we had gotten some gifts from some friends or relatives in Switzerland, the coats and hats and my Aunt Selma had put some perfume in the hatband, and they found that, of course, and confiscated it, which made Norbert and I very upset that they would take that away from us. And my Interview with Alfred Schnog e March 10, 2001 mother said, don\u2019t you worry about it, whatever it is, we can replace it. Let them have it. And we waited for my father to come back. Well, as the story goes, my father told me, he said he went to see him and he was occupied somewhere and insisted he go in and see this county executive, and he walked into his office, and he gave him a quick heil Hitler. And he said, why can\u2019t I go across the border, I have my children, they have \u2014 we have polio in \u2014 in Cologne and they insist on having the certificate. And so the fellow said well, you know, if you don\u2019t mind, you know, they \u2014 they have polio here in Holland. If you don\u2019t object to your children being exposed to that, then why should we, and he signed it, gave it to him. So he came back to the border and there we were, everything had been stripped and taken and it was quite late by then. And the \u2014 the Germans were furious, of course, that he had come up with the certificate, they didn\u2019t want him to \u2014 didn\u2019t want to give him that opportunity that \u2014 to leave. And even though it was very late, the \u2014 and the Dutch border supposedly had closed. So they thought that maybe this was all over, we couldn\u2019t get in any more. And the German said, okay, you can go, with a smirk on their faces, I guess, knowing that the other side was closed. Well, lo and behold, they started drive across and the Dutch opened the border and they said, what was going on there? And they said, you know, we seen a lot of this with Jews. We kept the border open for you. So the Dutch were extremely decent and wonderful people and we went over and for the next month or Interview with Alfred Schnog ! March 10, 2001 six weeks we stayed in a \u2014 kind of a resort town on the beach, and \u2014 in Holland. Sunfort was the name of the reso \u2014 the \u2014 the beach town."

And down below was this noise of shattering glass and \u2014 and we looked down and we saw these uniformed individuals, the brown shirts, throwing rocks into the window of the store that was just across the street from the hotel. And there were others inside the store throwing porcelain and glass out on the street, just piling it up, just heaving it out. And I remember the \u2014 1n the glow of the streetlights, in the yellowish glow of the streetlights and the cobblestone streets and all this stuff just shattering as it hit the floor. And my mother said to me \u2014 sa-said to us, boys, she said, take a look. Never forget what you see here. And of course we wanted to know what was happening and we asked what\u2019s happening, and she said, that\u2019s a Jewish store. One of the finest stores in crystal and everything and they\u2019re just destroying it. Well, we didn\u2019t know \u2014 what we didn\u2019t know was that not just there, but everywhere, this was going on in Germany and this was the night that the synagogues were all burned and the \u2014 what Interview with Alfred Schnog \" March 10, 2001 we didn\u2019t see, the \u2014 the Jews being rounded up and being ostracized and as they were dragged down the streets and all these things. These were things that we learned only afterwards. But we did see the carnage that was taking place across the street from this hotel and down this \u2014 this whole street. And in \u2014 it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think I can ever forget, the image of it is so vivid in my mind, the whole thing, it\u2019s \u2014 1t was the first time in all those years that we actually saw violence. We had seen and we had feared all the other things, but this was true violence. And it \u2014 and you know, I\u2019ve read a lot about these things since then. The Germans claimed afterwards that it was an uprising on the part of the German people against the Jews. Just remembering all those people in uniform, it was no uprising of the people in, I mean it was the \u2014 it was the \u2014 the Hitler youth, the \u2014 the SA, the brown shirts and whoever else wanted to participate in this, did this. Anyway, in the morning my parents took us to vi \u2014 say goodbye to our grandparents, who were just across the river in Cologne. And the grandparents said, my God are you still here? Get out, get out. And then we learned of the carnage that had been happening the rest of the city, and obviously what was happening all over Germany at the time. The synagogue had been burned, the people had been dragged out of their homes and they made fun of them as they \u2014 down the streets and what have you. Elderly people, and \u2014 and they sent us off. They shooed us out, but quickly, and said get out. And so my parents went directly to the train station from there and we got on the train to go to Holland. There were a lot of other Jews on Interview with Alfred Schnog \u201d March 10, 2001 the train. Many of them had come from the east, finding their way through. And some of them had, as we found out a few days later, some of them who were actually on their way to emigrate to the United States were also on the train. And the train took off. What we didn\u2019t know, which we learned shortly thereafter is that the Germans has sealed the borders everywhere. And we arrived at the Dutch border. Police boarded the train. All Jews, out of the train. And we were all taken out of the train, all our baggage off the train, put on a cart, a horse drawn cart without a horse, and we were marched to a jail. Best thing I could describe it as, and locked up in a \u2014 in a room. I remember the room vividly, there we-were quite a number of people in that cell. And I remember the green door and the bars on the door and the window and the toilet in the open, which was to be used by everybody there and of course as children having to use the toilet in front of all these people was something we didn\u2019t like, and I remember the-they shielded us when we had to do so. And we were there for a period of time, I\u2019m not sure how long. My father had some papers with him and in \u2014 it\u2014 and he was concerned that the Germans might see those papers and misinterpret them or find them, and he ate them. And for my brother and I, this was a marvel to see. I think maybe made a big impression on us more-so than even going to jail 1s that my father would eat paper. And these are \u2014 it\u2019s funny, the things that you rec-recollect. And sometime within that day or the next day \u2014 it seemed to me it was Interview with Alfred Schnog * March 10, 2001 just one night that we spent there, but my parents have often said it was almost a week, and I don\u2019t recall that. I think it was just \u2014 I think it was just that \u2014 that night."

Some of them were single men and single women, you know, these were groups. Husband and wife maybe, perhaps families as well. And at one point I guess we ha \u2014 my father had an opportunity to speak to the commandant there of \u2014 whoever he was. And he explained to him that he was traveling here on business. He had this document from \u2014 still \u2014 the Reichsbank, and that he had \u2014 was going to Holland to bid on some very important materials which were needed for the \u2014 the war effort in Germany or for the military, and they couldn\u2019t keep us incarcerated because he had to get on with this business. And the man apparently told them well, you know, I have to see \u2014 I \u2014 first thing I have to do 1s feed 3,000 Jews. He said, we'll take care of you after that\u2019s done. But apparently, coincidentally, the \u2014 there was a ship sailing from Holland for the United States which had booked passage for about a thousand Jews who had permission to come to the United States. The Aidam(ph) was the name of the vessel. And apparently this was made known to the German authorities there and they didn\u2019t want to create a situation \u2014 at least we think they didn't want to create a situation where there would become known that they prevented Jews from leaving. It would have been politically unwise, maybe created Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Schnog \u201c March 10, 2001 too much of a public relations problem for them. So they decided to let those Jews who had that passage booked, and pay for us to go to Holland to catch that ship, it was sailing from Holland, to go. And my father said, well look, I have my papers for Holland. Didn\u2019t have any passage on that ship or anything like that. And somehow he managed to get us in with this group to go to Holland. And it was just, I think, good fortune. There was a point just before we went into this jail where we \u2014 where my mother and father were told by the \u2014 whoever was leading us to this ersatz concentration camp that they had put up, or that \u2014 this jail where they were going, where they were apparently separating or segregating people, where they were going to put them and what have you, assign them to some rooms. And they said to my parents, they said look, you will go to a concentration camp where you will be safe. Your children will go to an orphanage. And of course the minute Norbert and I heard this \u2014 and I recall that too \u2014 we started to raise the roof because we were not going to be separated from our parents. This was \u2014 we were just, I guess frightened. And I mean, really scared that we might be separated from them. And my mother said, children calm down. Nobody is going to separate us from anybody. Before that happens, I will take your lives and mine right here. And she made it known, she was very distinct about it, and she always carried a \u2014 through her lifetime she always carried a paring knife, which she used to peel apples, cause she loved apples. And she was fully prepared to take that knife and cut our throats and her own throat so that Interview with Alfred Schnog \u00bb March 10, 2001 that wouldn't happen. And it wasn't so strange, because there were people who attempted suicide in that jail because they had lost everything, they knew they were going to be sent to a concentration camp, back where they came from. And there were any number of suicide attempts, some of them perhaps successful, I don\u2019t know. Anyway, that was \u2014 in that moment, I don\u2019t know what made the Germans say forget about it, or go on with your \u2014 the way I heard it my mother said, go on, take your brats and get out of here. I\u2019m not sure that that was the case, cause I don\u2019t remember that, but 1t could very well have been. And we went \u2014 we were then on the train with all these other people, or we went to the border with all these other people to cross to go into Holland."

My parents were able still, in 1938 - 1939, shortly after they arrived in Holland, to get my parents \u2014 my grandparents out of Germany. Now, we know that they must have left without anything, because \u2014 at least my grandparents must have Interview with Alfred Schnog \" March 10, 2001 left Germany with nothing in their pockets, to speak. We know that \u2014 well, the Germans made the Jews pay for all the damage they \u2014 they caused on Kristallnacht, that\u2019s history. And they weren\u2019t allowed to own property, they weren\u2019t \u2014 things became so oppressive for Jews that my grandfather, I\u2019m sure, sold his house for a pittance at that time because there was nothing else he could do with it. Whether he could every take the money with him to get it out, I don\u2019t know, I have no idea. But they managed to get them to Holland, and they had an apartment in Amsterdam, not too far from where we lived. My brother and I used to bicycle down to their place. As a matter of fact, a-about 10 years ago it 1s now that I was in Amsterdam, I went to see where we lived, which I r-re-remembered. I\u2019ve been there recently too, and I actually took some pictures of that. And I could find my way still, to my grandparents home, it\u2019s so well ingrained in my mind. My parents, the moment they arrived in Holland said well, we\u2019ve got to start thinking about a little \u2014 getting even further away from Germany and finding a \u2014 another place to go because if it can happen there, it can \u2014 might happen here. We just don\u2019t feel secure. It was not just that, it was also, I think for economic reasons. You can imagine all the Jews that wound up in Holland, all seeking employment. And the competition for my father must have been extremely severe. He was the young man who arrived, he got the dirty jobs. He had to do all the traveling, which in many ways was f \u2014 was good, it helped, because he could \u2014 he went to \u2014 to England quite a great deal. Matter of fact, he even \u2014 he even walked into Interview with Alfred Schnog \" March 10, 2001 the foreign office in England, offered his services because he was so much aware of where German industry was and what they needed and what they had to buy, because that was his business, this is what he did. And he ma \u2014 was able later to make use of those connections, when we finally left Holland to come to the United States, he was \u2014 that \u2014 that helped him a great deal. But they had \u2014 my parents, during the time that they were in Germany had applied for visas to come to America as did practically every Jew in Germany. And the likelihood of that happening was extremely, extremely slim. It was a lottery system and \u2014 and when he \u2014 and when they wound up in Holland, my father said you know, I\u2019m going to contact the American embassy in Stuttgart and we will have our files transferred to Rotterdam. After all, we\u2019re now in Holland, doesn\u2019t do us any good to have that file in Stuttgart, why not? So he wrote them a letter and he got the file transferred over there. And I suppose that lot of things came that worked together at that time. There were a lot of people who just couldn\u2019t, even when their number came up for a visa, couldn\u2019t accept it any more cause they\u2019d already been transported somewhere else, to the concentration camps, or what have you. And the quota suddenly opened up enough so that one day \u2014 we were in Holland I think for almost a year and a half, two years, close to that. Suddenly he got a call from Rotterdam, Mr. Schnog, bring your family here for a medical exam. If you pass the medical exam you will be able to come to the United States, you\u2019ll get your visa. So they had to make a decision as to whether to stay \u2014 of course they had Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Schnog * March 10, 2001 jobs and they were well settled in Holland, or whether to leave. And after everything that happened in Germany, and I think also because of the severe competition for jobs in Holland at the time, they decided th-there\u2019s no question about this, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s get out, let\u2019s get as far away from this menace in Germany as we possibly can. And they went to the embassy, we had our physicals, and in two weeks they had a visa to come to the United States. All that excitement, you can well imagine. They started packing up their things and making plans. And because they couldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether they could bring their money out of Holland or whether they had a problem with that, but they decided to book passage first class because they couldn\u2019t do anything else with the money, on Cunard. Cunard White Star line from London, or Liverpool they sail \u2014 sail from, to the United States. And packed up our things, sent them ahead and suddenly we were leaving Holland.

            "answer": "We had seen pictures in magazines. This was mostly what my parents had explained and told us about. It was our imagination working, perhaps overtime. I really don\u2019t think so, I think our imagination had it right. One of the things that was so interesting in Holland, so many things happened, as a child this would be interesting, apparently we had a friend, I don\u2019t know whether he was an immigrant from Germany or what, and we were very much into cars, my brother and I. My father at one time in Germany had owned a \u2014 a lot, a car lot where people would bring their old cars and he would disassemble them for the metals, the copper and the \u2014all the precious metals that were inside and sell the rest of it off as scrap. And my brother and I often went there and played in the old cars, you know. We\u2019d climb into the cabs and turn the wheels. It was a lot of fun, very enjoyable. So cars were a passion for us, we could recognize every automobile on the streets, what it looked like, whether it was an Opal or whether it was a \u2014 a Ford or a Volkswagen or whatever, we knew it all. And in Holland this man came over and he \u2014 was a brand new car, I think it must have been a Nash or something like that, as I recall and it was a very modern styling for that time and my brother and I were so impressed. Well it turned out this fellow had stolen the car and it wasn\u2019t long before they caught him and I guess put him in jail, I hope in Holland, not in Germany, but they \u2014 they did. So there were all these adventures. I remember my mother taking us to the tulip fields, and seeing that. We \u2014 we spent a week or two weeks of vacation sailing in the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Schnog \u201c\u00b0 March 10, 2001 Zuiderzee, which at that time was open to the North Sea, which has since been dammed in. And we were there with some of my parents\u2019 friends and colleagues, acquaintances and we sailed from one town to the \u2014 all around this \u2014 this huge sea. And it was just marvelous and \u2014 you know, and then one of these old Dutch ships with the \u2014 what do you call them, the sideboards that would go down. They didn\u2019t have a keel, so they had sideboards and we would sail all around. My father was a wonderful photographer and he took some beautiful, beautiful pictures of that, some of which I may still have, I\u2019m not sure. They\u2019re very wonderful."

            "answer": "Not a word. Not a word of English. I was fluent in Dutch, I could speak German, of course. And what impressed me about England were the barrage balloons. England being at war, although the air raids had not started, they were flying these barrage balloons over London. They were not more than, I would say 200 yards off the ground, up in the air. So they \u2014 they looked like small blimps floating everywhere. And all the \u2014 at every intersection where the police had a traffic cop or something, their \u2014 their huts were all sandbagged in. And they were on a war footing. And this impressed us, my brother and I. The blackout during the night. Cars driving around without \u2014 with shielded headlights. And \u2014 so I remember that \u2014 that wartime London. And I \u2014I remember my brother getting sick 1n the hotel, he had caught some \u2014 some something. What it was I don\u2019t know. But he was there, maybe it was influenza or Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Schnog . March 10, 2001 something like that, and we were stuck in the hotel. And my parents had to stay with him. My father was out \u2014 would go to the \u2014 to his office there in London, he had friends and etcetera. And they sent me out to purchase a bulb for a flashlight, because he needed it at night, everything was blacked out. And they said okay, now you go down Regent Street right here and down a few blocks and you walk into a store, it\u2019s about a block down and you go ask for a light bulb. Of course, they told me this in Dutch. And I said, well what\u2019s that in English? And they said, well we\u2019ll look it up for you. And they looked it up and they said, well you ask for a bulb. I said bulb? And she \u2014 yeah. And off I went, I couldn\u2019t speak a word of English. And marched down Regent Street, into the store and I asked for a bulb and managed to get it without any difficulty. I think it \u2014 that was a interesting and very formative experience for me. It taught me a little bit of independence, that you could go anywhere, and you didn\u2019t have to be afraid, that you could make yourself understood, no matter what. And \u2014 and for a young \u2014 for a young man that was, I thought, kind of maturing and I came back and we had it. Now, we had to stay, we had to get permission in London to stay a little longer because my brother was ill. And they had booked the passage with Cunard line but they hadn\u2019t \u2014 the ship hadn\u2019t been designated at that time. So my father had to go to the police there to get an extension. And he called his friends at the foreign office at the time and said here, you know, I need to get an extension, can you help me out? He was afraid that they wouldn\u2019t Interview with Alfred Schnog \u201d March 10, 2001 permit it. And they said well, just go to the police, don\u2019t worry about it. Just go in there and ask them. And he went there and they said of course, you know, you don\u2019t have any problems here, you can stay as long as you like. This they didn't understand, or didn\u2019t \u2014 you know, they didn\u2019t expect it. I can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t understand it, they didn\u2019t expect it. They didn\u2019t expect that you could have so much freedom in \u2014 in any country and there wouldn\u2019t be somebody who would say no, you can\u2019t do this or you can\u2019t \u2014 you \u2014 you must have these papers, or you must go back. I\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t stay, you have to go back to where you came from. Not there. And these were very comforting for them. My brother and I didn\u2019t \u2014 really weren\u2019t concerned, cause we weren\u2019t aware that these \u2014 that this might be a problem or that they were \u2014 tha-that my parents were concerned about it. But eventually \u2014 of course my brother got better in about three or four weeks and in March, I guess it was, must have been March, we finally told that the \u2014 we would have the passage on the Cunard White Star liner, the Britannic, and to go to Liverpool on such and such a day and we board \u2014 they didn\u2019t tell us what the name of the ship was because they were afraid that there would be too many \u2014 too much information around and it would get back to the Germans and there was this submarine warfare going on. They didn't want anybody to know what ships were in port and when they would be sailing. So they just said, come to Liverpool and you\u2019ll be on one of the vessels, the ships."

We showed up at Liverpool and we w \u2014 boarded the Britannic, and my father had been told when he booked the passage that they would be traveling in convoy across the Atlantic because of the submarine warfare.

There were \u2014 and this is where it 1s, there were many Jews and people who were traveling in steerage, so to speak, and they couldn\u2019t even visit us.

But we got \u2014 we were told that we would have to have a lifeboat drill almost daily because of the fear of being s \u2014 being attacked by a submarine.

Course, it never came to that, fortunately. But the first day out my father \u2014 we looked around and I was expecting to see this huge convoy of ships going across the ocean and I looked outside and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Schnog \" March 10, 2001 there wasn\u2019t a ship in sight. And my father went to the captain and said, you know, I thought we were traveling convoy, where are all the other ships? And the captain said, oh that\u2019s nonsense, we are so fast we\u2019d outrace any convoy and we\u2019re going across the ocean. And indeed they did. As a matter of fact they zigzagged all the way across the ocean and I could stand on the tail of the ship and see the wake zigzagging across, to throw off any potential torpedo, I guess, that was directed in our \u2014 1\u2014 to \u2014 directed in our direction, so \u2014 and that was the voyage.

There were either just plain restricted, a sign that said restricted, which everybody knew meant no Jews, or churches nearby which meant essentially the same thing. And it came as a \u2014 a Surprise to me, or perhaps not as a surprise because of what we\u2019d been through. But my parents managed to ignore those things and live with it and possibly they could ignore it because they had so much experience in Germany ignoring it. But it left its mark.

And they went and asked about them, and they still were running a grocery store. And they went over there to \u2014 and they looked in the window there, I guess they were running a pastry shop or something like that.

And they were, as my mother said, very decent people caught up in this horror story with the Germans, they \u2014 many of them couldn\u2019t do anything out of fear that something would happen to them.

He let everybody know that these \u2014 Hitler and these Nazis would ruin Germany. And what\u2019d they do? They caught him, they cut his head off. So that kind of terror visited on a population brings about so much fear, that people shrink away. No wonder they put signs in their windows, no Jews.

And she said yeah, yeah, wait a minute, I have something for you. And she brought out a pair of silver cufflinks. She said these \u2014 these will do fine. And I looked at them and I said, yes they will, where\u2019d Dad get these? She said, well, it\u2019s an interesting story, I have to tell you about it. And she said, when your father was young, about to be Bar- Mitzvahed, 13 years old, there was a \u2014 your grandfather, Arnold, rented a room in his house to a German soldier, an officer. And he used that room to entertain his girlfriend. And he was a very nice gentleman and he knew your father was being Bar- Mitzvahed, so he purchased those cufflinks for your father as a Bar-Mitzvah gift. And, she said to me, you\u2019d be interested in knowing the name of that German officer. And I said, yeah, well who was he? She said, his name was von Stauffenberg. And I Interview with Alfred Schnog \" March 10, 2001 star \u2014 I was startled; von Stauffenberg was the general who took part in the assassination attempt against Hitler in the latter stages of the war.

And you can\u2019t help, when you meet one of the older generation, my generation, you can\u2019t help but wonder where they were in those years between \u201938 and \u00b044, what they were doing, whether they took part in any of the atrocities that were visited on the Jews. But you hesitate to ask. Maybe my parents weren\u2019t so afraid. Maybe they did ask, a few times. But I\u2019ve never asked. I\u2019ve met some of the younger people and they don\u2019t really have a recollection of it, and in that case perhaps it\u2019s good for them, for Germany. One of the interesting trips that we recently took, we went a cruise and wound up \u2014 up in the \u2014 in the Baltic. And we would up in Rostock. And there they had a bus trip to Berlin. Well, for the people who were on the cruise, and there were a group of Jewish people on the cruise who wanted to s \u2014 particularly see the synagogue in Berlin. My wife and I didn\u2019t have an overriding interest to do that, but they needed to gather enough people together to \u2014 to put a busload together and we volunteered to join them. And so we went into Berlin. Interview with Alfred Schnog a March 10, 2001 End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B"

            "question": "This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Alfred Schnog. This is tape number three, side B and you were on this trip going into Berlin.",
            "answer": "Right. So, as I say, we volunteered to go along with them, and we went into Berlin and we had a German guide, a young woman, very knowledgeable, who took us around and showed us the highlights in Berlin and the tour. And the tour a \u2014 the centerpiece of the tour was going to see Checkpoint Charlie, and what used to be East Germany and the wall, this small section that they preserved for histo \u2014 for history. And very little was remembered by the guide of \u2014 or was told to any of us about World War II and what happened in Berlin during that period of time, period of years. It was interesting observation for me, because the young Germans were more \u2014 much more affected, and understandably so, by the separ \u2014 the \u2014 the separation of east and the \u2014 Germany and West Germany and the hardships that the eastern Germany \u2014 Germans experienced, and the fact that they were separated from their families and couldn\u2019t see each other, and the \u2014 the wall and the suicides that resulted from that, or people who were killed trying to escape. And this was foremost in their minds, this was how horrible things were during those years. They didn\u2019t look back to World War II and what happened then. That was not part of their being, their Interview with Alfred Schnog \u00b0 March 10, 2001 substance, their \u2014 their memory, and \u2014 except for one instance, which I found highly interesting. She told us, the guide, that she was taking us to the university in Berlin. And we got out and there was this very large square, quadrangle in the center of the university. And we marched out to the middle of this square and mostly cobblestones and in the middle was a square. I don\u2019t know, I would say it was the size of, oh, maybe three meters by three meters, so about \u2014 roughly about thr \u2014 a little more than three yards by three yards square, and glass, right in the ground. You kn \u2014 you know, it was part of the \u2014 the ground, it wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t raised in any fashion. And she gathered everybody around this glass square that was cut into the ground and she said, would you please look down and tell me what you see? And we looked down and what we could see under the glass were empty bookcases around the square and she asked whether we knew what that was. And of course being all Jews, many of us did know exactly what it was. It\u2019s a representation and a memorial of the book burning, where the Nazis had burned all the books. An \u2014 and that that would be there in \u2014 at the University of Berlin, well I thought was extremely interesting. The fact that she knew about it and that she was willing to tell us about it, even though it was not on her tour and that she wasn\u2019t expected to show us this, was very interesting for us. Then we wound up \u2014 which they clearly avoided because they saved it for the last part of the day, we wound up at the Jewish synagogue there, which was burned by the Germans, probably on Kristallnacht, and \u2014 and restored. Now it\u2019s no longer being Interview with Alfred Schnog mc March 10, 2001 used as a Synagogue cause it was violated as religious ground. But we stood outside. There\u2019s a museum right next door to it where we could go in for a few minutes and see what there was, we really didn\u2019t have much time. But there were two plaques on the outside of the synagogue explaining what had happened and how it was restored, etcetera. And most of my fellow cruise members couldn\u2019t read German etcetera, so I wound up being the one who read the plaques for them and translated it for them, and they were quite moved by it. And I was pleased to be able to open their eyes to this and to be able to read them. Now I think they were, strangely enough, more affected by it than I was, because I had been through it, I had seen it. I think it was more of a shock to most of these people this actually happened and that this is where it took place and these are the \u2014 the memorials to it. So I\u2014I found that trip very enlightening and I guess more so from the point of youth that the Germans today are, just like everybody else in the world, they are obsessed with the history of today and not with the history of yesterday."

Well, of course the United States Army doesn\u2019t think in those terms.

My brother was stationed up on the DMZ, the demilitarized zone at the time, and we\u2019d see each other occasionally, I would fly up with friends of mines who were pilots and \u2014 and in \u2014 in the army.

The rats were the size of \u2014 well, pigs. They were huge, and you\u2019d live with them. There were a lot of \u2014 there were a lot of people who had been displaced by the war, a lot of orphans in orphanages, which you know, just tore your heart out. And as soldiers and as officers, we did what we could to help out these orphanages. We collected from our troops and from the re \u2014 other officers to help these people, and they were very grateful, they were \u2014 for everything that we could do there. They\u2019re a tough people, the Koreans, they really are and they manage to survive. But it \u2014 you really \u2014 it was not the kind of service that I expected in the United States Army. I expected, you know, World War II, you\u2019re going to go out, fight, right? But no, no, no, nothing like that.

It really didn\u2019t matter and there were people \u2014 I was \u2014 one of the jobs that was assigned to me, I was a commander of a depot supply company there and one of the other jobs I had was to \u2014 was for the education, I was the education officer for the battalion and we had many, many sergeants, people who had worked their way up through the ranks, who barely had an education above a grade school level. And we furnished them with additional \u2014 with \u2014 with schools and tried to bring them and as well as many of the \u2014 the enlisted men up to at least a grade level or a high school level education. But it didn\u2019t matter how educated they were, they were basically very, very good people, very honest people. I had a group of sergeants who I got along with extremely, extremely well. They did things for me \u2014 at that time there was absolutely no accountability for supplies in the United States Army. And when I was \u2014 when I signed \u2014 when I took over the command of my company, I signed off on things I didn\u2019t know I had, or didn\u2019t know existed and \u2014 and when it finally came time for me to turn the company over to the next officer that would take over, I had to do a \u2014 an inventory really, what th \u2014 what the heck did we have and what did I sign for, and you know, I\u2019m responsible for this, have to sign it back. And there were \u2014 there was a Jeep in there that I remember that I never even knew existed. And \u2014 and we had \u2014 and we had some things that we had so much in excess of that it shouldn\u2019t have been there, but I se \u2014 I said to one of my sergeants, I \u2014 what \u2014 what Interview with Alfred Schnog \" March 10, 2001 are we going to do about this, or where\u2019s this Jeep? He said oh please lieutenant, he said, don\u2019t worry about it, just bring the guy over tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll take care of it. So in the morning I came over with a new officer and I introduced him to my staff and I said okay, would you \u2014 h-here is our inventory, would you sign off on it please? And we start looking around and when he checked it off and we went outside and there is this Jeep sitting there and I look at the inventory list and the serial number, everything 1s just exactly the way it should be. And I said hm, I guess it must have been somewhere, but \u2014 and the fellow signed off and everything was just perfect. And when he left I pulled out a bottle that I had there and I said, look gentlemen, the s \u2014 the sergeants \u2014 well, you know, I guess this is goodbye. I want you to have a drink and \u2014 and we exchanged pleasantries, had a drink and I said, now wait a minute sergeant, I said, where the hell\u2019d that Jeep come from? And he said sir, he said, in about five minutes we have to return it to battalion A, and we\u2019ve got to repaint the thing. So it\u2019s that kind of thing. Everybody would help everybody out."

But I went to see my father and I said dad, you know, can you get me a job with your company? I want to get into sales or something where I deal with people. And just to see whether I like that. I can always go back to engineering. And he said sure, and he got me a job. I essentially went to work for my father\u2019s company. My brother, who graduated Cornell as an electrical engineer as I did, was pretty close to being top in his class. I \u2014 I was, I guess, the goof off and he was the one who a-applied himself.

I \u2014 I think one of the things I learned there was that sometimes it\u2019s good to keep your mouth shut.

And he was selling all his scrap to a competitor. And so I went in to see him \u2014 Leroy was his name. And I said \u2014 I introduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I\u2019d like to buy your scrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this 1s what I\u2019m ready to pay for it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what have you. And then I had made my pitch, I said, what do you think? And he didn\u2019t answer. He just sat there. And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say something, or shouldn\u2019t I? And I said, you know, I\u2019ve just said everything that I need to say. If he\u2019s not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit. For once in your lifetime, don\u2019t say anything. So I sat there what was an interminable amount of time and I don\u2019t know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which 1s ridiculous, you know, you\u2019re sitting there and you\u2019re wondering what you\u2019re going to do, and beginning to sweat. Should I get up and leave, what? And he suddenly said, yup, okay. Now, I don\u2019t know what he was thinking about, I have no idea. And I won\u2019t ever question it. But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the order and that was that. So I learned a lot from that experience. I stayed with that company, I wasn\u2019t happy there in New England, and moved back to New York and met Ben Livingston, who was an elderly man, was my father\u2019s partner for some years. And we \u2014 and I got into the import and export business in \u2014 in \u2014 in steel. It was in the new steel business. And in 1962 he retired from the company. And I know he Interview with Alfred Schnog \u00bb March 10, 2001 was \u2014 he was not happy retiring, he was an active man. He was in his 70\u2019s, but wanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same way today and I\u2019m probably about the same age he was when he retired. And so, with my father\u2019s help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and we Said, let\u2019s go out in business and start the business. And I figured that Ben Livingston had a good reputation in the field. If he stayed active in the business for just three years, we\u2019d have enough grounding in order to be able to \u2014 to run the business without him. Well, we did. We went out, found a small office in the Lincoln building in New York and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of mine and Ben Livingston, the younger associate. And we started to build the company. And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was as \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 he was \u2014 h-he lived until he was 89 years old. He came into the office every single day. He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very close friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back and forth f-for \u2014 for many years. We \u2014 I finally took over as the president of the company and it was extremely successful, 1t worked out quite well. Into \u2014 one of the interesting incidents I\u2019Il never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80\u2019s already and found it difficult to get around. He was using a cane. He was a big man, heavy, and he would start losing some of his agility. And I was in the office talking to him, I was going to take a trip to Argentina, a business trip and I sat down and I told him Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection Interview with Alfred Schnog \" March 10, 2001 what I was going to do, and how we were going to get around, we had a problem there, and discussed the problem with him and how best to solve it. Suddenly the lights went out in the building and we were on the \u2014 that time on the 21 floor of the Lincoln building. And I said okay, let\u2019s sit around, let\u2019s see what happens. And half an hour passed and the lights didn\u2019t come back on. And I said, you know, something\u2019s going on. We called up and we found out the whole east coast was blacked out. I don\u2019t know whether you remember the big blackout. And I said Ben, I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re going to get home. The trains aren\u2019t running, everything is closed down. I just made a telephone call, the whole east coast is blacked out. I don\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t think I can leave you here. And he said well, you know something, I \u2014 if you'll help me I \u2014 let\u2019s go up to my club. He was a memory of the Harmony Club up on Fifth Avenue, which was up on 60\" Street. And I said, all right, come on, I\u20191l help you. And we \u2014 poor fellow, he walked down 21 flights of stairs with his cane, and we started walking uptown. It was an extraordinary night. You know, people didn\u2019t know what was happening, it was the height of the Cold War, people thought that the Russians were sending missiles over and bombing America and we were going to be attacked any moment, and there were all kinds of fears everywhere. People were praying, it was just unbelievable what was happening in New York City. And we were walking up Fifth Avenue, straight up Fifth Avenue. And Ben got pretty tired. We were up near 50\" Street and he was kind of exhausted by this time, and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 there was Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral right there next to us. And I said Ben, you know, why don\u2019t we go inside and sit down, you know, you can use a spell of rest, and I \u2014 and he said you know AI, that\u2019s a good idea, let\u2019s go. So we went to Saint Patrick\u2019s cathe \u2014 Cathedral, which was amazing. It was lit up by candles and people, you know, they were afraid, they didn\u2019t know what was happening and they were praying and 1-it was an extraordinary sight. And we sat down, we just sat and relaxed for awhile until \u2014 and I observed all this, the people crying, people in fear, people not knowing where they were going to go, people just resting like we were. And finally Ben said okay, I think I\u2019m up to going a little bit further. And we marched from there the next 10 blocks to get up to the Harmony Club. We walked in and he said, come on up to the second floor. We went up to the second floor, wherever it was and there were these huge leather chairs. And we just plopped down and he said okay, now what will you drink? And we had some scotch and really just enjoyed that evening. And eventually I think I found my way home by \u2014 I left Ben there, I knew he was taken care of and I found my way home with a group of other guys in a taxi that night.

            "answer": "Yeah, the business was \u2014 went quite well for many, many years and in 1991 we had some very bad luck, we \u2014 we had a \u2014 an operation with, or a \u2014 a joint venture with an organization, we started a company in Puerto Rico with a man who would \u2014 Interview with Alfred Schnog \u2122 March 10, 2001 we thought we could trust and as often these things happen, we couldn\u2019t. The \u2014 the trust was not \u2014 was not well placed, and we lost an awful lot of money na \u2014 in that particular year, so much so that we had to go out of business [indecipherable]. And we joined \u2014 we \u2014 what we wound up doing was set \u2014 discharging our employees, which I think was probably one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever had to do, let people go, tell them that we just couldn\u2019t carry on. And we went \u2014 we joined a \u2014 another organization, Stemcor at the time, whom we sold ourselves to for practically nothing because they didn\u2019t believe we could do anything. So we said okay, we\u2019 ll make a deal with you. Here\u2019s what we want to earn and if we don\u2019t earn it, you don\u2019t pay us anything. So we were at risk and if we lost money we were prepared to make it up to them. And so we went to work for them and it didn\u2019t take very long, we hit it just right and in three years we had recovered practically everything we lost on the other company. It was \u2014 we did exceedingly well. And it came time to renegotiate the contract and we renegotiated it and then \u2014 for two \u2014 for two more years. And then they got kind of jealous by how much we were making, and you know, th-these things happen. We got into arguments about why aren\u2019t you paying us and they wanted to create all kinds of reserves. Well, you \u2014 you \u2014 we\u2019re not going to pay you now and we\u2019ll pay you later and we said no. And after two years we closed that up. Actually, there was a lawsuit that resulted from the \u2014 the closing of the Livingston organization.

You know, I was sick and tired of that \u2014 running into that kind of an argument with him.

They would have said no, a deal\u2019s a deal. Let\u2019s live by it. And so we left Stemcor.

The Germans made a specialty of it, and they did so historically for many, many, many years. I mean, you go back to Bismarck and even back further, the \u2014 the Prussians and their \u2014 y-you can go back to \u2014 to Middle Ages and the \u2014 the Germans and their \u2014 their mythology of \u2014 was always the \u2014 the hero worship and the loyalty to \u2014 to anything but \u2014 but a democratic society.

I\u2019m sure it is in many ways. German philosophy is replete with this sort of thing, of \u2014 of the super race, which 1s what Hitler really played on. I don\u2019t see that elsewhere in the Interview with Alfred Schnog \u201d March 10, 2001 world, I am not seeing it elsewhere in the world. Sure, people think we\u2019re better than you are. There\u2019s a group in the \u2014 in Africa, when one ethnic group tries to annihilate another, sure they think they\u2019re better than they are, but they don\u2019t try to set themselves up as a super race, as somebody that could dominate the world, and the Germans always managed to do that, or they have in the last 150 years anyway. Or maybe not so right now, but they did before that. And so this militarism that I saw there and experienced there, I think is unique, or was, at least in my view, was unique to Germany."
