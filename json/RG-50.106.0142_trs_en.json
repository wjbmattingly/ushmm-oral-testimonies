We went there and when we walked to the house they had a little dog, and it was a Spitz, I think, terrier.

My \u0152 my grandparents, my grandfather was not terri bly religious, but my grandmother was, she was quite observant. My aunt, my father\u2122s sister, her name was Selma, was also, I think, religious. She \u0152 she was a spinster and lived with my gran \u0152 my father\u2122s parents. My \u0152 my mother kept a kosher ho me and as they have told me that during the Hitler years they became more involved with religion than th ey had been before because they were s \u0152 ostracized by the German community and therefore drew closer to the Jewish community and there was sort of a \u0152 a renaissance of religion during that period of time amongst Jews and they were a part of that. Were they \u0152 and my mother would not have kept a kosher home if it we ren\u2122t for my grandparents.

My parents I don\u2122t think had that feeling so mu ch. They felt themselves as being German.

So, did I feel Germ an? I knew I was there, I had no sense of nationality, I was perhaps too young to have that sense of nationality. I do know that I was very much interested in geography.

            "answer": "We spoke German. That was the only language that we knew. Just to step back, which gives you an idea of the \u0152 the way I became aware of being a Jew, and how unwelcome we really were, not just from what my parents said, but you would go to shops or look, and you would see si gns in the store windows, Jews ungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted. And you felt strange going into those shops, although shopkeepers often didn\u2122t care. Th ey \u0152 they welcomed you because they \u0152 you were after all, a client, you were goi ng to spend some money and they would happily sell you things. But the signs, neve rtheless were in the windows and in the doors. One in particular I think goes back. We used to go to a beach on the Rhine and my mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself there quite frequently during the summers and we would enjoy ba thing in the Rhine. I wanted to learn how to swim. Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 10The interesting thing is how they taught sw imming in those days, they put the student on a long string attached to its waist and on a pole and just held them there in the water so that they\u2122d learn how to swim. We were too young for that, but we had the wish to learn how and be a part of that. An yway, we\u2122d go to the \u0152 to the beach quite frequently, and it was a lot of fun. Kids love that, and we loved it. Then one day we went and there was a sign, Juden ungerwur nscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw the sign and my mother pointed it out to us and she went to the proprietor of that beach and se \u0152 and said, what does this mean? I mean, we\u2122ve b een coming here for years. Oh, oh, no, it \u0152 she said, this doesn\u2122t apply to you, yo u can \u0152 you can come, but you know, we have to have these signs. So although we \u0152 we went, the comfort level of going there suddenly went down se veral s \u0152 degrees \u0152 more than several degrees, quite a lot and we learned at a young age that we were somehow different, that because we were Jews, we were not part of the general public in \u0152 in Germany. We learned it also when we took trips with my parents on weekends to go to \u0152 th-the Rhineland has got many, many interesting hi storical sites and castles etcetera, which children love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no Jews allowed. We sometimes ignored thos e signs and sometimes it was a little too uncomfortable and we just we nt \u0152 did not go there, or my parents chose not to go there. Perhaps they knew where they were serious about not having Jews and where they weren\u2122t. The Rhineland overall was not \u0152 I don\u2122t think the people in the Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 11Rhineland were all that much in love with the Hitler era, that administration, and many of them did not agree with what was going on. But nevertheless, they had to live their lives and they did what they we re told, as all good Germans did in those days, but still found ways to tolerate the Jews who lived amongst them. Except for a few. Obviously there were always those who were rabid Nazis and who you had to stay out of their way of and \u0152 and for me as a child, particularly the \u0152 the youngsters who were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see Jews to at least taunt them, if not physically assault them. I don\u2122t remember ever being physically assaulted, but we did lead fairly normal lives as children, aside from this discrimination. My brother and I used to \u0152 we found our way to the circus once. When we were supposed to be coming hom e from school we got on a train and we wanted the circus so badly we hopped aboa rd a streetcar and went out to the circus. And of course my mother was beside hers elf, why didn't the bo ys come home? But those are the kinds of events I think that most children do. You could do this and there was no fear that somebody would harm you and take you away or steal you, or what have you. You could \u0152 we \u0152 we felt no danger in doing those things. Perhaps my parents were concerned, but my brother and I were not. Then of course, things got a little bit more dicey and \u0152"

One of the things that I remember those \u0152 those years, was that it was always difficult for my parents to get all the things they needed in the store. Things were in short supply, particularly things like milk, eggs, all kinds of foodstuffs. Germany was not well supplied in those things and there were always shortages and of course we depended on the goodwill of the Christian shopkeepers, or the German shopkeepers and they \u0152 Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 13as I said before, there were always those who made it their business to help out and we found that \u0152 my mother always found means to bring in what we needed to subsist on and all \u0152 often \u0152 I-I don\u2122t remember us starving, I don\u2122t remember us having any difficulty in \u0152 in getting the th ings, the substance that we need \u0152 the subsistence things that we needed. I do kno w, I remember my mother talking about how har -- difficult it was to get these things, and there was one event that I guess epitomizes, that we went \u0152 we were going to go to my grandparents in Deutz and we \u0152 my father loaded us in the car and he had gotten \u0152 apparently in \u0152 in Deutz my grandparents couldn\u2122t get all the food that they wanted and he had gotten some fresh eggs, which were also in very short supply, he got them in our area, or through his friends there. And we had set off and shortly, I think, before or after we got to the bridge that goes across the Rhine to Deutz, a \u0152 another car sides \u0152 hit us from the side. It was a major blow and I wound up with a cut on my leg and wound up in the hospital, my mother wound up in the hospital with a cut on her scalp. And the only ones who really got free from it \u0152 Norbert also wound up with something, but not very much. My father was not injured. But during the time, he was so concerned \u0152 you know how nervous one ge ts when something like that happens, his first thought was oh my gosh, the eggs. And he picked them up and he put them in his pocket. And of course they were all smashed in hi s pocket. But that gives you the idea of how scarce these foodstuffs were, that he would think of that in a m \u0152 in a moment of Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 14panic or trauma, to save those eggs to ge t them to the grandparents, which was the important thing. And we wound up in the hosp ital at that time, in a Catholic hospital, and it was Passover, and I remember the \u0152 the nuns in white habit and also in black habit coming, taking care of us and they we re very, very nice, we had a doctor, an-and I needed some stitches in my leg a nd it was all done. When they brought up the food, of course, it \u0152 I didn\u2122t want to eat it. It was Passover, we were taught that Passover has to be kosher and it has to be matzoh etcetera, so I s \u0152 spoke up and I said that to the nuns, and they underst ood it completely and took care of us and brought us what we \u0152 what we would need for that. I do think that the religious institutions, the hospitals, the Catholic church recognized, at least from that experience, recognized more that there were customs that other \u0152 others hewed to, and they respected that. I think they respected any type of religi on, as long as it was religion. And so I\u2122ve \u0152 I did not feel that we were badly cared for because we were Jews, it was \u0152 certainly didn -- didn\u2122t have that feeling at that time."

They assured us of ou r security and we relied on them for that, and believed that, but they also told us what was happening. They told us of many of the people who had been persecuted who we re Jews, who \u0152 and there was a lot of persecution, there were people who lost their jobs because they couldn\u2122t \u0152 couldn\u2122t work any longer. Jews were not allowed to have Gentile maids in their homes. All these things happened and we were \u0152 we either saw it and we were \u0152 or they were \u0152 we were told about those things. And I remember as a youngster my father kept a revolver. And of course this was very exciting for two young boys, we always wanted to see the revolver, and my father show ed it to us but he never let us touch it, which was terrible, we wanted to get our hands on it. But one day we took our car and we were visiting our grandparents across the Rhine and my father took that revolver with him and he stop ped in the middle of the br idge on the Rhine river. And he took it apart and he started throwing pieces of the gun into the Rhine, one after another. And of course we were curious, w hy? And we learned th at we were \u0152 Jews were not allowed to have weapons and if we did have weapons there would be dire consequences and he was getting rid of it, and that\u2122s it. He was just \u0152 he was not going to let the Germans have it, for sure, so into the Rhine river it went. And maybe that was one less gun that was used in the war, who knows. So we \u0152 we knew, and Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 17we grew up with that, and we went \u0152 and when we went to school we \u0152 we knew we were in a Jewish school, we knew we had friends, obviously, in the Jewish school.

Then \u0152 it was at that \u0152 during that pe riod of time that my parents said, you know, we can\u2122t continue to live here. Perhaps even earlier. And they started to inquire about how they could get out of Germany. It wa s very difficult. The quota for America was completely full, it was years to wait to get \u0152 to get to America, but fortunately my father had connections through his business, in England and in Holland. Particularly in Holland he had good friends, we did a lo t of business. And so he started making arrangements to get permission to work and live in Holland, while he was still employed in Germany. We started hearing about concentration camps about that time and we knew people who were either livin g in the neighborhood, or \u0152 or who had come recently from Poland where they had sought refuge in Germany, that the Gestapo came and picked them up and sent them back. And where were they going? Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 18They were going to concentr ation camps. Everybody knew there were concentration camps. Certainly all the Jews knew. What ha ppened there that time, we didn\u2122t know. They were just taken away. And this was kind of a frightening scenario. My parents, who \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I guess most German Jews who had lived there fo-for many, many years did not fear that they would be take n away one day. It wa s mostly \u0152 at that time, mostly the immigrants that came into Germany from the east, from \u0152 principally from Poland who were the subject of this. They didn\u2122t \u0152 the Germans just picked them up, put them on a train, sent them out. And one day I was in school and it really brought it home to me. We were in the middle of a class, and suddenly some men walked into the classroom, and they started calling out names of our fellow students, and they said come with us, and took them out. And my brother and I, when we got home that day, we asked our parent s, this and this is what happened. What happened? And they explained it to us. Thes e were the sons of Polish parents who had settled there and sent their kids to the Jewish school where we were and they had been called by the Gestapo and they had a few hours to get their things and their children together because they were being transported out. This was frightening for a child, you know, to know that you could be in a class, that somebody could come in and order you out, and with your parents you\u2122re going somewhere else. You\u2122re going out to some \u0152 someplace, and of course we knew then that they were going to concentration camps, or \u0152 Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 19"

            "answer": "Well, it was a sign of the authority, the German authority, and did it evoke any feelings at that time? I don\u2122t think so, not at that time. That came a little later, when people started wearing the armband. Then yo u would sense that they were part of the crowd that really hated Jews and made yo u feel uncomfortable, didn\u2122t \u0152 they didn\u2122t want anything to do with you, they didn't wa nt you to be part of their lives and so it was a sign that these were \u0152 these were anti-Semites. I guess in our own way we Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 24knew that the minute we saw that armband it was \u0152 they were part of that authority in Germany that we feared. Some time in 1937 \u0152 1938 it became absolutely clear to my father that they had to get out. And my pa rents, because of his contacts in Holland, made arrangements to seek permission to work in Holland. And since his company had an office in Amsterdam and he had frie nds, his business acquaintances were very close friends in Amsterdam, that was a logical place to go. So they \u0152 my father had a \u0152 a \u0152 he\u2122s told me these stories. His comp any was involved in international trading, and as such, they had special permission fro m the Reichsbank to travel and to make deals in \u0152 abroad. And my father, being a young man at the \u0152 at that time was the one who was assigned that task, to go to Holland and to England, etcetera. And he used this permission, which was in letter form, to travel rather freely. And he would use that for \u0152 to gain permission to enter the -- England or Holland, etcetera. So while he was over there working, he made arrangeme nts to obtain the permission to work in Holland, which he did. And when he came back they \u0152 and made the final decision that their \u0152 they were leaving, they said well, we have to go to Holland. We have to find a place to live. We have to see what\u2122s going on, let\u2122s take a month or so. We\u2122re going to go and we\u2122re going to make these a rrangements, then we\u2122ll come back and wrap up everything we have and bring it to Holland. So in the summer of ni \u0152 of 1938, we went by car and my father had his papers with him, so we got \u0152 arrived at the Dutch border and we were stopped. Now, do you have anything to declare, this ca Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 25\u0152 you know, at the German side. And the Dutch side was \u0152 they were standing, they were wide open, no problem over there, but \u0152 and my father said no, we don\u2122t have anything to declare and they said, how about the boys? Why are you leaving? And my father said to them, well, you know, th ey -- we have polio in \u0152 in Cologne. And it\u2122s the summer, we want our children to be safe from that, we \u0152 oh, so you have polio in Cologne? Well, that means your child ren were going to have to get a health certificate, because we can\u2122t let you go acr oss the border. Obviously we can\u2122t allow polio to spread. Course they knew we were Jewish \u0152 Jews, the passports had all been stamped with a J, so they knew. And my father said well, how do I get these permissions to get across to Holland, th-the health certificate? They said oh, you can\u2122t get them, you might just as well go back . And he said no, how can we \u0152 then he insisted. He said, well you have to see the [indecipherable] I guess, the county executive or whatever in that area and he can do it. Well, where can I find him? And he said well, he\u2122s in such and such a town, whatever. And my father took off to get that. In the meantime we stayed there at the border with my mother and they tore our car apart. Literally went through everything to see whether we had anything at all. And as my mother tells it, we had \u0152 we had gotten some gifts from some friends or relatives in Switzerland, the coats and hats and my Aunt Selma had put some perfume in the hatband, and they found that, of course, and confiscated it, which made Norbert and I very upset that they would take that away from us. And my Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 26mother said, don\u2122t you worry about it, whatev er it is, we can replace it. Let them have it. And we waited for my father to come back. Well, as the story goes, my father told me, he said he went to see him and he wa s occupied somewhere and insisted he go in and see this county executive, and he walked into his offi ce, and he gave him a quick heil Hitler. And he said, why can\u2122t I go across the border, I have my children, they have \u0152 we have polio in \u0152 in Cologne and they insist on having the certificate. And so the fellow said well, you know, if you don\u2122t mind, you know, they \u0152 they have polio here in Holland. If you don\u2122t object to your children being expose d to that, then why should we, and he signed it, gave it to him. So he came back to the border and there we were, everything had been stripped an d taken and it was quite late by then. And the \u0152 the Germans were furious, of course, that he had come up with the certificate, they didn\u2122t want him to \u0152 didn\u2122t want to give him that opportunity that \u0152 to leave. And even though it was very late, the \u0152 and the Dutch border supposedly had closed. So they thought that maybe this was all over, we couldn\u2122t get in any more. And the German said, okay, you can go, with a smirk on their faces, I guess, knowing that the other side was closed. Well, lo and behold, they started drive across and the Dutch opened the border and they said, what was go ing on there? And they said, you know, we seen a lot of this with Jews. We kept the border open for y ou. So the Dutch were extremely decent and wonderful people and we went over and for the next month or Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 27six weeks we stayed in a \u0152 kind of a resort town on the beac h, and \u0152 in Holland. Sunfort was the name of the reso \u0152 the \u0152 the beach town."

And we got up and she took us to the window of the hotel and stood us between the drapes so that we could look out on the s \u0152 onto the street. And down below was this noise of shattering glass and \u0152 and we looked down and we saw these uniformed individuals, the brown shirts, th rowing rocks into the window of the store that was just across the street from the hotel. And there were others inside the store throwing porcelain and glass out on the stre et, just piling it up, just heaving it out. And I remember the \u0152 in the glow of the streetlights, in the ye llowish glow of the streetlights and the cobblestone streets and al l this stuff just shattering as it hit the floor. And my mother said to me \u0152 sa-said to us, boys, she said, take a look. Never forget what you see here. And of course we wanted to know what was happening and we asked what\u2122s happening, and she said, th at\u2122s a Jewish store. One of the finest stores in crystal and everything and they\u2122re just destroying it. Well, we didn\u2122t know \u0152 what we didn\u2122t know was that not just there, but everywhere, this was going on in Germany and this was the night that the synagogues were all burned and the \u0152 what Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 31we didn\u2122t see, the \u0152 the Jews being rounded up and being ostracized and as they were dragged down the streets and a ll these things. These were things that we learned only afterwards. But we did see the carnage that was taking place across the street from this hotel and down this \u0152 this whole street. And in \u0152 it\u2122s something that I don\u2122t think I can ever forget, the image of it is so vivid in my mind, the whole thing, it\u2122s \u0152 it was the first time in all those years that we actually saw violence. We had seen and we had feared all the other things, but this was true violence. An d it \u0152 and you know, I\u2122ve read a lot about these things since then. The Germans claimed afterwards that it was an uprising on the part of the German people against the Jews. Just remembering all those people in uniform, it was no uprising of the people in, I mean it was the \u0152 it was the \u0152 the Hitler youth, the \u0152 the SA, the brown shirts and whoever else wanted to participate in this, did this. Anyway, in the morning my pa rents took us to vi \u0152 say goodbye to our grandparents, who were just across the river in Cologne. And the grandparents said, my God are you still here? Get out, get out. And then we learned of the carnage that had been happening the rest of the city, and obviously what was happening all over Germany at the time. Th e synagogue had been burned, the people had been dragged out of their homes and they made fun of them as they \u0152 down the streets and what have you. Elderly people, and \u0152 and they sent us off. They shooed us out, but quickly, and said get out. And so my parents went directly to the train station from there and we got on the train to go to Holland. There were a lot of other Jews on Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 32the train. Many of them had come from th e east, finding their way through. And some of them had, as we found out a few days later, some of them who were actually on their way to emigrate to the United States were also on the train. And the train took off. What we didn\u2122t know, which we learned shortly thereafter is that the Germans has sealed the borders everywhere. And we arrived at the Dutch border. Police boarded the train. All Jews, out of th e train. And we were all taken out of the train, all our baggage off the train, put on a cart, a horse drawn cart without a horse, and we were marched to a jail. Best thing I could describe it as, and locked up in a \u0152 in a room. I remember the room vividly, there we-were quite a number of people in that cell. And I remember the green door and the bars on the door and the window and the toilet in the open, which was to be used by every body there and of course as children having to use the toilet in front of all these people was something we didn\u2122t like, and I remember the-they shielded us when we had to do so. And we were there for a period of time, I\u2122m not sure how long. My father had some papers with him and in \u0152 it \u0152 and he was concerned that th e Germans might see those papers and misinterpret them or find them, and he ate them.

            "answer": "I believe we were the only boys. There we re a lot \u0152 there were other people in that cell, in that room. Some of them were single men and single women, you know, these were groups. Husband and wife maybe, perhaps families as well. And at one point I guess we ha \u0152 my father had an opportunity to speak to the commandant there of \u0152 whoever he was. And he explained to him that he was tr aveling here on business. He had this document from \u0152 still \u0152 the Reichsbank, and that he had \u0152 was going to Holland to bid on some very important mate rials which were needed for the \u0152 the war effort in Germany or for the military, and they couldn\u2122t keep us incarcerated because he had to get on with this business. And the man apparently told them well, you know, I have to see \u0152 I \u0152 first thing I have to do is feed 3,000 Jews. He said, we\u2122ll take care of you after that\u2122s done. But apparently, coincidentally, the \u0152 there was a ship sailing from Holland for the United States which had booked passage for about a thousand Jews who had permission to come to the United States. The Aidam(ph) was the name of the vessel. And apparently this was made known to the German authorities there and they didn\u2122t want to create a situation \u0152 at least we think they didn't want to create a situation wher e there would become known that they prevented Jews from leaving. It would have been politically unwise, maybe created Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 34too much of a public relations problem for them. So they decided to let those Jews who had that passage booked, and pay for us to go to Holland to catch that ship, it was sailing from Holland, to go. And my father said, well look, I have my papers for Holland. Didn\u2122t have any passage on that ship or anything like that. And somehow he managed to get us in with this group to go to Holland. And it was just, I think, good fortune. There was a point just before we went into this jail where we \u0152 where my mother and father were told by the \u0152 whoever was leading us to this ersatz concentration camp that they had put up, or that \u0152 this jail where they were going, where they were apparently separating or segregating people, wh ere they were going to put them and what have you, assign them to some rooms. And they said to my parents, they said look, you will go to a concentration camp where you will be safe. Your children will go to an orphanage. And of course the minute Norbert and I heard this \u0152 and I recall that too \u0152 we started to raise the roof because we were not going to be separated from our parents. This was \u0152 we were just, I guess frightened. And I mean, really scared that we might be separated from them. And my mother said, children calm down. Nobody is going to se parate us from anybody. Before that happens, I will take your lives and mine right here. And she made it known, she was very distinct about it, and she always ca rried a \u0152 through her lifetime she always carried a paring knife, which she used to pe el apples, cause she loved apples. And she was fully prepared to take that knife and cut our throats and her own throat so that Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 35that wouldn't happen. And it wasn't so strange, because there were people who attempted suicide in that jail because they had lost everything, they knew they were going to be sent to a concentration camp, back where they came from. And there were any number of suicide attempts, some of them perhaps successful, I don\u2122t know. Anyway, that was \u0152 in that moment, I don\u2122 t know what made the Germans say forget about it, or go on with your \u0152 the way I heard it my mother said, go on, take your brats and get out of here. I\u2122m not sure that that was the case, cause I don\u2122t remember that, but it could very well have been. And we went \u0152 we were then on the train with all these other people, or we went to the border with all these other people to cross to go into Holland."

And in German bell \u0152 belling is to bark, like a dog. So they turned to us, tu rned to me and they said bellmal(ph), or you know, ring the bell. And I looked at them kind of strange, I said, what do you want me to do? They said it again and I said bow wow. Which was the only thing I understood. Well, it was the hila rity of that moment and the relief of being \u0152 of having gone through what they had just experienced and gone through, that created a moment of just pure joy.

            "question": "Did the Dutch Jewish children accept you?",
            "answer": "Yes, they certainly did. We had no trouble getting along with the Dutch Jewish children. My parents were able still, in 1938 - 1939, shortly after they arrived in Holland, to get my parents \u0152 my grandparen ts out of Germany. Now, we know that they must have left without anything, beca use \u0152 at least my grandparents must have Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 40left Germany with nothing in their pocke ts, to speak. We know that \u0152 well, the Germans made the Jews pay for all the damage they \u0152 they caused on Kristallnacht, that\u2122s history. And they weren\u2122t allowed to own property, they weren\u2122t \u0152 things became so oppressive for Jews that my grandfather, I\u2122m sure, sold his house for a pittance at that time because there was nothing else he could do with it. Whether he could every take the money with him to ge t it out, I don\u2122t know, I have no idea. But they managed to get them to Holland, and they had an apartment in Amsterdam, not too far from where we lived. My brother and I used to bicycle down to their place. As a matter of fact, a-about 10 years ago it is now that I was in Amsterdam, I went to see where we lived, which I r-re-remembered. I\u2122ve been there recently too, and I actually took some pictures of that. And I could find my way still, to my grandparents home, it\u2122s so well ingrained in my mind. My pare nts, the moment they arrived in Holland said well, we\u2122ve got to start thinking about a little \u0152 getting even further away from Germany and finding a \u0152 another place to go because if it can happen there, it can \u0152 might happen here. We just don\u2122t feel secure. It was not just that, it was also, I think for economic reasons. You can imagine all the Jews that wound up in Holland, all seeking employment. And the competition for my father must have been extremely severe. He was the young man who arrived, he got the dirty jobs. He had to do all the traveling, which in many ways was f \u0152 wa s good, it helped, because he could \u0152 he went to \u0152 to England quite a great deal. Matter of fact, he even \u0152 he even walked into Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 41the foreign office in England, offered his services because he was so much aware of where German industry was and what they needed and what they had to buy, because that was his business, this is what he did. And he ma \u0152 was able later to make use of those connections, when we finally left Holland to come to the United States, he was \u0152 that \u0152 that helped him a great deal. But they had \u0152 my parents, during the time that they were in Germany had applied for visas to come to America as did practically every Jew in Germany. And the likelihood of that happening was extremely, extremely slim. It was a lottery system and \u0152 and when he \u0152 and when they wound up in Holland, my father said you know, I\u2122m going to contact the American embassy in Stuttgart and we will have our files transferred to Rotterdam. After all, we\u2122re now in Holland, doesn\u2122t do us any good to have that file in Stuttgart, why not? So he wrote them a letter and he got the file transferred over there. And I suppose that lot of things came that worked together at that time. There were a lot of people who just couldn\u2122t, even when their number came up for a visa, couldn\u2122t accept it any more cause they\u2122d already been transported somewhere else, to the concentration camps, or what have you. And the quot a suddenly opened up enough so that one day \u0152 we were in Holland I think for almost a year and a ha lf, two years, close to that. Suddenly he got a call from Rotterdam, Mr. Schnog, bring your family here for a medical exam. If you pass the medical exam you will be able to come to the United States, you\u2122ll get your visa. So they had to make a decision as to whether to stay \u0152 of course they had Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 42jobs and they were well settled in Holland, or whether to leave. And after everything that happened in Germany, and I think also because of the severe competition for jobs in Holland at the time, they decided th-there\u2122s no question about this, let\u2122s \u0152 let\u2122s get out, let\u2122s get as far away from this menace in Germany as we possibly can. And they went to the embassy, we had our physic als, and in two weeks they had a visa to come to the United States. All that excitement, you can well imagine. They started packing up their things and making plans. And because they couldn\u2122t \u0152 I don\u2122t know whether they could bring thei r money out of Holland or whether they had a problem with that, but they decided to book passage first class because they couldn\u2122t do anything else with the money, on Cunard. Cunard White Star line from London, or Liverpool they sail \u0152 sail from, to the United States. And packed up our things, sent them ahead and suddenly we were leaving Holland. Left f \u0152 said goodbye to my grandparents and we went to th e airport, Schiphol, I think it was, pretty sure, and we boarded \u0152 and this was during the \u0152 this was already during the war, during the Phoney War between England and Germany, because in 1940 England was drawn into the war because the Germans had invaded Poland. There was a \u0152 an agreement that they would \u0152 that England would declare war, and they did."

One of the things that was so interesting in Holland, so many things happened, as a child this would be interesting, apparently we had a friend, I don\u2122t know whether he was an immigrant from Germany or what, and we were very much into cars, my brother and I. My father at one time in Germany had owned a \u0152 a lot, a car lot where people would bring their old cars and he wo uld disassemble them for the metals, the copper and the \u0152 all the precious metals that were inside and sell the rest of it off as scrap. And my brother and I often went there and played in the old cars, you know. We\u2122d climb into the cabs and turn the wheels. It was a lot of fun, very enjoyable. So cars were a passion for us, we could recognize every au tomobile on the street s, what it looked like, whether it was an Opal or whether it was a \u0152 a Ford or a Volkswagen or whatever, we knew it all. And in Holland this man came over and he \u0152 was a brand new car, I think it must have been a Nash or something like that, as I recall and it was a very modern styling for that time and my brother and I were so impressed. Well it turned out this fellow had stolen the car and it wasn\u2122t long before they caught him and I guess put him in jail, I hope in Holland, not in Germany, but they \u0152 they did. So there were all these adventures. I remember my mother taking us to the tulip fields, and seeing that. We \u0152 we spent a week or two weeks of vacation sailing in the Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 46Zuiderzee, which at that time was open to the North Sea, which has since been dammed in.

            "question": "Did you know any En glish at this point?",
            "answer": "Not a word. Not a word of English. I was fluent in Dutch, I could speak German, of course. And what impressed me about E ngland were the barrage balloons. England being at war, although the air raids had not started, they were flying these barrage balloons over London. They were not more than, I would say 200 yards off the ground, up in the air. So they \u0152 they looked like small blimps floating everywhere. And all the \u0152 at every intersection where the police had a traffic cop or something, their \u0152 their huts were all sandbagged in. And they were on a war footing. And this impressed us, my brother and I. The blackou t during the night. Cars driving around without \u0152 with shielded headlights. And \u0152 so I remember that \u0152 that wartime London. And I \u0152 I remember my brother getting sick in the hotel, he had caught some \u0152 some something. What it was I don\u2122t know. But he was there, maybe it was influenza or Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 48something like that, and we were stuck in the hotel. And my parents had to stay with him. My father was out \u0152 would go to th e \u0152 to his office there in London, he had friends and etcetera. And they sent me out to purchase a bulb for a flashlight, because he needed it at night, everything was black ed out. And they said okay, now you go down Regent Street right here and down a few blocks and you walk into a store, it\u2122s about a block down and you go ask for a light bulb. Of course, they told me this in Dutch. And I said, well what\u2122s that in En glish? And they said, well we\u2122ll look it up for you. And they looked it up and they sa id, well you ask for a bulb. I said bulb? And she \u0152 yeah. And off I went, I couldn\u2122t speak a word of English. And marched down Regent Street, into the store and I asked for a bulb and managed to get it without any difficulty. I think it \u0152 that was a interesting and very formative experience for me. It taught me a little bit of independence, that you could go anywhere, and you didn\u2122t have to be afraid, that you coul d make yourself understood, no matter what. And \u0152 and for a young \u0152 for a young man that was, I thought, kind of maturing and I came back and we had it. Now, we had to stay, we had to get permission in London to stay a little longer because my brother was ill. And they had booked the passage with Cunard line but they hadn\u2122t \u0152 the ship hadn\u2122t been designated at that time. So my father had to go to the police there to get an extension. And he called his friends at the foreign office at the time and said here, you know, I need to get an extension, can you help me out? He was afraid that they wouldn\u2122t Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 49permit it. And they said well, just go to th e police, don\u2122t worry about it. Just go in there and ask them. And he went there and they said of course, you know, you don\u2122t have any problems here, you can stay as long as you like. This they didn't understand, or didn\u2122t \u0152 you know, they didn\u2122t expect it. I can\u2122t say they didn\u2122t understand it, they didn\u2122t expect it. They didn\u2122t expect that you could have so much freedom in \u0152 in any country and there woul dn\u2122t be somebody who would say no, you can\u2122t do this or you can\u2122t \u0152 you \u0152 you must have these papers, or you must go back. I\u2122m sorry, you can\u2122t stay, you have to go back to where you came from. Not there. And these were very comforting for them. My brother and I didn\u2122t \u0152 really weren\u2122t concerned, cause we weren\u2122t aware that these \u0152 that this might be a problem or that they were \u0152 tha-that my parents were concerned about it. But eventually \u0152 of course my brother got better in about three or four weeks and in March, I guess it was, must have been March, we finally told that the \u0152 we would have the passage on the Cunard White Star liner, the Britannic, and to go to Liverpool on such and such a day and we board \u0152 they didn\u2122t tell us what the name of the ship was because they were afraid that there would be too many \u0152 too much in formation around and it would get back to the Germans and there was this submarine warfare going on. They didn't want anybody to know what ships were in port and when they would be sailing. So they just said, come to Liverpool and you\u2122ll be on one of the vessels, the ships."

We showed up at Liverpool and we w \u0152 boarded the Britannic, and my father had been told when he booked the passage that they would be traveling in convoy across the Atlantic because of the submarine warfare.

I la \u0152 had one every day my mother says and I \u0152 I still remember them, they were great. But we got \u0152 we were told that we would have to have a lifeboat drill almost daily because of the fear of being s \u0152 being attacked by a submar ine. And my parents made us sleep in our clothes with our shoes next to the bed, and if we heard the foghorn three times, we were to get in \u0152 get those shoes on, don\u2122t tie the laces, just get them on, grab the life preservers and report to our lifeboat stations. Course, it never came to that, fortunately. But the first day out my father \u0152 we looked around and I was expecting to see this huge convoy of ships going across the ocean and I looked outside and Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 51there wasn\u2122t a ship in sight. And my father went to the captain and said, you know, I thought we were traveling convoy, where are all the other ships? And the captain said, oh that\u2122s nonsense, we are so fast we\u2122d outrace any convoy and we\u2122re going across the ocean. And indeed they did. As a matter of fact they zigzagged all the way across the ocean and I could stand on the tail of the ship and see the wake zigzagging across, to throw off any potential torpedo, I guess, that was directed in our \u0152 i \u0152 to \u0152 directed in our direction, so \u0152 and that was the voyage. I remember it and I loved it, as any child would, on a big ship. And we arrived in New York and were greeted by friends whom had \u0152 w ho had preceded us to the Un ited States.

And although we didn\u2122t know it at that time, they were, shortly after the Germans walked in, they were taken on the train and transported to, as I finally learned after visiting the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, they lost their lives in Sobibor.

And we wound up at a \u0152 right opposite where we had rented this cabin at a \u0152 at a \u0152 turned out to be a Jewish camp, summer camp. And we walked in, the camp hadn\u2122t started yet, but the owners were there and my parents asked whether they could stay there over the ni \u0152 overnight and they said oh, stay as long as you like. They saw two boys and obviously it was \u0152 they could sign up two campers, which indeed they did, so we wound up spending our summers there for th e next four or five years and it was wonderful experience for us, and a nice part of the country and we got to know a lot Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 62of interesting people and made a lot of frien ds, some of whom I still see today, and \u0152 went to camp with us."

When my \u0152 when we moved in here and we became \u0152 we were 11 or 12 years old, my parents said, well boys, you \u0152 you know, you have to think about your Bar-Mitzvah, and we went to a Jewish synagogue in Rego Park. Today it\u2122s a very large synagogue, at that time it was a small shul, very Orthod ox and we went to Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 63Sunday school, and we \u0152 and Hebrew scho ol and like every go od American boy we hated it.

But it was \u0152 and no \u0152 and what amazed me most was the teacher came over to me, are you okay?

In every way, we just \u0152 all of America did and we were in the forefront of it, we did it just the same way, we hated this dictator.

Not \u0152 not that we had any feeling because we immigrated and we came from Germany we had to do this, but simply because we were patriotic Americans.

Might ha ve been 1945, but I think that might have been too early. It must have been early in 1946, and Europe was devastated. And they went to Cologne and saw all the devastation that had been wrecked on the German cities by the continuous bombing. And they saw \u0152 they saw some of the people who lived there, or recognized them when they came back. A story that my mother and father tell \u0152 told, they went to Cologne and they looked up a couple who was \u0152 they had run the grocery store, I gue ss, there. And they went and asked about them, and they still were running a grocery st ore. And they went over there to \u0152 and they looked in the window there, I guess they were running a pastry shop or something like that. And the woman who ra n the shop, and my parents knew, looked out the window and saw my mother and she turned pale. She said, Mrs. Schnog, Frau Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 69Schnog, is that you? And my mother came in and said yes, it\u2122s me, we\u2122re back. How are you? Tell me, how did you survive? And they were, as my mother said, very decent people caught up in this horror story with the Germans, they \u0152 many of them couldn\u2122t do anything out of fear that something would happen to them. Indeed, my father tells the story about a man who coul dn\u2122t keep his mouth shut, he says, and he lived in Deutz near my grandparents. He wa s Christian, he hated the Nazis. He let everybody know that these \u0152 Hitler and these Nazis would ruin Germany. And what\u2122d they do? They caught him, they cut his head off. So that kind of terror visited on a population brings about so much fear, that people shrink away. No wonder they put signs in their windows, no Jews. If they didn\u2122t, God knows what would have happened to them, in their own minds. So there were a lot of \u0152 a lot of Germans who didn\u2122t willingly participate in this, who did so I think out of fear, and what reprisals might be visited on them. There were some of course, who went right along with it, who \u0152 who thought Hitler was the last word and you know, this is \u0152 this is the new Siegfried, the \u0152 the hero of German mythology is going to \u0152 th-the vag \u0152 the Wagner people, all this romanticism that really isn\u2122t romanticism, it\u2122s just pure Germanic.

Five years passed and they were Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 70called before a judge and I re-remember going with them before the judge and the swearing in. And they were just thrilled, as I was, and \u0152 to become an American citizen. This was a dream that had come true for them. And shortly thereafter, we \u0152 my brother and I became citizens by derivati on. So we also were called and we were sworn in. And I, of course, have that certificate and it\u2122s something we\u2122re all very proud of, and we \u0152 listen, this country saved our lives. The fact that we got over here may have been pure luck, or it may have been God\u2122s doing. I don\u2122t think it was that, I think it was just plain luck and a little bit of fortitude and a little bit of courage on the part of my father, and seeing what was ha ppening and \u0152 well, but to escape so many times from \u0152 slip though at the last moment, always the la st to arrive before the doors shut, is something that amazes me. I am now probably the only survivor of my immediate family because my brother passed away at 54, he had pancreatic cancer and died. My mother died in \u0152 when she was 90 \u0152 91 \u0152 90 years old. My father died of the Alzheimer\u2122s disease in \u0152 when he was 84. But I often ask myself, you know, why am I here longer than the other? Why ar \u0152 why aren\u2122t there more of us who managed it? But you -- when I think about some of the stories that you read about people who don\u2122t believe or who refuse to accept the fact that there was a Holocaust at all, it\u2122s something that I don\u2122t \u0152 I \u0152 number one, I don\u2122t understand it. Number two, I ga \u0152 these are the kinds of people \u0152 the kinds of people who \u0152 who \u0152 whose thought process is so shallow, the same one who Hitler was able to \u0152 to inveigle to Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 71bring into his party. That\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s a horror and so anything that \u0152 you know, history is something that lives only with people who have lived it themselves. Those that haven\u2122t, except for the few who educate themselves, who will re ad history and will be able to understand it, for \u0152 except for those, people not only forget, but it has no meaning for them. They read a history book. There was World War II, it lasted from this date to that date. This is what s \u0152 took place, but it means nothing. It means absolutely nothing. When I was a child I talked to my grandfather and I asked him about World Wa r I. My grandfather served in the German army in World War I, and he told me stories. He told me the story one day of an airplane that came and dropped two bombs in Cologne, and I was impresse d. But World War I had no meaning to me. Not from what was relayed to me. It meant nothing. World War II, yes, had every meaning. I was too closely involved . You know, look at our children today. They look back and they come to me and they want to know a little bit about World War II, I can tell them certain things about World War II, but it won\u2122t have any meaning for them. They are much closer to the last war we fought in, the desert or in perhaps Vietnam if they\u2122re a little older and went through that era. But even that passes, and if they don\u2122t inform themselves and don\u2122t reach back and read the history and in \u0152 get involved a little bit more closely into what \u0152 perhaps into people\u2122s lives, or into \u0152 there have been some wonderful books written about World War II. If they don\u2122t read that, or if they \u0152 if you haven\u2122t read \ufb01All Quiet on the Western Front,\ufb02 you Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 72would not really understand the abhorrence of war that came out of World War I. And I think that\u2122s missing today and much of that is missing and it\u2122s too bad, it really is and I think this is the kind of thing th at fosters the thoughts that the Holocaust never happened. And it sure did. There was one other vignette that\u2122s rather interesting. A few years ago, here in America, my parents were living in Florida and my mother \u0152 I came down to Florida to go to attend an affair of some sort. I\u2122ve forgotten whether it was a formal affair or whether we were just going out for \u0152 for dinner. And I was over at her apartment, we were chatting and I was getting dressed. I was staying with her. And I had forgotten to bring my cufflinks. And I said, Mom, you know, I don\u2122t have any cufflinks, did Dad have any? And she said yeah, yeah, wait a minute, I have something for you. And she brought out a pair of silver cufflinks. She said these \u0152 these will do fine. And I looked at them and I said, yes they will, where\u2122d Dad get these? She said, well, it\u2122s an interesting story, I have to tell you about it. And she said, when your father was young, about to be BarMitzvahed, 13 years old, there was a \u0152 your grandfather, Arnold, rented a room in his house to a German soldier, an officer. And he used that room to entertain his girlfriend. And he was a very nice gentlema n and he knew your father was being Bar-Mitzvahed, so he purchased those cufflinks for your father as a Bar-Mitzvah gift. And, she said to me, you\u2122d be interested in knowing the name of that German officer. And I said, yeah, well who was he? She sa id, his name was von Stauffenberg. And I Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 73star \u0152 I was startled; von Stauffenberg was the general who took part in the assassination attempt against Hitler in the latter stages of the war. So history touches you, no matter where you are, at one point or another, and here in a pair of cufflinks, it reaches back and it touches you. And it\u2122s these kinds of stories that make history alive. I hope I can pass all these things on to my children that they\u2122ll remember it. I don\u2122t know whether I \u0152 I have myself been back to Germany on several occasions. I\u2122ve been there on business and I\u2122ve met pe ople in Germany. And you can\u2122t help, when you meet one of the older generati on, my generation, you can\u2122t help but wonder where they were in those years between \u212238 and \u212244, what they were doing, whether they took part in any of the atrocities that were visited on the Jews. But you hesitate to ask. Maybe my parents weren\u2122t so afraid. Maybe they did ask, a few times. But I\u2122ve never asked. I\u2122ve met some of the younger people and they don\u2122t really have a recollection of it, and in that case perhaps it\u2122s good for them, for Germany. One of the interesting trips that we recently took, we went a cruise and wound up \u0152 up in the \u0152 in the Baltic. And we would up in Rostock. And there they had a bus trip to Berlin. Well, for the people who were on the cruise, and there were a group of Jewish people on the cruise w ho wanted to s \u0152 particularly see the synagogue in Berlin. My wife and I didn\u2122t have an overriding interest to do that, but they needed to gather enough people togeth er to \u0152 to put a busload together and we volunteered to join them.

            "answer": "Right. So, as I say, we volunteered to go along with them, and we went into Berlin and we had a German guide, a young woman, very knowledgeable, who took us around and showed us the highlights in Be rlin and the tour. And the tour a \u0152 the centerpiece of the tour was going to see Checkpoint Charlie, and what used to be East Germany and the wall, this small section that they preserved for histo \u0152 for history. And very little was remembered by the guide of \u0152 or was told to any of us about World War II and what happened in Berlin during that period of time, period of years. It was interesting observation for me, because the young Germans were more \u0152 much more affected, and understandably so , by the separ \u0152 the \u0152 the separation of east and the \u0152 Germany and West Germany and the hardships that the eastern Germany \u0152 Germans experienced, and the fa ct that they were separated from their families and couldn\u2122t see each other, and th e \u0152 the wall and the suicides that resulted from that, or people who were killed trying to escape. And this was foremost in their minds, this was how horrible things were dur ing those years. They didn\u2122t look back to World War II and what happened then. That was not part of their being, their Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 75substance, their \u0152 their memory, and \u0152 exce pt for one instance, which I found highly interesting. She told us, the guide, that she was taking us to the university in Berlin. And we got out and there was this very la rge square, quadrangle in the center of the university. And we marched out to the middle of this square and mostly cobblestones and in the middle was a square. I don\u2122t kno w, I would say it was the size of, oh, maybe three meters by three meters, so about \u0152 roughly about thr \u0152 a little more than three yards by three yards square, and glass, right in the ground. You kn \u0152 you know, it was part of the \u0152 the ground, it wa \u0152 it wasn\u2122t raised in any fashion. And she gathered everybody around this glass squa re that was cut into the ground and she said, would you please look down and tell me what you see? And we looked down and what we could see under the glass we re empty bookcases around the square and she asked whether we knew what that was. And of course being all Jews, many of us did know exactly what it was. It\u2122s a representation and a memorial of the book burning, where the Nazis had burned all the books. An \u0152 and that that would be there in \u0152 at the University of Berlin, well I thought was extremely interesting. The fact that she knew about it and that she was willing to tell us about it, even though it was not on her tour and that she wa sn\u2122t expected to show us this, was very interesting for us. Then we wound up \u0152 which they clearly avoided because they saved it for the last part of the day, we wound up at the Jewish synagogue there, which was burned by the Germans, probably on Kristallnacht, an d \u0152 and restored. Now it\u2122s no longer being Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 76used as a synagogue cause it was violated as religious ground. But we stood outside. There\u2122s a museum right next door to it wh ere we could go in for a few minutes and see what there was, we really didn\u2122t have much time. But there were two plaques on the outside of the synagogue explaining wh at had happened and how it was restored, etcetera. And most of my fellow cruise members couldn\u2122t read German etcetera, so I wound up being the one who read the plaques for them and translated it for them, and they were quite moved by it. And I was please d to be able to open their eyes to this and to be able to read them. Now I think they were, strangely enough, more affected by it than I was, because I had been through it, I had seen it. I think it was more of a shock to most of these people this actua lly happened and that this is where it took place and these are the \u0152 the memorials to it. So I \u0152 I found that trip very enlightening and I guess more so from the point of youth that the Germans today are, just like everybody else in the world, they are obsessed with th e history of today and not with the history of yesterday."

And we \u0152 we thought we might be able to get a nice plush assignment, maybe go to Japan, which was very interesting, or I thought, my goodness, you know, I\u2122m fluent in German, maybe they could send me to Germany, you know, I could \u0152 would be a wonderful opportunity. Well, of course the United States Army doesn\u2122t think in those terms. Nor did they know or did they think in the terms that I was an engineer, a graduate, they could have put me into any number of positions where that would have been useful. No, I was in the ordinance corps and I was going to be \u0152 and I had th at \u0152 you know, they had all these electronic things, they could have easily put me into that and he lped, but no, no, I\u2122m going to Korea and that\u2122s that. So off we went, my brother and I both went to Korea. Fortunately we went shortly after Eisenhower had made his historic visit to Korea and the war was \u0152 the fighting had stopped. And we were ther e just shortly afterwards. So the country was extremely poor, Korea, and it wa \u0152 had been destroyed and we wound up at the \u0152 Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 78at an army depot near Incheon, [indecipherable] city. I\u2122ve since been back and you can\u2122t recognize it any more, the country has boomed econ omically and \u0152 of course not in North Korea, but at least in South Korea it has. And we spent \u0152 I spent two years there. My brother was stationed up on the DMZ, th e demilitarized zone at the time, and we\u2122d see each other occasionally, I would fly up with friends of mines who were pilots and \u0152 and in \u0152 in the army. They would fly me up in these sal \u0152 small planes and I\u2122d visit him or -- and he would return the visit. Sometimes we\u2122d \u0152 got our Jeeps and drove up through these rutted road s and dust and \u0152 and it was a \u0152 it was a boring existence cause there was nothing to do, and Korea was cold and miserable. The rats were the size of \u0152 well, pigs. They were huge, and you\u2122d live with them. There were a lot of \u0152 there were a lot of people who had been displaced by the war, a lot of orphans in orphanages, which you know, just tore your heart out. And as soldiers and as officers, we did what we could to help out these orphanages. We collected from our troops and from the re \u0152 other officers to help these people, and they were very grateful, they were \u0152 for everything that we could do there. They\u2122re a tough people, the Koreans, they really are and they manage to survive. But it \u0152 you really \u0152 it was not the kind of service that I expected in the United States Army. I expected, you know, World War II, you\u2122re goi ng to go out, fight, right? But no, no, no, nothing like that. Met a lot of people and learned a little bit about the average American, and how much \u0152 how important the average American is to America\u2122s Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 79life, and how basically good they are, despite \u0152 da \u0152 it doesn\u2122t matter what their level of education is. It really didn\u2122t matter and th ere were people \u0152 I was \u0152 one of the jobs that was assigned to me, I was a commande r of a depot supply company there and one of the other jobs I had was to \u0152 was for the education, I was the education officer for the battalion and we had many, many se rgeants, people who had worked their way up through the ranks, who barely had an education above a grade school level. And we furnished them with additional \u0152 with \u0152 with schools and tried to bring them and as well as many of the \u0152 the enlisted men up to at least a grade level or a high school level education. But it didn\u2122t matt er how educated they were, they were basically very, very good people, very honest people. I had a group of sergeants who I got along with extremely, extremely well. They did things for me \u0152 at that time there was absolutely no accountability for supplies in the United States Army. And when I was \u0152 when I signed \u0152 when I to ok over the command of my company, I signed off on things I didn\u2122t know I had, or didn\u2122t know existed and \u0152 and when it finally came time for me to turn the company over to the next officer that would take over, I had to do a \u0152 an inventory really, wh at th \u0152 what the heck did we have and what did I sign for, and you know, I\u2122m respon sible for this, have to sign it back. And there were \u0152 there was a Jeep in there that I remember that I neve r even knew existed. And \u0152 and we had \u0152 and we had some things that we had so much in excess of that it shouldn\u2122t have been there, but I se \u0152 I said to one of my sergeants, I \u0152 what \u0152 what Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 80are we going to do about this, or where\u2122s this Jeep? He said oh please lieutenant, he said, don\u2122t worry about it, just bring the g uy over tomorrow morning, we\u2122ll take care of it. So in the morning I came over with a new officer and I introduced him to my staff and I said okay, would you \u0152 h-here is our inventory, would you sign off on it please? And we start looking around and when he checked it off and we went outside and there is this Jeep sitting there and I look at the inventory list and the serial number, everything is just exactly the wa y it should be. And I said hm, I guess it must have been somewhere, but \u0152 and the fellow signed off and everything was just perfect. And when he left I pulled out a bottle that I had there and I said, look gentlemen, the s \u0152 the sergeants \u0152 well, you know, I guess this is goodbye. I want you to have a drink and \u0152 and we exchanged pleasantries, had a drink and I said, now wait a minute sergeant, I said, where the hell\u2122d that Jeep come from? And he said sir, he said, in about five minutes we have to return it to battalion A, and we\u2122ve got to repaint the thing. So it\u2122s that kind of thing. Everybody would help everybody out."

So then we were finished with our service in the army after 14 months, came back to the United States and I at that stage had a choice to make in my career as to whether I wanted to be an engineer for the rest of my life, or whether I wanted to try something else.

I can always go back to engineering. And he said sure, and he got me a job. I essentially went to work for my father\u2122s company. My brother, who graduated Cornell as an electrical engineer as I did, was pretty close to being top in his class. I \u0152 I was, I guess, the goof off and he was the one who a-applied himself. Not only did he apply himself, he had a calling for engineering. He wa s a lot like my father, my father always wanted to be an engineer and never had the op portunity.

Interestingly e nough, one of the highlights of his career was that he testified before Congress.

            "answer": "I worked for my father and we \u0152 I was stationed up in Boston for awhile learning how to become a steel scrap trader. And it was very difficult. I had problems dealing with New Englanders because they were so difficult to talk with, you know, they didn't open up. I \u0152 I think one of the thin gs I learned there was that sometimes it\u2122s good to keep your mouth shut. I never forget the time I had to persuade a New England scrap dealer to sell me a carload of scrap, because we were going to ship it Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 84off to \u0152 on a ship com \u0152 saili ng out of Boston. And he was selling all his scrap to a competitor. And so I went in to see him \u0152 Leroy was his name. And I said \u0152 I introduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I\u2122d like to buy your scrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this is what I\u2122m ready to pay for it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what have you. And then I had ma de my pitch, I said, what do you think? And he didn\u2122t answer. He just sat there. And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say something, or shouldn\u2122t I? And I said, you know, I\u2122ve just said everything that I need to say. If he\u2122s not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit. For once in your lifetime, don\u2122t say anything. So I sat th ere what was an interminable amount of time and I don\u2122t know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which is ridiculous, you know, you\u2122re sitting there and you\u2122re wondering what you\u2122re going to do, and beginning to sweat. Should I get up and leave, what? And he suddenly said, yup, okay. Now, I don\u2122t know what he was thinking about, I have no idea. And I won\u2122t ever question it. But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the order and that was that. So I learned a lot from that experience. I stayed with that company, I wasn\u2122t happy there in New England, and moved back to New York and met Ben Livingston, who was an elderly ma n, was my father\u2122s partner for some years. And we \u0152 and I got into the import and export business in \u0152 in \u0152 in steel. It was in the new steel business. And in 1962 he retired from the company. And I know he Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 85was \u0152 he was not happy retiring, he was an active man. He was in his 70\u2122s, but wanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same way today and I\u2122m probably about the same age he was when he retired. And so, with my father\u2122s help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and we said, let\u2122s go out in business and start the business. And I figured that Ben Livingston had a good re putation in the field. If he stayed active in the business for just three years, we\u2122d have enough grounding in order to be able to \u0152 to run the business without him. Well, we did. We we nt out, found a small office in the Lincoln building in New York and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of mine and Ben Livingston, the younger a ssociate. And we started to build the company. And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was as \u0152 he\u2122s \u0152 he was \u0152 h-he lived until he was 89 years old. He came into the office every single day. He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very close friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back and forth f-for \u0152 for many years. We \u0152 I finally took over as the president of the company and it was extremely successful, it worked out quite well. Into \u0152 one of the interesting incidents I\u2122ll never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80\u2122s already and found it difficult to get around. He was using a cane. He was a big man, heavy, and he would start losing some of his agility. And I was in the office talking to him, I was going to take a trip to Argentina, a business trip and I sat down and I told him Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 86what I was going to do, and how we were going to get around, we had a problem there, and discussed the problem with hi m and how best to solve it. Suddenly the lights went out in the building and we were on the \u0152 that time on the 21 st floor of the Lincoln building. And I said okay, let\u2122s sit around, let\u2122s see what happens. And half an hour passed and the lights didn\u2122t co me back on. And I said, you know, something\u2122s going on. We called up and we found out the whole east coast was blacked out. I don\u2122t know whether you remember the big blackout. And I said Ben, I don\u2122t know whether we\u2122re going to get home. The trains aren\u2122t running, everything is closed down. I just made a telephone call, the whole east coast is blacked out. I don\u2122t \u0152 can\u2122t \u0152 don\u2122t think I can leave you here. A nd he said well, you know something, I \u0152 if you\u2122ll help me I \u0152 let\u2122s go up to my cl ub. He was a memory of the Harmony Club up on Fifth Avenue, which was up on 60 th Street. And I said, all right, come on, I\u2122ll help you. And we \u0152 poor fellow, he walked down 21 flights of stairs with his cane, and we started walking uptown. It was an extraordinary night. You know, people didn\u2122t know what was happening, it was the height of the Cold War, people thought that the Russians were sending missile s over and bombing Amer ica and we were going to be attacked any moment, and ther e were all kinds of fears everywhere. People were praying, it was just unbelievabl e what was happening in New York City. And we were walking up Fifth Avenue, straight up Fifth Avenue. And Ben got pretty tired. We were up near 50th Street and he was kind of exhausted by this time, and Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 87there was Saint Patrick\u2122s Cathedral right there next to us. And I said Ben, you know, why don\u2122t we go inside and sit down, you know, you can use a spell of rest, and I \u0152 and he said you know Al, that\u2122s a good idea, let\u2122s go. So we went to Saint Patrick\u2122s cathe \u0152 Cathedral, which was amazing. It was lit up by candles and people, you know, they were afraid, they didn\u2122t know what was ha ppening and they were praying and i-it was an extraordinary sight. And we sat down, we just sat and relaxed for awhile until \u0152 and I observed all this, the people crying, people in fear, people not knowing where they were going to go, peopl e just resting like we were. And finally Ben said okay, I think I\u2122m up to going a little bit further. And we marched from there the next 10 blocks to get up to the Harmony Club. We walk ed in and he said, come on up to the second floor. We went up to the second floor, wherever it was and there were these huge leather chairs. And we just plopped down and he said okay, now what will you drink? And we had some scotch and really just enjoyed that evening. And eventually I think I found my way home by \u0152 I left Ben there, I knew he was taken care of and I found my way home with a group of other guys in a taxi that night. That\u2122s what I remember about Ben Livingston then."

I \u0152 so all those things come from, I think, my past. I have no patience for people who try to bully others in any shape or form. I think that also stems from my childhood.

But it \u0152 it existed in Germany in a very, very special way, and I don\u2122t think it\u2122s \u0152 i-it\u2122s exactly the same thing. The Germans made a specialt y of it, and they did so historically for many, many, many years. I mean, you go b ack to Bismarck and even back further, the \u0152 the Prussians and their \u0152 y-you can go back to \u0152 to Middle Ages and the \u0152 the Germans and their \u0152 their mythology of \u0152 wa s always the \u0152 the hero worship and the loyalty to \u0152 to anything but \u0152 but a democratic society.

I\u2122m sure it is in many ways. German philosophy is replete with th is sort of thing, of \u0152 of the super race, which is what Hitler really played on. I don\u2122t see that elsewhere in the Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 95world, I am not seeing it elsewhere in the world. Sure, people think we\u2122re better than you are. There\u2122s a group in the \u0152 in Africa, when one ethnic group tries to annihilate another, sure they think they\u2122re better than they are, but they don\u2122t try to set themselves up as a super race, as somebody that could dominate the world, and the Germans always managed to do that, or th ey have in the last 150 years anyway. Or maybe not so right now, but th ey did before that. And so this militarism that I saw there and experienced there, I think is unique , or was, at least in my view, was unique to Germany."
