            "question": "And when did liberation come for you, and what was it like? What state of mind, what physical health were you in, and where were you?",
            "answer": "I was liberated in a silo after the last march called Chinno, that a lot of ki -- little camps out of Stutthof were concentrated. And the two typhuses broke out. And to tell you the honest truth, I don\u2019t remember when I was liberated. I thought they were burning down the silo, so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead around me, and I woke up in a German house, with the Russian\u2019s doctor taking care of me. I had the two typhuses. And then they shaved my head again, and they put a salve on it, and I looked like musselwoman. And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize anything. And after three days, or a week, I don\u2019t know exactly, they told us we have to leave that village, because the front 1s coming on. So we should walk to Lomborg. Lomborg is in Polmarin. And it was not far from Chinno. And as we were walking, I with a little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will never forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers, and we asked them to take us to Lomborg, and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we -- they shouldn\u2019t notice that we have typhus. And they said, \u201cNo, we cannot do it, because we are not allowed to.\u201d But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us behind, in that little carriage, but they said, \u201cThe first house in Lomborg, you have to get out.\u201d So, as we came into Lomborg, the first house, they said in -- in Russian, out. So, we went out, and the first house we walked in. And all I can remember is everything was empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don\u2019t know, at that time I didn\u2019t know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else. And in the middle was standing a bottle, with blueberries. And I didn\u2019t know it was preserve, or something. There was no water in that house, nothing. And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out. And sh -- she said, \u201cShall we drink it?\u201d I said, \u201cI am afraid it may be poisoned.\u201d Left poison, there\u2019s that bottle standing there, there\u2019s no water, there\u2019s nothing. And then we couldn\u2019t stand it any more, and what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries. And at that time I was so young, I didn\u2019t know nothing. Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we felt so much better, that it was fermemented. It was set up for wine, or something, and it helped the temperature. And our temperature dropped. We s -- we went around, and we looked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized some people from my hometown, and they was already looking -- you know, after two weeks, three weeks, they\u2019re grown up people. And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for them, because the Russians are going on the front to Lomborg, and they were raping the women. German, Jewish, it didn\u2019t matter. They were getting drunk and raping them. So what they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their apartment where they lived, six women. And if you put a sign up that it\u2019s typhus, the Russians didn\u2019t care, they just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos. And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave me a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the front room, and turn on the light, and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick with the salve on my head. They start running. And this is how I saved six women from being raped by the Russians. Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going down the stairs, and there was a little pond near that apartment, and there wasn\u2019t that much water, and anything, and I thought I\u2019Il wash out my -- whatever I have, in that pond. And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection He said, \u201cAteeja dofka.\u201d I mean, am -- am I Jewish. And I said yes. He said, \u201cI am too, from Odessa, don\u2019t get scared.\u201d So I took him up into the apartment where the girls were. They saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d You know, they dragged me back in the other room. And it so happened that it -- he was there for two weeks. He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me. He gave me even a wedding band. And I wasn\u2019t even 15 years old yet. But nobody knew that. And he says to me he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la -- his father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up. And I thought to myself, \u201cLet him talk.\u201d But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two weeks he slept in the front room of our apartment, so nobody could get in. And when he left, we went to work in a hospital, to help the Russian soldiers. So we slept there, so nobody could touch us there either. And one day a man came up to me, and he said, \u201c\u201cAkeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?\u201d Am I Marsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma -- Marioshka Supporzhnikov. And I said yes. \u201cMy son wrote a letter at home that you are here in Lomborg, and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the hospital. I would like to send you to Odessa. He wants to marry you.\u201d And I told him, I said, \u201cI cannot do it. | have to go back home first. I have to see where my -- if I have any family left, I have anything,\u201d I said. He said, \u201cDo you love my son?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know him well enough. I don\u2019t know what love 1s.\u201d Is -- I -- he didn\u2019t know my age, he didn\u2019t know nothing. Nobody know nothing about anybody. And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age, because my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15. And I -- so even after I was liberated, I was afraid to tell my age. So, even to that man that was the fa -- and I asked him, I said -- this may not be interested on the tape, but I asked him, I said, \u201cTell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different town than your son 1s, and you\u2019re not even Jewish?\u201d Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name was, I don\u2019t even remember, and he says, \u201cYou see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and doctors, and send us to different places, because when we were caught from the Germans, that the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn\u2019t give us out that we are Jews on top of it.\u201d So this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn\u2019t the only one that suffered, and there were other people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my mind. And we felt better, and we didn\u2019t know there was [indecipherable] existed. We didn\u2019t know about people not going back home or nothing. All I want is to go home, and see what\u2019s happened."

            "question": "Would you let me ask you just one quick question. Did you know anything about your family members at that point? Are -- you know your sist -- your two sisters -- you said your two sisters were --",
            "answer": "My two little sister, my mother, was taken away in Stutthof. I didn\u2019t know if they are - were dead, or alive, or nothing. I had a feeling that they were killed there. All taken to Theresienstadt. Now that I read the books about it, ther -- and then from there to Auschwitz. I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I can only tell you I lost them, about maybe a week after we were in Stutthof. But the only thing that bothered me 1s that they were taken out of the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and given civilian clothes when they were taken away. And when I wanted to go with them, they left a big dog on me, this is all in my other tape. And all I wanted to go and see if anybody was left. I was -- my father was in Dachau. I know my grandfathers were taken away in the beginning, and -- and this -- I knew they were dead. My other family -- certain family members were all dead, because I know they were taken on the ninefort and killed in Kovno, of the Kovno ghetto. And anybody did nothing -- not many people escaped from the ninefort. But the thing is 1s, 1s -- what I want to tell you is that I wanted to go home. So they said yes, they\u2019 ll s -- they\u2019Il s -- put us on trains, and they\u2019Il send us home. So they put us on big trucks, and they took us to a place, a good -- I don\u2019t know how to say it in English, a ranch, a big ranch in -- in Palmerton, it was near Nimitz, near -- not far from Stetlin, not far from Lomborg, Rigenwald, Lomborg, and so on. And they took us there, and there were some Russian girls, white Russian girls, they were playing the piano. And the Jewish girls, the one that went with the Germans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to clean up stalls, and they put us to -- to -- to -- to -- to the dirtiest work in the world. They didn\u2019t give us enough food, the Russians. They didn\u2019t kill us, they didn\u2019t beat us, but there was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were always watched, we were always watched with guards, like in the [indecipherable]. The only difference was that we weren\u2019t beaten up, we weren\u2019t treated as dirty Jews, but we were treated different. There were about maybe 10 Jewish girls. And one day the captain asked me if I -- asked anybody if they would like to go to learn with veterinarian. There is a doctor in Rigenwald that will teach veterinarian, because what they were doing is taking the cows and the horses of the fields that were running wild. And they opened a conzerr factory, and they open a cheese factory. And what they did is, they needed the cows to be healthy, to see if they\u2019re healthy, they take -- to take analysis from horses -- I found that out later, when I came back. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d Like in German concentration camp, in those little camps, if they needed somebody to go to threshing, f -- harvesting or something, people were sent to s -- Auschwitz. I didn\u2019t care any more when they took away my mother, my two little sisters, and the rest of my family. So I was the first one, I -- he sa -- I said, \u201cI am going to Rigenwald.\u201d We came to Rigenwald, the doctor that they sent to teach us, 1t must have been from different camps around that, but from our camp we went only one Russian girl, and two Jewish girls. And what happened is is that -- what\u2019s so amazing is that the doctor was a drunk. He was compl -- always drunk. And we learned some. We learned how to protect when a cow 1s slaughtered, to recognize if it has tuberculosis around the lungs. We learned how to take analysis from a horse\u2019s neck. We learned ho -- if they got this eye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them. We learned the cows, they had a certain thing on their skin, to put them -- what is the end of a -- of a match called? It\u2019s a certain chemical. Put them in a tent, and put them into the chemical. So get away the sickness shouldn\u2019t spread. We learned certain things in -- in about three weeks, but the most important thing for me was that I made friends with the put -- Polkolvnik\u2019s wife, with the main man\u2019s wife. I must have had in me pa-part of it of my father, like I said before. She went in a nightgown to the opera, and [indecipherable] others. I -- I told her that\u2019s not proper. I told her your hair doesn\u2019t look, let me comb it for you. We got to be the best of friends, I and the Pot -- Polkolvnik\u2019s wife. And they treated me like a daughter the two weeks I was -- three weeks we were there. After three weeks we got a paper with a pitshot, you know, with the stamp, like the Russians always do. Akivia trinarn inyarz. I was a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not. We came into that village again, we worked. We worked with the horses, we worked this. Two weeks later, after we came back from Rigenwald, they put -- Polkovnik and his wife arrived in that good -- in that trench. There was a very, very ugly captain that run it, and he hated Jews, very anti-Semitic. And he said, \u201cAkdere Marouska?\u201d Where is marsh -- Marouska. And the captain said, \u201cIn her room with the other Jewish girl.\u201d He says, \u201cIn her room? You mean to tell me she doesn\u2019t have an apartment of her own?\u201d And his wife got very mad. He said, \u201cI want to call her immediately for dinner, to have dinner with us.\u201d Because there was dinner in the captain\u2019s house. It\u2019s a bi -- in the good -- you know, in the ranch, the big ranch house. So when he called me in, I had dinner with them, and he gave a order to the captain that I have to have my own apartment, that I have to be in charge of the cheese factory. I have to be sent to a different village. But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything prepared, and -- now, don\u2019t forget, in July atel -- I was liberated in March, and July atel 15. And what happened is 1s before I left for the other -- good for the other ranch, big ranch, the Jewish girls were playing a piano, and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls. But what they did is, I was there to be heavily guarded, because they would have killed me, the Russian girls. So what happened 1s is when I went to that good, I arrived, and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory, and at night the Russian soldiers from all around, from the good that I worked 1n, the ranch, from all the ranches they would come, and -- and Polish soldiers they would come, and I would give them all cheeses and milk, cause the Russian soldiers weren\u2019t fed either. They would cut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, and then they would make like a soup with potatoes, and every -- that all they had to eat all day. Everything was shipped to Russia. And what happened 1s 1s that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers, and the Polish soldiers came, and there came some fliers from Stettlin, and they would bring liquor and so on. But one thing would happen, when they would get too drunk, the woman that owned that ranch was a very, very wealthy woman. That\u2019s the first time I ate watfles in my life, because she had the stove that she moved waffles around. She was from Pullman. She was German, from Pullman, and she was like a mother to me. So the minute she saw that they got drunk, she lock me upstairs in one of the quarters, and nobody could get near me. But I did a lot of things in that camp that a child of my age wouldn\u2019t do. I was boar hunting, believe it or not. I was boar hunting with the Russians, with the Polish officers. I -- I did everything I wanted. I run that village. And I was ride out, with the guard of course, I would ride out to the fields, and check up on the pomeron women, and see the German women, and see how they milked the cows, if they are clean in the fields and so on."

            "answer": "Not very long -- didn\u2019t take me very long to build up, to feel sorry for those kids, and take them food, and take them medicine, and steal from the Russians. And one day the captain came to me, and that -- this is a really funny story. He came to me to my village. And he says, you know there was a befell -- was like when there\u2019s a order that the -- the Russians can take nothing away animal from the Germans. Absolutely nothing, no cows, no horses, nothing. And the eye sickness of the horses, I forgot how it was called. I was never a veterinarian, so I forgot it. Broke out and we lost seven horses, and they put -- Polkovnik was coming, and he said, \u201cYour village is full of horses.\u201d He\u2019s talking to a grown up person, you know. \u201cI need seven horses.\u201d I said, \u201cFine, Ill give you seven horses. You release seven see -- seven girls from the -- that you\u2019re holding. If you put them on the train, I\u2019Il give you seven.\u201d Said, \u201cI can\u2019t do that many, but Pll release some.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d So how do I do it? I have to have a plan. So I sat down, and I talked to the German woman that took care of me, and I made myself a plan. I am -- I got a lot of fantastic liquor from those majors that came, from the -- the pilots from Stettlin. And I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection invited seven officers from the Polish camp. And we got them so drunk that they were flat on the floor. We took off their uniforms, there were waiting seven Russian soldiers. We put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier, and the Russian soldiers, they went out, they got the seven horses, came back, got them dressed back their uniform, dropped them on a cart, and took them back to their camp. The next thing the rumor was in the village that the Polish army stole seven horses. Now I had something over that captain. He was so afraid of me that you have no idea. Because God forbid he should go to the higher ups, and everything. So everything I wanted, I got. So when the soldiers from each camp, when I rode with them, wanted to come and eat at my camp, they came and eat. If they wanted to -- whatever they wanted to -- the Jewish girls lived the life of Riley, and he was afraid of me as hell. One day I was riding with a man from Georgia, I\u2019Il never forget, and a short Jewish man came up to me, and in Jewish says to me, \u201cAre y -- do you know anybody by the name of Myashka Supporzhnikov?\u201d And I said to him like that. I put my hand to my throat, my mouth, and I said, \u201cOh please don\u2019t say anything.\u201d And the Russian soldier understood what he said, or he had a feeling. He said, \u201cMarouska, don\u2019t worry. Anything you want I\u2019ll do for you, because you saved my life, you got some medicine when I was sick. You brought food for me. I will help you with anything I can.\u201d A very, very lo -- I couldn\u2019t say low [indecipherable] because he was intelligent, with intelligent you have to be born. Very average person, you know? And I couldn\u2019t understand why he does it. And he said, you know what? So I tell him the story, that I found out from that man that my father is alive in Lodz, in Poland, and he came to pick me up. So he said to me, \u201cNot only will I take you -- let you go, but I\u2019Il take you to the train.\u201d And I want to tell you something. When we came into the villages, the houses were empty, but there was so much clothes, and jewelry, and cameras. With everything was in my apartment, when I was riding on that horse, I didn\u2019t even have a sweater on. I'll never forget, I had the silk, maroon blouse on. I remember now, I didn\u2019t remember before, riding boots, and -- and they\u2019re real good boots, because one of the officer, police officer, brought it to me, and riding pants. That\u2019s all I had with me, because I was going with him to check out the fields, how the milk is going, how everything is going. And I said, \u201cOkay. You are taking me to the train, but I\u2019m going to give you a letter. And when the captain does something to you, you tell him, \u2018I have a letter from Maroushka about the seven horses.\u2019 \u201d I said, \u201cAt least I can do for you that you don\u2019t get punished, or put in jail, or anything like that.\u201d So what I did 1s I -- I still wrote Russian at that time, I sat down, and in no time I wrote him a letter. He took us to the train. And that man says to me, \u201cNow remember, I am Polish, I speak very good Polish, your father send me, and I want you to be like you\u2019re -- you don\u2019t know how to speak, you don\u2019t know how to -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re dumb. Whatever anybody says, you just move your head.\u201d Because at that time, the Polish Akar, the Polish fascists were killing the Jews like crazy, especially on trains, and so on. And I listened to him, and he might -- I don\u2019t even [indecipherable] I was freezing a little bit. And I went to -- we went with the train and we arrived in Lodz."

            "answer": "So [arrived in Lodz, and my father, and everybody, we were partying, and of course I was smoking, like I said, and my father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t smoke,\u201d and I said, \u201cYes I can.\u201d And anyway, he did not have a big control over me, that I have to say. And it was very sad. And for one reason my father didn\u2019t have a big control over me, and I hate to say it, my father was a very selfish man, and I remembered him from ghetto, what he did to us. And I really -- I loved my father, but I didn\u2019t like him. I\u2019m sorry to say this, should rest in peace. And what happened is is that in Lodz he says to me -- he -- he knew that my mother is dead, and he got himself a girlfriend, a friend of my mothers, that she lost her husband and two kids, also in the Kovno ghetto. And what happened is is that he says to me, \u201cI have enough money to smuggle the border.\u2019\u2019 Now he-here he helps all the strangers, and his only leftover child, he says, \u201cI have enough money to smuggle the border for me and Rocholla. I don\u2019t have enough money for you.\u201d So what do I do? I went into the kibbutz, in -- to work in the hospital because I know how to give a injection, you know, I learned a little bit there at the Russian camp, by working with the animals, it\u2019s not that different to give a injection, and take a temperature, and so on. So I went into the kibbutz, and I stayed in the kibbutz, and I learned how to -- in Lodz -- and I worked in the hospital, and in Madrid the head of the kibbutz came to me, and he says, \u201cMarsha,\u201d -- now, nobody knew my age. I -- I looked so much older than I am, thanks God, that why I was alive -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s thanks God or not. And he says to me, \u201cYou know what,\u201d he says, \u201cyou want to go -- get over on the other side?\u201d I says, \u201cYes, I want to get away from L\u00e9dz,\u201d because I was engaged to a man that was 34 years old, and I was not -- I was 15. He gave a diamond watch to a friend of my fathers, to introduce us. And he was so jealous when I went away on business or something in Lodz, and when he came back and I wasn\u2019t home, he was running all over, looking for me. And I had already my wedding dress, because he impressed me so tremendously. You know, coming out of the concentration camps, coming out of that place, that Russian camp, and everything, and he brought me presents, and -- and he took me to places, but I could not speak Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Jewish, and I could not speak any other language with him. So he said, \u201cI will do the speaking, you keep quiet, Marouska.\u201d And that -- that was it. So he impressed me with all the diamonds, and all the sweaters, and -- and he was a very, very rich man."

Not many people could go to a movie in 1940s -- end of 1945, beginning of 1946. They couldn\u2019t go to a movie. They couldn\u2019t walk the streets and speak Yiddish. Absolutely not, Jewish. So what happened is is he impressed me with all those things, and I was going to marry him. Then -- and then I realized it, oh my gosh, I can\u2019t marry that man, that man 1s -- could -- is older -- practically as old as my father, he is jealous, I don\u2019t have no friends, I can\u2019t make any friends. Now this is me thinking, a youngster, a teenager. And I said, \u201cI have to get away from him.\u201d So on our engagement party at this cousin\u2019s estate in Lodz, I dance with his best friend, a Jew from the Polish army, and I came back to the couch, and he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. So I said to the friend, \u201cChaim, give me my cape.\u201d And I took my cape, and I went to my father\u2019s house. And I said, \u201cWould you like to go to Bratislav right now,\u201d the next morning? And he was running after me, and he was yelling, and stop, and he came to the door, and that friend of his left, and I locked the door. He said, \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cPack.\u201d And I run over -- from the other side, I run over to the kibbutz, and I told that man, I\u2019m taking - that was the next day that that was -- he wanted me to take the transport. Everything -- you see, we were trained to take the transport over the border, people that wanted to do it. And that what -- why I went into the kibbutz. He said to me -- I said to him, \u201cT\u2019ll take that transport. But my father and my stepmother go,\u201d -- I -- I mi -- I called her my stepmother, she wasn\u2019t yet -- \u201cgoes with me.\u201d He says, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s arranged.\u201d Because it so happened that the people that were supposed to take me -- it, the couple don\u2019t feel so hot."

            "answer": "Yeah. The ide -- I don\u2019t know. We had to get out of Lodz. Oh, yes, the idea to go to Palestine was from the beginning. To go to Palestine, that was my ideal thing. So here we are, we\u2019re ready, and everybody, I\u2019m taking 25 people over the border to Bratislav. From Lodz to Bratislav, the Akar shooting after us. Now, I want to tell you, my stepmother Rocholla, was with me in the same camp, and I helped her stay behind, because she froze her feet up. My feet were frozen, too. They took off her fingers from one foot, in Lodz, and she couldn\u2019t walk that fast. They wanted to take some of my toes off, and I wouldn\u2019t let them, because the doctor said there\u2019s a chance that they can heal that. So I went for therapy, and what I did 1s, I washed floors, I did everything to pay the doctor. And the doctor gave me therapy, hot and cold baths, and salves, and everything, and it starts -- it looked like I had a fungus on my foot, but it start healing. And I could walk. And then when I went into the kibbutz, the kibbutz paid part of it. So, in about two and a half months, my feet were ready to go. And I had those -- they got me orthopedic shoes at the kibbutz, and I went. And as we were going, what I wanted to tell you, I run away from that guy -- later on I heard he had a nervous breakdown, I don\u2019t know about that one. But I want to tell you the Akar, you couldn\u2019t go to a movie, you couldn\u2019t go to a restaurant if you were Jewish, if you spoke Jewish. They a -- every day they had something happen Jew in L\u00e9dz. One was shot in a -- in a bus stop, the other one was deesent, it was terrible. For me, it was a terrible thing, because as bad as the Russian was, they never beat us, they never hurt us, they never shot us. So I went and I took that transport. And the Akar was shooting after us. It was in the middle of the night. And I -- ed -- everybody slowed down, and they were mad at me because of my stepmother. It didn\u2019t take long we arrived in Bratislav. Arrived in Bratislav, my father never said thank you to me for taking him, and everything else, but they put us on trains to go to Germany, and to go -- and it so happened that we went through Austria with the train. And they said, \u201cWho would like to stay in Austria?\u201d And I saw those beautiful mountains, and that beautiful scenery, and like I told you, at the Russian camp I was boar hunting, and I was riding, and I loved sports. Even as a child, when I was eight years old, I was at the school Olympics, you know. So what happened is is that I was a daredevil. I was a -- like I\u2019m a tomboy when I was a youngster. Because there was a certain branch out from my wer -- my grandfather from my mother\u2019s side was a very well-to-do man, and I was his angel. It\u2019s supposed to be a boy, but still he called me by a boyish name, Yankela. But I was his life. So what I mean is that I -- I -- from the beginning, you know, I wasn\u2019t in public school, I was thrown out when I was seven years old. I hit a teacher, accidentally, you know. Not accidentally, sh -- a man was putting ink in the back of my head, a boy. And I told her, and she said -- and she didn\u2019t like it, because she knows I come from a better family. So she, \u201cYou keep quiet. You sit down.\u201d And it happened four times, I couldn\u2019t stand it any more. And you know the way they sit in Europe, you\u2019re a German, you know. The teacher sits in front before you go out the door. So I took my thing that I was writing in, my book -- my pad -- my notebook, and I took it and I hit it at her, and I said, \u201cI am leaving.\u201d And accidentally I hit her nose. Anyway, that\u2019s a long story, I\u2019m not going to get into it. I was thrown out of the school, and my grandfather had to pay a lot of money. He would have loved me to go to Hebrew school, but they -- they wouldn\u2019t take me in, so I went to komairts gimnasia, it was a Jewish private school. So I\u2019m telling you, I was a daredevil from the beginning. So as we come to that beautiful country Austria, I said, \u201cPapa, if you and Rocholla want to go on to Germany, go ahead. I\u2019m staying 1n this country in. Because they told us they are taking us to places where they put us up, and from there we\u2019ll be able to go to Palestine, and so on."

The food was also rationed, but it was good. We were DDT\u2019s, and so on. So again, I said, why should I take that. So I made friends with the American essing officer that distribute the food, and he had the -- the trucks and so on. I made friends with Dr. Dimetritus, because I helped him in -- that he was a Greek -- not Jewish, Greek that Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection run the -- the -- the hospital in the displaced camp, and also the head of the displaced camp.

And there were a lot of ma -- people sent to the displaced camp from Israel, they were called Sheliaks, to talk to the people how to get over to Palestine, and at that time. And I met with them, and I went out with them one night to a night club, that a friend of mine\u2019s mother owned it, Alonstra, it\u2019s in Linz, in Austria. And I get a call from the pharmacist, from the -- from the displaced camp. He says, \u201cMarsha, we are going to DDT the camp.\u201d Verkshide.

And I am going around, and I am spraying the barracks, and being very gentle about it, because it\u2019s my people, and everything, and all of a sudden I open a room, and the people are sitting, they are all dressed beautiful, drinking wine, having beautiful food and everything. And I got so mad that I pulled my mask down, and I start spraying the DDT at them. And one of them was my husband, Cornelius. And at that time he saw my eyes, he saw my face, and he said he fall in love with me. He was em -- then they liquidated Verkshide, and they send us to a much better displaced camp called Bindermichl.

Just go all over, all those things we\u2019re speaking, German, nothing, for me that doesn\u2019t exist. I want to go to art school.

So Dr. Dimitri, the doctor, fixed the f -- the -- the -- the poodle\u2019s foot. And I left him with Tommy, of course in Tommy\u2019s house, and I called him Tommy, because Tommy had some stomach trouble. He was a Jew from the University of Prague, and I called him Tommy. So I left him, and one day, one evening I went home, and I came home the next morning, and I want to go into his apartment, and his valet doesn\u2019t let me in. And I said, \u201cWhy, what\u2019s going on? I have to go in, I forgot something.\u201d Anyway, I had a lit -- bitty little fight with him, I went into the room, and my girls from the redhaired was sti -- the two dogs were lying next to the bed, and my girlfriend\u2019s from the CIC, re -- the redhead was sticking out of the bed.

He said, \u201cDo you sleep with him?\u201d My father was very outspoken with me. I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cYou know, a man needs it, and they need to get it somewhere. So he has your girlfriend handy, so he did it. I don\u2019t like Tommy, I don\u2019t want him to go out with you.\u201d I said, \u201cYou have nothing to say, Papa.\u201d I said, \u201cI do what I want, but I don\u2019t want to go back with him, I don\u2019t want anything to do with him.\u201d So one day I was out with the shleeoch dancing, and I get again a call. Tommy is very sick, he won\u2019t take any medicine, nothing. This was already Bindermichl. He won\u2019t take any medicine, nothing, till you come to see him. So I said to him, \u201cChaim, would you go with me?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, to save a person\u2019s life.\u201d So I went with him, and he took the medicine, and he got better, and I had to promise him, I said, \u201cLook, my father doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d right away I used my father. I don\u2019t even live with him, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want -- like you, doesn\u2019t want me to marry m -- y -- me. Why don\u2019t you go to Italy with the transport, and I\u2019ll meet you there afterwards?\u201d In the meanwhile, it\u2019s a long story, I met Cornelius. I thought I fall in love with him, and I thought to myself -- and he asked me to marry him. And he said, \u201cIt would be a good time. My two friends, my best two friends are coming back from Italy,\u201d they left to go to buna -- San Paolo, or Buenos Aires, I don\u2019t know where it was. \u201cThey\u2019re coming back, could we get married?\u201d And we got ma -- we were get -- we got married, and Barbie, she should [indecipherable] went back to Italy, and accidentally they met Tommy.

So she says -- Barbie, she says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your fianc\u00e9e just married our best friend.\u201d But before that I went with the opera singer from Romania. I went with the guy that went -- also from Romania, that went with the King sisters. And one woman was very jealous, and she said to my father, \u201cHow can you let her go out so much, with so many men?\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s better too many men than just one. So I\u2019m sure nothing will happen.\u201d And my father didn\u2019t have anything to say about who I'll go out or what I do anyway. But he liked Cornelius, I don\u2019t know why. And I said, \u201cYou know, Papa, he is half Jewish, he is not even Jewish.\u201d He says, \u201cYou will make something, I know you, you\u2019ll make him Jewish. Don\u2019t -- \u2019'm not worried about it.\u201d\u201d And he gave him -- I\u2019Il never forget -- my husband hates fish. And he gave him, he said, \u201cWould you like a drink with a piece of herring?\u201d Of course, Cornelius was a gentleman. You know, he was so debonair, I think that what impressed me, he wore that hat with the pipe, you know, he was very well dressed, I\u2019Il show you pictures.

But Cornelius made my father, and he made me quit it, because they saw -- there was a play -- I -- I don\u2019t have very perfect legs, so I always had to wear long clothes. So I played the maid in the kammershpeel -- you know how beautiful the kammershpeeler varm, with the chandelier, and everything. I played a maid the harem house. How do you Say it?

I didn\u2019t speak Hungarian, or Yugoslavian, or any other language, or English. He spoke 12 languages, I didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t that bright. I was bright, but not that bright.

And then we got a letter that in 1947, when we got married, his mother and father were supposed to go through Vienna. And I had a false passport, and he had a passport, and we were supposed to meet them in Vienna, and then the thing was changed, and they went through Prague, they went by plane. They shipped a lot of antiques, that my father- in-law was going to open an antique shop. I don\u2019t want to go into a big story about it, everything was stolen, and we couldn\u2019t rip -- we were making 30 dollars a week, and paid a private detective all over. Nothing was found except a couple of paintings that were between the bedding that came in those empty cases. So this is the first time I lost money, and I didn\u2019t feel sorry for me. I felt sorry for my mother-in-law, and father-in-law that had an estate with maids and chauffer, and two cars in Europe, you know what it means. A Fiat, and a Chevrolet for the boys. And ift -- went to San Marco when David -- when Connor was three years old, and all over Switzerland, and Cornelius went to -- to college in Budapest, and to Switzerland, and -- very, very rich people.

And we went on that boat. Then that was after -- we were married in 47, that was in August 1949. And we went on the boat, and being that Cornelius spoke so many languages, he was invited as a interpreter to speak over the tape recorder, and we came on the boat early. Came in on the boat early, I was made shtudmarder -- the head of that old woman, barra -- because the women and the men slept separate. And I met the two Ire officers. And like I said, I was pretty good looking, had a good sense of humor, knew how to dance, I won a couple of contested. And that rock and roll in Austria. Not Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection with Cornelius, he\u2019s a lousy dancer, with his friend. And being in the theater, you know, and everything. And I made very good friends with the Ire officer. And I got very sick going through the channel, very sick. And, you know, being that Cornelius was with the Joint, and part director of the Joint Distribution Committee, I got an apartment in the displaced camp that they had a telephone. And through that I met a lot of black marketeers. Ve -- he never did it, because he was afraid, God forbid, he couldn\u2019t go to America. So even when he lost all his money, he wrote a letter to his sister-in-law, did my tuxedo arrive? She s -- she wrote him back, \u201cCornelius, with all the money that you have now, you don\u2019t need a tuxedo.\u201d The first thing didn\u2019t bother him, the money, or the diamonds, or everything else, it bothered him is the tuxedo. So what happened 1s is that when we lived there, and we had that telephone, a lot of black marketeers would come over and make telephone calls, and everything else. And they went to England, and they brought me beautiful clothes, you know, as [indecipherable]. But I had a maid from Dabotchka, Maria, I\u2019ll never forget. And they would come in, and if I wasn\u2019t at home, and they would go into the kitchen in the displaced camp, I had a beautiful apartment -- Wiesenthal, from the -- from the Museum of Tolerance, lived above me. I gave him a party line, and I gave him a maid. And I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with that man if he said boo."

And I start throwing up. And that Ire officer was already a little bit in love with me, I had a feeling. So he came down to the thing, and he picked me up -- at that time I was only a size seven. I wasn\u2019t what I was right n -- he picked me up, in that pink robe [indecipherable] and he gave me his cabin, and he went to live with the other Ire officer.

And we live with my mother- in-law and father-in-law like I said, and they -- Connor was the youngest one, and I start working in a factory. We had to live, we had to eat. I start work in a factory, and what happened is is the foreman wan -- was on vacation -- like I say, I was very handy going -- working already on clothes, and everything. And the man that owned the place, his name was Rubin, I will also never forget, he came and he said to me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give out the work?

That man didn\u2019t ever know what a gun means, or anything at all the gun. And then my father-in-law would bring the papers and read it for me, because I wasn\u2019t that good in English that time, how many people were killed in motels, with guns, with that. And then I didn\u2019t want to tell him that I\u2019m sick, so I would throw up at night, because I couldn\u2019t take the sweat, the smell of the factory. Not that I was a snob, I just couldn\u2019t take it. And then Cornelius got another job with a friend, in -- with German lenses, through his brother.

And she would come down, and she would say, \u201cWhat do you think, what should we design?\u201d And she lived above, in the better area, over Sunset, at that time, on Clark Street. It -- it\u2019s sounded center now, where the Billage Hotel 1s, but 1t was at Clark Street at that time. And we moved out from my mother-in-law\u2019s, and everything they spend on us, we wrote it down, and the minute we made 200 dollars, we paid them all back. But what we did is - my teeth were all broken from the calcium I didn\u2019t have, and they worked on it in Austria, and they ruined it even more. So I went into a dentist that was down the street, on Santa Monica and Clark Street, someone sent me. There was a Thrifty drugstore, and his office was upstairs.

And what I did is, Cornelius went with me with the streetcar from Santa Monica to Hollywood, and every night after work, I went to Hollywood High.

And in 1978, when we opened the museum, I was chairing it, and that why I wanted to interrupt you to tell you, you are -- you also ask me why am I mad at Wiesenthal, and I want to tell you why. Because before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak for us. I shouldn\u2019t say that on tape, but I have to get it off my chest. And maybe I'll get fired for it, but I don\u2019t care. Before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak for us. Our chair was Mr. Silverman, American Jew, and we had a meeting in his house. And I don\u2019t -- I forget the name from the old man that came, and said that he got a letter from Wiesenthal that he wants five dollars per head more, like cattle. And we couldn\u2019t even afford it to open the museum, how can we afford to give him five dollar more to be our -- our speaker at the mu -- at the big dinner, at the opening. And then the Wiesenthal Center came to us -- that is now the Wiesenthal Center, with the proposition theyll give us 25,000 dollars for him. And being that we couldn\u2019t get it more from the federation, because they gave us a lot, we sold Wiesenthal for 25,000 dollars to the Wiesenthal Center. The Los Angel -- at that time we were the Martyr\u2019s Memorial, and the Holocaust Museum, we just changed our name to the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust because it\u2019s much easier to -- to get to understand it.

And let me tell you something, a very famous man from there, that helped build the museum, behind the synagogue in Moscow said that our museum is a Holocaust Museum, theirs is a Disneyland Holocaust. I\u2019m sorry to say it on tape, but this what it is, and if ever anybody hears it, please forgive me, if you\u2019re interested in the Wiesenthal Center, because it\u2019s strictly too much to do -- I\u2019m so -- corne --"

And he was -- I took him out -- he was about five pounds, because at that time they just build the Encino hospital, and it wasn\u2019t far from my -- from my studio. So what happened is 1s I got -- and it was Monday morning, I got terrible cramps, and I called a friend if she could take me.

I told him what happened, very slowly, and very quietly, because he didn\u2019t want to study for his Bar Mitzvah. I had to get a private rabbi. I did not belong to a temple, because -- this is another story by itself, I\u2019m not going to go into it. And I -- I ra -- I had the rabbi, I ha -- I hired the shul -- a temple, and he had the most magnificent Bar Mitzvah that ever -- he had everything -- at that time, everything was Calypso. And a friend of mine was in the linen supply business. Everything was served flamb\u00e9, and it was kosher, glot kosher, because at that time I knew a lot of survivors already, and some of them were very religious, and I wasn\u2019t going to commit a sin. So I found a place that was glot kosher, and it just opened, the Ventura Club. And -- but everything they gave you, they did your flowers, I didn\u2019t like. They gave me hundred dollar deposit, I paid 500 dollars for flowers. Imported hats from Mexico, with everything Calypso, every color. I didn\u2019t like his orchestra, so I had another one for the grownups. I changed everything around. They were supposed to do everything, I did everything. But I liked. But it was a beautiful Bar Mitzvah. And, in fact, David was mostly an atheist. But now, as he 1s getting older, 1s very, very Jewish inclined. And I never pushed him, and I never told him you have to be, because when came Christmas, we were at my mother-in-laws. Came Rosh Hashanah, we were at my house. My mother-in-law made the be -- on -- on Passover, the best matzo balls there is. And I never -- in fact, when my father-in-law had his first heart attack, he -- my mother-in-law was running up the street to call us, and she was crossing herself, and David was only going one way. She star -- she called me up, she said -- as sad as it was that -- where father is and everything, but said, \u201cI have to tell you something. David was going one way, and I said, David, why are you doing it?\u201d He said, \u201cAnya, I\u2019m half and half.\u201d You know, so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the -- the funny part that comes into a sad life."

And it\u2019s a town where it was the most famous yeshiva, Slabotka Yeshiva. Most of the finest rabbis came out, and my grandfather gave a lot of money for it. And he was very religious, and he was -- like I told you, I was his pet. And he was the first one to be taken away. With a hundred -- with 138, I don\u2019t know how much it here, but 103 degrees temperature. The first aktja that they had in the Kovno ghetto, they took away my grandfather, my grandmother, both of them, but the closest one I was to Shia and Bessa Schneider. And let me tell you -- my mother\u2019s family. And one time -- my girlfriend died of kidney when she was 38 years old, for a transplant, many, many years ago. And a very famous rabbi, Rabbi Newsbaum was at her home, but va -- he didn\u2019t go to ma -- many homes, but he came to Ethela\u2019s home. And I said, \u201cWhy, why the nice people die first?\u201d And he said to me, \u201cBecause God doesn\u2019t want them to suffer.\u201d I said, \u201cThat is no excuse.\u201d I said, \u201cI have never done anything, my two little sisters have never done anything 1n their life.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy did -- one was three years old, she didn\u2019t even have a chance to -- to suffer, or not to suffer. This is no answer, Rabbi.\u201d Then, when I came to the valley, and I was going to have David, I said, \u201cNow it\u2019s time to join a temple.\u201d I spent every penny to opening the studio. And Al and Juliet West, they helped me out, I told you. And I went to a very famous temple, I don\u2019t [indecipherable] to tell you, Rabbi Weiss. Later on I was with him on the same ticket speaking, with the federation, and then at -- at the big B\u2019nai Brith conference. He didn\u2019t recognize me when I came to the microphone. And I came to him, and I said, \u201cI would like to join your temple.\u201d And he said, \u201cIt cost 750 dollars to join the temple.\u201d And I said, \u201cIT can\u2019t afford it,\u201d [indecipherable] He said, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you look for another temple?\u201d And since then, I would never join a temple, and I was with him on one ticket that -- that -- at the federation I didn\u2019t say a word. But, when the aliyah start coming in from Russia, we had a big convention, B\u2019nai Brith convention, and I was there, and it was in the aisles microphones, and I came up, and I said, \u201cRabbi, you want us to make Jews out of the Russian people. They are coming so poor, and we have to make Jews out of them.\u201d I said, \u201cWasn\u2019t -- do you know me?\u201d He said, \u201cOh yes, Marsha, we were on the same ticket at the federation, at the ballroom.\u201d I said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t you remember in 1957 I came to you before my son was born, and I wanted to join your temple, and you said to me it cost too much money, I should look for another temple?\u201d I got such an applaud, 120 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection women were there.

She said, \u201cOh, you are really Myashka Supporzhnikov.\u201d That night I was invited to a very big affair, and I stopped off in a home before we -- we went to the party, and from then on I start meeting more and more survivors. I knew survivors, but I didn\u2019t really associate with them, because they were from Poland. I had nothing did -- I had -- we had nothing in common. So I met a lot of Lithuanian survivors. And this is -- I mean, my life was always the museum, and always the Holocaust. The first time I start talking was here in the valley. It was one time a very big tycoon, the Glickmans. He was in the eel -- real estate business, he was a multi-millionaire, lost a lot of money. He was 13 years old, and he had the havara group. Was many, many years ago, about 20 years, 30 years ago. And I went to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection their home, and a pr -- a -- a teacher from Grant High School at that time, they called it the bagel factory, it was a Jewish high school, and they were the first builders of the Stefan Weiss Temple, the Glickmans. And they called me over, they said, \u201cWould you talk to havara group, tell them your story?\u201d That was the first time I start talking about the Holocaust, it was about 32 years ago. When he brought me home, that professor, from- from Grant High School, he said to Cornelius, \u201cI created another billi -- Billy Graham.\u201d From that day on, I start talking about the Holocaust to everyone that will listen, and never stopped. And what happened is is -- but never, never did I tell anybody anything that they didn\u2019t want to hear. The only thing that is before I went to go to be citizen 1n -- and one of my clientele was a daughter-in-law of Professor J.C. Owens, he was the right hand of Hoover. And she said to me, \u201cIf you are going to be, be a Republican, not a Democrat.\u201d And Cornelius, and his mother, and everybody, big Democrats. I says -- I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d She said, \u201cIll bring you some documents, and I want Cornelius and you to read it together, because his English is a little bit better than yours.\u201d I said, \u201cThanks a lot Mrs. Owens, you just did me a big favor. In front of all my clientele, you are telling me that.\u201d She took it out of the safe, and she brought it to me, and I read the story, when Hoover was in 1938 in Europe, and he came back, and he asked Roosevelt to do something about the Jews that are being killed in Europe. He didn\u2019t come himself to Palo Alto, he sent somebody, and told them to inform Mr. Hoover that he cannot be bothered with a handle -- handful of Jews. And since then, I came into a friends of mine house, a survivor also from Lithuania, that had a big picture of hers -- over her fireplace of 53 60 Roosevelt, and that was in the 19 -- late 1950\u2019s, and I spit on his face, and she threw me out of her house. And now everything comes out in the open. What I knew in \u201953, is coming out now, with the boat, and with everything else."

Because a lot of people that work with me in the museum, that are in higher positions that I am, are very misunderstanding, and don\u2019t understand the feeling.

That person that runs that museum, I cannot mention name, is very jealous of me, because when it comes -- anything that has to do with museum, everybody knows me, the whole community. Starting from the federation, to the - to-- to black young adults, African American, to teachers, to everything else. Everybody knows me, and I hope they respect me, and that is the biggest problem.

We had breakfast with Elie Wiesel. I still have the picture of me and Elie Wiesel, and Freddie Diamond. And Elie Wiesel at that breakfast, was a very small breakfast from the federation, said that this was a jewel. We were on the 12\" floor of the Jewish Federation building.

And every year in February -- now I can\u2019t, because I work, we went, and when I had the money, and we helped Latka and Benjamin Meet send people all through the concentration camps, and Yad Vashem -- teachers, to be able to teach the Holocaust. When I started to -- not lecture, I don\u2019t call it a lecture -- talk about my experiences in the Holocaust -- I\u2019m not a lecturer, I\u2019m not a teacher. I -- 1t was done here a little bit, and there a little bit, and there a little bit, and people came by the hundreds to the museum when it first opened, because for them it was new. I was 10 days, I'll show you, from the president of the University of Utah, southern Utah. I was supposed to be 48 hours, I stayed for 10 days. I set up a Holocaust museum in the library, and the kids were coming down from the mountains, the Indian kids, and all kind of kids. And it was called Jewish week. And there was all different kind of illel, did a lot of cooking, and dancing, and so on. There was one Jewish students in the whole -- at that time it was a college, now it\u2019s a university. So -- and I paid for everything, and then there was a director from Yad Vashem working, Shome Balmar, at that time, at our museum, and I called, and I saw all those big people from Israel, from the American Jewish committee, and so on. So I -- right away I send him a ticket he should come right away to Utah. And then he lectured at the washing -- at the Einstein hall. So you see, whenever I talk, and whatever I do, I always end up Holocaust -- talking about the Holocaust, and what it should be done about the Holocaust. You know, about a couple of weeks ago, I couldn\u2019t get speakers. And the museum 1s small now, very small, because we are sharing till the other building is finished, we are sharing the whole first floor of a building with two other agencies of the federation, with the library, and the Jewish Historical Society. So, when they have a big group, we divide it in three parts. We send them to the monument, we have a big monument at Palm Pacific Park, that was built by survivors, and I was on the committee too. In fact, I\u2019m engraved in the committee. And we have the museum, so what we do is we divide it in three groups. And I couldn\u2019t get any speakers that day, so I spoke to three different groups at the same time, the same day. And worked."

            "answer": "The something that bothers me 1s that a lot of them are adding certain things that other people went through, that they discussed with. And that what bothers me when I was interviewing, because I read a lot about the Holocaust, even for the Polish people, and Auschwitz, and -- and Majdanek, and everything else. I worked with, \u201cThe Triumphant Spirit,\u201d with Nick Decalsio on the book. And it bothers me when people -- like take the Hungarians, from Budapest I\u2019m talking about. They didn\u2019t -- they -- they only start suffering in 1944, and they were put in the ghetto in 1944. But they also suffered, and a lot of them were killed in Auschwitz, and everything. But I don\u2019t think they went through the things that the people that went through -- that went through from 1939. Like, I couldn\u2019t say I went through like the Polish people that started 19 -- 9 -- \u201939, or the German Jews. But the German Jews, in the beginning, before the Kristallnacht still lived pretty good. You understand what I mean? And like again with the Anne Frank\u2019s diary. You take the Anne Frank\u2019s diary, there\u2019s hundreds of people that wrote diaries, but Anne Frank\u2019s diary was found first. And I want to tell you a story about Anne Frank\u2019s diary. My cousin, Leah Salisbury that converted to baptism -- I don\u2019t know what she converted, she married a guy -- she\u2019s my mother\u2019s cousin, she wasn\u2019t my cousin, she was the literary agent to Anne Frank\u2019s diary in -- in America. I never had a lot to do with her, because her mother was Jewish, and she didn\u2019t do it very much, she only had to do -- she only had to do with show people And she wanted me to come to her estate in -- in Sanvits shwanza, somewhere in New York, Connecticut, whatever it is -- I don\u2019t know what it -- what it is. I never went, because I didn\u2019t like it the way she treat her mother. It was her mother 80\" birthday, I was a youngster at that time, it was my mother\u2019s aunt. And I went there -- Aunt Molly, and her biggest pleasure was modeling, at 80 years old for the temple, and things like that. And no, Leah went, was stayed up 10 - 15 minutes, and she left. So when she send me tickets when Anne Frank\u2019s diary was here, as a theater in Los Angeles, I didn\u2019t go. And I don\u2019t really believe in Anne Frank\u2019s diary. I believe that it happened, of course, it did happen. But there is so many diaries been written, there\u2019s so many children been hidden, there\u2019s so many children been killed, like my two little sisters, one three years old, that was born in ghetto, that doesn\u2019t even know what it means that little piece of bread, one piece of fi -- a whole piece of bread, or a whole piece of -- of milk, or anything. But she knew every German. They were so smart, like God has give them more head, or something. Every German that walked by, she knew by name, when she was hidden. You know, because when they took away all the children, my biggest crime my mother committed is by hiding of my two little sisters. And that why she was killed at 34 years old, in Stutthof. I don\u2019t know, like I told you, where she was killed. Now that I read a lot more about -- when I start reading more about Theresienstadt, and Auschwitz, and everything that was going on, I don\u2019t know where she was killed."

If somebody -- if you have teacher training like we have in the museum every year, a teacher training, and we do it with different agencies, like the ADL, the labor committee, the American Bureau of Jewish Education, we do it together, and that is very important. Teacher training, so the teacher knew, when it comes to history, that, like the Spanish Inquisition, and the Crusaders, this also has to be told in history, because it happened, and it happened to a people, and for no reason at all. And it\u2019s good for the people in America to know it, because like I said, it\u2019s such a melting pot, that the people should get along together properly."

This only happened 50 some odd years ago, and believe me, much, much more that happened on Yom Kippur. And I think the Yom HaShoah is the most important thing, for any religion, or any people. It\u2019s important for us Jews, but a lot of people should come and see it, and hear it. Because this 1s like going to temple on - on Yom Kippur. This happened 2,000 years ago, but it\u2019s still the tradition, and we still do it. And people stand in line to get tickets to go to it. But the Yom HaShoah only happened 56 years ago, and six million of our people were killed. And that is -- that is our yom -- that is my Yom Kippur. Do you know in the beginning, before the survivors start dying off, I was jealous of a funeral, I told you on the tape. You know. And now, I\u2019m afraid to go to funerals. I\u2019m afraid to pick up the telephone, because the survivors are going so fast. And that why the testimony is so important, it\u2019s very important, that it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. Look at what happened to the Spanish Inquisition. What do you read in the dictionary? A date, a time, what happened, and finished with. Are there books on it? Not many. And look at what happened, and it\u2019s practically forgotten. This will never be forgotten, as long as I can help it."

We were supposed to go out for Thanksgiving. So now I said forget it. If I want to play cards, I go to one of the casinos, and that\u2019s all -- they\u2019re here in Los Angeles. I don\u2019t have to go and see those -- that they spend thousand -- there\u2019s so many thousands of homeless people lying around the streets all over America, and they\u2019re building millions and millions of dollars hotels in Las Vegas. Not that we don\u2019t need it, we need that too, but there 1s a limit to everything. Yesterday I went shopping. There were standing people, and collecting for AIDS, near Juan\u2019s. So I sent Cornelius in to get canned food for them. And I tried to give as much as I can. When I had the money, everybody got. But now I try to give as much as I can. In fact, somebody told me I\u2019m too generous. Because when I drive by in the morning, I drive by a bakery that has bagels, and I had on a -- a -- a department in the federation, they used that I bring them bagels and cream cheese in the morning, for the department. So if -- if I can -- now we are separated, the federation and the museum, and in different places till the building is redone. So now I have to wait till somebody comes to pick it up, or I run over and take it over. And this is my biggest pleasure, even if it costs me money, that I work, and it comes to me very hard.
