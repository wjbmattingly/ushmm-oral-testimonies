            "question": "And when did liberation come for you, and what was it like? What state of mind, what physical health were you in, and where were you?",
            "answer": "I was liberated in a silo after the last march called Chinno, that a lot of ki -- little camps out of Stutthof were concentrated. An d the two typhuses broke out. And to tell you the honest truth, I don\u2122t remember when I was liberated. I thought they were burning down the silo, so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead around me, and I woke up in a German house, with the Russian\u2122s doctor taking care of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 3me. I had the two typhuses. And then they shav ed my head again, and they put a salve on it, and I looked like musselwoman. And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize anything. And after three days, or a week, I d on\u2122t know exactly, they told us we have to leave that village, because the front is coming on. So we should walk to Lomborg. Lomborg is in Polmarin. And it was not far from Chinno. And as we were walking, I with a little friend of mine holding a hand, we sa w two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will never forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers, and we asked them to take us to Lomborg, and you know we covere d our head with -- with scarves, and we -- they shouldn\u2122t notice that we have typhus. And they said, \ufb01No, we cannot do it, because we are not allowed to.\ufb02 But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us behind, in that little carriage, but they said, \ufb01The first house in Lomborg, you have to get out.\ufb02 So, as we came into Lomborg, the first house, they said in -- in Russian, out. So, we went out, and the first house we walked in . And all I can remember is everything was empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don\u2122t know, at that time I didn\u2122t know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else. And in the middle was standing a bottle, with blueberries. And I didn\u2122t know it was preserve, or something. There was no water in that house, nothing. And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out. And sh -- she said, \ufb01Shall we drink it?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I am afraid it may be poisoned.\ufb02 Left poison, there\u2122s that bottle standing there, there\u2122s no water, there\u2122s nothing. And then we couldn\u2122t stand it any more, and what happened is is we dr ank, and we ate those blueberries. And at that time I was so USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 4young, I didn\u2122t know nothing. La ter on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we felt so much better, that it was fermemented. It was set up fo r wine, or something, and it helped the temperature. And our temperature dropped. We s -- we went around, and we looked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized some people from my hometown, and they wa s already looking -- you know, after two weeks, three weeks, they\u2122re grown up people. And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for them, because the Russians are going on the front to Lomborg, and they were raping the women. German, Jewish, it didn\u2122t matter. They were getting drunk and raping them. So what they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their apartment where they lived, six women. And if you put a sign up that it\u2122s typhus, the Russians didn\u2122t care, they just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos. And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave me a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the front room, and turn on the light, and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick with the salve on my head. They start runni ng. And this is how I saved six women from being raped by the Russians. Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going down the stairs, and there was a little pond near that apartment, and there wasn\u2122t that much water, and anything, and I thought I\u2122ll wash out my -- whatever I have, in that pond. And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 5He said, \ufb01Ateeja dofka.\ufb02 I mean, am -- am I Jewish. And I said yes. He said, \ufb01I am too, from Odessa, don\u2122t get scared.\ufb02 So I took him up in to the apartment where the girls were. They saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, \ufb01Are you out of your mind?\ufb02 You know, they dragged me back in the othe r room. And it so happened that it -- he was there for two weeks. He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me. He gave me even a wedding band. And I wasn\u2122t even 15 years old yet. But nobody knew that. And he says to me he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la -- his father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up. And I thought to myself, \ufb01Let him talk.\ufb02 But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two weeks he slept in the front room of our apar tment, so nobody could get in. And when he left, we went to work in a hospital, to help the Russian soldiers. So we slept there, so nobody could touch us there either. And one day a man came up to me, and he said, \ufb01Akeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?\ufb02 Am I Ma rsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma -- Marioshka Supporzhnikov. And I said yes. \ufb01My son wrote a letter at home that you are here in Lomborg, and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the hospital. I would like to send you to Odessa. He wants to marry you.\ufb02 And I told him, I said, \ufb01I cannot do it. I have to go back home first. I have to se e where my -- if I have any family left, I have anything,\ufb02 I said. He said, \ufb01Do you love my son?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I don\u2122t know him well enough. I don\u2122t know what love is.\ufb02 I s -- I -- he didn\u2122t know my age, he didn\u2122t know nothing. Nobody know nothing about anybody. And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age, because my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15. And I -- so even USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 6after I was liberated, I was afraid to tell my age. So, even to that man that was the fa -- and I asked him, I said -- this may not be in terested on the tape, but I asked him, I said, \ufb01Tell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different town than your son is, and you\u2122re not even Jewish?\ufb02 Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name was, I don\u2122t even remember, and he says, \ufb01You see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and doctors, and send us to different places, because when we were caught from the Germans, that the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn\u2122t give us ou t that we are Jews on top of it.\ufb02 So this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn\u2122t the only one that suffered, and there were other people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my mind. And we felt better, and we didn\u2122t kn ow there was [indecipherable] existed. We didn\u2122t know about people not going back home or nothing. A ll I want is to go home, and see what\u2122s happened."

            "question": "Would you let me ask you just one quick question. Did you know anything about your family members at that point? Are -- you know your sist -- your two sisters -- you said your two sisters were --",
            "answer": "My two little sister, my mother, was taken away in Stutthof. I didn\u2122t know if they are -- were dead, or alive, or nothing. I had a feeling that they were killed there. All taken to Theresienstadt. Now that I read the books about it, ther -- and then from there to Auschwitz. I don\u2122t know what happened to them. I can only tell you I lost them, about maybe a week after we were in Stutthof. But the only thing that bothered me is that they were taken out of the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and given civilian clothes when they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 7were taken away. And when I wanted to go with them, they left a big dog on me, this is all in my other tape. And all I wanted to go and see if anybody was left. I was -- my father was in Dachau. I know my grandfathers were taken away in the beginning, and -- and this -- I knew they were dead. My other family -- certain family members were all dead, because I know they were taken on the ninefort and killed in Kovno, of the Kovno ghetto. And anybody did nothing -- not many people escaped from the ninefort. But the thing is is, is -- what I want to tell you is that I wanted to go home. So they said yes, they\u2122ll s -- they\u2122ll s -- put us on trains, and they\u2122ll send us home. So they put us on big trucks, and they took us to a place, a good -- I don\u2122t know how to say it in English, a ranch, a big ranch in -- in Palmerton, it was near Nimitz, near -- not far from Stetlin, not far from Lomborg, Rigenwald, Lomborg, and so on. And they took us there, and there were some Russian girls, white Russian girls, they were playing the piano. And the Jewish girls, the one that went with the Germans -- and the Jewish girls, they put us to clean up stalls, and they put us to -- to -- to -- to -- to the dirtiest work in the world. They didn\u2122t give us enough food, the Russians. Th ey didn\u2122t kill us, they didn\u2122t beat us, but there was a -- they -- we -- we -- we were always watched, we were always watched with guards, like in the [indecipherable]. The only difference was that we weren\u2122t beaten up, we weren\u2122t treated as dirty Jews, but we were treated different. There were about maybe 10 Jewish girls. And one day the captain aske d me if I -- asked anybody if they would like to go to learn with veterinarian. There is a doctor in Rigenwald that will teach veterinarian, because what they were doing is taking the cows and the horses of the fields USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 8that were running wild. And they opened a conzerr factory, and they open a cheese factory. And what they did is, they needed the cows to be healthy, to see if they\u2122re healthy, they take -- to take analysis fro m horses -- I found that out later, when I came back. I said, \ufb01I\u2122m going.\ufb02 Like in German concentration camp, in those little camps, if they needed somebody to go to threshing, f -- harvesting or something, people were sent to s -- Auschwitz. I didn\u2122t care any more when they took away my mother, my two little sisters, and the rest of my fam ily. So I was the first one, I -- he sa -- I said, \ufb01I am going to Rigenwald.\ufb02 We came to Rigenwald, the doctor that they sent to teach us, it must have been from different camps around that, but from our camp we went only one Russian girl, and two Jewish girls. And what happened is is that -- what\u2122s so amazing is that the doctor was a drunk. He was compl -- always drunk. And we learned some. We learned how to protect when a cow is slaughtered, to recognize if it has tuberculosis around the lungs. We learned how to take analysis from a horse\u2122s neck. We learned ho -- if they got this eye sickness, the horses, to get rid of them. We learned the cows, they had a certain thing on their skin, to put them -- what is the end of a -- of a match called? It\u2122s a certain chemical. Put them in a tent, and put them into the chemical. So get away the sickness shouldn\u2122t spread. We learned certain things in -- in about three weeks, but the most important thing for me was that I made friends with the put -- Polkolvnik\u2122s wife, with the main man\u2122s wife. I must have had in me pa-par t of it of my father, like I said before. She went in a nightgown to the opera, and [indeci pherable] others. I -- I told her that\u2122s not proper. I told her your hair doesn\u2122t look, let me comb it for you. We got to be the best of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 9friends, I and the Pot -- Polkolvnik\u2122s wife. And they treated me like a daughter the two weeks I was -- three weeks we were there. After three weeks we got a paper with a pitshot, you know, with the stamp, like the Russians always do. Akivia trinarn inyarz. I was a veterinarian nurse, believe it or not. We came into that village again, we worked. We worked with the horses, we worked this. Two weeks later, after we came back from Rigenwald, they put -- Polkovnik and his wife arrived in th at good -- in that trench. There was a very, very ugly captain that run it, and he hated Jews, very anti-Semitic. And he said, \ufb01Akdere Marouska?\ufb02 Where is marsh -- Marouska. And the captain said, \ufb01In her room with the other Jewish girl.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01In her room? You mean to tell me she doesn\u2122t have an apartment of her own?\ufb02 And his wife got very mad. He said, \ufb01I want to call her immediately for dinner, to have dinner with us.\ufb02 Because there was dinner in the captain\u2122s house. It\u2122s a bi -- in the good -- you know, in the ranch, the big ranch house. So when he called me in, I had dinner with them , and he gave a order to the captain that I have to have my own apartment, that I have to be in charge of the cheese factory. I have to be sent to a different village. But in a couple of weeks, till they have everything prepared, and -- now, don\u2122t forget , in July atel -- I was liberated in March, and July atel 15. And what happened is is before I left fo r the other -- good for the other ranch, big ranch, the Jewish girls were playing a piano, and the Russian girls were cleaning the stalls. But what they did is, I was there to be heavily guarded, because they would have killed me, the Russian girls. So what happened is is when I went to that good, I arrived, and I was all of a sudden I was in charge of a milk factory -- cheese factory, and at night USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 10the Russian soldiers from all around, from the good that I worked in, the ranch, from all the ranches they would come, and -- and Polis h soldiers they would come, and I would give them all cheeses and milk, cause the Russ ian soldiers weren\u2122t fed either. They would cut around the tuberculosis, around the cows, and then they would make like a soup with potatoes, and every -- that all they had to eat all day. Everything was shipped to Russia. And what happened is is that they liked me very much the Russian soldiers, and the Polish soldiers came, and there came some fliers from Stettlin, and they would bring liquor and so on. But one thing would happ en, when they woul d get too drunk, the woman that owned that ranch was a very, very wealthy woman. That\u2122s the first time I ate waffles in my life, because she had the st ove that she moved waffles around. She was from Pullman. She was German, from Pullman, and she was like a mother to me. So the minute she saw that they got drunk, she lock me upstairs in one of the quarters, and nobody could get near me. But I did a lot of things in that camp that a child of my age wouldn\u2122t do. I was boar hunting, believe it or not. I was boar hunting with the Russians, with the Polish officers. I -- I did everything I wanted. I run that village. And I was ride out, with the guard of course, I would ride out to the fields, and check up on the pomeron women, and see the German women, and see how they milked the cows, if they are clean in the fields and so on."

            "answer": "Not very long -- didn\u2122t take me very long to build up, to feel sorry for those kids, and take them food, and take them medicine, and steal from the Russians. And one day the captain came to me, and that -- this is a really funny story. He came to me to my village. And he says, you know there was a befell -- wa s like when there\u2122s a order that the -- the Russians can take nothing away animal from the Germans. Absolutely nothing, no cows, no horses, nothing. And the eye sickness of th e horses, I forgot how it was called. I was never a veterinarian, so I forgot it. Broke out and we lost seven horses, and they put -- Polkovnik was coming, and he said, \ufb01Your village is full of horses.\ufb02 He\u2122s talking to a grown up person, you know. \ufb01I need seven horses.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Fine, I\u2122ll give you seven horses. You release seven see -- seven girls from the -- that you\u2122re holding. If you put them on the train, I\u2122ll give you seven.\ufb02 Said, \ufb01I can\u2122t do that many, but I\u2122ll release some.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Okay.\ufb02 So how do I do it? I have to have a plan. So I sat down, and I talked to the German woman that took care of me, and I ma de myself a plan. I am -- I got a lot of fantastic liquor from those majors that came , from the -- the pilots from Stettlin. And I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 12invited seven officers from the Polish camp. An d we got them so drunk that they were flat on the floor. We took off their uniforms, there were waiting seven Russian soldiers. We put the Polish uniform on the Russian soldier, and the Russian soldiers, they went out, they got the seven horses, came back, got them dressed back their uniform, dropped them on a cart, and took them back to their camp. The next thing the rumor was in the village that the Polish army stole seven horses. Now I had something over that captain. He was so afraid of me that you have no idea. Because God forbid he should go to the higher ups, and everything. So everything I wa nted, I got. So when the soldiers from each camp, when I rode with them, wanted to come and eat at my camp, they came and eat. If they wanted to -- whatever they wanted to -- the Jewish girls lived the life of Riley, and he was afraid of me as hell. One day I was riding with a man from Georgia, I\u2122ll never forget, and a short Jewish man came up to me, and in Jewish says to me, \ufb01Are y -- do you know anybody by the name of Myashka Suppor zhnikov?\ufb02 And I said to him like that. I put my hand to my throat, my mouth, and I said, \ufb01Oh please don\u2122t say anything.\ufb02 And the Russian soldier understood what he said, or he had a feeling. He said, \ufb01Marouska, don\u2122t worry. Anything you want I\u2122ll do for you, because you saved my life, you got some medicine when I was sick. You brought food fo r me. I will help you with anything I can.\ufb02 A very, very lo -- I couldn\u2122t say low [indecipherable] because he was intelligent, with intelligent you have to be born. Very average person, you know? And I couldn\u2122t understand why he does it. And he said, you know what? So I tell him the story, that I found out from that man that my father is alive in L\u00f3dz, in Poland, and he came to pick USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 13me up. So he said to me, \ufb01Not only will I take you -- let you go, but I\u2122ll take you to the train.\ufb02 And I want to tell you something. Wh en we came into the villages, the houses were empty, but there was so much clothes, and jewelry, and cameras. With everything was in my apartment, when I was riding on th at horse, I didn\u2122t even have a sweater on. I\u2122ll never forget, I had the silk, maroon blouse on. I remember now, I didn\u2122t remember before, riding boots, and -- and they\u2122re real good boots, because one of the officer, police officer, brought it to me, and riding pants. That\u2122s all I had with me, because I was going with him to check out the fields, how the milk is going, how everything is going. And I said, \ufb01Okay. You are taking me to the train, but I\u2122m going to give you a letter. And when the captain does something to you, you tell him, \u201aI have a letter from Maroushka about the seven horses.\u2122 \ufb02 I said, \ufb01At least I can do for you that you don\u2122 t get punished, or put in jail, or anything like that.\ufb02 So what I did is I -- I still wrote Russian at that time, I sat down, and in no time I wrote him a letter. He took us to the train. And that man says to me, \ufb01Now remember, I am Polish, I speak very good Polish, your father send me, and I want you to be like you\u2122re -- you don\u2122t know how to speak, you don\u2122t know how to -- you\u2122re -- you\u2122re dumb. Whatever anybody says, you just move your head.\ufb02 Because at that time, the Polish Akar, the Polish fascists were killing the Jews like crazy, especially on trains, and so on. And I listened to him, a nd he might -- I don\u2122t even [indecipherable] I was freezing a little bit. And I went to -- we went with the train and we arrived in L\u00f3dz."

            "answer": "So I arrived in L\u00f3dz, and my father, and everybody, we were partying, and of course I was smoking, like I said, and my father said, \ufb01You can\u2122t smoke,\ufb02 and I said, \ufb01Yes I can.\ufb02 And anyway, he did not have a big control over me, that I have to say. And it was very sad. And for one reason my father didn\u2122t have a big control over me, and I hate to say it, my father was a very selfish man, and I remembered him from ghetto, what he did to us. And I really -- I loved my father, but I didn\u2122t lik e him. I\u2122m sorry to say this, should rest in USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 16peace. And what happened is is that in L\u00f3dz he says to me -- he -- he knew that my mother is dead, and he got himself a girlfriend, a friend of my mothers, that she lost her husband and two kids, also in the Kovno ghetto. And what happened is is that he says to me, \ufb01I have enough money to smuggle th e border.\ufb02 Now he-here he helps all the strangers, and his only leftover child, he says, \ufb01I have enough money to smuggle the border for me and Rocholla. I don\u2122t have en ough money for you.\ufb02 So what do I do? I went into the kibbutz, in -- to work in the hospital b ecause I know how to give a injection, you know, I learned a little bit there at the Russian camp, by working with the animals, it\u2122s not that different to give a injection, and take a temperature, and so on. So I went into the kibbutz, and I stay ed in the kibbutz, and I learned how to -- in L\u00f3dz -- and I worked in the hospital, and in Madrid the head of the kibbutz came to me, and he says, \ufb01Marsha,\ufb02 -- now, nobody knew my age. I - I looked so much older than I am, thanks God, that why I was alive -- I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s thanks God or not. And he says to me, \ufb01You know what,\ufb02 he says, \ufb01you want to go -- get over on th e other side?\ufb02 I says, \ufb01Yes, I want to get away from L\u00f3dz,\ufb02 because I was engaged to a man that was 34 years old, and I was not -- I was 15. He gave a diamond watch to a friend of my fathers, to introduce us. And he was so jealous when I went away on business or something in L\u00f3dz, and when he came back and I wasn\u2122t home, he was running all over, looking for me. And I had already my wedding dress, because he impressed me so tremendously. You know, coming out of the concentration camps, coming out of that place, that Russian camp, and everything, and he brought me presents, and -- and he took me to pl aces, but I could not speak USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 17Jewish, and I could not speak any other language with him. So he said, \ufb01I will do the speaking, you keep quiet, Marous ka.\ufb02 And that -- that was it. So he impressed me with all the diamonds, and all the sweaters, and -- and he was a very, very rich man."

Not ma ny people could go to a movie in 1940s -- end of 1945, beginning of 1946 . They couldn\u2122t go to a movie. They couldn\u2122t walk the streets and speak Yiddish. Absolutely not, Jewi sh. So what happened is is he impressed me with all those things, and I was going to ma rry him. Then -- and then I realized it, oh my gosh, I can\u2122t marry that man, that man is - could -- is older -- practically as old as my father, he is jealous, I don\u2122t have no friends, I can\u2122t make any friends. Now this is me thinking, a youngster, a teenager. And I said, \ufb01I have to get away from him.\ufb02 So on our engagement party at this cousin \u2122s estate in L\u00f3dz, I dance with his best friend, a Jew from the Polish army, and I came back to the couch, and he doesn\u2122t want to talk to me. So I said to the friend, \ufb01Chaim, give me my cape.\ufb02 And I took my cape, and I went to my father\u2122s house. And I said, \ufb01Would you like to go to Bratislav right now,\ufb02 the next morning?

He said to me -- I said to him, \ufb01I\u2122ll take that transport. But my father and my stepmother go,\ufb02 -- I -- I mi -- I called her my stepmother, she wasn\u2122t yet -- \ufb01goes with me.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01Okay, it\u2122s arranged.\ufb02 Because it so happened that the people that were supposed to take me -- it, the couple don\u2122t feel so hot."

            "answer": "Yeah. The ide -- I don\u2122t know. We had to ge t out of L\u00f3dz. Oh, yes, the idea to go to Palestine was from the beginning. To go to Pales tine, that was my ideal thing. So here we are, we\u2122re ready, and everybody, I\u2122m taking 25 people over the border to Bratislav. From L\u00f3dz to Bratislav, the Akar shooting after us. Now, I want to tell you, my stepmother Rocholla, was with me in the same camp, and I helped her stay behind, because she froze her feet up. My feet were frozen, too. They took off her fingers from one foot, in L\u00f3dz, and she couldn\u2122t walk that fast. They wanted to take some of my toes off, and I wouldn\u2122t let them, because the doctor said there\u2122s a chance that they can heal that. So I went for therapy, and what I did is, I washed floors, I did everything to pay the doctor. And the doctor gave me therapy, hot and cold baths, and salves, and everything, and it starts -- it looked like I had a fungus on my foot, but it start healing. And I could walk. And then when I went into the kibbutz, the kibbutz pa id part of it. So, in about two and a half months, my feet were ready to go. And I had those -- they got me orthopedic shoes at the kibbutz, and I went. And as we were going, what I wanted to tell you, I run away from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 19that guy -- later on I heard he had a nervous breakdown, I don\u2122t know about that one. But I want to tell you the Akar, you couldn\u2122t go to a movie, you couldn\u2122t go to a restaurant if you were Jewish, if you spoke Jewish. They a -- every day they had something happen Jew in L\u00f3dz. One was shot in a -- in a bus stop, the other one was deesent, it was terrible. For me, it was a terrible thing, because as ba d as the Russian was, they never beat us, they never hurt us, they never shot us. So I went and I took that transport. And the Akar was shooting after us. It was in the middle of the night. And I -- ed -- everybody slowed down, and they were mad at me because of my stepmother. It didn\u2122t take long we arrived in Bratislav. Arrived in Bratislav, my father never said thank you to me for taking him, and everything else, but they put us on trains to go to Germany, and to go -- and it so happened that we went through Austria with the train. And they said, \ufb01Who would like to stay in Austria?\ufb02 And I saw those beautiful mountains, and that b eautiful scenery, and like I told you, at the Russian camp I was boar hunting, and I was riding, and I loved sports. Even as a child, when I was eight years old, I was at the school Olympics, you know. So what happened is is that I was a daredevil. I was a -- like I\u2122m a tomboy when I was a youngster. Because there was a certain branch out from my wer -- my grandfather from my mother\u2122s side was a very well-to-do man, and I was hi s angel. It\u2122s supposed to be a boy, but still he called me by a boyish name, Yankela. But I was his life. So what I mean is that I -- I -- from th e beginning, you know, I wasn\u2122t in public school, I was thrown out when I was seven years old. I hit a teacher, accidentally, you know. Not accidentally, sh -- a man was putting ink in the back of my head, a boy. And I told her, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 20and she said -- and she didn\u2122t like it, because she knows I come from a better family. So she, \ufb01You keep quiet. You sit down.\ufb02 And it happened four times, I couldn\u2122t stand it any more. And you know the way they sit in Europe, you\u2122re a German, you know. The teacher sits in front before you go out the door. So I took my thing that I was writing in, my book -- my pad -- my notebook, and I took it and I hit it at her, and I said, \ufb01I am leaving.\ufb02 And accidentally I hit her nose. Anyw ay, that\u2122s a long story, I\u2122m not going to get into it. I was thrown out of the school, and my grandfather had to pay a lot of money. He would have loved me to go to Hebrew school, but they -- they wouldn\u2122t take me in, so I went to komairts gimnasia, it was a Jewish private school. So I\u2122m telling you, I was a daredevil from the beginning. So as we come to that beautiful country Austria, I said, \ufb01Papa, if you and Rocholla want to go on to Germany, go ahead. I\u2122m staying in this country in. Because they told us they are taking us to places where they put us up, and from there we\u2122ll be able to go to Palestine, and so on."

The food was also rationed, but it was good. We were DDT\u2122s, and so on. So again, I said, why should I take that . So I made friends with the American essing officer that distribute the food, and he had the -- the trucks and so on.

So I\u2122m sure nothing will happen.\ufb02 And my father didn\u2122t have anything to say about who I\u2122ll go out or what I do anyway. Bu t he liked Cornelius, I don\u2122t know why.

It was between the strip and Santa Monica, and at that time the strip was the place. There was the -- the mola -- th-the LaRue, there was the Mocambo, Ciro, everythi ng was there. And that was the place there, a main shop, and the factory downstairs, and I worked there. She was very good to me, very good to me, because I caught on just like that, one, two, three. And she would come down, and she would say, \ufb01W hat do you think, what should we design?\ufb02 And she lived above, in the better area, over Suns et, at that time, on Clark Street. It -- it\u2122s sounded center now, where the Billage Hotel is, but it was at Clark Street at that time. And we moved out from my mother-in-law\u2122s, a nd everything they spend on us, we wrote it down, and the minute we made 200 dollars, we paid them all back. But what we did is - my teeth were all broken from the calcium I didn\u2122t have, and they worked on it in Austria, and they ruined it even more.

And we got to be the best of friend. This were our first friend in America, the Vestliss. And what happened is is my father-in-law went in the basement in the May Company right there, and bought me a black dress, we were going out, so what I did is, I had a colorful scarf -- because the clothes that I brought from Europe, I couldn\u2122t wear, with those big pads. Connor\u2122s shoes were squeak -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 41squeaking, you know. It was complete different life, a complete different scene. And these were people that already had catalogs, and -- and -- and live -- lived in Beverly Wood, in Beverly Hills, in the valley, and so on. And eve -- they got to be very good friends of mine. And I was working at Suzy\u2122s , and Suzy went to Paris. And her husband, that was a very good looking man went afte r me, and I had to quit. And I didn\u2122t worry, because I had a job waiting for me at Sidney\u2122s. And Sidney on LaSeneca was also one of the most exclusive -- and all I needed, clothes. Now, when I was at Suzy\u2122s, I went -- I met Marlena Dietrich, I met all the movie star s. Marlena Dietrich, I called her a whore, because she -- I didn\u2122t -- wasn\u2122t afraid of her, because she didn\u2122t pay her bills anyways [indecipherable] I -- I -- I said -- I didn\u2122t know what\u2122s the different is in English between Madame and Madame at that time.

I said, \ufb01Suzy, the Madame is here.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01In America we say Madame.\ufb02 Say -- and I knew that she understood German , and Suzy was from Austria, her father was a Austrian actor, so I, \ufb01Suzy, the hura is here.\ufb02 The whore is here, in German."

And at that time, it was not modern, wooden floors, but it was wooden floors, we shined it. And we had red couches with pink troracks. And we didn\u2122t have a dining, we just had a dining area. And all my friends that lived in Beverly Hills, and everywhere USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 43else, they liked to come to -- to my house to eat, because I learned how to cook from my mother-in-law. She wa -- she went to Budape st to study cooking business, to teach the cooks how to cook. So I got to be a very good cook, so everybody liked to come to my house.

And what I did is, Cornelius went with me with the streetcar from Santa Monica to Hollywood, and every night after work, I went to Hollywood High. And then, without knowing any survivors or anything, somebody told me they are going to build a monument, a nd they are having a meeting on Vermont. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 46Holocaust monument. So I went there, and I s -- the meeting, and all of a sudden, my part of the committee.

And in 1978, when we opened the museum, I was chairi ng it, and that why I wanted to interrupt you to tell you, you are -- you also ask me why am I mad at Wiesenthal, and I want to tell you why. Because before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak for us. I shouldn\u2122t say that on tape, but I have to get it off my chest. And maybe I\u2122ll get fired for it, but I don\u2122t care. Before we opened the museum, Mr. Wiesenthal was supposed to speak for us. Our chair was Mr. Silverman, American Jew, and we had a meeting in his house. And I don\u2122t -- I forget the name from the old man that came, and said that he got a letter from Wiesenthal that he wants five dollars per head more, like cattle. And we couldn\u2122t even afford it to open the museum, how can we afford to give him five dollar more to be our -- our speaker at the mu -- at the big dinner, at the opening. And then the Wiesenthal Center came to us -- that is now the Wiesenthal Center, with the proposition they\u2122ll give us 25,000 dollars for him. And being that we couldn\u2122t get it more from the federation, because they gave us a lo t, we sold Wiesenthal for 25,000 dollars to the Wiesenthal Center. The Los Angel -- at that time we were the Martyr\u2122s Memorial, and the Holocaust Museum, we just changed our name to the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust because it\u2122s much easier to -- to get to understand it. And that\u2122s why Wiesenthal for me is absolutely poo, and the reas -- I have been once at the Wiesenthal Center, and that was with a delegation -- this comes later -- with a delegation from -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 47from Russia, that came to see what we did, and they saw our museum, they saw the Wiesenthal museum. And let me tell you someth ing, a very famous man from there, that helped build the museum, behind the synagogue in Moscow said that our museum is a Holocaust Museum, theirs is a Disneyland Holocaust. I\u2122m sorry to say it on tape, but this what it is, and if ever anybody hears it, please forgive me, if you\u2122re interested in the Wiesenthal Center, because it\u2122s strictly too much to do -- I\u2122m so -- corne --"

Also, when -- if you hear my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 48tape in -- in the museum, they took me into a room, and they looked for gold. And I was very young, and they did some thing there, so it was very -- the doctor didn\u2122t want -- they didn\u2122t want me -- but I wanted a child, because when my father -- in \u212257 they brought my father, that survived Dachau. I worked so hard for the Gateway of Mental Health hospital in Los Angeles. I and Cornelius were fundraising in the valley. So they surprised me on a television show. It was called at that time, \ufb01It Could Be You.\ufb02 And they told me I was going to have -- announce my fashion show, cause I\u2122m giving for Gateway for mental health. And they came to pick me up, and then they su rprised me with my father. And what happened is my father came, and he came into the -- to my house, and he says, \ufb01Oh, a Jewish girl, a bizdatnitsi, no children.\ufb02 And it practically killed me. So -- and then my mother-in-law and father-in-law was in a very, very bad accident, and the two sons were so good, and they were so terrific, and that day I decided -- and I knew my mother was -- just has to snap a finger, she had a baby. I remember this as a child, and in ghetto, she wa -- a ba -- baby was born. She was made before the ghetto, was born in ghetto. And I said to myself, \ufb01I\u2122m going to get pregnant, I\u2122m gong to trick him into it.\ufb02 And I got pregnant. And being that I am a designer, I wore a certain kind of clothes, that he never noticed it till about the third or fourth month, and then I told him. And I wouldn\u2122t go to a gynecologist, but again, one of my model\u2122s husband\u2122s was a very famous gynecologist. He also charged me a big amount, because he thought I was so filthy rich, because of my studio, and his wife models for me. And I went to him, and I was pregnant, and all through the pregnancy we -- we did out garden in our home -- in our new home, and we USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 49did -- the front we added landscape, I -- landscaper. I was bleeding, and I never told the doctor, and I never told -- and David was bor n prematured. And I had the dachshund at that time that was sick. And -- and I had my little house on Bervis in Van Nuys. And I opened in \u212253 ti -- my studio, ameet studio in Sherman Oaks. And when I opened the studio is my friend the Vestliss\u2122, they he lped me, and who went looking with me, Elizabeth, because they had a big drugstore in the valley, and we found that place, and it was -- and I remodeled it in a early American, because I loved the early American, because that for me presented the country that I came, and that gave me a home. And even in my house, in my first house, I ha d the early American. In my little apartment behind the studio, I had the early American with the hooked rug. And now I go a little more modern. I got used to America. Anyway, and what happened is is that I -- I -- I got pregnant, and I worked, and like I said, I brought my father out, and it upset me, and then when my mother-in-law was in the accident, I said when I\u2122m gone there wa -- nobody going to be left, I have to have something. And I stuck it out, and David was born in the eighth month. And he was -- I took him out -- he was about five pounds, because at that time they just build the Encino hospital, and it wasn\u2122t far from my -- from my studio. So what happened is is I got -- and it was Monday morning, I got terrible cramps, and I called a friend if she could take me. And she to ok me in, and the doctor said take her in right away, because I had -- delivering another baby. And she was sitting in the front room, and doing a -- she told -- I found out later doing a check, balancing your checkbook. That was all still Americans, not -- no survivors. I didn\u2122t know any survivors.

But it was a beautiful Bar Mitzvah. And, in fact, David was mostly an atheist. But now, as he is getting older, is very, very Jewish inclined.

And I said, \ufb01Why, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 56why the nice people die first?\ufb02 And he said to me, \ufb01Because God doesn\u2122t want them to suffer.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01That is no excuse.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I have never done anything, my two little sisters have never done anything in their lif e.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Why did -- one was three years old, she didn\u2122t even have a chance to -- to suffer, or not to suffer.

But, when the aliyah start coming in from Russia, we had a big convention, B\u2122nai Br ith convention, and I was there, and it was in the aisles microphones, and I came up, and I said, \ufb01Rabbi, you want us to make Jews out of the Russian people.

I knew survivors, but I didn\u2122t really associate with them, because they were from Poland. I had nothing did -- I had -- we had nothing in common. So I met a lot of Lithuanian survivors. And this is -- I mean, my life was always the museum, and always the Holocaust. The first time I start talking was here in the valley. It was one time a very big tycoon, the Glickmans.

And they called me over, they said, \ufb01Would you talk to havara group, tell them your story?\ufb02 That was the first time I start talking about the Holocaust, it was about 32 years ago. When he brought me home, that professor, from -- from Grant High School, he said to Cornelius, \ufb01I created another billi -- Billy Graham.\ufb02 From that day on, I start talking about the Holocaust to everyone that will listen, and never stopped. And what happened is is -- but never, never did I tell anybody anything that they didn\u2122t want to hear. The only thing that is before I went to go to be citizen in -- and one of my clientele was a daughter-in-law of Professor J.C. Owens, he was the right hand of Hoover. And she said to me, \ufb01If you are going to be, be a Republican, not a Democrat.\ufb02 And Cornelius, and his mother, and everybody, big De mocrats.

In fr ont of all my clientele, you are telling me that.\ufb02 She took it out of the safe, and she br ought it to me, and I read the story, when Hoover was in 1938 in Europe, and he came back, and he asked Roosevelt to do something about the Jews that are being killed in Europe. He didn\u2122t come himself to Palo Alto, he sent somebody, and to ld them to inform Mr. Hoover that he cannot be bothered with a handle -- handful of Jews.

            "answer": "It hurts me very much, this subject. Because the museum has to stay, because I put -- this was the first museum built in the United States of America. We had breakfast with Elie Wiesel. I still have the picture of me and Elie Wiesel, and Freddie Diamond. And Elie Wiesel at that breakfast, was a very small breakfast from the federation, said that this was a jewel. We were on the 12 th floor of the Jewish Federation building. And then we start -- they start building the Washington museum, and Lydia Bodka is the president of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 66the Council of Post-War Jews organization. And every year in February -- now I can\u2122t, because I work, we went, and when I had the money, and we helped Latka and Benjamin Meet send people all through the concentrati on camps, and Yad Vashem -- teachers, to be able to teach the Holocaust. When I started to -- not lecture, I don\u2122t call it a lecture -- talk about my experiences in the Holocaust -- I\u2122m not a lecturer, I\u2122m not a teacher. I -- it was done here a little bit, and there a little bit, and there a little bit, and people came by the hundreds to the museum when it first opened, because for them it was new. I was 10 days, I\u2122ll show you, from the president of th e University of Utah, southern Utah. I was supposed to be 48 hours, I st ayed for 10 days. I set up a Holocaust museum in the library, and the kids were coming down from the mountai ns, the Indian kids, a nd all kind of kids. And it was called Jewish week. And there was all different kind of illel, did a lot of cooking, and dancing, and so on. There was one Jewish students in the whole -- at that time it was a college, now it\u2122s a university. So -- and I paid for everything, and then there was a director from Yad Vashem working, S home Balmar, at that time, at our museum, and I called, and I saw all those big people from Israel, from the American Jewish committee, and so on. So I -- right away I send him a ticket he should come right away to Utah. And then he lectured at the washing -- at the Einstein hall. So you see, whenever I talk, and whatever I do, I always end up Ho locaust -- talking about the Holocaust, and what it should be done about the Holocaust. You know, about a couple of weeks ago, I couldn\u2122t get speakers. And the museum is sma ll now, very small, because we are sharing till the other building is finished, we are sharing the whole first floor of a building with USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 67two other agencies of the federation, with the library, and the Jewish Historical Society. So, when they have a big group, we divide it in three parts. We send them to the monument, we have a big monum ent at Palm Pacific Park, that was built by survivors, and I was on the committee too. In fact, I\u2122m engraved in the committee. And we have the museum, so what we do is we divide it in three groups. And I couldn\u2122t get any speakers that day, so I spoke to three different groups at the same time, the same day. And worked."

Stutthof is the only camp that the original gas chamber -- the original crematorium is still standing. But this is the forgotten death camp.

            "answer": "The something that bothers me is that a lot of them are adding certain things that other people went through, that they discussed with. And that what bothers me when I was interviewing, because I read a lot about the Holocaust, even for the Polish people, and Auschwitz, and -- and Majdanek, and everythi ng else. I worked with, \ufb01The Triumphant Spirit,\ufb02 with Nick Decalsio on the book. And it bothers me when people -- like take the Hungarians, from Budapest I\u2122m talking about. They didn\u2122t -- they -- they only start suffering in 1944, and they were put in the ghetto in 1944. But they also suffered, and a lot of them were killed in Auschwitz, and everything. But I don\u2122t think they went through the things that the people that went through -- that went through from 1939. Like, I couldn\u2122t say I went through like the Polish people that started 19 -- 9 -- \u212239, or the German Jews. But the German Jews, in the beginning, before the Kristallnacht still lived pretty good. You understand what I mean? And like again with the Anne Frank\u2122s diary. You take the Anne Frank\u2122s diary, there\u2122s hundr eds of people that wrote diaries, but Anne Frank\u2122s diary was found first. And I want to tell you a story about Anne Frank\u2122s diary. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 69My cousin, Leah Salisbury that converted to baptism -- I don\u2122t know what she converted, she married a guy -- she\u2122s my mother\u2122s cousin, she wasn\u2122t my cousin, she was the literary agent to Anne Frank\u2122s diary in -- in America. I never had a lot to do with her, because her mother was Jewish, and she didn\u2122t do it very much, she only had to do -- she only had to do with show people And she wanted me to come to her estate in -- in Sanvits shwanza, somewhere in New York, Connecticut, whatever it is -- I don\u2122t know what it -- what it is. I never went, because I didn\u2122t like it the way she treat her mother. It was her mother 80th birthday, I was a youngster at that time, it was my mother\u2122s aunt. And I went there -- Aunt Molly, and her biggest pl easure was modeling, at 80 years old for the temple, and things like that. And no, Leah went, was stayed up 10 - 15 minutes, and she left. So when she send me tickets when Anne Frank\u2122s diary was here, as a theater in Los Angeles, I didn\u2122t go. And I don\u2122t really believe in Anne Frank\u2122s diary. I believe that it happened, of course, it did happen. But there is so many diaries been written, there\u2122s so many children been hidden, there\u2122s so many children been killed, like my two little sisters, one three years old, that was born in ghetto, that doesn\u2122t even know what it means that little piece of bread, one piece of fi -- a whole piece of bread, or a whole piece of -- of milk, or anything. But she knew every German. They were so smart, like God has give them more head, or something. Every German that wa lked by, she knew by name, when she was hidden. You know, because when they took away all the children, my biggest crime my mother committed is by hiding of my two little sisters. And that why she was killed at 34 years old, in Stutthof. I don\u2122t know, like I told you, where she was killed. Now that I read USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 70a lot more about -- when I start reading more about Theresienstadt, and Auschwitz, and everything that was going on, I don\u2122t know where she was killed."

Mr. Chappel, here in los -- I can only talk about the people in Los Angeles that I know.

You must have heard of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 71him. He comes from Kovno. He was in Kovno ghetto part time.

And my -- my uncle died first, then I -- they were well-to-do people, they have a -- they had a electric factory, and so on. My cousin Leah\u2122s husband had a garage. So there was no problems of any kind, and they were very happy to come here, and I was very happy to go to Israel. And most of it was the gathering of the survivors in Israel that Benjamin Meet arranged. I went to Yad Vashem, and one year -- see, my mother-in-law died . She was brought out of the Hungarian club into Israel, and they gave a big, big deal for her, but she didn\u2122t have time. She was honored here in \u212268 with some trees in Israel. W-We put in Putnam. I have a big citation for her. Like I said, I don\u2122t take citation all over the place. And then I went -- then I went in \u212285, and I insisted -- because they knew me in Yad Vashem arad, and ev -- a-and sh-show me -- everybody knows me -- knew me, and so I say -- I insisted that I want the tree already planted. So they went through the books, and they found it, and the tree was planted with two other people from Holland, at the same time. And it looks down on the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 79fallen soldiers, from the mountain. I haven\u2122t se en it since, I\u2122m sorry to tell you that.
