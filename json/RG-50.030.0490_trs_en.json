So, through a man I met on a train -- and my instinct always told me he\u2122s okay, or she\u2122s okay, or not, I found entry into a very interesting group of resisters in Dahlem who specialized in forging papers, forging money, and the whole thing. And ha -- hiding people, or sending then into hiding, 74 German army deserters, Jews, whoever came to th eir door, they were taken care of. And that all took place in the gardener\u2122s house, adjacent to Le ni Riefenstahl\u2122s beautiful villa, which reminded one of Hitler\u2122s Berkoff. It was probably built with B-Berkoff in mind. I never saw the lady, she was out filming on th -- all through the war. But she had just been married to a German officer by the name of Jarkop, he was a major. And he popped up once in awhile, so we had to be very, very careful. And I remember going there once, there was the so-called caretaker, with his socalled wife. They weren\u2122t married, you know, but they gained, somehow, Leni Riefenstahl\u2122s trust, and were taking care -- you know, with all the bombing, care of the house and garden, and very fast through this -- this man, Hans Andres was his name, and he was a funny existence. He was very much anti-Nazi, and -- but he was d ealing on the black market, I think, and black market meant money, money, money. And money was always needed. And in the cellar of that house there were machine -- first of all there was an arsenal of weapons. And then there was a money forging machine, and a money printing m achine and -- and paper forging machine, and all that, and they -- they took me into that, you kn ow, into their trust, they knew they could, and the s -- as soon as somebody had come, and ther e were -- usually they were received in the kitchen, and got something to eat and to dri nk. And with the slightest noise that was not expected, there was an opening in the floor through which you could go down in the cellar. They were quickly pushed down, and the carpet o-over them. And one day I was there, the caretaker, Powell and I were there. Powell was wearing an apron, green gardener\u2122s apron when there was a knock at the door. God, what is it now? There were two deserters in the kitchen. Down with the deserters. It was Leni Riefenstahl\u2122s dear husband. And Powell said to me, \ufb01Keep him out of the kitchen.\ufb02 And he pushed me -- bu -- bu -- bu -- made me drag him into the bedroom, you know. I was red -- not ready, but prepared for anything. And -- and he would -- and Powell said, \ufb01You 75 know, we\u2122ve just wiped the floor of the kitchen, ju st will -- if you give us a minute.\ufb02 So I went into the little bedroom with him. An extrem ely stupid looking man by the way, and -- and then he just wanted to see if everything was in order. Oh yes, of course, Herr Major, of course Herr Major. At that time I didn\u2122t know yet who he was. There hadn\u2122t been time, you know, was just somebody. And then he came into the kitchen, looked around, everything seemed fine, everything had been pushed into drawers, and -- and bottles into the closets and all that. And then he said -- and the car was -- staff car was wa iting for him, and he said now he -- he had to go back to the front. The front was probably 10 miles away, or 20 miles away.

So I -- I kind of ran home, and there w-was my mother, very thin, very much alone. I mean, she had a house full of refugees, of course, and in good spirits as I -- you know, of -- always collected, calm and coll ected. And then -- yeah. Then I\u2122d stay -- I stayed until -- until the first us -- beginning of April, 40 -- \u212246, Apr il \u212246. I decided to go back to Hasseldorf, see how my horse is, and ra -- I worked for the Norddeutscher radio station as an announcer and I wanted to go back to my job, and how was it -- yeah, there was no way to get 108 back, either. And so I smuggled myself into a refugee camp, even got food rations there, I remember. And somehow th -- th ere was a train, like cattle cars, like the ones, you know, that were used to ship the Jews away. Cattle cars, maybe twen -- 10 - 20 cattle cars. And right smack in the middle was one car reserved for the British -- a re-regular car -- a car reserved for the British who would accompany the train and tried to -- would try to protect us against the Russian soldiers. And at the -- at the checkpoint, I conversed with one. He said, \ufb01You speak English, you\u2122ll be our interpreter.\ufb02 And so I was very glad. I was allowed to travel in the -- i -- I put my things in the -- in a -- in a -- in the cattle ca -- in the cattle car, and in th e next one that was the British car, oh, I got a beautiful meal and beer, and whatever. And whatever my services were -- were demanded, I did it. I did it, and you know , g-going a stretch that nowadays by car would take from Berlin two and a half hours, then t ook 24. 20 f -- more, or more. I v -- know we left in the afternoon at three and were there the next morning at seven. So, 12 - 13 - 14 - 15 - 16. And they s -- the sergeant, Atkinson was his name, Se rgeant Atkinson told me that before the border dividing the Russian zone from the British zone , I should get out of the British car because the Russian soldiers would come and inspect the Brit ish car and they did not like German citizens mingling with the British, meaning a -- I would go into the -- into the car in front of us and pretend to be one of the -- well, I was one of the people. And then he would give me a sign with his -- with his flashlight that I would come back. And so, go th ere and the -- the Russian guards come in and they read the -- they -- they read the documents upside down, you know, most of them couldn\u2122t read it, other than Cyrillic, if they could at all. And everyth -- they went out and the train begins to go into motion again. And I look, standing by the open door, that were not sealed, fortunately, I see a signal fr om the other car. Aha, this is my signal and so I j -- clad with thick under, you know, pullovers, and a sheep coat, I jump down and I find no bottom and I fall 109 and fall in spirals, and finally the water of th e river closes over me, in freezing temperatures. There were no -- you know, the -- the -- the -- the -- the tracks were all damaged, and what Sergeant atkin -- Atkinson had -- had tried to do was warn me of that, but I had, you know, the original message had been -- and I was the -- it was the very, very shallow river, but I came up again like a cork, and saw the -- the train was halted, it was standing, and I saw the -- all the British soldiers coming to rescue me. And they -- th ey -- they had to wade into the water and pull me out. And I had a gigantic -- it\u2122s still to s ee here, the bump on my forehead. I had bump --"
