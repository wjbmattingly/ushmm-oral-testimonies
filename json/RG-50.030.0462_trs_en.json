But otherwise, I have -- I had very little interest in the whole business, because we have learned of the gassing pretty la te, yeah. And -- then later, while in Birkenau, and while I had been engaged, and I received an drawing office in the camp office, and I was engaged to pr -- to produce some diagrams with all the movements in the camp -- in the women\u2122s camp. He said I had to produce those diagrams who were then sent over to Berlin. It was only then that I became more interest in the gassing process, because I had to register the daily gassing of women in the camp. And that, I re -- I had reported every -- every end of the month I received some daily reports of those gassings, and had to enter that on the diagram. So that\u2122s why I knew about it, and why sometimes we ha d to -- the people who were already pre -- prepared us, or -- not prepared, but people who were decided o-of their killing, through gas, were still alive while I already had to enter them on my diagram as -- as dead people, yeah. That wasn\u2122t -- that wasn\u2122t bad, the hardest part of it was between the selectio ns in -- in -- in those selections, yeah, not of newcomers, but those wh o were living in the camp. The selections, the transfer to the gas chamber, it took sometimes on whole, mayb e 12 hours, but in advance, we already had to register them as dead, because they were not alive any more, was in the transtransfer process.

So, people who knew the language, the German women, spoke German. Our women, from Slovakia in the be ginning, spoke enough German to communicate. They were -- but we were mainly looking for th e companionship of poli tical prisoners, because those who were professional prostitutes, were not very attractive to us, they were different, was an different -- different category of people. And the political prisoners had their own companionship with -- since Ravensbr\u00fcck, w ho -- there were couples who were already established couples.

Because she knew from experience, what to do under the camp conditions. Having her husband to probably practice medicine there an di fferent way, but I had an woman what -- during my malaria attacks, who was an Jehovah Witness, who brought -- and worked in the SS pharmacy.

There were even runners, I can show you very nice pictures of Indian tribes in the old times, and Indian tribes today, South American Indian tribes, where people live in the high plateau of the Andean mountains, where they have no other communication, like verbal communication between one tribe and another, by using individuals, the so-called runners, yeah? They walk from one village to another and communicate, or convey messages, and so on. So the runner business is no t an invented one of the concentration camp, but as we had no vehicles, the ter -- the distances between camp -- in the camp, between 162 barracks, were pretty large. Bicycles were not used for -- for -- inmates couldn\u2122t u -- did not have any bicycles, only the SS, some of them were able to use bicycles. The SS runners actually had bicycles. An runner is somebody who conveys messa ges, or who has an job to do, to do it fr -- [indecipherable] from one point to another, and ha -- with a certain order to do something, to bring some people from one barrack to -- to anothe r, to -- to the front entrance for any reason, or to -- is a messenger service, more or less. Now, there were no -- no other way of communication, no-not even telephones, yeah. They have used people who were messengers, yeah. So, sometimes they had dual -- an dual duty. Sometimes they were runners who were sent from one - from the main e -- from the camp office, for ex ample, to an barrack, and convey an message or ask the blockelteste to come to the camp offi ce, or some similar orders were given from headquarters, from the t-top management to us, and we had to execute that through the runners, yeah. Through those people who are sending them through different barracks, or different facilities to -- to convey an certain order, or message, or whatever. And they work mainly in couples. When the one couldn\u2122t do it, then the ot her took over, yeah, or when one was on lunch break, or in the toilet, and something has to be done in a hurry, the other took over. They were couples molis. But then you had an other function of certain runners, who made an -- had an dudual function. They were multi-lingual, and could be used as translators. So, such, for example, was Mala, was an runner, and an translator betw een German and French, and German and I think Polish, she could speak Polish."

That was one of the ac tivities, too, to accomp any certain people who have to appear at the SS headquarters in the shtopskaboida for interrogation. That was ma -- one of the main activities of the shtopskaboida of personnel, SS with their secretaries. Now, there was Mala, there was Ava Pomeranz, and so on. So, there are some still alive, and I know where they are, and I even made myse lf a list of all the runners. So, it was an important activity, because without telephone, and without vehicles, and with such an big enterprise was -- there was so many movements going -- so many things going on, that they had that -- that it was a messenger service among others, yeah."
