He said I had to produce those diagrams who were then sent over to Berlin. It was only then that I became more interest in the gassing process, because I had to register the daily gassing of women in the camp. And that, I re -- I had reported every -- every end of the month I received some daily reports of those gassings, and had to enter that on the diagram. So that\u2019s why I knew about it, and why sometimes we had to -- the people who were already pre -- prepared us, or -- not prepared, but people who were decided o-of their killing, through gas, were still alive while I already had to enter them on my diagram as -- as dead people, yeah. That wasn\u2019t -- that wasn\u2019t bad, the hardest part of it was between the selections in -- in -- in those selections, yeah, not of newcomers, but those who were living in the camp. The selections, the transfer to the gas chamber, it took sometimes on whole, maybe 12 hours, but in advance, we already had to register them as dead, because they were not alive any more, was in the trans- transfer process.

In those days, we needed communication. You had to learn how to survive, you had to learn many things, and that couldn\u2019t be done without an verbal communication. So, people who knew the language, the German women, spoke German. Our women, from Slovakia in the beginning, spoke enough German to communicate. They were -- but we were mainly looking for the companionship of political prisoners, because those who were professional prostitutes, were not very attractive to us, they were different, was an different -- different category of people. And the political prisoners had their own companionship with -- since Ravensbrick, who -- there were couples who were already established couples. And those who had no partner were not even seeking for any partner, because they had their husbands at home, or in -- during the war, somewhere on the front, or they were old, and were never married, and had no -- didn\u2019t know what it means to have a partner at all, yeah, spinsters, who were -- but they were decent people who were idealists, because that was the reason why they were put into the camp as Socialists or Communists. So, I myself always looked for good people. I had an good friend who was the wife of an -- she was German, 4 but had an Jewish husband, and two sons at home. And she practiced, more or less, medicine. We had such different ailments, like in civilian life, all of a sudden, everybody -- most of the women -- at least I, among others, we were lot an -- pus in my whole mouth, yeah. Between the teeth, the tongue, everything. I couldn\u2019t talk, I couldn\u2019t swallow, I couldn\u2019t do nothing. It was an awful situation. I don\u2019t know where from, how she got it, she was coming every day with something. And I had to keep that in my mouth for awhile, and then spit it out, and she cured me, yeah. Because she knew from experience, what to do under the camp conditions. Having her husband to probably practice medicine there an different way, but I had an woman what -- during my malaria attacks, who was an Jehovah Witness, who brought -- and worked in the SS pharmacy. They were stealing every day, one tablet of shineen, yeah."

There were even runners, I can show you very nice pictures of Indian tribes in the old times, and Indian tribes today, South American Indian tribes, where people live in the high plateau of the Andean mountains, where they have no other communication, like verbal communication between one tribe and another, by using individuals, the so-called runners, yeah? They walk from one village to another and communicate, or convey messages, and so on. So the runner business is not an invented one of the concentration camp, but as we had no vehicles, the ter -- the distances between camp -- in the camp, between 2 barracks, were pretty large. Bicycles were not used for -- for -- inmates couldn\u2019t u -- did not have any bicycles, only the SS, some of them were able to use bicycles. The SS runners actually had bicycles. An runner is somebody who conveys messages, or who has an job to do, to do it fr -- [indecipherable] from one point to another, and ha -- with a certain order to do something, to bring some people from one barrack to -- to another, to -- to the front entrance for any reason, or to -- 1S a Messenger service, more or less. Now, there were no -- no other way of communication, no-not even telephones, yeah. They have used people who were messengers, yeah. So, sometimes they had dual -- an dual duty. Sometimes they were runners who were sent from one - from the main e -- from the camp office, for example, to an barrack, and convey an message or ask the blockelteste to come to the camp office, or some similar orders were given from headquarters, from the t-top management to us, and we had to execute that through the runners, yeah. Through those people who are sending them through different barracks, or different facilities to -- to convey an certain order, or message, or whatever. And they work mainly in couples. When the one couldn\u2019t do it, then the other took over, yeah, or when one was on lunch break, or in the toilet, and something has to be done in a hurry, the other took over. They were couples molis. But then you had an other function of certain runners, who made an -- had an du- dual function. They were multi-lingual, and could be used as translators. So, such, for example, was Mala, was an runner, and an translator between German and French, and German and I think Polish, she could speak Polish."

And that what happened with that particular transport when she arrived, where she was in the Belgian transport. I was sitting there, and watching, and all of a sudden, somebody went up on a table like that, and giving orders to the crabat -- to the whole group. She didn\u2019t know, is she crazy? I went over to her, and I said, \u201c\u201cWhat are you doing here? Get down from the table.\u201d She didn\u2019t understood. I said, \u201cGet down. Look, you are now in Auschwitz. You are not in Belgium, I don\u2019t want you to show off. The moment you show off, you\u2019 ve -- the SS will remember you. Get down off here -- from here. Get off the table.\u201d So, a-after awhile she went down. And then the next days -- she took over leadership, yeah? Next days, she was presented by the blockelteste as somebody who speaks languages. In the arbatz einsatz, yeah. Was in our building, in our office, in our [indecipherable] my drawing office, so she was sent -- given the job as an runner.

So in any case, that went on, on and on. She did her job, and she was coming every day, and when she needed some favors to help the girls from Belgium, she had an easy -- easy approach to us, because we helped her. Now -- then, all of a sudden, the day when she escaped, you know that she had malaria, and she used to have attacks from time to time, and we knew that. The day when she escaped, same day I we -- she was living on number six barrack, in the barrack where the people from the -- the klidonskcamera, they are living. And I went at lunchtime, over to six.

Then I finally noticed the barrack was totally empty, but -- because they were working in the beglidinskammer the whole barrack, but there was Mala in her bed, and next to her, her boyfriend Edek, standing next to her.
