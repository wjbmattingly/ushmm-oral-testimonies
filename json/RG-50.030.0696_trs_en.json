He lift up this knife and said to God, \"Now you have him.\" God stopped him and said, \"No, I don't want him to be k illed.\" He didn't say, \"Don't touch your son,\" but \"Don't touch this boy.\" Why? Because as a son you gave him to me, so he's my son and to you he's just a boy. Do you understand? So what did God do? He gave him -- he gave him a animal, a kosher animal. There -- this animal couldn't walk any farther because _ stopped it. And he took Avram and k illed the animal. He gave it to God instead Yitzc hok, and Yitzchok was already God's son.

And we have foremothers, and they did have thei r children and this way God did create our nation. Now, if you'll ask me why did God need us? You know how? Because did you ever hear of Noah ?

He gave us a part of Israel. And that's what I believe. I see th at everything what they did right went through. And do you know what? When I had my business -- maybe I shouldn't tell you that -- one girl, an Italian girl, older girl, said, \"Jesus is God.\" I telled her, \"How can this be?\" \"He is God. He is God.\" I said, \"What happened to the God which was until him?\" So he had probably to go to the unemployment! He lost his job. {Laughter}"
