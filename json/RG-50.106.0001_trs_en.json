You smiled and consoled so fast from your small grief. Oh put out love tied around your colorful rich world.

Tana can't play with you anymore.\" And the little girl didn't know why, but she left with this sort of look. And my mother and grandmother just looked at each other. My mother told me to go get my coat. I remember I grabbed my teddy bear. And my mother, my grandmother hugged each other, and we just left and we were put on a truck. But I had no idea where we were going, what was going on at that time. It was just that I was being taken away from my playmate.

It was actually a place -- a holding place -- until we were put on a train. We were there for about four days or five days. I just remember being very very scared, because it was the first time I was really separated from my mother, and I was with all these children and I didn't know anybody. And I was determined I was going to find her. And the next thing I really remember 1s being in Theresienstadt. My first recollections were walking with my mother and it was a park and it had old swings and all of a sudden my mother screamed. It was a lady walking with a blind man pushing a baby carriage. And my mother had met one of her earlier very best friends of all places that she had really lost contact with. The gentleman was a first world war veteran also lost his eyesight in that war. And so, he was sort of a national hero. That's why he went to Theresienstadt, not to Auschwitz or anywhere else. And my mother was overjoyed meeting these people. The little boy had been born there of all places. And I remember the camp -- the barracks."

I remember that a lot of people, they didn't speak German, especially in the hospital -- the kids. There were not that many Germans there. And I was totally lost language-wise. We -- when I wasn't sick, while my mother was doing various jobs there, we were allowed to attend a day camp, which was run by, you know, inmates, girls. And there we were allowed to paint and draw pictures. We worked with little tiles. You know, a few little toys for us. But even there they made -- the Nazis made sure that we would be impressed and would remember our experiences as small as we were. When the people were brought in -- mainly the men were brought in from the outside, they were half starved -- and this was Czechoslovakia. And this was December, this was winter, it snows like Russian snows -- they would be taken off the carts. And these were skeleton of people. And they were going by outside the windows.

            "answer": "My mother, as I said before, was born of a -- born Protestant mother and a Jewish father. My grandmother converted when she married my grandfather. I think they were treading very easy at that time. They didn't want to antagonize the Christians by having too many Christians killed. So my grandmother would say because of her age and she wasn't important as an old woman, 70-year-old woman, she wasn't going to do that much harm. My mother, they weren't quite sure yet where she fit in. She was not born of a Jewish mother, which makes a difference. Like I said before, they measured her -- the nose, the head and neck. And they really -- it took them a while to say, \"Well, we're going to put you in a holding camp until we can figure out what we're going to do with these mischling -- people who were of half breeds or not quite totally Jewish.\" There were a lot of -- in Theresienstadt -- war heros, like Simon, whom they didn't want to kill off either. We don't want a big war hero from World War I, who got the congressional medal of whatever in Germany and we wanted no -- a lot of writers out there, musicians."

They didn't want to leave them free, but they didn't want to send them to the death camps right away. And also people like my mother that they couldn't decide quite how Jewish she was at that time. I was lucky, because I was totally Jewish because -- well, almost totally Jewish, because I have a Jewish father."
