You smiled and consoled so fast from your small grief. Oh put out love tied around your colorful rich world. Thank you for all you have already given us -- memories of innocence, purity, and a life gone by. Life for ourselves has already vanished so long ago."

Her brother survived. He was in Germany. He went into a mental institution and declared himself insane to hide. And he spent three and a half years in a mental institution. And the only one on to him was his nurse -- not a Jewish woman. And she kept his secret. Unfortunately, after three and a half years of living in a mental institution, his problems were just unbelievable. He did come out. He did marry her. She stopped by him."

They didn't want -- they knew, I guess, that it was all coming to an end in '45. And they didn't want any visible signs of this camp. Theresienstadt was a fortress at one time. Just outside of Prague, a small town in the countryside of Prague, and was used as an army fortress. And they were just going to get rid of it all totally so there was no signs of it. So when this war 1s over and whoever -- Americans -- whoever came over, there would be nothing left to say, \"Yes, there was something there at one time.\" And they had to do this kind of quickly where it was this was going to be over pretty soon. And so, they had to act very quickly. And somehow the Red Cross got wind of this, and the Russians came in."

So my grandmother would say because of her age and she wasn't important as an old woman, 70-year-old woman, she wasn't going to do that much harm. My mother, they weren't quite sure yet where she fit in. She was not born of a Jewish mother, which makes a difference. Like I said before, they measured her -- the nose, the head and neck. And they really -- it took them a while to say, \"Well, we're going to put you in a holding camp until we can figure out what we're going to do with these mischling -- people who were of half breeds or not quite totally Jewish.\" There were a lot of -- in Theresienstadt -- war heros, like Simon, whom they didn't want to kill off either. We don't want a big war hero from World War I, who got the congressional medal of whatever in Germany and we wanted no -- a lot of writers out there, musicians."
