I was born May 25\", 1925 in New York City. I\nwas going to City College, Brooklyn College actually, in New York City when I\nenlisted in the army. Took the ASTP test, was accepted into engineering school in\nthe army, but I had to perform 13 weeks of basic training and then I was sent to Cal\nTech for engineering school. After the first term was over, which was December, I\nguess of \u201944, the Battle of the Bulge occurred. We were closed down and we were\nsent to Europe as replacements. I was in this 13\" armored division, 16 infantry\nbattalion, assigned to half-tracks and tanks. And after three major campaigns, the\nwar was winding down. And May 1945 we entered the place called Dachau, right\noutside of Munich. We were never told about Dachau, we were never told about\nconcentration camps. We had no idea that we were getting into something like that.\n",

I was a kid, I really was a naive kid and when I saw the bodies lying around, it \u2014 it really got to me.

And they had tags attached to their toes. We were there \u2014 as it was getting dark that evening, we were wandering around. We were warned, do not feed the prisoners, but we were hungry ourselves and we had K rations and C rations, which were almost indigestible to the soldiers. And these people were starving and we gave them frankfurters and beans and we almost killed them. We really did, their stomach couldn\u2019t take it. Then a young lady came up to me, who I thought was in her 30\u2019s. It turned out she was 19, and through an interpreter \u2014 she kept pointing to a mezuzah that I was wearing around my neck, a little silver cylinder given to me by my grandmother ...
