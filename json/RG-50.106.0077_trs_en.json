And it didn\u2019t last very long because as you know in 1933 the Nazis came into power.

I went to school one day as I always did and was called out of class.

So they dug into the back, my background as far back as a child of six, seven years old could remember. And when I came home and told my parents about this, they were furious. And it wasn\u2019t too long after that that my parents put me into a private school for Jewish girls.

Because he felt at that time that 1t was a heck of a lot of nerve for these people to take, get hold of a young person like myself and dig into their background. I have to tell you that at the time, at the time, I wasn\u2019t aware. I was curious why. And I also knew that not everybody had this. And you know kids are very tuned into other kids and other kids knew that I went for this interview, but not everybody did. So already there was a line drawn.

I have, I remember her. The boy and I was a bit of a tomboy, this particular boy and his friends, but I\u2019m focusing on him because he was, lived in the building. He joined very early on as a very young kid the Hitler Youth and from that moment on I became an outcast. For several years he tormented us with bad language, throwing stones, kicking us and as he got older, of course it got worse. He somehow disappeared. I don\u2019t know if they moved or what happened. I, I really don\u2019t know. The, this girl friend of mine from very early on, they didn\u2019t live that close to us but her parents and my parents were also friends.

            "answer": "As I said you didn\u2019t have to know the people, the youngsters. Mainly young people. My age, older. You walked around with a nervous stomach and you saw kids that were not, that you knew were not Jewish kids. Because we were teased. We were made fun of. We were called bad names. They had nobody to answer to. In other words, this was the accepted thing. You felt fortunate if they left you alone. And I\u2019m not going to tell you that they, many times when I say they, I\u2019m talking different kids, different from different areas. Don\u2019t\u2019 forget I had to use public transportation to go to school, once I started private school. So you felt fortunate if you didn\u2019t get picked on and made fun of and tugged at and pulled at and kicked. And I will say this, I fought back too. Yes I did. And but that didn\u2019t matter. I was very young."

Also I have to tell you, some of this other than kids in the immediate circle of friends, some of this was a little more gradual. Little more gradual. So that it not everybody pounced it, on you at the same time. And there were rest periods. But then of course in the last two years there, it became intolerable."

            "answer": "No because it was, things were very isolated visits as far as visiting family is concerned, going to the country. I have to say that I did not. They may have been. I heard conversations you know that they set, you know my grandparents used to say you know this person was you know not friendly toward Jews. But especially my grandfather. He was in a situation where he was a professional man. People came to him to get rid of a tooth, get rid of pain, to get a filling, to get a tooth pulled. They were more than grateful if you took care of them. And he was also somewhat educated in medicine. So they came to him actually for more than just the dental work. And I would say that 60% of his patients were not Jewish. But very grateful that he took care of them, because I used to sit there and watch him work."

And this is, it was subtle. Mainly I heard it through my father who was a very much into the politics of the day and the conversations, et cetera. But other than experiencing the anti, what we now call, what was then called to the anti- Semitism or the anti-Jewish situation.

It didn\u2019t start to affect his livelihood until it ceased. It did totally cease. For the last year I would say not more that he was in business. And he also represented a company.

I have no idea where they got them from. And they built like a fire. These were the uniformed brown shirt Nazis, a lot of them young. The youth groups, the youth groups. Hitler Youth. Which you have heard a lot about. And they would light them up and set them on fire and go nuts. And, and absolutely think they were listening to a rock concert.

I might also add that I would say that even prior to Hitler, maybe just prior, just after he came in. There were the makings, not even the makings, it was a natural but for a certain element of people to persecute or be anti-Semitic, as it is everywhere. Desecration of a synagogue, desecration of a store front, name calling. You know I, I want to say that also was part of normal life. It didn\u2019t necessarily all begin with this maniac. But of course it intensified. We have listen we have some of that in any country. And I might add in Poland too. But you know you don\u2019t dwell on it. It happens.

I didn\u2019t know too much about Mein Kampf then, his book but that\u2019s what I remember seeing because they were up and around and especially when I still went to public school.

But we, I have to be honest. The media and the information that trickled back is not like today. Today a person sneezes at one end of the world and it\u2019s picked up at the other end of the world. Those were not days of great communication but my father did know about a camp by the name of Dachau which has become infamous. And but you didn\u2019t really understand.

And some left, some people left as early on as 1934, 35. My father\u2019s brother who would follow him to Germany and they were in business together for a time his younger brother. He did not leave under the circumstances that my father did because he was able to return to Poland and visit. But he left in 1936 and that was supposed to be when we were offered well we\u2019ll get into that I\u2019m sure. But people started to leave. They didn\u2019t want to put up with, well they were afraid. They were afraid. Some people more afraid than others and also I might say it\u2019s a tremendous venture to pick up your family, your, your, your life and move it to wherever. It\u2019s a tremendous and especially when there are children. We knew my aunt and uncle never had children so it\u2019s not as traumatic. We had another my parents had friends Jewish Polish friends, they tried to leave but they didn\u2019t. They had no children. People with children, it was a little harder, it was a little harder to pick up. Imagine yourself having to totally leave. I mean for that time it, maybe today it isn\u2019t. People are moving about the whole world. In those days they, they left for political reasons like my father did but then he had established himself in, and was raising a family.

Well we had to sneak that so instead of carrying a book bag, I mean this is just one relatively small example, although not so small. Carry instead of a book bag, a dress bag.

The other thing also was that sometime around that time the uncle that we have here suggested that my father come by himself and leave my mother and his two daughters to come at a later time. And that was not acceptable to him. I may have my dates a little muddled with that. But instead of he basically felt when that first offer came, no I have a family. And my mother was totally against moving. How could she leave. Poland was not that far away. If she came to let\u2019s say the US she would never get to see her parents and her family again. And this will pass, this, this can\u2019t last. People were in total I\u2019m not going to say denial, but disbelief.

Totally no livelihood, number one. Number two the Gestapo started hounding us. Number three people were disappearing, people that we knew were disappearing. Kids were taken out from school, as I mentioned before, first very quietly, very nicely. And then not so nice. We lived in a very nice apartment building. You heard knocks at the door in the middle of the night. More people were taken away. A few screams, screeches. Everything you know it was horrific. We heard via my father and also via friends heard of people disappearing. Oh they were sent to on a train to no man\u2019s land which 1s out in the corridor. In fact that\u2019s the word I was looking for much earlier in the tape. And in the winter time. Because winter in Germany at that time came early on, sometimes on my birthday there was snow on the ground and I was born very late in September. But they were sent out on a train and then chased off the train into no man\u2019s land. And if they tried to come back or plead they were shot. These things came back to us. Or they froze to death or got away. And these things got back to me, to my parents and also to me. And by this time I\u2019m already a pre-teen-er. Pre-teen. And so beginning to understand. But primarily for my father it was the total no job, no money coming in. Being released from his representation. And then his own business, what he did on you know himself was also nonexistent. And it was constant harassing of the Gestapo and threats and primarily people disappearing and what they heard. And never to be heard from again. And also other people making plans to leave because Germany at the time that we\u2019re now at was in a state of frenzy to rid itself of Jews. So before my uncle Max, Max Salzberg and his wife Alice left, we already knew that we had to also make plans. That\u2019s when my father was offered the opportunity to come alone and we would be sent for later on and he said no it\u2019s all of us or none of us.

He also needed to get this didn\u2019t, none of this happens overnight. He also needed to get permission from the Germans to get out, permission to leave. Might I add that all of us with the exception of my mother who had a Polish passport were stateless. And I was, my sister, my father obviously was. SO you start putting into motion plans to leave which isn\u2019t like going to a consulate today, get a visa and off you go. It\u2019s a lot of was a lot of work and persistence. With the Germans definitely bribing them. Making so called friends with them, well let\u2019s not call it friends, but it\u2019s bribing them and he did that. He bribed, he lied. He did he put every trick out of his bag that he could so that we would not be taken away. That didn\u2019t guarantee it. Did not guarantee it so he put into motion to leave. The affidavit from the uncle finally came. The permission from the Germans finally came. But we didn\u2019t have a visa from the US to come and that\u2019s where we almost didn\u2019t make it out because the Americans didn\u2019t want to give us a visa. I hate to say that. Sitting here in this beautiful country, but they didn\u2019t. And he had booked passage already for March of 39 which was changed because of a boat was being painted. So he changed 1t December of 38. That also didn\u2019t work out. The Aquitania so then he booked it for November of 38. With no proper papers. And my mother went, my mother, my sister and I went to Poland in October of 38 which was a harrowing trip which is a story all unto itself to say goodbye to the parents, the grandparents.

My curtains are wet. I\u2019m not this, I\u2019m not that. I\u2019m not packed. I don\u2019t have the thing. He said I\u2019m sorry we have to leave. And we did. But we didn\u2019t\u2019 have the visa so on the Saturday before we left we still didn\u2019t have it. We had pleaded, we had the way he was with the Germans because he couldn\u2019t, didn\u2019t bribe anybody at the American consulate. But he pleaded with them. He went every day practically. No visa, Mr. Salzberg, it\u2019s a quota it\u2019s a this, it\u2019s a that. Finally he went, took my mother, my sister Ruth and me down to the consulate. He insisted on seeing somebody. He was told nobody could see him. He says but you are going to see me, you are going to see us. Somebody has to see us. It was very dramatic, very compelling. There is no way that I can even describe that scene at the American consulate in Hamburg. There is no way. I can tell you about it and it\u2019s ever going to make the impact that it had on me anyway and I\u2019m sure my sister and all of us, especially my father for the rest of our lives. This man finally let us in and we were told time and time again that you cannot have a visa today, the papers are not ready blah, blah, blah. We were like up on the fifth or sixth floor and my father said I'll tell you something. With what\u2019s going on we are leaving and if we are not leaving Germany we are going out that window. He starts pulling me, my mother and my sister over to the window. We were going to jump. He meant it because he knew that our time was up. We had so far been left pretty much alone. As far as we weren\u2019t\u2019 dragged away in the middle of the night like many of our neighbors, let alone friends were. People in school were. We were pretty much left alone. But our time was, was up. So this fellow who was there, Mr. Davis knew that well Mr. Salzberg meant business. And we did get the visa that day. And then the rest of it 1s all pretty dramatic too. We left. Am I getting ahead of myself here. We left a few days later. We got to Cologne. We left an apartment with furniture. Some The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

We got to Cologne but we left the housekeeper there. Her name was Frau Krug and we had a little parakeet that I entrusted to her. And all the bens and the furniture but the parakeet to me was my most important possession that I had to leave behind. We got to Poland the next morning. My father called her up. I was right there with him when he called and you could see his face drain of color. She told him, we left at, the train left at midnight. At 6 AM the following morning they came and they were furious, the Gestapo. These were the people in the black uniforms, the SS people came to take us away and when she told them that we had left they were furious. Absolutely furious. The destroyed our bedding. They destroyed our apartment, they trashed it. Bayonetted my bird, bayoneted this tiny little bird and beat her to a pulp. She was not a, see what she was doing anyway was illegal. She was, she was not a Jewish woman. I have no idea what she was. But she had nowhere to go so you know for her my father said listen. Whatever 1s here is yours. But what are you going to do with it. So she was in the apartment and they didn\u2019t\u2019 believe her. They, they beat her and destroyed everything. And that\u2019s how we know when they came. We have no other way of know. How would we know but for her. And we were very grateful to be where we were, but we were still in Germany. If this were five years later with telecommunications being what they became, I don\u2019t\u2019 know that we would have made it out. But we were in Germany and changed trains and came the next saga."

There were many people on the train, some with no luggage but many people like us. But they took my father off the train and you don\u2019t dare move. Every time we moved we had everything or my mother or anybody that Nazi out there with the bayonet pointed at you and he\u2019s ready. Any excuse, any excuse so let me see my father. He\u2019s talking and he\u2019s very animated and we had no idea. All of a sudden they say the train is going to move and it started to, move, start to move along slowly and we\u2019re hysterical. There we are. My mother and two kids and no husband. He\u2019s still talking to the Germans. Finally we saw him run and he got on the last what do they call it, the end of the train. The man was 40 years old, suffered from high blood pressure. That he didn\u2019t have a heart attack then was amazing. What did they want from him. When he finally came into the compartment and told us was they said he had too much money on him. So he said well then take it. We don\u2019t do that. They didn\u2019t\u2019 offer him an alternative. He says well why can\u2019t you take it. He says we are honest, we are honest people. We don\u2019t take money. Well he had to come up with an alternative.

Interview with Jutta Levy 31 (file 2 \u2014 RG-50.106.0077.02.03 \u2014 duration: ) Esther Finder: This is an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Today\u2019s date is September 15. This is a continuation of the September 8\" interview with Jutta Levy. This is tape 2, side A. You have been telling me about your escape from Germany. But I wanted to go back and ask about something you had said previously about the last trip to Poland. YOU said it was a harrowing trip. Can you tell me about that trip? Jutta Levy: Well as I may have mentioned we went back at the insistence of my late mother. She wanted to have her last goodbyes to her parents and sister and all the relatives. So she took my sister and of course me, back to Poland. Now to go to Poland from Hamburg Germany, you get on the train and you have to go through no man\u2019s land. That\u2019s that stretch of land at that time, that was quote unquote free. That meant passing borders. You\u2019re going through border. Every border stop is a stop and the officials come on board. Well at that time, this is late 38, the Germans of course, the Nazis come on board and searched, questioned, very body on the train. I didn\u2019t know at the time what strip search meant. I was a little past 12 years old and I found that out in a big hurry. Because of a matronly German woman took the women aside and strip searched them. I was one of them. And if anybody has ever been strip searched and especially by an angry, German official of the Nazis, strip searching a young Jewish girl, you can imagine what that was like. Not pleasant, not nice and without getting graphic very nasty and impersonal. It is one of the most unpleasant experience that I had personally and I think that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that. I think one can imagine what that was like. They made it difficult. They let us go but they made it unpleasant, difficult, and also very, very frightening. I was dreading the trip The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

They were very thorough about checking our luggage, checking us personally but this intense strip search was not repeated. But it was going out of Germany to Poland. Why they didn\u2019t do it on the way back quite in that manner I don\u2019t\u2019 know. It\u2019s was maybe a fluke or maybe the other was. I don\u2019t know. they were angry people that, I think if they had had the chance they would have thrown us off the train. Just to be never heard from again which they eventually, which they had already done and did more of. Again, we were lucky. Sometimes not knowing a lot of things, not knowing what had already been done is a blessing. "

My parents for instance had a couple. I can even remember their name, Mr. and Mrs. Max Steiner who disappeared. We learned later on I learned later on. My parents knew even before that they were rounded up. They were taken away put on a train, sent to what I keep referring to as no man\u2019s land in the dead of winter. Told to get off at a given point. Oh they weren\u2019t the only ones. There were hundreds of them. Told to get off the train. And just let go. Chased off the train, let go, in the dead of winter.

But he could not foresee nor did he the tragedy that was to come to Poland. What was happening in Germany he felt as so many people did at that time, not so much anymore with German Jews. But living in Poland was like living in another world here or another, certainly a faraway country here. He just felt that 1t might pass. But he also fully understood why we had to leave given the circumstances I\u2019ve described before. Lack of making a living, the name calling the anti- Semitism is a mild word for what was happening. The burning destruction of synagogues. He was well aware of that. So with a lot of understanding he wished us of course the best but was sad to let us go. Not just him, all the family. It was a heart wrenching experience, much more so for my mother and it was for my sister and me too.

Without fearing that they would be arrested or they would be overheard for saying something that wasn\u2019t politically correct. And what stuck in my mind to this day is that people smuggled things out. In the most ingenious way. I remember one lady had I don\u2019t\u2019 know if it was a coat or a jacket but her big buttons about the size of maybe even bigger than a half a dollar and she was so proud of herself, as well she should have been, that she was able to smuggle out diamonds that were hidden in the hollow of those buttons and I remember that and I was totally amazed. But in retrospect how she got away with that. How they didn\u2019t, I mean this was just one. People had other ways of bringing things across. But that, that was one thing that stuck in my mind. That they were so relieved that they almost started to share and I did this and I did that and they were saying, well they were basically trashing the Nazis which they hadn\u2019t been able to do all these years. Being afraid to be overheard or if somebody, if they felt they were with somebody that they could trust and they couldn\u2019t trust them. That was another thing. So you know it goes on and on. It goes on and when you live under a regime like that and people like ourselves, people like myself it takes a while to trust again and to say wow I can say this.

But we don\u2019t want to be repetitious. I don\u2019t want to be. We got to Paris where my mother had her brother there and we stayed there waiting for the Queen Mary to take us to America. While we were in Paris, an incident happened that really changed the rest of Germany forever. And that was the young Jewish fellow. He was a Americanized, Greenspan that was his name and he killed an attach\u00e9 in Paris of the German embassy. Most people are, historians are very much aware of that. This of course caused a tremendous upheaval in Germany and that is a, it culminated what they call here now Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass because of what this young Jewish fellow did out of frustration, anger and whatever other emotion you can think of and I will say this, go on record and have said it before. That was the culmination this Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass. They had been doing these things, certainly in Hamburg and other places in Germany all that year and certainly all that fall and early winter while I was still in Germany. I heard oh yes, store fronts being broken into. And I knew of book burnings. I saw some of it. And I what I think we mean by Kristallnacht which we were still in Europe then. But 1t was the culmination of and so I only want to say that after that it was a miracle, as it was a miracle with us that we got out of Germany at the time that we did.

When he and my uncle and other, we had other relatives in Paris were talking about this incident it was with (pause) regret that this had happened because it put in jeopardy so many people, which of course it did. It also was with some relief that we were out because had the, had we not left exactly when we did. And I mean almost to the minute, I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 be talking to you today. We got out just at the nick of time, six hours before the Gestapo came to my house.

He had a son, 12 years old and here I meet this handsome young fellow. He was about 15, 16 at the time. And at 12 years old the hormones already are working a little bit so of course I immediately fell in love with this young cousin. He wrote a beautiful poem in my autograph book. Remember I never go anywhere without my autograph book. He was also an artist. He even drew a beautiful little picture. A forlorn seashore because we were leaving and turns out that this cousin we heard later who I really liked so very much. His name was Guy, Guy, G-U-Y. Joined the resistance and was shot as was his father. And needless to say although I found this out several years later, it saddened me deeply. He was, they were talented lovely, lovely people. And especially the young fellow who I, who I liked so much. Actually I would say that was my first real crush. So the other thing leaving there we had to go to Cherbourg. And everything happens at night. I don\u2019t know why. Late at night we got to Cherbourg, got on a tender. Everything was black. Everything was sort of blacked out. And all of a sudden this humongous monster appears in the water. And that was the Queen Mary with a few little lights here and there. This huge to me then and of course it is huge ship out there that we had to get on. And I have to tell you I was scared to death, but we got on the ship and started our voyage across. In November, the middle of November when the seas are pretty rough. So and we along with many other people left. The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And I don\u2019t know because I think life was gray and kind of sad at that point. The thing that was pointed out to us was the Statue of Liberty and I had heard about it but vaguely. And I couldn\u2019t\u2019 tell you if I knew the significance of it but I soon learned because people were talking about it. and to see the Statue of Liberty and people talking about what it meant that we are now free and to pursue, to, to worship, to all the things that it really stands for. To have people talk about it in German because that\u2019s all I spoke at the time, that was quite a moment. Thinking back on it now. Getting off the ship was quite something else again. My father got down on his hands and knees and he kissed the concrete ground as he came off the boat. And that\u2019s a moment I won\u2019t forget. The next thing that I saw was a stevedore that just that one stevedore. I remember. He was black and I had not seen too many black people before. In fact I hadn\u2019t, I had seen one. And he was in flowing robes and sort of a diplomat in Hamburg. So and then at first not seeing my relatives, well I mean I had never met them, you know and then my father pointed out over there his brother and his two brothers actually. The one that had left before us and the one that had been here for many years. I have no other impressions. It was very overwhelming, very, very overwhelming. And if you want me to continue on in that vein. The uncle was there that had signed our affidavit. We went to his home. we spent one night there and I was separated from my parents which was almost as traumatic as that whole experience of leaving Germany.

Because as I started to tell you, I was here one day, new country, new language, new everything and my parents went off to Detroit Michigan where my father\u2019s two brothers were and I was to go with this great aunt and uncle who lived in Washington, DC, people that I didn\u2019t\u2019 know, really never heard of them, but this was my grandmother Salzberg, my paternal grandmother\u2019s sister and her husband who said that they would take me because there was not enough room for me in Detroit. So since I was the older of the two daughters, I was the one that was elected to go with them. Now coming to a new country, being here one day, at most two days and one night and then leaving my parents and my sister was t, do you use the word traumatic. It was traumatic. I came here with them on the train. They were very nice people. They didn\u2019t\u2019 understand me, I didn\u2019t understand them. They talked Yiddish but German and Yiddish people say are so much alike, but if your ear isn\u2019t used to it you don\u2019t understand. And they tried, maybe a little bit of German but it was I didn\u2019t understand and I had to go with them. And nobody\u2019s going to feel sorry for me because they had a beautiful home. they were very well heeled people. He had a chauffeur driven car in Washington. And so I don\u2019t want anybody feeling sorry for me. I just felt sorry for me. It was my heart was aching. I was alone. I felt like I had been left, like I had been abandoned. And so I was not a happy person when I first came here. And I must say even though these people were wonderful, they meant well. The Ulmans, U-L-M-A-N. They were very good to me. They were generous.

They sent me to the Americanization school. They bought me a couple of more Americanized clothes. Not much, a little bit. They had other family here from his side. He was, Mr. Ulman was not my blood relative but his wife my aunt, great aunt I might say that part. So his he had family here and they weren\u2019t too nice to me but I frankly didn\u2019t\u2019 realize that until I understood a little bit more but they sent me to the Americanization school. Downtown at 13 and New York Avenue. The building is still standing. So I was put in with, I was the only kid there. They were all adults. To say that I disliked it is putting it mildly. I hated it. And I don\u2019t think I got a whole lot out of it because I was frankly unhappy. I cried a lot. I cried myself to sleep. I don\u2019t\u2019 know. I woke up crying. I was lonesome. They tried very hard. I, I need to say that they tried hard and I guess they thought I was happy. They had a business here. He took me to the business with him. I had no chores to do. I basically had nothing to do. I would go the Americanization school which was not a good experience for me. They didn\u2019t put me into a school and I wonder, years later why not. But that\u2019s how it went. If my father called I would cry and tell him how unhappy I was and a few months later he did make a trip to Washington to see me. I did not see my mother that whole time.

Interview with Jutta Levy 45 together again and at that time he looked around Washington and he really liked it but he at that time had no knowledge of how he would arrange making a living and coming here. So he went back to Detroit. About nine months later, maybe a little more but let\u2019s say nine, nine and a half months later my father did pick up with my mother and my sister and moved to New York. My mother had some cousins there. And he felt maybe that would be better. He didn\u2019t\u2019 like Detroit, didn\u2019t like what was going on there between the brothers, et cetera. And he came to New York and once I knew that they were in I wanted to be there also. And he came and he got me. And from a beautiful home on Davenport Street in Northwest Washington I went with my, I went to a walk up apartment at 91\u2018 and Amsterdam Avenue. Right along with the bedbugs, rats and the mice. But you know what I was happy cause we were all together at this point. Then he started to, he started to look for work do work. He sold hair ribbons, stockings. If he made two dollars he would spend it to buy then made two more dollars, spent, and bought kept the profits so we could eat and have the rent. We had very little money. We did not come here with bundles of money. He my mother made hair ribbons and my sister and I helped and various other things like that. And in the meantime all the while looking for some type of work. Without getting too wordy on this. About not too many months, not too many months, he found a position representing a company that sold basically the same things that he sold in Germany. For the territory that encompassed Washington, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. So he started thinking about making the move to Washington so he could be closer to the territory that he was to represent. And that was for him a dream come true because he already liked New York. He didn\u2019t\u2019 love it, but he did love Washington. A good reason. It was a beautiful city. It was cleaner at that time. Than New York and very much like Hamburg. He always used to say it reminded him, it was that type of city. So I would say within a year\u2019s time we made a move here. And I The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

May Corbet who was a black girl who helped me. The only person in that class in New York that helped me. How I don\u2019t even remember. I guess with sign language and little by little I started to learn English. I also listened to the radio a lot. And went to the movies a lot, a lot. Because that was an escape. And it was, and I liked it. I was a movie fan in Germany and just a fan of theater and movies theater in Germany so I went to the movies a lot. In New York and of course continued it here.

WE didn\u2019t dare talk while he was listening to the news because he was anxious to know every little bit that there was of what was going on in the world.

Some things leaked out of course, not leaked out but became known but again things move very swiftly once that Hitler marched into Poland. It was a progression that went along very swiftly as history tells us today. And we all know it. Poland was not the only stop he made. He made quite a few other stops and it was a constant search for news and for us specifically. But of course my father became agitated every country that he went into. That Hitler went into, he was agitated. And he was in a constant state of agitation and frustration. And also making a living, making a living. My mother worked and at 14 I went to work.

At that time we were already in a two bedroom apartment. To begin with we were four people in a one bedroom apartment. And shortly before Pearl Harbor we moved to a two bedrooms and at 2:00 I took my bath. And I heard my father about that time yelling that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor. And I did not know where Pearl Harbor was. Obviously he did. And I quickly got out and I thought what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s going on and he explained that Pearl Harbor was in Hawaii which was at that time a US possession or protectorate. I don\u2019t know what you call it. And essentially we would be at war with the Japanese.

As much as people didn\u2019t want to go war in America or Americans to go to war, people like my dad and at this point we too felt better get in there. Have to put a stop to what\u2019s going on. So it was horrible, horrible, horrible. And things happened so quickly within a period of two, three days. First Japan, then Germany and of course we knew about the Blitzkrieg and we at this time knew I don\u2019t want to jump ahead of me."

My parents were about, and other people, but we're specifically talking about my family. We knew that many evil things had gone on there and I refer to them as evil things as opposed to say anything else. Just how bad and how our families were affected, we really didn\u2019t know. It was a nightmare that was going to come true. Then we got a telephone call from Sweden, from mother\u2019s sister. Flora Kerner at that time. And, telling us that she and my, her daughter my cousin, Rita, had survived but that everyone else in our family had perished. I remember my father being on the telephone and falling to his knees because he was so very emotionally upset, drained. And very other thing that you can name. It wasn\u2019t a long conversation but it was enough so that he got an almost full picture of filling in gaps of things that we had only heard about or read about or listened to on the radio and now his worst nightmare come true as far as our personal family was concerned."

And that\u2019s where my aunt called from. It took several days after liberation because they were very generous from what I understand about having survivors call but my aunt had not been well. She had contracted typhus, I believe it was. So it took a few days, maybe not even extra days, but it took time. and there were thousands and thousands of extra people in various camps that were trying to reach family all over the world.

However, always hopeful that perhaps they weren\u2019t as touched as so many thousands, millions were. At that point we weren\u2019t thinking in terms of millions. We didn\u2019t\u2019 know. At least I didn\u2019t know but we knew that bad things had happened over there. We could only hope that we would get some good news that families had survived, some of our family if not all had survived. Hearing that they hadn\u2019t other than my mother\u2019s sister and her daughter was in one way of course very good news. But in another it was horrific. It was my mother and my father were devastated as was I. At that point already I was on my way, I was and adult just about, an adult already and I remembered being very pained, very, very pained. To say the very least. It\u2019s an awful feeling to hear that all your family that you left behind but two people had perished. And at that time we really didn\u2019t know exactly who died in which way. We didn\u2019t know that exactly until they came here. And I\u2019m getting ahead but my aunt and my cousin came here after Sweden, not too in 1946. So about a year, a little over a year after they were liberated. My father brought them home. He, if you like I can tell you when they called him from Sweden which was maybe a week after their initial call, he immediately went and I went with him, this is now 1945. Immediately went to I believe it was the Red Cross. I remember going on a Saturday downtown with him and getting, wiring off to the Red Cross and the wire services, $50, which to us was like it would be $5000 today. Got it together and sent it to my aunt and my cousin in Sweden. And with which he then went to work to bring them here. Which he did. He had them sponsored by my aunt, the lady that I lived with here. They were moneyed people as I said. He got her to sign the affidavit. She didn\u2019t blink an eye and signed it, not with all the problems that we had. And we tried to get her over here and did of course. And but we paid for their passage, and we set up an apartment for them where we lived. And he went and, and worked very hard, along with my mother.

Well for two hours or more my cousin told me graphically as graphic as she could get exactly what camp was like, what ghetto was like, what camp was like for her because I have since heard other stories but that was my first. And I was absolutely horrified. Talk about nightmares, if I didn\u2019t\u2019 have terrible nightmares before, I sure had them after that. Here was somebody in front of me that had lived through these horrors and they were other people that had worse stories. But her story and it\u2019s been documented was not pleasant, it was horrible.

I have a feeling that that kept her from being exterminated because she could tend to patients that had from what she told us horrible diseases in the mouth because of malnutrition, et cetera. And they tried the Germans, to for the Red Cross anyway for people who came to put up an appearance that they were doing all that they could, quote unquote. Of course that was all nonsense.

You had just told me about your talk with your cousin when she told you of her experiences in the Holocaust and I wanted to ask you how was the news of the death camps presented in this country, in the American media? Jutta Levy: Well in those days we had newsreels. And which most everyone at this point has seen. That\u2019s all we had at the time, well that\u2019s all you have. How was it presented. It was presented graphically and with certain amount of disbelief. I think the disbelief is to this day. The disbelief. Not that people didn\u2019t believe it. But my god in heaven, how could this have happened. Virtually under our noses. How could such a thing have happened? Never did my family or I ever, ever become used to seeing those pictures or those images. They were shown here not just by the news media, in the news and in the movies. Didn\u2019t have television, just yet. But 1t was not easy to take. It really was very difficult but the main thing was how was it that this government, you\u2019re talking about the American government, how is it that this could have happened. How was it that they didn\u2019t know. And if they did know why didn\u2019t they do more to help? Why didn\u2019t\u2019 they put a stop to it? As though that was so easy. But these are questions that bubbled up. There was a certain amount of anger amongst people like, like us. How could this have happened. Ok we didn\u2019t know about it. Or we didn\u2019t\u2019 have as much of a clue as maybe the governments didn\u2019t. What did they do? Why was it allowed to happen? There was anger.

Problems yes. Always struggling a bit. A lot, a bit. Looking back on everything and I hope there\u2019s more to come it\u2019s been ok. it\u2019s been fine. \u2019ma Yankee Doodle American.

The city of Hamburg has invited people like myself back and two years ago my husband and I went as guests, everything paid for. What was that like? The day I got there I knew how to get back to my apartment. And we took the subway whatever. I knew exactly where to get off. It\u2019s amazing how everything came back. I saw the apartment, I saw ultimately the school where I went. Not the public school, the private school. I went into the building, into the apartment. I went into the back yard where I had to be so quiet. During our recess. Went to the downtown branch of the school, saw what was left of my synagogue.

Interview with Jutta Levy 63 unusual that that facade is standing. The only thing that remains of it is the front of it because it was granite and it had been relatively newly built. They couldn\u2019t burn granite. The Hebrew lettering is there and I have pictures of that. What was my you asked me what was my impression going back. The area that I lived in was not bombed or harmed so basically 1t was somewhat frozen in time. The downtown area has was completely bombed and rebuilt. It\u2019s a very rich city moneywise. Pros, prosperous is a better word. I did get to see some special places that we used to go to. I also had the opportunity to go to the concentration camp Bergen Belsen where to me that\u2019s like a cemetery because people that I knew and loved I think perished there. I\u2019m not even sure but certainly my cousin and her mother had survived it. it\u2019s been sanitized. It\u2019s become like a memorial and I will say that the Germans do visit there because they have very few Jews in Hamburg. Very few. Bergen Belsen is about two hours outside of Hamburg which I didn\u2019t even know. Between Hamburg and Hanover. I didn\u2019t know that. Til I got there. I\u2019ve forgotten that you asked me. The overall impression. I was sad. When I left the plane took off and I looked down at the city where I was born and I was sad and I cried, the only time I cried. Oh I shouldn\u2019t\u2019 say that. I did cry in the back yard of the school because it hadn\u2019t changed. But when we left I cried. Why? I was born there. I grew up there. What I felt they took away my childhood. I had realized it before but it didn\u2019t\u2019 impact me as much as, my husband was sitting next to me on the plane. And it didn\u2019t impact me until I left. They took away my childhood. They did and for that and that\u2019s a small maybe price to pay in view of what others lost but don\u2019t forget I lost my family too. But I wasn\u2019t\u2019 in a camp. I didn\u2019t starve. We were very dirt poor when we first came to New York. All that was do-able and bear-able. But we\u2019re talking about me talking about me and how this whole part of history impacted me yeah it did. They took away my childhood. They took away what might have been for me, education wise. Many things. And The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

While I was there I wasn\u2019t even sad, other than various you know just moments here, moments there. Because we were kept busy. But then reflecting. I have reflected a lot since I came back. I was cheated also. Cheated. It was, they took away a chunk of my life, a big chunk. And I think it has impacted me, the way I act, the way I think and the way I behave, even into my 70s. And I\u2019m starting to fill up and I don\u2019t\u2019 want to. It\u2019s sad."
