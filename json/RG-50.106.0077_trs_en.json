He did not leave under the circumstances that my father did because he was able to return to Poland and visit.

We had another my parents ha d friends Jewish Polish friends, they tried to leave but they didn\u2122t. They had no children. People with children, it was a little harder, it was a little harder to pick up. Imagine yourself having to totally leave. I mean for that time it, maybe today it isn\u2122t. People are moving about the whole world. In those days they, they left for political reasons like my father did but then he had established himself in, and was raising a family.

Well we had to sneak that so instead of carrying a book bag, I mean this is just one relatively small example, although not so small. Carry instead of a book bag, a dress bag. Put a book in, lunch, no outside recess, quietly. Again the word surreptitiously went to school. Also you never knew what wa s going to happen to you on the outside. Is somebody going to pick on you. Is somebody going throw stones at me. Is somebody going to Interview with Jutta Levy 23 hit me. Is somebody call, going to call me dirty names and then as things progressed they did come into the schools, the SS people and very quietly and systematically escorted kids out of the school.

And that was not acceptable to him. I may have my dates a little muddled with that . But instead of he basically felt when that first offer came, no I ha ve a family.

Totally no livelihood, number one. Number two the Gestapo started hounding us. Nu mber three people were disappearing, people that we knew were disappearing. Kids were take n out from school, as I mentioned before, first very quietly, very nicely. And then not so nice. We lived in a very nice apartment building. You heard knocks at the door in the middle of the ni ght. More people were taken away. A few screams, screeches. Everything you know it was horri fic. We heard via my father and also via friends heard of people disappearing. Oh they were sent to on a train to no man\u2122s land which is out in the corridor. In fact that\u2122s the word I was looking for much earlier in the tape. And in the winter time. Because winter in Germany at th at time came early on, sometimes on my birthday there was snow on the ground and I was born very late in September. But they were sent out on a train and then chased off the train into no man\u2122s land. And if they tried to come back or plead they were shot. These things came back to us. Or they froze to death or got away. And these things got back to me, to my pare nts and also to me. And by this time I\u2122m already a pre-teen-er. Pre-teen. And so beginning to understand. But primarily for my father it was the total no job, no money coming in. Being released from his repres entation. And then his own business, what he did on you know himself was also nonexistent. A nd it was constant harassing of the Gestapo and threats and primarily people disappearing and wh at they heard. And never to be heard from again. And also other people making plans to leav e because Germany at the time that we\u2122re now at was in a state of frenzy to rid itself of Je ws. So before my uncle Max, Max Salzberg and his wife Alice left, we already knew that we had to also make plans.

He also needed to get this didn\u2122t, none of this happens overnight. He also needed to get permission from the Germans to ge t out, permission to leave. Might I add that all of us with the exception of my mother who had a Polish passport were stateless. And I was, my sister, my father obviously was. SO you start put ting into motion plans to leave which isn\u2122t like going to a consulate today, get a visa and off you go. It\u2122s a lot of was a lot of work and persistence. With the Germans definitely brib ing them. Making so called friends with them, well let\u2122s not call it friends, but it\u2122s bribing them and he did that. He bribed, he lied. He did he put every trick out of his bag that he could so that we would not be taken away. That didn\u2122t guarantee it. Did not guarantee it so he put into motion to leave. The affidavit from the uncle finally came. The permission from the Germans finally came. But we didn\u2122t have a visa from the US to come and that\u2122s where we almost didn\u2122t make it out because the Americans didn\u2122t want to give us a visa. I hate to say that. Sitting here in this beautiful country, but they didn\u2122t. And he had booked passage already for March of 39 which was changed because of a boat was being painted. So he changed it December of 38. That also didn\u2122t work out. The Aquitania so then he booked it for November of 38. With no proper papers. A nd my mother went, my mother, my sister and I went to Poland in October of 38 which was a harrowing trip which is a story all unto itself to say goodbye to the parents, the grandparents. Aunts, uncles, cousins. And when Interview with Jutta Levy 27 we came home my father said we\u2122re leaving. We\u2122re definitely leaving and that was within two weeks that we came back. And my mother said I can \u2122t leave. My curtains are wet. I\u2122m not this, I\u2122m not that. I\u2122m not packed. I don\u2122t have the thing. He said I\u2122m sorry we have to leave. And we did. But we didn\u2122t\u2122 have the visa so on the Saturd ay before we left we still didn\u2122t have it. We had pleaded, we had the way he was with the Germans because he couldn\u2122t, didn\u2122t bribe anybody at the American consulate. But he pleaded with them. He went every day practically. No visa, Mr. Salzberg, it\u2122s a quota it\u2122s a this, it\u2122s a that. Finally he went, took my mother, my sister Ruth and me down to the consulate. He insisted on seeing somebody. He was told nobody could see him. He says but you are going to see me, you are going to see us. Somebody has to see us. It was very dramatic, very compelling. There is no way that I can even describe that scene at the American consulate in Hamburg. There is no way. I can tell you about it and it\u2122s ever going to make the impact that it had on me anyway and I\u2122 m sure my sister and all of us, especially my father for the rest of our lives. This man finally let us in and we were told time and time again that you cannot have a visa today, the papers are not ready blah, blah, blah. We were like up on the fifth or sixth floor and my father said I\u2122ll tell you somethi ng. With what\u2122s going on we are leaving and if we are not leaving Germany we are going out that window. He starts pulling me, my mother and my sister over to the window. We were going to jump. He meant it because he knew that our time was up. We had so far been left pretty much alone. As far as we weren\u2122t\u2122 dragged away in the middle of the night like ma ny of our neighbors, let alone friends were. People in school were. We were pretty much left alone. But our time was, was up. So this fellow who was there, Mr. Davis knew that well Mr. Salzberg meant business. And we did get the visa that day. And then the rest of it is all pretty dramatic too. We le ft. Am I getting ahead of myself here. We left a few days later. We got to Col ogne. We left an apartment with furniture. Some Interview with Jutta Levy 28 things we had, my mother had sent away in an ticipation of leaving. We , we left. We got to Cologne but we left the housekeeper there. Her name was Frau Krug and we had a little parakeet that I entrusted to her. And all the bens and the furniture but the parakeet to me was my most important possession that I had to leave behind. We got to Poland the next morning. My father called her up. I was right there with him when he called and you could see his face drain of color. She told him, we left at, the train left at mi dnight. At 6 AM the following morning they came and they were furious, the Gestapo. These were the people in the black uniforms, the SS people came to take us away and when she told them that we had left they were furious. Absolutely furious. The destroyed our bedding. They destroyed our apartment, they trashed it. Bayonetted my bird, bayoneted this tiny little bird and beat her to a pulp. She was not a, see what she was doing anyway was illegal. She was, she was not a Jewish woman. I have no idea what she was. But she had nowhere to go so you know for her my father said listen. Whatever is here is yours. But what are you going to do with it. So she was in the apartment and they didn\u2122t\u2122 believe her. They, they beat her and destroyed everything. And that\u2122s how we know when they came. We have no other way of know. How would we know but for her. And we were very grateful to be where we were, but we were still in Germany. If this we re five years later with telecommunications being what they became, I don\u2122t\u2122 know that we would ha ve made it out. But we were in Germany and changed trains and came the next saga."

            "answer": "We had to get to Paris. Then we came to the border in Aachen and the Germans gave us one last send off. Took my father off the train as they came through to check the papers. You don\u2122t dare move in Europe. There are compartments and from each compartment. Remember we were not the only ones running. There were many peop le on the train, some with no luggage but many people like us. But they took my father off the train and you don\u2122t dare move. Every time we moved we had everything or my mother or anybo dy that Nazi out there with the bayonet pointed at you and he\u2122s ready. Any excuse, any excuse so let me see my father. He\u2122s talking and he\u2122s very animated and we had no idea. All of a s udden they say the train is going to move and it started to, move, start to move along slowly and we\u2122re hysterical. There we are. My mother and two kids and no husband. He\u2122s still talking to the Germans. Finally we saw him run and he got on the last what do they call it, the end of th e train. The man was 40 years old, suffered from high blood pressure. That he didn\u2122t have a heart attack then was amazing. What did they want from him. When he finally came into the compartment and told us was they said he had too much money on him. So he said well then take it. We don\u2122t do that. They didn\u2122t\u2122 offer him an alternative. He says well why can\u2122t you take it. He says we are honest, we are honest people. We don\u2122t take money. Well he had to come up with an alternative. He says well then I\u2122ll send it to Hamburg, to the housekeeper. Is that all right. at first they said no and then they said yes. But of Interview with Jutta Levy 30 course you know that she never got the money. And we\u2122re not talking about a whole lot of money because he came out with next to nothing . That\u2122s how, that was our goodbye and then once we crossed the border people started opening up. You know once we were sure there were no more Germans, now we\u2122re in Holland, Belgium. We\u2122re on our way to Paris. So we were very lucky."

                " I\u2122m going to pause now and change tape. Interview with Jutta Levy 31 (file 2 \u0152 RG-50.106.0077.02.03 \u0152 duration: 01:14:16) Esther Finder: This is an interview for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Today\u2122s date is September 15. This is a con tinuation of the September 8th interview with Jutta Levy. This is tape 2, side A. You have been telling me about your escape from Germany. But I wanted to go back and ask about something you had said previously a bout the last trip to Poland. YOU said it was a harrowing trip. Can you tell me about that trip? Jutta Levy: Well as I may have mentioned we went back at the insistence of my late mother. She wanted to have her last goodbyes to her parents and sister and all the relatives. So she took my sister and of course me, back to Poland. Now to go to Poland from Hamburg Germany, you get on the train and you have to go through no man\u2122s la nd. That\u2122s that stretch of land at that time, that was quote unquote free. That meant pass ing borders. You\u2122re going through border. Every border stop is a stop and the officials come on board. Well at that time, this is late 38, the Germans of course, the Nazis come on board an d searched, questioned, very body on the train. I didn\u2122t know at the time what strip search meant. I was a little past 12 years old and I found that out in a big hurry. Because of a matronly Ge rman woman took the women aside and strip searched them. I was one of them. And if anybody ha s ever been strip searched and especially by an angry, German official of the Nazis, strip searching a young Jewish girl, you can imagine what that was like. Not pleasant, not nice and without getting graphic very nasty and impersonal. It is one of the most unpleasant experience that I had personally and I think that\u2122s all I\u2122m going to say about that. I think one can imagine what that was like. They made it difficult. They let us go but they made it unpleasant, difficult, and also very, very frightening. I was dreading the trip Interview with Jutta Levy 32 back home because I hadn\u2122t even gotten there yet because I was afraid that I\u2122d have to go through that again. But mercifully I did not. They were very thorough about checking our luggage, checking us personally but this intense strip search was not repeated. But it was going out of Germany to Poland. Why they didn\u2122t do it on the way back quite in that manner I don\u2122t\u2122 know. It\u2122s was maybe a fluke or maybe the other was. I don\u2122t know. they were angry people that, I think if they had had the chance they would have thrown us off the train. Just to be never heard from again which they eventually, which they had already done and did more of. Again, we were lucky. Sometimes not knowing a lot of things, not knowing what had already been done is a blessing. "

            "answer": "in Hamburg where we lived as I said prev iously people began disappearing. Especially people, Aust Juden which are the Jews from eastern Eur ope began disappearing. My parents for instance had a couple. I can even remember their name, Mr. and Mrs. Max Steiner who disappeared. We learned later on I learned later on. My parents knew even before that they were rounded up. They were taken away put on a train, sent to what I keep referring to as no man\u2122s land in the dead of winter. Told to get off at a given point. Oh they weren\u2122t the only ones. There were hundreds of them. Told to get off the train. And just let go. Chased off the train, let go, in the dead of winter. If the people didn\u2122t move fast enough for them, they were shot. If they managed to get away, who knows where they went. Some managed to escape to other parts of the world. Others froze to death. Others were shot to death. These stories have been Interview with Jutta Levy 33 documented. These stories my father found out and I did to after a time. At the time that I\u2122m talking about now when we went legally to Poland, legally to Poland. I mean they could have done what they wanted to. But they didn\u2122t. At the time we did not know what had already been, the atrocities that had already been committed. We didn\u2122t\u2122 know. Communications as I\u2122ve said before was certainly nothing like it, not anywhere near what it is today. Had it been I don\u2122t think I\u2122d be having this interview."

            "answer": "Heart wrenching. Very heart wrenching. Not because of any dark premonitions, certainly not on my grandparents, my relatives side. In fact my grandfather was a very intelligent very this is not my maternal grandfather who is a professional man. Very far sighted very ahead of the times. But he could not foresee nor did he the tragedy that was to come to Poland. What was happening in Germany he felt as so many people did at that time, not so much anymore with German Jews. But living in Poland was like living in another world here or another, certainly a faraway country here. He just felt that it might pass. But he al so fully understood why we had to leave given the circumstances I\u2122ve described before. Lack of making a living, the name calling the antiSemitism is a mild word for what was happening. The burning destruction of synagogues. He was well aware of that. So with a lot of understanding he wished us of course the best but was sad to let us go. Not just him, all the family. It was a heart wrenching experience, much more so for my mother and it was for my sister and me too. I felt it maybe a little more keenly being older and I loved my family there dearly especially my grandparents, my maternal and my paternal grandmother in her, on my father\u2122s side. What wa s also very heart breaking I might add is that Interview with Jutta Levy 34 my father, my late father was never able to go back because of the reasons I stated before. Especially for his mother and his side of the fa mily. Realizing that we were leaving, realizing that perhaps they would never see him again was conveyed and understood by me even at my young age. So that whole trip was very fast. We didn\u2122t\u2122 stay long. And again very, very heart wrenching. Sad, sad."

But he had hypertension, I have Interview with Jutta Levy 36 hypertension. It\u2122s an inherited thing probably. But I\u2122m more keenly aware of a nervous stomach which I developed and I still have it. I don\u2122t know how to describe it. it\u2122s fear even to this day of a uniform. My father had a business here downt own and I\u2122m digressing a little bit and he made friends with all the police which was in downtown Washington y ears and years and years ago. Every time a police man would come up to collec t for something or just to come up and say hello, my father froze. Every time a uniform ca me in during the war.

And I wasn\u2122t, I had friends that were in the service, but the moment when you see a uniform that is the fear that developed over a period of time and you live under a regime for that many years. six years is a long time."

And there\u2122s another stop and more uniforms come in. The uniforms at this point though are Belgia n officials who spoke French and not German. So once we got past that and they were, they were official, they were to the point but even though we were fearful but there was nothing really to be afraid of at that point but as I said before, you don\u2122t get over that. Once we got through that border, don\u2122t\u2122 forget there were many other people on the train in the compartments othe r than us that were on the run. Some with only the clothes on their back, no luggage even. But then they started to talk a little bit. Without fearing that they would be arrested or they would be overheard for saying something that wasn\u2122t politically correct. And what stuck in my mind to this day is that people smuggled things out. In the most ingenious way. I remember one lady had I don\u2122t\u2122 know if it was a coat or a jacket but her big buttons about the size of maybe even bigger than a ha lf a dollar and she was so proud of herself, as well she should have been, that sh e was able to smuggle out diamonds that were hidden in the hollow of those buttons and I remember that and I was totally amazed. But in retrospect how she got away with that. How they didn\u2122t, I mean this was just one. People had other ways of bringing things across. But that, that was one thing that stuck in my mind. That they were so relieved that they almost started to share and I did this and I did that and they were saying, well they were basically trashing the Nazis which they hadn\u2122t been able to do all these years. Being afraid to be overheard or if somebody, if they fe lt they were with somebody that they could trust and they couldn\u2122t trust them. That was anothe r thing. So you know it goes on and on. It goes on and when you live under a regime like that and people like ourselves, people like myself it takes a while to trust again and to say wow I can say this. And believe it or not, Interview with Jutta Levy 38 even to this day and I\u2122m almost 71, even to this da y I can say that (fully?). I can say that. I can be critical. I have never ever taken that for granted."

But we don\u2122t want to be repetitious. I don\u2122t want to be. We got to Paris where my mo ther had her brother there and we stayed there waiting for the Queen Mary to take us to Ameri ca. While we were in Paris, an incident happened that really changed the rest of Germany forever. And that was the young Jewish fellow. He was a Americanized, Greenspan that was his name and he killed an attach\u00e9 in Paris of the German embassy. Most people are, historians are very much aware of that. This of course caused a tremendous upheaval in Ge rmany and that is a, it culmin ated what they call here now Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass because of what this young Jewish fellow did out of frustration, anger and whatever other emotion you can think of and I will say this, go on record and have said it before. That was the culminatio n this Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass. They had been doing these things, certainly in Hamburg and other places in Germany all that year and certainly all that fall and early winter while I was still in Germany. I heard oh yes, store fronts being broken into. And I knew of book burnings. I saw some of it. And I what I think we mean by Kristallnacht which we were still in Europe then. But it was the culmination of and so I only want to say that after that it was a miracle, as it was a miracle with us that we got out of Germany at the time that we did. After that we would not have been a relatively no it wasn\u2122t Interview with Jutta Levy 39 easy, but it would not have been let\u2122s say legally to use that term. Because we left legally. We had proper papers. After that there was no such thing. He was done with, Hitler was done with German Jews. If he hadn\u2122t annihilated them if we hadn\u2122t gotten out, their life wasn\u2122t worth a plugged nickel. Because shortly thereafter he moved into Poland."

When he and my uncle and other, we had other relatives in Paris were talking about this incident it was with (pause) regret that this had happened because it put in jeopardy so many people, which of course it did. It also was with some relief that we were out because had the, had we not left exactly when we did. And I mean almost to the minute, I wouldn\u2122t\u2122 be talking to you today. We got out just at the nick of time, six hours before the Gestapo came to my house. That this young man chose th at day that week to shoot the German attach\u00e9, causi ng tremendous uproar in Germany, and the fact that we were no longer there was very fortunate for us. So yeah we had there was a tremendous amount of relief. On my father, my parents\u2122 part and of course transcended to me. And even though I might have left with a lot of sadness leaving behind friends and stuff. And a life. I having had it explained to me what was going on at that point and papers being full of it, radio, I was to tell you that I was pretty happy being out of there. Naturally not knowing what was facing us in a new country, in a new life, but still we did not have to fear for the Nazis. There were other fears. So yes, generally that\u2122s the reaction. And again I\u2122m talking as someone who at that point was 12, a Interview with Jutta Levy 40 little over 12 years old.

And at 12 years old the hormones alr eady are working a little bit so of course I immediately fell in love with this young cousin. He wrote a beautiful poem in my autograph book.

This huge to me then and of course it is huge ship out there that we had to get on. And I have to tell you I was scared to death, but we got on the ship and started our voyage across.

To have people talk about it in German because that\u2122s all I spoke at the time , that was quite a moment. Thinking back on it now. Getting off the ship was quite something el se again. My father got down on his hands and knees and he kissed the concrete ground as he came off the boat. And that\u2122s a moment I won\u2122t forget.

Because as I started to tell you, I was here one day, new country, new language, new everything and my parents went off to Detroit Michigan where my father\u2122s two brothers were and I was to go with this great aunt and uncle who lived in Washington, DC, people that I didn\u2122t\u2122 know, really never heard of them, but this was my grandmother Salzberg, my paternal grandmother\u2122s sist er and her husband who said that they would take me because there was not enough room for me in Detroit. So since I was the older of the two daughters, I was the one that was elected to go with them. Now coming to a new country, being here one day, at most two days and one night and then le aving my parents and my sister was t, do you use the word traumatic. It was traumatic. I came here with them on the train. They were very nice people. They didn\u2122t\u2122 understand me, I didn\u2122t under stand them. They talked Yiddish but German and Yiddish people say are so much alike, but if your ear isn\u2122t used to it you don\u2122t understand. And they tried, maybe a little bit of German but it was I didn\u2122t understand and I had to go with them. And nobody\u2122s going to feel sorry for me b ecause they had a beautiful home. they were very well heeled people. He had a chauffeur driven car in Washington. And so I don\u2122t want anybody feeling sorry for me. I just felt sorry for me . It was my heart was aching. I was alone. I felt like I had been left, like I had been abandoned. And so I was not a happy person when I first came here. And I must say even though these people were wonderful, they meant well. The Ulmans, U-L-M-A-N. They were very good to me. They were generous. But I was very unhappy and very lonesome."

This is tape 2, side b and you were telling me a bout being separated from your parents and your sister and coming to the Washington DC area with other relatives. How long did you stay apart from your parents.",
            "answer": "About nine months. Nine months. Yeah and I want to say that I was comfortable. I had, my physical needs were taken care of. I was treated very well. They sent me to the Americanization school. They bought me a couple of more Americanized clothes. Not much, a little bit. They had other family here from his side. He was, Mr. Ulman was not my blood relative but his wife my aunt, great aunt I might say that part. So his he had family here and they weren\u2122t too nice to me but I frankly didn\u2122t\u2122 realize that until I understood a little bit more but they sent me to the Americanization school. Downtown at 13 th and New York Avenue. The building is still standing. So I was put in with, I was the only kid there. They were all adults. To say that I disliked it is putting it mildly. I hated it. And I don\u2122t think I got a whole lot out of it because I was frankly unhappy. I cried a lot. I cried myself to sleep. I don\u2122t\u2122 know. I woke up crying. I was lonesome. They tried very hard . I, I need to say that they tried hard and I guess they thought I was happy. They had a business here. He took me to the business with him. I had no chores to do. I basically had nothing to do. I would go the Americanization school which was not a good experience for me. They didn\u2122t put me into a school and I wonder, years later why not. But that\u2122s how it went. If my fa ther called I would cry and tell him how unhappy I was and a few months later he did make a trip to Washington to see me. I did not see my mother that whole time. And he came here and he promised that as soon as he could establish himself somewhere and he was hopeful it would be other than Detroit. He didn\u2122t\u2122 like Detroit. We would all get, be Interview with Jutta Levy 45 together again and at that time he looked around Washington and he really liked it but he at that time had no knowledge of how he would arrange making a living and coming here. So he went back to Detroit. About nine months later, maybe a little more but let\u2122s sa y nine, nine and a half months later my father did pick up with my mo ther and my sister and moved to New York. My mother had some cousins there. And he felt maybe that would be better. He didn\u2122t\u2122 like Detroit, didn\u2122t like what was going on there between the br others, et cetera. And he came to New York and once I knew that they were in I wanted to be there also. And he came and he got me. And from a beautiful home on Davenport Street in Nort hwest Washington I went with my, I went to a walk up apartment at 91 st and Amsterdam Avenue. Right al ong with the bedbugs, rats and the mice. But you know what I was happy cause we were all together at this point. Then he started to, he started to look for work do work. He sold hair ribbons, stockings. If he made two dollars he would spend it to buy then made two more do llars, spent, and bought kept the profits so we could eat and have the rent. We had very little money. We did not come here with bundles of money. He my mother made hair ribbons and my sister and I helped and various other things like that. And in the meantime all the while looki ng for some type of wor k. Without getting too wordy on this. About not too many months, not too many months, he found a position representing a company that sold basically the same things that he sold in Germany. For the territory that encompassed Wash ington, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. So he started thinking about making the move to Washington so he could be closer to the territory that he was to represent. And that was for him a dream come true because he already liked New York. He didn\u2122t\u2122 love it, but he did love Washington. A good reason. It wa s a beautiful city. It was cleaner at that time. Than New York and very much like Hamburg. He always used to say it reminded him, it was that type of city. So I would say w ithin a year\u2122s time we ma de a move here. And I Interview with Jutta Levy 46 might add, I did start public school in New York. In those days they put you in class. It was sink or swim. Or is it swim or sink. I don\u2122t know. Bu t I was put into sixth grade which of course I promptly flunked because I didn\u2122t know how to talk but I did have a young girl in my class. I know her name because she did an autograph. May Corbet who was a black girl who helped me. The only person in that class in New York that helped me. How I don\u2122t even remember. I guess with sign language and little by little I started to learn English. I also listened to the radio a lot. And went to the movies a lot, a lot. Because that was an escape. And it was, and I liked it. I was a movie fan in Germany and just a fan of theater and movies theater in Germany so I went to the movies a lot. In New York and of course continued it here. But I did lose some schooling along the way. Number one I didn\u2122t go to school. Number two I flunked and but here I am."

You know my father\u2122s mother wrote and her family wr ote for her and my grandfather wrote. So we were already in Washington when we heard about the invasion of Poland. And I have to say that it was devastating news to my parents. Heari ng that the Germans had marched into Poland. We then knew nothing further. As far as the what happened in Europe, in all of Europe as it became war torn, it was a tragedy it was te rrible. Again what happened other than the, the fact that I had so much family in Poland but the fact that I ha d friends over here who at that point being 17, 18 years old drafted into the army or signing up fo r the army maybe, whatever going into service. And some of them never to come back. Or h earing almost immediately they were killed. Because already I\u2122m a, at this point I\u2122m a teenager too.

            "answer": "Primarily the fact that my parents tried very ha rd to get in touch with their families in Poland. Never hearing again. There was conversation that things were very difficult in Poland for our families there. We did not and I reiterate did not know all the ramifications of what was happening. But we knew I should say the adults, my parents knew that whatever it was, it wasn\u2122t good. And having escaped from that regi me ourselves, we knew that whatever was happening wasn\u2122t good. It was a constant fear of what was happening over there. To our families. And we\u2122re talking Poland specifically. My father was a news hound. He liked, he wanted to listen to the radio constantly when he wasn\u2122t, when he was home. WE didn\u2122t dare talk while he was listening to the news because he was anxious to know every little bit that there was of what was going on in the world. Primarily in Europe and more specifically in Poland. And not a whole to came out. Again, given the lack of knowledge as far as communication is concerned as we know it today. Some things leaked out of course, not leaked out but became known but again things move very swiftly once that Hitler marched into Poland. It was a progression that went along very swiftly as history tells us today. And we all know it. Poland was not the only stop he made. He made quite a few other stops and it was a constant search for news and for us specifically. But of course my father became agitated every country that he went into. That Hitler went in to, he was agitated. And he was in a constant state of agitation and frustration. And also making a living, making a living. My mother worked and at 14 I went to work. I don\u2122t know what else to say about that period."

At that time we were already in a two bedroom apartment. To begin with we were four people in a one bedroom apartment. And shortly before Pearl Harbor we moved to a two bedrooms and at 2:00 I took my bath. And I heard my father about that time yelling that the Japanese had at tacked Pearl Harbor. And I did not know where Pearl Harbor was. Obviously he did. And I quickly got out and I thought what\u2122s going on, what\u2122s going on and he explained that Pearl Harbor was in Hawaii which was at that time a US possession or protectorate. I don\u2122t know what you call it. And essentially we would be at war with the Japanese. I have to tell you though that ther e was a little bit of a lilt to him, to my dad because he felt that once the Japanese, once Amer ica and at that time Roosevelt had not been declared but he and his friends and there was lots of talking going on. Once they declared war on the Japanese, as certainly they did it wouldn\u2122t be too long before we would declare war on Germany. And they were waiting for that, they were waiting for that. As much as people didn\u2122t want to go war in America or Americans to go to war, people like my dad and at this point we too felt better get in there. Have to put a stop to what\u2122s going on. So it was horrible, horrible, horrible. And things happened so quickly within a period of two, three days. First Japan, then Germany and of course we knew about the Blitzkr ieg and we at this time knew I don\u2122t want to jump ahead of me."

For several years I had a guttural accent. Germany was not popular. Having a guttural German accent, didn\u2122t exactly make me queen of the day. I fought hard and bitter to lose it, got into fights. Kids made fun of me. People that I\u2122m friends with to this day made fun of me and I had, I was a tomboy. I had fights with them. I\u2122d beat them up, they\u2122d beat me up. As far as anti-refugee as my parents ex, might have experienced it, I don\u2122t think so. My father was a personable man, a likeable person. Straightforward, honest man and he made a living, starting to make a living, worked hard. My mother did and as I said I went to work at 14 myself.

My parents were about, and other people, but we\u2122re specifically talking about my family. We knew that many evil things had gone on there and I refer to them as evil things as opposed to say anything else. Just how bad and how our families were affected, we really didn\u2122t know. It was a nightmare that was going to come true. Then we got a telephone call from Sweden, from moth er\u2122s sister. Flora Kerner at that time. And, telling us that she and my, her daughter my cousi n, Rita, had survived but that everyone else in our family had perished. I remember my father being on the telephone and falling to his knees because he was so very emotionally upset, draine d. And very other thing that you can name.

And th at\u2122s where my aunt called from. It took several days after liberation because they were very generous from what I understand about having survivors call but my aunt had not been well. She had contracted typhus, I believe it was. So it took a few days, maybe not even extra days, but it took time. and there were thousands and thousands of extra people in various camps that were trying to reach family all over the world. But she did call us and she told us at that time, she would call us again when they got to Sweden because that was where they were going."

These things started late in the war years, or end, towards the end of the war. Don\u2122t forget soldiers were already coming back. Not that he met them personally. Some yes, so me not, but there was the media and so he did know about camps, crematoriums. He knew about Dachau, or he knew about Dachau early on but not knowing exactly Dachau came into existence as I said, I think I said earlier in 33. But the atrocities that were being committed were some body\u2122s worst nightmare and hearing them prior to getting this telephone call and from the news media and the people that had already come back so, wounded soldiers et cetera, made it, it becam e very factual and he could only, we could only Interview with Jutta Levy 53 imagine what had happened to our own family. However, always hopeful that perhaps they weren\u2122t as touched as so many thousands, millions were. At that point we weren\u2122t thinking in terms of millions. We didn\u2122t\u2122 know. At least I didn\u2122t know but we knew that bad things had happened over there. We could only hope that we would get some good news that families had survived, some of our family if not all had surv ived. Hearing that they hadn\u2122t other than my mother\u2122s sister and her daughter was in one way of course very good news. But in another it was horrific. It was my mother and my father were de vastated as was I. At that point already I was on my way, I was and adult just about, an adult already and I remembered being very pained, very, very pained. To say the very least. It\u2122s an awful feeling to hear that all your family that you left behind but two people had perished. And at that time we really didn\u2122t know exactly who died in which way. We didn\u2122t know that exactly until they came here. And I\u2122m getting ahead but my aunt and my cousin came here after Sweden, not too in 1946. So about a year, a little over a year after they were liberated. My father brought th em home. He, if you like I can tell you when they called him from Sweden which was maybe a week after their initial call, he immediately went and I went with him, this is now 1945. Immediat ely went to I believe it was the Red Cross. I remember going on a Saturday downtown with him and getting, wiring off to the Red Cross and the wire services, $50, which to us was like it would be $5000 today. Got it together and sent it to my aunt and my cousin in Sweden. And with which he then went to work to bring them here. Which he did. He had them sponsored by my aunt , the lady that I lived with here. They were moneyed people as I said. He got her to sign the affidavit. She didn\u2122t blink an eye and signed it, not with all the problems that we had. And we tr ied to get her over here and did of course. And but we paid for their passage, and we set up an apartment for them where we lived. And he went and, and worked very hard, along with my moth er. And I remember going with him to these Interview with Jutta Levy 54 various places to bring them over here. So I want to give him, my father and my mother all respect and credit that\u2122s due them for acting as quickly as they did in seeing to the comfort and to bringing these two survivors over into what my father called the land of milk and honey which he was not an original of that expression. But he loved America and the o pportunities that it gave him and he wanted them here."

We were basically the same age and in fact we recently talked about this very thing I\u2122m telling you now. I asked her, what was it like? What was camp, concentration camp like? Well for two hours or more my cousin told me gr aphically as graphic as she could get exactly what camp was like, what ghetto was like, what cam p was like for her because I have since heard other stories but that was my first. And I was absolutely horrified. Talk about nightmares, if I didn\u2122t\u2122 have terrible nightmares before, I sure had them after that. Here was somebody in front of me that had lived through thes e horrors and they were other people that had worse stories. But her story and it\u2122s been documented was not pleasant , it was horrible. What my aunt and she went through and my family. Telling me that how my grandparents died, how my, my father\u2122s family died, how my cousins, my aunts, my uncles, how they all died at various stages of the internment, in the gas chambers, in the ghettos, ju st disappearing. One goes to the left, the other one goes to the right. One meant certain death, on e was uncertain. Hearing all that just between the two of us was about one of my worst experi ences and I\u2122m sure it was, I think probably the first time that she really talked about it. And for years and years and years afterward, we never Interview with Jutta Levy 55 talked about it again. My cousin\u2122s name is Rita, R-I-T-A, Levine Hilton. And she for a time lived, for a long time lived in New York but my aunt remarried. My aunt\u2122s name was Flora Klinnert Kerner. K-E-R-N-E-R. and she married a gentleman here by the name of Adin, A-D-IN so her name the last 40 years after they came here until she died. Anyway they were married over 40 years. Was Flora Adin, A-D-I-N. She was a de ntist also. I have a feeling that that kept her from being exterminated because she could te nd to patients that had from what she told us horrible diseases in the mouth because of malnutrition, et cetera. And they tried the Germans, to for the Red Cross anyway for people who came to put up an appearance that they were doing all that they could, quote unquote. Of course that was all nonsense. My cousin Rita Hilton\u2122s testimony is on file at the US Holocaust Museum as well as Shoah. She gave testimony to Shoah also. Her testimony is or will be viable."

You had just told me about your talk with your cousin when she told you of her experiences in the Holocaust and I wanted to ask you how was the news of the death camps presented in this country, in the American media? Jutta Levy: Well in those days we had newsreels. And which most everyone at this point has seen. That\u2122s all we had at the time, well th at\u2122s all you have. How was it presented. It was presented graphically and with certain amount of disbelief. I think th e disbelief is to this day. The disbelief. Not that people didn\u2122t believe it. But my god in heaven, how could this have happened. Virtually under our noses. How could such a thing have happened? Never did my family or I ever, ever become used to seeing those pictures or those images. They we re shown here not just by the news media, in the news and in the movies . Didn\u2122t have television, just yet. But it was not easy to take. It really was very difficult but the main thing was how was it that this government, you\u2122re talking about the American government, how is it that this could have happened. How was it that they didn\u2122t know. And if they did know why didn\u2122t they do more to help? Why didn\u2122t\u2122 they put a stop to it? As though that was so easy. But these are questions that bubbled up. There was a certain amount of anger amongst pe ople like, like us. How could this have happened. Ok we didn\u2122t know about it. Or we didn\u2122t\u2122 have as much of a clue as maybe the governments didn\u2122t. What did they do? Why wa s it allowed to happen? There was anger.

These atrocities that we h eard about and then saw in the news, newsreels, Interview with Jutta Levy 57 atrocities that my generation, my parents\u2122 genera tion and people of their, of the generation before have never even dreamt of, could not even visuali ze other than for the pictures. Anger, sadness. Disbelief, just as when my cousin sat and talked to me. I don\u2122t\u2122 think I said a word. For two, better than two hours and believe me, if you knew me it\u2122s not easy for me not to talk. I was totally in shock at hearing that something like this went on and the world stood by. And now as an old woman I have to say how could the world have stood by. I didn\u2122t\u2122 understand it then, I don\u2122t\u2122 understand it now. "

And the Nuremberg trials and the birth of the state of Israel. Did you see any changes in the Jewish community from when you first arrived.",
            "answer": "That\u2122s a very tough question because you know for as many people as there are and as many people as I knew not that it is that many, but you get different reactions. Totally different reactions. This, I have to tell you amongst a lot of people and Jews too there\u2122s a lot of apathy. I think that\u2122s the right word. The war was over, si x million Jews plus perished. What a horrible, Interview with Jutta Levy 60 horrible thing. Now this Is years back. we\u2122re talking from, you\u2122re asking me about that. Terrible. It must never happen again. I don\u2122t\u2122 really think that it all sank in. There are too many things happening. Same with the state of Israel. That th ere are your true Zionists who absolutely were thrilled. My father one of them. Thrilled with the fact that th ere was a state of Israel. But you also found a lot of ok it\u2122s done, let\u2122s get on with it type of attitude. And the ramifications of all what we\u2122ve been talking about the last few minut es, didn\u2122t\u2122 really come to a, well there\u2122s no concluding cause nothing is over. But the full impact didn\u2122t come til many, many, many years later. I would say as recently as 15 years ago, 20 years ago. That people really began well when those survivors started speaking. They haven\u2122t been talking all that long. I for one started to talk about my own experience when my kids got real ly involved in their high schools, at Blair High school. The teacher wanted to ask my older daughter who is now 44, is anybody in class who has a mother or father that is survived the Hitler regime that was from Poland or Germany or Romania, or Russia or whatever. And the only on e in the class that raised their hand was my daughter. Shannon. And the teacher said well sh e asked about me and my daughter was told her that oh yes my mom was born in Hamburg Germany and she lived under Hitler for six years. My four year old grandchildren when they were at that age that this Grandma came from Hamburg Germany. Hamburger Germany. Anyway she said my, told her that the mom that she was born in Hamburg Germany, came over here and the teac her said would your mother be interested in talking and my daughter says I don\u2122t\u2122 know. Anyway teacher called me. And I did talk to all the classes during that year of that and then, and then the teacher. I don\u2122t know if the same teacher did, I did it for my younger daught er also when she four years later followed. But you know up until except for isolated cases, do you know they di dn\u2122t\u2122 speak. The survivors did not speak if Interview with Jutta Levy 61 you want to call me a survivor. Or a refugee, it really doesn\u2122t\u2122 matter. Bu t we didn\u2122t talk about it. Who wanted to hear it?"

I won\u2122t\u2122 even begin to tell you all the things that I\u2122ve done. But then primarily for my father in his business. I work ed hard. I worked with both my parents. My father got sick early on so I ran a business. I have to say that. I ran a business. I got married in 1952. We held onto that business. My father was very ill, required, he could never get the proper life insurance because of his hypertension. We, he had the best of care. we tried very much, very hard to keep him going but he died at 55. He accomplished a lot in a very short time. Married off two daughters in style, college educated, two daughters at George Washington University. Had a home. lived we ll, way beyond his means. So by the time he died we were pretty well tapped out. So but we rebounded. My husband went to work for the government. I went to work for various people. In the jewelry business, in the travel business, in a doctor\u2122s office. Too many things to name. We\u2122ve had and I have a, we always have even when my parents were alive a nice life, pleasant.

The city of Hamburg has invi ted people like myself back and two years ago my husband and I went as gues ts, everything paid for. What was that like? The day I got there I knew how to get back to my apartment. And we took the subway whatever. I knew exactly where to get off. It\u2122s amazing how everything came back. I saw the apartment, I saw ultimately the school where I went. Not the pub lic school, the private school. I went into the building, into the apartment. I went into the back yard where I had to be so quiet. During our recess. Went to the downtown branch of the school , saw what was left of my synagogue. That\u2122s Interview with Jutta Levy 63 unusual that that fa\u00e7ade is standing. The only thing th at remains of it is th e front of it because it was granite and it had been relatively newly built. They couldn\u2122t burn granite. The Hebrew lettering is there and I have pictures of that. What was my you asked me what was my impression going back. The area that I lived in was not bombed or harmed so basically it was somewhat frozen in time. The downtown area ha s was completely bombed and rebuilt. It\u2122s a very rich city moneywise. Pros, prosperous is a better word. I did get to see some special places that we used to go to. I also had the opportunity to go to the concentration camp Bergen Belsen where to me that\u2122s like a cemetery because people that I knew and loved I think perished there. I\u2122m not even sure but certainly my cousin and her mother had survived it. it\u2122s been sanitized. It\u2122s become like a memorial and I will say that the Germans do visit there because they have very few Jews in Hamburg. Very few. Bergen Belsen is about two hours outside of Hamburg which I didn\u2122t even know. Between Hamburg and Hanover. I di dn\u2122t know that. Til I got there. I\u2122ve forgotten that you asked me. The overall impressi on. I was sad. When I left the plane took off and I looked down at the city where I was born and I was sad and I cried, the only time I cried. Oh I shouldn\u2122t\u2122 say that. I did cry in the back yard of the school because it hadn\u2122t changed. But when we left I cried. Why? I was born there. I grew up there. What I felt they took away my childhood. I had realized it before but it didn\u2122t\u2122 impact me as much as, my husband was sitting next to me on the plane. And it didn\u2122t impact me until I left. They took away my childhood. They did and for that and that\u2122s a small maybe price to pa y in view of what others lost but don\u2122t forget I lost my family too. But I wasn\u2122t\u2122 in a camp. I didn\u2122t starve. We were very dirt poor when we first came to New York. All that was do-able and bear-able. But we\u2122re talking about me talking about me and how this whole part of history impacted me yeah it did. They took away my childhood. They took away what might have been for me, education wise. Many things. And Interview with Jutta Levy 64 once I got that out of my system on the plane go ing from Hamburg to Frankfurt, I became sad. While I was there I wasn\u2122t even sad, other than various you know just moments here, moments there. Because we were kept busy. But then reflecting. I have reflected a lot since I came back. I was cheated also. Cheated. It was, they took away a chunk of my life, a big chunk. And I think it has impacted me, the way I act, the way I thi nk and the way I behave, even into my 70s. And I\u2122m starting to fill up and I don\u2122t\u2122 want to. It\u2122s sad."
