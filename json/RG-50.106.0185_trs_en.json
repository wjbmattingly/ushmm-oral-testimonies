I don\u2019t think I was quite as smart as I thought I was. But I was fairly bright. Which has stood me in good stead over the years. In fact I guess growing up when I did I grew up sort of confrontational and I think it stood me well all my life. I like to say I\u2019ve never been aggressive but I\u2019ve always been assertive. Fine distinction but a good one."

You know it\u2019s, take my word for it. It was very famous. And the Brachhaus family lived across the street from us and Leipzig of course was a publishing city. And very few people know that but you know the, not pocketbooks but paper backs, quality paperbacks were published in Leipzig long before the, the names were coined. Because we had these publishing houses in Leipzig and boy I had a whole collection of English novels that I read by the time I was ten years old. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ruth Rappaport 9 October 14, 2010"

And it was immersion study. You had breakfast with your teachers. You went for a walk. You couldn\u2019t use anything but English. If you couldn\u2019t say it in English, you couldn\u2019t say it. It was agony while it lasted. However, when I came to the States as an immigrant, I didn\u2019t have to take a single required English college course. I passed every single college course, high school and college entrance by exam. The only thing I couldn\u2019t pass was Shakespeare."

I decided these people all these people showed up in nightgowns. And I decided they needed toothbrushes. And so I looked up a man who had a sundry shop.

And invariably they wouldn\u2019t say who are you or where are you from or what is your background. What I was getting was, oh you as, for an American you are speaking in excellent German. Now this is a whole bunch of bullshit because I do not speak excellent German. I speak a teenage German. I speak a slang German. Well not really, semi https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ruth Rappaport 47 October 14, 2010 slang. And it was the German way of trying to find out who, what I am, without being too inquisitive was this line of your German for an American is so good. Da, da, da, da, da. And as I say it\u2019s just a slangy colloquial every day teenage German that I speak but that was their way of trying to place me. And what was interesting, among all those travels we did, there was one hotel that was closed that we needed a place to stay. And the hotel people gave us a key to the whole hotel and let us stay 1n it. I mean it was really sort of phenomenal the kind of nice experiences we had when we went traveling. And it all seemed to have something to do with, as I said, people recognizing that they were too polite to do too much fishing but they knew there was a story. And so without being too obviously curious they accepted the story."

And I guess she was forever grateful that somebody did such a nice thing for her. And at the time, we had a drink at the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco, Golda gave me a dirty look and she said, the trouble is people like you don\u2019t\u2019 come to Israel. You\u2019re the kind of person we need. To get things going. To get things done, to get things accomplished. But no you raise money to send other people. And them was fighting words. And I said don\u2019t bet on it. Next thing I\u2019m sitting in Golda\u2019s office and said, in Tel Aviv and I\u2019m saying I would like to join the army. And she said what\u2019s the matter with you? Why the army. And I said because when working in the kitchen Ill learn Hebrew and she said no, if you\u2019re working in the kitchen you\u2019|l be learning how to peel potatoes. She was a very practical lady you know. She had her feet firmly on the ground. And so I said well if it\u2019s not the kitchen."

She said with your command of English and your knowledge of newspaper work and publicity, and that\u2019s when I got busy and I did we did pack, information packets each month. To Anglo language consulates. And I did the selection of all the pictures and the story line. I wrote the features. But I think https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Ruth Rappaport 56 October 14, 2010 looking back, I didn\u2019t initiate all that much. I just never let an opportunity slip. I mean I was kind of Johnny on the spot. And I guess it was always sort of you know well what if goes wrong. so what. And I just didn\u2019t worry about results too much. But one of my, I guess one of the things that was sort of pleasing to me is among placing photographs for publication we had a Canadian tank commander who was a Machal volunteer and I got his picture into Life magazine. And I thought that was an accomplishment. And I think that my biggest contribution to this whole English publicity bit was that I took a very firm stand and I said the pick and shovel days are over. Israel needs big time money to get off the ground. You don\u2019t get big time money and support of paving a road with a pick and ax. And so I said get away from this dumb publicity of the pioneer who does everything and get this, the people who are starting a state. And so all my publicity was geared to income producing like I did a wonderful series on Tapu Hai Za\u2019havy [ph], the Golden Apples. I mean oranges. But orange export could to for the economy."

I\u2019m sort of waiting to see how all of this is going to play is I think the one thing that our president is doing right 1s the one thing he\u2019s hurt by. Because as he says, he\u2019s not a black president, he\u2019s a president who is black. And I think the blacks have it in for him because he won\u2019t be a black president. And I think that\u2019s too unfortunate. And I\u2019m sort of afraid that he may be a one term \u2014 kind of too sad because it\u2019s his own folks who turn against him. I think the white population is much more charitable in terms of accepting him. I think the blacks are disappointed because he isn\u2019t playing to the blacks. It\u2019s unfortunate because I say that\u2019s the one thing he is doing. We\u2019Il see what happens but I\u2019m looking a little, the political scene looks a little dismal right now."
