So he said he would do anything she should stay there. So she said, okay, I'll stay if you provide me with cigarettes. Cause at this time cigarettes were \u2014 were rationed. And he actually went out and kept her supplied with \u2014 she hadn\u2019t smoked before she came to England, but it\u2019s a habit she started, she started chain-smoking.
