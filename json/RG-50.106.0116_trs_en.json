In preparation for this interview, I watched the videotape of the interview you conduc ted with the Holocaust eyewitness project of Washington, D.C. in 1989, and listened to part of the audiotape interview you conducted with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Washington on March 5th, 1985. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in those interviews. Instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on those interviews and focus on your post-Holocaust experi ences. This is tape number one, side A. What was your name at birth?",

Because in Germany the Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 5railroad tracks were bombed. This was already 1945, you see, most of the time, to tell you the truth, didn\u2122t know exactly when, what time it was. But later we found out that the war was getting \u0152 was almost of the brink of being finished, except we didn\u2122t realize. But when we stopped at our \u0152 in our train because the railroad tracks were bombed, we couldn\u2122t go \u0152 excuse me \u0152 much farther. So what had happened, while we were waiting there for repairs, the SS had this speech to us, he said hey, you ought to be very happy, because this is April 20th, 1945, it\u2122s Hitler\u2122s birthday. And we, we were thinking why in the hell should we be happy that it\u2122s Hitler\u2122s birthday? But of course he said we will give you an extra piece of bread to celebrate it. And no sooner did he finish as the whol e sky became black and we were actually bombed. Our trains were hit by the allies. Not direct, but next to it. And actually, we were like about 3,000 women, probab \u0152 [coughs] excuse me \u0152 probab \u0152"

We hid out. We couldn\u2122t stay there too long, because after all, they didn\u2122t give us that extra piece of bread, so we couldn\u2122t do a \u0152 hide out too much, Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 6and we finally came out and we spotted th is Russian \u0152 he was like a \u0152 probably like a colonel in the army. And we ran over to him and he said, do n\u2122t worry, you are free. And that\u2122s how we actually were liberated, which was already like not exactly April 20th, because it took us like two days longer. But apparently, the Russians were already there. I always say, had the Germans left us in that camp, we probably would have been liberated by the Americ ans, because I think where we were liberated was almost very near where the Americans and the Russians met, near the Elbe river."

If we wanted to get some bread \u0152 because we didn\u2122t have like what the Americans did on the American zone, a displaced pe rsons camp where they fed you. With the Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 8Russians you didn't have anything like this . The only thing what they did for you, we would go to them and say take \u0152 let\u2122s go to a German bakery with us. And they would go with us and they would requisition from the ba ker, bread for us. So we \u0152 and we, our type of eating wa s very crude. Bread and water, that\u2122s all we needed, you know, to keep us alive. So that\u2122s what we got, we got mostly bread and water. Because even when we got into a German house, even if we saw some food there, you know, because what was happening after the war, a lot of German households became empty. Why? Because the Germans were afraid of the Russians and they were running towards the Amer ican zone. So they left a lot of their homes with no one there. So when we woul d go in, we would find maybe some food over there. I remember in one place, they had to spe \u0152 these beautiful, you know, like fruits, apples and cherries put in in jars, like we put away sometimes fruits. We were afraid to eat them because we thought that maybe they poisoned it. So we wouldn\u2122t even touch this.

But we were Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 10traveling in this horse and buggy a little bit. During the day, let\u2122s say where we \u0152 if we were in a certain town during the day, we would sp lit up a little bit and go into different places to sleep. Like we would sleep where the horses would sleep in \u0152 in some kind of \u0152 what do they call them, the barns, like. Or the pigs, or some others, because we were actually very much afraid of \u0152 of raping, because during the war, you see, i-in Germany, I never worried about being raped by a German, because this was something that they were not allowed to do. If \u0152 if a German got caught raping a Jewish girl, he was in trouble. So they usually stayed away from us. They probably were raping more German women."

We would march on. We \u0152 like I said, we had this horse and buggy, so we could move on a little bit more. And also, we met some Italian guys who must have been working in Germany. You know, they came to Germany to work. And they were also like trying to get back.

First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very \u0152 from the bombs, she was a little bit more in \u0152 and sh-she \u0152 you know, like she lost a couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us. You know, like I had a little bit of a i-injury, you know, like a shrapnel? A piece of shrapnel got into my hand, but it wasn\u2122t \u0152 you know, I never felt it. You know, it wasn\u2122t dangerous for me. But with her, we had to put her in in a hospital. So she actu ally stayed in the hospital. We couldn\u2122t, you see, we couldn\u2122t keep on staying in the same town for too long because we were actually afraid of this. So we actually had to leave her in the hospital, but there was another friend th at she met that stay ed with her. So she was like more or less taken care of. But we kept on going and probably took us probably like about three weeks til we got to the Polish border. And when I got there \u0152 and you know, as you were walking \u0152 you see, when we were liberated, would you believe that most of us didn\u2122t realize that most of our families were murdered? We still were hoping that maybe somebody\u2122s gonna be alive because I Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 13will tell you, in a way maybe that was good, because that\u2122s what kept us through all the other times, kept us going, because if not we probably at one time or another, we would have given up. But that was, in a way, kept us \u0152 hey, you stay alive because you promised that we\u2122re gonna meet at home. You know, like my boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, when they were separate \u0152 when they separated us in Auschwitz he said to me, if we stay alive, just remember, meet me in mine hometown. But also, he didn't know that my mother told me this, when we were, you know, it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said, just remember, if God forbid we should get separated \u0152 you see, never thinking that what\u2122s going to happen, that it\u2122s going to be this mass killing, but just separated. If we go, maybe I was someplace else or something, she says, remember, after the war, we\u2122ll meet in our place, you know , in our home. So naturally, the first thing what I wanted to do is get back home. So I did. That\u2122s how \u0152 and most of us \u0152"

They weren\u2122t maybe bombed as much, because they weren't bombed by the allies, the allies [indecipherable] had lots of bombs. And I dropped \u0152 I will never forget this, I drove \u0152 I \u0152 I didn\u2122t driv e, how do you call it? I brought this horse and buggy on the station and left it there ju st like that because actually, we were 15 girls, no one wanted to go near the horse. I said to them, you went through such a war. You\u2122re afraid of a little horse? I mean, he was that \u0152 he probably w-wa \u0152 I wish all through the war I would have ha d the dealing with the horse and \u0152 other than with the people.

This street was Jerome Skakel(ph), he was a Polish writer, the name of the street, was actually the main street of the city and the number of the bu ilding was 21, and a \u0152 I walked in. And no Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 18sooner did I go in, I haven\u2122t even \u0152 because we lived a little bit farther into the place, and I had this idea that I was going to walk in into my place, knock on the door, because by then I really knew already that most of our \u0152 my family was dead. And I \u0152 but I figured I will knock at the door and just ask it. Tell them who I am. Maybe if somebody else from my family comes and ask \u0152 tell him that the sister is alive. And I was also going to ask him, yo u know what? I lost all my pictures in Auschwitz, and it always bothered me that here I lived through it and I don\u2122t even have a picture to look at it. You know, it\u2122s \u0152 it seems so funny, because when you have access to it, i-it really isn\u2122t that important, but I hear more and more people when their homes are on fire or something they run back. For what do they run back? For their pictures. And the same thing I thought maybe when we left for the ghetto. My mother couldn\u2122t take everything . I\u2122m sure she took some pictures, but she prob \u0152 maybe she left some pictures and maybe these people would have those pictures. That wouldn\u2122t mean anything. But no sooner did I walk in into that place, you know, walked through this back gate, somebody caught me and said Reginka (ph). Reginka (ph), by the way, is a name for \u0152 like Regina. It\u2122s \u0152 in Polish you use it like a diminutive, yeah. Say hey , Reginka(ph), what are you doing here? They just shot Gudsztat (ph), otherwise a neighbor of ours, came back. He came back maybe a month before. They used to have a jewelry store before the war, and Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 19he took back the jewelry store. I mean, the Russians weren\u2122t yet in Poland like later on they came in. As it was, later on it didn\u2122t make any difference because the Russians took away from it. But he took back the jewelry store that belonged to his family. Somebody came, knocked at the door, th at same time that I came in into our city, and killed him. And this girl grabbed me, she says, let \u0152 g \u0152 run. And she and me started running. And where do we run? There\u2122s no place where to run. We run into where the ghetto used to be in Radom. They had \u0152 they made like out of a warehouse, they made like almost like a \u0152 a \u0152 what they call a \u0152 a community center, you know, so when \u0152 because so many people were coming back into the city and they had no place where to go. So at least you should be able to put down your head and what we used to do, in a pl ace like this, we would \u0152 they would have like sheets of paper on the wa lls, and you would put in your name. So at least I felt like \u0152 so I put down my name, and \u0152 Regina Gutman , am \u0152 you know, so maybe if somebody will look through, they will find me or if they know [indecipherable] of course, nobody found me except my boyfrie nd by then already heard that I got back to Radom and I \u0152"

She just came down to see who else was coming, because she actually was able to take back her apartment. She came back with a stepmother and she, when she saw me , she said, don\u2122t stay here, you can come and stay with us in our apartment. So I went with her in the apartment.

But really til then, I can\u2122t figure out, because it took us at least, by the time I caught up with him, it was like, I would say, almost like towards the end of May. For a month to six weeks, we lived from Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 25day to day, whatever came along. It was like an \u0152 struggling from day to day.

And I watched, for the first time in my life, I watched the people of Prague , the way they were greeting their president. They were hanging out from their windows and they were \u0152 with such love and I figured, if people can have so much love for their president, that\u2122s how much I knew about \u0152 you know, it somehow \u0152 I always say, with g \u0152 all going through all that war, I still, when I was liberated I was still this Pollyanna, what they used to call me when I was a kid, that I could never see any bad in other people. So here, I looked here at these people greeting the president and I turned around to say, they must be wonderful people. I never knew about Czechoslovakia except what I learned in the history books. I mean, after all, when the war broke out, I was 13 years old, how much did I lear n about other countries, you know? But I always was \u0152 loved, you know, geography and history. So I knew a little bit about them, but I didn't know about them, but I di dn't know about nature of people. But when I saw them greet like this, I said you know, we should stay here. But you know why we didn\u2122t? We probably wouldn\u2122t mind. Because we heard that you had to be born there in order to become a citizen \u0152 to be a citizen. Otherwise, if you weren\u2122t born there, you never become a citizen. So we were worried. What if it comes in something changes, we\u2122re the first ones to be shipped out like they did in Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 28Germany, to a lot of Jews in Germany, because if they weren\u2122t from Germany, they shipped them out. And by then, little by little we found out that the Americans were there. And also they \u0152 we got co \u0152 some people contacted us.

They said they\u2122re taking us to Germany, we\u2122re going to Germany, no matter where, because we were hoping that maybe from there we will be able to go to Palestine, because that\u2122s was our idea that whatever do \u0152 we do, we don\u2122t wa nt to stay in any other country, except go to Palestine, because we already had bein g in other countries. So that\u2122s what we wanted to do, and the next thing we knew, we came into this, like what they called it later, displaced persons camp. It was called Foehrenwald , which was near Wolfratshausen. It was like about 15 kilometers from Munich. And it\u2122s very interesting because later on I found out that Dachau was near Munich and actually my last transport they were taking us \u0152 we were supposed to get to Dachau . So I said, here I came on my free will, practically \u0152 not to Dachau but Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 30almost, but I came differently. So we spent that time in Foehrenwald. Sam actually got a job, he was working in the office. It was run by the UNRRA. Have you ever heard of UNRRA?"

I used to think if you eat something non-kosher that you di e. So the minute she says we-ell, I said oh-oh. And no sooner did she say it, like everything came out of me, you know, I started throwing up. But of course, little by little I got used to what they fed me, believe me. That didn\u2122t make any difference. So \u0152 but one thing I must say, I am, even to this day, I am not as religious as I used to be. I believe in God. I believe I am \u0152 I like to go to shul, we work for the synagogue, you know, I believe very much in Jewish education for the children and you know, for everybody. I worked at [indecipherable] for \u0152 I was instrumental in raising quite a bit of money for the Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 34Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, because I was always interested in Jewish education. However, I am not as religious or adherent to the kashrut, to being kosher as much as I was then. Because I found out that you can live and it doesn\u2122t have to be everythi ng exactly kosher. And \u0152 and besides, I myself \u0152 had maybe my parents lived thro ugh, I would have kept it on for them, because somehow older people stick much more to it. Even the survivors, the older survivors. But a lot of people like me that went throu gh the war, are not as \u0152 they believe in God, but they don\u2122t believe that the \u0152 the meat has to be slaughtered a certain way in order to be a good Jew or something like this. So no, this they definitely changed me this way. But as far, they couldn\u2122t kill the spark for Judaism and I don\u2122t know why it\u2122s whether because I was so young that it really \u0152 like it, like went above me. I-It didn\u2122t touch me as much. I always say, when you were a young kid, you don\u2122t have the \u0152 the bonds with your family are not yet so complete that you can cope with \u0152 with these thi ng a little bit better than let\u2122s say, older people. I always say that had my sister survived, let\u2122s say you know, my sister actually had a choice, you know , she didn\u2122t have to go with her baby. They actually wanted her to say that this baby isn\u2122t mine. Because you see, they needed her in the \u0152 in the camp. They liked to staff the camp with the doctor, a dentist. By then, when they were taking my sister out, they had killed off most of the doctors and the Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 35dentists and whatnot. So they had to go look for somebo dy. So they actually didn\u2122t want her to leave. They actually encouraged her to say no, this is not my baby. But of course she wouldn\u2122t do it. And you can imagine, if she would survive a-and she had to live with something like this. I mean, you can\u2122t do that. So as far as I was concerned, it\u2122s true I was raised very, you know, in a way you would have been Orthodox, but not to the po int where, like I have some Orthodox neighbors here. You know, they walk around with their hats, and their \u0152 you know, th-they call them the payos in \u0152 in Jewish, I don\u2122t know \u0152"

She knew ma-my mother and she knew my uncle and she called him to New York to say, did you see a niece is looking for you? And he was the one that send me pape rs to come, and my papers were made out not only for me, they were made out whoever is with me, because my uncle figured that if I survived, maybe there was somebody else that survived. But of course, nobody else survived, so I \u0152 I always tell him, you know, when I talk to the kids, they get a bang out of this, I tell them, you know, I tu rned around to my boyfriend, I said, if you marry me, you know you have a ticket to the United States and never \u0152 nobody ever refuses that. And they think that\u2122s very funny, but that wasn\u2122t it, but you know, I had the papers and I was able to bring Sam with me. So Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 41we c-came, actually, from the papers that my uncle sent, but the HIAS really took care of us. They saw to it that we got in line to get to the ship, you know, because it was very terrible that time, you know, they only allowed a certain amount of people.

If you lived in na \u0152 an area like New York, where there were a lot of Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 48survivors, you didn\u2122t have to learn to speak English, because you could get along on Yiddish \u0152 on Jewish, because mo-most of the people that had the little businesses or whatever, you got a job, they were speaking Jewish. And the survivors that you met together, you \u0152 they were speaking Jewish or Polish. So we really didn\u2122t \u0152 they didn\u2122t need it.

And most people, that\u2122s why I always say that the American people are so wonderful, you know, especially in those years. I will tell you i-i \u0152 later on I was thinking to myself how \u0152 you know, my E nglish was so bad and yet they tried so hard. They wouldn\u2122t [indecipherable] from me or anything like that, a-and they tried so hard to like stop and listen to me what I had to tell them or something, you know.

I mean, you \u0152 you can\u2122t put that he \u0152 I hate when people like put me in a \u0152 in a category. I figured I had it already. You know, I went throug h the category. I was Jewish, I was a woman, I wasn\u2122t old enough to go in into \u0152 into the camp, I had to have different papers, my \u0152 I mean, I \u0152 I was already put into so many categories, I didn't like to be. So I wer \u0152 resented her. But because I felt like, if you want to write about your own life, it\u2122s fine. Maybe you have a pr oblem with your mother, or whatever, you\u2122re entitled to it. But don\u2122t say that all the survivors\u2122 kids \u0152 because when you look around, it\u2122s just the oppo site, to the contrary. I think survivors\u2122 kids are very Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 58well adjusted kids. They \u0152 they\u2122ve done wo nders. Or okay, maybe we helped them a little bit, but you can\u2122t help a kid unless they can help themselves. They all \u0152 most of them are professionals, or if they are not, they do something, they\u2122re really very worthwhile citizens. And the way she put in that book \u0152 but this book that she went on this journey, I think she must have come to terms with her mother or whatever, because she went to find from where she came and she found out that her mother wasn\u2122t such a horrible person, and she made that up, that she was, in her mind she assumed that because her mother, you know, maybe didn\u2122t do certain things for her, that she figured all the kids of survivors are no good. So I had a little bit of a problem, but no, I \u0152 as a matter of fact, I would love to get ahold of that book. They \u0152 they had a write-up about this book in one of the \u0152 I think maybe \ufb01Newsweek\ufb02 magazine or in one of them. And I read it, but there wasn\u2122t so much written, but I always wanted to get this book out and read about it, because for the only reason that I wanted to read it, because I wanted to change my mind about this Helen Epstein. So this \u0152 I had my own little beef with her, that I felt like, don\u2122t put all survivors there, just like I\u2122m not going to put that all survivors get a ba \u0152 as a matter of fact, I think the survivors\u2122 kids tried so much harder."

It\u2122s true that we paid a very, very big price, because let\u2122s face it, nobody, nobody gave us a hand or anything. It\u2122s a matter of fact, not only didn\u2122t they give us a hand, they put stumbling blocks, you know, in our way. No \u0152 a \u0152 I told you we were \u0152 we we re rescued by \u0152 by railroad tracks that were broken. They could have done that, the same thing in Auschwitz .

But you know, in \u0152 in Yugoslavia it was a completely different story. People wanted territory.
