In preparation for this interview, I watched the videotape of the interview you conducted with the Holocaust eyewitness project of Washington, D.C. in 1989, and listened to part of the audiotape interview you conducted with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Washington on March 5\u2018 1985. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in those interviews.

This was already 1945, you see, most of the time, to tell you the truth, didn\u2019t know exactly when, what time it was. But later we found out that the war was getting \u2014 was almost of the brink of being finished, except we didn\u2019t realize. But when we stopped at our \u2014 in our train because the railroad tracks were bombed, we couldn\u2019t go \u2014 excuse me \u2014 much farther. So what had happened, while we were waiting there for repairs, the SS had this speech to us, he said hey, you ought to be very happy, because this is April 20\", 1945, it\u2019s Hitler\u2019s birthday. And we, we were thinking why in the hell should we be happy that it\u2019s Hitler\u2019s birthday? But of course he said we will give you an extra piece of bread to celebrate it. And no sooner did he finish as the whole sky became black and we were actually bombed. Our trains were hit by the allies. Not direct, but next to it.

We hid out. We couldn\u2019t stay there too long, because after all, they didn\u2019t give us that extra piece of bread, so we couldn\u2019t do a \u2014 hide out too much, Interview with Regina Spiegel \u00b0 May 11, 1999 and we finally came out and we spotted this Russian \u2014 he was like a \u2014 probably like a colonel in the army. And we ran over to him and he said, don\u2019t worry, you are free. And that\u2019s how we actually were liberated, which was already like not exactly April 20\", because it took us like two days longer. But apparently, the Russians were already there. I always say, had the Germans left us in that camp, we probably would have been liberated by the Americans, because I think where we were liberated was almost very near where the Americans and the Russians met, near the Elbe river."

If we wanted to get some bread \u2014 because we didn\u2019t have like what the Americans did on the American zone, a displaced persons camp where they fed you. With the Interview with Regina Spiegel May 11, 1999 Russians you didn't have anything like this. The only thing what they did for you, we would go to them and say take \u2014 let\u2019s go to a German bakery with us. And they would go with us and they would requisition from the baker, bread for us. So we \u2014 and we, our type of eating was very crude. Bread and water, that\u2019s all we needed, you know, to keep us alive. So that\u2019s what we got, we got mostly bread and water. Because even when we got into a German house, even if we saw some food there, you know, because what was happening after the war, a lot of German households became empty. Why? Because the Germans were afraid of the Russians and they were running towards the American zone. So they left a lot of their homes with no one there. So when we would go in, we would find maybe some food over there. I remember in one place, they had to spe \u2014 these beautiful, you know, like fruits, apples and cherries put in in jars, like we put away sometimes fruits. We were afraid to eat them because we thought that maybe they poisoned it. So we wouldn\u2019t even touch this.

But we were Interview with Regina Spiegel \u00bb May 11, 1999 traveling in this horse and buggy a little bit. During the day, let\u2019s say where we \u2014 if we were in a certain town during the day, we would split up a little bit and go into different places to sleep. Like we would sleep where the horses would sleep in \u2014 in some kind of \u2014 what do they call them, the barns, like. Or the pigs, or some others, because we were actually very much afraid of \u2014 of raping, because during the war, you see, 1-in Germany, I never worried about being raped by a German, because this was something that they were not allowed to do. If\u2014if a German got caught raping a Jewish girl, he was in trouble. So they usually stayed away from us. They probably were raping more German women."

First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very \u2014 from the bombs, she was a little bit more in \u2014 and sh-she \u2014 you know, like she lost a couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us. You know, like I had a little bit of a 1-injury, you know, like a shrapnel? A piece of shrapnel got into my hand, but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I never felt it. You know, it wasn\u2019t dangerous for me. But with her, we had to put her in in a hospital. So she actually stayed in the hospital. We couldn\u2019t, you see, we couldn\u2019t keep on staying in the same town for too long because we were actually afraid of this. So we actually had to leave her in the hospital, but there was another friend that she met that stayed with her. So she was like more or less taken care of. But we kept on going and probably took us probably like about three weeks til we got to the Polish border. And when I got there \u2014 and you know, as you were walking \u2014 you see, when we were liberated, would you believe that most of us didn\u2019t realize that most of our families were murdered? We still were hoping that maybe somebody\u2019s gonna be alive because I Interview with Regina Spiegel \u00bb May 11, 1999 will tell you, in a way maybe that was good, because that\u2019s what kept us through all the other times, kept us going, because if not we probably at one time or another, we would have given up. But that was, in a way, kept us \u2014 hey, you stay alive because you promised that we\u2019re gonna meet at home. You know, like my boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, when they were separate \u2014 when they separated us in Auschwitz he said to me, if we stay alive, just remember, meet me in mine hometown. But also, he didn't know that my mother told me this, when we were, you know, it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said, just remember, if God forbid we should get separated \u2014 you see, never thinking that what\u2019s going to happen, that it\u2019s going to be this mass killing, but just separated. If we go, maybe I was someplace else or something, she says, remember, after the war, we\u2019ll meet in our place, you know, in our home. So naturally, the first thing what I wanted to do is get back home. So I did. That\u2019s how \u2014 and most of us \u2014"

They weren\u2019t maybe bombed as much, because they weren't bombed by the allies, the allies [indecipherable] had lots of bombs. And I dropped \u2014 I will never forget this, I drove \u2014 I \u2014 I didn\u2019t drive, how do you call it? I brought this horse and buggy on the station and left it there just like that because actually, we were 15 girls, no one wanted to go near the horse. I said to them, you went through such a war. You\u2019re afraid of a little horse? I mean, he was that \u2014 he probably w-wa \u2014 I wish all through the war I would have had the dealing with the horse and \u2014 other than with the people.

And I watched, for the first time in my life, I watched the people of Prague, the way they were greeting their president. They were hanging out from their windows and they were \u2014 with such love and I figured, if people can have so much love for their president, that\u2019s how much I knew about \u2014 you know, it somehow \u2014 I always say, with g \u2014 all going through all that war, I still, when I was liberated I was still this Pollyanna, what they used to call me when I was a kid, that I could never see any bad in other people. So here, I looked here at these people greeting the president and I turned around to say, they must be wonderful people. I never knew about Czechoslovakia except what I learned in the history books. I mean, after all, when the war broke out, I was 13 years old, how much did I learn about other countries, you know? But I always was \u2014 loved, you know, geography and history. So I knew a little bit about them, but I didn't know about them, but I didn't know about nature of people. But when I saw them greet like this, I said you know, we should stay here. But you know why we didn\u2019t? We probably wouldn\u2019t mind. Because we heard that you had to be born there in order to become a citizen \u2014 to be a citizen. Otherwise, if you weren\u2019t born there, you never become a citizen. So we were worried. What if it comes in something changes, we\u2019re the first ones to be shipped out like they did in Interview with Regina Spiegel a May 11, 1999 Germany, to a lot of Jews in Germany, because if they weren\u2019t from Germany, they shipped them out. And by then, little by little we found out that the Americans were there. And also they \u2014 we got co \u2014 some people contacted us.

You know here, right, we thought that we did such a act that we were able to smuggle ourselves into the other country so easy, but it \u2014 apparently this was maybe already as a fact. And we were taken from there, we were taken on a bus into Germany."

I used to think if you eat something non-kosher that you die. So the minute she says we-ell, I said oh-oh. And no sooner did she say it, like everything came out of me, you know, I started throwing up. But of course, little by little I got used to what they fed me, believe me. That didn\u2019t make any difference. So \u2014 but one thing I must say, I am, even to this day, I am not as religious as I used to be. I believe in God. I believe I am \u2014 I like to go to shul, we work for the synagogue, you know, I believe very much in Jewish education for the children and you know, for everybody. I worked at [indecipherable] for \u2014 I was instrumental in raising quite a bit of money for the Interview with Regina Spiegel \u201c May 11, 1999 Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, because I was always interested in Jewish education. However, I am not as religious or adherent to the kashrut, to being kosher as much as I was then. Because I found out that you can live and it doesn\u2019t have to be everything exactly kosher. And \u2014 and besides, I myself \u2014 had maybe my parents lived through, I would have kept it on for them, because somehow older people stick much more to it. Even the survivors, the older survivors. But a lot of people like me that went through the war, are not as \u2014 they believe in God, but they don\u2019t believe that the \u2014 the meat has to be slaughtered a certain way in order to be a good Jew or something like this. So no, this they definitely changed me this way. But as far, they couldn\u2019t kill the spark for Judaism and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s whether because I was so young that it really \u2014 like it, like went above me. I-It didn\u2019t touch me as much. I always say, when you were a young kid, you don\u2019t have the \u2014 the bonds with your family are not yet so complete that you can cope with \u2014 with these thing a little bit better than let\u2019s say, older people. I always say that had my sister survived, let\u2019s say you know, my sister actually had a choice, you know, she didn\u2019t have to go with her baby. They actually wanted her to say that this baby isn\u2019t mine. Because you see, they needed her in the \u2014 in the camp. They liked to staff the camp with the doctor, a dentist. By then, when they were taking my sister out, they had killed off most of the doctors and the Interview with Regina Spiegel \u00bb May 11, 1999 dentists and whatnot. So they had to go look for somebody. So they actually didn\u2019t want her to leave. They actually encouraged her to say no, this is not my baby. But of course she wouldn\u2019t do it. And you can imagine, if she would survive a-and she had to live with something like this. I mean, you can\u2019t do that. So as far as I was concerned, it\u2019s true I was raised very, you know, in a way you would have been Orthodox, but not to the point where, like I have some Orthodox neighbors here. You know, they walk around with their hats, and their \u2014 you know, th-they call them the payos in \u2014 in Jewish, I don\u2019t know \u2014"

So when I came to Washington, I already knew how to use an electric sewing machine, so I knew, so I actually got a job right away at that place here, and then I switched to another place and I worked til my daughter was almost born.

I mean, you \u2014 you can\u2019t put that he \u2014 I hate when people like put me in a \u2014 in a category. I figured I had it already. You know, I went through the category. I was Jewish, I was a woman, I wasn\u2019t old enough to go in into \u2014 into the camp, I had to have different papers, my \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 I was already put into so many categories, I didn't like to be. So I wer \u2014 resented her. But because I felt like, if you want to write about your own life, it\u2019s fine. Maybe you have a problem with your mother, or whatever, you\u2019re entitled to it. But don\u2019t say that all the survivors\u2019 kids \u2014 because when you look around, it\u2019s just the opposite, to the contrary. I think survivors\u2019 kids are very Interview with Regina Spiegel * May 11, 1999 well adjusted kids. They \u2014 they\u2019ve done wonders. Or okay, maybe we helped them a little bit, but you can\u2019t help a kid unless they can help themselves. They all \u2014 most of them are professionals, or if they are not, they do something, they\u2019re really very worthwhile citizens. And the way she put in that book \u2014 but this book that she went on this journey, I think she must have come to terms with her mother or whatever, because she went to find from where she came and she found out that her mother wasn\u2019t such a horrible person, and she made that up, that she was, in her mind she assumed that because her mother, you know, maybe didn\u2019t do certain things for her, that she figured all the kids of survivors are no good. So I had a little bit of a problem, but no, I \u2014 as a matter of fact, I would love to get ahold of that book. They \u2014 they had a write-up about this book in one of the \u2014 I think maybe \u201cNewsweek\u201d magazine or in one of them. And I read it, but there wasn\u2019t so much written, but I always wanted to get this book out and read about it, because for the only reason that I wanted to read it, because I wanted to change my mind about this Helen Epstein. So this \u2014 I had my own little beef with her, that I felt like, don\u2019t put all survivors there, just like I\u2019m not going to put that all survivors get a ba \u2014 as a matter of fact, I think the survivors\u2019 kids tried so much harder."

It\u2019s true that we paid a very, very big price, because let\u2019s face it, nobody, nobody gave us a hand or anything. It\u2019s a matter of fact, not only didn\u2019t they give us a hand, they put stumbling blocks, you know, in our way. No \u2014 a-\u2014I told you we were \u2014 we were rescued by \u2014 by railroad tracks that were broken. They could have done that, the same thing in Auschwitz.

But you know, in \u2014 in Yugoslavia it was a completely different story. People wanted territory.
