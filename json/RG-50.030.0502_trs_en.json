My mother was a suffragist, and he wrote a screenplay, a three-reel called \u201cWhat Every Woman Wants\u201d \u2014 I think it was called. And he got $500 for that script, which was quite a lot for those days. And he told me it was that 500 that he paid the doctor, Dr. Jellyhouse \u2014 I\u2019ve always loved that name \u2014 who delivered me, at home, and so I really owe my birth to film writing, you might say.

                " (Take us from New York to California.) We left when I was about six years old. And my father had been working for Adolf Zukor, Famous Players, as a writer and publicist, from about the age of 18 \u2014 he started very, very young. But by the time I was born, he decided he would like to branch out on his own. And become his own film company producer. So we went out to Hollywood very early. I really remember the ride on that train. It was on the old Chief, Santa Fe Chief, before the Superchief, even. And I vaguely remember that, being out on the observation car, and watching the country fall away behind us. My father and Louis Mayer, later the famous third \u201cM\u201d at MGM -\u2014 the two of them together set up a very early film studio, way downtown, not in what we call Hollywood now, but down by the railroad tracks, way downtown Los Angeles. It was called the Mayer-Schulberg studio. So both Mayer and BP, so they both were making these early silent films. That\u2019s about it. My father\u2019s big discovery was Clara Bow. He found her in a Brooklyn beauty contest, actually, signed her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her to Hollywood. I called Clara sort of a pre- Marilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen. She was known as the, as the \u201cIt\u201d girl, from a famous novel of the time, and movie called \u201cIt.\u201d And she had it. Clara really did have It. She really did. She\u2019s still amazing to watch in those silent films. And that\u2019s so \u2014 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection My father and Louis made their films for a few years, for about three or four years, and then Louis Mayer went to the newly formed MGM. And at that point my father went over, went back to Zukor, in a sense, and became head of the, of the west coast studio of Paramount. And so, all through my young manhood, growing up, I really grew up on the, in a way, on the backlot. I used to go there almost every day on my bike, drove through those famous gates, and roam around and play on the backlot sets, and wander into different stages where they were shooting amazing films. So all these famous stars were like old hat to us \u2014 they were more like people who just worked for my father \u2014 was the way we thought of them. "

                " (How early did you get interested in writing?) Very, very early, I\u2019d say I was about 9 or 10, very early. It was very much a part of our household atmosphere. My father had started as a writer, with the, with those early photoplays. And he, also as a kid, worked on the old Daily Mail and a short time on the old World \u2014 papers that we, that we dearly miss. There used to be about ten daily papers, and now we\u2019re down to about two and a half. So, so he, he had a great interest in, aside from film, in uh writing. And my mother was a frustrated librarian. And she set up a very big library, thousands of books, all set up like a regular library, all numbered like a library, a real library. My father used to \u2014 Sunday morning was a ritual. He would read from the classics, aloud to us, Sunday mornings until brunch, from about 9:30 or so. It\u2019s amazing what we read. We read through Dickens and Melville and Galsworthy, and we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years and years, we heard that. So writing was very much part of our life. So I started when I was about 9 or 10, started to write little stories, very much encouraged by my parents. So by the time I went to high school, I just thought of myself as a writer, as if it was already my profession. And it all went \u2014 it fell in place very naturally. I edited the high school \u2014 Los Angeles High School daily paper. We had a daily paper. I laugh because these days, my kids at Westhampton High School couldn\u2019t get out a monthly paper, and the thought of a daily paper, they couldn\u2019t imagine putting it out every day. But we did. So anyway, that\u2019s why, so we breathed that atmosphere. My sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when she was about 19, that Scribners published, entitled, They Cried a Little. Sonya said that in our house, where in other homes they might have a piano and people might sit down \u2014 Sonya said, in our house, we had a typewriter, and as we passed we might type out a little jingle or something or a little story, and we all, Sonya and Stuart, Stuart wrote very well, too.

If we had a little contest, describing some Hollywood street. She can still do that better than I can; she\u2019s very, very sharp. The difference was that I made, I made much more of a job of it, an everyday job. And Sonya is so finicky that nothing ever satisfies her. She\u2019|l take a short story and work on it for a year, and still not want to show it to anyone. She\u2019s a perfectionist. But in the real life of writing you can\u2019t do that.

Why don\u2019t you tell us about that period and give us a sense of Hollywood when the war started.). Well, 19 \u2014, let\u2019s see. When I got out of college in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my father\u2019s assistant, had now set up his own studio, and was planning independent films, one of which of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born \u2014 which was the daddy of all those later Star is Borns. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And, let\u2019s see, I came back and started working for David as a young screenwriter. And I had a seven-year contract \u2014 it started at 50 and went to 75 a week. At the end of seven years, I would have been making $500. And, uh, but he, but even, a year and a half into it, I would write screenplays that David, I don\u2019t think ever read; he was so busy making the films he was already planning. And then they would call us in \u2014I thought of it as being a, sort of like being a pinch hitter who comes in off the bench. If there was some immediate problem, David would call Ring Lardner and me \u2014 we were a writing team. We were both about 21, 22 years old. We were just out of college. And he would call us in on \u2014like on A Star is Born. They couldn\u2019t figure out the ending of A Star is Born, and we wrote the ending of it, that one where Janet comes out of Grauman\u2019s Chinese and sees her husband\u2019s footprints and handprints, and when she\u2019s asked her name. She\u2019s now a big movie star, and he\u2019s gone down, and in fact he committed suicide because he couldn\u2019t stand his failure while she\u2019s gone up. And she looks down, and when they ask her on the radio, she says, \u201cThis is Mrs. Norman Maine.\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s a big ending in the movie. Things like that, little bits and pieces. It wasn\u2019t awfully satisfying. By the time he was about to pick up my third option, I went in to David and I asked David \u2014 I\u2019d known him so well for years and years \u2014 my mother even put him, my mother really stage managed his wedding to Irene Mayer, my mother really sort of put them together, encouraged them. And I\u2019d known him since I was a kid, and I said, \u201cDavid, do me a big favor, please, don\u2019t pick up my option.\u201d And David was really very hurt. He said \u2014 he felt really insulted, and he said, \u201cWell, I have great plans for you. I was thinking that as I get older, I may retire, and you might be ready to take over for me, and then my young son Danny, Danny would work for you the way you work....\u201d You could see this going on until the 21\u201c century \u2014 a dynasty of the Selznicks and the Schulbergs. And I said, \u201cWell, I appreciate that, David, I really want to be a writer, and not really a big producer, like you.\u201d And David said, he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201c I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer\u201d \u2014 and that hurt my feelings a little bit, but that\u2019s exactly what he said \u2014 he said, \u201cI know we carry you on the payroll as a writer, but,\u201d he said, \u201cI figure that sooner or later your producer\u2019s blood would begin to assert itself and that would kick in.\u201d I told Scott Fitzgerald that anecdote, and he used it in The Last Tycoon. It\u2019s in The Last Tycoon. So anyway, to cut this a little shorter, I finally did get out of there. I started writing short stories for Liberty and Colliers and for all the slick magazines. And I was doing very well with that. And one of the short stories was What Makes Sammy Run? And I then decided that I'd like to put, work out there and try to develop that as a novel. And that, that caused me quite a bit of trouble. Because for one thing, I was, I was, I was a young member of the Communist Party (drinks) \u2014 (PAUSE) "

It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection We met secretly every week, once a week, and we all had lots of assignments. We were very busy infiltrating different organizations, the Screenwriters\u2019 Guild and the Anti-Nazi League \u2014 all kinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young Democrats, and we would try to infiltrate them, to influence them toward the communist program. So I asked at the meeting if I could be excused from my regular assignments in order to \u2014 I'd like to stop and write this book. The answer was, \u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to talk to Jack Lawson about that\u201d \u2014 Lawson was the head of the communist party \u2014 \u201cto decide whether the book would be valuable enough to the party to justify your dropping your assignments.\u201d So I went to see Lawson, and Lawson was, was very tough, really tough and hardnosed. And Jack said, \u201cWell, Budd, I think the only way we can handle this is that you make an outline of the book, show me the outline, and then if I think the book will be useful to the party, then I'll sort of supervise the writing of the book.\u201d And I said, \u201cJesus, Jack, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d And Jack started to give me things about the responsibility to the party. And that went on for many, many weeks, and I refused to do it. And they said, \u201cNo, you have to do it, or if you....\u201d Finally, one day I went home with my young wife, Jigee, and I said, \u201cJigee, I can\u2019t take the argument any more. It\u2019s just eating me up, and so what I want to do is get in the car and drive away and just leave. And even that was, even that \u2014 people don\u2019t realize how tightly disciplined the party was. You couldn\u2019t just get in a car and drive away. If you were going to New York you had to tell them where you were going. And then if you were staying more than two or three weeks, you were reassigned to a unit in New York. It was very tightly controlled. So I just \u2014 the very act of getting in a car and driving away was a very serious defiance of the party discipline. And when I got back to, I went back to Dartmouth, where I\u2019d gone to college, and found a little house, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a month, it was. And for the next year I worked on this book, Sammy. Meanwhile, while I was there, the Soviet-Nazi pact came down, and that drove me even further from the party, because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler, and suddenly, suddenly the party people were saying that it\u2019s just an imperialist war between the Germans and the English. And we should be neutral and stuff, which I thought was a grave mistake, also. Also, and so I was even further alienated from the party. And I got the book done and, and went back and, uh, the top people like Lawson were mad, were very mad at me for going and doing this on my own. But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the People\u2019s World, which was the western edition of the Daily Worker, Charles Glenn was his name \u2014 he wrote a rave review of the book. He thought the book was the Hollywood book, if not maybe the great American novel that everyone was talking about \u2014 raved about it. That caused a firestorm apparently. They called him in and they gave him hell \u2014 Lawson and company. Two weeks later he re-reviewed the book and he said, \u201cOn further consideration\u201d \u2014 and he even said, \u201cIt\u2019s been pointed out to me the shortcomings,\u201d and he absolutely trashed the book. Apparently they had threatened him that if he didn\u2019t, if he didn\u2019t do that he would be fired from the paper and maybe even kicked out of the party. He had to do it, and so he just trashed This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

                " (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced with testifying?) Yeah. The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn fired me. He was just ina rage. When I came in, he screamed at me. It was almost like that Judge Freisler. And he screamed at me. \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor! You\u2019re a traitor!\u201d Like that, he got purple, he was so mad. \u201cHow could you write that terrible book?!\u201d he screamed at me. And then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that \u2014 my father of course was a member and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father. He took off the same way, and he said, \u201cB.P. I blame you for this. You should have stopped him. It\u2019s your fault.\u201d He was yelling, too. You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing. My father said, \u201cLouis, I did try to stop him. I wrote him a letter begging him not to publish the book.\u201d I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me. \u201cIf you publish this book, it will ruin you. You'll never be able to live. You\u2019ll never get a job here again. And not only that, it will hurt me, it will hurt your mother \u2014 who was just entering the agency \u2014 it will hurt the whole family. You\u2019ve got to put \u2014 don\u2019t publish the book.\u201d My father wrote that. Anyway, Louis Mayer said \u2014 he said, \u201cYou know what I think we should do with him?\u201d He said, \u201cT think we should deport him.\u201d And he really meant it. It was really sort of fascinating, because I always said that Hollywood in those days was like its own country. They thought of it as their own country. It was like Luxembourg or something. They ran that country. And they could do anything they wanted. The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name. He was on a weekly salary. They paid him every week. And they could do anything. They could cover up any crime. It never got in the paper. Clark Gable drunkenly killed somebody. He did. And no one every heard about it. Nothing. Because they ran everything, including the press. It was really their country. So when Mayer said that \u2014 it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be deported. And my father \u2014 I always said my father was much more intelligent than Louis, he knew so much more, but he wasn\u2019t as smart in a practical way as Louis was. And my father said, \u201cLouis,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe you\u2019re right, but,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere do you think his St. Helena should be?\u201d He said, \u201cMaybe we should deport him to Catalina Island.\u201d And according to my father, some of the producers laughed, but Louis didn\u2019t think that was a bit funny. So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by both the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both. It was from both extremes. So I went back to New York, and \u2014 of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast. And then, from then on, which pretty much I\u2019ve done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth, which I\u2019ve tried to do. "

And uh, and then, then I was working on my, I was back in Vermont. I was starting my second book. And then came Pearl Harbor, and we were in the war. And then I, I was anxious to get in the war, and I, uh, I applied to the Marine Corps. Uh, and then I, I went back to Hollywood to see my daughter and Jigee, and at that time, I spoke to the, John Ford, the famous movie director. Ford was forming this outfit, the \u2014 called the Navy OSS Photographic Unit that would work with the, in the OSS with, with photographic in- intelligence. And because of my book\u2019s success, uh, Ford asked, Ford asked me, he said he would like me to be in that unit. So that\u2019s what happened. I then applied, with his recommendation. And that took about six months before I was approved. And in the meantime, I went down to Mexico and waited in Mexico and wrote screenplays to support myself, wrote screenplays down there, for Mexican producers. And then finally I was, I got my Navy commission and went to Washington to report to John Ford. And that was the beginning of my war experience. I was in, in for about four years, because after the war, I was with the Nuremberg Trial. It seems to me, I think it was from spring of \u201842 to spring of *46 before I got, before I got out, because the last six or seven months was spent preparing a film for the Nuremberg, the photographic evidence for the trial.

John Ford, of course he was a genius, but he had a, I think he had a kind of sadistic trait. Because when I came in to report \u2014 I\u2019d known him in Hollywood, and I was still thinking of him as a movie director and me as a young writer. So I walked in and said, \u201cHi Jack, I\u2019m here, like, what do you want me to do?\u201d It was sort of like that. And Ford was now a Navy Commander, and he said, \u201cEnsign Schulberg, that\u2019s no way to report to your commander. Come to attention and salute and make an official report.\u201d And so on. I thought the guy was crazy, but I said, \u201cEnsign Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.\u201d And he\u2019s said, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d So he\u2019s like a standard stiff-necked Navy commander. It was so typical Ford, so I say, OK, if that\u2019s what he wants, I'll do it. I don\u2019t care. So the next time I come into his office I give him a sal...and say, \u201cEnsign Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.\u201d John Ford says to me, \u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake, Budd, you don\u2019t have to go through all that. Sit down. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d Like now he\u2019s just a movie director again. That\u2019s the way he was. He loved to keep people off balance. That was a big thing with Ford, to keep them off balance. Whatever you thought he was going to say, he\u2019d say something different. But he took glee in, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to send you to Fort Schuyler, and they\u2019 Il really knock some Navy discipline into you.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to find it very tough.\u201d He couldn\u2019t wait for me to suffer there, at Fort Schuyler. And so I went to Schuyler \u2014 I didn\u2019t mind it really, I found it rather interesting. Tough, but \u2014 and we\u2019d run around the Fort at 6 o\u2019clock in the morning and go all through this stuff, and so it was sort of interesting. And one really funny thing happened there. There were two little ensigns from the South. One was named Watts and the other was named Furr. One came from Mississippi and the other from Georgia. And they would always stare at me. I\u2019d be doing something and they\u2019d look up and they were staring at me. And one night after mess, I came back to my bunk, and they came over, and they said, \u201cExcuse me, Schulberg, would you mind if we talk to you?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, no.\u201d So they sat down This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then they, and then we got to chatting a bit. And then they \u2014 they were very polite. He said, \u201cWell, Sir, if you don\u2019t mind our asking,\u201d Furr said, \u201cWhat do you do in civilian life?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m a writer.\u201d And Furr said, \u201cA writer.

You know William Faulkner?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell sure, I see him every morning.\u201d He said, \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d He had no idea that he was famous. He just thought he was a crazy guy in town. They had no idea he was a famous writer. They were so funny. They used to... After that, they would, whenever they saw me \u2014 I should write about them some time \u2014 they would \u2014(Drinks) Umm, whenever they saw me, they would say, \u201cHi, Schulberg,\u201d and then they\u2019d look at each other, be sort of pleased. It was like that, I mean, it was just a, I was just a bizarre thing to them. I didn\u2019t feel really anti-Semitism, it was just, simply, they had never seen one, that\u2019s all. ---------------(?) or something. It was so... And the final exam - it was just murder. You, you had to chart the, chart the passage of a ship, and you get all these instructions, thirty knots at this and then left to here and right to there, trying to take it from this one place all the way through the canal, to docking. And I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was doing. I was sweating. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to flunk this thing, Ford is going to kill me.\u201d I couldn\u2019t do it. I swear to God, as I\u2019m sweating this out, Furr and Watts are sitting right across the aisle from me, and I see a hand coming in surreptitiously, and he shows me his paper so I could copy it and pass. They saved me. They saved me \u2014 Furr and Watts. God, they were sort of lovable, really. I\u2019m sure when they went home, big stories about how they met this Jew.

I\u2019ve been there for three months or something. And I\u2019m very snapped up.

I worked on films like that, which was more or less like working in Hollywood. And, then he sent me overseas to London. I was there in the blitz, and we did some, some undercover work in, in London, and then Paris. And then we had some really interesting assignments. One was not really involved in photography. We were part of a little group that, as soon as a German town fell, we would rush in and try to grab as much information \u2014 we would go to the SS headquarters and things like that and grab papers and orders and things like that.

They had writers like me work with, on the team that would drop, drop agents behind the line. And each agent had about, a team of about eight that took care of them. They all had different assignments. One would just \u2014 took care of his general welfare. And, and one was involved in the aviation problems, when he could be dropped, the weather, and where, and stuff like that. And I as a writer would work on their cover story, which was very much like writing a story. It was exactly like writing a character in fiction, because you would find out what they really did, and then just adjust it to what they would say when they got, if they were interrogated. And so that was really interesting. Right before the end of the war, we had one, one guy who was a Danish agent. I was just amazed at the, at the crazy courage of these people. And he\u2019d become quite famous. He had been actually dropped in Berlin or something, or got to Berlin. He went to the Adlon Hotel, and became a big pal of some big SS general. He was posing as a, as a neutral salesman of some kind \u2014 I forget what the hell they thought he was selling \u2014 but he became a pal and drinking buddy, and so -. Now it was quite near the end of the war, and his main worry was that the war might end before he could do 50 drops. He really was worried that the war would be over.

What he did, and where it got mixed up is that, apparently Stevens, at the end of the war got a film unit and went around photographing the concentration camps, and made several films that were, I think, quite effective. But of course that was not involved at all in the Nuremberg Trial. For one thing, as I mentioned last night, we could only use film that the Germans themselves had shot and prepared, so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be admissible evidence. But we never saw George Stevens. And I don\u2019t think Ill ever be able to disconnect it. It comes up constantly. It\u2019s right there, if you find it\u2014 George Stevens worked on this.

Why don\u2019t you tell us, give us some detail about how it came about, your suggestion about photographic evidence, and when you first came to Nuremberg, too, if you can go on to that.) At the end of the war, after the war was, was over, General Bill Donovan was very interested 1n, was one of the first, I think, to be strongly in favor of an international tribunal to try the major war criminals. And he, he called a meeting \u2014 I need some water, too, cause my mouth gets dry from talking so much. (Drinks) He called a meeting of, of all the various OSS departments to discuss how the OSS could contribute to the building of an international trial. And again, Ray Kellogg, maybe Ford, but I worked much more closely with Kellogg than I did with Ford \u2014 Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford might make suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but Kellogg was my immediate superior. So I guess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking about the importance of the impending trial. And he felt that the OSS was logically set up to make a major contribution to their intelligence work and all the rest of it. I got the feeling at the meeting that, that I think Donovan saw himself as the main, would be the main U.S. prosecutor. I think he really hoped to have the job that eventually went to Justice Robert Jackson. Anyway, each one spoke up about what they could do, and naturally, coming from the Film OSS Photographic \u2014 it was only logical to say that maybe there was photographic evidence that we could use at, at a trial. As aresult of that meeting, Kellogg then put me in, in charge of a photographic team that would look, search for and gather and edit and present the photographic evidence at the trial. And so, so I ... Then I went back to Berlin, and, where, where the OSS was headquartered, and, and \u2014 with my brother Stuart, to be in charge of the still photographic evidence. So, he set up in, I think in Wiesbaden. And Stuart got the, the cooperation of Hans Hoffmann, who was Hitler\u2019s official photographer. And Hoffmann, who \u2014 oddly enough, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von Schirach, the, who was on trial, the head of the Hitlerjugend. It was really ironic because in a sense the father in law was helping to hang his son in law. But as I point out \u2014 with all the Germans that we worked with they, once we won, they would do anything we wanted, that they were completely submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a slavish point. I mean, I was sort of disgusted with it, ina way. We would say that the \u2014 feeling anti-German at that time, because we did feel that the country really overwhelmingly had supported Hitler.

And at that point, we found them willing \u2014 that even formerly Nazi people would do anything that you, anything that you wanted, because they were scared of us also.

It\u2019s sort of a long story, Raye, but I went to the head of the Russian archives, this unusual man, uh, Major Avenerius he was, and I told him what we were looking for, and as I said last night, he, he asked me, well, he said, \u201cDid you come up from the John Ford unit?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and he said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s very interesting.\u201d And it turned out that he was a John Ford scholar.

He knew every damned shot. It turned out he was a... He was like really basically a civilian, and he\u2019d been a professor at the film institute in Moscow, and John Ford was his favorite of all world directors. John Ford was his favorite director. He knew everything about Ford. And he found it very interesting that Ford was the commander of the outfit. And he asked me if Ford would be coming, and I said \u201cWell, yes he might come, just to inspect what we\u2019re doing.\u201d And he said, \u201cWould you introduce me to him?\u201d All his life he\u2019d wanted to meet John Ford. I said, \u201cWell, sure, if he comes. I think he may come.\u201d And with that, that opened the door. He told me to come back in the morning. And he opened up to us only, German, not all but a lot of the German newsreel film that they had shot themselves, and that we, a great deal of that record, the whole record of the growth of the Nazis and their coming to power officially through that strange uh, actually through an election, and all the rest of it.

I should backtrack. My two, my two SS film editors \u2014 we had recruited them from a POW camp \u2014 Walter Rothe and Curt von Molo were their names - and they told us that there were films made of, actually showing the Jews being shoved into cattle cars and ripped of their rings and jewelry and, and various atrocious things that the SS were doing to these poor Jewish victims. And, they had both worked on those, edited those films, and had shown them to Goebbels and Himmler, and obscenely, they called them \u2018desserts,\u2019 because they would be shown after dinner like a dessert in a\u2014I guess as an amusement, partly an amusement but partly it was supposed to be reporting. These were like SS reports on what they were accomplishing. And they told us that there were a great many of these films. And the Russians said that they might be in this place, where they\u2019d been sort of sealed up in a tunnel. And they did take us there, and it was on fire. It was burning. It was almost, it, it was, God, it looked like acres of film were burning. We did pick up little pieces. And then they told us about two, two places in the sector, one called Rossleben and, and Rudersdorf \u2014 two small towns where the same thing. They would apparently make a tunnel into a mountainside or a hillside, and then seal up this film. And they were hiding it. And, and so we drove to both places. And in both places, of course, Rossleben and Rudersdorf, we found the same thing that we had found in the Russian sector. The film was burning, or had been burned \u2014 acres of it. It was huge. And once again, we were cheated out of getting what would have been just invaluable stuff.

Goering was by far the smartest of all the people on trial. I remember the day at our hotel, when the captain psychiatrist came rushing in, all excited. He\u2019d been testing the IQs of the various defendants. And he said, \u201cMy God, that Goering he acts like a clown.

He acted like, as a defendant was who feels that he has a chance of being found not guilty. I don\u2019t know if he really thought so, but that\u2019s the way he acted, and that was his demeanor most of the time in the courtroom. He would take notes, and he would consult with his attorney, and so forth, and he took it very seriously. Some just sat like, as if they were staring. Streicher had a funny look on his face.

Jodl [sic] very clearly, very clearly were saying, were disassociating, their attitude was, we shouldn\u2019t be here, and we have nothing to do with this.

Well, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us. [Sound problem \u2014 Boom mike was missing. | Well, the \u2014 of all the Nazi propaganda films that, many were made, by far the most, by far the most illustrious, or you might say notorious, of the Germans was Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s master film of the Nazi party day \u2014 I think it was the seventh \u2014 called the Triumph of the Will. It was shot in a way that you could see obviously idolized and made heroes of the people, by shooting at a low angle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, a sense of really ex-, ex-, exalting them. The film, which was about a three-hour, very long documentary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of work. It was overwhelming. The, the idea that Goebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that could be shown, it was not only for German consumption. It was shown all over Europe. And I think that it definitely made a contribution to the capitulation of the western democracies, capitulating to Hitler, letting him make one act of aggression after another, in the Rhineland, and the Sudetenland, and on and on they went, one little step at a time. And the feeling was that, looking at that film, that it would make the non-German countries and their leaders say, \u201cHow can we possibly defeat that power?\u201d It was overwhelming, just overwhelming. I think 1t was General Donovan who said that the Triumph of the Will was worth two Wehrmacht divisions. It was a powerful piece of propaganda. And so, it was, it didn\u2019t take any genius to think that we ought to talk to Leni Riefenstahl. She not only made that one masterwork, but she made a number of small Parteitag films or reports. She was very closely tied in with the whole Nazi propaganda machine. And so it was obvious that we would want to, to speak with her and, and examine her, and bring her to Nuremberg. And so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in Berlin, and they directed to me to some place in Strasbourg. And I went there, and then I went to Kitzbihl. And one by one, I got closer and closer to finding out where she actually was living \u2014 sort of hiding in the open, in a way. It wasn\u2019t exactly hiding but she wasn\u2019t advertising either, what her address was. And so I was able to actually, with a weapons carrier and an army driver, I was able to go to her house and literally just knock on the door. She was living in a very nice place \u2014 it was a big, big, rustic \u2014 it looked like three stories \u2014 a very, quite large \u2014 on a, overlooking a Bavarian lake. It was a very nice place. So that\u2019s what I did. I just knocked on the door and somebody came to the door. And I was in my Navy uniform, of course. And I said, \u201cI would like to speak to Miss Riefenstahl.\u201d And they let me in. It was a little man, said he would call her. So I sat down, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I waited. It took a very long time for her to come. I think it was almost half an hour, maybe. She took a very long time coming. I think she was making up. After all, she was a movie star as well as a filmmaker \u2014 big star in Germany \u2014all these famous ice movies that she made, and mountain movies. And she finally came, and I sat with her on a couch. And she started right away working on me. She said, of course, \u201cI\u2019m a film artist, and internationally respected.\u201d And she gave a very positive rundown on herself. And she said, \u201cI\u2019m respected everywhere in London, in Hollywood, and so forth, and I\u2019m not a Nazi, I\u2019m a pure film artist.\u201d That was her own party line and, boy, she stuck to it pretty well, too. And, and when she told me how well received she was in Hollywood, of course that was my hometown. She didn\u2019t know that I came from Hollywood. She just saw a young, an American officer who was trying to do her in. And she told me that, after all, even in 1938 everyone in Hollywood received her as a pure filmmaker and fellow artist. And I didn\u2019t tell her that I was in Hollywood when she came. Hal Roach was an extremely rightwing \u2014 the old comedy producer/director Hal Roach gave a party for her, a big reception party, and asked all the main people in Hollywood to come. And all of the liberal people like Melvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan and Dorothy Parker and so many, Freddy March \u2014 a whole bunch, there must have been twenty \u2014 they were each given a list of ten people to phone and say, \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d I had a list myself. And the party was a fiasco. Only about eight or ten people \u2014 just the extreme right wing people like Victor McLaglen, people like that \u2014 only the fascist minded people, of which there were unpleasantly some in Hollywood. It was a total fiasco. Basically, the party was a disaster for her. But I didn\u2019t tell her that. I just listened and listened. But as I said last night, I had this warrant for her in my pocket. It was like burning a hole in my pocket. I thought, I would just let her talk a little longer, so I relaxed her. I didn\u2019t argue with her at all about what she thought she was. Finally I took the thing out and said, \u201cMiss Riefenstahl, I\u2019m sorry, but I have to take you to Nuremberg.\u201d And that\u2019s when she screamed \u201cPuppi, Puppi, they\u2019re, he\u2019s arresting me,\u201d she screamed. \u201cHe\u2019s arresting me.\u201d And he ran in. I didn\u2019t know at the time, he was a major in the Wehrmacht. And I told her, I tried to reassure her, I said, \u201cLook, you\u2019re not being put on trial with Goering and von Ribbentrop, but we do need you as a material witness, and you\u2019ll be held, youll be put up in one of the hotels, and held until the court releases you.\u201d And so out we went. We went in \u2014I wish I had a photo of that \u2014 because sitting outside was a weapons carrier, like an open truck almost. It was just the three of us, and we drove from there, from Kitzbuhl, all the way to Nuremberg. She didn\u2019t say anything on the way. She was just silent. She didn\u2019t say anything. She was very ticked off \u2014 very. And I guess scared. "

Well, Walter Rothe was, had been a Fox Movietone film editor, he was a newsreel editor. Curt von Molo had been a feature film, film editor. He told me that he had worked with Fritz Lang and with some of the top German directors, and he seemed very, he seemed quite intelligent. And the two of them, instead of being two Nazi POWs that might have managed sympathy for each other, the two of them couldn\u2019t stand each other. They didn\u2019t like each other. And each, both of them told me \u2014 \u201cI was recruited into the SS film unit but I was, I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I had to or else.\u201d Each one said the same thing, \u201cI was really anti Nazi.\u201d Each one said about the other guy: \u201cWalter Rothe really was a Nazi. He was very sympathetic.\u201d And Rothe said the same thing about von Molo. He was anti Nazi but von Molo was pro-SS and wanted to get in that SS film unit. They both said that. They had no use for each other at all. I really didn\u2019t know which of them was right. Also, Curt von Molo told me that all through the war, while he was working for the SS, that a Jewish film editor had been hiding in his attic, like in his house. And I took that with a grain of salt, because it was a joke to us. But from the first crossing over into Germany, we didn\u2019t meet a German who didn\u2019t have a Jew in the attic. How could there be six million Jews in the concentration camps, because they must have all been up in the attics. Everybody we met, almost without fail, would say, \u201cI was against Hitler and I saved a Jew in my attic.\u201d It got to be a joke with us. And von Molo said the same thing. He had this Jewish editor, and he said it was very precarious because he did work on these horrible SS films, at the same time. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

One Sunday, we \u2014 we would tend to try to rest on Sunday. We were, everybody was really wiped out by this work. One Sunday, I said to von Molo, \u201cLook, Curt, I\u2019m really sick of hearing about these Jews in the attic, I\u2019ve had it up to here with it, and I\u2019ve got to tell you I don\u2019t believe it, and he said, \u201cWell, honestly, I\u2019m telling you the truth. It was that fellow, a friend of mine, that I worked with in the studio, you know, UFA.\u201d And I said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s Sunday morning. Let\u2019s take the day off. We\u2019ll take a jeep, and you and I and a driver, we\u2019ll just drive around the whole day in Berlin.\u201d Because, that\u2019s right, he said, \u201cSomeone told me that he survived and that he\u2019s back. Someone said they saw him in Berlin, just a few days ago, and thank God, apparently he\u2019s alive.\u201d So I said, \u201cCurt, let\u2019s take the day off. And we\u2019re going to look for this Jew in the attic.\u201d And we did. So we start out, and he noticed some girl in Nuremberg, and we go there and we find her \u2014 it was incredible we could find anybody, with how they were living \u2014 the place was a total disaster \u2014 people were living 1n holes and doorways and Christ knows, anyway this first girl says, \u201cI heard that too.\u201d And I (referenced?) this person, we went to see him, it was amazing we\u2019d find anybody but there was still, even with everything down, there was a kind of amazing word of mouth. People seemed to know where other people were. And to cut this short \u2014 after a few hours of going from one (street?) to another, and finally to his actual, we found his own girlfriend, who had survived the war. She lived all the way through the war in Berlin. And she said, \u201cYes, he is, he\u2019s definitely here.\u201d And she told us where she thought he was. And we went there. And here comes this little Jewish guy, he was still in his concentration camp stripes and still \u2014 he out, and he sees Curt, he hugs Curt, and he says to me, \u201cThis man saved my life. I actually lived in his attic.\u201d And we finally found a real Jew in the attic. And apparently Curt was telling the truth the whole time. And from that time on, I became very, now I believed, now I knew that Curt was for real and that he really, he told me that Fritz Lang left, and he tried to leave, and got stopped, or something. He wasn\u2019t able to leave. He was hoping to leave, too. Now I believed him. Now I thought that Walter Rothe was a Nazi rat. But it really was an unbelievable story. "

The reaction I got was more, asking people, there\u2019d be kind of a sullen \u2014 some, they were worried.

They were like Just like the Jew in the attic \u2014 the reverse of that was no one to have heard of a concentration camp. I went to Dachau. It must have been two miles outside of Dachau, and I got lost, and I asked the way to the Dachau concentration camp. And this was two miles away. They had never heard of it.

I would say that gradually, they became impressed with how detailed the dovetailing of the film and the statements were to what they had on paper. And so the, I think the confidence grew as, as we went along, and that when they found that statements and pictures really were incriminating, they felt that it would bolster their case. I think it was quite surprising and very enterprising of Justice Jackson, coming from the background that he did \u2014 after all, he wasn\u2019t John Ford from Hollywood \u2014 that he was as, as, as open to the use of film, which was so innovative and had never been done, as he was. He was really very sympathetic to its use, as long as, as long as we were diligent. Ben Kaplan who\u2019s this very nice guy that I still talk to on the Vineyard. He was very, very tough, and he was rather snooty about it. I mean, he was doing it because they told him, but his heart wasn\u2019t really in it, I don\u2019t think. But he would put it to very tough legal tests as to whether it was just movies or it really was, really was indictable evidence, which was good, really. That was useful.

And I just hit the ceiling, because all this stuff was very valuable in a private profit-making way. It was all very hot film, you might say. I had nightmares about how people might try to grab it and steal it and, and, and sell it. And this colonel in the army, I asked that, I talked to Kellogg about him and asked that he be removed from us. I talked to people about \u2014 you must not \u2014everybody has to be absolutely, totally honest about this, and, and scrupulous about it.

Yeah, I felt awfully good last month, when I went for the 40\", and, and uh saw these men who are now about 60 years old, who were really uh kids some were quite almost wild kids who were running the streets and, uh, it was very, it was very moving for me to, when I, I call on the phone to University of California at Northridge, and, and, the voice I hear is this very deep, profound-sounding voice saying, this is Professor Scott, please leave a message, and I think of this Professor Scott as this w-wild kid of nineteen, he was, uh, he had been in the riots and throwing Molotov cocktails and all this. When I went down there, I went down on the first day that the, that the curfew was lifted and it was pretty wild still there. Some buildings were still smoking and smoldering, and there were little fires in the different open lots, and it was very, it was very, very tense, and I got this idea, sort of a wild idea, of starting a writer\u2019s workshop, and, and I put up a notice in a, it was kind of a settlement house called Westminster. I just put a sign up on the bulletin board saying \u201cWriter\u2019s Workshop, anybody interested sign below.\u201d And I said I would be back every Wednesday. It took me a long time, for about 2 2 months nobody came. Nobody came. I just sat there. I just sat there, and I learned a lot about Watts. I read the local paper, The Sentinel, I talked with the social workers. I went down in the, in the pool hall, sat around there, got kind of snubbed and glared at. I learned a lot, and my wife Geraldine was sort of taunting me about this, and she said, \u2019'd come back and she said, \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d I'd say, \u201cWell nobody showed up.\u201d This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And she\u2019d say, \u201cHow long can you really, sort of a Don Quixote act, this is getting ridiculous, how many times can you go to Watts and nobody shows up?\u201d And I said \u201cWell, I think I'll just wait till, Pll give it from August until Thanksgiving.\u201d This is now into, maybe early October. And I said, \u201cIf nobody shows up by Thanksgiving ok, I'll, uh, PIl pack it in.\u201d Finally, finally, the next time I went down, this one guy came. And it was, it was Charles, uh, Taylor, and he came with a young somewhat, uh, somewhat demented, uh, young man, very disturbed. And, uh, and this Charles sat opposite me and the young man sat right up, right next to me and just staring right at me. It was a, uh, strange, just stared at me. And, uh, anyway, I brought down Claude Brown\u2019s book, Manchild in the Promised Land and this guy Charles said, \u201cWhat is all this? What are you up to? What are you trying to do?\u201d He was rather, a little bit belligerent, challenging, and I said, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s no mystery to it, I\u2019m trying to start a writer\u2019s workshop.\u201d And I then read to him some excerpts from Manchild in a Troubled Land, and it was a little bit about, about Claude at the age of about 10, and, uh, there\u2019s been a riot in, in, uh, in Harlem, and he\u2019s too small to go to it but his big brother\u2019s saying, \u201cBoy it was great. We got a, we got a television set, and a radio and this and that,\u201d and, um, little Claude says, he writes this, \u201cGee, that sounds like such fun. When can we have another one, when can we have another riot?\u201d And when I read that out loud to him, his reaction was amazing, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were allowed to write that in a book!\u201d He said, \u201cWould they arrest him for that?\u201d And I said, \u201cNot only not arrest him, this book is a major bestseller. He\u2019s making a lot of money out of this book.\u201d Well, he was just amazed. And that was, that really opened the door, I think he went back, because next the day, next Wednesday, two or three people showed up with him, I think, including Johnny Scott and a few other young poets. I\u2019Il make this short, but what they showed me \u2014I couldn\u2019t believe. Their work was so goddamn good. Johnny Scott was a goddamn genius. I read some the other day, it\u2019s so good, and some of the others were too. And that was the beginning. I then went to Los Angeles magazine and told them about this, and I showed them the work, and so they ran a piece with a page of their poetry and, uh, Jime Magazine picked up on it, did a big story \u2014 also running a page of Johnny Scott and Jimmy Sherman, Sammy Harris, all these young poets. And for that to be in Time Magazine was a huge, huge thing. And they were offered money. Then it got bigger and bigger, and it\u2019s still going. We have now, now we have in New York, and when I got to New York I started it there, and we now have the Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center on, uh, on 96\" Street. And there we have a faculty of twenty, and it\u2019s, it\u2019s much more, much more structured now. Now it\u2019s a real writing school, and, uh, it\u2019s going very strong. "
