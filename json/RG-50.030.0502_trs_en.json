                " (Take us from New York to California.) We left when I was about six years old. And my father had been working for Adolf Zukor, Famous Players, as a writer and publicist, from about the age of 18 \u0152 he started very, very young. But by the time I was born, he decided he would like to branch out on his own. And become his own film company producer. So we went out to Hollywood very early. I really remember the ride on that train. It was on the old Chief, Santa Fe Chief, before the Superchief, even. And I vaguely remember that , being out on the observation car, and watching the country fall away behind us. My father and Louis Mayer, later the famous th ird \ufb01M\ufb02 at MGM \u0152 the two of them together set up a very early film studio, way downtown, not in what we call Hollywood now, but down by the railroad tracks, way downtown Los Angeles. It was called the Mayer-Schulberg studio. So both Mayer and BP, so they both were making th ese early silent films. That\u2122s about it. My father\u2122s big discovery was Clara Bow. He found her in a Brooklyn beauty contest, actually, signed her for 50 bucks a week, and brought her to Hollywood. I called Clara sort of a pre-Marilyn Monroe sex queen, sex appeal queen. Sh e was known as the, as the \ufb01It\ufb02 girl, from a famous novel of the time, and movie called \ufb01It.\ufb02 And she had it. Clara really did have It. She really did. She\u2122s still amazing to watch in those silent films. And that\u2122s so \u0152 2 My father and Louis made their films for a few y ears, for about three or four years, and then Louis Mayer went to the newly formed MGM. And at that point my father went over, went back to Zukor, in a sense, and became head of the, of the west coast studio of Paramount. And so, all through my young manhood, growing up, I really grew up on the, in a way, on the backlot. I used to go there almost every day on my bike , drove through those famous gates, and roam around and play on the backlot sets, and wander into different stages where they were shooting amazing films. So all these famous stars were like old hat to us \u0152 they were more like people who just worked for my father \u0152 was the way we thought of them. "

                " (How early did you get interested in writing?) Very, very early, I\u2122d say I was about 9 or 10, very early. It was very much a part of our household atmosphere. My father had started as a writer, with the, with those early photoplays. And he, also as a kid, worked on the old Daily Mail and a short time on the old World \u0152 papers that we, that we dearly miss. There used to be about ten daily papers, and now we\u2122re down to about two and a half. So, so he, he had a great interest in, aside from film , in uh writing. And my mother was a frustrated librarian. And she set up a very big library, thousands of books, all set up like a regular library, all numbered like a library, a real library. My father used to \u0152 Sunday morning was a ritual. He would read from the classics, aloud to us, Sunday mornings until brunch, from about 9:30 or so. It\u2122s amazing what we read. We read through Dickens and Melville and Galsworthy, a nd we, how we, Sunday after Sunday for years and years, we heard that. So writing was very mu ch part of our life. So I started when I was about 9 or 10, started to write little stories, very much encouraged by my parents. So by the time I went to high school, I just thought of myself as a wr iter, as if it was already my profession. And it all went \u0152 it fell in place very natura lly. I edited the high school \u0152 Los Angeles High School daily paper. We had a daily paper. I la ugh because these days, my kids at Westhampton High School couldn\u2122t get out a mont hly paper, and the thought of a daily paper, they couldn\u2122t imagine putting it out every day. But we did. So anyway, that\u2122s why, so we breathed that atmosphere. My sister Sonya wrote a very good novel when she was about 19, that Scribners published, entitled, They Cried a Little. Sonya said that in our house, where in other homes they might have a piano and people might sit down \u0152 Sonya said, in our house, we had a typewriter, and as we passed we might type out a little jingle or someth ing or a little story, and we all, Sonya and Stuart, Stuart wrote very well, too.

                " (Let\u2122s jump forward to the approach of World War II. No w you have sudden success writing, right? Why don\u2122t you tell us about that period and give us a sense of Hollywood when the war started.). Well, 19 \u0152, let\u2122s see. When I got out of colle ge in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my father\u2122s assistant, had now set up his own studio, and was planning independent films, one of which of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born \u0152 which was the daddy of all those later Star is Borns. 4 And, let\u2122s see, I came back and started working for David as a young screenwriter. And I had a seven-year contract \u0152 it started at 50 and went to 75 a week. At the end of seven years, I would have been making $500. And, uh, but he, but even, a year and a half into it, I would write screenplays that David, I don\u2122t think ever read; he was so busy making the films he was already planning. . And then they would call us in \u0152 I thought of it as being a, sort of like being a pinch hitter who comes in off the bench. If there was some i mmediate problem, David w ould call Ring Lardner and me \u0152 we were a writing team. We were bot h about 21, 22 years old. We were just out of college. And he would call us in on \u0152like on A Star is Born. They couldn\u2122t figure out the ending of A Star is Born, and we wrote the ending of it, that one where Janet comes out of Grauman\u2122s Chinese and sees her husband\u2122s footprints and handprints, and when she\u2122s asked her name. She\u2122s now a big movie star, and he\u2122s gone down, and in fact he committed suicide because he couldn\u2122t stand his failure while she\u2122s gone up. And she looks down, and when they ask her on the radio, she says, \ufb01This is Mrs. Norman Maine.\ufb02 \u0152 and it\u2122s a big ending in the movie. Things like that, little bits and pieces. It wasn\u2122t awfully satisfying. By the time he was about to pick up my third opt ion, I went in to David and I asked David \u0152 I\u2122d known him so well for years and years \u0152 my moth er even put him, my mother really stage managed his wedding to Irene Mayer, my mother r eally sort of put them together, encouraged them. And I\u2122d known him since I was a kid, and I said, \ufb01David, do me a big favor, please, don\u2122t pick up my option.\ufb02 And David was really very hur t. He said \u0152 he felt really insulted, and he said, \ufb01Well, I have great plans for you. I was th inking that as I get older, I may retire, and you might be ready to take over for me, and then my young son Danny, Danny would work for you the way you work\u2013.\ufb02 You could see this going on until the 21 st century \u0152 a dynasty of the Selznicks and the Schulbergs. And I said, \ufb01Well, I appreciate that, David, I really want to be a writer, and not really a big producer, like you.\ufb02 And David said, he said, \ufb01Well,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01 I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer\ufb02 \u0152 and that hurt my feelings a little bit, but that\u2122s exactly what he said \u0152 he said, \ufb01I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer, but,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01I figure that sooner or later your producer\u2122s blood would begin to assert itself and that would kick in.\ufb02 I told Scott Fitzgerald that anecdote, and he used it in The Last Tycoon. It\u2122s in The Last Tycoon. So anyway, to cut this a little shorter, I finally did get out of there. I started writing short stories for Liberty and Colliers and for all the slick magazines. And I was doing very well with that. And one of the short stories was What Makes Sammy Run? And I then decided that I\u2122d like to put, work out there and try to develop that as a novel. And that, that caused me quite a bit of trouble. Because for one thing, I was, I was, I was a young member of the Communist Party (drinks) \u0152 (PAUSE) "

                " (Let\u2122s start that sentence again.) 5 We met secretly every week, once a week, and we all had lots of assignments. We were very busy infiltrating different organizations, the Screenwriters\u2122 Guild and the Anti-Nazi League \u0152 all kinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young Democrats, and we would try to infiltrate them, to influence them toward the communist program. So I asked at the meeting if I could be excused from my regular assignments in orde r to \u0152 I\u2122d like to stop and write this book. The answer was, \ufb01I guess you\u2122ll have to talk to Jack Lawson about that\ufb02 \u0152 Lawson was the head of the communist party \u0152 \ufb01to decide whether the book would be valuable enough to the party to justify your dropping your assignments.\ufb02 So I went to see Lawson, and Lawson was, was very tough, really tough and hardnosed. And Jack said, \ufb01Well, Budd, I think the only way we can handle this is that you make an outline of the book, show me the outline, and then if I th ink the book will be useful to the party, then I\u2122ll sort of supervise the writing of the book.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Jesus, Jack, I can\u2122t do that.\ufb02 And Jack started to give me things about the responsibil ity to the party. And that went on for many, many weeks, and I refused to do it. And they said, \ufb01No, you have to do it, or if you\u2013.\ufb02 Finally, one day I went home with my young wife, Jigee, and I said, \ufb01Jigee, I can\u2122t take the argument any more. It\u2122s just eating me up, and so what I want to do is get in the car and drive away and just leave. And even that was, even that \u0152 people don\u2122t realize how tightly disciplined the party was. You couldn\u2122t just get in a car and drive away. If you were going to New York you had to tell them where you were going. And then if you were staying more than two or three weeks, you were reassigned to a unit in New York. It was very tightly controlled. So I just \u0152 the very act of getting in a car and driving away was a very serious defiance of the party discipline. And when I got back to, I went back to Dartmouth, where I\u2122d gone to college, and found a little house, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a month, it was. And for the next year I worked on this book, Sammy. Meanwhile, while I was there, the Soviet-Nazi pact came down, and that drove me even further from the party, because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler, and suddenly, suddenly the party people were saying that it\u2122s just an imperialist war between the Germans and the English. And we should be ne utral and stuff, which I thought was a grave mistake, also. Also, and so I was even further alienated from the party. And I got the book done and, and went back and, uh, the top people like Lawson were mad, were very mad at me for going and doing this on my own. But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the People\u2122s World , which was the western edition of the Daily Work er, Charles Glenn was his name \u0152 he wrote a rave review of the book. He thought the book was the Hollywood book, if not maybe the great American novel that everyone was talking about \u0152 raved about it. That caused a firestorm apparently. They calle d him in and they gave him hell \u0152 Lawson and company. Two weeks later he re-reviewed the bo ok and he said, \ufb01On further consideration\ufb02 \u0152 and he even said, \ufb01It\u2122s been pointed out to me the shortcomings,\ufb02 and he absolutely trashed the book. Apparently they had threatened him that if he didn\u2122t, if he didn\u2122t do that he would be fired from the paper and maybe even kicked out of the party. He had to do it, and so he just trashed 6 the book. It was a terrible book. It didn\u2122t do that and it didn\u2122t do that. It was really disgraceful, just disgraceful. "

                " (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced with testifying?) Yeah. The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn fired me. He was just in a rage. When I came i n, he screamed at me. It was almost like that Judge Freisler. And he screamed at me. \ufb01You\u2122re a traitor! You\u2122re a traitor!\ufb02 Like that, he got purple, he was so mad. \ufb01How could you write that terrible book?!\ufb02 he screamed at me. And then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that \u0152 my father of course was a member and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father. He took off the same way, and he said, \ufb01B.P. I blam e you for this. You should have stopped him. It\u2122s your fault.\ufb02 He was yelling, too. You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing. My father said, \ufb01Louis, I did try to stop him. I wrote him a lett er begging him not to publish the book.\ufb02 I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me. \ufb01If you publish this book, it will ruin you. You\u2122ll never be able to live. You\u2122ll never get a job here again. And not only that, it will hurt me, it will hurt your mother \u0152 who was just entering the agency \u0152 it will hurt the whole family. You\u2122ve got to put \u0152 don\u2122 t publish the book.\ufb02 My father wrote that. Anyway, Louis Mayer said \u0152 he said, \ufb01You know what I think we should do with him?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I think we should deport him.\ufb02 A nd he really meant it. It was r eally sort of fascinating, because I always said that Hollywood in those days was like its own country. They thought of it as their own country. It was like Luxembourg or something. They ran that country. And they could do anything they wanted. The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name. He was on a weekly salary. They paid him every week. And they c ould do anything. They could cover up any crime. It never got in the paper. Clark Gable drunkenly killed someb ody. He did. And no one every heard about it. Nothing. Because they ran ever ything, including the press. It was really their country. So when Mayer said that \u0152 it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be deported. And my father \u0152 I always said my fath er was much more intelligent than Louis, he knew so much more, but he wasn\u2122t as smart in a pr actical way as Louis was. And my father said, \ufb01Louis,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01maybe you\u2122re right, but,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01where do you think his St. Helena should be?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Maybe we should deport him to Catalina Island.\ufb02 And according to my father, some of the producer s laughed, but Louis didn\u2122t think that was a bit funny. So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by both the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both. It wa s from both extremes. So I went back to New York, and \u0152 of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast. And then, from then on, which pretty much I\u2122ve done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth, which I\u2122ve tried to do. "

John Ford, of course he was a genius, but he had a, I think he had a kind of sadistic trait. Because when I came in to report \u0152 I\u2122d known him in Ho llywood, and I was still thinking of him as a movie director and me as a young writer. So I walk ed in and said, \ufb01Hi Jack, I\u2122m here, like, what do you want me to do?\ufb02 It was sort of like th at. And Ford was now a Navy Commander, and he said, \ufb01Ensign Schulberg, that\u2122s no way to report to your commander. Come to attention and salute and make an official report.\ufb02 And so on. I thought the guy was crazy, but I said, \ufb01Ensign Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.\ufb02 And he\u2122s said, \ufb01That\u2122s more like it.\ufb02 So he\u2122s like a standard stiff-necked Navy commander. It was so typical Ford, so I say, OK, if that\u2122s what he wants, I\u2122ll do it. I don\u2122t care. So the next time I come into his office I gi ve him a sal\u2013and say, \ufb01E nsign Schulberg reporting for duty, Sir.\ufb02 John Ford says to me, \ufb01Oh, for Christ\u2122s sake, Budd, you don\u2122t have to go through all that. Sit down. Let\u2122s talk.\ufb02 Like now he\u2122s just a movie dir ector again. That\u2122s the way he was. He loved to keep people off balance. That was a big thing with Ford, to keep them off balance. Whatever you thought he was going to say, he\u2122d say something different. But he took glee in, and he said, \ufb01We\u2122re going to send you to Fo rt Schuyler, and they\u2122ll really knock some Navy discipline into you.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01You\u2122re going to find it very tough.\ufb02 He couldn\u2122t wait for me to suffer there, at Fort Sc huyler. And so I went to Schuyler \u0152 I didn\u2122t mind it really, I found it rather interesting. Tough, but \u0152 and we\u2122d run around the Fort at 6 o\u2122clock in the morning and go all through this stuff, and so it was sort of interesting. And one really funny thing happened there. There were two little ensigns from the South. One was named Watts and the other was named Furr. One came from Mississippi and the other fr om Georgia. And they would always stare at me. I\u2122d be doing something and they\u2122d l ook up and they were staring at me. And one night after mess, I came back to my bunk, and they came over, and they said, \ufb01Excuse me, Schulberg, would you mind if we talk to you?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Well, no.\ufb02 So they sat down 9 opposite me in this little bunk. And I said, \ufb01OK, what do you want to talk about?\ufb02 And they said, in that thick southern accen t, I can\u2122t do it, they said: \ufb01Som eone told us that you were a Jew.\ufb02 And they said, \ufb01You know, we\u2122ve never seen one before.\ufb02 It was like looking at a koala bear from Australia or something, and they\u2122d never seen one before. And then they, and then we got to chatting a bit. And then they \u0152 they were very polite. He said, \ufb01Well, Sir, if you don\u2122t mind our asking,\ufb02 Furr said, \ufb01What do you do in civilian life?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Well, I\u2122m a writer.\ufb02 And Furr said, \ufb01A writer . That\u2122s interesting.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01We\u2122ve got a couple\ufb02 \u0152 he came from Oxford, Mi ssissippi \u0152 he said, \ufb01We\u2122ve got a couple of writers in our town.\ufb02 And I said, and I said, \ufb01You mean Fa ulkner?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Yeah, the Faulkner brothers, the brothers.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01You know, those two guys\ufb02 \u0152 he said, \ufb01I\u2122m a druggist.\ufb02 He worked in a drug store, and his whole view of Faulkner \u0152 he said, \ufb01These two Faulkner brothers,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01almost every morning, they come in and buy aspirin, because they\u2122ve got such bad headaches, because they drink so damn much at night.\ufb02 That was his \u0152 And I said, \ufb01Well\ufb02 \u0152 and I said, \ufb01William Faul kner? You know William Faulkner?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Well sure, I see him every morning.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01How do you know him?\ufb02 He had no idea that he was famous. He just thought he was a crazy guy in town. They had no idea he was a famous writer. They were so funny. They used to\u2013 After that, they would, whenever they saw me \u0152 I should write about them some time \u0152 they would \u0152(Drinks) Umm, whenever they saw me, they would say, \ufb01H i, Schulberg,\ufb02 and then they\u2122d look at each other, be sort of pleased. It was like that, I mea n, it was just a, I was just a bizarre thing to them. I didn\u2122t feel really anti-Semitism, it was just, simp ly, they had never seen one, that\u2122s all. ---------------(?) or something. It was so\u2013 And the final exam - it was just murder. You, you had to chart the, chart the passage of a ship, and you get all these instructions, thirty knots at this and then left to here and right to there, trying to take it from this one place all the wa y through the canal, to docking. And I didn\u2122t know what the hell I was doing. I was sweating. I said, \ufb01I\u2122m going to flunk this thing, Ford is going to kill me.\ufb02 I couldn\u2122t do it. I swear to God, as I\u2122m sweating this out, Furr an d Watts are sitting right across the aisle from me, and I see a hand coming in surreptitiously, a nd he shows me his paper so I could copy it and pass. They saved me. They saved me \u0152 Furr and Wa tts. God, they were sort of lovable, really. I\u2122m sure when they went home, big stories a bout how they met this Jew. Now we know one, like, we really saw one. "

I\u2122ve been there for three months or something. And I\u2122m very snapped up.

He was not ha ppy \u0152 he thought I was suffering there at Fort Schuyler. But after that, after that, the first nine or ten m onths or almost a year, we worked just in, in Washington. And Ford had made a film about, a film for public consumption about, about Pearl Harbor, and he asked me to write the, sort of the commentary, the narration, I mean, titles and stuff, and so on. I worked on films like that, wh ich was more or less like working in Hollywood. And, then he sent me overseas to London. I was there in the blitz, and we did some, some undercover work in, in London, and then Paris. And then we had some really interesting a ssignments. One was not really involved in photography. We were part of a l ittle group that, as soon as a German town fell, we would rush in and try to grab as much information \u0152 we w ould go to the SS headquart ers and things like that and grab papers and orders and things like that.

They had writers like me work with, on the team that would drop, drop agents behind the line. And each agent had about, a team of about eight that took care of th em. They all had different assignmen ts. One would just \u0152 took care of his general welfare. And, and one was involved in the aviation problems, when he could be dropped, the weather, and where, and stuff like that. And I as a writer would work on their cover story, which was very much like writing a story. It was exactly like writing a character in fiction, because you would find out what they really did, and then just adjust it to what they would say when they got, if they were interrogated. And so that was really interesting. Right before the end of the war, we had one, one guy who was a Danish agent. I was just amazed at the, at the crazy courage of these people. And he\u2122d become quite famous. He had been actually dropped in Berlin or something, or got to Berlin. He went to the Adlon Hotel, and became a big pal of some big SS general. He was posing as a, as a neutral salesman of some kind \u0152 I forget what the hell they thought he was selling \u0152 but he became a pal and drinking buddy, and so \u0152. Now it was quite near the end of the war, and his main worry was that the war might end before he could do 50 drops. He really was worried that the war would be over. He couldn\u2122t wait to get his fiftieth in. And, but three days before, three or four days before the end of the war, back he went again. I asked him, it\u2122s agains t regulations really, because everyt hing is so secret. But if he ever survived, if he ever came to the States, I\u2122d love to know what happened to him. Because it 11 was frustrating. When we did this work, when they made contact inside, they made someone, not us, but just someone, in London I think it was, so we would never know what happened, we didn\u2122t know whether they got killed or were doing great. We neve r could sort of complete the experience. So I asked him, if he ever got out, if he survived this last one, and got to the States, I wish he would look me up and tell me what the hell happened to him. But I never heard from him. I don\u2122t know what happened to him. "

What he did, and where it got mixed up is that, ap parently Stevens, at the end of the war got a film unit and went around photographing the concen tration camps, and made several films that were, I think, quite effective. But of course that was not involved at all in the Nuremberg Trial. For one thing, as I mentioned last night, we could only use film that the Germans themselves had shot and prepared, so anything that George Stevens did with our army people would not be admissible evidence.

Why don\u2122t you tell us, give us some detail about ho w it came about, your suggestion about photographic evidence, and when you firs t came to Nuremberg, too, if you can go on to that.) At the end of the war, after the war was, was over, General Bill Donovan was very interested in, was one of the first, I think, to be strongly in favor of an international tribunal to try the major war criminals. And he, he called a meeting \u0152 I need some water, too, cause my mouth gets dry from talking so much. (Drinks) He called a meeting of, of a ll the various OSS departments to discuss how the OSS could contribute to the building of an international trial. And agai n, Ray Kellogg, maybe Ford, but I worked much more closely with Kellogg than I di d with Ford \u0152 Ford was over Kellogg, and Ford might make suggestions to Ray, Ray Kellogg, but Kellogg was my immediate superior. So I guess Ray just chose me to go to the meeting, and so I did, and there was Bill Donovan talking about the importance of the impending trial. And he felt that the OSS was logically set up to make a major contribution to their intelligence work and all the rest of it. I got the feeling at the meeting that, that I think Donovan saw himself as the main, would be the main U.S. prosecutor. I think he really hoped to have the job that eventually went to Justice Robert Jackson. Anyway, each one spoke up about what they coul d do, and naturally, coming from the Film OSS Photographic \u0152 it was only logical to say that maybe there was photographic evidence that we could use at, at a trial. As a result of that meeting, Kellogg then put me in, in charge of a photographic team that would look, search for and gather and edit and present the photographic evidence at the trial. And so, so I \u2013 Then I went back to Berlin, and, where, where the OSS was headquartered, and, and \u0152 with my brother Stuart, to be in charge of the still photographic evidence. So, he set up in, I think in Wiesbaden. And Stuart got the, the cooperation of Hans Hoffmann, who was Hitler\u2122s official photographer. And Hoffmann, who \u0152 oddly eno ugh, his son in law was Baldur, Baldur von Schirach, the, who was on trial, the head of the Hitlerjugend . It was really ironic because in a sense the father in law was helping to hang his son in law. But as I point out \u0152 with all the Germans that we worked with they, once we won, they would do anything we wanted, that they were completely submissive, really, and cooperative, almost to a slavish point. I mean, I was sort of disgusted with it, in a way. We woul d say that the \u0152 feeling anti-German at that time, because we did feel that the country really overwhelmingly had supported Hitler. You see those cr owds of millions and millions of people would turn out for 14 those rallies. And we said that we thought of the Germans as being either, either at your throat or, or at your feet. That\u2122s what we said. And at that point, we found them willing \u0152 that even formerly Nazi people would do anything that you, anything that you wanted, because they we re scared of us also. But by then we were the conquerors and they were scared about what we might do to them. "

Joe, Joe Louis\u2122s uh, when\u0160 it was a, famous story that, there was, you know, that was \u0152 Braddock\u2122s manager was Jewish, and, and Goebbels was worki ng very hard to set up a championship fight between Braddock the champion and Max Schmeli ng in Germany. And Joe Gould, the manager \u0152 I went to see him in the hospital shortly before he died. And whether he made it up or not, Joe Gould told me that, that he got a phone call from Schmeling in Germany, and Max was dying to set up this rematch with Louis. And, so he called. Joe Gould was actually at, at Stillman\u2122s Gym when he got the call. And Schmeling said, \ufb01J oe, I\u2122m here with, with, I\u2122m here with Mr. Goebbels in his office, and he would like to talk to you.\ufb02 And so there was Goebbels in Berlin talking to this little Jewish guy in Stillman\u2122s Gym. And of course now, it sounds made up, but what, what Joe Gould told me that day in the hos pital was that, he said, Goebbels said, \ufb01We\u2122re very anxious to arrange a championship match be tween your fighter and our fighter, in Berlin, and we, and we want to know what your conditions are.\ufb02 And Gould said, \ufb01Well first, I want 500,000 dollars in a New York bank before we leave. \ufb02 And he said that Goebbels said, \ufb01Well, that\u2122s no problem.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01And also, we want, one judge must be American, and we want an English referee.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Well, just a minute, I\u2122ll have to ask Mr. Schmeling.\ufb02 Then he came back he said, \ufb01Mr Schmeling says that\u2122s OK, too.\ufb02 And then he said, \ufb01And we want ten first class passages, and, and first class accommodation for ten people in your best hotel,\ufb02 and so on. And he said, \ufb01Alright that\u2122ll be alright. Is there any other condition?\ufb02 16 Gould said that he said, \ufb01Well, there\u2122s just one more. We\u2122d like you to release all, all the Jews from your concentration camps.\ufb02 So that was \u212238. So by that time we were hear ing rumors about the concentration camps. It was beginning to get out. They were just starting. I\u2122m not sure exactly when they set them up. But there were only a few in the beginning. I think Dachau was one of the early ones. Incidentally I, getting ready for the Nuremberg trial, I went to the Dachau trial as an observer. I didn\u2122t work on the trial, in fact, I was an observer at the trial. "

So we got, so as a shortcut, we thought we\u2122d look at all the Fox Movietone footage, because actually that was produced, had come from Germany, and so we got all of that, and it, I thought it didn\u2122t answer all, all the things he was asking for, but some of them. And so I, I went down with a list. And at that point Donovan, Jim Do novan said, \ufb01Well, Budd, that\u2122s film that was released in the United States. Even though the source was German, we can\u2122t use anything that was at the influence, say, of Fox Movietonews, because the defense attorneys would jump in and say \u201aThat, 17 that\u2122s not admissible evidence, it might have been doctored,\u2122 if they can\u2122t tell what happened to it, and so forth.

I wasn\u2122t sure we could really do it at all. And then we heard that that film was, the German film was all in the Russian sector, which made it even more difficult for us. It\u2122s sort of a long story, Raye, but I went to the head of the Russian archives, this unusual man, uh, Major Avenerius he was, and I told him what we were looking for, and as I said last night, he, he asked me, well, he said, \ufb01Did you come up from the John Ford unit?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Yes,\ufb02 and he said, \ufb01Well, that\u2122s very interesting.\ufb02 And it turned out that he was a John Ford scholar. He knew every, he really knew every Ford movie. He named them, he must have named twenty of them or more, every single one, all the way back to the early 20s. He knew the obscure silent films. He knew every damned shot. It turned out he was a\u2013 He was like really basically a civilian, and he\u2122d been a professor at the film institute in Moscow, and John Ford was his favorite of all world directors. John Ford was his favorite director. He knew everything about Ford. And he found it very interesting that Ford was the commander of th e outfit. And he asked me if Ford would be coming, and I said \ufb01Well, yes he mi ght come, just to inspect what we\u2122re doing.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Would you introduce me to him?\ufb02 All his life he\u2122d wanted to meet John Ford. I said, \ufb01Well, sure, if he comes. I think he may come.\ufb02 And with that, th at opened the door. He told me to come back in the morning. And he opened up to us only, German, not all but a lot of the German newsreel film that they had shot themselves, and that we, a great deal of that record, the whole record of the growth of the Nazis and their coming to power of ficially through that strange uh, actually through an election, and all the rest of it. So much of that film that we got from him the next day [coughs] we got because of the John Ford connection. We actually got a truck and loaded the truck with film. We had, we only showed four hours at the trial but we had maybe forty or fi fty hours.

Let\u2122s go back into that, so you can tell us where, and some of t hose things about the film conditions, and how you could handle film, both viewing it, copyi ng it, all of that. So, go ahead.) Well, we got so much of this film from him, as I mentioned last night, and after a few days of this, he suddenly stopped and suddenly became a little more stiff. Apparently his colonel had objected to his giving us so mu ch film, even though the Soviet Union was one of the four parties represented in the prosecution. But the colonel stopped it. And then, I won\u2122t go into so much detail, but then we had to win over the colonel, which we did with this lavish party that we threw for him, an all night into th e dawn party. When the colonel got drunk enough and softened up, 18 and we showed them the July 20 th trial, which they were very in terested in, and they wanted a \u0152 we had that and they didn\u2122t \u0152 and they wanted a copy of that, which we would make for them. And so, softened up, the colonel then gave us permission to drive way into the Soviet sector. And it was on that trip that \u0152 which the Russians said it was the furthest any Americans had been allowed in to penetrate the Soviet sector \u0152 they knew of this tunnel where film had \u2013 I should backtrack. My two, my two SS film editors \u0152 we had recr uited them from a POW camp \u0152 Walter Rothe and Curt von Molo were their names - and they told us that there were films made of, actually showing the Jews being shoved into cattle cars and ripped of their rings and jewelry and, and various atrocious things that the SS were doing to these poor Jewish victims. And, they had both worked on those, edited those films, and had shown them to Goebbels and Himmler, and obscenely, they called them \u201adesserts,\u2122 because th ey would be shown after dinner like a dessert in a \u0152 I guess as an amusement, partly an amusement but partly it was supposed to be reporting. These were like SS reports on what they were accomplishing. And they told us that there were a great many of these films. And th e Russians said that they might be in this place, where they\u2122d been sort of sealed up in a tunnel. And they did take us there, and it was on fire. It was burning. It was almost, it, it was, God, it looked like acres of film were burning. We did pick up little pieces. And then they told us about two, two places in the sector, one called Rossleben and, and Rudersdorf \u0152 two small towns where the same thing. They would apparently make a tunnel into a mountainside or a hillside, and then seal up this film. And they were hiding it. And, and so we drove to both places. And in both places, of course, Rossleben and Rudersdorf, we found the same thing that we had found in the Russian sect or. The film was burning, or had been burned \u0152 acres of it. It was huge. And once again, we were cheated out of getting what would have been just invaluable stuff. And again, we picked up here and there \u0152 it would be like a foot of, of film that was \u0152 you could see what it was if you held it to the light. And we did find some of that and made copies of it and, and brought that, and brought that down to Nuremberg.

I had told Jim Donovan that we could run, I thought we could, at one point I could see running all day from 9 to 5, and we could run all day. And he said, well obviously, we can\u2122t do that. And we finally worked it down. Jim Donovan suggested four hours. And so we went back and reviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the indictment that our film would relate to, but it, th e... We had four film ed itors and they literally worked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mea n, they worked until two and three in the morning, and started again at 7, they just worked around the clock. And that film unit had so damn much film \u0152 "

No, I don\u2122t think they were overjoyed. I think they were worried. They looked worried really. They looked very, they were very concerned. Goering is, is interesting. Goering was by far the smartest of all the people on trial. I remember the day at our hotel, when the captain psychiatrist came rushing in, all excited. He\u2122d been testing the IQs of the various defendants. And he said, \ufb01My God, that Goering he acts like a clown. He\u2122s a genius.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01His IQ went through the roof, he\u2122s so smart.\ufb02 That guy\u2122s name was Murphy, Captain Murphy, who strangely enough years later committed suicide also. I don\u2122t remember why. But Goering tended to take the whole trial very se riously, as I mentioned last night. He acted like, as a defendant was who feels that he has a chance of being found not guilty. I don\u2122t know if he really thought so, but that\u2122s the way he acted, and that was his demeanor most of the time in the courtroom. He would take notes, and he woul d consult with his attorney, and so forth, and he took it very seriously. Some just sat like, as if they were staring. Streicher had a funny look on his face. And the two military people, Keitel of the Army and Adm. Jo dl [sic] very clearly, very clearly were saying, were disassociating, their attitude was, we shouldn\u2122t be here, and we have nothing to do with this. And they would sort of turn away, and act rather haughty, like that. They were all kind of different. 24 But it is true that the day of the Nazi Plan screening I was very, it was like three months of work, it was like your movie is about to open, and I was very keen to get there. I purposely got there as early, so early I think I was the firs t one to walk in, and so I was able to get a seat. I sat at the end of the Russian table, and that table \u0152 as I noticed again last night \u0152 was like maybe ten feet from the dock, and from that vantage point, I was ab le to watch them.

                " (OK, I think we\u2122re out of here, right?) END Tape 2 25 Tape 3 of 3: Leni Riefenstahl. Well, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us. [Sound problem \u0152 Boom mike was missing.] Well, the \u0152 of all the Nazi propaganda films th at, many were made, by far the most, by far the most illustrious, or you might say notorious, of th e Germans was Leni Riefenstahl\u2122s master film of the Nazi party day \u0152 I think it was the seventh \u0152 called the Triumph of the Will. It was shot in a way that you could see obviously idolized and made heroes of the people, by shooting at a low angle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, a sens e of really ex-, ex-, exalting them. The film, which was about a three-hour, very long documentary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of work. It was overwhelming. The, the idea that Go ebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that could be shown, it was not only for German consumption. It was shown all over Europe. And I think that it definitely made a contribution to the capitulation of the western democracies, capitulating to Hitler, letting him make one act of aggression after another, in the Rhineland, and the Sudetenland, and on and on they went, one little step at a time. And the feeling was that, looking at that film, that it would make the non-German countries and their leaders say, \ufb01How can we possibly defeat that power?\ufb02 It was overwhelming, just overwhelming. I think it was General Donovan who said that the Triumph of the Will was worth two Wehrmacht divisions. It was a powerful piece of propaganda. And so, it was, it didn\u2122t take any genius to think that we ought to talk to Leni Riefenstahl. She not only made that one masterwork, but she made a number of small Parteitag films or reports. She was very closely tied in with the whole Nazi propaganda machine. And so it was obvious that we would want to, to speak with her and, and examine her, and bring her to Nuremberg. And so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in Berlin, and they directed to me to some place in Strasbourg. And I went there, and then I went to Kitzb\u00fchl. And one by one, I got closer and closer to finding out where she actually was living \u0152 sort of hiding in the open, in a way. It wasn\u2122t exactly hiding but she wasn\u2122t advertising either, what her address was. And so I was able to actually, with a weapons carrier and an army driver, I was able to go to her house and literally just knock on the door. She wa s living in a very nice place \u0152 it was a big, big, rustic \u0152 it looked like three stories \u0152 a very, quite large \u0152 on a, overlooking a Bavarian lake. It was a very nice place. So that\u2122s what I did. I just knocked on the door and somebody came to the door. And I was in my Navy uniform, of course. A nd I said, \ufb01I would like to speak to Miss Riefenstahl.\ufb02 And they let me in. It was a littl e man, said he would call her. So I sat down, and 26 I waited. It took a very long time for her to come . I think it was almost half an hour, maybe. She took a very long time coming. I think she was ma king up. After all, she was a movie star as well as a filmmaker \u0152 big star in Germany \u0152all these famous ice movies that she made, and mountain movies. And she finally came, and I sat with her on a couc h. And she started right away working on me. She said, of course, \ufb01I\u2122m a film artist, and in ternationally respected.\ufb02 And she gave a very positive rundown on herself. And she said, \ufb01I\u2122m respected ever ywhere in London, in Hollywood, and so forth, and I\u2122m not a Nazi, I\u2122m a pure film artist.\ufb02 That was her own party line and, boy, she stuck to it pretty well, too. And, and when she told me how well received she was in Hollywood, of course that was my hometown. She didn\u2122t know that I came from Hollywood. She just saw a young, an American officer who wa s trying to do her in. And she told me that, after all, even in 1938 everyone in Hollywood received her as a pur e filmmaker and fellow artist. And I didn\u2122t tell her that I was in Hollywood when she came. Hal Roach was an extremely rightwing \u0152 the old comedy producer/director Hal Ro ach gave a party for her, a big reception party, and asked all the main pe ople in Hollywood to come. And all of the liberal people like Melvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan and Dorothy Parker and so many, Freddy March \u0152 a whole bunch, there must have been twenty \u0152 they were each given a list of ten people to phone and say, \ufb01Don\u2122t go.\ufb02 I had a list myself. And the party was a fiasco. Only about eight or ten people \u0152 just the extreme right wing people like Victor McLaglen, people like that \u0152 only the fascist minded people, of which there were unpleasantly some in Hollywood. It was a total fiasco. Basically, the party was a disaster for her. But I didn\u2122t tell her that. I just listened and listened. But as I said last night, I had this warrant for her in my pocket. It was like burning a hole in my pocket. I thought, I would just let her talk a little longer, so I relaxed her. I didn\u2122t argue with her at all about what she thought she was. Finally I took the thing out and said, \ufb01Miss Rief enstahl, I\u2122m sorry, but I have to take you to Nuremberg.\ufb02 And that\u2122s when she screamed \ufb01P uppi, Puppi, they\u2122re, he\u2122s arresting me,\ufb02 she screamed. \ufb01He\u2122s arresting me.\ufb02 And he ran in. I didn\u2122t know at the time, he was a major in the Wehrmacht. And I told her, I tried to reassure her, I said, \ufb01Look, you\u2122re not being put on trial with Goering and von Ribbentrop, but we do need you as a material witness, and you\u2122ll be held, you\u2122ll be put up in one of the hotels, and held until the court releases you.\ufb02 And so out we went. We went in \u0152 I wish I had a photo of that \u0152 because sitting outside was a weapons carrier, like an open truck almost. It was just the three of us, and we drove from there, from Kitzb\u00fchl, all the way to Nuremberg. She didn\u2122t say anything on the way. She was just silent. She didn\u2122t say anything. She was very ticked off \u0152 very. And I guess scared. "

                " (Could you tell us a little more about the SS editors? Von Molo & Rothe \u0152 what were their sympathies? What were their attitudes to what the Nazis had done?) Well, Walter Rothe was, had been a Fox Moviet one film editor, he was a newsreel editor. Curt von Molo had been a feature film, film editor. He told me that he had worked with Fritz Lang and with some of the top German direct ors, and he seemed very, he seemed quite intelligent. And the two of them, instead of be ing two Nazi POWs that might have managed sympathy for each other, the two of them couldn\u2122t st and each other. They didn\u2122t like each other. And each, both of them told me \u0152 \ufb01I was recruite d into the SS film unit but I was, I didn\u2122t want to do it, but I had to or else.\ufb02 Each one said the same thing, \ufb01I was really anti Nazi.\ufb02 Each one said about the other guy: \ufb01Walter Rothe really wa s a Nazi. He was very sympathetic.\ufb02 And Rothe said the same thing about von Molo. He was anti Nazi but von Molo was pro-SS and wanted to get in that SS film unit. They both said that. They had no use for each ot her at all. I really didn\u2122t know which of them was right. Also, Curt von Molo told me that all through th e war, while he was working for the SS, that a Jewish film editor had been hiding in his attic, like in his house. And I took that with a grain of salt, because it was a joke to us. But from the fi rst crossing over into Germany, we didn\u2122t meet a German who didn\u2122t have a Jew in the attic. How could there be six million Jews in the concentration camps, because they must have all been up in the attics. Everybody we met, almost without fail, would say, \ufb01I was against Hitler and I saved a Jew in my attic.\ufb02 It got to be a joke with us. And von Molo said the same thing. He had this Jewish editor, and he said it was very precarious because he did work on these horrible SS films, at the same time. 29 I guess I didn\u2122t tell that last night. One Sunday, we \u0152 we would tend to try to rest on Sunday. We were, everybody was really wiped out by this work. One Sunday, I said to von Molo, \ufb01Look, Curt, I\u2122m really sick of hearing about these Je ws in the attic, I\u2122ve had it up to here with it, and I\u2122ve got to tell you I don\u2122t believe it, and he said, \ufb01Well, honestly, I\u2122m telling you the truth. It was that fellow, a friend of mine, that I worked with in the studio, you know, UFA.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Look, it\u2122s Sunday morning. Let\u2122s take the day off. We\u2122ll take a jeep, and you and I and a driver, we\u2122ll just drive around the whole day in Berlin.\ufb02 Because, that\u2122s right, he said, \ufb01Someone told me that he survived and that he\u2122s back. Someone said they saw him in Berlin, just a few days ago, and thank God, apparently he\u2122s alive.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Curt, let\u2122s take the day off. And we\u2122re going to look for this Jew in the attic.\ufb02 And we did. So we start out, and he noticed some girl in Nuremberg, and we go there and we find her \u0152 it was incredible we could find anybody, with how they were living \u0152 the place was a total disaster \u0152 people were living in holes and doorways and Christ knows, anyway this first girl says, \ufb01I heard that too.\ufb02 And I (referenced?) this person, we went to see him, it was amazing we\u2122d find anybody but there was still, even with everything down, there was a kind of amazing word of mouth. People seemed to know where other people were. And to cut this short \u0152 after a few hours of going from one (street?) to another, and finally to his actual, we found his own girlfriend, who had survived the war. She lived all the way through the war in Berlin. And she said, \ufb01Yes, he is, he\u2122s definitely here.\ufb02 And she told us where she thought he was. And we went there. And here comes this little Jewish guy, he was still in his concentration camp stripe s and still \u0152 he out, and he sees Curt, he hugs Curt, and he says to me , \ufb01This man saved my life. I actually lived in his attic.\ufb02 And we finally found a real Jew in the attic. An d apparently Curt was telling the truth the whole time. And from that time on, I became very, now I believed, now I knew that Curt was for real and that he really, he told me that Fritz Lang left, and he tried to leave, and got stopped, or something. He wasn\u2122t able to leave. He was hoping to leave, too. Now I believed him. Now I thought that Walter Rothe was a Nazi rat. But it really was an unbelievable story. "

Bob Parrish who unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago, he became one of my best friends. He was a wonderful man. He was more or less in charge of all the film editors. And he was a love ly man. He was a sort of child star. He was a 35 great pet of John Ford. Ford really loved Bob, and really helped him after he passed from acting to get in on the ground floor of film editing, he helped him a lot. And Ford \u0152 as nasty as I could find him \u0152 was always very beni gn with Bob. He really liked Bob. And Bob was a charming guy, as well as being very, very, very able. I think he won an Oscar later for Body and Soul, editing. And then later he became a film director, on his own. "

Well, I think of myself as being ve ry lucky, really, that I just happened to be in the right place at the right time and that I was very lucky they chose me for that job. They could have picked somebody else, I guess. And I think that just now, looking back that long ago as some, just one chapter in my life. In just a short time I\u2122ve celebrated the 60 th anniversary of the Nuremberg Trial. And quite recently I celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Watts Writers Workshop, that I got started when, on the day the curfew was lifted on the Watts riots, or the Uprising as they always called it down there. I think I\u2122ve been lucky that I\u2122ve been able to be at certain places at the right times. "

                " (Do you want to describe some more a bout the Watts Workshop? That seems like a wonderful\u2013) Well, I . . . . Yeah, I felt awfully good last month, when I went for the 40 th, and, and uh saw these men who are now about 60 years old, who were really uh kids some were quite almost wild kids who were running the streets and, uh, it was very, it was very moving for me to, when I, I call on the phone to University of California at Northridge, and, and, the voice I hear is this very deep, profound-sounding voice saying, this is Professor Scott, please leave a message, and I think of this Professor Scott as this w-wild kid of nineteen, he was, uh, he had been in the riots and throwing Molotov cocktails and all this. When I went down there, I went down on the first day that the, that the curfew was lifted and it was pretty wild still there. Some buildings were still smoking and smoldering, and there were little fires in the different open lots, and it was ve ry, it was very, very tense, and I got this idea, sort of a wild idea, of starting a writer\u2122s workshop, and, and I put up a notice in a, it was kind of a settlement house called Westminster. I just put a sign up on the bulletin board saying \ufb01Writer\u2122s Workshop, anybody interested sign below.\ufb02 And I said I would be back every Wednesday. It took me a long time, for about 2 \u00bd months nobody came. Nobody came. I just sat there. I just sat there, and I learned a lot ab out Watts. I read the local paper, The Sentinel, I talked with the social workers. I went down in the, in the pool hall, sat around there, got kind of snubbed and glared at. I learned a lot, and my wife Gera ldine was sort of taunting me about this, and she said, I\u2122d come back and she said, \ufb01Well, wh at happened?\ufb02 I\u2122d say, \ufb01Well nobody showed up.\ufb02 36 And she\u2122d say, \ufb01How long can you really, sort of a Don Quixote act, this is getting ridiculous, how many times can you go to Watts and nobody show s up?\ufb02 And I said \ufb01Well, I think I\u2122ll just wait till, I\u2122ll give it from Augus t until Thanksgiving.\ufb02 This is now into, maybe early October. And I said, \ufb01If nobody shows up by Thanksgiving ok, I\u2122ll, uh, I\u2122ll pack it in.\ufb02 Finally, finally, the next time I went down, this one guy came. And it was, it was Charles, uh, Taylor, and he came with a young somewhat, uh, somewhat demented, uh, young man, very disturbed. And, uh, and this Charles sat opposite me and the young man sat right up, right next to me and just staring right at me. It was a, uh, strange, just stared at me. And, uh, anyway, I brought down Claude Brown\u2122s book, Manchild in the Promised Land and this guy Charles said, \ufb01What is all this? What are you up to? What are you trying to do?\ufb02 He was rather, a little bit belligerent, challenging, and I said, \ufb01There\u2122s no mystery to it, I\u2122m trying to start a writer\u2122s workshop.\ufb02 And I then read to him some excerpts from Manchild in a Troubled Land, and it was a little bit about, about Claude at the age of about 10, and, uh, there\u2122s been a riot in, in, uh, in Harlem, and he\u2122s too small to go to it but his big brother\u2122s saying, \ufb01Boy it was great. We got a, we got a television set, and a radio and this and that,\ufb02 and, um, little Claude says, he writes this, \ufb01Gee, that sounds like such fun. When can we have another one, when can we have another riot?\ufb02 And when I read that out loud to him, his react ion was amazing, he said, \ufb01I didn\u2122t know you were allowed to write that in a book!\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Would they arrest him for that?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Not only not arrest him, this book is a major bestselle r. He\u2122s making a lot of money out of this book.\ufb02 Well, he was just amazed. And that was, that really opened the door, I think he went back, because next the day, next Wednesday, two or three people showed up with him, I think, including Johnny Scott and a few other young poets. I\u2122ll make this short, but what they showed me \u0152 I couldn\u2122t believe. Their work wa s so goddamn good. Johnny Scott was a goddamn genius. I read some the other day, it\u2122s so good, a nd some of the others were too. And that was the beginning. I then went to Los Angeles magazine and told them about this, and I showed them the work, and so they ran a piece with a page of their poetry and, uh, Time Magazine picked up on it, did a big story \u0152 also running a page of Johnny Scott and Jimmy Sherman, Sammy Harris, all these young poets. And for that to be in Time Magazine was a huge, huge thing. And they were offered money. Then it got bigger and bigger, and it\u2122s still going. We have now, now we have in New York, and when I got to New York I started it there, and we now have the Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center on, uh, on 96th Street. And there we have a faculty of twenty, and it\u2122s, it\u2122s much more, much more structured now. Now it\u2122s a real writing school, and, uh, it\u2122s going very strong. "
