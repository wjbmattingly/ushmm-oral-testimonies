            "question": "And was a point where you left Rivesaltes?",
            "answer": "Yes, I had a cousin named Erik Forst(ph), who was born in Germany, but he moved to France in 1939, so he was not a prisoner in any of the French concentration camps like his family was. So he, his mother and his sister lived somewhere in France, I do not know where. But all of a sudden he started showing up in Rivesaltes, and he was dressed brilliantly, he was dressed like an undercover Nazi or something. Now what do I mean by that? He was dressed in \u2014 in boots, high thigh boots. He was dir \u2014 dressed in \u2014 in flowery pants, horseback riding type pants. He was dressed in a shirt, and tie and a jacket, and wearing a French beret. And people in concentration camps were just not dressed like that, this was immaculate dressing. So over the years as I got older, I-I\u2019ve always want \u2014I remember every time he took a step that his boots creaked, the leather in his new boots creaked, I remember the sound 65 years later. And I wondered over the Interview with Fred Jarvis \" June 9, 2009 years, you know, what was this all about? But cousin Erik came to see us frequently in the camp, and he could have sa \u2014 he had safe passage in and out of the main gate and no one stopped him or challenged him. So I got to thinking, you know, maybe he was acting the part of some Gestapo agent or something, and nobody wanted to mess with him. But actually what he did, he came to visit us in the camp, and his plan was to plan an escape for us. So one dark night, my parents and I and my father\u2019s brother Leopold, and his wife Carrie and his son Kurt, who was a year and a half older than me, we all headed to the back of the camp, and my father gave the French \u2014 the French guard two packs of cigarettes and he turned his back. And we went through the barbed wife, down a short ravine and to a dirt road where my cousin Erik had an automobile and a driver waiting, and we piled into that car. My parents and his brother and his wife and Kurt piled into the back, that was five people, and cousin Erik jumped in front next to the driver, and I jumped in front next to cousin Erik and the door. So that was eight people in \u2014 in a car, I\u2019m sure we were a tight fit. And we took off in the dark of night without lights and my cousin Erik kept barking, ouvrir les lumi\u00e9res, fermer les lumi\u00e9res, meaning open the lights and close the lights, and we drove like that all night long according to what cousin Erik called for, and the driver obeyed him. And we drove for two nights, in the daytime we hid. And eventually we reached a Interview with Fred Jarvis \u201c June 9, 2009 small town by the name of Caussade, where cousin Erik had picked out a small farm for us to hide in and live. And we had, on this small farm we had, which was on top of a hill, we had one horse, one cow, one dog, chickens, ducks, geese and penned rabbits, which were our dinner. And we grew food, we grew \u2014 grew corn, we grew potatoes, we grew all kinds of vegetables, we grew grapes, and we su- subsisted on that farm. And we were on that farm about seven months before all of a sudden, a number of different French police types started to show up. And my parents, seeing them come up the hill from below, ordered me to go lay in the corn field and hide, they shouldn\u2019t count all \u2014 be able to count all of us. And one day there was so many of them that came, that \u2014 and they were stay there so long that I fell asleep in the cornfield, and when they had left, my parents couldn\u2019t find me and they were on a hunt calling Manfred, Manfred, you know on the \u2014 finally I woke up. But soon after that, they came with the German police, the Gestapo, and they rea \u2014 rearrested all of us and sent us back to Camp Rivesaltes. The men were so dangerous, obviously, that within this concentration camp they had another jail. Within the jail they had another jail, and they put the men in my family in that jail. And it was extraordinary and I remember that very well."

So cousin Kurt and I, we had to do the ob \u2014 driving him into town with our horse and wagon, and picking him up in the morning on the daily basis. So that was our contact in the town. We also wa-wandered into town occasionally, and sat along the general park area where men had outdoor restaurants or \u2014 or tables. And we sat among them, we didn\u2019t buy anything to eat, we didn\u2019t have any money. But, we really didn\u2019t talk to them. The only one that talked to any of the local people was cousin Erik. He was very friendly with the local police. And over the years, after they rearrested us and send us back to Camp Rivesaltes, I was always wondering, you know, would cousin Erik have anything to do with getting us rearrested, because he was so friendly with the local police there. I mean, you mind wanders, and you think \u2014 but no, that was not the case, they \u2014 they just tracked us down. And cousin Erik, apparently, I learned many years later, got warning from his friend in the police that the Gestapo was coming Interview with Fred Jarvis a\u201c June 9, 2009 to pick us up. And in those days there were no telephones to call the farm, or any communications, so cousin Erik hightailed it and \u2014 and they \u2014 we got caught. So \u2014 and as I re-revisited Caussade 60 years later, the chief of police told me that Erik had been told that they were coming for us, and that he escaped and \u2014 over the Spanish border, and came back after the war. How true that is, I \u2014 I can\u2019t vouch for, but that\u2019s what the local chief of police told me."

I had some kind of a chest disease, where I was being treated, where they put bottles, heated with cans, and put them on \u2014 on my back. I have no idea what it Interview with Fred Jarvis \u201c\u00b0 June 9, 2009 was, but it must have been pretty bad at the time. And in that hospital they gave me a little bit of milk, which was very difficult to get in \u2014 in the concentration camp. And I was somewhat weak, so I didn\u2019t finish my milk, and I put it at the head of my bed on the floor. And had this Spanish boy who was also in the hospital, and he made his way on my bed, and tried to s-steal that milk. And that was the very first fight that I ever remember being in as a boy. I smacked that boy in the lip, and I said, get out of here, that\u2019s mine. And that\u2019s what I remember of any Spanish boys in there. The Spanish mainly were people who hung around the perimeter of the barbed wire around the outside of the camp, who at times provided food for us, if we had a little money to purchase it, such as perhaps a can of beans, or if you were lucky, one egg. And \u2014 and nobody had a lot of money so the-they \u2014 but there were a lot of people there, so they had a ni \u2014 a\u2014a chance to sell small pieces of fruit to people, a piece of fruit. And people were able to cook it like a boy scout over la \u2014 over a fire made over rocks, and we can put a tin can on the rocks and \u2014 and boil whatever it was. I remember my mother was cooking a can of beans one time over such a rock system, which a \u2014 rather a lot of people were able to do. And I was playing around that, and I knocked that can of beans over, and that was a disaster. And it was \u2014 it was just \u2014 just \u2014 just a disaster. That can of bean would have been a feast for us. Also, these combination of French and Interview with Fred Jarvis ot June 9, 2009 Spanish people, since we had no beds to sleep on, we slept on the concrete floor with a little bit of straw under us, if we could find some. They built a primitive wooden beds for someone who had a \u2014 a few cents, I-I have no idea what they sold it for, but they were \u2014 sold quite a few of them, so \u2014 and they were nothing that you would want to sleep on, but for an inmate to sleep off the floor, you know, like 10 inches off the floor rather than on the floor was a \u2014 was a \u2014 just awesome."

Every morning session we studied baking and baking technology. In the afternoon sessions we would get our \u2014 our other lessons. And after four years I graduated as a pastry chef. I worked as a baker and cake decorator for 40 years, 18 hours a day, standing on my feet, no lunch breaks, nothing. But I was a talented baker and \u2014 and well in demand. I ran into trouble with the unions, because I never got a raise, never got a Christmas bonus, so I quit the union, and I started as a baby photographer. After about a year I opened my own photography store, and I managed to be a photographer in New York City for 10 years."

            "answer": "Well, I \u2014 Rivesaltes had been a very deep part of my life. It\u2019s where I escaped twice, with my parents and without them, and where I spent a very desperate time of my life. And I never had the money to go back, but I understood no one could go there because the French army had built a rifle range and they \u2014 if you tried to get in there, they\u2019d lock you up. So later on in life, as I was able to accumulate money, I decided I wanted to go back, I want to see first Gurs. Gurs is only \u2014 Gurs \u2014 my grandmother\u2019s grave is in Gurs. The only thing standing of the concentration camp in Gurs at this time 1s the cemetery. Everything else was planted into a forest. So I went there to see my grandmother\u2019s grave, and as we Jews do, we don\u2019t leave flowers, we leave a stone on the grave. And so I paid my respect there. I wanted to go to Rivesaltes, which it was only a hundred miles away, but couldn\u2019t get in. So instead, I went to Caussade, where we were \u2014 where we were headed on \u2014 hidden on that farm. Came back to the United States and in 19 \u2014 in 2008, I found an article on the internet by the New York Times, that the French government had purchased something like 40 acres of the Rivesaltes Interview with Fred Jarvis * June 9, 2009 concentration camp, and was planning to build, in conjunction with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, a 40 million dollar memorial to the people who went through there. And I wanted to see what this camp looked like today before they built a memorial. So I booked passage over there, and not having spoken French for over 30 years, I was no longer fluent in it, so I hired a driver with an automobile who would speak French and spoke fluent English. And my travel agent was fortunate to hire such a person for me. I flew to Perpignan, and took a hotel there, and I decided to stay there for eight days, because I didn\u2019t want to spend two days there and not achieve what I came to do, and I brought my \u2014 being a professional photographer, I brought my camera along, and this gentleman knew just the way to the camp, and I was able to get in to the camp, and I took between 1500 and 2000 photographs over a period of eight days, I photographed everything that I could find 1n this concentration camp, so that I could show myself and my children and my family where I actually was in 1942. That\u2019s why I wanted to go back there."

Several generations of people besides Jews had been put through this camp, including the ar \u2014 Harkis and Gypsies and \u2014 and German war \u2014 World War II prisoners after the war. And there was no street recognizable, everything was in decay, barracks were falling apart, in various stages, which is why I photographed it so intensely.

The ilos(ph) themselves were barely recog \u2014 there was no markings for ilo(ph) E, ilo(ph) B, ilo(ph) A. You couldn\u2019t recognize anything.

I couldn\u2019t even find the area where we escaped from, and I looked very \u2014 very hardly for that.

So, 1-1t was \u2014 it was something that I felt I had to do. I also went into Poland, to Auschwitz, to see Auschwitz where my parents were murdered, and photographed everything I could there.

We bought a business in Bristol. And she said no, I\u2019m not moving. So I worked in \u2014 in Withville(ph) until I lost the business there. And then John told me working for King pharmaceuticals.

He came in and out of that concentration camp like he owned it. And he wore brand new boots, every time he took a step they creaked. And he wore a jacket and pants and shirt and a tie in the concentration camp, and the French beret. He looked like Superman himself."

Kurt and I had to take these goats grazing on alternate days, Kurt one day, I the next. These goats were just such a bother to me because each one wanted to go a different way constantly. But they provided milk for me, and the big one I rode like a horse. Plus, we got to eat one of them at Christmastime. This was life in the fast lane in World War II, Neyron, France, Ain."
