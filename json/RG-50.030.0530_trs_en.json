            "question": "And was a point where you left Rivesaltes?",
            "answer": "Yes, I had a cousin named Erik Forst(ph), who was born in Germany , but he moved to France in 1939, so he was not a pr isoner in any of the French concentration camps like his family was. So he, his mother and his sister lived somewhere in France, I do not know where. But all of a sudden he started showing up in Rivesaltes , and he was dressed brilliantly, he was dressed like an undercover Nazi or something. Now what do I mean by that? He was dressed in \u0152 in boots, high thigh boots. He was dir \u0152 dr essed in \u0152 in flowery pants, horseback riding type pants. He was dressed in a sh irt, and tie and a jacket, and wearing a French beret. And people in concentration camps were just not dressed like that, this was immaculate dressing. So over the years as I got older, I-I\u2122ve always want \u0152 I remember every time he took a step that his boots creaked, the leather in his new boots creaked, I remember the sound 65 years late r. And I wondered over the Interview with Fred Jarvis June 9, 2009 21years, you know, what was this all about? But cousin Erik came to see us frequently in the camp, and he could have sa \u0152 he had safe passage in and out of the main gate and no one stopped him or challenged him. So I got to thinking, you know, maybe he was acting the part of some Gestapo agent or something, and nobody wanted to mess with him. But actually what he did, he came to visit us in the camp, and his plan was to plan an escape for us. So one dark night, my parents and I and my father\u2122s brother Leopold , and his wife Carrie and his son Kurt, who was a year and a half older than me, we all headed to the back of the camp, and my father gave the French \u0152 the French guard two packs of cigarettes and he turned his back. And we went through the barbed wife, down a short ravine and to a dirt road where my cousin Erik had an automobile and a driver waiting, and we piled into that car. My parents and his brother and his wife and Kurt piled into the back, that was five people, and cousin Erik jumped in front next to the driver, and I jumped in front next to cousin Erik and the door. So that was eight people in \u0152 in a car, I\u2122m sure we were a tight fit. And we took off in the dark of night without lights and my cousin Erik kept barking, ouvrir les lumi\u00e8res, fermer les lumi\u00e8res, meaning open the lights and close the lights, and we drove like that all night long according to what cousin Erik called for, and the driver obeyed him. And we drove for two nights, in the daytim e we hid. And eventually we reached a Interview with Fred Jarvis June 9, 2009 22small town by the name of Caussade, where cousin Erik had picked out a small farm for us to hide in and live. And we had, on this small farm we had, which was on top of a hill, we had one horse, one cow, one dog, chickens, ducks, geese and penned rabbits, which were our dinner. And we grew food, we grew \u0152 grew corn, we grew potatoes, we grew all kinds of vegetables, we grew grapes, and we susubsisted on that farm. And we were on that farm about seven months before all of a sudden, a number of differe nt French police types started to show up. And my parents, seeing them come up the hill from below, ordered me to go lay in the corn field and hide, they shouldn\u2122t count all \u0152 be able to count all of us. And one day there was so many of them that came, that \u0152 and they were stay there so long that I fell asleep in the cornfield, and when they had left, my parents couldn\u2122t find me and they were on a hunt calling Manfred, Manfred, you know on the \u0152 finally I woke up. But soon after that, they came with the German police, the Gestapo, and they rea \u0152 rearrested all of us and sent us back to Camp Rivesaltes. The men were so dangerous, obviously, that within this concentration camp they had another jail. Within the jail they had another jail, and they put the men in my family in that jail. And it was extraordinary and I remember that very well."

So cousin Kurt and I, we had to do the ob \u0152 driving him into town with our horse and wagon, and picking him up in the morning on the daily basis. So that was our contact in the town. We also wa-wandered into town occasionally, and sat along the general park area where men had outdoor restaurants or \u0152 or tables. And we sat among them, we didn\u2122t buy anything to eat, we didn\u2122t have any money. But, we really didn\u2122t talk to them. The only one that talked to any of the local people was cousin Erik. He was very friendly with the local police. And over the years, after they rearrested us and send us back to Camp Rivesaltes, I was always wondering, you know, would cousin Erik have anything to do with getting us rearrested, because he was so friendly with the local police there. I mean, you mind wanders, and you think \u0152 but no, that was not the case, they \u0152 they just tracked us down. And cousin Erik, apparently, I learned many years later, got warning from his friend in the police that the Gestapo was coming Interview with Fred Jarvis June 9, 2009 24to pick us up. And in those days there we re no telephones to call the farm, or any communications, so cousin Erik hightailed it and \u0152 and they \u0152 we got caught. So \u0152 and as I re-revisited Caussade 60 years later, the chief of police told me that Erik had been told that they were coming for us, and that he escaped and \u0152 over the Spanish border, and came back after the wa r.

I had some kind of a chest disease, wher e I was being treated, where they put bottles, heated with cans, and put them on \u0152 on my back. I have no idea what it Interview with Fred Jarvis June 9, 2009 26was, but it must have been pretty bad at the time. And in that hospital they gave me a little bit of milk, which was very difficult to get in \u0152 in the concentration camp. And I was somewhat weak, so I didn\u2122t finish my milk, and I put it at the head of my bed on the floor. And had th is Spanish boy who was also in the hospital, and he made his wa y on my bed, and tried to ssteal that milk. And that was the very first fight that I ever remember being in as a boy. I smacked that boy in the lip, and I said, get out of here, that\u2122s mine. And that\u2122s what I remember of any Spanish boys in there. The Spanish mainly were people who hung around the perimeter of the barbed wire around the outside of the camp, who at times provided food for us, if we had a little money to purchase it, such as perhaps a can of beans, or if you were lu cky, one egg. And \u0152 and nob ody had a lot of money so the-they \u0152 but there were a lot of people there, so they had a ni \u0152 a \u0152 a chance to sell small pieces of fruit to people, a piece of fruit. And people were able to cook it like a boy scout over la \u0152 over a fire made over rocks, and we can put a tin can on the rocks and \u0152 and boil whatever it was. I remember my mother was cooking a can of beans one time over such a rock sy stem, which a \u0152 rather a lot of people were able to do. And I was playing around that, and I knocked that can of beans over, and that was a disaster. And it was \u0152 it was just \u0152 just \u0152 just a disaster. That can of bean would have been a feast for us. Also, these combination of French and Interview with Fred Jarvis June 9, 2009 27Spanish people, since we had no beds to sleep on, we slept on the concrete floor with a little bit of straw under us, if we could find some. They built a primitive wooden beds for someone who had a \u0152 a few cents, I-I have no idea what they sold it for, but they were \u0152 sold quite a few of them, so \u0152 and they were nothing that you would want to sleep on, but for an inmate to sleep off the floor, you know, like 10 inches off the floor rather than on the floor was a \u0152 was a \u0152 just awesome."

It\u2122s where I escaped twice, with my parents and without them, and where I spent a very desperate time of my life. And I never had the money to go back, but I understood no one could go there because the French army had built a rifle range and they \u0152 if you tried to get in there, they\u2122d lock you up. So later on in life, as I was able to accumulate money, I decided I wanted to go back, I want to see first Gurs. Gurs is only \u0152 Gurs \u0152 my grandmother\u2122s grave is in Gurs. The only thing standing of the concentration camp in Gurs at this time is the cemetery. Everything else was planted into a forest. So I went there to see my grandmother\u2122s grave, and as we Jews do, we don\u2122t leave flowers, we leave a stone on the grave. And so I paid my respect there. I wanted to go to Rivesaltes , which it was only a hundred miles away, but couldn\u2122t get in. So instead, I went to Caussade, where we were \u0152 where we were headed on \u0152 hidden on that farm. Came back to the United States and in 19 \u0152 in 2008, I found an article on the internet by the New York Times, that the French government had purchased something like 40 acres of the Rivesaltes Interview with Fred Jarvis June 9, 2009 50concentration camp, and was planning to build, in conjunction with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, a 40 million dollar memorial to the people who went through there. And I wanted to see what this camp looked like today before they built a memorial. So I booked passage over there, and not having spoken French for over 30 years, I was no longer fluent in it, so I hired a driver with an automobile who would speak Fren ch and spoke fluent English. And my travel agent was fortunate to hire such a person for me. I flew to Perpignan , and took a hotel there, and I decided to stay there for eight days, because I didn\u2122t want to spend two days there and not achieve what I came to do, and I brought my \u0152 being a professional photographer, I brought my camera along, and this gentleman knew just the way to the camp, and I was ab le to get in to the camp, and I took between 1500 and 2000 photogr aphs over a period of eight days, I photographed everything that I could find in this conc entration camp, so that I could show myself and my children and my family where I actually was in 1942. That\u2122s why I wanted to go back there."

Several generations of people besides Jews had been put through this camp, including the ar \u0152 Harkis and Gypsies and \u0152 and German war \u0152 World War II prisoners after the war. And there was no street recognizable, everything was in decay, barracks were falling apart, in various stages, which is why I photographed it so intensely. And there was really \u0152 I mean, the camp itself was recognizable as a camp, but there were no actual locations recognizable, no streets, no areas. The ilos(ph) themselves were barely recog \u0152 there was no markings for ilo(ph) E, ilo(ph) B, ilo(ph) A. You couldn\u2122t recognize anything. But I had such a vivid memory of our bathroom system, that I looked for the bathroom, this \u0152 this very \u0152 it was \u0152 had made such a negative impression on me, I\u2122ve \u0152 the smell, the sight, everything.

I couldn\u2122t even find the area where we escaped from, and I looked very \u0152 very hardly for that. So \u0152 but I\u2122m very happy that I went back, that I was able to see what there was, and so I can visualize it and discuss it with my children and Interview with Fred Jarvis June 9, 2009 52family. I\u2122m \u0152 they \u0152 I \u0152 I barely speak of this, but speaking and seeing in a photograph are two different things. A photograph will speak a thousand words to you. So, i-it was \u0152 it was something that I felt I had to do. I also went into Poland , to Auschwitz , to see Auschwitz where my parents were murdered, and photographed everything I could there. And I stood there when it\u2122s \u0152 I saw the sign that \u0152 Arbeit macht frei, and I cried like a baby. Sixty year \u0152 a 70 year old man at that time, crying like a baby.

On the right hand side is his brother Leopold Judas, and in the center is my dear and beloved cousin, Erik Forst(ph). Erik was dressed like a super Nazi or something. He came in and out of that concentration camp like he owned it. And he wore brand new boots, every time he took a step they creaked. And he wore a jacket and pants and shirt and a tie in the concentration camp, and the French beret. He looked like Superman himself."

            "answer": "This is a photograph of Madame Burra in Neyron , France at her small farm. Madame Burra hid Kurt Judas and me during the war, from the Nazis. This is her and her five goats. Kurt and I had to take these goats grazing on alternate days, Kurt one day, I the next. These goats were just such a bother to me because each one wanted to go a different way constantly. But they provided milk for me, and the big one I rode like a horse. Plus, we got to eat one of them at Christmastime. This was life in the fast lane in World War II, Neyron, France, Ain."
