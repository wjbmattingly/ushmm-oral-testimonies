So he, his mother and his sister lived somewhere in France, I do not know where. But all of a sudden he started showing up in Rivesaltes, and he was dressed brilliantly, he was dressed like an undercover Nazi or something. Now what do I mean by that? He was dressed in \u2014 in boots, high thigh boots. He was dir \u2014 dressed in \u2014 in flowery pants, horseback riding type pants. He was dressed in a shirt, and tie and a jacket, and wearing a French beret. And people in concentration camps were just not dressed like that, this was immaculate dressing. So over the years as I got older, I-I\u2019ve always want \u2014I remember every time he took a step that his boots creaked, the leather in his new boots creaked, I remember the sound 65 years later.

But cousin Erik came to see us frequently in the camp, and he could have sa \u2014 he had safe passage in and out of the main gate and no one stopped him or challenged him. So I got to thinking, you know, maybe he was acting the part of some Gestapo agent or something, and nobody wanted to mess with him. But actually what he did, he came to visit us in the camp, and his plan was to plan an escape for us. So one dark night, my parents and I and my father\u2019s brother Leopold, and his wife Carrie and his son Kurt, who was a year and a half older than me, we all headed to the back of the camp, and my father gave the French \u2014 the French guard two packs of cigarettes and he turned his back. And we went through the barbed wife, down a short ravine and to a dirt road where my cousin Erik had an automobile and a driver waiting, and we piled into that car. My parents and his brother and his wife and Kurt piled into the back, that was five people, and cousin Erik jumped in front next to the driver, and I jumped in front next to cousin Erik and the door. So that was eight people in \u2014 in a car, I\u2019m sure we were a tight fit. And we took off in the dark of night without lights and my cousin Erik kept barking, ouvrir les lumi\u00e9res, fermer les lumi\u00e9res, meaning open the lights and close the lights, and we drove like that all night long according to what cousin Erik called for, and the driver obeyed him. And we drove for two nights, in the daytime we hid. And eventually we reached a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And we had, on this small farm we had, which was on top of a hill, we had one horse, one cow, one dog, chickens, ducks, geese and penned rabbits, which were our dinner. And we grew food, we grew \u2014 grew corn, we grew potatoes, we grew all kinds of vegetables, we grew grapes, and we su- subsisted on that farm. And we were on that farm about seven months before all of a sudden, a number of different French police types started to show up. And my parents, seeing them come up the hill from below, ordered me to go lay in the corn field and hide, they shouldn\u2019t count all \u2014 be able to count all of us. And one day there was so many of them that came, that \u2014 and they were stay there so long that I fell asleep in the cornfield, and when they had left, my parents couldn\u2019t find me and they were on a hunt calling Manfred, Manfred, you know on the \u2014 finally I woke up. But soon after that, they came with the German police, the Gestapo, and they rea \u2014 rearrested all of us and sent us back to Camp Rivesaltes. The men were so dangerous, obviously, that within this concentration camp they had another jail. Within the jail they had another jail, and they put the men in my family in that jail.

He was very friendly with the local police. And over the years, after they rearrested us and send us back to Camp Rivesaltes, I was always wondering, you know, would cousin Erik have anything to do with getting us rearrested, because he was so friendly with the local police there. I mean, you mind wanders, and you think \u2014 but no, that was not the case, they \u2014 they just tracked us down.

I had some kind of a chest disease, where I was being treated, where they put bottles, heated with cans, and put them on \u2014 on my back.

And in that hospital they gave me a little bit of milk, which was very difficult to get in \u2014 in the concentration camp. And I was somewhat weak, so I didn\u2019t finish my milk, and I put it at the head of my bed on the floor. And had this Spanish boy who was also in the hospital, and he made his way on my bed, and tried to s-steal that milk. And that was the very first fight that I ever remember being in as a boy. I smacked that boy in the lip, and I said, get out of here, that\u2019s mine. And that\u2019s what I remember of any Spanish boys in there. The Spanish mainly were people who hung around the perimeter of the barbed wire around the outside of the camp, who at times provided food for us, if we had a little money to purchase it, such as perhaps a can of beans, or if you were lucky, one egg. And \u2014 and nobody had a lot of money so the-they \u2014 but there were a lot of people there, so they had a ni \u2014 a\u2014a chance to sell small pieces of fruit to people, a piece of fruit. And people were able to cook it like a boy scout over la \u2014 over a fire made over rocks, and we can put a tin can on the rocks and \u2014 and boil whatever it was. I remember my mother was cooking a can of beans one time over such a rock system, which a \u2014 rather a lot of people were able to do. And I was playing around that, and I knocked that can of beans over, and that was a disaster. And it was \u2014 it was just \u2014 just \u2014 just a disaster.

And I wanted to see what this camp looked like today before they built a memorial.
