Yeah, actually, it must\u2019ve been already \u00b038 after the Anschluss in \u201938. I must\u2019ve been about eight. She came especially from Riga after coming back from Vienna to Riga, she came especially to Libau. She said she 1s going to make from me Viennese sandwiches, and anything along those lines was of interest to me, and when she served me on the little piece of bread, piece of Wienerschnitzel or whatever, I said, \u201cWell, I know what this is. It doesn\u2019t interest me.\u201d So, finally, my mother asked, \u201cWhat would interest you?\u201d And, I said, \u201cI would love to go to Hotel Petersburg, and eat over there.\u201d That was a hotel in Libau, and had also a beautiful restaurant, also was private rooms, et cetera, and she would take me there late in the afternoon about five, five-thirty or six, and I would always have my cocoa there, hot chocolate, and little sandwiches with hard boiled egg on top of it, a small piece of tomato, and anchovies, and whatever I \u2014 whenever I would get it I would sort of put it into the cocoa, into the hot chocolate and eat it. It was what I loved, but everything \u2014 with anchovies with everything. Some people complained actually, and the manager of the hotel came and said to my mother, \u201cMrs. Dr. Schwab\u201d, that\u2019s the way we used to address people, \u201cThere\u2019s some people who object to seeing your son put everything into the hot chocolate and eat it then.\u201d So, we were given a separate room, and for six months, I did this, and then I started eating again. I had some sort of disorder, whatever it was, I don\u2019t know, but for about six months, we went almost every single day to the Hotel Petersburg in Libau, and that\u2019s how I ate, and also I continued at home to put everything into hot chocolate. Hot chocolate, whatever I had was hot chocolate sandwiches."

I don\u2019t know to what extent he knew what to do or didn\u2019t know because in those days, actually, if a father was a physician, he was not permitted to treat his son. You had to go to someone else, and the pediatrician, my pediatrician, was a man by the name of Dr. Rabinovitz, who was the father of the head of \u2014 later on \u2014 the head of intelligence in Israel, , and whose nephew was the Israeli Ambassador here, Rabinovitz in Washington. They all come from Libau, and the father, Dr. Rabinovitz was my pediatrician. So, I don\u2019t remember if I was taken to him for this or they just spoke over the telephone or what.

We used the French word in German, jargon. And, language 1s something that one has to be in command of. So, the first language was really German that we spoke. When I was small and my parents didn\u2019t want me to understand something, they spoke Russian which, of course, bothered me. So, I picked it up because I heard Russian being spoken all over the place. I went to Latvian school, and Latvian school of course we spoke Latvian. Our main housekeeper, we spoke Latvian. When we had another one, Fenya, she was Russian, and then my father in the building had a nurse, Maria. With her, I spoke German. So, I grew up with all these languages, but my language number one was German. Two, I would say, was probably Latvian at that time. Three, Russian, and English four, because I really liked it, and I made a point of really getting it under my belt."

Everyone had to take in Russian soldiers because Libau was a major base for the Russians, and Libau had three ports that never froze in the winters and that\u2019s why you had also a very big naval port in Libau where part of the Russian fleet was stationed. So, it was very strategic significance. Libau as a city, and that is probably why Libau was much bombarded by the Nazis in \u201941 when they invaded, and in \u201944 and \u201945 \u2014 and there was a lot of fighting in and around the city, and the city was about at least 85 percent destroyed in contrast to Riga which was not a strategic site, and there was relatively little fighting, and the city, by and large was preserved, is preserved."

He came, but sometimes drunk, had very curious habits, not washing himself, but spraying himself with a kind of an autocologne that smelled terribly, but this was common apparently among the Russian soldiers. Different culture- different habits, et cetera, and people used to laugh. I remember my parents \u2014 the Russians loved music, and they would go to the opera, an in those days when you went to the opera very often you put on a tuxedo and long dress so on and so forth. So, the Russians wanted to show how well they can dress. So, some of the women \u2014 the wives of the officers came in long nightgowns."

A little footnote about this. I was persuaded by \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the name means anything \u2014 Per Ahlmark, Per Ahlmark former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, played a very big role in Jewish life since the \u201870s, \u201880s \u2014 very pro-Israel, very pro-Jewish, convinced Elie to go back tos and accompanied Elie to \u2014_ and wrote about it for the Swedish press. It was he who persuaded me to go back and accompanied me too, and wrote a series of articles in the Swedish press about my return to Libau. Before we went into any of my apartments where I lived in Riga and Libau in 1990. We had the President\u2019s car and one his \u2014 another one his drivers, and also one of his deputies so we could get into any apartment. I said, \u201cPer, before we go into any of these apartments, from the outside I will tell you exactly the layout so you will not think that I\u2019m imaging or inventing certain things.\u201d Later on he told me, \u201cGeorge, I\u2019ve never seen anybody who has such a memory\u201d, because I was precise on every single issue. For example, before I went into the apartment, I said to him, \u201cWe had central heating.\u201d You see? And, I told him exactly where it is, and I showed it to him which was still preserved. In Riga too where I used to stay with my aunt in a very luxurious, large apartments. At that time in 1990, my aunts, she was the only person. She had an atrium apartment. There were about three or four families living, and I showed him in the room where I used to sleep, et cetera, dining room, living room, sitting room, library, et cetera. He said, \u201cYou know this memory\u2019s absolutely\u201d because, I found \u2014 everything I found to be fascinating, the big world. Now, I heard these talks about when my parents talked when they were in Paris and Berlin and went to the cabarets, this and that. That\u2019s what I wanted to do, and my aunt with whom I stayed, she was married to the Chinese envoy to Germany who died in 1935. Whose father was already ambassador in the days of Bismarck, the Germany, and when she would talk \u2014and so I always thought of foreign policy. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but the lifestyle, I just loved it. I ate it all up, et cetera. The diplomatic life, what my mother would tell me about when they were in Berlin in the \u201820s, what was going on so on and so forth. For example, my mother loved to go in the subways. She said, \u201cI came here in order to see Berlin.\u201d My father had lived in Berlin because he had studied there. \u201cI want to see Berlin. I go by bus.\u201d My aunt said, \u201cBut you have my car with a driver. What\u2019s the matter with you, Clara?\u201d My mother said, \u201cNo, I am going to go in the subway. I am going to go in the elevator. I\u2019m going to go in the buses. I want\u201d She looked at her as if she was crazy, and it turned out later on, and my aunt told me that my mother knew Berlin better than she knew it."

And, we were able to exchange some of it into Rubles, but there were price controls in the Russian period. So, if you made 30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe with three Rubles or four Rubles, but money was not an issue and wasn\u2019t \u2014 and I remember the snickers about the 30 Rubles that he was making, or 35 Rubles perhaps, but it was very low.

Saturday night, my parents went to sleep only at three or four because they played cards at our house. There were about six or seven ladies played Gin Rummy, I mean Kunken, and suddenly early in the morning, there was lots of noise, bombs being dropped et cetera on that Sunday morning, June 22\", of \u2019\u00b041, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a balcony not a terrace, actually only a balcony. And, we all went out to see what happened, and we saw German planes, , flying very low where we could even say hello to the pilots and they sort of winked back at us because it was very low, bombing certain parts. We didn\u2019t know what was happening. We turned on the radio, no news. The news about the outbreak of the war did not come for hours because the Russians were taken by surprise. They didn\u2019t know. Subsequently, I read in the history books that Stalin thought that 1t was not Hitler behind this, the went behind Hitler\u2019s back because Stalin and Molotov were convinced that the Germans were not going to invade, and now suddenly, they did invade. So, the bombings \u2014 this was very exciting. Again, our building was not hit. It was someplace in the center of the city. I did not immediately see any ruins, but as the Germans were moving closer, they occupied Libau one week after the outbreak of the war. My father took us to the hospital which was a little bit outside of the city in a safer neighborhood, and we stayed there for a couple of days until the Germans came in. But, during the bombardment, we also stayed one night in a basement in the center of the city in a kind of a policlinic, a small hospital, and there I saw a lot of the destruction already, and that became to dangerous to stay there in the center of the city because this was being bombarded by the German Navy and subsequently by the Army. So, we moved to the larger hospital outside the city \u2014 well, it still was in the city district, but in the residential area right near the beach, and I distinctly remember when the Germans arrived, the Latvian doctors asked my father to accompany them to \u201cwelcome the Germans\u201d with roses, et cetera, and my father went and asked about the Jews and the Lieutenant in the car, and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing to worry about. We now have a common foe, and we must fight this common foe and the Jews are part of this war. In the naivety, fighting if you fight together we\u2019re civilized Germans, not racists, et cetera. Like in World War I, if you fight Communism, fine and good, and he was sort of assured, and in a certain naivety, he believed and made us rather believe that we have nothing to worry about, or maybe he just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case."

            "question": "So, your mother has a couple of jobs, and are you still living in that smaller apartment?",
            "answer": "No, in the meantime, several times we had to move. We moved in to one apartment near my school for a short time. Let me get the sequence straight. Oh, my \u2014 we moved into the servant quarters of the Kessel Villa, K-e-s-s-e-l, because my brother married the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the best of my knowledge. So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the villa was occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. Her husband was Jewish. So, she lived there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel\u2019s \u2014 the husband was already killed, Mrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived behind the building what used to be known as the servant\u2019s quarters. We lived there for a while until we had to move from there and moved to another quarter which was near my school where we were in three rooms \u2014 one, two, three. We were one \u2014 my brother and his newly acquired wife, myself \u2014 we lived, slept in one room. My mother slept in another room, another woman \u2014 Mrs. Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs. Boop\u2019s apartment. Yes, she was killed during the war, and two young women slept in another room. So we were about six or seven people in this small apartment of about four or five rooms, excluding the kitchen. And, from there, well an announcement came that we will be moved to a ghetto \u2014 we\u2019ll have to move to a ghetto which is in a part of Libau, a section of Libau that I did not know very well, and there in the ghetto this was in the summer of \u201943, we were assigned to a flat in a basement that had a kind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few steps \u2014 we had to go about five or six steps, right off the entrance, rear entrance of the building, and there including the kitchen there were one, two, three rooms. So, two rooms and where people could sleep. In these two rooms, my brother and his wife, and my mother and I slept, in this basement apartment, and in the other room there were about four people who slept, and we shared the same toilet. We shared the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we made the best of this situation. I was working for a while in the ghetto in the garden, vegetable garden, and then I was \u201casked, invited\u201d to become the commandant\u2019s runner in the Libau ghetto. The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher. He closed his eyes to many things especially when people brought 1n some extra food to the ghetto. He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the war who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to him, and this reminds me even before we moved into the ghetto, there were collections of gold coins. This in order to try to release Jews from the prison to bribe the Germans, et cetera. So, this was \u2014 I remember people coming around for specific arrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and this and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of prison and so on and so forth. But, this brings me back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto. Immediately after the revolution in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up the palaces. You could buy everything and anything for very little money. And, we had antique \u2014 an antique for example living room that came from one of the Czarist palaces. We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia, and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia. So, in addition to the Persian carpets and the Grand piano, et cetera, this was very exclusive furniture that we had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers. I remember two in particular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the ghetto. And, not only the German , but also the German Navy. There was a certain Inspector Ulmann of the German Navy. Incidentally, the old \u2014 where we lived before World War I, the building that became the headquarters of the Communist Party during World War II became the headquarters of the German Navy for the region, and this Inspector Ulmann came very often to our apartment, and with a crew would take a lot of the things from the apartment, and then of course, we also had people from the \u2014__s coming with their crews to take, and there was one guy fromthe by the name of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was a collector of stamps, and my late brother had a huge stamp collection and he traded stamps with all over the world. There was actually an exhibition here in Philadelphia in memoriam for my brother, a big stamp collection, where it is all described and I have a photograph with my late mother, still. She was already sick and we went to Philadelphia. This must have be in 1963, when there was this big exhibition in Philadelphia. And, he took, and I\u2019m sure he took it for himself because he was an art collector, and then we had to two Leica cameras, one German and one Russian Leica, I remember, and we gave one of them to one of the Latvians who came to the house to look for things. I think, and I would have to establish this, I\u2019m not sure, but one of the Latvians was a notorious murderer by the name of Cukurs. He had several fingers missing. I don\u2019t know how come, but I remember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name Cukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the famous Arias, commander of Latvians who killed Jews with a vengeance. And, this man with the fingers came and looked for things, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the Leicas because we had two still hidden in the apartment. This is when we were still living in the apartment to which we moved during the Russian period."

This I don\u2019t know. Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one because it was not sold until the late \u201830s, the other one. So, maybe the first one they didn\u2019t bother talking about. But, I did not know until I heard about it over here that there was a second one. Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over here is that when the governor of St. Petersburg came to Libau, he would always come to Libau and play bridge with my grandfather, and they were very good friends, but I would think that the big money came from my grandfather.

I don\u2019t know if this played a role, but in addition to being a runner for him - when I would have to, when I would get a pass that nothing should happen to me while I brng a watch which was repaired in the ghetto to, let\u2019s say to or to SS who was the head of the SS in Libau or to Inspector of the .

Later on, I met types I never met before, but in Libau, I had not met types, such types before. So, among ourselves, we were very polite. We were very well behaved to the best of our ability, and this goes also for the \u201cless fortunate\u201d people because I think that even the less fortunate people before the war, there was a common level of behavior that embraced the, I would say, what I knew of the Jewish community, but as I proven wrong about saying that there were no poor Jews in Latvia, maybe I just didn\u2019t was not in touch with other elements. But, after the war and during the war when I spent with many of them from many other levels, I would say that there was very civilized and \u2014 under the worse circumstances- civilized and cultured approach to things, to human beings, to fellow human beings, et cetera. You rarely heard of a Libau Jew stealing something from another Libau Jew, rarely. There were exceptions, and they were caught ant they were punished.

The the commotion in Riga, it was a big city for me in contrast to Libau which was sort of a sleepy, smaller city of some 70,000 inhabitants. Riga at that time had close to half a million people. It was the city of my dreams as a child. So, I imagined Riga when I was being transported, I was thinking of the Riga beaches, the summers we spent there. I was thinking of my aunt\u2019s apartment, the parties. I was thinking of the cafes, of the Riga Zoo, wonderful, wonderful memories. And, then we were told we were coming to Kaiserwald. Kaiserwald was the most exclusive suburb in Riga at this time. Kaiserwald means the Forest of the Kaiser. And, one of my aunts and my granddad had a beautiful villa there, Kaiserwald, gorgeous. So, I thought, \u201cKaiserwald, well, who knows?\u201d et cetera. In a sense, I mean, obviously here we were in a cattle car, and at the same time I was daydreaming about the beautiful life that I lived in Riga. (laughs)"

So, we were very warmly dressed. We each had a suitcase and some other things so on and so forth. So, we were transported, and I remember we arrived in Riga. It was still dark, probably very early in the morning next day. Suddenly, the doors were slid open. SS men beginning to scream and also some of the non-Jewish prisoners in very strange garb, namely in concentration camp garb screaming, \u201cOut, out with you dirty Jews, out!\u201d And, beating us, beating us like crazy, and then we had to run from \u2014 which wasn\u2019t very far, maybe fifty or sixty yards \u2014 to the camp from the railroad track. And, there we were told to throw all the luggage and to take off the coat, and throw it on a pile, and my mother didn\u2019t want to do it, and I remember saying to my mother, \u201cBut, mother we\u2019re told that we\u2019re going to get it back. So, let\u2019s put it there.\u201d What do you expect of an eleven year old kid? That\u2019s what we were told, and I believed. So, reluctantly, my mother and my brother also took off the coat, and inside of course, were diamonds and some gold coins whatever. And, needless to say, we never saw the coats again. Then we were chased into a barrack, and next day, we were \u2018\u201cdeloused\u201d but we didn\u2019t have any lice in Libau, and we went through a shower, and coming out of the shower, we no longer had our old clothes. We were given new clothes that didn\u2019t fit me. I got a coat that came down to here. I received some wooden shoes. What do they call them?"

I\u2019d never seen before bunk beds with straw mattresses and straw pillow, and at night I remember, the straw would come out and it was very \u2014 there were no sheets or anything of the sort, a kind of a blanket even in the winter. It was very cold which as an ordeal especially for me who \u2014 for everyone who had not experienced anything of the sort because until then, let\u2019s put it this way, in comparison to the Libau ghetto, Riga was \u2014 Riga Kaiserwald was hell, and the Libau ghetto was, in comparison, paradise. The beatings, the screamings, Appel, for the first time I heard the word Appel, the count, in the morning, and to make sure that I look older, et cetera, at the count, I always scratched together the sand and stood on my toes to be taller than usual. So, and I was a little bit taller than the rest of the kids in my age group. That was probably one of the reasons why I was not immediately selected for being shot. My brother after a few days was taken to a kaisernierung, to a camp outside the camp where he worked in their reichsbarn which had happened to be a very good kaisernierung. The people were treated relatively well. My mother was assigned to a job in the concentration camp, in the tanklager, and sometimes she managed to convince, I don\u2019t know how that I go with her to the tanklager, not to remain in camp because if you remain in camp you never know what can happen. There were safer days. There were less safer days.

I said, \u201cBut, did you eat?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I am full.\u201d She would say, but she was not, but she threw me her portion because in the mornings we would receive moldy bread, some sugar, some kind of a marmalade, and this was very bad because \u2014 this was bad because we all got diarrhea from it, and a kind of a coffee that didn\u2019t taste like coffee at least to me as a child. It was terrible, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me. So, I asked my mother, and she very often was able to throw me her portion, and I ate, and I remember at that time, there was a Mr. Kaufman who was a friend from before the war. And, I went to him and I said to him in German, \u201cMr. Kaufman, do you happen to have a slice of bread? I\u2019m very, very hungry.\u201d He said to me, \u201cGeorge, I wish I had I could give you, but I don\u2019t.\u201d And, Pll never forget this. He died in New York. He was the first chairman of the Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he always remembered this, and I remember this particular incident as well. But, it was done still. It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr. Kaufman that I addressed him. It was not Max or sort of the way we\u2019re accustomed to here. Yes, and then, interestingly enough in this Tanklager, which was a tough place, there was a German guard by the name of Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat the Jews like anything. He came I think from Romania or some place from that area, but he liked my mother, and would always address her as Frau Dr. Schwab, and when he was patrolling, he would say, \u201cYou can go into this shack\u201d where there was a stove and what we confiscated. We used to call it organizier, we organized something. We stole something \u2014 potatoes so we could slice and put it against the oven and roast potatoes. That became a delicacy. So, and he permitted me to go with my mother. So, we could go in. We could warm-up, et cetera. We would have our potato so on and so forth. One day, we were marching toward the Tanklager again in the winter, and my mother told me she had a terrible case of diarrhea and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. in German. She went over to him and said, \u201cI really have to step out.\u201d He said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d He slowed down the column, permitted my mother to attend to what she had, and then she rejoined the column. Why did he do it? I don\u2019t know. My mother was gold blonde, very fair skinned, bluish-grey eyes, looked like a thousand Aryans. Actually, she was told and that was still going back now in Libau, if she wanted to be saved to be taken to Germany, she could be saved. She said, \u201cI\u2019Il be delighted if I can bring my sons with me.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, you can not.\u201d Then, she said, \u201cThen I stay with my sons.\u201d And, that was still in Libau, because they distinguished sometimes the genotype from the phenotype, genetically Jewish versus the appearance, and if your appearance was \u201cAryan\u201d especially Nordic, which my mother was, then you could manipulate, but she was actually asked."

It was something in because certain of the things we managed to give to a Latvian patient of my father\u2019s who was a head of a bank by the name of Abelit. His name was Abelit, and he did come through, this Abelit, and sent the things to Kohler and Kohler instructed my brother to get a message to me that I should be in the camp on those three days and he will send a car for me.

He was one who could be bribed. And, then my mother, we learned later, also went to an out camp to work camp called the SS , the SS vegetable garden for the SS et cetera.

And, a colleague of my father\u2019s, Dr. Sik in Libau was the head of the hospital over there. He said, \u201cGeorge, I'll take you into the hospital.\u201d And, he kept me there.

We were being evacuated, boarded the ship. That\u2019s when we were taken to Stutthof in August 1944. And, it was a, I guess a troop carrier, what, I don\u2019t remember what it was before the war. Maybe it was a liner or so, but at that stage of the game there were bunks all over the place, troop carrier, I guess. It was full of concentration camp inmates. So, I was looking.

Columns was a wooden \u201cbench\u201d maybe six or eight inches and you would have to lift yourself up, that I never fell into the pit was a miracle, and incidentally, there were some kapos that were so bad that they were thrown into the pit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples.

Yes, I was emaciated, but everyone was emaciated, and however much I suffered from hunger pains, I suffered less than others because my father as a gastroenterologist, et cetera never permitted us to eat huge portions of anything, never permitted us too much, too many of the fatty things. In between meals, we could have a fruit or something. He was strict about that \u2014 a fruit or so, but no as we would call it, maybe a piece of this or that, et cetera nothing. A meal is a meal.

            "answer": "The food was manageable over there, and people who worked right near the tracks were able to organize sometimes potatoes, carrots, because they would fall off from the railroad tracks and smuggled into the camps and you could begin to trade a little bit here and there. So, you could augment the poor food that we got with some of the extras, but a few months later, some people did the same thing, organize some food, and they were caught by the Germans. And, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a lesson that theft 1s punishable. And, what they did was hang the people, and we were forced to march to see the hanging, and then march around the hangers to see them. How did I survive this one? When it was announced hanging people, I didn\u2019t understand what it means, how a person can hang. Again, it became interesting to me to look at the person hanging. I didn\u2019t understand that this is involved with death. I did not put two and two together. How can a person hang? And, only while hanging did I realize that the person was hanged and it meant actual death. I did not connect this before. So, to me again, it was a kind of a spectacle. Theater of the Absurd, if you want to call it, or something along those lines. Sick! But I remember the context very well because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted? And, my answer 1s, folly of youth, did not understand, and number two, and perhaps even more important than this, curiosity because everything interested me especially that what I didn\u2019t understand. And, this happened three, four months before our liberation when the Russians were already on German soil, and also during this period in Stolp, the German Jewish couples began to behave atrociously to the Eastern European Jews. When somebody was caught organizing something internally or so, he had to receive twenty lashes, and the German Jewish couples were only delighted to mete out the punishment. One of them was Kentcourik who was particularly brutal. For some reason or other, both of these couples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me, maybe because I spoke their type of German, and left me pretty much alone this and that and were actually nice, but they were absolute \u2014 excuse me for using the term here \u2014 bastards. And, I\u2019m jumping now forward for a minute. I was in the same hospital, after, right after the war as Kentcourik, and I came out of the hospital and was brought back by the British to the rehabilitation, to the rehabilitation barrack in the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein with one of the British Red Cross cars, ambulance cars, and Kentcourik \u2014 I informed the other guys who were there, fellows, many of them that I was liberated with that Kentcourik was coming out. \u201cOh, Kentcourik is coming out. We\u2019ll beat the hell out of him,\u201d and Kentcourik came in thinking that\u2019s he\u2019s coming 1n as a great hero, and chairs flew into his face, this and that, so on and so forth. He was taken back to the hospital seriously injured. He survived this, and after the war he had two daughters, moved with his two daughters to Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don\u2019t remember what happened to his other one, Grunwald, but that was the fate of this German Jewish couple Kentcourik."

His feet swelled up, and we were there for about two weeks, maybe a little longer give or take a week or so when suddenly the order came, \u201cEvacuation.\u201d We\u2019re going to be evacuated by boat. And, again, we were hauled off in these mini-train, these mini-railroad tracks, not the regular ones to barges in Danzig, or near Danzig, barges. And, then we were taken on these barges on the high seas \u2014 the Baltic, the North Sea. For the trip, we received a loaf of bread and some water. That was it because we subsisted on sea water during the trip, salt water. SS Guards were guarding us, and if you had to step out, you had to do it over the railing and into the water on these barges, and you could see the SS Guards pushing people with their shoes into the Baltic or into the North Sea. I remember very distinctly I suddenly saw a German coming, passing me. I thought, well, this was my end, but it passed me and didn\u2019t do anything. And, we were down, et cetera. To climb up we had no strength left or anything of the sort, but Julius despite his illness, I mean he was as strong as a bull. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my life.

He said, \u201cNope, you\u2019re coming with me\u2019, and took me by the collar and dragged me. We had to go down, and actually in this very cold May in the North Sea, early morning, and I knew a little bit how to swim from the Baltic. I grew up on the shores of the Baltic. I knew, et cetera, but I had no difficulties wading to shore, and we all lined up and people took a long time because there were several barges of people, and there were people still there who didn\u2019t want to leave, and left very slowly, and suddenly, units of the German Navy arrive because it turned out that this was a U-boat school in Neustadt in Holstein, a huge U-boat school.

And, the march was not a long one, a couple of miles, and we arrived at this huge complex, a German U-boat school. There was a huge soccer field, and there were thousands and thousands of people there from other camps.

And, some way or other, I saw Julius again, and I saw people stealing goods from the German storage places, food. They had huge gallons of marmalade, I guess for the soldiers, for the Naval people whatever, and people hauling, people eating all over. Many died by overeating immediately."

And, that\u2019s where we decided we\u2019re going to be for the night, and we were basically free, but it didn\u2019t mean anything to me being free. I did receive some crackers, something else, et cetera. So, my basic hunger was to an extent satiated, and then I went out myself and I organized something also one of those cans I managed to bring back. Suddenly, there\u2019s a knock on the door and several Poles walked in, looked around, and said among themselves, and by then I knew some Polish because I lived with Poles at the camps, \u201cThis is our place and out you Jew! Out! You out!\u201d He didn\u2019t say Jews, and the Jews said, \u201cYou better get out or else.\u201d And, Julius was in the forefront as sick as he was. Those days are over. They left quietly, and we stayed there. Now, while we were still on the barges, we heard the best news of all that Hitler was killed fighting the Russians. He was killed in Berlin. It was very, very late April. It must have been about the 29\" or 30\" of April, just a few days before we were liberated. We were liberated on the third of May by the British. And, the day Germany officially capitulated, I collapsed out of total weakness and I was taken to the hospital in Neustadt in Holstein. The many, many other prisoners from Libau, from Riga, from German Jews that I met subsequently, Czech Jews, so on and so forth were all there, and I stayed for a good number of weeks. I think four or six weeks I stayed there."

Before I go to the Warburg Estate, a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying to convince me to go back to Latvia, go back to Latvia, go back to the Soviet Union, et cetera. The answer \u2014 my answer was a categorical no because we made a pact, a family, never go east, go back. You go. We have relatives in England, the United States, and we\u2019re given a name so on and so forth to remember, but never go back, and I said, \u201cCategorically, I\u2019m not going back.\u201d The British officers still tried to convince me to go back, and a good number did go back. Some of them are now in Israel. After horror \u2014 after spending horrible times in the Soviet Union in Latvia until the \u201870s, and I refused to go back. Then, the Brits became suspicious of me that I wasn\u2019t Jewish, despite the fact that I\u2019m circumcised, and put me, brought me, took me to a Latvian children\u2019s home where only Latvian was spoken, where some of the leaders were former patients of my father, where they talked about Tievzeme in Latvian, the Fatherland, how eventually we\u2019ll all go back to the Fatherland, et cetera, but this was a little bit strange to me because we had Latvian guards. Some of the Latvians were innocuous. Others were horrible. I believe this guy Cukurs, especially Cukurs. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable there. They also wanted to introduce me \u2014 they had with a woman. This was in . She wanted to introduce me to General Dankers who apparently knew my father. General Dankers was one of the sympathizers, Nazi sympathizers who managed to get to Lubek. He headed Latvian troops, so on and so forth. But, which I did not know exactly, but General Dankers just didn\u2019t sound right that I should meet him. In Lubek, she wanted to take me because apparently he knew my father, but when we needed the Latvians, they didn\u2019t come through those who were in the position to come through. One day, when the head, this woman, went to Lubek for a day or so, I decided to run away, and I ran away and I ran all the way to the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein. the DP Camp.\u201d But, this was a second time around, not the first time. The first time I was brought back to the \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. This was the second time around because the first time after a few days I had a relapse, and I was taken back to the hospital for another twelve days. The second time, it was when they took me to the Latvian children\u2019s home, and after a few weeks, I ran away. I came to the camp which was in this U-boat school, and I went to the bunk where I had originally brought back, the rehabilitation bunk, and I\u2019ve got a bed so on and so forth, and what were the people doing? Playing poker. Playing poker. Playing \u2014 what you call it? They call 1t 21? \u2014 Blackjack, blackjack, and making piles of money. In those days, the exchange rate was one dollar to 600 Marks, and I don\u2019t know how I got a few Marks to play also. I figured, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And, I had a very good memory, and after a few days, I saw this and I knew every card that had gone out and so on and so forth. I began to play, and I piled in tens of thousands of Marks which translates into dollars, maybe it was twenty or twenty-five dollars, but in Marks, it sounded enormous amount, and then I decided that it\u2019s time for me to see the world."

I went to Hamburg, and I remembered going to a police station saying, \u201cI looked for so and so.\u201d I spoke German, and I didn\u2019t know. So, I was taken to the Warburg Estate in , a Suburb of Hamburg which the Warburg family had temporarily given over to \u2014 I guess there\u2019s a joint distribution committee of the American Relief Unit to turn it into a children\u2019s home, just a small children\u2019s home. I arrived there, and I was told, \u201cYes, I belong there.\u201d So, that\u2019s how I arrived. It must have been late summer or early fall. I remember a few weeks later, getting an attack, appendix attack. I was operated on. I was all alone. I was scared, in the Altona Hospital in Hamburg. I spoke German. I told them that my father was a gastroenterologist. I spoke German to them. They were very nice to me, but I was still very much afraid. They were Germans. You don\u2019t know what they can do to me. I thought at that time, and I always reacted very poorly to ether, and I remember throwing off the mask in those days, but before the war my tonsils were removed also under ether and I reacted very poorly in Riga, and I threw off the mask, which I did again, but next thing I knew I came out of the operation all right. I stayed for a number of days in the hospital. When I was brought back for further recovery to the estate. Now came the issue \u2014 there were several issues. First of all, to find mother, and then I wanted to go to Palestine because there were people from the Jewish Brigade in uniform and out of uniform, legally and illegally, Hamburg to train us. Not only to teach us Hebrew, the history of Israel, the history of Palestine, Jewish History, also Hebrew, mathematics, so on and so forth, but prepare also for Aliyjah Bet which was illegal immigration. And, the war to an extent, it\u2019s only in retrospect that radicalized me. Why did I suffer? I suffered because I\u2019m a Jew. Is there anything really to be ashamed of being a Jew? No, I was ashamed when I met the girl that I fancied on the street, and, you know, shame came over me that I could not really talk and I really felt inferior which I never did before. But, this was a kind of a reaction I guess to my timidity at the time to having felt ashamed that I reacted the way I did, and was prepared to go to Palestine, prepared to take up a gun against the British because they were so horrible also to the Jews not permitting the Jews to come in, giving maybe 1,500 certificates a month, and there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands and Jews who wanted to move to Palestine, so on and so forth, but this comes a little later. When it\u2019s all started, and my mother and brother, especially my mother said, \u201cYou go west, never go east.\u201d You must remember your relatives in America, and in England. In London, remember your Uncle Robert, Robert Schwab. I said, \u201cYes, of course. He visited us in Libau. I remember him well.\u2019\u201d\u2019 Remember to write simply Robert Schwab, Director Shell Oil, London, England it will arrive because he was one of the heads of Shell Oil, but I had forgotten that he was the director of Shell Oil. So, I wrote, \u201cRobert Schwab, London, England.\u201d It all went through military mail because you could not write. It went through the Joint Distribution Committee. It never arrived. To my cousin in Salt Lake City, I wrote, \u201cMr. David Alder.\u201d He was married to my cousin Anna Alder, who\u2019s in this photograph who went to America, and there I wrote to Mr. David Alder, Director Shell Oil, but he was not Director of Shell Oil, and it arrived to the local manager of Shell Oil in Salt Lake City, letter after letter. He disregarded it, but one day he decided to look up in the phone book in Salt Lake City who this David Alder was. It turned out that he was the owner of an insurance company in Salt Lake City, David Alder Insurance Company. So, he called David Alder and asked him, \u201cDoes the name George Schwab mean anything to you?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, he is my wife\u2019s cousin.\u201d So, this was a first contact. I wrote to my other cousin in West Hartford, Broskin, it never arrived because it was just Dr. and Mrs. Broskin, Hartford, Connecticut. It never arrived. But, this man, this one man, immediately contacted my uncle in London and contacted his sister, his wife\u2019s sister in Hartford, Connecticut. So, they were already now in touch, but my mother knew to write the correct. So, she independently got in touch, and this way we connected. We were able to speak on the phone, on the military phone once a week."

Then, she heard later on in May or June that there are a lot of Jews in Lodz, and maybe I am one of those who she could find in Lodz or get some information. Turns out that she arrives in Lodz, gets off a trolley car and somebody says, \u201cFrau Dr. Schwab in German. Frau Dr. Schwab. Frau Dr. Schwab.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, who was it?\u201d It\u2019s is Mrs. Dorbian the son comes now several times had come to Latvia. He\u2019s my age. We were together in . It was his mother. \u201cDo you know that George is alive in the British zone?\u201d She didn\u2019t ask, \u201cWhere? When?\u201d She was so overwhelmed, she ran back to Lauenburg, picked up her few things that she had, and went to Berlin almost penniless, comes to Berlin and Berlin was a second home to her because she had been very often to Berlin before the war especially in the \u201820s and early \u201830s. And, decided she was going to go to the Joint Distribution Committee. She went to the Joint Distribution Committee. They wanted to test her, \u201cWho is she?\u201d She didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. She looked like a thousand percent Aryan. So, they were suspicious because many wanted to do things, and she got away with no results, but she went back to the Joint several times, and then there was a woman who said to her, \u201cYou know Mrs. Schwab, I believe your story. I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d And, with the help of this person, she was able to write to the United States because again, everything had to go through military mail, and through them she found out where I am which the Joint was able to connect me then by telephone to my mother because the Warburgs, the Joint Distribution Committee and the American and the English Relief Unit were sort of the heads of the so-called children\u2019s home in the Warburg estate, were able to connect once a week. My mother went to the Joint in Berlin, and I was, of course at the Warburg Estate, and it was pre- arranged what time we would be talking. So, we started to talk, and in those days, it was not easy to go from Hamburg from the British zone to Berlin because you had to go to the British Sector or the American sector because we had to go by way of the Soviet zone, and it took months before I was brought to Berlin. But, in the meantime, when my relatives found out that I was alive, they started bombarding me with packages and money, and every single letter was five dollars, ten dollars, twenty dollars. Sometimes I received a package a day. I didn\u2019t know what to do with cigarettes and coffee, but they wrote me they coffee and the cigarettes are not for you, but we\u2019ve been led to understand that there\u2019s a lot you can do with it in Germany. So, that\u2019s for that purpose. Now, it may sound very funny, but it\u2019s true. I felt that I was now an independent young man. I\u2019ve gone through the camps. I\u2019m going to live the life of my parents, aunts and uncles. I am rich. I have now all this coffee, et cetera, and among other things, I managed to get myself a driver with his car. He came to the Warburg Estate. He always picked me up whenever I needed or wanted. I had my wine table in the Alhambra in the , It was a kind of a red light district I went to in the evenings. For two cigarettes, I could get it at my age because it was my card I\u2019 dentitie. End of Tape 9 Tape 10"

It was a novel written by, I forget the author\u2019s name, \u201csmall man, what now?\u201d In other words, looking at it in today\u2019s terms, at that time, I didn\u2019t know about the author nor about the novel Kleiner Mann Was Nun, and I in the evenings were not really supervised as much at the Warburg Estate. As long as we were there in the morning for hitamulut is what they called it in Hebrew, the exercises, callisthenic exercises, appearing in class, doing some homework. We didn\u2019t take studies very seriously. Much more interesting was when we learned a little about how to smuggle arms, and this and preparing for Aliyah Bet, not to sit with this dry stuff mathematics or, so, who needed it. Anyways, in the meantime, Julius Goldberg met up with his wife. She was liberated in Cologne \u2014 in Kiel, sorry, in Kiel. And, she was in one of the barges that didn\u2019t come to Neustadt in Holstein but went to Kiel. And, then he became Norbert Wollheim\u2019s driver. Norbert Wollheim became the head of the Jews of the British Zone. And, Norbert was headquartered in Lubek, Germany, and Julius would drive him when he had to go to Kiel, to Hamburg, orto _. So, usually when Julius had to drive himto _, he had to go by way of Hamburg. So, Julius would come to swith Wollheim, pick me up, take me to to the DP camp where I met Yosele for the first time, Yosele Rosensaft, Manachem\u2019s father, for the first time. That was in \u201945 still. And, then would drive me back either to or at times take me all the way to Lubek where I stayed at the Wollheim home with his first wife, beautiful woman incidentally, and that\u2019s how I reconnected with Julius. This is how I reconnected with Eugenia. They were living in a DP camp in Kiel at the time, and I visited them also in Kiel if Juluis picked me up. I saw Eugenia for the first time since the liberation. And, in the meantime in Hamburg, I did this. I did that."

In Europe, the people don\u2019t even have eyeglasses.\u201d I raised my hand and said, \u201cNot so, my brother wore eyeglasses. There were eyeglasses.

Certainly not in those days before the war, maybe now here and there, but there were no such things as eyeglasses.\u201d And, he had eyeglasses and some of the students had eyeglasses. We have eyeglasses. Then I remember some of the friends that I made over there, I visited their homes in Bensonhurst and in Borough Park, and they said to me, \u201cLook electricity.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And, they were surprised that I was nonplussed by it because they said, \u201cIn Europe, you don\u2019t have this.\u201d I said, \u201cWe had electricity.\u201d So, they were thinking that I was spinning, or running water or things like these, and when they asked me how I lived, and originally when I explained, they thought that I was fibbing. So, I decided to shut up, and just listen and not say anything because what I encountered here were I guess middle class people who had no inkling what another type of lifestyle may be, and my mother did the same. Only among her friends, she had plenty of friends here from pre-war Europe, we knew at our homes, the homes of my relatives, et cetera where the surroundings were sumptuous.

He converted \u2014_ and my aunt, I remember, telling the story before the war, and I saw Pipke in a train going from Berlin to wherever she was going, and suddenly Pipke is there with a big cross, and I said, \u201cPipke, what are you doing with this cross?\u201d And, he said, \u201cWell, this and that.

She wanted to be independent and we did not \u2014 later on we found some moneys back that we had in Europe, but it was a few years later. So, it was tough, but she said for thirty dollars, I can\u2019t make ends meet, et cetera. So, she declined, and I guess he was just as happy that she declined.

The issue was to forewarn the British or not forewarn the British. insisted that 1t was right to forewarn the British even if they would not take the warning seriously. As it happened in the case of the King David Hotel, but so that the innocents will not suffer. The Sternists argued that all Brits are our enemies, look what they\u2019re doing to us, hardly permitting any Jews to migrate to Palestine, and we are not going to forewarn the Brits. And, I was so radicalized over the issue of Jewishness, even though I knew relatively little what it meant, that I joined Stern, and there we seriously trained for all sorts of things including assassination. Interesting, before I quit Stern, that was a chapter 1n itself because I was nearly shot for it \u2014 before I quit Stern, we were going to assassinate Sir Gladywn Jebb. Sir Gladywn Jebb at that time with a British rep at Lake Success at _____. Why were we going to assassinate him, like we assassinated Lloyd Moyne in Egypt in 1944? Assassinated Bernadotte? Because, not because he was not a nice person. He was actually a very nice person, but he represented Britain, Britain\u2019s policies toward the Jews in Palestine.

Josephson wrote the book, \u201cThe Robber Baron\u2019s\u2019\u2019, his brother, I think it was Murray, brother\u2019s name, prominent Wall Street lawyer, and his wife. They let us \u2014 their estate gave us for basic training. We were trained by Sternists hiding here in the United States. The Brits put the price 5,000 pounds in those days, for their heads, and we were trained. We smuggled arms, ammunitions. We learned assassination tactics. We learned all sorts of things on the estate. The FBI and together with Scotland Yard began to discover what we were doing. So, we had to empty out or __s~ what we called storage place of guns, ammunitions, in the Lower Eastside. We dumped it all in the East River. Some of my colleagues were caught. I was not caught dumping some of the stuff in East River. But, an interesting incident happened that affected me very greatly. Our headquarters was on Second Avenue, around Eleventh Street, 149 Second Avenue, and there wasa___ right nearby, a little sort of a synagogue which a where students could study the _, and I went there in order to say kaddish for my father, and I come in and the Rabbi said, I said to the Rabbi, \u201cCan you please help me?

I go now, Yom Kippur, once a year to say kaddish to a synagogue, but otherwise I don\u2019t go. It\u2019s wrong maybe because of one stupid Rabbi having said this, but it affected me emotionally very, very much, this little incident. It wasn\u2019t so much a little incident."

She said, \u201cWhen you\u2019ll be 21, we'll talk about it, but in the meantime you must also get your education.\u201d So, I was combining the two. Anyways, there was a court marshal of me in a basement on Fifty-First Street, Thirteenth Avenue in Borough Park basement, where I was threatened with my life if ever I were to give up the idea of the two sides of the Jordan, traditional Palestine, if ever I were to approach another member of the Stern group that I knew, if ever I were to disclose anything that transpired here in the United States, and our cell structure, so on and so forth. I promised, of course, I wouldn\u2019t do anything of the sort, and they said, \u201cFine, these are our warnings.\u201d And, this came to me as a terrible shock because the movement had become my life, and my closest friends I could no longer see, spend time with, or even talk, and I remember traveling to Brooklyn every morning going to New Utrecht from Manhattan because I loved Brooklyn, and from time to time I would see some on the subway, my buddies, they looked away as if I was a traitor. The way the girl looked away when I had the star, and that affected me enormously because the movement was part of my life. This withdrawal, for six months I had difficulty sleeping I remember, and then it went on. In the meantime, I entered college which I wasn\u2019t very much interested, but the Stern group said that we had to go to City College, why? In those days, City College was excellent, because you had a special professor there, Hans Cohen, the father of the study of nationalism, et cetera, and he was teaching there, and some other courses, but especially nationalism, what it\u2019s all about \u2014 implications, et cetera, et cetera. So, I took the exam and I managed to get in. It was an eight hour entrance exam in those days, very tough, but I managed to get in, and I worked at the same time to help out. I didn\u2019t want \u2014 I knew that my mother was struggling even though she never said a word, et cetera. So, I wanted to make some money on the side. So, I worked in the library. I worked as a runner for a friend of mine, here in the jewelry district who opened a business. So, I managed some way or other always to earn between ten and twenty dollars a week on top of studying et cetera. So, but I did not have to depend on my mother\u2019s meager income. Then, I \u2014 at the beginning, it didn\u2019t interest me very much, the studies, but suddenly, something clicked and I began to read voraciously because my mother kept on saying always, \u201cYou know, a man for me, is not a man without an education.\u201d And would say to me, \u201cHow can one really live a life without reading a good book.\u201d The literature Pushkin, Lermantov, Thomas Mann et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is part of life.\u201d Because they used to discuss it at dinner tables as a child. It didn\u2019t interest me. Characters, who cared? The character\u2019s in a book. Ideas were ridiculous. But, suddenly, something snapped, and I couldn\u2019t stop reading, and I began to read a lot, day and night, and what interested me particularly was a history of World War II, and one thing led to the other, led also to literature, led to philosophy, led to even an interest in the sciences. For a while, I thought of studying medicine. I met a young woman who was going to study medicine. Her father was a doctor. She was interested in medicine. So, I figured I would also take some courses, and I took courses along those lines, but I reacted very poorly to formaldehyde. Pus developed under my eyes and we had to dissect pigs and rats, and from all the formaldehyde, I began to get rashes here on the side. So, I really had trouble, not that medicine interested me, but I decided to have something in common with the woman that I thought I fancied. But, so much the better that I didn\u2019t."
