I had some sort of disorder, whatever it was, I don\u2019t know, but for about six months, we went almost every single day to the Hotel Petersburg in Libau, and that\u2019s how I ate, and also I continued at home to put everything into hot chocolate.

We were products of German culture over there. So, we did not grow up with Yiddish. In Libau, by and large, at that time I did not know of anybody speaking Yiddish. Let\u2019s put it this way. It\u2019s only in the ghetto that I learned about that. And, I remember my father saying, \u201cThat Yiddish\u201d and my mother also, \u201cwas not a language. It was a jargon.\u201d A jargon. We used the French word in German, jargon. And, language 1s something that one has to be in command of. So, the first language was really German that we spoke. When I was small and my parents didn\u2019t want me to understand something, they spoke Russian which, of course, bothered me. So, I picked it up because I heard Russian being spoken all over the place. I went to Latvian school, and Latvian school of course we spoke Latvian. Our main housekeeper, we spoke Latvian. When we had another one, Fenya, she was Russian, and then my father in the building had a nurse, Maria. With her, I spoke German. So, I grew up with all these languages, but my language number one was German. Two, I would say, was probably Latvian at that time. Three, Russian, and English four, because I really liked it, and I made a point of really getting it under my belt."

It was very embarrassing to me, obviously, and this irked me. But, otherwise, I personally did not sense any, what we would call today, anti-Semitism. In those days, I wouldn\u2019t have known the term, obviously. Next to our school was a Jewish School, and sometimes we had matches \u2014 soccer matches \u2014 not soccer matches actually snowball fights.

We\u2019re finally liberated from the dictatorship of \u201d Whatever. I only saw the placards, but not what was on the placards. So, these marches \u2014 yes, I, I was in Riga on that day and I heard his voice, Vishinsky\u2019s voice.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We were not dependent obviously on the 30 Rubles a month. And, he started getting patients for which I don\u2019t think, I mean, he charged. I remember the admiral of the fleet or something along those lines, came and consulted my father and he even came to our house for dinner, the admiral, and I remember this because I admired his uniforms and the illustrious medals that he wore. That was in the new apartment that we had. In the old apartment, we had to take in a Russian soldier. Everyone had to take in Russian soldiers because Libau was a major base for the Russians, and Libau had three ports that never froze in the winters and that\u2019s why you had also a very big naval port in Libau where part of the Russian fleet was stationed. So, it was very strategic significance. Libau as a city, and that is probably why Libau was much bombarded by the Nazis in \u201941 when they invaded, and in \u201944 and \u201945 \u2014 and there was a lot of fighting in and around the city, and the city was about at least 85 percent destroyed in contrast to Riga which was not a strategic site, and there was relatively little fighting, and the city, by and large was preserved, is preserved."

I remember my parents \u2014 the Russians loved music, and they would go to the opera, an in those days when you went to the opera very often you put on a tuxedo and long dress so on and so forth. So, the Russians wanted to show how well they can dress. So, some of the women \u2014 the wives of the officers came in long nightgowns."

A little footnote about this. I was persuaded by \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the name means anything \u2014 Per Ahlmark, Per Ahlmark former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, played a very big role in Jewish life since the \u201870s, \u201880s \u2014 very pro-Israel, very pro-Jewish, convinced Elie to go back tos and accompanied Elie to \u2014_ and wrote about it for the Swedish press.

We had the President\u2019s car and one his \u2014 another one his drivers, and also one of his deputies so we could get into any apartment. I said, \u201cPer, before we go into any of these apartments, from the outside I will tell you exactly the layout so you will not think that I\u2019m imaging or inventing certain things.\u201d Later on he told me, \u201cGeorge, I\u2019ve never seen anybody who has such a memory\u201d, because I was precise on every single issue. For example, before I went into the apartment, I said to him, \u201cWe had central heating.\u201d You see? And, I told him exactly where it is, and I showed it to him which was still preserved. In Riga too where I used to stay with my aunt in a very luxurious, large apartments. At that time in 1990, my aunts, she was the only person. She had an atrium apartment. There were about three or four families living, and I showed him in the room where I used to sleep, et cetera, dining room, living room, sitting room, library, et cetera. He said, \u201cYou know this memory\u2019s absolutely\u201d because, I found \u2014 everything I found to be fascinating, the big world. Now, I heard these talks about when my parents talked when they were in Paris and Berlin and went to the cabarets, this and that. That\u2019s what I wanted to do, and my aunt with whom I stayed, she was married to the Chinese envoy to Germany who died in 1935. Whose father was already ambassador in the days of Bismarck, the Germany, and when she would talk \u2014and so I always thought of foreign policy. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but the lifestyle, I just loved it. I ate it all up, et cetera.

And, we were able to exchange some of it into Rubles, but there were price controls in the Russian period. So, if you made 30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe with three Rubles or four Rubles, but money was not an issue and wasn\u2019t \u2014 and I remember the snickers about the 30 Rubles that he was making, or 35 Rubles perhaps, but it was very low.

Saturday night, my parents went to sleep only at three or four because they played cards at our house. There were about six or seven ladies played Gin Rummy, I mean Kunken, and suddenly early in the morning, there was lots of noise, bombs being dropped et cetera on that Sunday morning, June 22\", of \u2019\u00b041, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a balcony not a terrace, actually only a balcony. And, we all went out to see what happened, and we saw German planes, , flying very low where we could even say hello to the pilots and they sort of winked back at us because it was very low, bombing certain parts. We didn\u2019t know what was happening. We turned on the radio, no news. The news about the outbreak of the war did not come for hours because the Russians were taken by surprise. They didn\u2019t know. Subsequently, I read in the history books that Stalin thought that 1t was not Hitler behind this, the went behind Hitler\u2019s back because Stalin and Molotov were convinced that the Germans were not going to invade, and now suddenly, they did invade. So, the bombings \u2014 this was very exciting. Again, our building was not hit. It was someplace in the center of the city. I did not immediately see any ruins, but as the Germans were moving closer, they occupied Libau one week after the outbreak of the war. My father took us to the hospital which was a little bit outside of the city in a safer neighborhood, and we stayed there for a couple of days until the Germans came in. But, during the bombardment, we also stayed one night in a basement in the center of the city in a kind of a policlinic, a small hospital, and there I saw a lot of the destruction already, and that became to dangerous to stay there in the center of the city because this was  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, we moved to the larger hospital outside the city \u2014 well, it still was in the city district, but in the residential area right near the beach, and I distinctly remember when the Germans arrived, the Latvian doctors asked my father to accompany them to \u201cwelcome the Germans\u201d with roses, et cetera, and my father went and asked about the Jews and the Lieutenant in the car, and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing to worry about. We now have a common foe, and we must fight this common foe and the Jews are part of this war. In the naivety, fighting if you fight together we\u2019re civilized Germans, not racists, et cetera. Like in World War I, if you fight Communism, fine and good, and he was sort of assured, and in a certain naivety, he believed and made us rather believe that we have nothing to worry about, or maybe he just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case."

I remember her doing working in, I guess it must have been a laundry. If I think of it today, for the German Air Force in Libau. She was, and then at a certain point, she became the housekeeper, maid for the mistress, for the Latvian mistress for the head of the in Libau, and my mother knew her from before the war because they used to meet at the same hairdressers called Mary\u2019s.

            "answer": "No, in the meantime, several times we had to move. We moved in to one apartment near my school for a short time. Let me get the sequence straight. Oh, my \u2014 we moved into the servant quarters of the Kessel Villa, K-e-s-s-e-l, because my brother married the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the best of my knowledge. So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the villa was occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. Her husband was Jewish. So, she lived there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel\u2019s \u2014 the husband was already killed, Mrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived behind the building what used to be known as the servant\u2019s quarters. We lived there for a while until we had to move from there and moved to another quarter which was near my school where we were in three rooms \u2014 one, two, three. We were one \u2014 my brother and his newly acquired wife, myself \u2014 we lived, slept in one room. My mother slept in another room, another woman \u2014 Mrs. Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs. Boop\u2019s apartment. Yes, she was killed during the war, and two young women slept in another room. So we were about six or seven people in this small apartment of about four or five rooms, excluding the kitchen. And, from there, well an announcement came that we will be moved to a ghetto \u2014 we\u2019ll have to move to a ghetto which is in a part of Libau, a section of Libau that I did not know very well, and there in the ghetto this was in the summer of \u201943, we were assigned to a flat in a basement that had a kind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few steps \u2014 we had to go about five or six steps, right off the entrance, rear entrance of the building, and there including the kitchen there were one, two, three rooms. So, two rooms and where people could sleep. In these two rooms, my brother and his wife, and my mother and I slept, in this basement apartment, and in the other room there were about four people who slept, and we shared the same toilet. We shared the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we made the best of this situation. I was working for a while in the ghetto in the garden, vegetable garden, and then I was \u201casked, invited\u201d to become the commandant\u2019s runner in the Libau ghetto. The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher. He closed his eyes to many things especially when people brought 1n some extra food to the ghetto. He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the war who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

This in order to try to release Jews from the prison to bribe the Germans, et cetera. So, this was \u2014 I remember people coming around for specific arrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and this and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of prison and so on and so forth. But, this brings me back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto. Immediately after the revolution in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up the palaces. You could buy everything and anything for very little money. And, we had antique \u2014 an antique for example living room that came from one of the Czarist palaces. We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia, and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia. So, in addition to the Persian carpets and the Grand piano, et cetera, this was very exclusive furniture that we had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers. I remember two in particular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the ghetto. And, not only the German , but also the German Navy. There was a certain Inspector Ulmann of the German Navy. Incidentally, the old \u2014 where we lived before World War I, the building that became the headquarters of the Communist Party during World War II became the headquarters of the German Navy for the region, and this Inspector Ulmann came very often to our apartment, and with a crew would take a lot of the things from the apartment, and then of course, we also had people from the \u2014__s coming with their crews to take, and there was one guy fromthe by the name of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was a collector of stamps, and my late brother had a huge stamp collection and he traded stamps with all over the world. There was actually an exhibition here in Philadelphia in memoriam for my brother, a big stamp collection, where it is all described and I have a photograph with my late mother, still. She was already sick and we went to Philadelphia. This must have be in 1963, when there was this big exhibition in Philadelphia. And, he took, and I\u2019m sure he took it for himself because he was an art collector, and then we had to two Leica cameras, one German and one Russian Leica, I remember, and we gave one of them to one of the Latvians who came to the house to look for things. I think, and I would have to establish this, I\u2019m not sure, but one of the Latvians was a notorious murderer by the name of Cukurs. He had several fingers missing. I don\u2019t know how come, but I remember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name Cukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the famous Arias, commander of Latvians who killed Jews with a vengeance. And, this man with the fingers came and looked for things, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the Leicas because we had two still hidden in the apartment. This is when we were still living in the apartment to which we moved during the Russian period."

We could only go right off the sidewalk, and I remember it was in the winter, going and a fellow student, a girl, came in my direction. We were in the same class, and we walked and I wanted to say hello to her, and it happened to be a girl I fancied as a child. Veltina was her name. She sort of looked away, and I felt embarrassed that I was a Jew, that I had to wear this and I could not go on the sidewalk. It was something strange. Why should I feel embarrassed? But, I remember feeling embarrassed that I am who I am. It\u2019s a very strange sensation that I had, just as strange as the same winter when I thought maybe a German victory would be helpful to us.

Look how well I\u2019m doing in my practice.\u201d So, independently of his parents, but my grandfather was a big merchant in the grains \u2014 import and export \u2014 and, we had at least one warehouse that I was aware of with elevators in front of it, railroad tracks, right at the pier, because he exported a lot to England and elsewhere, but one of my relatives told me that we had another warehouse on the other side of the pier exactly facing it. This I don\u2019t know. Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one because it was not sold until the late \u201830s, the other one. So, maybe the first one they didn\u2019t bother talking about. But, I did not know until I heard about it over here that there was a second one. Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over here is that when the governor of St. Petersburg came to Libau, he would always come to Libau and play bridge with my grandfather, and they were very good friends, but I would think that the big money came from my grandfather.

We came in 800 some odd people, and we were taken to the concentration camp, roughly the same number. So, there were few killings between the period between the time we got into the ghetto and went to Riga Kaiserwald to the concentration camp, but it was still the fear everyday."

We could get that, and we still had a diamond here, a dollar there, so on and so forth. We could still do business, so to speak. We could still bring in. So, I do not really remember starving. That we had our pre-World War food obviously is not the case or even the food that we had during the Russian period, but we had enough bread. We had some butter. We had sometimes a piece of salami. We had even sometimes I got hot chocolate. So, I don\u2019t remember starving in the ghetto, let\u2019s put it this way."

The the commotion in Riga, it was a big city for me in contrast to Libau which was sort of a sleepy, smaller city of some 70,000 inhabitants. Riga at that time had close to half a million people. It was the city of my dreams as a child. So, I imagined Riga when I was being transported, I was thinking of the Riga beaches, the summers we spent there. I was thinking of my aunt\u2019s apartment, the parties. I was thinking of the cafes, of the Riga Zoo, wonderful, wonderful memories. And, then we were told we were coming to Kaiserwald. Kaiserwald was the most exclusive suburb in Riga at this time. Kaiserwald means the Forest of the Kaiser. And, one of my aunts and my granddad had a beautiful villa there, Kaiserwald, gorgeous.

It was still dark, probably very early in the morning next day. Suddenly, the doors were slid open. SS men beginning to scream and also some of the non-Jewish prisoners in very strange garb, namely in concentration camp garb screaming, \u201cOut, out with you dirty Jews, out!\u201d And, beating us, beating us like crazy, and then we had to run from \u2014 which wasn\u2019t very far, maybe fifty or sixty yards \u2014 to the camp from the railroad track. And, there we were told to throw all the luggage and to take off the coat, and throw it on a pile, and my mother didn\u2019t want to do it, and I remember saying to my mother, \u201cBut, mother we\u2019re told that we\u2019re going to get it back.

My brother after a few days was taken to a kaisernierung, to a camp outside the camp where he worked in their reichsbarn which had happened to be a very good kaisernierung. The people were treated relatively well. My mother was assigned to a job in the concentration camp, in the tanklager, and sometimes she managed to convince, I don\u2019t know how that I go with her to the tanklager, not to remain in camp because if you remain in camp you never know what can happen.

I said, \u201cBut, did you eat?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I am full.\u201d She would say, but she was not, but she threw me her portion because in the mornings we would receive moldy bread, some sugar, some kind of a marmalade, and this was very bad because \u2014 this was bad because we all got diarrhea from it, and a kind of a coffee that didn\u2019t taste like coffee at least to me as a child. It was terrible, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me. So, I asked my mother, and she very often was able to throw me her portion, and I ate, and I remember at that time, there was a Mr. Kaufman who was a friend from before the war. And, I went to him and I said to him in German, \u201cMr. Kaufman, do you happen to have a slice of bread? I\u2019m very, very hungry.\u201d He said to me, \u201cGeorge, I wish I had I could give you, but I don\u2019t.\u201d And, Pll never forget this. He died in New York. He was the first chairman of the Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he always remembered this, and I remember this particular incident as well. But, it was done still. It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr. Kaufman that I addressed him. It was not Max or sort of the way we\u2019re accustomed to here. Yes, and then, interestingly enough in this Tanklager, which was a tough place, there was a German guard by the name of Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat the Jews like anything. He came I think from Romania or some place from that area, but he liked my mother, and would always address her as Frau Dr. Schwab, and when he was patrolling, he would say, \u201cYou can go into this shack\u201d where there was a stove and what we confiscated. We used to call it organizier, we organized something. We stole something \u2014 potatoes so we could slice and put it against the oven and roast potatoes. That became a delicacy. So, and he permitted me to go with my mother. So, we could go in. We could warm-up, et cetera. We would have our potato so on and so forth. One day, we were marching toward the Tanklager again in the winter, and my mother told me she had a terrible case of diarrhea and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. in German. She went over to him and said, \u201cI really have to step out.\u201d He said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d He slowed down the column, permitted my mother to attend to what she had, and then she rejoined the column. Why did he do it? I don\u2019t know. My mother was gold blonde, very fair skinned, bluish-grey eyes, looked like a thousand Aryans. Actually, she was told and that was still going back now in Libau, if she wanted to be saved to be taken to Germany, she could be saved. She said, \u201cI\u2019Il be delighted if I can bring my sons with me.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, you can not.\u201d Then, she said, \u201cThen I stay with my sons.\u201d And, that was still in Libau, because they distinguished sometimes the genotype from the phenotype, genetically Jewish versus the appearance, and if your appearance was \u201cAryan\u201d especially Nordic, which my mother was, then you could manipulate, but she was actually asked.

It was something in because certain of the things we managed to give to a Latvian patient of my father\u2019s who was a head of a bank by the name of Abelit. His name was Abelit, and he did come through, this Abelit, and sent the things to Kohler and Kohler instructed my brother to get a message to me that I should be in the camp on those three days and he will send a car for me. And, indeed, but not for my mother, but for me. And, my mother said, \u201cAbsolutely you go. It\u2019s and don\u2019t worry about me. I'll be all right.\u201d So, I went and joined my brother, but I was not the only one in the car. There was apparently a few more who had similar deals because he could be bribed. He was one who could be bribed. And, then my mother, we learned later, also went to an out camp to work camp called the SS , the SS vegetable garden for the SS et cetera. So, that\u2019s where she was, and then I saw my mother very briefly. We had word that she would passing the reichsbahn.

Now, we were full of lice in Stutthof. The facilities were terrible. Sanitary facilities in Kaiserwald were also bad. For example, the toilet was a kind of an outhouse. It was a square pit, and was \u2014 on top of this what was constructed were columns. Columns was a wooden \u201cbench\u201d maybe six or eight inches and you would have to lift yourself up, that I never fell into the pit was a miracle, and incidentally, there were some kapos that were so bad that they were thrown into the pit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples.

So, you could augment the poor food that we got with some of the extras, but a few months later, some people did the same thing, organize some food, and they were caught by the Germans. And, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a lesson that theft 1s punishable. And, what they did was hang the people, and we were forced to march to see the hanging, and then march around the hangers to see them. How did I survive this one? When it was announced hanging people, I didn\u2019t understand what it means, how a person can hang. Again, it became interesting to me to look at the person hanging. I didn\u2019t understand that this is involved with death. I did not put two and two together. How can a person hang? And, only while hanging did I realize that the person was hanged and it meant actual death. I did not connect this before. So, to me again, it was a kind of a spectacle. Theater of the Absurd, if you want to call it, or something along those lines. Sick! But I remember the context very well because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted?

And, this happened three, four months before our liberation when the Russians were already on German soil, and also during this period in Stolp, the German Jewish couples began to behave atrociously to the Eastern European Jews. When somebody was caught organizing something internally or so, he had to receive twenty lashes, and the German Jewish couples were only delighted to mete out the punishment. One of them was Kentcourik who was particularly brutal. For some reason or other, both of these couples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me, maybe because I spoke their type of German, and left me pretty much alone this and that and were actually nice, but they were absolute \u2014 excuse me for using the term here \u2014 bastards. And, I\u2019m jumping now forward for a minute. I was in the same hospital, after, right after the war as Kentcourik, and I came out of the hospital and was brought back by the British to the rehabilitation, to the rehabilitation barrack in the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein with one of the British Red Cross cars, ambulance cars, and Kentcourik \u2014 I informed the other guys who were there, fellows, many of them that I was liberated with that Kentcourik was coming out. \u201cOh, Kentcourik is coming out. We\u2019ll beat the hell out of him,\u201d and Kentcourik came in thinking that\u2019s he\u2019s coming 1n as a great hero, and chairs flew into his face, this and that, so on and so forth. He was taken back to the hospital seriously injured. He survived this, and after the war he had two daughters, moved with his two daughters to Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don\u2019t remember what happened to his other one, Grunwald, but that was the fate of this German Jewish couple Kentcourik."

I found this out only after I met her, we spent about a week in these cattle cars with hardly any food, no facilities to speak of, 1n the corners we had where the stench was absolutely incredible. Finally, we came to Danzig and we didn\u2019t manage to get to Stutthof and we were brought to another small camp Burggraben, and we marched. It was a long march from Danzig to Burggraben. It was very cold, I remember. It was about easily, easily ten, twelve miles in our circumstance to march. We arrived in Burggrabben. It was knee deep in mud. There were no German guards. It was no man\u2019s land between the Russian front and the German front. The Russians would shoot their artillery across our heads, and the Germans would shoot their artillery across our heads."

And, again, we were hauled off in these mini-train, these mini-railroad tracks, not the regular ones to barges in Danzig, or near Danzig, barges. And, then we were taken on these barges on the high seas \u2014 the Baltic, the North Sea. For the trip, we received a loaf of bread and some water. That was it because we subsisted on sea water during the trip, salt water. SS Guards were guarding us, and if you had to step out, you had to do it over the railing and into the water on these barges, and you could see the SS Guards pushing people with their shoes into the Baltic or into the North Sea. I remember very distinctly I suddenly saw a German coming, passing me. I thought, well, this was my end, but it passed me and didn\u2019t do anything. And, we were down, et cetera. To climb up we had no strength left or anything of the sort, but Julius despite his illness, I mean he was as strong as a bull. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my life. And, suddenly we were told that we had arrived in Hamburg, but I don\u2019t think it was Hamburg, but this 1s what I remember, and that we had to get out very quickly for Hamburg because the Americans were in Hamburg.

He said, \u201cNope, you\u2019re coming with me\u2019, and took me by the collar and dragged me.

And, now another march. We were going to march someplace, and I said to Julius, again, \u201cJulius, please leave me alone! I want to die.\u201d And, he was all swollen from the dog where he was bitten. He said, \u201cNo\u201d, and again he pushed me. And, the march was not a long one, a couple of miles, and we arrived at this huge complex, a German U-boat school. There was a huge soccer field, and there were thousands and thousands of people there from other camps.

I was semi-delirious and I was really starved, and in the shuffle in these thousands of people, I lost Julius. I wandered around. British planes were overhead and shooting, and the Cap Arcona was offshore, but there was another ship, the Athens, and we were supposed to line up and get onto the Athens to be taken to the Cap Arcorna. And, I wandered around still, and suddenly, I see a pile of things, and I was in a delirious state by then, a German guard looking at it, guns \u2014 all sorts of things, and saw there what I would call today \u2014 it was soap, but I mistook it for bread. I picked it up and I started to eat it, and I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t bite it. I couldn\u2019t eat it. It didn\u2019t taste like bread. So, I threw it away, and I walked over to the guard and said to him, \u201cMay I have a slice of bread?\u201d He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you walk over to this tank? This is a British tank. You have been liberated, walk over and you'll get something.\u201d So, I walked over to the tank. The British, I decided to speak English, I said, \u201cI\u2019m very, very hungry.

            "answer": "No, I had a feeling that she\u2019s alive, but where, what, when, et cetera, no. Before I go to the Warburg Estate, a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying to convince me to go back to Latvia, go back to Latvia, go back to the Soviet Union, et cetera. The answer \u2014 my answer was a categorical no because we made a pact, a family, never go east, go back. You go. We have relatives in England, the United States, and we\u2019re given a name so on and so forth to remember, but never go back, and I said, \u201cCategorically, I\u2019m not going back.\u201d The British officers still tried to convince me to go back, and a good number did go back. Some of them are now in Israel. After horror \u2014 after spending horrible times in the Soviet Union in Latvia until the \u201870s, and I refused to go back. Then, the Brits became suspicious of me that I wasn\u2019t Jewish, despite the fact that I\u2019m circumcised, and put me, brought me, took me to a Latvian children\u2019s home where only Latvian was spoken, where some of the leaders were former patients of my father, where they talked about Tievzeme in Latvian, the Fatherland, how eventually we\u2019ll all go back to the Fatherland, et cetera, but this was a little bit strange to me because we had Latvian guards. Some of the Latvians were innocuous. Others were horrible. I believe this guy Cukurs, especially Cukurs. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable there. They also wanted to introduce me \u2014 they had with a woman. This was in . She wanted to introduce me to General Dankers who apparently knew my father. General Dankers was one of the sympathizers, Nazi sympathizers who managed to get to Lubek. He headed Latvian troops, so on and so forth. But, which I did not know exactly, but General Dankers just didn\u2019t sound right that I should meet him. In Lubek, she wanted to take me because apparently he knew  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

One day, when the head, this woman, went to Lubek for a day or so, I decided to run away, and I ran away and I ran all the way to the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein. the DP Camp.\u201d But, this was a second time around, not the first time. The first time I was brought back to the \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. This was the second time around because the first time after a few days I had a relapse, and I was taken back to the hospital for another twelve days. The second time, it was when they took me to the Latvian children\u2019s home, and after a few weeks, I ran away. I came to the camp which was in this U-boat school, and I went to the bunk where I had originally brought back, the rehabilitation bunk, and I\u2019ve got a bed so on and so forth, and what were the people doing? Playing poker. Playing poker. Playing \u2014 what you call it? They call 1t 21? \u2014 Blackjack, blackjack, and making piles of money. In those days, the exchange rate was one dollar to 600 Marks, and I don\u2019t know how I got a few Marks to play also. I figured, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And, I had a very good memory, and after a few days, I saw this and I knew every card that had gone out and so on and so forth. I began to play, and I piled in tens of thousands of Marks which translates into dollars, maybe it was twenty or twenty-five dollars, but in Marks, it sounded enormous amount, and then I decided that it\u2019s time for me to see the world."

            "answer": "That was not a problem. I bought my ticket. I went to Hamburg, and I remembered going to a police station saying, \u201cI looked for so and so.\u201d I spoke German, and I didn\u2019t know. So, I was taken to the Warburg Estate in , a Suburb of Hamburg which the Warburg family had temporarily given over to \u2014 I guess there\u2019s a joint distribution committee of the American Relief Unit to turn it into a children\u2019s home, just a small children\u2019s home. I arrived there, and I was told, \u201cYes, I belong there.\u201d So, that\u2019s how I arrived. It must have been late summer or early fall. I remember a few weeks later, getting an attack, appendix attack. I was operated on. I was all alone. I was scared, in the Altona Hospital in Hamburg. I spoke German. I told them that my father was a gastroenterologist. I spoke German to them. They were very nice to me, but I was still very much afraid. They were Germans. You don\u2019t know what they can do to me. I thought at that time, and I always reacted very poorly to ether, and I remember throwing off the mask in those days, but before the war my tonsils were removed also under ether and I reacted very poorly in Riga, and I threw off the mask, which I did again, but next thing I knew I came out of the operation all right. I stayed for a number of days in the hospital. When I was brought back for further recovery to the estate. Now came the issue \u2014 there were several issues. First of all, to find mother, and then I wanted to go to Palestine because there were people from the Jewish Brigade in uniform and out of uniform, legally and illegally, Hamburg to train us. Not only to teach us Hebrew, the history of Israel, the history of Palestine, Jewish History, also Hebrew, mathematics, so on and so forth, but prepare also for Aliyjah Bet which was illegal immigration. And, the war to an extent, it\u2019s only in retrospect that radicalized me. Why did I suffer? I suffered because I\u2019m a Jew. Is there anything really to be ashamed of being a Jew? No, I was ashamed when I met the girl that I fancied on the street, and, you know, shame came over me that I could not really talk and I really felt inferior which I never did before. But, this was a kind of a reaction I guess to my timidity at the time to having felt ashamed that I reacted the way I did, and was prepared to go to Palestine, prepared to take up a gun against the British because they were so horrible also to the Jews not permitting the Jews to come in, giving maybe 1,500 certificates a month, and there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands and Jews who wanted to move to Palestine, so on and so forth, but this comes a little later. When it\u2019s all started, and my mother and brother, especially my mother said, \u201cYou go west, never go east.\u201d You must remember your relatives in America, and in England. In London, remember your Uncle Robert, Robert Schwab. I said, \u201cYes, of course. He visited us in Libau. I remember him well.\u2019\u201d\u2019 Remember to write simply Robert Schwab, Director Shell Oil, London, England it will arrive because he was one of the heads of Shell Oil, but I had forgotten that he was the director of Shell Oil. So, I wrote, \u201cRobert Schwab, London, England.\u201d It all went through military mail because you could not write. It went through the Joint Distribution Committee. It never arrived. To my cousin in Salt Lake City, I wrote, \u201cMr. David Alder.\u201d He was married to my cousin Anna Alder, who\u2019s in this photograph who went to America, and there I wrote to Mr. David Alder, Director Shell Oil, but he was not Director of Shell Oil, and it arrived to the local manager of Shell Oil in Salt Lake City, letter after letter. He disregarded it, but one day he decided to look up in the phone book in Salt Lake City who this David Alder was. It turned out that he was the owner of an insurance company in Salt Lake City, David  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, he called David Alder and asked him, \u201cDoes the name George Schwab mean anything to you?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, he is my wife\u2019s cousin.\u201d So, this was a first contact. I wrote to my other cousin in West Hartford, Broskin, it never arrived because it was just Dr. and Mrs. Broskin, Hartford, Connecticut. It never arrived. But, this man, this one man, immediately contacted my uncle in London and contacted his sister, his wife\u2019s sister in Hartford, Connecticut. So, they were already now in touch, but my mother knew to write the correct. So, she independently got in touch, and this way we connected. We were able to speak on the phone, on the military phone once a week."

            "answer": "She was liberated in Lauenburg, it is on the map over there, already in March, and she worked as a nurse in the Russian hospital. Then, she heard later on in May or June that there are a lot of Jews in Lodz, and maybe I am one of those who she could find in Lodz or get some information. Turns out that she arrives in Lodz, gets off a trolley car and somebody says, \u201cFrau Dr. Schwab in German. Frau Dr. Schwab. Frau Dr. Schwab.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, who was it?\u201d It\u2019s is Mrs. Dorbian the son comes now several times had come to Latvia. He\u2019s my age. We were together in . It was his mother. \u201cDo you know that George is alive in the British zone?\u201d She didn\u2019t ask, \u201cWhere? When?\u201d She was so overwhelmed, she ran back to Lauenburg, picked up her few things that she had, and went to Berlin almost penniless, comes to Berlin and Berlin was a second home to her because she had been very often to Berlin before the war especially in the \u201820s and early \u201830s. And, decided she was going to go to the Joint Distribution Committee. She went to the Joint Distribution Committee. They wanted to test her, \u201cWho is she?\u201d She didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. She looked like a thousand percent Aryan. So, they were suspicious because many wanted to do things, and she got away with no results, but she went back to the Joint several times, and then there was a woman who said to her, \u201cYou know Mrs. Schwab, I believe your story. I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d And, with the help of this person, she was able to write to the United States because again, everything had to go through military mail, and through them she found out where I am which the Joint was able to connect me then by telephone to my mother because the Warburgs, the Joint Distribution Committee and the American and the English Relief Unit were sort of the heads of the so-called children\u2019s home in the Warburg estate, were able to connect once a week. My mother went to the Joint in Berlin, and I was, of course at the Warburg Estate, and it was pre- arranged what time we would be talking. So, we started to talk, and in those days, it was not easy to go from Hamburg from the British zone to Berlin because you had to go to the British Sector or the American sector because we had to go by way of the Soviet zone, and it took months before I was brought to Berlin. But, in the meantime, when my relatives found out that I was alive, they started bombarding me with packages and money, and every single letter was five dollars, ten dollars, twenty dollars. Sometimes I received a package a day. I didn\u2019t know what to do with cigarettes and coffee, but they wrote me they coffee and the cigarettes are not for you, but we\u2019ve been led to understand that there\u2019s a lot you can do with it in Germany.

In Europe, the people don\u2019t even have eyeglasses.\u201d I raised my hand and said, \u201cNot so, my brother wore eyeglasses. There were eyeglasses. I saw many people with eyeglasses.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re dreaming. Certainly not in those days before the war, maybe now here and there, but there were no such things as eyeglasses.\u201d And, he had eyeglasses and some of the students had eyeglasses. We have eyeglasses. Then I remember some of the friends that I made over there, I visited their homes in Bensonhurst and in Borough Park, and they said to me, \u201cLook electricity.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d And, they were surprised that I was nonplussed by it because they said, \u201cIn Europe, you don\u2019t have this.\u201d I said, \u201cWe had electricity.\u201d So, they were thinking that I was spinning, or running water or things like these, and when they asked me how I lived, and originally when I explained, they thought that I was fibbing. So, I decided to shut up, and just listen and not say anything because what I encountered here were I guess middle class people who had no inkling what another type of lifestyle may be, and my mother did the same. Only among her friends, she had plenty of friends here from pre-war Europe, we knew at our homes, the homes of my relatives, et cetera where the surroundings were sumptuous. So, in this milieu, I kept my mouth shut because they just didn\u2019t believe me."

She said, \u201cWhen you\u2019ll be 21, we'll talk about it, but in the meantime you must also get your education.\u201d So, I was combining the two. Anyways, there was a court marshal of me in a basement on Fifty-First Street, Thirteenth Avenue in Borough Park basement, where I was threatened with my life if ever I were to give up the idea of the two sides of the Jordan, traditional Palestine, if ever I were to approach another member of the Stern group that I knew, if ever I were to disclose anything that transpired here in the United States, and our cell structure, so on and so forth. I promised, of course, I wouldn\u2019t do anything of the sort, and they said, \u201cFine, these are our warnings.\u201d And, this came to me as a terrible shock because the movement had become my life, and my closest friends I could no longer see, spend time with, or even talk, and I remember traveling to Brooklyn every morning going to New Utrecht from Manhattan because I loved Brooklyn, and from time to time I would see some on the subway, my buddies, they looked away as if I was a traitor.

In the meantime, I entered college which I wasn\u2019t very much interested, but the Stern group said that we had to go to City College, why?

Then, I \u2014 at the beginning, it didn\u2019t interest me very much, the studies, but suddenly, something clicked and I began to read voraciously because my mother kept on saying always, \u201cYou know, a man for me, is not a man without an education.\u201d And would say to me, \u201cHow can one really live a life without reading a good book.\u201d The literature Pushkin, Lermantov, Thomas Mann et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is part of life.\u201d Because they used to discuss it at dinner tables as a child. It didn\u2019t interest me. Characters, who cared? The character\u2019s in a book. Ideas were ridiculous. But, suddenly, something snapped, and I couldn\u2019t stop reading, and I began to read a lot, day and night, and what interested me particularly was a history of World War II, and one thing led to the other, led also to literature, led to philosophy, led to even an interest in the sciences. For a while, I thought of studying medicine. I met a young woman who was going to study medicine. Her father was a doctor. She was interested in medicine. So, I figured I would also take some courses, and I took courses along those lines, but I reacted very poorly to formaldehyde. Pus developed under my eyes and we had to dissect pigs and rats, and from all the formaldehyde, I began to get rashes here on the side.
