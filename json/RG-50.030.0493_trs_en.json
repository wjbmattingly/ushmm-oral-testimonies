We used the French word in German, jargon. And, language is something that one has to be in command of. So, the first language was really German that we spoke. When I was small and my parents didn\u2122t want me to understand something, they spoke Russi an which, of course, bothered me. So, I picked it up because I heard Russian being spoken all over the place. I went to Latvian school, and Latvian school of course we spoke Latvian. Our main housekeeper, we spoke Latvian. When we had another one, Fenya, she was Russian, and then my father in the building had a nur se, Maria. With her, I spoke German. So, I grew up with all these languages, but my language number one was German. Two, I would say, was probably Latvian at that time.

That was in the new apartment that we had. In the old apartment, we had to take in a Russian soldier. Everyone had to take in Russian soldiers because Libau was a majo r base for the Russians, and Libau had three ports that never froze in the winters and that\u2122s why you had also a very big naval port in Libau where part of the Russian fleet was stationed. So, it was very strategic significance. Libau as a city, and that is probably why Libau was much bombarded by the Nazis in \u212241 when they i nvaded, and in \u212244 and \u212245 \u0152 and there was a lot of fighting in and around the city, and the city was about at least 85 percent destroyed in contrast to Riga which was not a strategic site, and there was relatively little fighting, and the city, by and large was preserved, is preserved."

He came, bu t sometimes drunk, had very curious habits, not washing himself, but spraying himself with a kind of an autocologne that smelled terribly, but this was common apparently among the Russian soldiers. Different culture- different habits, et cetera, and people used to laugh. I remember my parents \u0152 the Russians loved music, and they would go to the opera, an in those days when you went to the opera very often you put on a tuxedo and long dress so on and so forth. So, the Russians wanted to show how well they can dress. So, some of the women \u0152 the wives of the officers came in long nightgowns."

A little footnote about this. I was persuaded by \u0152 I don\u2122t know if the name means anything \u0152 Per Ahlmark, Per Ahlmark former Deputy Prime Mi nister of Sweden, played a very big role in Jewish life since the \u201a70s, \u201a80s \u0152 very pro-Israel, very pro-Jewish, convinced Elie to go back to ____ and accompanied Elie to ____ and wrote about it for the Swedish press. It was he who persuaded me to go back and accompanied me too, and wrote a series of articles in the Swedish press about my return to Libau. Before we went into any of my apartments where I li ved in Riga and Libau in 1990. We had the President\u2122s car and one his \u0152 another one his drivers, and also one of his deputies so we could get into any apartment. I sai d, \ufb01Per, before we go into any of these apartments, from the outside I will tell you exactly the layout so you will not think that I\u2122m imaging or inventing certain thi ngs.\ufb02 Later on he told me, \ufb01George, I\u2122ve never seen anybody who has such a memory\ufb02, because I was precise on every single issue. For example, before I went into the apartment, I said to him, \ufb01We had central heating.\ufb02 You see? And, I told him exactly where it is, and I showed it to him which was still preserved. In Riga too where I used to stay with my aunt in a very luxurious, large apartments. At that time in 1990, my aunts, she was the only person. She had an atrium apartment. There were about three or four families living, and I showed him in the room where I used to sleep, et cetera, dining room, living room, sitting room, library, et cetera. He said, \ufb01You know this memory\u2122s absolutely\ufb02 because, I found \u0152 everything I found to be fascinating, the big world. Now, I heard these talks about when my parents talked when they were in Paris and Berlin and went to the cabarets, this and that. That\u2122s what I wanted to do, and my aunt with whom I stayed, she was married to the Chinese envoy to Germany who died in 1935. Whose father was already ambassador in the days of Bismar ck, the Germany, and when she would talk \u0152 and so I always thought of foreign policy. I didn\u2122t know what it was, but the lifestyle, I just loved it. I ate it all up, et cetera. The diplomatic life, what my mother would tell me about when they were in Berlin in the \u201a20s, what was going on so on and so forth. For example, my mother love d to go in the subways. She said, \ufb01I came 28 here in order to see Berlin.\ufb02 My father had lived in Berlin because he had studied there. \ufb01I want to see Berlin. I go by bus.\ufb02 My aunt said, \ufb01But you have my car with a driver. What\u2122s the matter with you, Clara?\ufb02 My mother said, \ufb01No, I am going to go in the subway. I am going to go in the elevat or. I\u2122m going to go in the buses.

So, if you made 30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe with three Rubles or four Rubles, but money was not an issue and wasn\u2122t \u0152 and I remember the snickers about the 30 Rubles that he was making, or 35 Rubles perh aps, but it was very low. It was in the 30s I remember, but it didn\u2122t matter to us personally."

Saturday night, my parents went to sleep only at three or four because they played cards at our house. There were about six or seven ladies played Gin Rummy, I mean Kunken, and suddenly early in the morning, there was lots of noise, bombs being dropped et cetera on that Sunday morning, June 22 nd, of \u212241, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a balcony not a terrace, actually only a balc ony. And, we all went out to see what happened, and we saw German planes, ______ , flying very low where we could even say hello to the pilots and they sort of winked back at us because it was very low, bombing certain parts. We didn\u2122t know wh at was happening. We turned on the radio, no news. The news about the outbreak of the war did not come for hours because the Russians were taken by surprise. They didn\u2122t know. Subsequently, I read in the history books that Stalin thought that it was not Hitler behind this, the ____ went behind Hitler\u2122s back because Stalin and Molotov were convinced that the Germans were not going to invade, and now suddenly, they did invade. So, the bombings \u0152 this was very exciting. Again, our building was not hit. It was someplace in the center of the city. I did not immediatel y see any ruins, but as the Germans were moving closer, they occupied Libau one week after the outbreak of the war. My father took us to the hospital which was a little bit outside of the city in a safer neighborhood, and we stayed there for a couple of days until the Germans came in. But, during the bombardment, we also stayed one night in a basement in the center of the city in a kind of a policlinic, a small hospital, and there I saw a lot of the destruction already, and that became to dangerous to stay there in the center of the city because this was 34 being bombarded by the German Navy and s ubsequently by the Army. So, we moved to the larger hospital outside the city \u0152 well, it still was in the city district, but in the residential area right near the beach, and I distinctly remember when the Germans arrived, the Latvian doctors asked my fath er to accompany them to \ufb01welcome the Germans\ufb02 with roses, et ceter a, and my father went and asked about the Jews and the Lieutenant in the car, and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing to worry about. We now have a common foe, and we must fight this common foe and the Jews are part of this war. In the naivety, fighting if you fight together we\u2122re civilized Germans, not racists, et ceter a. Like in World War I, if you fight Communism, fine and good, and he was sort of assured, and in a certain naivety, he believed and made us rather believe that we have nothing to worry about, or maybe he just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case."

            "question": "So, your mother has a couple of jobs, and are you still living in that smaller apartment?",
            "answer": "No, in the meantime, several times we had to move. We moved in to one apartment near my school for a short time. Let me get the sequence straight. Oh, my \u0152 we moved into the servant quarte rs of the Kessel Villa, K-e-s-s-e-l, because my brother married the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the best of my knowledge. So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the villa was occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. Her husband was Jewish. So, she lived there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel\u2122s \u0152 the husband was already killed, Mrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived behind the building what used to be known as the servant\u2122s quarters. We lived there for a while until we had to move from there and moved to another quarter which was near my school where we were in three rooms \u0152 one, two, three. We were one \u0152 my brother and his newly acquired wife, myself \u0152 we lived, slept in one room. My mother slept in another room, another woman \u0152 Mrs. Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs. Boop\u2122s apartment. Yes, she was killed dur ing the war, and two young women slept in another room. So we were about six or seven people in this small apartment of about four or five rooms, excluding the kitc hen. And, from there, well an announcement came that we will be moved to a ghetto \u0152 we\u2122ll have to move to a ghetto which is in a part of Libau, a section of Libau that I did not know very well, and there in the ghetto this was in the summer of \u212243, we were as signed to a flat in a basement that had a kind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few steps \u0152 we had to go about five or six steps, right off the entrance, rear entrance of th e building, and there including the kitchen there were one, two, three rooms. So, tw o rooms and where people could sleep. In these two rooms, my brother and his wife , and my mother and I slept, in this basement apartment, and in the other room there were about four people who slept, and we shared the same toilet. We shared the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we made the best of this situation. I was work ing for a while in the ghetto in the garden, vegetable garden, and then I was \ufb01asked, invited\ufb02 to become the commandant\u2122s runner in the Libau ghetto. The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher. He closed his eyes to many things especia lly when people brought in some extra food to the ghetto. He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the war who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to 42 him, and this reminds me even before we moved into the ghetto, there were collections of gold coins. This in order to try to release Jews from the prison to bribe the Germans, et cetera. So, this was \u0152 I remember people coming around for specific arrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and this and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of prison and so on and so forth. But, this brings me back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto. Immediately after the revolu tion in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up the palaces. You could buy everything and anything for very little money. And, we had antique \u0152 an antique for example living room that came from one of the Czarist palaces. We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia, and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia. So, in addition to the Persian carpets and the Grand piano, et cetera, this was very exclusive furniture that we had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers. I remember two in particular, and all this was taken by the Germ ans before we came even to the ghetto. And, not only the German _____, but also the German Navy. There was a certain Inspector Ulmann of the German Navy. Incide ntally, the old \u0152 where we lived before World War II, the building th at became the headquarters of the Communist Party during World War II became the headquarters of the German Navy for the region, and this Inspector Ulmann came very often to our apartment, and with a crew would take a lot of the things from the apartment, and then of course, we also had people from the ____ coming with their crews to take, and there was one guy from the ____ by the name of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was a collector of stamps, and my late brother had a huge stamp collection and he traded stamps with all over the world. There was actually an exhibition here in Philadelphia in memoriam for my brother, a big stamp collection, where it is all described and I have a photograph with my late mother, still. She was already sick and we went to Philadelphia. This must have be in 1963, when there was this big exhibition in Philadelphia. And, he took, and I\u2122m sure he took it for himself because he was an art collector, a nd then we had to two Leica cameras, one German and one Russian Leica, I remember, and we gave one of them to one of the Latvians who came to the house to look fo r things. I think, and I would have to establish this, I\u2122m not sure, but one of th e Latvians was a notorious murderer by the name of Cukurs. He had several fing ers missing. I don\u2122t know how come, but I remember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name Cukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the fam ous Arias, commander of Latvians who killed Jews with a vengeance. And, this man with the fingers came and looked for things, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the Leicas because we had two still hidden in the apartm ent. This is when we were still living in the apartment to which we m oved during the Russian period."

Look how well I\u2122m doing in my practice.\ufb02 So, independently of his parents, but my grandfather was a big merchant in the grains \u0152 import and export \u0152 and, we had at least one warehouse that I was aware of with elevators in front of it, railroad tracks, right at the pier, because he exported a lot to England and elsewhere, but one of my relatives told me that we had another warehouse on the other side of the pier exactly facing it. This I don\u2122t know. Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one because it was not sold until the late \u201a30s, the other one.

Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over here is that when the governor of St. Petersburg came to Libau, he would always come to Libau and play bridge with my gr andfather, and they were very good friends, but I would think that the big money came fr om my grandfather.

We were very well behaved to the best of our ability, and this goes also for the \ufb01less fortunate\ufb02 people because I think that even the less fortunate people before the war, there was a common level of behavior that embraced the, I would say, what I knew of the Jewish community, but as I proven wrong about saying that there were no poor Jews in Latvia, maybe I just didn\u2122t wa s not in touch with other elements. But, after the war and during the war when I spent with many of them from many other levels, I would say that there was very civilized and \u0152 under the worse circumstances- civilized and cultured approach to things, to human beings, to fellow human beings, et cetera. You rarely heard of a Libau Jew stealing something from another Libau Jew, rarely. There were exceptions, and they were caught ant they were punished.

The ____ the commotion in Riga, it was a big city for me in contrast to Libau which was sort of a sleepy, smaller city of some 70,000 inhabitants. Riga at that time had close to half a million people. It was the city of my dreams as a child. So, I imagined Riga when I was being transported, I was thinking of the Riga beaches, the summers we spent there. I was thinking of my aunt\u2122s apartment, the parties. I was thinking of the cafes, of the Riga Zoo, wonderful, wonderful memories. And, then we were told we were coming to Kaiserwald. Kaiserwald was the most ex clusive suburb in Riga at this time. Kaiserwald means the Forest of the Kaiser . And, one of my aunts and my granddad had a beautiful villa there, Kaiserwald, gorgeous. So, I thought, \ufb01Kaiserwald, well, who knows?\ufb02 et cetera.

It was terrible, but it wasn\u2122t enough for me. So, I asked my mother, and she very often was able to throw me her portion, and I ate, and I remember at that time, there was a Mr. Kaufman who was a friend fr om before the war.

I\u2122m very, very hungry.\ufb02 He said to me, \ufb01Geo rge, I wish I had I could give you, but I don\u2122t.\ufb02 And, I\u2122ll never forget this. He died in New York. He was the first chairman of the Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he alwa ys remembered this, and I remember this particular incident as well. But, it was done still. It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr. Kaufman that I addressed him. It was not Ma x or sort of the way we\u2122re accustomed to here. Yes, and then, interestingly enough in this Tanklager, which was a tough place, there was a German guard by the name of Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat the Jews like anything. He came I think fr om Romania or some place from that area, but he liked my mother, and would always address her as Frau Dr. Schwab, and when he was patrolling, he would say, \ufb01You can go into this shack\ufb02 where there was a stove and what we confiscated. We used to call it organizier, we organized something. We stole something \u0152 potatoes so we could sl ice and put it against the oven and roast potatoes. That became a delicacy. So, and he permitted me to go with my mother. So, we could go in. We could warm-up, et cetera . We would have our potato so on and so forth. One day, we were marching toward th e Tanklager again in the winter, and my mother told me she had a terrible case of diarrhea and she doesn\u2122t know what to do. _____ in German. She went over to him and said, \ufb01I really have to step out.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Go ahead.\ufb02 He slowed down the column, perm itted my mother to attend to what she had, and then she rejoined the column. W hy did he do it? I don\u2122t know. My mother was gold blonde, very fair skinned, bluish-grey eyes, looked like a thousand Aryans. Actually, she was told and that was still goi ng back now in Libau, if she wanted to be saved to be taken to Germany, she could be saved. She said, \ufb01I\u2122ll be delighted if I can bring my sons with me.\ufb02 They said, \ufb01No, you can not.\ufb02 Then, she said, \ufb01Then I stay with my sons.\ufb02 And, that was still in Liba u, because they distinguished sometimes the genotype from the phenotype, genetically Jewish versus the appearance, and if your appearance was \ufb01Aryan\ufb02 especially Nordic, which my mother was, then you could manipulate, but she was actually asked. 59"

            "answer": "Well, the beatings were almost nonstop now. The food was even worse than in Kaiserwald. When we worked on the tracks, we were beaten all the time by the Germans and by the non-Jewish couples, even though I learned what a louse means in Kaiserwald, and began the practice of delous ing myself \u0152 the hair and over here and so call in the garb that we had. Now, we were full of lice in Stutthof. The facilities were terrible. Sanitary facilities in Kaiserwald were also bad. For example, the toilet was a kind of an outhouse. It was a square pit, and was \u0152 on top of this what was constructed were columns. Columns was a wooden \ufb01bench\ufb02 maybe six or eight inches and you would have to lift yourself up, that I never fell into the pit was a miracle, and incidentally, there were some kapos that were so bad that they were thrown into the pit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples. But, in Stutthof it all over shadowed Kaiserwald from every point of view, especially the be atings. Now, the interesting part was that the reichsbahn requested that the same people be spent to Stolp. So, I was part of it."

            "answer": "The food was manageable over there, a nd people who worked right near the tracks were able to organize sometimes potatoes, carrots, because they would fall off from the railroad tracks and smuggled into the camps and you could begin to trade a little bit here and there. So, you could augment th e poor food that we got with some of the extras, but a few months later, some peopl e did the same thing, organize some food, and they were caught by the Germans. A nd, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a lesson that theft is punishable. And, what they did was hang the people, and we were forced to march to see the hanging, and th en march around the hangers to see them. How did I survive this one? When it was announced hanging people, I didn\u2122t understand what it means, how a person can hang. Again, it became interesting to me to look at the person hanging. I didn\u2122t understand that this is involved with death. I did not put two and two together. How can a person hang? And, only while hanging did I realize that the person was hanged and it meant actual death. I did not connect this before. So, to me again, it was a kind of a spectacle. Theater of the Absurd, if you want to call it, or somethi ng along those lines. Sick! But I remember the context very well because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted? And, my answer is, folly of youth, did not understand, and number two, and perhaps even 66 more important than this, curiosity because everything interested me especially that what I didn\u2122t understand. And, this happened three, four months before our liberation when the Russians were already on German so il, and also during this period in Stolp, the German Jewish couples began to beha ve atrociously to the Eastern European Jews. When somebody was caught organizing so mething internally or so, he had to receive twenty lashes, and the German Jewi sh couples were only delighted to mete out the punishment. One of them was Kent courik who was particularly brutal. For some reason or other, both of these c ouples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me, maybe because I spoke their type of German, and left me pretty much alone this and that and were actually nice, but they were absolute \u0152 excuse me for using the term here \u0152 bastards. And, I\u2122m jumping now fo rward for a minute. I was in the same hospital, after, right after the war as Ke ntcourik, and I came out of the hospital and was brought back by the British to the rehab ilitation, to the rehabilitation barrack in the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein with one of the British Red Cross cars, ambulance cars, and Kentcourik \u0152 I informed the other guys who were there, fellows, many of them that I was liberated with that Kentcourik was coming out. \ufb01Oh, Kentcourik is coming out. We\u2122ll beat the hell out of him,\ufb02 and Kentcourik came in thinking that\u2122s he\u2122s coming in as a great her o, and chairs flew into his face, this and that, so on and so forth. He was taken back to the hospital seriously injured. He survived this, and after the war he had two daughters, moved with his two daughters to Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don\u2122t remember what happened to his other one, Grunwald, but that was the fate of this German Jewish couple Kentcourik."

I was semi-delirious and I was really starved, and in the shuffle in these thousands of people, I lost Juliu s. I wandered around. British planes were overhead and shooting, and the Cap Arcona was offshore, but there was another ship, the Athens, and we were supposed to line up and get onto the Athens to be taken to the Cap Arcorna. And, I wandered around still, and suddenly, I see a pile of things, and I was in a delirious state by then, a German guard lookin g at it, guns \u0152 all sorts of things, and saw there what I would call today \u0152 it was soap, but I mistook it for bread. I picked it up and I started to eat it, and I couldn\u2122t. I couldn\u2122t bite it. I couldn\u2122t eat it. It didn\u2122t taste like bread. So, I threw it awa y, and I walked over to the guard and said to him, \ufb01May I have a slice of bread?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Why don\u2122t you walk over to this tank? This is a British ta nk. You have been liberated, walk over and you\u2122ll get something.\ufb02 So, I walked over to the tank. The British, I decided to speak English, I said, \ufb01I\u2122m very, very hungry. Can I please ha ve a slice of bread?\ufb02 So, they gave me these cookies, a number of cookies to eat because they didn\u2122t have bread, but it was some sort of cookies."

So, my basic hunger was to an extent satiated, and then I went out myself and I organized some thing also one of those cans I managed to bring back. Suddenly, there\u2122s a knock on the door and several Poles walked in, looked around, and said among themselves, a nd by then I knew some Polish because I lived with Poles at the camps, \ufb01This is our place and out you Jew! Out! You out!\ufb02 He didn\u2122t say Jews, and the Jews said, \ufb01You better get out or else.\ufb02 And, Julius was in the forefront as sick as he was. Those days are over. They left quietly, and we stayed there. Now, while we were still on the barg es, we heard the best news of all that Hitler was killed fighting the Russians. He was killed in Berlin. It was very, very late April. It must have been about the 29 th or 30th of April, just a few days before we were liberated. We were liberated on the third of May by the British. And, the day Germany officially capitulated, I collapsed out of total weakness and I was taken to the hospital in Neustadt in Holstein. The many, many other prisoners from Libau, from Riga, from German Jews that I met subsequently, Czech Jews, so on and so forth were all there, and I stayed for a good number of weeks. I think four or six weeks I stayed there."

Before I go to the Warburg Estate, a group of Russian officers arrived with British officers trying to convince me to go back to Latvia, go back to Latvia, go back to the Soviet Union, et cetera. The answer \u0152 my answer was a categorical no because we made a pact, a family, never go east, go back. You go. We have relatives in England, the United States, and we\u2122re given a name so on and so forth to remember, but never go back, and I said, \ufb01Categorically, I\u2122m not going b ack.\ufb02 The British officers still tried to convince me to go back, and a good number did go back. Some of them are now in Israel. After horror \u0152 after spending horrible ti mes in the Soviet Union in Latvia until the \u201a70s, and I refused to go back. Then, the Brits became suspicious of me that I wasn\u2122t Jewish, despite the fact that I\u2122m circumcised, and put me, brought me, took me to a Latvian children\u2122s home where only Latvian was spoken, where some of the leaders were former patients of my fath er, where they talked about Tievzeme in Latvian, the Fatherland, how eventually we\u2122ll all go back to the Fatherland, et cetera, but this was a little bit strange to me b ecause we had Latvian guards. Some of the Latvians were innocuous. Others were horrible. I believe this guy Cukurs, especially Cukurs. I didn\u2122t feel comfortable there. They also wanted to introduce me \u0152 they had with a woman. This was in ____. She wanted to introduce me to General Dankers who apparently knew my father. General Dankers was one of the sympathizers, Nazi sympathizers who managed to get to Lubek. He headed Latvian troops, so on and so forth. But, which I did not know exactly, but General Dankers just didn\u2122t sound right that I should meet him. In Lubek, she wanted to take me because apparently he knew 75 my father, but when we needed the Latvians, they didn\u2122t come through those who were in the position to come through. One day, when the head, this woman, went to Lubek for a day or so, I decided to run away, and I ran away and I ran all the way to the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein. _____ the DP Camp.\ufb02 But, this was a second time around, not the first time. The first tim e I was brought back to the \u0152 I\u2122m sorry. This was the second time around because the first time after a few days I had a relapse, and I was taken back to the hospital for another twelve days. The second time, it was when they took me to the Latvian children\u2122s home, and after a few weeks, I ran away. I came to the camp which was in this U-boat school, and I went to the bunk where I had originally brought back, the rehabilitation bunk, and I\u2122ve got a bed so on and so forth, and what were the people doing? Pl aying poker. Playing poker. Playing \u0152 what you call it? They cal l it 21? \u0152 Blackjack, blackjack, and making piles of money. In those days, the exchange rate was one dollar to 600 Marks, and I don\u2122t know how I got a few Marks to play also. I figured, \ufb01Why not?\ufb02 And, I had a very good memory, and after a few days, I saw this and I knew every card that had gone out and so on and so forth. I began to play, and I piled in tens of thousands of Marks which translates into dollars, maybe it was twenty or twenty-five dollars, but in Marks, it sounded enormous amount, and then I decided that it\u2122s time for me to see the world."

I went to Hamburg, and I remembered going to a police station saying, \ufb01I looked for so and so.\ufb02 I spoke German, and I didn\u2122t know. So, I was taken to the Warburg Estate in _____, a suburb of Hamburg which the Warburg family had temporarily given over to \u0152 I guess there\u2122s a joint distribution committee of the American Relief Unit to turn it into a children\u2122s home, just a small children\u2122s home. I arrived there, and I was told, \ufb01Yes, I belong there.\ufb02 So, that\u2122s how I arrived. It must have been late summer or early fa ll. I remember a few weeks later, getting an attack, appendix attack. I was operated on. I was all alone. I was scared, in the Altona Hospital in Ham burg. I spoke German. I told them that my father was a gastroenterologist . I spoke German to them. They were very nice to me, but I was still very much afraid. They we re Germans. You don\u2122t know what they can do to me. I thought at that time, and I alwa ys reacted very poorly to ether, and I remember throwing off the mask in those days, but before the war my tonsils were removed also under ether and I reacted very poorly in Riga, and I threw off the mask, which I did again, but next thing I knew I came out of the operation all right. I stayed for a number of days in the hospital. When I was brought back for further recovery to the estate. Now came the issue \u0152 there were several issues. First of all, to find mother, and then I wanted to go to Palestine b ecause there were people from the Jewish Brigade in uniform and out of uniform, lega lly and illegally, Hamburg to train us. Not only to teach us Hebrew, the history of Israel, the history of Pales tine, Jewish History, also Hebrew, mathematics, so on and so forth, but prepare also for Alijah Bet which was illegal immigration. And, the war to an extent, it\u2122s only in retrospect that radicalized me. Why did I su ffer? I suffered because I\u2122m a Jew. Is there anything really to be ashamed of being a Jew? No, I was ashamed when I met the girl that I fancied on the street, and, you know, shame came over me that I could not really talk and I really felt inferior which I never did before. But, this was a kind of a reaction I guess to my timidity at the time to having felt ashamed that I reacted the way I did, and was prepared to go to Palestine, prep ared to take up a gun against the British because they were so horrible also to the Jews not permitting the Jews to come in, giving maybe 1,500 certificates a month, and there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands and Jews who wanted to move to Palestine, so on and so forth, but this comes a little later. When it\u2122s all started, a nd my mother and brother, especially my mother said, \ufb01You go west, never go east.\ufb02 You must remember your relatives in America, and in England. In London, rememb er your Uncle Robert, Robert Schwab. I said, \ufb01Yes, of course. He visited us in Libau. I remember him well.\ufb02 Remember to write simply Robert Schwab, Director Shell Oil, London, England it will arrive because he was one of the heads of Shell Oil, but I had forgotten that he was the director of Shell Oil. So, I wrote, \ufb01Robert Schwab, London, England.\ufb02 It all went through military mail because you could not write. It went through the Joint Distribution Committee. It neve r arrived. To my cousin in Salt Lake City, I wrote, \ufb01Mr. David Alder.\ufb02 He was married to my cousin Anna Alder, who\u2122s in this photograph who went to America, and there I wrote to Mr. David Alder, Director Shell Oil, but he was not Director of Shell Oil, and it arrived to the local manager of Shell Oil in Salt Lake City, letter after le tter. He disregarded it, but one day he decided to look up in the phone book in Salt Lake City who this David Alder was. It turned out that he was the owner of an insurance compa ny in Salt Lake City, David 77 Alder Insurance Company. So, he called Davi d Alder and asked him, \ufb01Does the name George Schwab mean anything to you?\ufb02 He sa id, \ufb01Yes, he is my wife\u2122s cousin.\ufb02 So, this was a first contact. I wrote to my othe r cousin in West Hartford, Broskin, it never arrived because it was just Dr. and Mrs. Broskin, Hartford, Connecticut. It never arrived. But, this man, this one man, im mediately contacted my uncle in London and contacted his sister, his wife\u2122s sister in Hartford, Connecticut. So, they were already now in touch, but my mother knew to write the correct. So, she independently got in touch, and this way we connected. We were able to speak on the phone, on the military phone once a week."

I\u2122m going to help you.\ufb02 And, with the he lp of this person, she was able to write to the United States because again, ever ything had to go through military mail, and through them she found out where I am which the Joint was able to connect me then by telephone to my mother because the Wa rburgs, the Joint Distribution Committee and the American and the English Relief Unit were sort of the heads of the so-called children\u2122s home in the Warburg estate, were able to connect once a week. My mother went to the Joint in Berlin, and I was, of course at the Warburg Estate, and it was prearranged what time we would be talking. So, we started to talk, and in those days, it was not easy to go from Hamburg from the British zone to Berlin because you had to go to the British Sector or the American sector because we had to go by way of the Soviet zone, and it took months before I was brought to Berlin. But, in the meantime, when my relatives found out that I was al ive, they started bombarding me with packages and money, and ever y single letter was five dollars, ten dollars, twenty dollars. Sometimes I received a packag e a day.

So, that\u2122s for that purpose. Now, it may sound ve ry funny, but it\u2122s true. I felt that I was 78 now an independent young man. I\u2122ve gone th rough the camps. I\u2122m going to live the life of my parents, aunts and uncles. I am ri ch. I have now all this coffee, et cetera, and among other things, I managed to get myself a driver with his car.

As long as we were there in the morning for hitamulut is what they called it in Hebrew, the exercises, callisth enic exercises, appearing in class, doing some homework.

Norbert Wollheim became the head of the Jews of the British Zone. And, Norbert was headquartered in Lubek, Germany, and Juliu s would drive him when he had to go to Kiel, to Hamburg, or to ____. So, usually when Julius had to drive him to ____, he had to go by way of Hamburg. So, Julius w ould come to ____ with Wollheim, pick me up, take me to _____ to the DP camp wher e I met Yosele for the first time, Yosele Rosensaft, Manachem\u2122s father, for the firs t time. That was in \u212245 still. And, then would drive me back either to or at times take me all the way to Lubek where I stayed at the Wollheim home with his first wife, beautiful woman incide ntally, and that\u2122s how I reconnected with Julius. This is how I reconnected with Eugenia. They were living in a DP camp in Kiel at the time, and I visited them also in Kiel if Juluis picked me up. I saw Eugenia for the first time sin ce the liberation. And, in the meantime in Hamburg, I did this. I did that."

She said, \ufb01When you\u2122ll be 21, we\u2122ll talk about it, but in the meantime you must also get your education.\ufb02 So, I was combining the two. Anyways, there was a court marshal of me in a basement on Fifty-First Street, Thirteenth Avenue in Borough Park basement, where I was threatened with my life if ever I were to give up the idea of the two sides of the Jordan, traditional Palestine, if ever I were to approach another member of the Stern group that I knew, if ever I were to disclose anything that transpired here in the United States, and our cell structure, so on and so forth. I promised, of course, I wouldn\u2122t do anything of the sort, and they said, \ufb01Fine, these are our warnings.\ufb02 And, this came to me as a terrible shock becau se the movement had become my life, and my closest friends I could no longer see, spend time with, or even talk, and I remember traveling to Brooklyn every morning going to New Utrecht from Manhattan because I loved Brooklyn, and from time to time I would see some on the subway, my buddies, they looked away as if I was a traitor. The way the girl looked away when I had the star, and that affect ed me enormously because the movement was part of my life. This withdrawal, for six months I had difficulty sleeping I remember, and then it went on. In the m eantime, I entered college which I wasn\u2122t very much interested, but the Stern group sa id that we had to go to City College, why? In those days, City College was excellent, because you had a special professor there, Hans Cohen, the father of the study of nationalism, et cetera, and he was 93 teaching there, and some other courses, but especially nationalism, what it\u2122s all about \u0152 implications, et cetera, et cetera. So, I t ook the exam and I managed to get in. It was an eight hour entrance exam in those days, very tough, but I managed to get in, and I worked at the same time to help out. I didn\u2122t want \u0152 I knew that my mother was struggling even though she never said a word, et cetera. So, I wanted to make some money on the side. So, I worked in the library. I worked as a runner for a friend of mine, here in the jewelry district who ope ned a business. So, I managed some way or other always to earn between ten and twenty dollars a week on top of studying et cetera. So, but I did not have to depend on my mother\u2122s meager income. Then, I \u0152 at the beginning, it didn\u2122t interest me very much, the studies, but suddenly, something clicked and I began to read voraciously b ecause my mother kept on saying always, \ufb01You know, a man for me, is not a man without an education.\ufb02 And would say to me, \ufb01How can one really live a life without reading a good book.\ufb02 The literature Pushkin, Lermantov, Thomas Mann et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is part of life.\ufb02 Because they used to discuss it at dinner tables as a child. It didn\u2122t interest me. Characters, who cared? The character\u2122s in a book. Ideas were ridiculous. But, suddenly, something snapped, and I couldn\u2122t stop readi ng, and I began to read a lot, day and night, and what interested me particularly was a history of World War II, and one thing led to the other, led also to literature, led to philosophy, led to even an interest in the sciences. For a while, I thought of studying medicine. I met a young woman who was going to study medicine. Her father was a doctor. She was interested in medicine. So, I figured I would also take some courses, and I took courses along those lines, but I reacted very poorly to formaldehyde. Pus developed under my eyes and we had to dissect pigs and rats, and from all the formaldehyde, I began to get rashes here on the side. So, I really had trouble, not that medicine interested me, but I decided to have something in common with the woman that I thought I fancied. But, so much the better that I didn\u2122t."
