And transported to a collection house where other refugees like us were being accommodated. Slovakia was much less under German occupation than Poland. They came in later on, much more tightly, but at that time you couldn\u2122t function as Jews, but the pressure was much lower. So we were taken to that place and stayed there for a few days. That was sort of like heaven. Cause when I was in hiding, for example, in Poland. I don\u2122t know whether I mentioned it before but the last few months, 42, no almost a year when part of the time, after I joined my aunt in hiding, after November 42, part of the time we were in an attic. That was for a little while and then after that essentially in a barn but buried under straw. So they had to keep the straw to feed the animals, take care of the animals, farm animals. And the farmer had arranged a hiding place under the straw. So this was completely dark. Flashlights only for eating. For sudden. I didn\u2122t have any, I had shoes. The kind of shoes that I came in with and I came in as a seven year old. At that time I was eight. So one year, between seven and eight your feet grow. The shoes didn\u2122t.

I don\u2122t think it\u2122s a situation that can\u2122t happen again but I think it\u2122s a situation that we have to be careful, careful in the sense of watch out for. I think it can happen again. It\u2122s very tempting if you don\u2122t like someone to kill them. And especially if you can get ahold of t heir goodies. Right now, more of it\u2122s going on in Asia than anywhere else or in Africa. But there are islands of hatred in Europe that are still burning bright. Thinking of Yugoslavia for example. So from that point of view, s ome Europeans have learned a lot from World War Two. A lot have learned less. And amnesia is beginning to settle in. There\u2122s not much we can do about it. If they don\u2122t want to learn. So I think the only way to protect oneself against that sort of thing is to do exactly what Israel is doing. To provide stockpiles of atomic weapons. Hopefully never to use them but then your enemies know that you have them."
