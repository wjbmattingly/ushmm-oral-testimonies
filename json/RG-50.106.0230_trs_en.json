Basically crossed the border into Slovak, well what is now Slovakia, not Czechoslovakia. Liptosky Santa Nicholas [ph]. Again I don\u2019t know how mother arranged it but the group was met by a car. And transported to a collection house where other refugees like us were being accommodated. Slovakia was much less under German occupation than Poland. They came in later on, much more tightly, but at that time you couldn\u2019t function as Jews, but the pressure was much lower. So we were taken to that place and stayed there for a few days. That was sort of like heaven. Cause when I was in hiding, for example, in Poland. I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned it before but the last few months, 42, no almost a year when part of the time, after I joined my aunt in hiding, after November 42, part of the time we were in an attic. That was for a little while and then after that essentially in a barn but buried under straw. So they had to keep the straw to feed the animals, take care of the animals, farm animals. And the farmer had arranged a hiding place under the straw. So this was completely dark. Flashlights only for eating. For sudden. I didn\u2019t have any, I had shoes. The kind of shoes that I came in with and I came in as a seven year old. At that time I was eight. So one year, between seven and eight your feet grow. The shoes didn\u2019t. You know my toes were curled up like that and it took a few months to get them straightened out. So where were we at this point. Slovakia."

And a guide took us from the closest railroad station. No, not railroad station. Because we went by car, this was car. On the Czechoslovak side to Hungary. Again walking. Scary moments in trying to cross the border. And you know worried about where 1s the border patrol and all that. Anyway, when we crossed into Hungary I think the guide had an arrangement with the Hungarian border patrol, so first he collected the money from us. And then he reported us to the Hungarian border police and they standing there waiting with a rifle behind the rocks so as we walked by they all of a sudden stepped out.

Because it was, she started being able to get money. There was no money. She had one five dollar bill from before the war which she kept through the worst of all possible times. She kept it in the heel of her shoe. But that was basically the only thing we had. So at that point money started coming in. Enough to, for us to be able to rent an apartment and to live on.

So for lunch we would have to go to restaurants. And it was kind of fun. Hungarian was primitive. Mother\u2019s Hungarian was very primitive. My Hungarian was primitive. I had learned.

            "answer": "Depends who. Germans have. The rest of the world, probably not. What they have learned is if you\u2019re going to kill out a group of people, do it quietly. Don\u2019t leave traces. You see a lot of this in Asia for example. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation that can\u2019t happen again but I think it\u2019s a situation that we have to be careful, careful in the sense of watch out for. I think it can happen again. It\u2019s very tempting if you don\u2019t like someone to kill them. And especially if you can get ahold of their goodies. Right now, more of it\u2019s going on in Asia than anywhere else or in Africa. But there are islands of hatred in Europe that are still burning bright. Thinking of Yugoslavia for example. So from that point of view, some Europeans have learned a lot from World War Two. A lot have learned less. And amnesia is beginning to settle in. There\u2019s not much we can do about it. If they don\u2019t want to learn. So I think the only way to protect oneself against that sort of thing is to do exactly what Israel is doing. To provide stockpiles of atomic weapons. Hopefully never to use them but then your enemies know that you have them."
