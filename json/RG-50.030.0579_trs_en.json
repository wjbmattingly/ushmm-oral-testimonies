So I went ma \u2014 went back to my hometown. You know, I didn\u2019t get a handshake, a greeting? Because I was coming home early, and their husbands were still in the service, they were a little mad about that. So then I got a job the next day after I was discharged, on October the 25\". I got \u2014 come home, next day I went and got a job in the mine 160 for Consolidated Coal. And I\u2019ve \u2014 a year later I got married, I raised a family. I didn\u2019t cry in the booze about anything \u2014 about anything, cause I got a job. And \u2014 which was a good thing I got that job, cause my wife is handicapped now, she can\u2019t walk.

Maybe there won\u2019t be no more wars then. If everybody \u2014 everybody knows about them. But we're not \u2014 we\u2019re not go \u2014 we\u2019re gonna have wars, always. We\u2019ve got it right now o-over there now. Now we got to worry about China. They\u2019ve got a rocket going off and it goes 900 mile, knock out a ship out, out in the middle of the ocean.

            "answer": "Oh, I don\u2019t know. Like this rabbi says, you should talk about it. If I had some maps here, you\u2019d be here a couple days. So I\u2019ll s \u2014 Ill say to each and everybody else, stay out of the war. That\u2019s the only thing I can say, stay away from war. It don\u2019t do you any good. Physically, and mentally, it knocks ya. And you think sometimes you might forget about it, but then something happens, or you read something in the paper, or a magazine, it brings the memory back again. Course in my house, I\u2019ve got books after books about the war. And DVDs, now it\u2019s DVDs, and I got a big stack of them. But they, like Barbara said, my daughter says, you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0579 28 never tell me anything about the war. [indecipherable] I got the books, and the DVDs and all that, reading about it today. I watch everything that\u2019s on TV about the war. War as I knew it and everything else, those programs. And I cuss some of them, I says \u2014 that was my big mistake, you know. It was a big mistake in certain parts of the battle. When we crossed the Moselle river, we lost all those men due to the fact one man, he come down from division and he ordered a third battalion to go and attack at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. You don\u2019t go and attack three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, you wait til morning or night. Broad daylight he ordered attack third battalion go in there. Colonel Roberts. He blamed \u2014 blamed the big wheels for that. He\u2019s dead. And there\u2019s certain instance like that happened during the battle, the whole time. The mistakes they made, I don\u2019t care if [indecipherable] was O.C.S., come out of there, in 90 day wonders. You wonder how they got that, the rank. And they didn\u2019t know any better what I \u2014 what I know. Cause I had a high I.Q. When I went in to the \u2014 took the I.Q. exam out of Fort Mead, mine was very high. They says, oh you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re goo \u2014 eligible to go to O.C.S. And the one sergeant says, well, you can\u2019t go, you got glasses. Well, you see this medal right here, the one in the middle?"
