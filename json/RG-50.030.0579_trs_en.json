And I liked that part down there, because that\u2122s where they sent a ll the women, down there to get away from the bombing. So \u0152 but anyway, on June \u0152 June 23 rd, I think it was, or 24th, I got a letter from my aunt, and she pa ssed away now, but I got a letter from my aunt saying my brother had been killed over in Europe. He was killed on May the 10th. That\u2122s two days after the war he was killed. He was ground crew chief on a B17 out of England. And their plane was flying over, dropping Care packages to Holland and Belgium. He was dropping Care packag es there. An airplane was coming in, another plane was taking off, they come together. Two planes ti \u0152 19 completely burn up. The only way you could identify him is by his teeth, after the \u0152 and he was buried in the cemetery, Cambridge, England. And then my uncle was a grange man, and he says, let\u2122s bring him b ack over to sir \u0152 so we got him arl \u0152 he\u2122s buried in Arlington now. And my sister, she was a \u0152 she retired as a lieutenant in the WACs, she spent her time down in Japan when occupation. So then, what did upset me about my brother, because they didn\u2122t no \u0152 the government didn\u2122t notify me, which they should have. And, we brought him back. But just a lot of things you \u0152 people ask me different questions, and then it starts coming back just plain as day. And I kind of hate that a little bit, because I was trying to forget it. But when I come back, I was \u0152 we come back on a Wednesday, but \u0152 see, my daughter had to go with me, she had to be my caretaker, you know, on the trip, on that trip. And, well, she wanted \u0152 so then, we flew back. We just got back in time when that volcano blew its stack over there, out there, you know. And so we made it in time. Well then, the next day, on Thursday, th e ra-rabbi from synagogue in Wa-Washington, PA, he called. And he\u2122s a jolly fellow, real fat. Beard. Very jolly. And don\u2122t ask me his name, I can\u2122t remember. He says, would you like \u0152 would you speak in front of the congregation on Friday? I said, all right. So I got over ther e, I got to talking to him before he had this \u0152 we had the service on Friday night. And he says \u0152 and he \u0152 he made his talk at the service about us sold iers. He says we should talk and tell about the war. He says, when they don\u2122t, then \u0152 then his whole sermon was about that, we should talk. Well then, he introduced me, and I asked him, I says, how long you 20 want me to talk? He says, about 15 minutes. It was two and a half hours before I got out of there. Them people have all ears and everything else. And I passed out there \u0152 I passed 150 of these out to them. And my daughter got them, where she did I don\u2122t know, don\u2122t ask. But I\u2122m \u0152 so then he called me again, he said, why don\u2122t you come back over and do it again, and he says, we\u2122ll tape it. He got \u0152 so I started, from the time I went in the service to almost what\u2122s \u0152 I come home. Took two and a half hours. I didn\u2122t cover all of it, but I cover most of it. And then the \u0152 what was the name of the lady? Sounds like tobacco. Judy , that was it. She called, she wanted me and my daughter to come over and have lunch with them. So we went over there. And it\u2122s quite \u0152 quite interesting. Especially doing the service. And the book was in English, so it\u2122s \u0152 songbook. I sang right around with them."

And when we went over there \u0152 I\u2122ve been over there seven times. We went back first time over in \u212272. And we went over there, we would always look her up. And she took us into Austria this last time we saw her, and her mother is in a nursing home, at that time, I think she\u2122s dead now, in Austria down at \u0152 at Kitschdorf. She had nice apartment, balcony overlooking the Alps , beautiful view from across that valley for Kirshdorf there. And it cost her 28 dollars a month to stay in that apartment building.

            "answer": "Oh, I don\u2122t know. Like this rabbi says, you should talk about it. If I had some maps here, you\u2122d be here a couple days. So I\u2122ll s \u0152 I\u2122ll say to each and everybody else, stay out of the war. That\u2122s the only thing I can say, stay away from war. It don\u2122t do you any good. Physically, and mentally, it knocks ya. And you think sometimes you might forget about it, but then something happens, or you read something in the paper, or a magazine, it brings the memory back again. Course in my house, I\u2122ve got books after books about the war. And DVDs, now it\u2122s DVDs, and I got a big stack of them. But they, like Barbara said, my daughter says, you 28 never tell me anything about the war. [indecipherable] I got the books, and the DVDs and all that, reading about it today. I watch everything that\u2122s on TV about the war. War as I knew it and everything else, those programs. And I cuss some of them, I says \u0152 that was my big mistake, you know. It was a big mistake in certain parts of the battle. When we crossed the Moselle river, we lost all those men due to the fact one man, he come down from divisi on and he ordered a third battalion to go and attack at three o\u2122clock in the afternoon. You don\u2122t go and attack three o\u2122clock in the afternoon, you wait til morning or night. Broad daylight he ordered attack third battalion go in there. Colonel Roberts. He blamed \u0152 blamed the big wheels for that. He\u2122s dead. And there\u2122s certain instance like that happened during the battle, the whole time. The mistakes they made, I don\u2122t care if [indecipherable] was O.C.S., come out of there, in 90 day wonder s. You wonder how they got that, the rank. And they didn\u2122t know any better wh at I \u0152 what I know. Cause I had a high I.Q. When I went in to the \u0152 took the I.Q. exam out of Fort Mead, mine was very high. They says, oh you\u2122re \u0152 you\u2122re goo \u0152 eligible to go to O.C.S. And the one sergeant says, well, you can\u2122t go, you got glasses. Well, you see this medal right here, the one in the middle?"
