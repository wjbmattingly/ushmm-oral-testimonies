It\u2019s not what happened that night a friend of his went to a wedding and he passed across the street to the subway to get the subway from East Broadway and a motorcycle came and on the spot he was dead. So he said there is no insurance in life for anything. If you are supposed to live and you have to live, God helps you. But if you are supposed to die in one minute, you are dead. So then I said whatever it was, we managed Interview with Marcia Loew1 73 and life it\u2019s what you want from life. You\u2019re not here just for our pleasure. We have to be here for other people and whenever we had a friend or my son went to school away to Switzerland and aman came. He was also a Holocaust survivor without a hand. And the principal directed him to our house. It was holiday. So he came. He wasn\u2019t an easy person with one hand and my younger daughter had to take him across the subway. He was scared but my husband said he 1s a guest. You have to treat him better than yourself. And if he needs your bed, you give your bed to him. So he injected it into the children too. And thanks to him we have good children."
