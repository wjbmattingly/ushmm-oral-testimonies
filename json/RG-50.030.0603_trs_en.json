Well, she eventually had to rent out that room, and the lady must have been a Nazi because she gave me a coin for my sixth birthday, and she said, \"Soon we'll have a new picture on the coins.\" And she was very triumphant; you know, she was gloating over this. And then I remember the most frightening thing, wh en the doorbell rang one day. And my grandmother was a little hard of hearing, she didn't hear, and I kept telling her, \"Oma, the door.\" And she went to the door and these two men in Nazi uniform came in with the high, shiny black boots and the whole thing. And they passed through the room where I was, and one of them patted me on the head and said something. And I have no idea what he said, I justI was terrified. And they went into the next room with my grandmother and shut the door. And I heard a lot of talking and then they all came out, and my grandmother came back from closing the front door and she had tears running down her face. And she said, \"We have to move out, we're not allowed to live here anymore.\" And then one dayI don't know how many days after thiswe went to a police station, my grandmother and I, and I believe she got a stay, you know, she didn't have to move immediately, because we stayed there. But I remember the police station, the big picture of Hitler and the flags and so on, which I found very frightening, but she seemed relieved, and I'm sure it's becau se she got this stay, she didn't have to leave immediately."
