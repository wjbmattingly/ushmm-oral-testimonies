            "question": "What languages?",
            "answer": "What languages. Well, I was born w \u0152 my \u0152 my original language was the Austrian version of German, which incide ntally has always been a little bone of contention between Germans and Austrians. Austrians feel that the only correct and proper German is spoken in Austria, and different parts of Germany make the same claim. Hamburg , for instance, han \u0152 Hannover , they think that\u2122s \u0152 they also think that the claims by the others ar e absurd, and \u0152 and funny. I learnt a little French as a small child, we had a French teacher, a Madame come to the apartment and \u0152 and purportedly teach us French, my sister and myself. It didn\u2122t really work, didn\u2122t go much beyond \ufb01Fr\u00e8re Jacques.\ufb02 And we didn\u2122t really like her; that didn\u2122t help. And \u0152 however, when \u0152 in my scho ol system, we took a fir \u0152 a foreign language from the age of 11, and I chos e French. The teacher who taught French also taught German and was the fore-m aster of my class. So he was the administrative, disciplinary head of that class. And he wa \u0152 turned out to be one of the well known arch-Nazis of Vienna. A published author, who when the Austrian Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 5writers club, the Pen Club, the International Pen Club, Austrian branch sent a telegram to their Jewish colleagues in Germany to express their sympathy upon their book burning and treatment, there were two Austrian authors who refused to sign the otherwise unanimous declaration, and he was one of them. I got barely passing grades in German, which was my be st subject, and I switched to the English class because of him. Solely because of him. So I had four years of high school English and I thought I spoke fluent English. That was disillusioned fairly quickly upon arrival in England, but I could get by fairly well. I learned a little Spanish before I left. This was really emigration learning other things ty pe of thing. But I don\u2122t think there was enough of it to have any impact."

            "question": "Where were you on V-E day, when victory was declared in Europe ?",
            "answer": "Victory in Europe. I\u2122m trying to think. The \u0152 the \u0152 strangely perhaps, the impact was not enormous on us becaus e we had felt pretty solidly that we had won, so the \u0152 the fact of the \u0152 of it becoming official was relatively minor. The date, if I recall, was May \u0152 May eight, May eight. At May eight, I believe I was in cadet school in England, and there was a little bit of razzmatazz of people celebrating, cheering, what have you. And it \u0152 I think many of th e cadets thought that now they were more likely to go to the Orient than before. And that concerned me only marginally because I thought the British would surely send me somewhere where my fluent German would make sense. I \u0152 I made so me halfhearted efforts to get sent to Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 6Austria because that would have intere sted me, and besides, being to Germany for the first time ever, during the fighting, and I had a distaste for going to Germany. Some of our people were there and sort of lived it up in occupation, but didn\u2122t attract me. The \u0152 the \u0152 the problem as to \u0152 who was and who wasn\u2122t a Nazi and so on had already come up when \u0152 when we were fighting in Germany. And I was told that chances of getting to Austria were minimal because they were being supplied from central Mediterranean forces, meaning from Italy, whereas Germany was being supplied by personnel from northwest Europe, from \u0152 from our end. Th-The \u0152 the army has its own ways and when it came up, where I did go was West Africa."

            "question": "Before I have you going to West Africa , can you tell me, in May of 1945, what was your rank, and what \u0152 what action had you seen during the war.",
            "answer": "St-Starting at the beginning, when I wa s in the Pioneer corps, I was a private and I saw no chance of ever getting promoted to anything, because I was just one of the younger lads who was unloading trains or testing bridging material and so on. And I \u0152 I wasn't one of the boot polisher and butto n polishers, so I \u0152 I wasn't a standout to the people on the parade ground by any means. In-In fact, I was a bit of a nonconformist [indecipherable]. I was more likely to get in trouble about something than I was to get promoted. So, when I came to the commandos, just prior to D-Day, I was made a lance corporal, which was a big deal. It \u0152 it\u2122s nothing Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 7really, but as such I was the second in command of my detachment, a five man team, attached to number six comma ndo, we were number 10 commando atattaching teams to eight different commandos for D-Day. So, I was a lance corporal and was subsequently promoted to be a corporal in the field, which caused a little argument because I said to my colleague and sergeant, who said, I\u2122m making you a corporal and I said, you know, jokingly, want me to stitch on an extra stripe here in \u0152 in the front line? And he said, you\u2122re damn right. And I said I \u0152 you \u0152 you mean you have the authority to make me a paid corporal? And he said, who said anything about paid? And I came back as a corporal, largely because one of our detachments had been wiped out and I became a one man detachment. When I came back I was promoted to sergeant and when we went out to Holland and Germany again, I was a sergeant. And it was then that one of our own, who had be en \u0152 who \u0152 who had become the commanding officer of our detachments, Kurt Gowza (ph) who served under the name of James Griffith, wanted to send me to cadet school. And I said, at this stage, it\u2122s late in the war, do you think it\u2122s worthwhile? And I don\u2122t want to do the parade square bashing and \u0152 and \u0152 and pamphlet bullshitting, I just don\u2122t want to do it. And he persuaded me to do it, with the help of the brigade major, Sir Maxwell Hopagow (ph). He \u0152 they \u0152 they li \u0152 I wanted to talk to the brigadier, if \u0152 if \u0152 if a commission then happened in the field, Montgomery was against commissions in the field unless from dire need, casualties, because he said it leads Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 8to fraternization through the enlisted men. Which we thought was just fine, and he apparently as a [indecipherable] thought was in \u0152 improper. This is sort of regular army smokiness, you know, and \u0152 and he s \u0152 he stopped quite \u0152 quite a few of us got commissions in the field because they we re doing a good job. And I \u0152 I fairly likely m-might have gotten one, but when I was transferred from one unit to the other, I had to start from square one to build my reputation of being keen and determined and willing to do anything and so on. Which I did. And it led to the i \u0152 the notion of going to cadet school. I went to cadet school, and I must say I had a ball. The fact that I \u0152 I m \u0152 I remember arriving and there were a whole bunch of youngsters out of \u0152 out of school who were going to cadet school and they were studying pamphlets. And they ask questio ns from the pamphlets and I had no idea what th-the answers were, b-but I said, I don\u2122t know the name of the plunger of the \u0152 this weapon, but we had a rather speciali zed version of that weapon for a special operation. Then suddenly everybody is listeni ng and they want to know. Well, when it came to the tests, the same thing happened. Some \u0152 some weapon sergeant would ask questions and say, ask me about the Sten gun. I said, Sten gun was not a commando weapon, we used Thompsons, which are a higher quality. And the only Sten gun I\u2122ve ever seen was one \u0152 a special one for an operation with a silencer. He said, a \u0152 a Sten with a silencer? I\u2122ve never seen one. Tell me about it. I said, I\u2122ll draw you a picture. And we talked about the Sten with the silencer for the rest of Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 9the examination. He said, I assume you we re a weapons instructor. I said, I\u2122m not supposed to comment. You abandon your ra nk when you are a \u0152 a cadet. But some lance corporal who was \u0152 had the job of taking the stripes off, relished to take a sergeants stripes off, you see, so he had slashed the sleeve of my best uniform and there were cuts where my stripes had been. And the weapon instructor sergeant who was doing the testing assumed \u0152 he could see I\u2122d been a sergeant by \u0152 by the cuts on my arm. Well, I \u0152 I breezed through this whole thing like nobody\u2122s business and then \u0152 then came to cadet school, and there I was quite determined to be a nonconformist and a rebel when nonsense was being talked about, you know, pamphlet stuff, and \u0152 which often is \u0152 is outdated and \u0152 and \u0152 and has been written, who knows for whom, and \u0152 and I would \u0152 I would say \u0152 well, for instance a question. What use is the Bren gun carrier? Hands go up and the cadets \u0152 the cadet kept asking questions, you see. And they sa id, to carry out flanking attacks, and somebody else said something else, and when it was my turn, I said none. The Bren gun carrier is no use. I have seen more burnt out Bren gun carriers than \u0152 than nonburned out Bren gun carriers. It\u2122s a little [indecipherable] not enough armament. And I said, it is useful possibly for two th ings, which is to bring up the tea after battle, or if you have nothing and want to fake like you have armor, you run them off somewhere where nobody can see them and the enemy will think you\u2122re coming with a lot of tanks, because they make such a racket that they inevitably get shot at Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 10and \u0152 and \u0152 and then that\u2122s when they burn. And the instructor said, th-that Masters is absolutely right, because he had just come back from Italy himself, so he knew what I am saying is true, you see? So \u0152 so after awhile I found out wasn\u2122t that much \u0152 I mean, I wa \u0152 it wasn\u2122t working the way I had thought. I \u0152 I thought I\u2122d be a rebel and I found the management agreed w ith me. Which was in a way, of course, a big help and gratifying and so I graduate d very high in my class, and that\u2122s the end of that one. Tha \u0152 you asked me what rank I was when I graduated. I was, of course, a second lieutenant and was subsequently promoted during my service in Africa, aut \u0152 almost automatically to first li eutenant and then my time was up. Six years. It was age plus length of service in the British army. So my number was up and I \u0152 somebody wanted me to stay as an instructor at the school of infantry and I said thank you but no thank you. Why not? Well, I said, I n \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I relish the illusion of freedom, that I can go wherever I want, whenever I want and not be sent. I\u2122ve been sent for a number of years now. So even bef \u0152 realizing it\u2122s an illusion, enough."

And then they \u0152 th-the \u0152 th e people in charge always Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 11stretched what was an initial assault way beyond our normal role, because we didn't have heavy support weapons, you know.

We knew that my \u0152 my \u0152 my grandfather was murdered in Auschwitz and we knew that were a number of distant relatives had \u0152 had \u0152 had perished. And other than looking for individu al friends here and there, and \u0152 and fi \u0152 si \u0152 later finding some, not very much finding materialized. There were things like getting in touch again with people who had gone to Israel. Friends. Getting in touch Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 12again with such people as my kinderfraulein, my nanny in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 who had been in Austria throughout the war. In fact, we invited her to come and visit in London, and that was very exciting. So, not mu ch in the way of \u0152 of finding people that had \u0152 that had disappeared. There were some weird things. My \u0152 my mother lived in an apartment in London and once went to a ne ighbor to borrow some wrapping paper for a package she had to make in a hurry. And the woman said, well, I have this one, you can turn it ove r, it\u2122s used. And on the reverse side were names and addresses of my father\u2122s ne phew \u0152 two of my father\u2122s nephews in New York. Since my parents were divorced, my mother never pursued that. And I tried much later to see what I could find it, found some people by this un \u0152 very unusual name in \u0152 in the telephone directory and called them up and they said, it\u2122s just a name we call our firm, and there\u2122s no one he re by that name. But, it went off into the sand, nothing happened. Of course, you know, people still appear nowadays here and there, and that could theoretically happen. My \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m still looking for some of my classmates and when I came to Europe I used to read the telephone books wherever I was, to see what I could find. And sometimes I\u2122d find a name and sometimes I\u2122d pursue it and call up for some classmate or other, and not find them at home, or in the country or something. And it never really led anywhere. If I came back a few years later and looked in the phone book again, maybe a name was missing and I assumed the person died, or moved. So it \u0152 not \u0152 not \u0152 not very much. Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 13And by now, anyone older than I is likely to be dead. I mean, purely, technically, you know, you \u0152 I-I\u2122m 76 years old.

So you \u0152 you find that \u0152 that some of this is \u0152 is quite \u0152 quite hopeless. When I was in London just now, a friend of mine whom I haven\u2122t seen since 1940-something, actually came from Munich to spend the day with me and we talked all day long about the old times. He was especially good friend. I would never have \u0152 I would never have recognized him in \u0152 in the street, or [indecipherable].

            "question": "Before I ask you about your service in Africa , which I will do in a minute, I wanted to ask you, when did you realize the full ex tent of the genocide in Europe?",
            "answer": "This is a question I \u0152 that is very difficult, and I have asked myself that, because no \u0152 many a time still, it\u2122s very, very hard to answer, because the fact that people were being killed became known almost immediately. And by that I mean the anschluss was in 12th of March 1938. At that time people were arbitrarily arrested. The brutality in Austria was much more immediate th an the gradual tightening of the noose in Germany. Which of course was a good thing, except if it happened to you. A good thing in that it scared you into action, which it didn\u2122t do for many people in Germany, because it just got a little worse all the time. Well, in Austria Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 14the brutality was immediate and many people said, let\u2122s get out of here and \u0152 a \u0152 or, any border, quick. And not enough people said that and \u0152 and \u0152 but \u0152 but those who did benefited from that scenar io. Oh, people were arrested and in the beginning one asked naively, why were they arrested. And then there were some black humor jests. They were arrested because they had eggs for breakfast. You know, the people were still joking about this sort of thing. And then some of these neighbors or friends who had been arrested, actually we re released. And some of them were in very poor condition, having been beaten and goodness knows what. So [indecipherable] became aware that people were being tortured or beaten. And then in some cases one hear d that the family received an urn with ashes, saying, shot while trying to escape. Well, shot while trying to escape. If this was some very peaceable neighbor, you know \u0152 knew them well, that this was not a man who was going to escape from \u0152 from benevolent deten tion. So there began to materialize a certain awe of, are they coming for me, if they\u2122re co ming for me, what will happen to me? Are they coming for my relatives? Should one wo rk more actively on getting out, and \u0152 and so on. And this is \u0152 was a gradually increasing image, and I have a memory. I haven\u2122t researched this, but I have a memory that there \u0152 I went to the movies once in England, and there was a movie \u0152 there\u2122s \u0152 there was a group, you know, like the Stoogies, called The Crazy Gang. Funny people in \u0152 you know, in \u0152 in \u0152 movie comedians. And the thi ng was called, The Crazy Gang in a Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 15Concentration Camp. Now, that\u2122s appalling, isn\u2122t it? I mean, I \u0152 I \u0152 I suppose in a way some of this Stalag 17 series became from a serious film into a TV series that was humorous. It was a comical German and y-y-you remember that thing? Well, The Crazy Gang in the Concentration Camp. One should really try and fish that out and look at it and see how \u0152 how appalling it \u0152 it might well be. But it shows you the scenario that some people who were aware of the fact that there are concentration camps thought it was a s ubject matter for a comical film. Now [indecipherable] seen from this end of \u0152 of \u0152 of history or time. So, what I\u2122m using it for here is to illustrate the unawareness of some, how real and how serious it was, and yet the awareness of others, but \u0152 but shout it in an ominous [indecipherable] of \u0152 of nothing, behind which you could not look. And that built and built and built and built until it became a fu-full awareness. When, I cannot put a date on that. Then there \u0152 there were stories, and I do n\u2122t remember any more whether we heard them then or later, of the man who tried to make \u0152 make the \u0152 the \u0152 the British awa \u0152 government aware \u0152 or first of all, tried to make his Jewish neighborhoods in Poland aware and went from village to village saying, Juden es brennt.

            "answer": "Well, first of all, I had an attitude, which said, as Kurt Vonnegut says, unexpected opportunities to travel are dancing lessons from God. And I would never have gotten to Africa, to West Africa in normal circumstances in my life. And I really relished the idea. So there was a shipload of \u0152 of young officers who were to go to Africa, amusingly, on a ship called the Jan Sobieski. That doesn\u2122t mean anything to you, but Jan Sobieski was a king of Poland who was responsible for the relief of Vienna from the Turkish siege. He came with the Polish cavalry and relieved fa \u0152 Vienna and \u0152 and saved western civilization, from what was probably a superior civilization of the Tu rks but we are \u0152 haven\u2122t gotten to admit that yet. They had social services far adva \u0152 in advance of what western civilization Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 17had. Well, the \u0152 the \u0152 that \u0152 th-there in \u0152 in the \u0152 in the lounge was this great big portrait of Jan Sobieski and I was the only passenger on that ship who knew who it was. We went to Africa and the purpose to send us was to train native troops as aid to civil power. Because the British had not yet decided to relinquish the empire. And in case they decided to hang onto the empire, they needed military support, ideally from the local population, hopefully. Well, we didn\u2122t ever say that. What we were doing is we were training native troops to wipe out remaining pockets of Japanese resistance in remote parts of th e world. You know, there were Japanese soldiers who were holed up on some Pacific island, I mean, Oriental \u0152 in the Aleutian islands, wherever, and who either ha dn\u2122t heard that they had surrendered 20 years previously, or \u0152 well, at that time not 20 years. And every now and again one of them would come out. Well, we were training our people to \u0152 our \u0152 our native Ghanaians -- before there was a Ghana [indecipherable] to wipe out these pockets of fanatic resistance. But what we were really doing is training them, you see, to civil power. And I was greatly helped by my attitude, I really liked them. And they really liked me. They had nicknames for everybody. I was called lieutenant aero-plane driver. That was because I wore parachute wings, which \u0152 for which I had qualified, and they saw wings and they though wings must be an aeroplane, and what do you do with an aero-plane? You drive it. So I was lieutenant aero-plane driver. And I talked to them, which many did not. And found it most Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 18instructive, the different philosophy, just beginning to be materialistic, but by and large, not materialistic. No work ethic. Now, you have to picture that. We are so steeped into our work ethic that we say, if you are industrious you will be rewarded. They say, do-do \u0152 don\u2122t \u0152 don\u2122t make work . If things grow by themselves, then sow them and then go and harvest them, but you don\u2122t have to work in between."

[break] \u0152 uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape one, side B. Okay, we\u2122re back and you were telling me about your experiences in Africa and you were talking about the work ethic.",
            "answer": "Yes, well, the \u0152 the Africans were really just beginning in \u0152 i-in that area. I mean, the present \u0152 the Africans would resent my saying some of these things because they want to be contemporary, modern people. And that\u2122s fine, although one can\u2122t help but deplore losing certain things. For instance, the most important thing to the men was to talk. They would sit under a shady tree and talk and talk and talk. And that was not something that you would say they are lazy and good for nothing. No, they were doing an important thi ng, they were talking. It\u2122s true that \u0152 that that meant more work for the women, but the tradition of that, I guess is so ancient that it \u0152 it isn\u2122t a thing where you had the feeling that there\u2122s going to be a feminist movement saying let the women sit and talk, let the men carry the logs. Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 19You know, it is a peculiar \u0152 a peculiar attitude that said \u0152 that admired certain things. I can give you some sample convers ations that are favorites of mine. That the European or American countries is showing off too, what they can perceive to be a primitive culture. And so you show th em a picture of the Golden Gate bridge. And they say mm, fine bridge. And then co mes a little noise, that you learn to hear. It is ah. It\u2122s just a little doubt in the admiration. And they say, this bridge, fine bridge. What is it for? A very basic question. You say well, it\u2122s so people, obviously, can get from one side to the other. Ah, of course. Ah, why do the people from one side want to go on the other side ? Well, some people work on one side and live on the other. Ah, ah yeah. There\u2122s no work on the other side. I said, yes, there \u0152 there is work on the other side, but some of them \u0152 and so it goes. And then I say, well, you\u2122re giving me a hard time because obviously they are leading me on, you see. You build bridges, you have brid ges for \u0152 so, I mean, this is just a \u0152 a bigger bridge. Yeah, fine bridge. Ah, how long it take to build this bridge? How much did it cost? Well, they have you, you know, I mean th-the \u0152 then \u0152 you now would have to demonstrate that it is ec onomically worthwhile to build all our bridges and that it pays, and \u0152 and \u0152 and th at it\u2122s \u0152 makes more sense than \u0152 and so on and so on and so on and so on. And th is goes on and now I offer you \u0152 imagine what happened when one of the young officers committed suicide. British officers. Far away from home for the first time, unhap py, hot climate, who knows? I was the Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 20mentor because I was the one they \u0152 that talked to them. So the natives gathered around me and said, why? And I said, he had \u0152 he was lonely, he had few friends. You\u2122re not his friend? I said yes, I tried to be his friend, but he was unapproachable, I couldn\u2122t get to him. How is he better now than he was when he was lonely? I\u2122m getting into theology here or whatever, you see, I mean I \u0152 so I say \u0152 I counterattack. I said, there\u2122s nobody ever committed suicide here, your people? That caused a huddle and a long discussion and then they came back and said, maybe two people \u0152 no, maybe one lot of people, and then another person. And I said, when you mean \u0152 when \u0152 when you sa y a lot of people \u0152 well, long time ago, the story, king died. King had 40 wives. Wives were singing pious songs and walked into a swamp, to accompany the soul of dead king. Don\u2122t know whether it\u2122s true. Is that suicide? I said, well, I suppose so, I don\u2122t know. What\u2122s the other one? There was this crazy woman, and some people say she jumped into a well, deep well, died. Some people say somebody pu shed her into the well. Some people say she fell into the well. But some people say jumped into the well. That\u2122s the only one we can think of. And I said, well what does a person do who is very unhappy? You ca \u0152 you can\u2122t tell me everybody\u2122s happy a ll the time. Oh, he go for bush. That means into the jungle. Maybe drink some palm wine. Go to sleep. Wake up, everything fine. Not bad. You see? So \u0152 so \u0152 so I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m literally learning in many ways, because we are so assuming that in our self righteousness that what we Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 21do is absolutely the only way, and in a way it explains that when \u0152 when \u0152 when slavery used some of these very places as a source, and transposed forcibly people who did not have a work ethic and suddenly told them they had to work God knows what hours, that it was very tempting to say they are go od for nothing and lazy. And they were not good for nothing and lazy, we were stupid. And now all over the world everybody\u2122s sins are coming home to roost. The British empire has fallen apart and they are all coming to Britain and \u0152 and they used to sneer at the United States for having racial problems, and they\u2122ve been relatively quiet recently.

            "answer": "Well, in a word yes. Not-Not \u0152 not \u0152 not that specifically. I had a \u0152 as a specialist, and a \u0152 a fluent German speaker trained in the German armed forces, my last attachment was with all Marine commandoes and the colonel, who was a great soldier, was quite fond of me and after the war we had a drink at the Army-Navy club in London. He introduced me to some retired Marine general and \u0152 who \u0152 who told me how fortunate I was that I had the honor and privilege to serve with Marines \u0152 Marine commandos. And the colonel a-as ked, what are you doing now? And I said, I\u2122m going to art school, because I \u0152 that\u2122s was \u0152 I was going to be a di \u0152 Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 22graphic designer. And he said, lord bless my soul, whatever for? And I said, I want to be a graphic designer. He said, well, if you are stuck for anything \u0152 for something to do, I am taking up my post as inspector general of the Palestine police, and I \u0152 there\u2122ll always be a job for you. I said, thank you very much sir. And my mother had mentioned that to a visiting friend from Israel, my th \u0152 as a son of my grandfather\u2122s partner. And he said \u0152 she \u0152 she \u0152 she mentioned the colonel first of all, before all this took place. And he said he won\u2122t live long. And I said \u0152 my mother said, good heavens, why? And he said, well we have very \u0152 engaged in a war to shake British domination of \u0152 of \u0152 of what is promised us under the Balfour Declaration. And sh \u0152 if he is in charge of the Palestine police then i-is \u0152 there is something very close to total war between us. And so a few days later this conversation I had at the Army-Navy club was reported to him and he said, he should take it. And my mother was outrage d, she said, you just said that the man he\u2122d be working with isn\u2122t \u0152 may not live long and now you want my son to be in that position? And he said, it might be very useful to have somebody in there. And my mother said, but you said it\u2122s very dangerous. And he said, dane \u0152 what\u2122s dangerous? Walks across Piccadilly and a tile falls off a roof and kill you. That\u2122s dangerous. But Mother was not convinced, and \u0152 and i-i-it didn\u2122t happen. Now, it\u2122s also true that there were services annually, memorial services, what have you, in Westminster Abbey and so on. And my \u0152 some of my fr \u0152 I didn't attend any, Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 23maybe one, I can\u2122t remember. And a \u0152 some of my friends told me they went to it and as they came out there were people on either side of the entrance saying psst, come here, I want to talk to you. And apparently they were recruiting. The \u0152 the Israelis were recruiting, that is the \u0152 the Irgun, or whoever, or the Stern gang, or I \u0152 I don\u2122t know. And on the other side the Ar abs were recruiting, because they were recruiting for the Arab legion and for wh at have you. And one of the commando colonels came to command the Arab legion, Brigadier Young, whom I knew well in Normandy and \u0152 and so you see, there were both sides, very weird for \u0152 for commandos. I mean, there was a demand for trained people. That still goes on in a way, because when I gave a book talk in Florida, a young man came in with a Rottweiler on a leach \u0152 leash and I \u0152 I-I was amazed they let him into the bookstore, and he said, can \u0152 do you live in this area? And I said no, I\u2122m just here for a few days. And he said, that\u2122s too bad, and I said why? And he said, I belong to a group that is very interested in comma ndo training. So you see, there are jobs everywhere."

            "answer": "I first heard about it when I was maybe eight or nine years old, or maybe a little younger. We had a game where you had to pick a nation, you represented that nation. And then when that nation was ca lled you had to pick up the ball and hit somebody with it. You know, throw at them. And there was one boy who always Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 24said, Palestinian. It was Jewish boy. A nd I \u0152 I must have asked him, why do you want to be a Palestinian? And he said, that\u2122s the country of our future. Obviously a \u0152 from a Zionist family. And I said why? And he said \u0152 he explained it to me as best as a young child could. And I was extr emely puzzled, because we were so integrated into Viennese middle class society, that the reaction would have \u0152 was why would we go and sit in the desert and become a part of some agrarian society when we are in an intellectual society here and part of [indecipherable] . And so it took quite awhile to understand what this was all about. And of course, a lot \u0152 a lot of the most material contribution ca-came from Hitler, where people suddenly realized that however integrated the \u0152 and accepted or honore d they thought they were, that didn't count any more. So, the notion of living there didn\u2122t really occur until relatively recently when it\u2122s part of a very broad overall attitude of mind that I have felt that I could live anywhere and \u0152 and relish living anywhere and become part of living anywhere. And I\u2122ve \u0152 I\u2122ve only been to Israel once, and it was absolutely wonderful, and if I haven\u2122t recently gone back, it\u2122s largely because I have ma \u0152 we have discovere d some distant relatives who want to take over if we go there, and we are a little afraid of that because we\u2122d rather be our own \u0152 determine on our own where we want to go, what we want to do.

I-I had hoped by the choice of my regiment and because I gra duated high, you get your first choice to get to Oxford , because I chose to be commissioned in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry. And I made mistake. They didn't send me to Cowley Barracks in Oxford, they sent me to Colchester [indecipherable] city, but brimful of soldiers. I was in para \u0152 in a barracks where there were three light infantry regiments. Each one had a different drill, totally different drill. So that if you were orderly officer, which you were often, as a junior Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 26officer, you had to get the orderly sergean t, who was usually an old hand, and put coins on the table. This half crown is me, this florin is you, this sixpence is the bugler, these are the ranks. And now, there were no words of command, it was all done silently and precisely and we marc hed together for 12 paces and halt. We about face, we do this, we do that, we [indecipherable] bugle \u0152 bugles and [indecipherable] . And the town would gather around the parade square, they would know it better than I did, certainly. There was, for instance, no ceremonial march past for the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire . It was a bubble past, being light infantry, so you ran 12 abreast at the bubble, in step, in line and you were the officer out in front saluting the pedestal where th e commanding officer stands. And if they don\u2122t look lined up properly or in step properly, it\u2122s your fault, although you haven\u2122t the slightest influence what\u2122s happe ning behind you. I al so discovered that \u0152 so I had to learn three different drills. I also discovered that the \u0152 one of the reasons I had chosen the \u0152 the Ox and Bucks is because their airborne battalion had taken the bridges on D-Day and we linked up with them, and they had done a beautiful job taking these bridge intact. And they were delighted to see us, and we them. It turned out they were persona non grata in their own regiment, because the regulars at the base considered them irregular forces, air landing people [indecipherable] pilots, parachutists, what have y ou, as I was, you see? So the ones with the maroon beret of the airborne were looked at askance, and me with a green Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 27beret is even worse. And I \u0152 I couldn\u2122t wait to get out of there, which I managed first of all to be sent to the school of infantry, and that was a course, company commanders course. And that\u2122s when the majo r there said didn\u2122t I want to stay as an instructor, because we hit it off perfectly. It was the same principal as the cadet school, I was telling them how it was and th ey agreed, because they were veterans from this campaign or that. And I turned it down for the illusion of freedom that I described to you. Well, after that, West Africa and happy to get out of this place where the people seemed to have the attitude that these irregular force pe \u0152 members were coming to take their jobs away [indecipherable] headquarters and God, I would have paid not to take it away, you know? I \u0152 I \u0152 I wa \u0152 I wanted out, out. It\u2122s terrible.

And he ad vised me what to do with my cartoons, which he liked very much. And I had an interview with \ufb01Punch.\ufb02 He said, you start at the top. I said, you mean at the bottom? He said no, at the top. If you can\u2122t hack it, you go down one rung. Wisdom. Well, th ey bought two ideas for cartoons and I was so rich that I couldn\u2122t believe it. But this is before the commandos and the Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 28Pioneer corps. I-I got paid like for several months salary for two ideas. And I thought this is a lovely way of making a living. These were not political cartoons, they were like \ufb01New Yorker\ufb02 type cartoons. And I drew a nother batch and I said I would throw a party for the whole platoon, and the \u0152 nothing seemed to happen and then a terrible thing. Well, I went to the local pub where I was well known and I said, I-I must give this party. I have a whole batch of cartoons out there and when they come in I\u2122ll have plenty of money and right now I don\u2122t. And they gave me credit and I threw a party, all the beer yo u can drink for the whole platoon. And the check hadn\u2122t come yet, th-the second installment, but after the party, I think one or two days later, it came saying the editor regret s at this time we are not buying any of the cartoons. And now I had absolutely six months to pay it off, you see. And I didn\u2122t draw a cartoon for a year and a half, in utter depression. Now, I still thought that in that direction was my \u0152 my \u0152 my future profession. I came out of the army and I made one brief attempt. I talked to a friend of my family\u2122s who was a \u0152 a s \u0152 journalist. And she wrote th ings about resorts who then gave her a limousine, and you know the bit. One of my daughters says it\u2122s half a step from prostitution, not journalism, but that\u2122s a matter of t \u0152 pe rsonal taste. Anyhow, I asked her, do you think there would be some opening as an apprentice journalist somewhere? And she said no, completely hopeless. You might sell one story about your war experience, maybe, but doesn\u2122t amount to much, everyb ody has stories. And I gave up. She\u2122s Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 29still writing a \u0152 a Austrian cooking column for a Jewish magazine in London, very popular. Written several books, still going to all the best resorts. Well, I thought \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I wrote her a note when my \u0152 when my book came out, and the movie rights were bought. I haven\u2122t heard from her si nce. Anyhow, I gave up and I decided reluctantly I would have to go to school. So, my mento r, who had sent me with the cartoons, you know, to \ufb01Punch,\ufb02 he said, I have a young woman friend who has just graduated from art school, and she said she would be willing to come and meet with you and advise you which school to go to and so on. So we met in his studio and she [indecipherable] sort of snippety, brisk you ng woman, and she said, I went to the Central School of Art and Crafts, it\u2122s \u0152 I consider it the best school. It\u2122s very hard to get in and you probably won\u2122t. And sh \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I said, you \u0152 you\u2122ve graduated from there? Yes, she had graduated from there, and she was a German refugee and she had been president of the student union, an elective office. Not bad for a \u0152 for a refugee. Well, I was this commando first lieutenant, you see, and I decided to go to that school and become pr esident of the student union, as a matter of \u0152 point of honor, you see? And I did both. I \u0152 I daresay my jingling uniform helped a bit to boost my portfolio, but it \u0152 they accepted me and I went to that school and I learned quite a lot. And after three years, my mother drew my attention to a middle paragraph in a paper that talked about Fulbright scholarships. And she said, wouldn\u2122t a graduate year be very beneficial for your career? Well, I had just Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 30begun to go and look for jobs and I found they paid nothing and wanted me to do things that I was not willing to do. I \u0152 I \u0152 I asked one studio where I went for a job, what would I have to show you that you would hire me? And they produced an extremely realistic painting of a plate of bacon and eggs, wi-with fat bubble in the center, and very real. And that\u2122s an illustrator, you know, I mean, I \u0152 obviously whoever was talking to me didn\u2122t understa nd where I came from or didn\u2122t care. Anyway, I \u0152 I said to myself, I shall never be able to do this and what\u2122s more I don\u2122t want to be able to do that. I\u2122m a problem solver, I\u2122m a designer, I \u0152 I\u2122m a \u0152 and for that they were willing to pay, I think, three pounds a week starting salary, and I \u0152 I thought that that was absolutely horrible. And I welcomed the opportunity to apply for the scholarship, for the Fulbright. And I did with full support of the principal of the school, a \u0152 a \u0152 a Scottish painter who was not my friends because as president of the student union, you can imagine we had many, many skirmishes. But he said, America is entering what we entered in the first Elizabethan age, culturally, and you must go there. And o-off I went an d they threw in a summer scholarship at Yale, six weeks. And money was a problem, because sterling was not converted \u0152 not that I had any. But i-it \u0152 it created a problem, because most art schools are not boarding schools. So I had to live somewher e. So I lived at International House in New York, in the cheapest room in the basement, and developed techniques, how to eat for little or nothing. I was also helped by the fact that my mother had a couple of Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 31cousins where I was invited to dinner once a week and they\u2122d give me sandwiches for the next couple of days. And then I\u2122d buy a box of cereal and I\u2122d buy a loaf of bread. And I couldn\u2122t afford the school cafeteria, but I could buy 20 cents worth of bologna or cheese, and that would stretch for a couple of meals with my loaf of bread. And as to \u0152 and \u0152 and a carton of milk, which I put on the windowsill to \u0152 to keep cool. A-And \u0152 and I discovered the Am erican luxury, there\u2122s free sugar in the cafeteria, where you can help yourself, put a couple of pa ckages in your \u0152 in your pocket and with my box of cereal I had br eakfast every morning, and my carton of milk, you know. And it \u0152 it worked. And I started to freelance. There was a woman who did [indecipherable] greeting cards, and I did th e finished drawings. Making the bells on the wedding cards nice and ov al, the polka dots round. And listening to these \u0152 the radio programs of the day, like the trace of lost persons, the FBI and peace and war. I got a whole education. And I worked there some nights a week. And then the father of a schoolmate of mine from Vienna had a business of embroidering blouses, women\u2122s blouses. And he \u0152 he paid for these designs, lots of money. And he didn\u2122t want them finished, he wanted them on tracing paper so he could trace them onto the blouses. Now I employed my best friend to help me, we had so many to do. Unfortunately we discovered it late in the year, but we could actually afford to go to the movies, which we hadn\u2122t been able to do before. Was a sensational year at International House. We put on shows. And if I give you the Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 32cast, let me say that one of our fellow students was Leontyne Price.

My ow \u0152 my own attitude was I could not live in this country, because I\u2122d just been through six years of war against discrimination and I was seeing the newspapers and what have you that din \u0152 di n \u0152 discrimination in this country was rampant. I \u0152 I \u0152 I read the \u0152 the anti-Semitic diatribes of \u0152 of \u0152 on the hill, of [indecipherable] and \u0152 and Father Coughlin(ph) all this was not unfamiliar to me, but then the discrimination against black people seemed totally intolerable. And a couple of things happened. I arrived on the Queen Mary on my Fulbright, and there was a green uniformed customs official who looked at my papers and \u0152 and looked at my \u0152 my suitcase, my shipping trunk, what ever I had brought, and he said, how long do you propose to stay here? And I said, oh I don\u2122t know, I have a \u0152 a year\u2122s \u0152 I mean, a school year\u2122s sc holarship, preceded by six weeks in Yale. And I might hitchhike around a bit to see some of the country. So, it\u2122ll be a year, or \u0152 or maybe 18 months at the most. And he sa id no. And I said, I \u0152 I beg your pardon? And this great big, red-haired Irishman, you see \u0152 I said, you mean I can\u2122t do that? Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 33And to my utter amazement he put his ar m around my shoulder and he said, young man, this is the country to live. And we \u0152 we need young people to come here, and you don\u2122t want to go back after 18 months. And I was co mpletely floored by this, because I had seen customs officials in \u0152 in Austria, in Germany, in France, in Britain, and never had anyone said a fre \u0152 a \u0152 a friendly word. It wasn\u2122t fashionable until that time. Now they say welcome to the country or something, but this is all the last few years, you know. To me, th is was absolutely stunning. I\u2122ve never forgotten it. [break]"

This is tape number two, side A, and you were telling me about coming to this country on what you thought was going to be a temporary excursion and yo ur \u0152 your encounter with a customs officer.",
            "answer": "Well, the \u0152 the s \u0152 the next thing that made a tremendous impression was in this six week course a-a-at Yale, which was for students 20-odd students from different countries all over the world who were coming to \u0152 to study for year, and this was sort of a conditioning, American studies, you know, so they would not get too much of a culture shock because university here was different from university in their own countries. And there were courses in \u0152 in politics and in English and in Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 34literature and so forth. And one of them was in sociology. The professor was a professor by the name of Serge(ph) Yamaki (ph), a Finnish American, young man who was wonderful. I had never had a profes sor like that. He told it how it is, talked straight. He talked about religion in this country. He said there are statistics about how many people go to church. I assure you a percentage, or a large percentage of the \u0152 the majority of people going to church \u0152 to various churches, doesn\u2122t matter which, are going to show their Sunday clothes, or their automobiles, or whatever. It becomes a social thing. It has very little to do with religion. We had a course \u0152 oh, oh and he talked about discrimination and about what must have been the first seedlings of the Civil Rights movement. And he said, this is an uphill struggle, it\u2122ll take a while, but it\u2122s moving along. We ar e correcting. There are \u0152 there are serious attempts to correct the wrongs of the past. And he went into detail saying what people were doing and what was going on and so on. And you had not heard about that in Europe , you only heard about the negative stories. So I became aware that somebody was trying to do something. And th at was \u0152 that \u0152 I\u2122d perhaps been hasty when I said I could never live in a country where these things exist, as long as there were forces at work that were trying to counteract the \u0152 the \u0152 the bad things I had heard. Well then circumstances overtook me. I \u0152 I met my wife again, after we had known each other in London, in fact we had been double dating, but not a-as each other\u2122s partner. And she went to America when the Czech government in exile Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 35collapsed because of the Czech coup in Prague, the communist coup, and she was not going to go back to Prague under the communists. So , she had helped out the second world meeting of the Interna tional Monetary Fund which was in London , and sh-sh-she was o-on loan to them fro m the Czech government be \u0152 just before the coup. And they offered her a job in America and she said, I am very happy here, and when the Czech government collapsed, somebody remembered the \u0152 her job offer and he \u0152 he \u0152 he restated it and she accepted. So she came what she thought was for a year to work for the Monetary Fund in Washington , and she worked there for 36 years. And I came and \u0152 to the United States and one day \u0152 there was a Greek student in International House who said, I\u2122m hitchhiking to Washington, anybody want to come? I said, I know somebody in Washington, let me try and get to a telephone. Well, I tried and \u0152 and they told me that the United Nations were in Flushing Meadows, New York , and I said yes, but a branch, and I got a Russian operator and forget it, I could not convince her that there was any United Nations here, which of course th ere was, the World Bank and Monetary Fund, and a couple of other one. I gave up . So did the Greek chap, by the way. Said, ah, I\u2122m not going. So that was \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122d looked for telephone listings under her name, there was none. Anyway, I \u0152 I just ga ve up. I \u0152 a short while later she went on home leave, which was London, although she is from Slovakia . Ka \u0152 children\u2122s transport survivor. And my \u0152 our mutual friends gave her a book that had just come Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 36out, \ufb01The Green Beret\ufb02 by Hilary Saint George Saunders. It was the first book about the commandos by a historian. And they said, bring that to Peter. And she said, where? He\u2122s in New York. Really? I\u2122m going through New York, I\u2122ll bring it to him. She did and I said I tried to come and see you in Washington, told her the story. She said, you \u0152 you must come and see Washington. So I hitchhiked to Washington, which if you had a straight ride to ok seven and a half hours, before everything. Before \u0152 before the bridge, be fore the parkway, be fore the tunnel in Baltimore. And I then developed the habit of h itchhiking after school on Friday to Washington and we got engaged and in the spri ng of 1950 we were married. And I could now stay under \u0152 as the family member of a U.N. employee, and work. And I got job in Washington and I\u2122ve been here ever since."

            "question": "In what ways was it significant to you that your wife was also a survivor?",
            "answer": "It was like a homecoming. I had been e ngaged to a \u0152 a \u0152 an Irish Protestant girl who was as liberal as the day is long and as bright as can be, and that, however, did not include her family. Her father was a colonel and he was the \u0152 one of the leading heart specialists in \u0152 in Ireland. And he wer \u0152 had been a colonel at [indecipherable] the African \u0152 north African campaign. He was actually in on the concentration camp reparations in Europe. And you would have thought that that might impact him in some way, and it di \u0152 it certainly impacted him, but the \u0152 the notion of his daughter marrying a foreigner, a Jew, an artist, all bad. You see, so the Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 37\u0152 the mother was also a doctor, a research. The young woman herself, her father was a professor at Queens in Belfast. She went to Trinity in Dublin, which is, of course, Catholic. And so, we did a lot of commuting between Dublin and Belfast and I got s \u0152 deeply into the Irish problem, so similar to the Israeli problem, so similar to so many of the other disc riminatory problems. And found th \u0152 intellectuals or not, there was no reasoning with the people. They believed every atrocity story. They told me the same atrocity stories north and south, with a change of characters. And \u0152 and the young people we re generally against that. But they had a tremendous uphill struggle. Anyway, the mother, the researcher doctor said do not tell Dad that you are getting engaged, because it will kill him. In defense of this absurd attitude, let me tell you that my ow n family was not lagging far behind. And my mother\u2122s eagerness to get me on that graduate year to America was without a doubt largely motivated by \u0152 she was even willing to not be near me i-in order to save me from a fate worse than death in \u0152 in her \u0152 in her view. And \u0152 and so \u0152 so what \u0152 what can I say to you? It is a \u0152 an amazing thing. I have never found out what happened to this young woman, who was certainly completely innocent of \u0152 of anything that took place. And for awhile I was in \u0152 in agony to make a decision what I would do with my life before I decided to marry my wife, whom I admire tremendously as the child survivor of her entire family. The thre e children were the only survivors, everybody else was murder ed. And so you do what you feel you Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 38must do. And I as \u0152 must say I \u0152 we\u2122ve ha d an absolutely marvelous marriage. With the millennium it\u2122ll be our golden wedding anniversary. And ma \u0152 the secret recipe is respect and admiration."

            "question": "I would like to ask you more about England after the war, and then we\u2122ll go back to the United States in a moment. Did you experi ence any other anti-Semitism in England after the war?",
            "answer": "Not really, not really. I would say we had a mixed bag of friends, some refugees, Germany and Austria and Hungary and so on. And quite a few British people. You see, I\u2122ve been several people in my life. I\u2122ve been a student, so I had art student friends. I had \u0152 some of whom beca me very famous artists. I had been a \u0152 a \u0152 a soldier, not only with other foreigners, but with British colleagues. When I was in London just now, one of my friends from cadet school, who was a fellow commander with whom I\u2122d actually done a night patrol in Normandy , without us realizing it until we told each other the stories, that we obviously were both on the same thing, in cadet school we were very close friends, and he is as English as they make them, and he came to see me up from Essex, where he now lives. And we said we\u2122ll have lunch in a pub, and a drink. And he told me that it was his 75 th birthday. And I said how c \u0152 how could you leave your family on your 75 th birthday? And he said, I told Peggy I \u0152 I w \u0152 I wanted to do this. And he said, you don\u2122t realize it, but on my 50 th birthday I happened to be visiting you in Washington. And on my 21st Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 39birthday we were both in Normandy . So I thought it appropriate. He also brought me a thing he had written about his D-Day experience. It is extremely moving. It was his father\u2122s birthday, D-Day. And when it was over, D-Day night, he said, I felt \u0152 I suddenly reflected that I was very grateful not to have spoiled my father\u2122s birthday by becoming a casualty. So, I \u0152 I \u0152 I think his D-Day account is brilliant. He writes as I wish I could, and he in turn, has read \u0152 read my book and he said to me \u0152 he wrote me a letter and he said, I\u2122v e read your book, and you\u2122re not supposed to enjoy a book about such grim times and experiences. But you and I know that in between the grim times and experiences, we had some wonderful times. So forget what I said about \u0152 I really enjoyed your book, because it\u2122s like you were there, I mean, when you read it. And so is his. And he says, you know, D-Day wasn\u2122t so bad for us compared to what we experien ced in the next few days afterwards, and that\u2122s true. But in describing his D-Day, he tells me where \u0152 you see, he was \u0152 he had a disadvantage over me. He was surrou nded by all the people with whom he had trained. I was one of me attached to people I barely knew. A training mistake, they should have put me with them earlier. But, when they were killed, I didn\u2122t know them. When his buddies were killed, and one was like shot in half crossing a road in front of him, these were his friends. So it was much more personal for him, a-and I respect that, I mean I \u0152 I never saw one of my immediate friends killed or wounded. I saw a lot of people killed or wounded, but not my immediate friends. Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 40They were attached to the unit next door, as \u0152 a specialist as I was, to this. So it \u0152 it made a-an emotional difference that was to my advantage. I mean, I was shocked enough when I heard that two chaps down the road whom I knew very well had \u0152 had just been killed, you know, and so on. I don\u2122t see them. And I was Tommy gun guard for a burial party that buried, I don\u2122 t know, 40 people. I didn\u2122t know any of them. So it \u0152 it \u0152 you know, these are all factors in this thing, it\u2122s a very, very personal the experiences."

I also was aware that many people were given immunity for \u0152 for reasons of practicality of \u0152 of [indecipherable] scientists who were needed and goodness knows what else. It did not i nvolve me personally. I now welcome the Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 41notion that \u0152 that Palestine \u0152 that \u0152 that Israel came into existence, and I have mentioned to you before my Scottish principal with whom I used to skirmish in art school, and I remember that I was in his office when the assassination of Count Bernadotte came th-through \u0152 the news came through. And I said, I\u2122m shocked about that, one should not kill United Nations officials. I-I think that\u2122s beyond the pale. And he said, to my utter amazement, these are the birth pains of a new nation, and you have to accept it, that this is the sort of thing, we don\u2122t know the details. And later of course, I heard that Bernadotte was targeted because he was assuming a stance of a very unfavorable [indecipherable] and so on and so on. But I was amazed that this Scotsman had the vision to s \u0152 way beyond mine, that this was a thing you had to take into your stride. Anti-Semitism, wh ich is coming back to early Christian, didn\u2122t affect, but you have to bear in mind that all our chaps had cover stories and many of them found the [indecipherable] of that cover story was comfortable, and so they didn't say who they were. Many of them didn\u2122t practice any religion particularly, and when it came to intermarriage, all of us were independent enough to say if I want marry an Eskimo, I will. Metaphorically speaking, quite a few married Eskimos, which some of them came to regret. But that doesn\u2122t alter the fact that on principle, you felt, I\u2122m my own person, I can do what I like. Now comes the question which is probably down your list somewhere, of \u0152 of h-how much did Judaism mean? It\u2122s very difficult. On the one hand, some of Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 42us had a reaction, saying I don\u2122t want to belong to anything that excludes somebody. That\u2122s a very broad statement, but \u0152 but i-it\u2122s meant to be. I don\u2122t want to belong to a Jewish club. That means only Jews can join, because that is the exclusion of somebody and that\u2122s what we were just fighting against. I don\u2122t want to belong to another club either, that include \u0152 excludes people. In fact, I don\u2122t want [indecipherable] . But it goes beyond that, because you say, if I send my children to Sunday school, or they belong to a club, I don\u2122t want to join any clubs. Clubs segregate. That\u2122s not always reasonable, but that\u2122s an emotional reaction to some of the things that have happened before. So you see, we did not send in our children to \u0152 to Sunday school. I had two daughters an d a son. We had the son, the son was Bar Mitzvahed . The girls were not Bat Mitzvahed because we hadn\u2122t even heard of that in Europe. The son was Bar Mitzvahed. When he was born he did not have a bris, he was circumcised in the hospital. It\u2122s again the emotional reaction against belonging to something that excludes other people. It\u2122s quite absurd if you reflect upon it, and it\u2122s taken me years to \u0152 to \u0152 to overcome it. But \u0152 but it was a very real factor, possibly an error, socially, possibly an error religiously, because parallel to that are the war memories of going to shul with my grandfather, who was very, very serious about it, as my parents were not. And the tug of war between the sentiment an \u0152 of emotional tradition on the one hand, and the not wanting to belong to anything that excludes anybody else is an ongoing thing. Ri ght now I\u2122m deeply Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 43embroiled in a fight that I find myself in, rather surprisingly. It is that the members of my troop of \u0152 of foreign refugees, want to put up a memorial to the troop and the 20 who were killed in north Wales where we were trained. This is all initiated by my book, where it suddenly has sort of come to \u0152 come alive, and a retired judge who was one of us, refugee from Germany, has taken the ball and is running with it like crazy, and the people in north Wales think that the movie will be made in \u0152 in north Wales , which of course doesn\u2122t follow. But \u0152 so the local council and the council of Wales is all in favor and has given us a lovely little green plot overlooking the ocean in this resort town, where they are going to put up a memorial. And when they drafted the words, it said, refugees from Nazi oppression. It did not use the word Jewish. And I\u2122m up in arms, and I say it has to include the word at least mostly Jewish. And in orde r to bring this about, I am fighting tooth and nail, I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m enlisting the support of my surviving colleagues or their widows. I sought an interview with the Honorable Miriam Rothschild, who was married to one of our chaps and is a wealthy ma \u0152 scientist in her 90\u2122s. And she said, you must come down and talk about it, and I just now I went to the Rothschild estate and we spent all day talking and she is solidly on my side. And the \u0152 the thing that\u2122s happening is that some of the chaps who have embraced their cover story, don\u2122t want to break that cover story. It is as if they thought that the York massacre, of which they have never heard, happened last year rather than hundreds of years Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 44ago, and that by assuming the \u0152 their identities as British citizens church of England, which is what our dog tags said, they are escaping any danger of antiSemitism and they have forgotten who they really are. Or rather, they would like to forget. Not all of them. Some of the non-Je wish members of the troop, there is a \u0152 a \u0152 a fellow, he is now in his 80s, friend of mine, who \u0152 whose name is Gizer (ph), he served under the name of Gordon . He is a grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph). Walter Liebknecht(ph) was the buddy and companion of Rosa Luxemburg, if that means anything to you, early German communism. His father, the son of Walter Liebknecht(ph) \u0152 Walter Liebknecht(ph) was assassinated by forerunners of the Nazis in the 20s. There is a K\u00e4the Kollwitz woodcut, a gorgeous woodcut of the \u0152 the body of Walter Liebknecht(ph) and mourners. She was very much involved in that, K\u00e4the Kollwitz. Well, the grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph), not Jewish, said there is not a drop of Jewish club in \u0152 blood in me, but I respect, applaud and salute my Jewish comrades and their brav ery and I am on your side that it should say mostly Jewish on the monument. Another one, Ron Gilbert Goodman, he served in undercover intelligence in Germany after his command of duty. He got an MBE, Member of the British Empire in \u0152 from \u0152 from the queen, and he said \u0152 he maintained his cover longer than anybody, because he had to. He was \u0152 he was catching Nazis, you see. Post-war Nazis. And he said \u0152 it was a bit embarrassing because he\u2122s \u0152 he\u2122s widowed, his girlfriend wanted to read the book and he thought Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 45well, that will break my cover as far as she\u2122s concerned. But wh ile he \u0152 they were discussing it, she got it from Amazon dot com and read it and \u0152 and he said, the hell with the cover, I\u2122m on your side. He remembers that he was forced to destroy his shul, by the Nazis. So you see, for the judge, it\u2122s probably very difficult to go to the Welsh council and say, on reflection, it ought to say mostly Jewish. And I don\u2122t know whether he\u2122s man enough to do it. But if he isn\u2122t, I\u2122ll withdraw my support. That\u2122s how that one is."

He didn\u2122t understand what that meant, really. Scottish highland chief, you know, head of the [indecipherable], the 17th Lord Lovett(ph). He \u0152 he doesn\u2122t understand what \u0152 wh o \u0152 who \u0152 who we are, although he subsequently apparently did. I just \u0152 in Scotland I talked to the widow of the brigade major, Lady Hopagow(ph) and she was full of \u0152 of \u0152 of \u0152 brimful of Holocaust stories and \u0152 and \u0152 and saying how \u0152 how supportive she was and so on. But, the Honorable Miriam Rothschild tells me that when she was in north Wales, first as the fianc\u00e9e of one of our people, the landlady said she did not wish her to come again, because she didn\u2122t want a Jewish person in her house. And then she said two other things happened. One was that Lord Rothschild was in MI-5 in British Intelligence, counter-Intelligence, and he told her that somebody had accused her in Wales to be probably a spy, and that they had actua lly searched her belongings. And she said, how could they? And sh \u0152 he \u0152 he actually cited exampl es of a crossword puzzle she had been working on, that MI-5 knew had \u0152 had been extracted from her room. And when she \u0152 ou-our man, of course, wa s under his cover story, the one who was engaged to her, so he coul dn\u2122t say anything in partic ular. And when they were married, they kicked him out too. So, for that reason she was against that memorial and I said to her, I\u2122m much more confrontational than you are. If there was a manifestation as you describe, of antiSemitism, the more reason to have a Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 47memorial there saying mostly Jewish, so that, you know, what\u2122s wrong with that? And she agreed with me."

And \u0152 but he respected me and I respected him in \u0152 in-in \u0152 in our stubbornness. And what he knew, I really don\u2122t know. I told you some of my fellow students became very famous. I tried to talk one of them out of his career because he wanted to be a scenic designer and I said, there\u2122s no future in that field. And he almost changed his major, but then he stayed a scenic designer. He is now one of the most famous ones in the world. He has, I think, a CBE from the queen and he is working. We couldn\u2122t meet because he was doing an amphitheater in the south of France . And he called me and we had a long chat. An d then he is going to ho \u0152 Peking , and then he is going to Hong Kong and then he is going to Kuala Lumpur and in between he is doing \ufb01 Midsummer Night\u2122s Dream\ufb02 in Copenhagen. In \u0152 he was doing \ufb01Nabucco,\ufb02 which is a Jewish Verdi opera, I mean, Jewish subject about Nebuchadnezzar and what have you, and the Jews in the south of France, in the hotbed of French neo-Nazism. And so he had, in an amphitheater, which makes it more difficult, he projected a Star of David over the amphitheater. And at first it Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 48was going to be during the famous Nabucco chorus of the \u0152 of the Jews. And then he said, in reflection, after reflection, I\u2122d like to make a political statement. So I want it from the beginning of the overtur e, through the first act, the Star of David projected onto the entire amphitheater."

He is from Berlin, Hungarian Jewish family.

            "question": "I wanted to ask you to reflect upon wh at was going on in your head and what was going on around you during the conflict over the partition of Palestine and then Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 49ultimately the declaration of independence and statehood. For you, as a Jewish refugee, what was going on in your mind in England in those days?",
            "answer": "Well, as I have really explained when I talked to you about my conversations with Mr. Johnson \u0152 I didn\u2122t mention his name either, William Johnson was the Scottish painter who was the principal of my school. He must be long dead. I \u0152 a-at first abhorred the violence, and it took me awhile to \u0152 to settle into the understanding that he had ahead of me. I \u0152 I could not at first fathom that oh, blowing up the King David hotel was a good thing to do, you see. Difficult. I \u0152 I-I respect his explanation that he gave, sayi ng the birth pangs of a nation, you see. But, at first it was very difficult to grasp that the average \u0152 I mean, you have to bear in mind, you\u2122re a British soldier and you are assigned to this. Now, I have a friend who was in the Pioneer corps with me, his name is Peter Bloch(ph). He is from Germany, a refugee, Jewish refugee. He volunteered and he got into the 21st independent parachute company, which was \u0152 had some foreigners in it, British parachute company. He found himself in Greece, fighting civilians, political civilians and he hated it. It \u0152 it ma \u0152 pushed him wa \u0152 way over left politically and then he was assigned to Palestine with the six \u0152 with the first airborne division. And he said, I don\u2122t want to go. And they said, well, what do you mean? You are a war hero, you\u2122re \u0152 he said, I \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 you can call me what you will. I may have been a war hero in your eyes, but now I\u2122m a conscientious objector. And I think he Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 50managed that, conscientious objection not to serve with the first airborne in \u0152 British first airborne in what was Palestine. And surely you can understand it. I can\u2122t understand that it threw him, but I can understand but I don\u2122t agree that it made him go way over to the left when he studied at the [indecipherable] school of economics and we used to have arguments about that. And I think he has settled down more or less as a liberal. But a \u0152 a \u0152 a \u0152 in \u0152 in his youth certainly the people he was hanging out with were \u0152 were a mi xed bag of people who were reading the \ufb01Daily Worker\ufb02 in the London underground demonstratively, and I remember hearing them complain saying I wish they\u2122d give us a new one, I\u2122m getting fed up holding this paper all the time. But it\u2122s done for demonstrative purposes, you see. The \u0152 well, the whole communism question, of course had s \u0152 got into the act in that when \u0152 when Stalin did some of the things he did, he became unacceptable, and the people who had been supportive of \u0152 of \u0152 of communism suddenly found themselves in a rather awkward position, because how do you backtrack when you\u2122ve been such an enthusiast? And suddenly you\u2122re \u0152 you\u2122re \u0152 the people you have been following are comm itting atrocities that you cannot \u0152 cannot accept. So, I \u0152 I never \u0152 I never got into that communist game as so many y oung students did. I suppose it was a question of upbringing, because afte r losing World War I, for which many Jewish Austrians were great enthusiasts, they \u0152 they suddenly found that war is hell. Meaning the depression following it, meaning defeat, meaning the Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 51peculiar post-war \u0152 post World War I dealings, politically, where Austria was completely emaciated to a six million country from being a world empire. And peculiarly Germany, which was the much younger country, something like 2,000 years of Austria compared to 90 years of Germany. Germany was intact and more powerful than ever after \u0152 well, not economically, but \u0152 but territorially. So, you hear of Germans yearning for a return to power. You ga \u0152 you do \u0152 never hear of Austrians yearning for a return to power, because they were made up of so many minorities, that wanted to be torn apart. Which you see again in what used to be Yugoslavia . Every minority wants to be independent, whether they are viable or not. First independence, then maybe we\u2122ll co nfederate. I\u2122ll believe it when I see it. Terrible."

            "question": "Is there anything else that you would like to add ab out your years in postwar England?",
            "answer": "My years in postwar England were primarily as a student. I had a \u0152 a wonderful time. I had \u0152 there was no G.I. bill, but there was a so-called further education and training grant, which was more modest than the G.I. bill, but it certainly sustained me together with my freelance activities. And I had my \u0152 my own apartment in southwest London, and I traveled mostly by bicycle, and by underground. And I had lots of friends Wartime friends, En glish friends, English friends from cadet school. I had some with whom I corresponded for years afterwards and the Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 52correspondence only ended because they died. I had a brilliant friend who wrote me sheafs of letters, all not about news, but ab out philosophical observations. I have kept them all. I \u0152 I find that \u0152 well, the Latin proverb, Ubi bene ibi patria. Where I\u2122m well, there is my country, applies to some extent. I could live in England easily, but I could live anywhere unless the system of the country were such that I could not stomach it. I have a reluctance to visit countries in my travels where there is the juxtaposition of luxurious wealth and abject poverty, which has kept me away from China, from India and many other countries. I-It is perhaps a \u0152 a \u0152 a \u0152 an ostrich policy of simply not wanting to see it, but I find it distressing. I would say it includes Mexico . I\u2122ve been to Mexico once to a Club Med and I don\u2122t think I\u2122ll go there again. I-It\u2122s not my thing. I \u0152 I don\u2122t know, I find that postwar England , I \u0152 I \u0152 I never really worked in England , other than on a farm as a boy, which did me a lot of good, and briefly on being released from internment \u0152 I did not go from internment into the army, I went from internment to being released, forgotten out momentarily, and then into the army, when I was old enough. I \u0152 I worked for a Polish publisher, and I was nothing. I mean , I was a gopher. And I have therefore, no work experience in England that could be called a work experience. The \u0152 the thing about the bacon and eggs picture tu rned me off rather solidly. Whether I would have gotten into my profession, I would imagine I would. I don\u2122t know how it would have worked. I\u2122m \u0152 I can\u2122t, I rea lly don\u2122t know. In this country there was a Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 53certain realization, that if you have any talents at all, there is someone somewhere to whom those talents are worth money, and th ey are willing to pay for it. They might be willing to pay as little as possible, but on the other hand, if you are reasonably alert and if you are willing to go where it\u2122s at \u0152 which is something that almost no other country seems to have. I mean, I can\u2122t picture people doing what people in this country have been doing for a couple of generations, that is the economic situation in our town is bad, so we put everybody in the car and drive to a state where I understand you can get a job. People ga \u0152 actually do that. They don\u2122t do it elsewhere. And most of all, I realize that in this country, if something bothers you and you are willing to spend some time trying to remedy it \u0152 it needn\u2122t be a very political thing, it can be the bumps on the street, or \u0152 or the speed limit, or whether your school needs an addition. You don\u2122t have to \u0152 to \u0152 to give up your job to \u0152 to pursue this. You work on in a little bit and th en get together with a few people who are like-minded. And in your own lifetime \u0152 even in \u0152 within the next few years, something actually starts to happen. Sometimes too fast. I come back to the bumps where they \u0152 they want the bumps in, then now they want the bumps out. And when they\u2122re out they will want them in again. You know, I mean, and \u0152 and \u0152 and that actually happens, at great expense and with a big effort. But you try and do that in some other country, and you know what\u2122s gonna happen? Nothing is gonna happen. Maybe it\u2122s changing a little, slowly now, and there are things happening here and Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 54there. But by and large, you run your head up against a wall, and the wall, the base of the wall is littered with the bleached bones of people who have tried before you, and some of them were good people, but they failed. Well, that\u2122s a big discouragement to run your head against th e wall. I have participated in some of these things in this country. Got an addition built at the elementary school where my children went, which actually came into use while the youngest one was still there. You know, I mean, unheard of in \u0152 in \u0152 in other countries. Doesn\u2122t \u0152 doesn\u2122t happen, doesn\u2122t happen. So I find it enormo usly refreshing, and you can take some of the other things in your stride a little bit if you know that on the other hand, this exists."

            "question": "Let\u2122s go back to the 1950s and now you are living in the United States. I would like to get a sense of what was happening in your life, now you\u2122re newly married and you are now in the Washington, D.C. area. What was happening to you professionally and pers onally in the 1950s?",
            "answer": "I first g \u0152 my \u0152 my wife arranged th at I should see a man who was himself a n \u0152 a German refugee, and he re \u0152 had a small public relations agency, that was a new profession. And he would steer me to where I might get a job as a graphic designer. Well, I went to see him, and he decided to employ me. In some \u0152 in many respects that was a disaster. It was a very small firm, of more heads than employees. And the attitude was rather peculiar. I was now the art director and the art department all in Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 55one, and we didn\u2122t have many jobs to do. Through family connections he got an assignment where I \u0152 where there were to be free full page, full color ads in \ufb01Esquire\ufb02 magazine. I had never do ne anything like it, and neither had anybody else there. So it was my assignment. I not only designed th em, I wrote them, I supervised the photography, I went into unbelievable acrobatics. And they came out, for those times, pretty well. One of the partners suggested that I be given a bonus, because I think I earned 30 dollars a week. The big boss said, he is an artist and he had the fun of doing it, it\u2122s a bad idea to give him a bonus. And they didn\u2122t. This kind of attitude made it a little difficult. I-It was in everything. I mean, if we did get money for this, there\u2122s no doubt we did, he would buy a new oriental rug for the office. And I designed a shiny brass nameplate for downstairs on [indecipherable] street where we were \u0152 had a \u0152 had a upstairs office with a three-dimensional logo which I had designed in the \u0152 custom made in brass. I mean, we were really going for it, and everybody ha d their own hand-engraved business card, and \u0152 which we really couldn\u2122 t afford, you know? And \u0152 and the \u0152 well, we went to a meeting for \u0152 with \u0152 with some corporate association, and I discovered the thing I mentioned elsewhere in \u0152 in other connec tions, and that is that nobody was saying anything, and we were to sell these people on why we wanted to do this. So I spoke up and I said, here\u2122s what we need to do. We actually did a broc hure for them. That was unprecedented, and \u0152 and i-it wouldn\u2122t have happened if I hadn\u2122t sold them on Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 56the concept, because it was way out modern for them at that time, you know. Well, ultimately everybody quit, and I was the sole employee. The boss took a job with the government and said, don\u2122t ever call me there unless there\u2122s an utter emergency. And then he said, I see here an advertisement that the Pentagon is \u0152 wants to retain an agent, an advertising agency for the army. So why don\u2122t you go and bid on that. Me. And I said, you know, tha-that\u2122s a bit absurd, because they are looking for a big corporation to handle this. Never mind, you do as you\u2122re told. I went to the Pentagon and to this room full of col onels and what have you and advertising agencies from all over the country. And the colonel who made the opening speech said any firm whose business would be do ubled by this account is disqualified. Obviously it didn\u2122t want small time people. I knew my boss so I stayed til the end of the talk and I came back and I said, we are disqualified because of this stipulation. And he said why? And I said, because if your business is doubled. He said, well, it would do much more than double our business, so we are all right. And he was absolutely ser-serious, you see. So I \u0152 I \u0152 he filled out the forms, I filled out the forms and he sent them in. I was still the only employee. After awhile there was \u0152 the door rang one day \u0152 door bell rang and it was a team to evaluate our facilities. That was rather difficult for me, but I ha d been trained to improvise, and I said several people are on assignment with [indecipherable] and several people are on vacation, and right at this moment I am th e only person here just for this next hour Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 57or so. Would you rather come back anothe r time, or what? And they said, perhaps we should. And there were lots of empty de sks and the place was very elegant, with the oriental rug and all the other stuff. And they left, and I called the boss at work in government. I told you never to call me. I said, well, I think this is an emergency. These guys might come back any time, I \u0152 they \u0152 they don\u2122t \u0152 I tried to pin them down, but they said they come for ra ndom inspection. And he said, I\u2122m coming over. And he came and he said, you know, in \u0152 we \u0152 we have to do something. And he said, I just crossed Lafayette Park. We could take some of the bums from the benches, and some of them are your si ze and some of them are mine, and could dress them up and sh \u0152 have them \u0152 give them a shave and they could be sitting at the desks when these pe \u0152 if \u0152 if only we knew when they are coming again. I \u0152 I said, you know, I \u0152 I don\u2122t think that that\u2122ll work. He was deadly serious. Well, a short while later, he had the account of an African nation, and who was doing it? I. We had a newsletter. I had absolutely no ma terial for the newsletter, but I went to the ambassador and interviewed him, and I we nt to look at the postage stamps of the country, and there \u0152 there were some animals that were indigenous only to that country, so I went to the zoo and talked to the director about whether he had any of these specimen, and he did, and I had a phot ographer and I took pictures in the zoo, and pictures of the stamps and I got a co ngratulatory letter from a philatelist at the Smithsonian saying I wish more people were doing this. He didn\u2122t know I was Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 58doing it out of desperation, you see. And then the boss was invited for the inauguration of the president in that country, and he went, and was decorated. And I said, be sure to keep me informed so I can write the newsletter that should get to the guests before they go \u0152 all go home. And he said he would, and he sent me nothing. And I was getting progressively more desperate because I felt duty-bound to do this and I called his wife. And I said, is he writing to you? And she said yes. I said, can I see the letters? She said no, they are rather private. I said, cross out the private things and \u0152 and I \u0152 I have to have something of what\u2122s going on. Didn't get anything. I finally took \u0152 fished out account s of the first inauguration. This was a re-inauguration of a second term presiden t, and I wrote as if somebody had been there, and if it described the \u0152 the women\u2122s dresses in general terms, I described the women\u2122s dresses in general terms. And I \u0152 I \u0152 I just winged the whole thing and \u0152 and showed pictures of the previous inauguration. And I had it all just about done, with each story on one desk and now all I had to do is assemble it, and he came back and he said, the place is in an awful mess. And I said mess? The mess is each desk, since nobody sits at the desks, it\u2122s one story. It\u2122s perfectly organized, I \u0152 it\u2122s the only way I can get this thing out in time. And he said, first we\u2122re going to get the place shipshape. I said, you touch one of these stories, I \u0152 I\u2122m out of here. He touched the stories, and I quit. And then he wanted to pay me to come back to put out the issue, and so I \u0152 but I mean, for the swan song, but I wa \u0152 you know, there Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 59was simply no way. So I called all the peop le who had quit before, half a dozen and one of them was working for channel nine television. And he said, how would you like to be a television art director? I said, well there\u2122s one catch, I know nothing about television. He said, neither does anybody else, it\u2122s new. Why don\u2122t you come on out, I can\u2122t promise anything, but we\u2122ll see. I went out and I was television art director, and it was lots of fun. Pioneers, you know. Never before. Live television. We did fantastic things. We had more cour age than good sense. We \u0152 we \u0152 we did spectacular things, we got \u0152 and being Washington we did network things, and I-I did presidential broadcasts for several presidents, some at the White House, some in the studio. I \u0152 then \u0152 then CBS did a survey and discover ed that the country was read for country music. I think the survey meant Simon and Garfunkel , but they didn\u2122t understand that, and so we got Jimmy Dean. And we did the Jimmy Dean show, network, and I had a ball. I had a fre e hand to do what I like. I did a network musical every week. It meant not sleepi ng for one night, working clean acro \u0152 around the clock. And for couple of adjacen t night, if we got home by two or three in the morning, we were doing well. And I decided I had to make a move financially, so I went to the management, wh ich was as autocratic as they come, and I said, you are not charging enough for my services. That was the approach. And they said, how much should we be charging? I said, well first of all, I\u2122d like to have a percentage, like all the other talent is ge tting. Oh really, how much do you have in Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 60mind? So I \u0152 my wife and I had a long se ssion over the weekend, because if I said the right amount, they would cut it in half. If I said too much they would laugh and fire me. If I said not enough, they would accept it. So I had to say too much, but just enough too much that by cutting it back it would be reasonable. And that actually worked. And it was based on th e premise that the role of Washington television would increase. I was much more optimistic than they were, and I was right. The trouble was when I didn\u2122t get any sleep any more, I couldn\u2122t \u0152 didn\u2122t have time to bill, so that my bills were accumulations of several weeks. And that meant the check was large, and that meant the pers on who had to sign the check was signing a check that was bigger than his. It wasn\u2122t really bigger than his, but it was by the fact that it was several weeks. And that irked them. So after a period of time, they said, we are going to terminate this agreement. And I said, and what? And they said, we\u2122ll \u0152 we\u2122ll see that you are all right. Well, seeing that was \u0152 I was all right was a ludicrous joke compared to what I\u2122d been earning. So I said, I don\u2122t know whether that is acceptable. So they said, do you want to see the president, whom we could never see. I met him in the elevator and usually told him what \u0152 what \u0152 what I \u0152 what I needed and he would support me, because I was an asset. This time they were waiting. You want to see the president? Sure. I walked in and he was \u0152 you know, it was the days of having no desk and a long settee and he was sitting on the armrest with his feet up on the settee and said, sit down. I was sitting 12 foot away Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 61on the long settee. And he said, can we help you to relocate? And I said, I \u0152 I think I\u2122ll manage. And in the meantime they offered my assistant, who was AfroAmerican, my job at half the salary. And he quit and we formed a partnership, and we freelanced for \u0152 after 10 years, for channel nine, really doing, if I say so myself, an excellent bloody job. We were way ahead of people, right to the right and left. Some of them even called us and said, you are giving us a hard time, you are doing such fascinating things that our management is constantly on us. We freelanced for another five years, as you know, a design partnership. Now, we did work for the other networks. We did the [indecipherable] orbital launch for ABC, we did the inaugural coverage for ABC. We are \u0152 we had been CBS. They had \u0152 they deliberately prevented us from doing freelance for a few years, out of sheer malice. Ultimately we got into a difficult situation because my partner \u0152 we were doing a \u0152 a fashion show at the Mayflower with Lyndon Johnson\u2122s daughters. And we were building a \u0152 a \u0152 a walkway and sets and this was in Herndon, Virginia and I\u2122d worked there all day and I was getting very tired, and I said, can you come out and finish up, and he said sure. And as he walked into the shop where we were building things, a guy hit a knot on a four by four [indecipherable] his lathe, and a piece flew off like a shell and hit him \u0152 hit my partner over the head and he had a fractured skull. And he didn't want to be hospitalized in Virginia in those days. So he got on the phone and arranged for his ambulance and hospitalization in the Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 62district where his sister was a nurse for a neurosurgeon. And he said, I \u0152 I have a fractured skull, can you come and get me? It\u2122s near Dulles airport, th-they took an hour before he was in that hospital. And they put in a metal plate and \u0152 and I found him a lawyer, and he got enough insurance compensation to buy a couple houses on Capitol Hill. And talking about anti-Semitism, or anti-black or anti anything, my art director colleagues in Washington would sometimes take me aside and say, we respect what a courageous thing you are doing. And I said, what am I doing? And they said, you have a black partner. And I said, it\u2122s not because I\u2122m courageous, we work well together. And they would say ye s, but it can\u2122t be easy. I say, it\u2122s no problem at all, we have \u0152 we have always worked together where we could work on one piece of rush work where I start on the right and he starts on the left and we meet in the middle and it looks like one piec e. What more could you want? See? So that was still even in the creative arts a \u0152 a \u0152 a fact that people respected me for doing this. And reversely, I advertised for an assistant and one of my friends and colleagues called up and said, we lost one big account, so we have to lay off a couple of designers. We highly recommend so and so. He is Jewish, but he\u2122s a very nice guy. But he is a very nice guy. I hired him, but that still went on, you see, and that\u2122s in the liberal arts. So maybe that\u2122s why my friends in England want to duck out from the words on the monument. Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 63"

And I did [indecipherable] I did some at the White House with President Eisenhower , subsequently with President Kennedy. We did a great big show at the \u0152 at the Sheraton Park Hotel, which was called, Dinner with the President, seven cameras, prime time, with Kennedy in attendance and Johnson in attendance, and a cast of stars. Josh White, Hanya Holm ballet, the CBS symphony orchestra. Robert Preston was the MC, the movie actor who did, you know, \ufb0176 Trombones,\ufb02 etcetera. And Josh \u0152 I said Josh White , the folk singer. The Clancy brothers. These were big names at the time, and Judy Collins and \u0152 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 65and I did a lot of id \u0152 scenery and had to build a stage because they didn\u2122t have one. And had to build dressing rooms down stairs. And that was quite \u0152 quite an exciting project, I enjoyed it thor oughly. I remember President Kennedy sitting there at the table facing the stage when his alarm went off. His \u0152 his wristwatch alarm to tell him that he had to \u0152 only so much more time to \u0152 to stay. And he made some joke about it, he was very qu ick with things like that. He was very funny. Very, very nice event, very warm hearted. I remember they had written things especially for him. There\u2122s an old American song called, \ufb01We Want No Irish Here,\ufb02 which was, you know, prejudice ag ainst the Irish immigrants. And they sang that facetiously, and lots of f un. Well done, great success. So I \u0152 I af \u0152 you want to know what happened afterwar ds in \u0152 after my television years, I freelanced for the other networks. I did the six orbital flight for ABC. There was some scenery and some background material. I did inauguration of Kennedy for ABC, when it snowed so hard, we had great problems because it was almost impossible to get to the capital. On the way the truck broke do wn, and we had to get this show on the air. So we \u0152 we had a little pickup truck with \u0152 with \u0152 to \u0152 to build the booth at the stand facing the inauguration platform. And we called the American Automobile Association to help us, and they sa id, we can\u2122t help anyone who is not blocking traffic on the \u0152 on the parade route \u0152 on the route. So we said, thank you very much. And there were three of us in that pickup truck, my Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 66construction man and his assistant and I. An d we pushed the truck to where it was blocking traffic in the inauguration rout e because we \u0152 we obviously had to get there. And without making another phone call, a roving AAA service truck got us started and we \u0152 in \u0152 in the snow, and we made it to the capital. The next near disaster was that the moisture of the snow that was melting on top of the flimsily constructed booth was leaking into the boo th and short circuiting the cameras. And \u0152 and w \u0152 I mean, we an \u0152 we knew we wo uld short circuit the cameras. Well, I \u0152 when you\u2122re a television art director, one thing you know how to do is where to get help quickly and who is reliable to co me through and so on. I mean it \u0152 this was in the days of live television, i-it might be the sort of thing where somebody wanted to have a sailboat in the studio in the two hours a nd you would find one and get one into the studio in two hours. I once had a ta xi pick up a chestnut man, you know, who \u0152 in the street, with his little oven, roasting \u0152 there was only one in Washington , in New York they used to be on every corner in the winter. And I knew where he was and we needed him for a live show, and I had a taxi pull up next to him and offer him, I think 10 bucks if he came . And h-he did, and they loaded his whole paraphernalia, the hot st ove and we had him in the studio, you know. That\u2122s how we used to do things . Well, I knew a \u0152 a construction \u0152 a \u0152 a roofing person in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in Virginia, and I got him out in the snow to get \u0152 fight his way through to the capital to lay that stuff on top of the booth to keep the Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 67water out. And in those days we were not pooled but this \u0152 we \u0152 I was doing ABC, and the people I had \u0152 used to work with was ceeb \u0152 from CBS were next door in the next booth. And I went over to a man with whom I\u2122d had many skirmishes because I felt that the \u0152 the \u0152 what shall I say, the \u0152 the good of the country preceded our little professional skirmishes. And I said to him, Bill, your cameras are going to short out. And he said, oh my God, I\u2122m sure you\u2122re right. What can I do? And I said, I have an \u0152 I happen to have a roofing guy come who is laying insulation on top of my booth, I\u2122ll have him lay some on top of your booth if you\u2122re willing to pay him for what he is doing. He\u2122s \u0152 he won\u2122t charge you much. And he was so grateful, you know, and I\u2122m sure that that kept him \u0152 kept CBS on the air for the coverage of the Kennedy inauguration. When it was over somebody stole all the furniture, even though to get to the booth, you had to get up a ladder. You know, it was a \u0152 a rather improvi sed arrangement, a \u0152 a plywood nailed together to make a platform and so on. And somehow they managed to unload that furniture during the night following the inauguration. And wasn\u2122t much furniture, but it was a desk and whatever, you know, for the newscasters a chair and a rug, and it was gone. Those were the exciting days of live television, I don\u2122t think it quite goes on that way now. Was really w onderful. After that I did some shows for the United States Information Agency, ITV, and my assistant \u0152 my \u0152 my partner and I did a number of shows for them which were seen all over the world, they had Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 68an English learning thing that we-went in ternational and was probably seen by more people than any television show ever se \u0152 as a series. And we tried to give them \u0152 whe-when we came they looked ra ther amateurish and \u0152 and we were retained to do a \u0152 a f \u0152 a couple of seasons, I believe, of thei \u0152 all their shows, internationally seen. And we tried to make them look like network television, and I think we did. Politically \u0152 when I say politically, I mean professional politically, it was rough going. Very, very difficult to deal, because \u0152 to deal with these people, because television and \u0152 and \u0152 and governmen t don\u2122t mix easily. The bureaucracy is too \u0152 too slow, too comp lex, and too \u0152 frequently too f \u0152 too unreasonable to do things that \u0152 that need simple and quick solutions and \u0152 and wwe \u0152 we managed it as best we could, bu t it was not altogether a happy \u0152 a happy situation. They would say, for instance, we have \u0152 we need to hire additional help, and we haven\u2122t got the go vernment slots, so why don\u2122t you hire them under contract? And that\u2122s not altogether prope r, but again, it \u0152 abso lutely necessary at times, you \u0152 you \u0152 you can\u2122t get \u0152 if you ca n\u2122t get the work done, you can\u2122t get on the air, and if you \u0152 a deadline is a deadline and so forth. And s \u0152 then you have to make, as an outsider, decisions whether you wa nt to do this if \u0152 if it \u0152 if you can see its urgency. And then, very frequently , you don\u2122t get the backup it requires to continue doing it. Like they would say, we have a pers on we \u0152 whom we want you to hire and you hire that person and recognize that this is a big mistake, but you\u2122re Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 69stuck in an in-between situation. I-It\u2122s not \u0152 it\u2122s not altogether a \u0152 you \u0152 you really have to walk a tightrope of \u0152 of constant difficult professional ethical decisions how you handle this, recognizing that the need on the one hand, downright patriotic need in \u0152 in the case of \u0152 I mean, they \u0152 they say they \u2122re not \u0152 they\u2122re not a ministry of propaganda and I \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122ll acce pt that, but naturally they are trying to tell the world about what America is doing, and to give people news that would otherwise not have an unbiased news re port of any international event. So, the responsibility weighs heavily on you, a nd you try and do the best you can, and while you are doing it, you are being hamper ed by all kinds of nonsense. So that, as I say, is not altogether easy. After a period of time, I had \u0152 when was it? Yes, I worked f \u0152 I was then asked by the office of economic opportunity to work on the war on poverty, President\u2122s Johnson\u2122s war on poverty. And I became its first art director. Now, for \u0152 for Sargent Shriver, President Kennedy\u2122s brother-in-law, and we have been friends ever since. And that was a-again, a very fascinating experience, because pa \u0152 the war on poverty was a \u0152 a thing that if you were involved in it, you were enthused to the point of \u0152 of personal dedication. I see images of that time where 20 or more people \u0152 20 of us would get a mailing ready, and it didn\u2122t matter what rank you were, th ere were the top officials and \u0152 and the bottom officials in tennis shoes, running around tables, stuffing envelopes to get the thing out that had to be out the next day. And from my point of view, I Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 70designed the image of the whole thing, the \u0152 the \u0152 the logos, the emblems, the visual impact which was necessary because we had to do everything we could to muster the enthusiasm of a \u0152 a \u0152 a nation that was not always enthusiastic about the specific things we were trying to do. If you tried to open a job corps camp somewhere where you were training underprivileged youngsters, these were teenagers and \u0152 and people were afraid of them. They were racial \u0152 there were racist prejudices, where they said we don\u2122 t want that next to our town, you know, and th-the \u0152 the kind of thing we had to try and overcome. I remember incidents where in some job corps camp young men stole a car and drove it into a station wagon with a family and several members of that family were killed. And the next day there was an outcry and the persec \u0152 across the country saying this program is no good. Well, it \u0152 nothing to do with the quality of the program and he would have stolen the car if he had not been in the job corps presumably, and no reason to assume otherwise. Bu \u0152 and to \u0152 to \u0152 to then crucify the program because ssomebody had deviated what was the kind of thing that we were at times up against. There were a \u0152 a story possibly apic \u0152 apocryphal that went around, that the mayor of a town who didn\u2122t want to have a job corps camp next to him said, these are going to be the \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 I \u0152 I have se \u0152 now the camp had already opened and he was trying to get it closed down. And the mayor said, th-the \u0152 it \u0152 it\u2122s predominantly blacks in this program, and the official from the war on poverty Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 71office of economic opportunity said, as a matter of fact, it\u2122s 50 percent white. It \u0152 it\u2122s no \u0152 as a matter of fact, it\u2122s only 50 percent black. And the mayor responded, well, you see, if it were 50 percent white, that would make it all right. Which, as I say, possibly apocryphally illustrates y \u0152 the absurdity of the prejudice. The \u0152 then there was this \u0152 a s \u0152 a sudden solution for some of our problems because some brilliant mind, probably Sargent Shriver invented Head Start. Head Start being a preschool program when children are perceived to be cute and \u0152 and little, and not a threat. And yet, in and of itself a most useful thing because the learning process should start pre school, as I think we have all come to realize. And that was started with a tea at the White House. It was inaugurated and announced, and \u0152 and I designed its \u0152 its \u0152 its logo and so on of a couple of building blocks, symbolically. Lady Bird Johnson officiated at this opening, of which I had like two days notice, and it\u2122s still in existence now. And I just had a letter from Sarge Shriver about it, because I wrote a short article about how we \u0152 we \u0152 the obstacle course of getting that logo in to the White House tea in \u0152 with \u0152 with no advance notice. And it was not without problems, because one of the things the legislation had said was, the maximum feasible participation of the poor. And it was not easy to get \u0152 to recruit poor people who unde rstood the state of the art methodology of dealing with pre-school children, because many of them had themselves been treated very casually, or neglected in their own preschool period or \u0152 and later. Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 72And to then put them into a responsible positions to do it in such a way as not to damage the preschool children was \u0152 was not \u0152 well, it was quite a problem. Still, much good was done over a difficult course. I worked for them for \u0152 for 10 years. It started in a real f \u0152 peculiar way. I mean, they had asked me to \u0152 to help, and I came as a volunteer, and then they wanted more help, and more help. And I said, listen, you guys, I can\u2122t spend all my time he re, I have to make a living. And they said, do you want to do it as an outside person, or as a staff person? Well, having had the experience with USA television, where as an outside person I found it terribly hard, I said staff. And they said, well, what would it take to hire you? And I s \u0152 mind you, I had really believed wh en I was first asked to do pro bono contributions that a-all the people working for this program were volunteers and it turned out that all of them were staff and I was a volunteer. So I became a staff person. And I remember in the beginning of my being a staff person, which meant somebody gave me a desk and a telepho ne, you know, and ev erything else was improvisation in the beginning, there was a writer who shared my office, as did indeed, five writers. But this particular one told me of his hardship that he was doing this as volunteer work and he hope d to get a job eventually, and that his children were hungry and nei ghbors were looking after them and so forth. And I said, you have to \u0152 you know, they are a ll so busy with what they are doing, they are not thinking of you and me. And I had to go and say, look, fish or cut bait. Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 73Either you \u0152 or I can\u2122t come as much as you want me to come and work. And then they gave me a job. And he said, darn it, I\u2122m gonna do it. And he walked down to personnel and never came back . He had told them to hire him more or not and they said not. So e-e \u0152 these were rough days. I mean, you never knew what was going to \u0152 what was going to happen next. And \u0152 and we moved from place to place into improvised offices. And at the \u0152 at the times Shriver had two jobs, Peace Corps and poverty program and so on. But we did an enormous amount of good, I am quite convinced that some of the \u0152 the enthusiasm that was mustered, of you \u0152 you\u2122ve never seen government offices like that where people are really \u0152 I mean, they would work into the night and through the night for nothing, to get things out, get things done. It was a marvelous experience. Of course, there came the time 10 years later when the administration changed and the new one decided that there was no more poverty in the United States, along with many other myth, you know, I mean the \u0152 the perception that poverty is priv \u0152 predominantly Afro-American is quite false. It is by no means that. It is, percentage-wise there are poor \u0152 poor whites in \u0152 in \u0152 in Appalachia and \u0152 and not only in Appalachia . Because of the migration to the cities to find jobs for the \u0152 from \u0152 from the rural communities, and then the disillusionment when there aren\u2122t enough jobs, and living in city slums and so on, this is a s yndrome that is true across the country. It is probably better now than it has been, wh ich doesn\u2122t mean its \u0152 it \u0152 it \u0152 it\u2122s good. Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 74But the awareness was, I think initiated \u0152 well, I don\u2122t want \u0152 I \u0152 I wanted to say by \u0152 by this program and \u0152 and it\u2122s not quite true, because of course, Roosevelt before has done \u0152 had done tremendous work. But that had begun to perhaps dissipate a bit, until it was revived by \u0152 by Johnson, who \u0152 who knew what it was like to be poor."

            "question": "Can I ask you to give me a time frame? When \u0152 what years \u0152",
            "answer": "Yeah, well, let\u2122s see, time frame. I worked for the Office of Economic Opportunity from October \u212264 to August \u212274, 10 years r oughly. And then when \u0152 when there was supposedly no more povert y, we were dispersed and I was sent to the General Services Administration, which many perceived to be a fate worse than death. But by that time, having be en in government for 10 years, I had inevitably become involved in some other battles, which is to make the government look better, which I think is te rribly important. The government \u0152 you know, we \u0152 we tend to be cynical about what the government does, and the government does some things extremely we ll. Extremely well. And hides its \u0152 its light under a bushel, where \u0152 where you don\u2122t \u0152 you don\u2122t see what \u0152 how well they are doing certain things. I was al \u0152 I-I\u2122m not saying this is true of \u0152 of every aspect, but it\u2122s true of many of their f unctions. I remember when a \u0152 a thing was introduced in the general service administration, wher e \u0152 to help citizens with questions about government, which if you\u2122ve ever tried it by yourself, can be very, Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 75very difficult. You call up and they say that \u2122s not in my job description, or the \u0152 you \u0152 you \u0152 it\u2122s not \u0152 doesn\u2122t belong here and it belongs over there and then you \u0152 you have a sheet of paper in front of y ou full of telephone num bers going down as you\u2122re being referred from one place to the other. Well, we in the General Service Administration at that time set out to \u0152 to \u0152 to end this kind of irritating obstacle course. And we had a \u0152 an \u0152 an office sp ecializing in giving you the right answer and steering you the right way. And I was skeptical that this would work. So I called them up. They couldn\u2122t tell that I was calling from the same building, you know, and I asked \u0152 I \u0152 I got a young Afro-American woman on the phone, and I asked her a question which I knew she c ould not possibly know the answer, it was a complex question that required some re search. And sh \u0152 she said, I\u2122m sorry, I can\u2122t answer this right away. I will call you in half an hour with the answer. And I said, thank you very much, and I so \u0152 sa id to myself, yeah sure. In about 27 minutes she called me up with the right answer. Now, I was absolutely bowled over, because it \u0152 believe me, it was a diffi cult, tough question that she had to research and she did it with no complaints, no fuss. I was very impressed. Tha \u0152 tha \u0152 I hesitate to say that I believe the program no longer exists, and I wonder how easy it is now to get information. But it was a move in the right direction. When I say I\u2122m not sure it exists, I learned another big lesson i-i-in \u0152 in \u0152 in government, and that is, I thought, when we had real progress, like by the poverty Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 76program, visible progress, or with an invention such as this answering of citizen\u2122s problems, you know, that there was no goi ng back, that you could not \u0152 that no future administration would be foolish enough to go back to where, you know, it would continue to move forward. That\u2122s no t true. They are not only going back at \u0152 to the \u0152 to the \u0152 to square one, they go to 50 years be fore square one, and there\u2122s some common syndromes that I came to observe. For instance, a person fro \u0152 appointed politically, either party, doesn\u2122t make any difference, to some office and heads maybe a department, maybe a divisi on. Even smaller sub-units. You get the impression that the first thing they want to do is to write a letter home to mom to say I\u2122m not at the feet of the president, I have his ear. And whether they want to invent a new identity for this particular department, division, whatever, regardless that it\u2122s part of a bigger thing, the govern ment, or if you want to go one step down, of \u0152 of \u0152 of one of the agencies of th e government, it doesn\u2122t matter, they want their own identity. So they \u0152 for \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m speaking as a visual person. So all of a sudden you have all these things spring up , and their taste generally runs to the 19th century, and not the 20th because they haven\u2122t heard of what things look like in the 20th century. But I\u2122m \u0152 when I\u2122m speaking visually, believe me that\u2122s symbolic of everything else, they \u0152 they tend to hark back to something they ha \u0152 heard of how things are, where, and they want to imitate, and since they are not necessarily chosen for being innovators, th ey tend to retard the pro \u0152 the progress Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 77and go back to, before it was when it was already outmoded. Well, that\u2122s how it is. So one has to be constantly alert, to keep things going forward. And people get really doing that at times. So \u0152 and I\u2122m not even mentioning politics, I\u2122m mentioning simply the bureaucratic proce ss, which is unavoidable to \u0152 s-so it would seem, because innovators who are capable of not that common a specimen. Well, after many a fight, some of which I\u2122ve won, I di \u0152 for instance, I designed the building signs in the federal triangle that you still see where the newscasters stand in front of the thing that says Department of Justice, or U.S. Department of Agriculture, whatever. They are these vertical standing brownish colored things with very clear lettering, with a little bulge forward so you can read the title. And they are made of reinforced fiberglass. And I had to get those accepted by the fine arts commission. They were supposedly su pposed to be a pilot program for all of Washington and then the whole country. The federal triangle being the experimental area. When I \u0152 when I presented it to the fine arts commission, they said, how long are these signs good for? An d I said \u0152 I was about to say, oh, state of the art, they last long time, when Carter Brown, who was the chairman of the fine arts commission anticipated that and said, what we are afraid of is that they will last too long, because after 10 years our tastes will have changed and we\u2122ll get tired of looking at them, and they won\u2122t give us any money to do new ones if they\u2122re still good. So I said, they will last exac tly 10 years. And two things Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 78happened. One, they are still there after, I think, what is it? 25 years. And they are getting shabby, and still they are not replacing them. And secondly, it never happened that they were \u0152 that they were done all over th-the \u0152 the town, or all over the country. A few were done by the initiative of some agencies here and there, but never beyond that. I-It just \u0152 not because they didn\u2122t like them, not because they weren\u2122t good, they just didn\u2122t get around to it, to it \u0152 it doesn\u2122t follow if something is efficient and works that this plan \u0152 that this plan will be permitted."

This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape three, side B, and you were telling me about your professional career and I believe you left me around 1974.",
            "answer": "Yes. The \u0152 when \u0152 \u212274 \u0152 I\u2122d gone slightly beyond that \u0152 was when the Office of Economic Opportunity ceased to exis t and I was transferred to the General Service Administration and I had said that I had, by now, become a fighter for making the government look better to the s \u0152 to the citizen. And to try and introduce some, at least semblance of the 20th century while it lasted, to the general population. Whereas everything te nded to be done backwards, visually, I mean, a government department. When I did the signs in the federal triangle, I had Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 79to find a sign that would be compatible with the earlier tendency to make a government office look like a Greek temple, because why? A Greek temple is \u0152 is old and solid, and the government, like banks, built like Greek temples, as we used to do, were deemed to be more solid if they looked lik e a Greek temple. Well then came the \u0152 the craving for modernity, and we got the kind of new deal architecture of an empty \u0152 beginnings of the influences of Bauhaus in \u0152 in \u0152 in style. And that in turn led to a degree of Bauhaus fatigue. That you didn\u2122t want plain boxes that were functional. The idea of \u0152 of the Bauhaus being that if it\u2122s functional and \u0152 and \u0152 and simple, and i-i \u0152 and efficient, it is beautiful, and it does not require decoration. And I was brought up with that in art school, that simple, if it\u2122s functional, it\u2122s beautiful, okay? Now look what\u2122s happened since. We \u0152 because of the \u0152 what I call the Bauhaus fatigue, we started with arbitrary and often ugly decora \u0152 over decoration. We had put flying buttresses ont o buildings as a sort of harking back to when we were building thi \u0152 Greek temples. And in post-modern you see arbitrary archways that lead nowhere, attached to buildings as \u0152 as decoration. And \u0152 a-and th-the answer, if any \u0152 no \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122m not suggesting there is an answer, the answer is that no matter what we have, the only constant thing is \u0152 is change. We are going to go to something else, because you want something else, and it doesn\u2122t mean th at it is necessarily better than its predecessor. That would be nice, and \u0152 but again, like I was saying about \u0152 a- Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 80about progress in government, I \u0152 you mustn\u2122t accept the notion that because the ultimate has been achieved, that it will therefore stay in \u0152 in \u0152 even in its \u0152 in its degree of quality. This is true in the arts. It \u0152 one could make one heck of an argument of saying that beyond Beethoven, you know, maybe we should have stopped there. Well, that\u2122s not fair, becaus e look at some of the great things that have come to us since then. Whether they are better than the classic, the role models, is \u0152 is arguable. Another thing is that \u0152 that today\u2122s art modern is tomorrow\u2122s classic. We had been talking before about the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and some of us were shocked when they came on the scene. And some of us now look upon these manifestations as classical, compared to hard rock, compared to where we are now. We are nostalgic for the Beatles and for Elvis Presley . You see? And it\u2122s amazing how you can apply this formula to all kinds of completely different things, as I have just done, and I can go beyond that, it is in \u0152 in the ci \u0152 Civil Rights Movement, which I embraced w ith great enthusiasm, having just been through six years of war to f \u0152 to fight against racism. And I would have arguments with people on all sides. I\u2122d have arguments with some of my AfroAmerican friends who would say ha \u0152 I had an Afro-American partner with whom I had va \u0152 hardly any arguments, we were on the same wavelengths. But with some of them who said that the persecution of Afro-Americans was as bad as the Holocaust, and I would say th ho \u0152 ho \u0152 hold it, hold it right there. Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 81[indecipherable] I will agree with one thing, that if \u0152 if you are running away from a lynch mob, it probably doesn\u2122t make any difference whether you\u2122re running from the Holocaust or from the lynch mob. But, apart from that, the notion that there is a federal program for your extermination and murder is different than even the collusion and perm issiveness of a government that allows lynch mobs. That \u0152 this is not an advocac y of lynch mobs, obviously, but \u0152 but the point is, the idea that it was legislated to murder everybody. Men, women, children, old people, whatever, is unique. And therefore, the comparison does not hold, okay? I remember that when I was in t \u0152 in television, and my Afro-American assistant, who later became my partner when we both quit, wa \u0152 there was one sort of greasy spoon restaurant owned by a Greek man on the corner. The only place you could eat outside, before we had a cafeteria. Well, sometimes somebody would say, let\u2122 s talk about next week \u2122s show over lunch at Frank\u2122s , that restaurant. And that meant that I woul d have to go, and my assistant could not go because of being Afro-American, they didn\u2122t serve black people in the restaurant. Which was embarrassing for me. I could either say let\u2122s not eat, which I wasn't always e-empowered to say, de pending on who wanted to eat where and when. Mind you, they would sell my partner Joe sandwiches to take out. There was a s \u0152 back counter, and he would sometim es have to do that, because he \u0152 he \u0152 he \u0152 well, I don\u2122t know, he didn\u2122t have tim e to have a sandwich prepared at home Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 82\u0152 have to eat. And we worked around the clock often, you know, so I mean \u0152 came the Civil Rights Act in the 60s and I said, Joe, are you gonna eat at Frank\u2122s? And he said, I been thinking about that. And I said, well, I can see both sides of the argument. Why should you take your custom to a place that wouldn\u2122t serve you? In fact, the waitress, when the Civil Right s Act was passed, told me at the meeting that they \u0152 I think I\u2122m going to quit because we are going to have to serve niggers. And I made some remark saying, well I think it\u2122s time that that act was passed, you know. Well, Joe said, on the other hand, if I don\u2122t go in to eat at Joe\u2122s, what was the point of getting the Civil Rights Act? So he said, I think I will. On the other hand, he said, I will fully understand if some of my race do not go in to eat in restaurants that were segregated until yesterday, because \u0152 and here comes the important sentence \u0152 not everybody can be a pioneer. And I think that\u2122s true. I think that there are people who are willing to fight and to be confrontational, and tell people, who say I \u0152 I \u0152 I don\u2122t think I\u2122m up to that. And you can try and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and influence people, but basically it is also true that some people are pioneers and some people are not. You need the pioneers and you must accept that there are some people who are not. So, when we got into subsequent discussions, I remember some people I considered racist in the poverty program, saying, you know, we\u2122d come out of the building from work and there would be some news headlines out in the street, and they would say that Stokey Carmichael , or Rap Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 83Brown, aren\u2122t they awful troublemakers, what have you. Now, Martin Luther King, that\u2122s a different proposition. And I said, aren\u2122t you forgetting that that\u2122s how you looked at Martin, until the more extreme Stokey Carmichaels and Rap Brown came on the scene, by which the \u0152 yesterdays revolutionary becomes the classicist, just like we were saying in th e arts, or in other things, you see? They \u0152 the extreme of today makes the extreme of yesterday the conservative. In fact, sometimes pathetically so. And \u0152 and that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s how \u0152 ho-how that played, and it was an ongoing \u0152 an ongoing discu ssion, and I feel that it has progressed. But one thing we learned in the poverty program is that we were trying to redress past wrongs. If you ask the redressee, have we redressed wrongs enough, the answer is inevitably that we have barely scratched the surface. That leads to someone wanting to put on the brakes, if only for political reasons, because if you are doing something that is unpopular w ith the general public because they say you are redressing too much, and unpopular with the redressees, because they say you are not redressing enough, you are losing on both sides. You are losing politically and you are losing the things you are setting out to do. So, you have a very, very, very serious problem, and you in evitably begin to repress a bit together with redressing. In other words, when you put the br akes on redressing wrongs, you are repressing th-the people. By that I mean you are denying them some of the redressing they would like to have, because they \u0152 you \u0152 you can\u2122t do as much as Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 84they want you to do. So, this \u0152 the rather delicate balance between redressing and repressing \u0152 and by repressing I don\u2122t mean any \u0152 any acts of \u0152 of \u0152 of \u0152 of keeping somebody down, I\u2122m merely calling it the insufficient redressing which is perceived as repression, all right? So wh en you do this \u0152 this \u0152 this delicate balance. You come to the point where it\u2122s almost impossible to walk the tightrope and your political opponents will scream bloody murder that you are redressing too much. And then you have protesters outside your building saying you are not redressing enough. Now, Shriver had a great talent for this, he would go down on the sidewalk to the protesters, invite them to his office and sit down with them and reason with them. His successors barricaded themselves in th e building, stopped the elevator service, which again illustrates the misconception that things that move forward continue to move forward, they don\u2122t. Well, I found that i-in \u0152 in some ways progression continues to progre ss, perhaps. An example that comes to mind is anti-Semitism which probably belongs here. When I first came to this country and \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in the \u0152 the end of the 40s, the beaches around Washington had signs saying Gen tiles only. Not whites only, Gentiles only. And it was in \u0152 understood without saying that that meant white Gentiles, okay? And there was Father Coughlin and there was Bilbo up on the hill spouting antiSemitism and the likes of which we have mercifully forgotten, how blatant and \u0152 and \u0152 and crude that anti-sin \u0152 Semitism wa \u0152 seemed acceptable on the floor of Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 85the house. Now, shall we say that has become unfashionable, or deemed primitive, whatever, I don\u2122t know. And I find it difficult to picture that it would return in totality. Perhaps there\u2122s some elements of the extreme so-called religious right that would like to revive those days. I\u2122m sure they wouldn\u2122t admit it at this point, because as I say, it\u2122s unfashionable, and recognized to be primitive, which I think is a good thing. But we shouldn\u2122t delude ourselves that there aren\u2122t places where the attitude exists. I find it exists in \u0152 in Europe to a \u0152 to a considerable extent, more overtly than in \u0152 in the United States now. I was told yesterday by a man who told me that his father was a Nazi, that there is m \u0152 that in Germany, even though there is this movement of \u0152 of \u0152 of the young who \u0152 who \u0152 who abhor their Nazi past, or the Nazi past of their parents, and this man abhors the Nazi past of his father, but he says his father was unemployed, and he was an engineer and he was repairing radios to make a living of sorts. And when Hitler came to power he got a job as an engineer. So he thought that \u0152 he \u0152 he said, what they are doing to the Jews is \u0152 that\u2122s bad, bad. Bu t look what it has done for me. And von Stauffenberg, who tried to assassinate Hitler is considered a traitor by one and all, by the vast majority of people. I found that shocking, I didn\u2122t know that, I thought \u0152 and I still believe there are segments of the people who consider him a resistance person. This \u0152 this man told me that there isn\u2122t a single memorial or monument to Stauffenberg, because vast majority of people consider him a Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 86traitor. Now, I \u0152 I\u2122ve \u0152 I \u0152 I find that \u0152 I mean, that came as a shock. I did not know that. I thought that the disillusionment with Hitler and \u0152 and by saying disillusionment I\u2122m implying that there was an illusionment before, and \u0152 and there certainly was. And some of it, if you will understand the burden, like the man who didn\u2122t have a job that got a job, like the peculiar historic situation where you have a German Reich that was 90 years old. Before that there were duchies and principalities of \u0152 of Munich, Saxony , whatever. Prussia. And that after losing World War I, there was \u0152 first of all, it was kept intact, as opposed to the Austro-Hungarian empire, which was 2,000 years old and was completely chopped up because of the ethnic elements, all of whom had been caught in this thing we just mentioned about th-ththe tightrope between repression and redressing, because if an Austrian emperor or Austrian government tried to redress the demands of the Hungarians, or the Serbs, or the Czechs, it was politically unpopular at home and deemed insufficient by the recipients of the programs, who wanted out, never mind how and just soon er better than later. As indeed we are now seeing in Bosnia and in all these places where small minorities, whether they are viable or not, completely not caring about whether they can form a viable entity, want to be nationalistically independent. Even the most reasonable among them, and I have talked to some of the most reasonable, will say that first we must have our independence and then we can a ttempt to confederate. In the meantime, Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 87the process of getting that independence is bloody and \u0152 and destructive. And unreasonable. And \u0152 and there\u2122 s nothing we seem to be able to do about it because we don\u2122t necessarily progress. Now, in Germany , this \u0152 this relatively recent empire of \u0152 of \u0152 of 90 year old confederation, they y earned to be powerful again. Understandably, the Austro-Hungarians never had any dream of becoming a powerful empire again, because that would mean gluing together the thing where the glue hadn\u2122t held, o-of \u0152 of \u0152 of ethnic minorities, you see? So they never had that ambition, except perhaps in the case of some Austrians who were pan \u0152 panGerman thinkers, and thought as part of the German empire, they could see some greatness again. But I wouldn\u2122t say there were many until Hitler demonstrated that that dream of be \u0152 of \u0152 of \u0152 of regaining power for this German entity could be realized, in that he was immensely successful politically and \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and militarily. And took over one country after the other, right? And if your victorious armies are marching into country after country with a minimum of casualties, and asserting themselves as \u0152 as the masters of the world, it\u2122s probably hard for the average citizen not to stand and cheer at \u0152 at the sidelines, when all that technological hardware is rolling past you and \u0152 and the pageantry, at which they were very good. They were very, very skilled in visual pageantry. Well, the \u0152 I see a bridge here to something else we wanted to cover, which is Vietnam. The bridge is this; when the Vietnam situation started, I, after my six years of war and being Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 88an officer in the British army, in an elite unit, thought that that was the reasonable thing to do. I thought that the domino theory, which had been demonstrated by Hitler, that is you don\u2122t stop him when he first occupies the Rhineland , then he will occupy Austria, Czechoslovakia and then continue the rest of western Europe , all right? If you \u0152 what you should have done, clearly, was to stop him when he occupied the Rhineland . Well, the parallels seemed obvious. The big threat now was communism. If they took over Vietnam and one didn\u2122t stop them there, they would take over the rest of southeast Asia. And not necessarily as a popular movement, but as a enslaving kind of mechanism. Well, true or false, right? What subsequently changed my mind, not very long after, was the painful realization that just before \u0152 because you are right \u0152 and even that, of course, becomes \u0152 is arguable, but even if you pe rceive yourself to be right, you can\u2122t undertake things that are \u0152 that you\u2122re going to lose. It\u2122s impractical. So for pragmatic reasons if nothing else, the idea of subduing communism in Vietnam, which turned out to be a popular nationa listic movement, if you are going to \u0152 to fight a losing war, the answer obviously is don\u2122t \u0152 don\u2122t go in the first place. That means admitting that you can\u2122t do it. And \u0152 and that takes a lot \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s sometimes harder to do for a head of state to say, we think we ought to be doing this, but we can\u2122t. It\u2122s harder to do than to say okay, go. A-And then afterwards, when you have enormous numbers of people killed and \u0152 and maimed, there is, of Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 89course, no \u0152 no easy way back. You \u0152 you can\u2122t bring them back. But, in a sense, those who were afraid of a domino theory had their \u0152 their fears borne out to a considerable extent. After awhile when \u0152 when \u0152 when communism itself became the image of a failed methodology, the whole thing seems redundant. I mean, what communism were we afraid of? Russian communism, Chinese communism. Well, Russian communism as \u0152 is \u0152 i-is \u0152 is gone. Chinese communism is metamorphosing in all \u0152 into all kinds of other things. Whether we are justifiably afraid of that now, is really, A, it \u0152 it \u0152 it doesn\u2122t apply in the same sense as it applied at that time. And there were proba bly a couple of other factors in there. I think that we are still in this country resentful of the former colonial powers, because after all, we were under British ru le, and so, if the British were pushed out of the Persian gulf, that didn\u2122t really hurt us. I-If the French were pushed out of Vietnam, Indochina, that \u0152 we were gonna do it better. We were gonna show them that i-it spilt \u0152 the failure was because they were colonial powers. Well, our trying to get into these things with limited experience and assume a pseudo colonial role in c \u0152 in \u0152 in countries i-in the Persian gulf, or in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in southeast Asia, hasn\u2122t worked out too well. And \u0152 because the world is readjusting itself and \u0152 and the \u0152 yesterday\u2122s methods progressed as na \u0152 as \u0152 it begins to be questionable whether progress is progress as we perceive it. And also, it doesn\u2122t necessarily go forward. It goes \u0152 I-I would think that if you asked people the \u0152 the Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 90academic question whether they would prefer the Persian gulf to be as it was, which means playing footsy with the shah , who was not necessarily a democratic leader, we\u2122d probably happily settle for that at \u0152 at this moment, instead of what we\u2122ve got. What can you do? I-It \u0152 the \u0152 and \u0152 and \u0152 and as for the \u0152 the non-viable mini-states that spring up as nationalist units, the example of Slovakia having split off from Czech Republic, because they felt that they were treated like underdogs, with justification. But, by themselves much less viable, and I\u2122m sure that a great many of them are sorry that they split off. There is no visible easy way back to that confederation, that comes after the national thing, as I have been told, you know. No easy way back. So we are \u0152 we are perpetually shooting ourselves in the foot all over, I mean, not you and I, but people everywhere, in their own situations. [break]"

And you had told me about your professional career, and you told me about the social changes that you saw in this country in the 60s and into the 70s. But you haven\u2122t spoken to me about your personal life a nd your family. Can you tell me about your family? Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 91",
            "answer": "Well, I came, if you recall, from \u0152 from England on a Fulbright and sterling \u0152 pounds sterling were not convertible, so I had no money. And the art schools were not boarding schools, so I liv ed at International House in New York at 500 Riverside Drive. And that was very stimulating because there were students from all over, and many friends, which I maintain to this day. Some of them I haven\u2122t \u0152 I hadn\u2122t seen in, I guess almost 50 years, but my friendships are of the nature that I can pick them up any time as if there had been no time gap. We had recently been to Hawaii , where I had friends from International Student House whom I hadn\u2122t seen since. And it worked like we had never parted. I \u0152 one day, a Greek student in New York who lived at the house, said let\u2122s hitchhike to Washington. I\u2122m going to hitchhike to Washington, anybody want to come along? I said sure. I \u0152 I\u2122ve never been there, and I know somebody in Washington. Let me try and telephone and see whether I can arrange something. So I did what in those days was an unusual activity, a long distance telephone call. And I went and called Washington, and I had no address of the person I was looking for, who had been the fianc\u00e9e of a friend of mine who was a commando colleague in \u0152 in England and in Normandy , we b-both went in on the same team to Normandy , and we were very, very close friends. And we double dated in England . I was engaged to an Irish girl from northern Ireland. Have we covered that before? Well, the \u0152 his fianc\u00e9e was \u0152 had come out on the ch \u0152 ki \u0152 children\u2122s transport from Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 92Czechoslovakia and had work in London for the Czech government in exile until the coup in Czechoslovakia when she lost her job. She had been alone to the second international conference, annual co nference of the International Monetary Fund, and they had offered her a job in Washington. And when she lost her job in London, she accepted the job in Washington , because why not, for a year, and had \u0152 in other words, come for a year at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. I couldn\u2122t remember the name of the International Monetary Fund and I first asked th-the Washington telephone operator whether I \u0152 she had a listing by name, and she didn\u2122t. So I said we ll, there\u2122s an organization that belongs to the United Nations. And she said, the United Nations are in Flushing Meadows, New York. And I said, I know that, but there is some branch, it\u2122s called the United Nations Fund, or the United Nations bank, or something. And she said, sir, United Nations are in Flushing Meadows, Long Island, New York. After we\u2122d been over that a couple of times, I said, I tell you what, forget it, and I hung up. Obviously I wasn't going to ge t anywhere and I went to see the Greek student who had wanted to hitchhike to Washington, and I said, I\u2122m having problems about this Washington thing, I can\u2122t reach my party. And he said, I\u2122ve decided not to go. I said okay, it\u2122s off. So it didn\u2122t happen. Awhile later, Alice went to London on home leave, London being her home, and met with our mutual friend and \u0152 and other friends from the commandos. And they said, oh, Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 93when you go back through New York , you must bring this book that is just out to Peter. The book was \ufb01The Green Beret,\ufb02 the first book about the commandos by Hilary Saint George Saunders, a historian. And she had said, oh , Peter is in New York? I didn\u2122t know that. And she brought me the book. Now, I \u0152 I have to go back a moment and say that when she left for \u0152 for Washington from London, her fianc\u00e9 said to me, I have \u0152 he was in business already and I was in art school \u0152 he said, I have a shipment coming in in the docks, and I can\u2122t take off, I have to be there. But you are an art student, you can take time off. Why don\u2122t you go with her to \u0152 whatever it was, Cooks , and help her make the arrangements? Anyone who knows Alice knows that she needed my help lik e the hole in the head. She \u0152 when she worked for the International Monetary Fund, she made travel arrangements for 60 people, and my helping he r was a laugh. But I took time off and went down the road to Cooks on Southampton Row, King\u2122s Way, which was five minutes from my school, and gave her, as \u0152 as a matter of fact, a going away present of one of my little Ashanti gold weights that I had acquired during my six months in Africa at the end of the war. And she brought me the book and I told her the story about how I had almost come to Washington and she said, well, you must come and see Washington. And I said sure. And of course, having no money, I hitchhiked. Holland tunnel or whatever, and in those days , if you got a ride straight through it took seven and a half hours, and you never got a ride straight through, so it took Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 9410 - 11 - 12 hours. And I would start at \u0152 after school, about four o\u2122clock, and \u0152 and hitchhike. There was, of course, no New Jersey turnpike. There was no bridge over the Delaware. There was a ferry. There was no tunnel under Baltimore and no route 95, but route one with traffic li ghts and what have you. I usually hit Baltimore in the early hours of the morning, like two o\u2122clock a-and \u0152 and usually on a truck which dropped me off somewher e in the harbor district. And on one occasion, two potential muggers followed me and in fact I \u0152 I had a suitcase and a portfolio to carry, so they could walk faster than I could, and they \u0152 I \u0152 I decided I w \u0152 I would \u0152 I would walk in the middle of the road so I wouldn\u2122t be pulled in anywhere, and I stopped and they came and said, at two in the morning, and asked me for a light. And I said, I don\u2122t smoke. Is there anything else you want? And I had a metal suitcase which I held, which I wa s going to throw at them and run, if necessary. And they decided that this was not a good proposition and they decided not to \u0152 to mug me. And \u0152 but it was an unpleasant incident and looked very threatening. And a \u0152 another story that comes to mind is it \u0152 one time it poured, and it was just before Alice\u2122s birthday and I was \u0152 I ha d bought her ano \u0152 a new umbrella, and it was gift wrapped. And I carried that umbrella gift wrapped and wouldn\u2122t open it because I didn\u2122t want to spoil the thing, I carried it under my jacket so it wouldn\u2122t get wet. Anyway, after hitchhiking to Washington a few times, w-we met in New York and in Washington. And in the following spring, Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 951950, we were married. And Alice had arranged some interviews for me in Washington to find a job, and the person who was going to help me find the job ran a small public relations agency, and he desired \u0152 he si \u0152 he decided that he would hire me himself and call it public re lations and advertising and I was the art director of this small outfit, and it was not an altogether positive experience. I think I earned 30 dollars a week and that was low even by the standards of that time. But I had quite some exposure. I did three full color ads for \ufb01Esquire\ufb02 magazine and I found that I had to solic it some of the jobs because nobody else seemed to be doing it and after awhile everybody quit and I was the only employee. But one of them ha d preceded me into television and he offered me a \u0152 a job in television. We\u2122ve \u0152 may have covered that before. Anyway, in the meantime, A-Alice and I had moved into a one room apartment on \u0152 on Belmont Street in Washington, which was rather \u0152 rather primitive, but not \u0152 not at all bad, and after a period we moved downtown in to an air conditioned apartment. That was the height of luxury. Small one, also . And we had our first child, a daughter, Anne, who from a very early age wanted to do professi onally exactly what I was doing and \u0152 and helped me, even as a child . And got very proficient and became a good graphic designer and is one to this day. Then we had a second daughter , Kim, who also \u0152 all of them leaned in di rections that I had marginally been involved in. She started to write poetry, which we have done traditionally in my Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 96family for every birthday. And of course, she went beyond that and she became a writer and is at this stage a contributing editor to \ufb01Vanity Fair\ufb02 and \ufb01 Time\ufb02 magazine, and is writing her s econd book, called tentatively, \ufb01Keys to the Kingdom,\ufb02 meaning Michael Eisner and the Disney operation. That\u2122s big league writing, not the sort of thing that \u0152 that I\u2122m doing. Well, as \u0152 this morning, as a matter of fact, in looking for a certain book, I came across the album of \u0152 of birthday cards over the years, and it\u2122s qu ite a collection because they are both graphics and \u0152 and \u0152 and at least doggerel verse, and it\u2122s a heartwarming memento that I \u0152 I \u0152 I think i-I \u0152 astonished me because I had forgotten some of them, they\u2122ve been so long ago. But the tradition goes on. The tradition also goes on to my third child which \u0152 Tim, a \u0152 a \u0152 a son who works for the Discovery Channel as senior manager of special events, and lives only five minutes from my house. And he writes absolutely beautiful birthday poets \u0152 poems. Everybody knows what birthday poems sound like and I sometimes wince at the bad meter and \u0152 and the suggested ego trip of all of us who do this. But my daughter Kim and my son Tim, write absolutely gorgeous ones, far better than anything I\u2122ve ever done. And incidentally, my children being named Anne, Kim and Tim, the last one was Kim\u2122s idea, together with the support of her older sister. And we said, if we call him Tim and we calling you \u0152 him \u0152 or we call you, you will never know which one we are calling because it sounds alike. And she said, that\u2122s the idea. A-As you Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 97can see where she comes from. Well, they\u2122re all married. Anne is married to an architect and lives in Washington and has three children; David, who is now 11, Sam, who is nine and Hannah who is almost six. And Kim had great trouble \u0152 she is married to Gary Simpson, who is in television, movies in Hollywood. She \u0152 Kim moved to Hollywood because she covers Hollywood. She used to work for the \ufb01Washington Post\ufb02 for many years for style, but now she doesn\u2122t work for a papers, she writes the book and contributes articles to those two publications. She had great difficulty having a baby. She had 10 in-vitros attempting to have a baby, all failed. And ultimately succeeded by having a \u0152 a surrogate carry her child. The baby is hers and her husband\u2122s, implante d into a surrogate, who carried it and it\u2122s now a few months old, a little girl. And the \u0152 one thing that comes to mind is when she and the surrogate were together in th e hospital for the birth of the baby, the baby cried during the night, and Kim said, the baby is crying. And the surrogate mother said, it\u2122s not my baby, you go and ta ke care of it. And she has been doing that happily ever since. Took some adjustment, because when you don\u2122t carry the baby, the impact on your life, whe \u0152 whic h suddenly changes without the relief of not carrying it any more is \u0152 is quite an e xperience, that I hadn\u2122t really anticipated. But she adjusted to it very well, and now all is going ve ry well. And as we sit here and speak, Tim and his wife Laurie, who also works for Discovery cable television, she is vice-president in charge of marketing, expect their first baby. The Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 98phone could ring now. I know we\u2122ve turned them off, but even so, and she might be having that baby. We don\u2122t know wh ether it\u2122s a boy or a girl, any \u0152 any day now. The \u0152 all three children, by the way, we nt to school in \u0152 in this area, in the Washington area, and all three of them didn't like high school, and wanted to get out as soon as possible. So, it was possible in the district to take, I don\u2122t know, English four and I forget what else, math, over the summer and graduate early. All three of them did that. You didn\u2122t have to be brilliant to graduate early, just had to take a couple of summer courses. And they wanted to avoid the graduation ceremony, none of them wanted to go th rough it, peculiarly perhaps, and all of them wanted out. And all of them \u0152 each one of them did something different with the year they gained by graduating a year early. Anne worked for a design studio before she went to art school. She had helped me all along. And after a period of good experience, went to Pratt in \u0152 in New York, and was in many ways ahead, because she had the practical experience. And this was in a period when practicality was not big in the art schools. You know, they would say, design a logo for \u0152 design a logo for a \u0152 an \u0152 and use \u0152 draw it on a brick. If that sounds absurd, that was \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m doing this on purpose, or a cinder block, because that was characteristic of the time. Practicality was not the main thing. You did things that were impractical, but original, okay? It was the post-modern I talked to you about before. Well, so that was how she spent her year that she gained. Kim did Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 99something entirely different. She went to visit my wife\u2122s sister in London. And in London the county council runs all kinds of courses, which are affordable and very, very good. So she learned \u0152 she took courses in all the things she might want to be interested in later, having no idea where she was going to go. She took one in psychology, one in ceramics, one in Italian, one in drama, and I forget what else. And after she was through, she decided none of the above, and she became an English major, and now it became very important at what school she was to continue. And one of my co lleagues on \u0152 a very senior older person in the poetry program, had been a president of Bryn Mawr, and she \u0152 and when I talked about the program said, oh Kim absolutely must go to Bryn Mawr and she took her there. And there was a sort of a \u0152 it really fitted Kim like \u0152 like a glove. There is a traditional Poet Laureate in Bryn Mawr who is anonymous un \u0152 and writes under the name of Applebee , which was the name of the gym teacher who introduced hockey to schools in the United States. And Applebee is selected by the outgoing Applebee after submissions of sample poems . And nobody knows who it is, and they write snide poems about \u0152 well, critical of \u0152 of \u0152 of the school management or whatever, or social gossip bu \u0152 and wi th \u0152 with double entendres galore. And Kim became Applebee in her junior year, I think. And the \u0152 the \u0152 I \u0152 I even recall the interview because Kim had read more books than anybody I know, and sh \u0152 before she went to college. And when yo u go for an interview they want to see Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 100your reading list. And she went to Cornell and they looked at her reading list, which was a \u0152 a foldout, a-a \u0152 it was so long, and said, about what we would expect and that offended Kim deeply because she knew it wasn\u2122t true. It was a putdown, you see. And at Bryn Mawr, when she showed her reading list, the interviewer put it aside after glancing at it and said yes, but what is your favorite \u0152 who is your favorite author? And Kim said, without hesitation, Jane Austen . And the interviewer said, she is mine too, let\u2122s talk about Jane Austen. They talked for three hours about Jane Austen. So there\u2122s no question she was going to go anywhere else. Tim used his extra year to take an internship in television, because he had been interested in \u0152 in radio and television from being a \u0152 a toddler. In fact, in his house hangs a picture of him with his first phonograph when he was about four years old, and he is carefully putting down the needle, and subsequently worked as a disc jockey for the university of dis \u0152 dis \u0152 District of Columbia station. He had a program called Jazzmasters with Tim Masters. And when C-Span bought the station and there was no more jazz, the hearts of all the listeners bled, because they were so attached to that classical jazz program. And he misses it. He did it for, I think 12 years, as a sideline, unpaid. But he has been in \u0152 in some form of \u0152 of broadcasting all \u0152 all his life. Well, where were we? Yes, my wife Alice, who came for a year, stayed for 36 years. She became an administrative officer, and her \u0152 by now there are few people left who remember Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 101her, but there are some, and when we go th ere for some function, or if we meet somebody by chance, she would \u0152 was literally a legend in that organization, because having been a \u0152 a \u0152 from a children\u2122s transport, you know, and having been self reliant from an early teenage age, she was so protective of the people working on the staff, that she would tell newly arrivals that the first thing they\u2122d have to do is to start thinking of their careers in term s of security and retirement and so on. And very few people \u0152 very fe w young people think about that at all. And now there are many \u0152 there are many out there who are thanking her for her being so solicitous. And she is a most rema rkable person. She is a \u0152 a \u0152 the \u0152 the fastest at many things that I can \u0152 that I\u2122ve ever seen. I mean, if I \u0152 if we go shopping and I get out of the car and I can\u2122t see where she is, it is because she is already in the house, having carried 50 percent of the bags and dinner is almost ready. You know, that sort of thing. And she never hesitated to have a social life, to \u0152 to invite people, while she was working. And how \u0152 how is \u0152 is \u0152 by today\u2122s standards, unimaginable. And \u0152 and I \u0152 I don\u2122t think \u0152 I mean, some of my children have to have \u0152 have dinner party, what have yo u. But to think of the kind of dinner party she would have fo-for frie nds after she came home from work, and it was ready and delicious at the time when you didn\u2122t think she had hung up her coat yet. It\u2122s just a very special talent. When we were recently visiting friends on Cape Cod, we had an engagement to which we had to go, I\u2122ll come back to that Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 102later, and we were going to have dinner afterwards, at our guests\u2122. And we had been talking about a continent-ental dessert that is \u0152 is a big favorite in central and eastern Europe. And in central and eastern Europe it\u2122s a dessert \u0152 it\u2122s a dumpling, either with plums or apricots. But she has figured out that it\u2122s better with peaches, because there\u2122s more fruit and the peaches are so good in this country, and in \u0152 particularly this year, by the way. So, she said, I\u2122m going to make that for dessert. And they said, well do it afterwards, because we really have to go. And she said, it won\u2122t take a minute. She had du-dumplings for five people ready while the others were putting on their jackets to go to the function. And so when we came back, all she had to do is put them in the water, a nd they were done, you know, I mean none \u0152 none of them could believe that she ha d actually accomplished that in this extremely narrow time span. Doesn\u2122t bother her [indecipherable]. And she has become a most valued counselor for my activities, which of course means particularly the book I have written. And the reason I wrote that book is because I felt that as the interest in the Holocaust and in World War II revived, people were writing books and telling stories that were horrible, and in recounting their \u0152 their stories, and I felt that someone ought to st ress the fact that not everybody went like sheep to the slaughter, but some of us had the fortunate opportunity to be able to fight back. So I \u0152 and in addition, I wa nted to commemorate all those who were less lucky that I was, because a lot of my refugee friends who su cceeded in ha \u0152 in Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 103\u0152 in doing special and hazardo us duty, were killed or maimed or at least wounded. I was one of the lucky ones that came through without a scratch except a tiny grenade splinter in my rear end that I threw myself in house clearing, by being a little cowboy-like \u0152 cavalier about how I tossed the grenade. Which was partly encouraged by the management to be a little macho. Came with the job. So, I wrote my first book as a septuagenarian. It took me years and years to do it, because I had no idea how one writes a book. But I\u2122d always had the inclination to tell stories, as you can tell fro m this interview. So I \u0152 I first wrote \u0152 I tried to do it by tape recording while walking the dog wh en I\u2122d had a heart attack. And I \u0152 my children ga-gave \u0152 borrowed somebody\u2122s dog or something, a very ugly Dalmatian. And I had to walk this dog twice a day, and they gave me a tape recorder and they said, that way you can get your \u0152 the book you always talk about, written. And I recorded while walking the dog. You can hear cars going by and stuff. And then I tried to get it transcribed, because I can\u2122t type. And I found several people who said they woul d do it, and they had two common denominators. One, they were very expensive, and two, they were absolutely incompetent at understanding what I was sa ying, perhaps because of my accent, perhaps because there are many proper nouns in there that they were unfamil \u0152 that were unfamiliar to them. And I str uggled. I tried to transcribe it myself, I found I couldn\u2122t do it. So some friend said, you got to get yourself a word Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 104processor and I did. It\u2122s a very primitive machine, a word processor and the printer. And I struggled to learn it and found that every now and again it would absolutely balk and not do what I told it to do. So I needed to call friends to help me to get it going again, to jumpstart it. And I found th at this happened so often, that one friend wouldn\u2122t do it, I couldn\u2122t bother the same person, so I alternated about three friends and called them with my emergencies, in the middle of the night at times, because I couldn\u2122t stop, I had to go on. And that \u0152 that \u0152 with their patience and my persistence, that seemed to work. And then I talked to some publishers without submitting it, but I \u0152 I submitted, I think a synopsis to one in England, with whom I met and he said, you kno w, it doesn\u2122t all have to be true. And that finished it as far as I was concerned, because that was precisely my purpose, that it should all be true. H-He sa id, you know, faction is acceptable. And I \u0152 as long as you have a thrill on every pa ge. I thought there were enough thrills without having to invent them. So we parted before we even started. And then I \u0152 I went to various people for advice and some of the advi ce was good and some of it was \u0152 was not. Some people said, you must have more dialog, some people said you must have less dialog. Some people sa id you must be sequential. And I think that\u2122s true. People want to know how it continues."

            "question": "Speaking of continuing, I have to pa use to change the tape. Just one moment. [break] This is an continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 105volunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape four, side B, and you were telling me about yo ur book, and the genesis of your book. Let me first ask you, can you give me the title of your book?",
            "answer": "The book is called, \ufb01Striking Back.\ufb02 I \u0152 I literally polled some of my commando friends and other people for a title and they made all kinds of suggestions. I can\u2122t pin down where the title ultimately came from, except perhaps i-in discussion between the publisher and myself, and utilizing, and re \u0152 rattling off all the names that have been suggested. And the publisher wrote the subtitle modified from something that I suggested, namely, it\u2122s called \ufb01 Striking Back: A Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazis.\ufb02 I wanted to say Jewish refugee commandos, but they said, the word refugee has a different connotation nowadays and people wouldn\u2122t know what it means in this context. And besides, it\u2122s too long. So there it is, a Jewish refugees war against the Nazis. And a \u0152 well, how did I find a publisher and be \u0152 believe me, people have asked me since, how do you get a book published, like I\u2122m the expert. And of course I \u0152 first time author, and I \u0152 what do I know? So, the \u0152 the way \u0152 the way this came about was that the historian Stephen Ambrose , who was the head of the \u0152 president of the Eisenhower Institute in New Orleans, and professor at the University of Louisiana in New Orleans, and the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, called together D-Day veterans from \u0152 mostly from the U.S. forces, but some from \u0152 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 106from England and one from Germany. And \u0152 people who had experienced D-Day. And a friend in New York, Harry Nomberg (ph) called me, he was a commando friend, he served under the name of Harry Drew , and he said, my wife and I are going, why don\u2122t you come with Alice? And we decided we\u2122d all go. And we had work sessions and it was abso lutely fascinating because you could talk to people who had been involved in some other activity on D-Day that I had seen but never fully understood. And no w you could ask questions, how did you do this? How did these rocket firing craft work that were on our left, and so on. And we all submitted a tape beforehand and Ambrose told me that he liked mine am \u0152 and considered it to be among his best. And we \u0152 and then he wrote the book, D-Day, which became a best seller and my story is in there in multiple installments about my D-Day experience. So I mentioned to him that I we \u0152 was \u0152 I wanted to write a book, for the reasons I\u2122ve already stated. And he said, you must absolutely. And I said, don\u2122t I need an agent? And he said, yes you do, why don\u2122t you use mine? And he re commended me to his agent in New York , and that didn\u2122t work out at all, because the man told me on th \u0152 I never met him, but the man told me on the phone that he was suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and it would be quite some time before he got around to reading my book, because he \u0152 he couldn\u2122t in his present condition. That was very discouraging. Secondly \u0152 I mean, I had notions that I\u2122d get it out for the 50th anniversary of D-Day, and it \u0152 I Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 107was clearly not going to make it. Then he said, it will require extensive editing, and he recommended an editor to me, who said he charged 250 dollars an hour. And I said, I can\u2122t afford for you to read my book, leave alone to edit it. And we made a \u0152 an agreement that I would pay him an amount for giving me advice, after reading some of the book. And he gave me some advice, some of it good, some of it I discarded, which was to be anticipated. Then a man published a book about my overall unit, that is a \u0152 my \u0152 my commando unit, in which I was fortunate enough to \u0152 to be able to strike back. It was number three troop, 10 commando. The 10 commando had two French troops, a Dutch troop, a Norwegian troop, a Polish troop. I think we\u2122ve been through that. And he wrote about all of us, you know, so we were one chapter in that book. And this man had done considerable research and was familiar with all the dramatis personae. So I told \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 he offered to help me edit, and \u0152 and to advise me. And in return, he was writing additional books on the SOE, special operations of the U.S. \u0152 of the allied forces, and he needed research done at the National Archives, because it didn\u2122t exist in England. So I did the research for him for days on end, and found very interesting things that he could use in his book and in retu rn he \u0152 we exchanged tapes and he advised me. When I told Stephen Ambrose that he and \u0152 that I \u0152 I didn\u2122t get along with his agent, he said, oh, I haven\u2122t used him in years. But naturally it didn\u2122t occur to him to, you know, to \u0152 to call me and say I didn't use \u0152 I don\u2122t use that agent any Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 108more. And he said, well, there are several options, and one of the ideas that came up was that I should talk to the people at the Holocaust Museum. And I talked to Mr. Aronowitz at the Holocaust Museum, who had been in publishing in a previous life, and he said, tell you what I\u2122ll do. I-I will print out publishers who I think would be interested in your book. Now, they won\u2122t all be big publishers, some of them specialize in military memoirs and that\u2122s probably a prime consideration. And he printed out the list and the top publisher on the list was Presidio Press in California, and I sent them \u0152 a-and Mr. Aronowitz advised me that the way to do it was to telephone and ask for the acquisition editor. Now, the average first time author doesn\u2122t know that, and sends it blind. Well, I sent it to the acquisition editor and got a letter back saying we are interested in your book. First publisher I submitted it to. And they accepted the book, they said they print 20 volumes a year, and they get 1600 submissi ons. And before the book was printed, it was ti \u0152 the movie options were bought by Miramax. And recently the German translation options were bought by a Ge rman publisher, whom I\u2122m trying to contact to offer my services in case they need any help, because I want to make sure that it\u2122s done right. Now, the book has totally changed my life. As a first time septuagenarian author, I am being asked to speak here, there and everywhere and to give book talks. The story I told you about the fruit dumplings, the commitment to which we were not to be late was at the Eldredge Library in Chatham on Cape Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 109Cod. And this is a retiree audience, by no means Jewish, and they were a marvelous audience. And I spoke for about an hour, and then I \u0152 we had a book signing at the bookstore about three houses away. And I said, I think I \u0152 I have to finish now, so that we make it in time to the bookstore. And the people started to yell, don\u2122t stop, keep going, we want to hear more. Which is fascinating, I mean it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s \u0152 they were really interested and into it and asked intelligent questions and I have since discovered that in these little New England towns, the library is really the focal point of the community. That\u2122s where people gather. I mean, it\u2122s a sort of intellectual exercise. And that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s always a good sign and very gratifying. But apart from that, and I spoke to an Orthodox synagogue in London where there were 450 people and no microphone because I was billed as the \u0152 the Shabbat preacher, if you will. And so nobody could turn on a microphone and I couldn\u2122t hold a piece of paper, because that\u2122s working. I mean, carrying the piece of paper. And so I thought how, as a serg eant major you would have to shout that you could be heard at the other end of th e parade ground and I thought I sa \u0152 I \u0152 I did that when I was a sergeant, I\u2122ll do it again. Be \u0152 the rabbi was doing it. And it worked very well, and I was given all kinds of honors, opening the ark and closing the ark, I was worried whether it was \u0152 y ou \u0152 you asked earlier about my religious orientation, which was \u0152 activity, which was somewhat marginal. I was Bar Mitzvahed , and my grandfather was a very relig ious man, but he never explained Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 110a \u0152 a \u0152 a word about \u0152 not even at Seder, he just rattled off his prayers and \u0152 and was a \u0152 not a teacher. Well, so I was worried whether I was going to do all these things right in the Orthodox synagogue, I\u2122d never offici ated in \u0152 in any synagogue leave alone an Orthodox one. And they said there will be somebody behind you who will tell you to do all the right things , and it turned out it was very, very simple, it worked very well, and I shook hands for umpteen officials in a given order [indecipherable] traditional. I also spoke at a Reform synagogue to largely veterans. And there is an a-americ \u0152 an organization called AJEX , the Association of Jewish ex-Servicemen and Women. And they organized that in Edgware, a suburb of London. And I spoke there, and when I finished \u0152 again, marvelous audience, the \u0152 there wer-were questions and one man stood up in the audience and said, you say your missi on is to spread the word that you didn\u2122t go like lambs to slaughter, you are accomplishing that, I trust. But you are accomplishing another mission that you don\u2122t even know of. And he held up a British army pay book, which every soldiers carries. And he said, this is my uncle\u2122s pay book. I\u2122m a member of the Sachs (ph) family of \u0152 of refugees from Germany. And my uncle served under the name of Seymour in your commando troop. And until we read your book just now, the family did not know what happened to him beyond the war office telegram saying that he was killed in action. In your book you say that i-in the night assault crossing of the river Rhine, you were in a amphibious track Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 111cra \u0152 vehicle called the Buffalo, and that the Buffalo next to yours in mid-river was hit and burst into flames, and that nobody got out alive, as far as you know. And two of the people on it, you say, were Fogel(ph) and Sachs (ph) who served under the name of [indecipherable] and Seymour. And this is the first time we found out what happened to my uncle. And that brings closure to our feelings and we thank you for it. And people in the audience started to cry, and it was very emotional, and I felt that it somehow made it all worthwhile to have done this, and struggled to write the book and to do th is. And that\u2122s by no means all. I had the phone call from a woman who said that her name was Claudine Schindler . Actually Claudine Arbour Schin-Schindler . And she had seen the article about me that was caused by my book in the B\u2122nai B\u2122rith international magazine, th-the monthly. And it said that my name had been Arany, and her name had been Arany, and were we related? And she started to lay out her family. And she is the granddaughter of my father\u2122s oldest brot her, who was a \u0152 quite a character, in fact the name Arany was invented by him. The family name had been Freed(ph) but on \u0152 being in Hungary he wanted to have a Hungarian name, and what\u2122s more, he was a sort of macho character who in the 20s wore a black leather jacket and rode a red Indian motorcycle. And my father imitated him in almost everything, his older brother. They were both jewelers. Arany in Hungarian means gold, so it was sort of a pun to have that name. And in addition, it\u2122s the name of the national poet Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 112of Hungary, Arianosh (ph), and aristocratic, he wanted tha \u0152 obviously. And he \u0152 he was divorced from a very nice woman whom I knew much better than I knew my Uncle Carol (ph), Ilsa(ph) who ran a \u0152 a pensionne in the country that belonged to some very wealthy relatives of hers. But she was sort of the poor relative. Lovely woman, who invited us as children a couple of times to this pensionne in the country and I have very ni ce memories of that. We had to be on our best behavior because of all the el egant people there. And she had two sons, Aussie(ph) and Jurry (ph) Arany, and apparently they got out. We were not in touch. And they got out and lived in France throughout the war, running from place to place in hiding, as people did who survived in France. And then one of them got \u0152 oh, in France they changed the name Arany to Arbor, spelled like the English word arbor, but pronounced arbore (ph). And one of them got to Brazil, and then got the rest of the family, postwar to Brazil, and some went on to the United States. And this woman was terribly excite d about having found a relative because she didn\u2122t know that she had any relatives at all. And her father is dead, and so is her uncle, the two sons of Carol (ph) and Ilsa(ph). And she said, I will tell my brothers and they\u2122ll probably call you. And the next day I had a telephone call from Brazil, from what is after all a first cousin once removed. And they are all coming \u0152 he is coming to America in November, and he\u2122ll rent a car and bring down as many of the family as he can. And as I said, all very, very excited. So I Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 113found some close relatives I didn't know I had. I mean, I knew they existed, but that\u2122s the next generation, you see? The generation after. And the \u0152 th-th-there are three grown children of the woman in New Jersey, and the \u0152 the youngest just graduated from college. And I did know at on e point that I thought the two sons of my uncle had gotten out, because in London, in her apartment building, my mother needed some wrapping paper once, and she borrowed it from a Mrs. Buerger(ph) who was living at the other end of the corridor. And Mrs. Buerger(ph) gave her a used piece of brown wrapping paper, that\u2122s all she had on hand. And on it was the name of one of these two boys, cousins. But my mother, being divorced from my father, had no interest in taking up a relationship, and she just remembered the fact that she had seen the na me, and so maybe they got out, she said, and I s \u0152 I said, ask Mrs. Buerger whether she knows these people. And nothing ever happened, it \u0152 it ran off into the sand."

            "question": "How has your book been received with respect to sales?",
            "answer": "I have had nothing but excellent reviews. Some of the major papers have not reviewed it. The \u0152 and \u0152 and you learn a whole new thing, you know, about what to \u0152 what did I know about publishing? A wo man called me from \ufb01 The Wall Street Journal ,\ufb02 saying I review books for \ufb01The Wall Street Journal,\ufb02 but they devote very little space to it. I loved your book, but \u0152 and I wrote a review, but it may not appear. And, it didn\u2122t, because there are lots of books and limited space and that\u2122s how it is. And the publisher\u2122s weekly pub \u0152 which guides libraries, published it very favorably, and suddenly at the be \u0152 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 114be \u0152 beginning of last months, the \ufb01Jerusalem Post\ufb02 reviewed it, with a very, very good review. And the \u0152 it \u0152 it suddenly rekindles a \u0152 you know, like \u0152 like a fire that dies down and then catches a \u0152 a flame anew, this goe s on and on. And I get phone calls and letters from people all over the world. I had a letter \u0152 a-and a \u0152 a tape \u0152 a CD from Australia from a man who said he is sending me a CD of the song, \ufb01The Bells of Aberdovey,\ufb02 which is where we trained in North Wales, and I knew of the song. I\u2122ve forgotten how it goes, but I \u0152 I remember it from that time. And he said, I am the firs t tenor on this record, because I am Welsh. I live in Australia now, but I thought you might like to have it. So he sent me a CD of \ufb01The Bells of Aberdovey.\ufb02 I mean, as I say, weird things happen all \u0152 all the time. And various friends whom I \u0152 with whom I had lost contact have contacted me because they\u2122ve heard of \u0152 seen the book and \u0152 and sought me out, or they wrote \u0152 or they wrote to the publisher to forward mail to me . One of my best friends is the son of an Austrian matinee idol who \u0152 Hubert Marischka . His name is Franz Marischka and he lives \u0152 he was in the Pioneer Corps with me, he lives in Munich now. He came to spend the day with me in London from Munich especially. And he is the grandson of Victor L\u00e9on who wrote the libretto for the \ufb01Merry Widow ,\ufb02 and the godson of Franz Lehar . And quite a character in his own right, and we had a marv elous day comparing notes. I would never have recognized him, he is a \u0152 a \u0152 a little portly, bald man, and he was a dashing, blonde, young movie actor when I knew him. So \u0152 but we had a lot of fun. And that happens all the time."

            "question": "What is the status of the movi e that\u2122s being \u0152 that was optioned [indecipherable] Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 115",
            "answer": "The status of the movie may be known to the moviemakers, a-and \u0152 and I \u0152 not even to the publisher, because the publisher handed it to the William Morris Agency, who acts as his agent, and o-other than my having a contract with the publisher for a portion of subsidiary rights, lest anyone thinks that \u0152 well, one of the English papers wrote the last paragraph in a review saying, and Peter Masters sold his book, \ufb01Striking Back,\ufb02 to the movies for a million dollars. Well, don\u2122t you be lieve it. First of all, there\u2122s no million dollars. Secondly, the William Morris Agency gets 10 percent off the top. The publisher gets 50 percent of the remainder. That\u2122s al ready si \u0152 more than 60 percent if you take then off the top. Then my \u0152 my daughter Kim who covers Hollywood told me, you have to have a lawyer when there\u2122s a movie cont ract. And I said, why, naively. And she said, try to go it alone and see what happens to you. So I have a lawyer in Hollywood. He gets five percent, okay? Then they bought the movie option, that doesn\u2122t mean they are making the movie just yet, although they assigned a writer and a producer, which is promising. But I haven\u2122t seen a piece of paper, but when I ask I am told it\u2122s a done deal. So a done deal is a favorite expression in the publishing business. Now, people expect me to tell them how to get books published [indecipherable] and I used to say, look, I\u2122m a novice and I don\u2122t know and that didn\u2122t seem to make them very happy, they thought I was hedging. So after awhile I decided I would try and give them more of an answer. And so I came up with the following formula. And they send me manuscripts, okay? So I said, it takes three ingredients. One, you have to have an unusual story, because no matter how moving your story is, if it is one of many, the chances are it will not get published. So, an unusual story is one. Number two, you have to be able to tell it reasonably well. I Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 116mean, you can be edited and helped, but r easonably well. And the most important ingredient is the third one, and that is luc k. Because I don\u2122t know, I mean, I feel I\u2122ve \u0152 as I say in my book, I\u2122ve been lucky all my life. Lu cky to get out, lucky to be able to get into England, lucky to be able to join the army, lucky to be able to get into an elite assault unit and be able to fight back. Lucky to survive that. Lucky to be able to get my book written and accepted by the first publisher. Lucky to have the movie thing, lucky to have all the other things that are happening in conjunction with it. So, that\u2122s what it ta \u0152 it takes as far as I\u2122m concerned, and look, if th e movie doesn\u2122t turn out as I would hope it would, or isn\u2122t made bef \u0152 as long as I live \u0152 I don\u2122t know how these things work \u0152 my wife Alice points out, you\u2122ve done your thing, you\u2122ve written your book. Right now there is a debate raging about \u0152 raging is perhaps an overstatement. But one of the members of my troop, who was in combat very briefly because he stepped on a mine and lost a foot in Italy, so he was out of it. He continues his law studies, became a judge in England, which isn\u2122t bad for a Jewish refugee boy from Europe, and he\u2122s now a retired judge. And he picked up the ball as it were, when my book came out and he wants us to contribute money to a monument in North Wales. And the \u0152 to my utter shock, the words on it did not include the word Jewish. So I started a sort of agitating, lobbying campaign to enlist support of ex-members of the troop or widows or families to insist that it does include the words Jewish. He \u0152 the judge went so far as to say that my saying a Jewish commandos war against the Nazis in the subtitle was a blur and a s \u0152 and the flaw in my book. And after I got over the shock and \u0152 and told him off about making such an excessive statement, I had quite the time writing him a letter saying, having been a judge I suppose Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 117you feel you must be judgmental in some direction. I am sl owly beginning to understand where this comes from, and it\u2122s very simple. First of all, this is not America, where we have just finished talking about the fact th at 50 years ago there was overt anti-Semitism. It has become unfashionable as I say \u0152 as I put it. It\u2122s, in sophisticated circles equally unfashionable in England , but there is the fear of it among Jews in Britain, apparently. I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m \u0152 and here\u2122s the thing. When we were first changing our names and becoming a different person, that was rather fun for most of us, because having been a hate object in Germany, Austria, Hungary, having been a poor refugee, as most of us were, having been in the labor unit, which was the bottom of the army, becoming an elite unit member and wearing the green beret and the parachute wings for which we had qualified, and then knowing we were risking considerable \u0152 our lives, o-our limbs, carried with it a certain satisfaction and pride. And to be a different person, I mean, I \u0152 I became ultimately, well, a commando, a commando sergeant, an officer in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, a good regiment. And I am Peter Masters and \u0152 and gone is the refugee Peter Arany, you see? Now, some of them relished that so much that they didn\u2122t want to step out of it because they felt it would be stepping back. And so, to my utter shock, one of my friends in Edinburgh where I spoke at the Church of Scotland church hall, and a classmate of mine from grade sc hool invited lots of people and arranged it so I had a very nice audience. Yet, a commando friend of mine in Scotland didn\u2122t invite anybody. And I suddenly realized that the reason he didn\u2122t invite anybody is because it would have blown his c over, now. Because he has a Scottish name. He has very little accent, much less than I do, and I suppose he can account for that by Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 118our cover story where he was aw \u0152 brought up or something. He is the president of \u0152 or was, of the local rugby club. And if \u0152 if he \u0152 if he invited people to something called, \ufb01Striking Back: A Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazis,\ufb02 and he was one of the commandos, the thought would occur to th em that he too is a Jewish commando from Europe, and he doesn\u2122t want to be. And the judge probably doesn\u2122t want to be anything except a retired judge. And that goes for qu ite a few. Now it doesn\u2122t go for everybody. The widow of my friend Harry Nomberg(ph) says who \u0152 whose name is \u0152 is Beatrice Nomberg(ph) and she is from Argentina. Catholic, and Harry\u2122s dead, died recently. And she says Harry wouldn\u2122t have wanted it any other way but that it says mostly Jewish. And the judge says that was not a prerequisite for joining the troop. It was not in the criteria that qualified you and I said, that\u2122s true. But where would they have found German speaking people who wanted to do spec ial and hazardous duty, if it had not been for refugees that were Jewish and German speaking. And he says, well, some of them were \u0152 were not Jewish. They were half Jewish or they were baptized, or they were \u0152 they didn\u2122t even know that the \u0152 part of their family was Jewish. And I said, the Nazis knew. [break]"

            "answer": "Sure. In \u0152 in 1984, I retired. It was the earliest time that I could retire, and that always brings with it certain f \u0152 financial disadvantages, but I felt it was high time for me to get a \u0152 get out of what had be come a rather difficult thing. The time of enthusiasm that we had had in the \u0152 in the poverty program was long gone. Even the transformation into wanting to take on the \u0152 the musty look of government and try and brush it up into something more contemporary and positive, that was beginning to ebb away and the fights were more frequent than \u0152 than the \u0152 the \u0152 the challenges. And there were various \u0152 I \u0152 I \u0152 that\u2122s another thing in that period of government, and that is that you can ha ve an administration, a government with which you agree politically, but the person in charge of your agency may not be at all conducive to doing any positive things in \u0152 in what I considered my field and my charge. Or reversely, you might have an administration that is unacceptable politically to you, and you have no choice until next election as it were, and then you may lose. And the \u0152 a-and yet it might be possible to do some positive things because you have somebody who is interested and who cares. Now, in the overall, Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 120in order to improve, and there have been conscious efforts of bringing good design to government, not always, what shall I sa y, enlightened efforts. But there were times when Nancy Hanks was in charge of \u0152 of the endowment, and she had a way to get around politicians that was admirable. And in \u0152 so \u0152 so there \u0152 there were times when it \u0152 when one had the fe eling that something worthwhile could be accomplished, and there were other times when it seemed utterly hopeless. Utterly hopeless. And we \u0152 I \u0152 I remember \u0152 I remember trying to get \u0152 to come up with a formula a-and saying, well \u0152 o-or \u0152 at least an analysis, a diagnosis of why things were so hopeless at times and it is because the government is made up almost entirely of lawyers. All right? Now, I have nothing against lawyers per se, but with the very specialized methodology of American education, unlike some European educations, which in my opinion emphasize general knowledge and a general sort of Renaissance view of not knowing only your subject, but also the arts and literature and music and something of a-at least basic something. This does not necessarily hold in this country. And it\u2122s perfectly possible to be a brilliant lawyer and have absolutely \u0152 if \u0152 if you were asked to name three American sculptors, they couldn\u2122t do it. Which is astonishing, you know? There have been some wonderful ones. But I me an, ap \u0152 quite apart from that, perhaps the size of the country is counterproductive to this kind of thinking because if you ask me to name an artist from every of the 50 states, I probabl y would have a very Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 121hard time, because well, because I \u0152 and \u0152 and you see, there are layers of knowledge. There are people who know a lot about a subject, there are people who know a li \u0152 a bit ab \u0152 some, and there are people who know a little and then there are people who know nothing. And it\u2122s perfec tly possible to be prominent in one field in this country and know nothing a bout the others. It\u2122s a bit shocking, but then there are many shocking things like th at, culturally. I \u0152 I \u0152 one of my favorite examples since I was in Japan a few years ago is tell me somebody who knows anything \u0152 anything about Japanese culture, who learned it in school. Thi \u0152 anything besides \ufb01 Shogun\ufb02 and \ufb01 Madame Butterfly.\ufb02 Anything about the background of an ancient culture, you see? And we don\u2122t learn it in school, I guess it\u2122s assumed. I mean, unless you\u2122re a specialist, because perhaps it\u2122s assumed that there is so much knowledge out there that you can\u2122t know it all. Computers can change that a bit now, because you can, if you\u2122re at all interested, you can look it up in the internet and it\u2122s pro \u0152 no doubt in there. And I wonder to what extent that will spread a degree o-o-of feeling, of general knowledge? Now, when \u0152 if we don\u2122t have a president one day who really cares about the arts, beyond the Kennedy Center Awards, do you think that \u0152 that the arts will flourish all by themselves a-as congress enc ourages sponsored by corporations, rather than by the endowment and so on? This is a very tricky subject, you see? It da \u0152 it \u0152 some of it isn\u2122t going to happen. And if you look ba ck, historically, whether we have had any Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 122arts in \u0152 in top positions; there\u2122s Thomas Jefferson, who was in his own right, an inventive, creative mind that I think overlapped into the arts and certainly into architecture. What he did at Monticello and at the university i-is \u0152 is admirable. Can you think of any othe r ones? You see, you \u0152 I probably don\u2122t know enough about some of the intervening ones, but \u0152 but cert ainly, I mean \u0152 okay, Rockefeller was an art collector and he was vice-president. Whether he collected \u0152 I don\u2122t know his motivations. Mondale\u2122s wife was into ceramics, all right? Jackie was into \u0152 int \u0152 into interior decoration, all right? But \u0152 but going backwards, do you think that Carter, Bush, Reagan? Well, into movies. Eisenhower, Kennedy? Blank. You see, I mean, an interest \u0152 Humphrey was very interested in photography. We did a big photo exhibits when I was in the poetry program that he prompted. And it was lovely. I took him through it and it was marvelous how perceptive he was. But you see, we are not going to elect an artist or even an art collector president, it \u0152 as it stands. And then th \u0152 and I think that it would take a strong hand to do some thing to \u0152 i-i-in fact, let me backtrack that [indecipherable]. It is marvelous that we are doing as well as we are, because the point \u0152 the center point of the arts ha s actually shifted to this country from \u0152 from Europe, from Paris to New York and perhaps Los Angeles, I don\u2122t know. Chicago. And \u0152 and we are doing amazingly we ll considering that \u0152 that what I just said holds true. And when I applied for my Fulbright you may recall, my Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 123principal, a Scots painter said they are in their Elizabethan age in the United States, artistically, culturally. Meaning the first Elizabeth , right? So, we are doing remarkably well, we could be doing much better still, with more encouragement, with less sort of redneck small town attitudes about the arts being on the border of something questionable, and sinful and not quite reputable. Which is what we are seeing every time the endowment happens to \u0152 to endorse, or not even endorse, but \u0152 but gets marginally involved with a grant that is then used for something that is appalling and shocking. And of course, that\u2122s the chance you take, to some extent. You can\u2122t pre-examine and sense everything you award, and some of them are going to misfire. So, we get some demonstrative art that\u2122s a bit beyond the pale when people shoot themselves in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in the toes in order to \u0152 yeah, there was some man who \u0152 who cons idered that demonstrative art, he actually shot holes into himself on the stage, or the othe r one kicked herself in chocolate in the nude, and so on, and this is performance art, you see, but th \u0152 there is much in art that is shocking if it is new. Some of it is bad. Well, if you want some good, there\u2122s also going to be some bad, th-the re has to be freedom. Now, perhaps one can control that a little bit, but the attempts have been made to go by local standards only. Well, there are some Noguchi sculptures in Seattle that the government, General Services Administration under its arts in \u0152 in government buildings program put in, and a local congr essman protested that these were pet Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 124rocks, because Noguchi takes a stone and works it minimally, but very, very beautifully. My judgment okay, but not only mine. And he thought that this was meaningless, and a waste. And a Sugarman sculpture in a court in Baltimore was hated by the judge and the judge rules his court like a-an autocratic ruler. And he said it was dangerous because it offered hiding places for muggers who would waylay the secretaries when they came from work in the evening. Well, I mean, these are pretty farfetched criticisms. He just didn\u2122t like that sculpture, you know. And maybe it was not a nice sculpture, I mean, a-are you going to love all sculptures equally? I heard scathing criticism of the Roosevelt Memorial. And then I \u0152 and I haven\u2122t seen it yet. And I looked at a brochure about it, and the artists who were involved, like Baskin and Segal and \u0152 and Benton , who is the carver of the letters, are top notch people. So it can\u2122t be all bad. Oh, I didn\u2122t continue that I said \u0152 well, in \u212284, in \u212284 I retired and I took my early retirement and \u0152 and made a rousing fa rewell speech where I told them all what was wrong with government and with the General Services min \u0152 Ad ministration in particular and it made people blanch, but I really loved the opportunity to use the commando spirit and \u0152 in at least telling them how it was, which was pretty much off the rails by that time and I was glad to \u0152 to get ou t.

            "answer": "Paula Ammon(ph) wrote an article in the B\u2122nai B\u2122rith monthly magazine called what, \ufb01Jewish Monthly ,\ufb02 I think? And it\u2122s an international magazine. And they sent a photographer out whose \u0152 whos e name I\u2122d have to look up, but he is brilliant, because he actually took a picture of me that I like, and that\u2122s hard to do. He took a lot of pictures and they us ed one, and it shows that even as a septuagenarian first time au thor, you don\u2122t have to look like a decrepit old man. He \u0152 and she wrote a very nice article. There were a couple of errors. One she didn\u2122t do herself, because somebody else writes the table of content at the front of the magazine. And in that table of conten t, they \u0152 this person wrote that I had served in Normandy and Salerno. And I was nowhere near Salerno. But some of our people were. My friend Stefan(ph) Rosskum(ph) who served as Steve Ross Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 126was in Salerno and I think the judge who is now retired, with whom I am debating the inscription on the monument was in Salerno, and \u0152 and they were in Anzio and in Salerno, and then in the river crossings in the Italian campaign, the Carilliano(ph), the Isonzo and so on, before we landed on D-Day. But I was not in Salerno. Secondly, the second mistake is much worse, it says that when I went to art school in London after my military service, I wanted to get into the Central School of Art and Design , because I had heard that it will \u0152 because it was so anti-Semitic that it was hard to get in. That is totally untrue. She got that fir-first because I \u0152 I said that I had been told it was a very competitive school and it was hard to get in, not a word of anti-Semitism is true. I made up my mind that I would get into the school because it was competitive and it was going to be difficult to get accepted. I felt that I had perhaps an unfair advantage because I was still in uniform, and if you come to apply to a school after six years of war in a commando uniform with parachute wings an d your medal ribbons, the chances are they\u2122re gonna let you in if your work isn\u2122t terribly bad, I guess my work was not that terribly bad, although I remember sitting in a life class and the very prominent painter who taught that life class looked over my shoulder and said, how many times a week are you taking life class? And I said, three times a week. And he said, make that five. A sobering experience. So, and it says then, with \u0152 with typical chutzpah I became president of the students union. Well, the person who Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 127told me it was hard to get into the sc hool in the first place was a young woman who had just graduated, and she boasted th at she had been president of the student union, she was a refugee. And so I decide d that I would get into the school and become president of the student union, and I did. So that was not with typical chutzpah, but I said, with the drive of an ex-commando, I dis \u0152 I became president of the student union."

If you would take a moment and reflect on \u0152 on the birth of the state of Israel. You\u2122ve talked about that before, but things since the birth of Israel, the Eichmann trial, and Israel\u2122s wars. As a refugee now living in this country, how have those events impacted you?",
            "answer": "Well, I\u2122m \u0152 I\u2122m not sure I told you the story that after the war, there were annual memorial services at Westminster, and when people came out of the \u0152 I\u2122m not sure if it\u2122s Westminster Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, because I think I\u2122ve been to one. I\u2122m told there were people recruiting. I da \u0152 I told you that story, that they were recruiting for the \u0152 for the Arabs and \u0152 and for the Israelis because they wanted train the sol \u0152 soldiers. Well, the Israeli \u0152 the Israeli military effort appeared to me to be a continuation of th is thing that I was about, the \u0152 the striking Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 128back mentality. And if anything, they underscored what I was trying to demonstrate, because when I was a high school kid in Vienna, the notion that Jews would fight meaningful, strategic \u0152 no, meaningful military assault actions seemed very farfetched. The pictures the Nazi tried to create was that Jews were persons that sought desk jobs in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 or \u0152 and were ove r intellectualized and physically incapable of any actions such as the one required in \u0152 such actions as the Israelis demonstrated they were extremely capable of doing, and we too, in our way, demonstrated that we were able to do that sort of thing and do it well. It hadn't really occurred to the world, an d I find that \u0152 that Jews could do an Entebbe raid, or fight off a vast armored superiority with mainly the spirit and \u0152 and enthusiasm and ingenuity of a dedicate d people. So all this was very important to me, and it had not really \u0152 well, i-it was novel, and it was bright and shiny. And I think it was wonderful that these things \u0152 that \u0152 that \u0152 that we were gathering respect. At times I was appalled at the attempted turnaround of making that this was comparable to the militarists on the enemy\u2122s side. In other words that mean-spirited critics would say that the Israeli actions were Nazism in the Middle East. I think that that is a partisan point of view, that I-I find very hard to stomach. And again, I have friends who are much more knowledgeable about the details of some of these Israeli actions, and who when criticized for the politics, which of course is \u0152 is \u0152 is a \u0152 a \u0152 a popular pastime anyw ay, point out the geog raphy. And I\u2122ve been Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 129to Israel once, and I stood on the Golan Heights, and I \u0152 I said, if it were mine, I wouldn\u2122t give it up, because it means that they can do \u0152 aim shooting into the kibbutz on the other slope, and I obviously would have to prevent that from happening. Much of this is outdated now because if the warfare is by rocket and missile, it doesn\u2122t matter whether you do observed shooting or not. Nevertheless, the narrow waist of Israel is so \u0152 is so narrow that you find that to give up territory that would make it narrower still, is not the kind of thing you want to do easily and without some guarantees that are meaningful."

            "answer": "About Jewish resistance I\u2122ve had some lively de-debates, mo stly by letter with the Holocaust Museum people, because I feel that we who, as refugees, volunteered for special and hazardous duty and put our lives on the line, that this is unlike somebody joining the armed forces an d serving at the Pentagon. It seems to m \u0152 especially if you judge it by its ultimate results. It\u2122s true that people were killed in all kinds of units here and there, but many of us were killed. Twenty of 86 were killed. And almost all were wounded and some of the wounds were by no means minor, a lost eye, a lost leg, th ings from which they subsequently, years later, became invalids and died. I \u0152 I think the fact that a \u0152 a refugee who is, by Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 130definition a person who escaped, who \u0152 who either went into hiding and escaped or managed to escape when it was still possible to do so without pretense, usually penniless, did not sit back and say, we\u2122ve suffered enough and let somebody else do it, but volunteered and volunteered and volunteered and overcame all the difficulties that it took me and my friends to be allowed to volunteer for risky things. I say we are resistance, and they say this \u0152 by resistance we define the people in the forests of Vilna, or the people who, in the Warsaw uprising, and I certainly agree that they were resistance, and I would define it by saying they were resistance of desperation, because if you are in their situation in the Warsaw ghetto, if you are in their situation hiding in the forests and trying to \u0152 to do damage to the enemy, y-yyou \u0152 you ar \u0152 this is a \u0152 a desperation move. If you questioned and interviewed them as I am being interviewed now, they would say, the ideal thing for us would have been to ge t out if we could, if only we could. To get equipped and trained, tr ained and equipped, and then to come back with the maximum effectiveness of the well-trained, well-equipped person. I don\u2122t really want to quibble about this indefinitely, because if they don\u2122t call us resistance, okay. I think we were resistance, that\u2122s all. I think we did what we could to resist and \u0152 and were willing to take risks and volunteer and volunteer and volunteer. And volunteer on top of volunteering for special assignments. So that gave us immense satisfaction, insofar as we survived it, and I would say even insofar as we Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 131didn\u2122t, it was a comforting thought to those who lay dying that they had done it in luc \u0152 that they were there because they wanted to be."

You mentioned what you called reaction beyond reflex, and you talked about knowing that sometimes a person needs to take action. I was wondering if you could expand on that, since this is a follow-up to that interview.",
            "answer": "I \u0152 I\u2122m not \u0152 I\u2122m not sure there is very much to expand, but it works like this, and it\u2122s a wartime thing. You have a feeling, at times, in \u0152 in situations that might be desperate or \u0152 or dangerous, or what ever, that somebody has to take some action that is required to resolve the situation. And you have the fi \u0152 th \u0152 and the follow-up feeling of that feeling is, in my experience, that you find \u0152 and if I don\u2122t, perhaps nobody will take the necessary action. That therefore you \u0152 you \u0152 you realize \u0152 and this doesn\u2122t \u0152 isn\u2122t a lengthy process, you suddenly realize somebody must do something and must do it now and nobody seems to be doing it, so I better. So you do it. And you do it swiftly and with determination and you have decided to do it and so you do it. And this is true in a great many things and has its application by an extension to \u0152 to non-wartime situations where the feeling is, somebody must do something, and \u0152 an d \u0152 and what \u0152 what \u0152 what can I do? And i-i \u0152 perhaps it\u2122s entirely up to me. Sometimes with some of my best Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 132commando friends, I found that as I was thinking somebody must do something, they were already doing it, because they had a similar mindset. But not everybody does, and I think that to \u0152 to take a long bridge to some of our political problems at the moment, I heard somebody ask not long a go, where is the person who is taking the kind of action that was taken by an Ed Murrow in the McCarthy situation, by speaking out with authority and saying , this has to stop. Or a \u0152 a \u0152 a \u0152 Welsh in the McCarthy hearings when he said, sir, have you no shame, to Senator McCarthy. I feel that the speaking out, and s \u0152 I mean, surely an authority def \u0152 an authority figure should stand up and sa y, enough already. Surely. I understand what this is all about, I understand that \u0152 that \u0152 and I have my own partisan view of it, wh-which \u0152 which is irrelevant. I-It seems to me that it ought to be possible to rise about the partisan thing when the damage done to our daily lives, the \u0152 the mere fatigue of \u0152 of listening to the on going argument about the various options of, and what disasters each one of them will bring upon us, surely gets you to f \u0152 a point where you say, enough already.

            "question": "\u0152 in the 60s, and you were in the White House with Kennedy , and today.",
            "answer": "Well, when Kennedy was in the White House, I heard from inside people who had worked there, I think the f \u0152 the thing was that \u0152 the phrase, if I remember it rightly was a man telling me, well you kn ow he has this thing about airline stewardesses. And I thought \u0152 I \u0152 I had no idea what you were talking about and Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 134then they spelled it out to me about the swimming pool adventures of Kennedy. And you see, that \u0152 at that time, this sort of thing was going on, but traditionally not talked about except in \u0152 in \u0152 in stage whispers, and entirely separate from all other considerations. Now, I-I can see how any moralist person would object to the details of \u0152 of \u0152 of the sexual adventures of the present president. I \u0152 I \u0152 I think that it is of course true, that if I described you \u0152 to you any sexual activity by anybody in detail, it would sound shocking, simply beca use we are not used to seeing this sort of thing in print, except \u0152 I mean, the beginning \u0152 le-let me backtrack there. When D.H. Lawrence wrote \u0152 wrote \ufb01Lady Chatterley\u2122s Lover\ufb02 where he first called \u0152 u-used the expressive language for a sexual activity, that was banned and considered shocking. It was the first time it had really happened by a major author. James Joyce describes oral sex in considerable detail. The sug \u0152 but it\u2122s not customary in the average novel or \u0152 or history to go into detailed descriptions, largely because the hint of Hollywood before overt sex on the screen, the hint is more powerful than the spelling out. It has more \u0152 more \u0152 i-i-it\u2122s in \u0152 it\u2122s more tasteful, it\u2122s \u0152 it-it\u2122s more genteel. That caused some authors to go deliberately the other way and write it very bluntly. Miller, not Arthur, but th \u0152 \ufb01Tropic of Cancer,\ufb02 if you recall, made it very, very \u0152 spelled out sex references. Personally I\u2122m not shocked by anything, I think it\u2122s in pretty poor taste. And the best criticism I have fo und, the one that strikes me the most Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 135meaningful is the one that a president shoul \u0152 knowing that in today\u2122s scenario this will come back at him and be publicized all over the place, takes what is a \u0152 a very reckless risk in \u0152 in doing it. And \u0152 and that is, to me, the main criticism. The fact that he did it doesn\u2122t interest me at a ll. People do all kinds of things, some are more kinky than others. But you see, ther e is another current in the present thing and that is, to many patriotic and religious Americans, the Oval Office is somewhat comparable to the holiest of holy in the temple, and \u0152 before its destruction. And so, if anything happened \u0152 like that happens in the Oval Office, which was presumably the ambition of this young woman, so that she would have her place in history, sh-she \u0152 th-the thing is that this is in and of itself appalling, because it was \u0152 it desecrated the holiest of holy in the temple of the White House."

Now, we get multiple speculation. One of my pet aversions at the moment, by the way, is the talking Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 136heads, when \u0152 and \u0152 and the only credit you have to explain who they are, is a former prosecutor. It\u2122s a favorite choice. There are lots of former prosecutors, of all \u0152 of all shades, you see? Now, I think \u0152 and I\u2122ve seriously considered to \u0152 to try and communicate that wish to the media, they ought to be compelled to say \u0152 to give a \u0152 an extra s \u0152 a \u0152 a-a subtitle under former prosecutor and saying, a former prosecutor, a political appointee appointed by Richard Nixon , for instance. Because then you would understand \u0152 I mean, I understand where they come from by what they say anyway, but I think there are lots of people out there who say ah, a former prosecutor. Must be a legally well-informed person, you see. And some of them were shallow political appointees, ultra-partisan appointees and the least you could do is say, who put them there to be a former prosecutor, so that we \u0152 everybody can understand th \u0152 and anticipate what they are going to say. Now, if what they are going to say is a partisan line, that they tell you. And then they\u2122ll say \u0152 they\u2122ll anticipate what might be done to counteract that. And they will say, the f \u0152 the following options, and so wa \u0152 in any case they will exhaust and dismantle any option before it has even been dr eamt of by anybody. And now there is nothing new you are going to hear, but you are going to hear again and again and again that this was a minor burglary, and th is is not a case of sex, but a case of profound obstruction of justi ce. And to \u0152 to me, I would even suggest that all these lawyers get together and say that perjury in cases of denying sexual activity should Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 137be discounted as ca \u0152 as perjury. Becau se, it\u2122s an automatic reflex. If you ask somebody \u0152 it\u2122s like the question, when did you last beat your wife? It\u2122s a question, when did you last have an ex tramarital affair? Gee, I never had an extramarital affair, okay?
