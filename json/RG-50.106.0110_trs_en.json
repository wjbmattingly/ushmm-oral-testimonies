            "question": "What languages?",
            "answer": "What languages. Well, I was born w \u2014 my \u2014 my original language was the Austrian version of German, which incidentally has always been a little bone of contention between Germans and Austrians. Austrians feel that the only correct and proper German is spoken in Austria, and different parts of Germany make the same claim. Hamburg, for instance, han \u2014 Hannover, they think that\u2019s \u2014 they also think that the claims by the others are absurd, and \u2014 and funny. I learnt a little French as a small child, we had a French teacher, a Madame come to the apartment and \u2014 and purportedly teach us French, my sister and myself. It didn\u2019t really work, didn\u2019t go much beyond \u201cFr\u00e9re Jacques.\u201d And we didn\u2019t really like her; that didn\u2019t help. And \u2014 however, when \u2014 in my school system, we took a fir \u2014 a foreign language from the age of 11, and I chose French. The teacher who taught French also taught German and was the fore-master of my class. So he was the administrative, disciplinary head of that class. And he wa \u2014 turned out to be one of the well known arch-Nazis of Vienna. A published author, who when the Austrian Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters \u00b0 August 7, 1998 writers club, the Pen Club, the International Pen Club, Austrian branch sent a telegram to their Jewish colleagues in Germany to express their sympathy upon their book burning and treatment, there were two Austrian authors who refused to sign the otherwise unanimous declaration, and he was one of them. I got barely passing grades in German, which was my best subject, and I switched to the English class because of him. Solely because of him. So I had four years of high school English and I thought I spoke fluent English. That was disillusioned fairly quickly upon arrival in England, but I could get by fairly well. I learned a little Spanish before I left. This was really emigration learning other things type of thing. But I don\u2019t think there was enough of it to have any impact."

            "question": "Where were you on V-E day, when victory was declared in Europe?",
            "answer": "Victory in Europe. I\u2019m trying to think. The \u2014 the \u2014 strangely perhaps, the impact was not enormous on us because we had felt pretty solidly that we had won, so the \u2014 the fact of the \u2014 of it becoming official was relatively minor. The date, if I recall, was May \u2014 May eight, May eight. At May eight, I believe I was in cadet school in England, and there was a little bit of razzmatazz of people celebrating, cheering, what have you. And it \u2014 I think many of the cadets thought that now they were more likely to go to the Orient than before. And that concerned me only marginally because I thought the British would surely send me somewhere where my fluent German would make sense. I \u2014 I made some halfhearted efforts to get sent to Interview with Peter Masters \u00b0 August 7, 1998 Austria because that would have interested me, and besides, being to Germany for the first time ever, during the fighting, and I had a distaste for going to Germany. Some of our people were there and sort of lived it up in occupation, but didn\u2019t attract me. The \u2014 the \u2014 the problem as to \u2014 who was and who wasn\u2019t a Nazi and so on had already come up when \u2014 when we were fighting in Germany. And I was told that chances of getting to Austria were minimal because they were being supplied from central Mediterranean forces, meaning from Italy, whereas Germany was being supplied by personnel from northwest Europe, from \u2014 from our end. Th-The \u2014 the army has its own ways and when it came up, where I did go was West Africa."

            "question": "Before I have you going to West Africa, can you tell me, in May of 1945, what was your rank, and what \u2014 what action had you seen during the war.",
            "answer": "St-Starting at the beginning, when I was in the Pioneer corps, I was a private and I saw no chance of ever getting promoted to anything, because I was just one of the younger lads who was unloading trains or testing bridging material and so on. And I \u2014I wasn't one of the boot polisher and button polishers, so I \u2014 I wasn't a standout to the people on the parade ground by any means. In-In fact, I was a bit of a nonconformist [indecipherable]. I was more likely to get in trouble about something than I was to get promoted. So, when I came to the commandos, just prior to D-Day, I was made a lance corporal, which was a big deal. It \u2014 it\u2019s nothing Interview with Peter Masters \u2018 August 7, 1998 really, but as such I was the second in command of my detachment, a five man team, attached to number six commando, we were number 10 commando at- attaching teams to eight different commandos for D-Day. So, I was a lance corporal and was subsequently promoted to be a corporal in the field, which caused a little argument because I said to my colleague and sergeant, who said, I\u2019m making you a corporal and I said, you know, jokingly, want me to stitch on an extra stripe here in \u2014 in the front line? And he said, you\u2019re damn right. And I said I\u2014 you \u2014 you mean you have the authority to make me a paid corporal? And he said, who said anything about paid? And I came back as a corporal, largely because one of our detachments had been wiped out and I became a one man detachment. When I came back I was promoted to sergeant and when we went out to Holland and Germany again, I was a sergeant. And it was then that one of our own, who had been \u2014 who \u2014 who had become the commanding officer of our detachments, Kurt Gowza(ph) who served under the name of James Griffith, wanted to send me to cadet school. And I said, at this stage, it\u2019s late in the war, do you think it\u2019s worthwhile? And I don\u2019t want to do the parade square bashing and \u2014 and \u2014 and pamphlet bullshitting, I just don\u2019t want to do it. And he persuaded me to do it, with the help of the brigade major, Sir Maxwell Hopagow(ph). He \u2014 they \u2014 they li \u2014 I wanted to talk to the brigadier, if \u2014 if \u2014 if a commission then happened in the field, Montgomery was against commissions in the field unless from dire need, casualties, because he said it leads Interview with Peter Masters \u00b0 August 7, 1998 to fraternization through the enlisted men. Which we thought was just fine, and he apparently as a [indecipherable] thought was in \u2014 improper. This is sort of regular army smokiness, you know, and \u2014 and he s \u2014 he stopped quite \u2014 quite a few of us got commissions 1n the field because they were doing a good job. And I \u2014 I fairly likely m-might have gotten one, but when I was transferred from one unit to the other, I had to start from square one to build my reputation of being keen and determined and willing to do anything and so on. Which I did. And it led to the 1 \u2014 the notion of going to cadet school. I went to cadet school, and I must say I had a ball. The fact that I\u2014 I m \u2014 I remember arriving and there were a whole bunch of youngsters out of \u2014 out of school who were going to cadet school and they were studying pamphlets. And they ask questions from the pamphlets and I had no idea what th-the answers were, b-but I said, I don\u2019t know the name of the plunger of the \u2014 this weapon, but we had a rather specialized version of that weapon for a special operation. Then suddenly everybody is listening and they want to know. Well, when it came to the tests, the same thing happened. Some \u2014 some weapon sergeant would ask questions and say, ask me about the Sten gun. I said, Sten gun was not a commando weapon, we used Thompsons, which are a higher quality. And the only Sten gun I\u2019ve ever seen was one \u2014 a special one for an operation with a silencer. He said, a\u2014 a Sten with a silencer? I\u2019ve never seen one. Tell me about it. I said, P' draw you a picture. And we talked about the Sten with the silencer for the rest of Interview with Peter Masters \u201d August 7, 1998 the examination. He said, I assume you were a weapons instructor. I said, I\u2019m not supposed to comment. You abandon your rank when you are a \u2014 a cadet. But some lance corporal who was \u2014 had the job of taking the stripes off, relished to take a sergeants stripes off, you see, so he had slashed the sleeve of my best uniform and there were cuts where my stripes had been. And the weapon instructor sergeant who was doing the testing assumed \u2014 he could see I\u2019d been a sergeant by \u2014 by the cuts on my arm. Well, I \u2014 I breezed through this whole thing like nobody\u2019s business and then \u2014 then came to cadet school, and there I was quite determined to be a nonconformist and a rebel when nonsense was being talked about, you know, pamphlet stuff, and \u2014 which often is \u2014 is outdated and \u2014 and \u2014 and has been written, who knows for whom, and \u2014 and I would \u2014 I would say \u2014 well, for instance a question. What use is the Bren gun carrier? Hands go up and the cadets \u2014 the cadet kept asking questions, you see. And they said, to carry out flanking attacks, and somebody else said something else, and when it was my turn, I said none. The Bren gun carrier is no use. I have seen more burnt out Bren gun carriers than \u2014 than non- burned out Bren gun carriers. It\u2019s a little [indecipherable] not enough armament. And I said, it is useful possibly for two things, which is to bring up the tea after battle, or if you have nothing and want to fake like you have armor, you run them off somewhere where nobody can see them and the enemy will think you\u2019re coming with a lot of tanks, because they make such a racket that they inevitably get shot at Interview with Peter Masters \" August 7, 1998 and \u2014 and \u2014 and then that\u2019s when they burn. And the instructor said, th-that Masters is absolutely right, because he had just come back from Italy himself, so he knew what I am saying is true, you see? So \u2014 so after awhile I found out wasn\u2019t that much \u2014I mean, I wa \u2014 it wasn\u2019t working the way I had thought. I \u2014 I thought I'd be a rebel and I found the management agreed with me. Which was in a way, of course, a big help and gratifying and so I graduated very high in my class, and that\u2019s the end of that one. Tha \u2014 you asked me what rank I was when I graduated. I was, of course, a second lieutenant and was subsequently promoted during my service in Africa, aut \u2014 almost automatically to first lieutenant and then my time was up. Six years. It was age plus length of service in the British army. So my number was up and I \u2014 somebody wanted me to stay as an instructor at the school of infantry and I said thank you but no thank you. Why not? Well, I said, In \u2014I-\u2014I-\u2014TI relish the illusion of freedom, that I can go wherever I want, whenever I want and not be sent. I\u2019ve been sent for a number of years now. So even bef \u2014 realizing it\u2019s an illusion, enough."

And then they \u2014 th-the \u2014 the people in charge always Interview with Peter Masters \" August 7, 1998 stretched what was an initial assault way beyond our normal role, because we didn't have heavy support weapons, you know. But they had us, so they kept us. And if you didn\u2019t happen \u2014 well, it \u2014 it just so happened that no concentrat-tration camp was in the path of where they wanted a \u2014 a-a-a \u2014 an assault made. These were usually river crossings that they used us for, after the \u2014 the initial landings at \u2014 on D-Day or in Italy or in Sicily or in Holland. So, one of our people of course, as you know, heard his parents might be alive in Terezin and went to \u2014 to go \u2014 go get them, and succeeded. That was extremely gratifying.

We knew that my \u2014 my \u2014 my grandfather was murdered in Auschwitz and we knew that were a number of distant relatives had \u2014 had \u2014 had perished. And other than looking for individual friends here and there, and \u2014 and fi \u2014 si\u2014later finding some, not very much finding materialized. There were things like getting in touch again with people who had gone to Israel. Friends. Getting in touch Interview with Peter Masters \" August 7, 1998 again with such people as my kinderfraulein, my nanny in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 who had been in Austria throughout the war. In fact, we invited her to come and visit in London, and that was very exciting. So, not much in the way of \u2014 of finding people that had \u2014 that had disappeared. There were some weird things. My \u2014 my mother lived in an apartment in London and once went to a neighbor to borrow some wrapping paper for a package she had to make in a hurry. And the woman said, well, I have this one, you can turn it over, it\u2019s used. And on the reverse side were names and addresses of my father\u2019s nephew \u2014 two of my father\u2019s nephews in New York. Since my parents were divorced, my mother never pursued that. And I tried much later to see what I could find it, found some people by this un \u2014 very unusual name in \u2014 in the telephone directory and called them up and they said, it\u2019s just a name we call our firm, and there\u2019s no one here by that name. But, it went off into the sand, nothing happened. Of course, you know, people still appear nowadays here and there, and that could theoretically happen. My \u2014 I \u2014 \u2019m-\u2014I\u2019m still looking for some of my classmates and when I came to Europe I used to read the telephone books wherever I was, to see what I could find. And sometimes I\u2019d find a name and sometimes I\u2019d pursue it and call up for some classmate or other, and not find them at home, or in the country or something. And it never really led anywhere. If I came back a few years later and looked in the phone book again, maybe a name was missing and I assumed the person died, or moved. So it \u2014 not \u2014 not \u2014 not very much.

So you \u2014 you find that \u2014 that some of this is \u2014 is quite \u2014 quite hopeless. When I was in London just now, a friend of mine whom I haven\u2019t seen since 1940-something, actually came from Munich to spend the day with me and we talked all day long about the old times. He was especially good friend. I would never have \u2014 I would never have recognized him in \u2014 in the street, or [indecipherable].

            "question": "Before I ask you about your service in Africa, which I will do in a minute, I wanted to ask you, when did you realize the full extent of the genocide in Europe?",
            "answer": "This is a question I \u2014 that 1s very difficult, and I have asked myself that, because no \u2014 many atime still, it\u2019s very, very hard to answer, because the fact that people were being killed became known almost immediately. And by that I mean the anschluss was in 12\" of March 1938. At that time people were arbitrarily arrested. The brutality in Austria was much more immediate than the gradual tightening of the noose in Germany. Which of course was a good thing, except if it happened to you. A good thing in that it scared you into action, which it didn\u2019t do for many people in Germany, because it just got a little worse all the time. Well, in Austria Interview with Peter Masters \" August 7, 1998 the brutality was immediate and many people said, let\u2019s get out of here and \u2014 a \u2014 or, any border, quick. And not enough people said that and \u2014 and \u2014 but \u2014 but those who did benefited from that scenario. Oh, people were arrested and in the beginning one asked naively, why were they arrested. And then there were some black humor jests. They were arrested because they had eggs for breakfast. You know, the people were still joking about this sort of thing. And then some of these neighbors or friends who had been arrested, actually were released. And some of them were in very poor condition, having been beaten and goodness knows what. So [indecipherable] became aware that people were being tortured or beaten. And then in some cases one heard that the family received an urn with ashes, saying, shot while trying to escape. Well, shot while trying to escape. If this was some very peaceable neighbor, you know \u2014 knew them well, that this was not a man who was going to escape from \u2014 from benevolent detention. So there began to materialize a certain awe of, are they coming for me, if they\u2019re coming for me, what will happen to me? Are they coming for my relatives? Should one work more actively on getting out, and \u2014 and so on. And this is \u2014 was a gradually increasing image, and I have a memory. I haven\u2019t researched this, but I have a memory that there \u2014 I went to the movies once in England, and there was a movie \u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 there was a group, you know, like the Stoogies, called The Crazy Gang. Funny people in \u2014 you know, in \u2014 in \u2014 movie comedians. And the thing was called, The Crazy Gang ina Interview with Peter Masters : August 7, 1998 Concentration Camp. Now, that\u2019s appalling, isn\u2019t it? I mean, I \u2014 I \u2014 I suppose in a way some of this Stalag 17 series became from a serious film into a TV series that was humorous. It was a comical German and y-y-you remember that thing? Well, The Crazy Gang in the Concentration Camp. One should really try and fish that out and look at it and see how \u2014 how appalling it \u2014 it might well be. But it shows you the scenario that some people who were aware of the fact that there are concentration camps thought it was a subject matter for a comical film. Now [indecipherable] seen from this end of \u2014 of \u2014 of history or time. So, what I\u2019m using it for here 1s to illustrate the unawareness of some, how real and how serious it was, and yet the awareness of others, but \u2014 but shout it in an ominous [indecipherable] of \u2014 of nothing, behind which you could not look. And that built and built and built and built until 1t became a fu-full awareness. When, I cannot put a date on that. Then there \u2014 there were stories, and I don\u2019t remember any more whether we heard them then or later, of the man who tried to make \u2014 make the \u2014 the \u2014 the British awa \u2014 government aware \u2014 or first of all, tried to make his Jewish neighborhoods in Poland aware and went from village to village saying, Juden es brennt.

So there was a shipload of \u2014 of young officers who were to go to Africa, amusingly, on a ship called the Jan Sobieski.

Well, the \u2014 the \u2014 that \u2014 th-there in \u2014 in the \u2014 1n the lounge was this great big portrait of Jan Sobieski and I was the only passenger on that ship who knew who it was. We went to Africa and the purpose to send us was to train native troops as aid to civil power. Because the British had not yet decided to relinquish the empire. And in case they decided to hang onto the empire, they needed military support, ideally from the local population, hopefully. Well, we didn\u2019t ever say that. What we were doing 1s we were training native troops to wipe out remaining pockets of Japanese resistance in remote parts of the world. You know, there were Japanese soldiers who were holed up on some Pacific island, I mean, Oriental \u2014 in the Aleutian islands, wherever, and who either hadn\u2019t heard that they had surrendered 20 years previously, or \u2014 well, at that time not 20 years. And every now and again one of them would come out. Well, we were training our people to \u2014 our \u2014 our native Ghanaians -- before there was a Ghana [indecipherable] to wipe out these pockets of fanatic resistance. But what we were really doing 1s training them, you see, to civil power. And I was greatly helped by my attitude, I really liked them. And they really liked me. They had nicknames for everybody. I was called lieutenant aero-plane driver. That was because I wore parachute wings, which \u2014 for which I had qualified, and they saw wings and they though wings must be an aero- plane, and what do you do with an aero-plane? You drive it. So I was lieutenant aero-plane driver. And I talked to them, which many did not. And found it most Interview with Peter Masters \" August 7, 1998 instructive, the different philosophy, just beginning to be materialistic, but by and large, not materialistic. No work ethic. Now, you have to picture that. We are so steeped into our work ethic that we say, if you are industrious you will be rewarded. They say, do-do \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t make work. If things grow by themselves, then sow them and then go and harvest them, but you don\u2019t have to work in between."

[break] \u2014 uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape one, side B. Okay, we\u2019re back and you were telling me about your experiences in Africa and you were talking about the work ethic.",
            "answer": "Yes, well, the \u2014 the Africans were really just beginning in \u2014 1-1n that area. I mean, the present \u2014 the Africans would resent my saying some of these things because they want to be contemporary, modern people. And that\u2019s fine, although one can\u2019t help but deplore losing certain things. For instance, the most important thing to the men was to talk. They would sit under a shady tree and talk and talk and talk. And that was not something that you would say they are lazy and good for nothing. No, they were doing an important thing, they were talking. It\u2019s true that \u2014 that that meant more work for the women, but the tradition of that, I guess is so ancient that it \u2014 it isn\u2019t a thing where you had the feeling that there\u2019s going to be a feminist movement saying let the women sit and talk, let the men carry the logs.

I can give you some sample conversations that are favorites of mine. That the European or American countries is showing off too, what they can perceive to be a primitive culture. And so you show them a picture of the Golden Gate bridge. And they say mm, fine bridge. And then comes a little noise, that you learn to hear. It is ah. It\u2019s just a little doubt in the admiration. And they say, this bridge, fine bridge. What 1s it for? A very basic question. You say well, it\u2019s so people, obviously, can get from one side to the other. Ah, of course. Ah, why do the people from one side want to go on the other side? Well, some people work on one side and live on the other. Ah, ah yeah. There\u2019s no work on the other side. I said, yes, there \u2014 there is work on the other side, but some of them \u2014 and so it goes. And then I say, well, you\u2019re giving me a hard time because obviously they are leading me on, you see. You build bridges, you have bridges for \u2014 so, I mean, this is just a\u2014a bigger bridge. Yeah, fine bridge. Ah, how long it take to build this bridge? How much did it cost? Well, they have you, you know, I mean th-the \u2014 then \u2014 you now would have to demonstrate that it is economically worthwhile to build all our bridges and that it pays, and \u2014 and \u2014 and that it\u2019s \u2014 makes more sense than \u2014 and so on and so on and so on and so on. And this goes on and now I offer you \u2014 imagine what happened when one of the young officers committed suicide. British officers. Far away from home for the first time, unhappy, hot climate, who knows? I was the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 mentor because I was the one they \u2014 that talked to them. So the natives gathered around me and said, why? And I said, he had \u2014 he was lonely, he had few friends. You\u2019re not his friend? I said yes, I tried to be his friend, but he was unapproachable, I couldn\u2019t get to him. How is he better now than he was when he was lonely? I\u2019m getting into theology here or whatever, you see, I mean I\u2014 so I say \u2014 I counterattack. I said, there\u2019s nobody ever committed suicide here, your people? That caused a huddle and a long discussion and then they came back and said, maybe two people \u2014 no, maybe one lot of people, and then another person. And I said, when you mean \u2014 when \u2014 when you say a lot of people \u2014 well, long time ago, the story, king died. King had 40 wives. Wives were singing pious songs and walked into a swamp, to accompany the soul of dead king. Don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true. Is that suicide? I said, well, I suppose so, I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s the other one? There was this crazy woman, and some people say she jumped into a well, deep well, died. Some people say somebody pushed her into the well. Some people say she fell into the well. But some people say jumped into the well. That\u2019s the only one we can think of. And I said, well what does a person do who 1s very unhappy? You ca \u2014 you can\u2019t tell me everybody\u2019s happy all the time. Oh, he go for bush. That means into the jungle. Maybe drink some palm wine. Go to sleep. Wake up, everything fine. Not bad. You see? So \u2014 so \u2014 so Pm \u2014 I\u2019m -\u2014I\u2019m literally learning in many ways, because we are so assuming that in our self righteousness that what we Interview with Peter Masters \" August 7, 1998 do is absolutely the only way, and in a way it explains that when \u2014 when \u2014 when slavery used some of these very places as a source, and transposed forcibly people who did not have a work ethic and suddenly told them they had to work God knows what hours, that it was very tempting to say they are good for nothing and lazy. And they were not good for nothing and lazy, we were stupid. And now all over the world everybody\u2019s sins are coming home to roost. The British empire has fallen apart and they are all coming to Britain and \u2014 and they used to sneer at the United States for having racial problems, and they\u2019ve been relatively quiet recently.

            "answer": "Well, in a word yes. Not-Not \u2014 not \u2014 not that specifically. I had a\u2014as a specialist, and a \u2014 a fluent German speaker trained in the German armed forces, my last attachment was with all Marine commandoes and the colonel, who was a great soldier, was quite fond of me and after the war we had a drink at the Army-Navy club in London. He introduced me to some retired Marine general and \u2014 who \u2014 who told me how fortunate I was that I had the honor and privilege to serve with Marines \u2014 Marine commandos. And the colonel a-asked, what are you doing now? And I said, I\u2019m going to art school, because I \u2014 that\u2019s was \u2014 I was going to be a di \u2014 Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 graphic designer. And he said, lord bless my soul, whatever for? And I said, I want to be a graphic designer. He said, well, if you are stuck for anything \u2014 for something to do, I am taking up my post as inspector general of the Palestine police, and I \u2014 there\u2019Il always be a job for you. I said, thank you very much sir. And my mother had mentioned that to a visiting friend from Israel, my th \u2014 as a son of my grandfather\u2019s partner. And he said \u2014 she \u2014 she \u2014 she mentioned the colonel first of all, before all this took place. And he said he won\u2019t live long. And I said \u2014 my mother said, good heavens, why? And he said, well we have very \u2014 engaged in a war to shake British domination of \u2014 of \u2014 of what is promised us under the Balfour Declaration. And sh \u2014 if he is in charge of the Palestine police then 1-is \u2014 there is something very close to total war between us. And so a few days later this conversation I had at the Army-Navy club was reported to him and he said, he should take it. And my mother was outraged, she said, you just said that the man he\u2019d be working with isn\u2019t \u2014 may not live long and now you want my son to be in that position? And he said, it might be very useful to have somebody in there. And my mother said, but you said it\u2019s very dangerous. And he said, dane \u2014 what\u2019s dangerous? Walks across Piccadilly and a tile falls off a roof and kill you. That\u2019s dangerous. But Mother was not convinced, and \u2014 and 1-1-1t didn\u2019t happen. Now, it\u2019s also true that there were services annually, memorial services, what have you, in Westminster Abbey and so on. And my \u2014 some of my fr \u2014I didn't attend any, Interview with Peter Masters \u201c August 7, 1998 maybe one, I can\u2019t remember. And a\u2014 some of my friends told me they went to it and as they came out there were people on either side of the entrance saying psst, come here, I want to talk to you. And apparently they were recruiting. The \u2014 the Israelis were recruiting, that is the \u2014 the Irgun, or whoever, or the Stern gang, or I \u2014I don\u2019t know. And on the other side the Arabs were recruiting, because they were recruiting for the Arab legion and for what have you. And one of the commando colonels came to command the Arab legion, Brigadier Young, whom I knew well in Normandy and \u2014 and so you see, there were both sides, very weird for \u2014 for commandos. I mean, there was a demand for trained people. That still goes on in a way, because when I gave a book talk in Florida, a young man came in with a Rottweiler on a leach \u2014 leash and I \u2014 I-I was amazed they let him into the bookstore, and he said, can \u2014 do you live in this area? And I said no, I\u2019m just here for a few days. And he said, that\u2019s too bad, and I said why? And he said, I belong to a group that is very interested in commando training. So you see, there are jobs everywhere."

And there was one boy who always Interview with Peter Masters \u201c August 7, 1998 said, Palestinian. It was Jewish boy. And I \u2014 I must have asked him, why do you want to be a Palestinian? And he said, that\u2019s the country of our future. Obviously a \u2014 from a Zionist family. And I said why? And he said \u2014 he explained it to me as best as a young child could.

And so it took quite awhile to understand what this was all about. And of course, a lot \u2014 a lot of the most material contribution ca-came from Hitler, where people suddenly realized that however integrated the \u2014 and accepted or honored they thought they were, that didn't count any more.

And I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve only been to Israel once, and it was absolutely wonderful, and if I haven\u2019t recently gone back, it\u2019s largely because I have ma \u2014 we have discovered some distant relatives who want to take over if we go there, and we are a little afraid of that because we\u2019d rather be our own \u2014 determine on our own where we want to go, what we want to do.

I-I had hoped by the choice of my regiment and because I graduated high, you get your first choice to get to Oxford, because I chose to be commissioned 1n the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry. And I made mistake. They didn't send me to Cowley Barracks in Oxford, they sent me to Colchester [indecipherable] city, but brimful of soldiers. I was in para \u2014 in a barracks where there were three light infantry regiments. Each one had a different drill, totally different drill. So that if you were orderly officer, which you were often, as a junior Interview with Peter Masters \u201c\u00b0 August 7, 1998 officer, you had to get the orderly sergeant, who was usually an old hand, and put coins on the table. This half crown is me, this florin is you, this sixpence is the bugler, these are the ranks. And now, there were no words of command, it was all done silently and precisely and we marched together for 12 paces and halt. We about face, we do this, we do that, we [indecipherable] bugle \u2014 bugles and [indecipherable]. And the town would gather around the parade square, they would know it better than I did, certainly. There was, for instance, no ceremonial march past for the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. It was a bubble past, being light infantry, so you ran 12 abreast at the bubble, in step, in line and you were the officer out in front saluting the pedestal where the commanding officer stands. And if they don\u2019t look lined up properly or in step properly, it\u2019s your fault, although you haven\u2019t the slightest influence what\u2019s happening behind you. I also discovered that \u2014 so I had to learn three different drills. I also discovered that the \u2014 one of the reasons I had chosen the \u2014 the Ox and Bucks 1s because their airborne battalion had taken the bridges on D-Day and we linked up with them, and they had done a beautiful job taking these bridge intact. And they were delighted to see us, and we them. It turned out they were persona non grata in their own regiment, because the regulars at the base considered them irregular forces, air landing people [indecipherable] pilots, parachutists, what have you, as I was, you see? So the ones with the maroon beret of the airborne were looked at askance, and me with a green Interview with Peter Masters ot August 7, 1998 beret is even worse. And I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there, which I managed first of all to be sent to the school of infantry, and that was a course, company commanders course. And that\u2019s when the major there said didn\u2019t I want to stay as an instructor, because we hit it off perfectly. It was the same principal as the cadet school, I was telling them how it was and they agreed, because they were veterans from this campaign or that. And I turned it down for the illusion of freedom that I described to you. Well, after that, West Africa and happy to get out of this place where the people seemed to have the attitude that these irregular force pe \u2014 members were coming to take their jobs away [indecipherable] headquarters and God, I would have paid not to take it away, you know? I \u2014 I \u2014 I wa \u2014 I wanted out, out. It\u2019s terrible.

He said no, at the top. If you can\u2019t hack it, you go down one rung. Wisdom. Well, they bought two ideas for cartoons and I was so rich that I couldn\u2019t believe it. But this is before the commandos and the Interview with Peter Masters \u201c August 7, 1998 Pioneer corps. I-I got paid like for several months salary for two ideas. And I thought this is a lovely way of making a living. These were not political cartoons, they were like \u201cNew Yorker\u201d type cartoons. And I drew another batch and I said I would throw a party for the whole platoon, and the \u2014 nothing seemed to happen and then a terrible thing. Well, I went to the local pub where I was well known and I said, I-I must give this party. I have a whole batch of cartoons out there and when they come in I\u2019Il have plenty of money and right now I don\u2019t.

And the check hadn\u2019t come yet, th-the second installment, but after the party, I think one or two days later, it came saying the editor regrets at this time we are not buying any of the cartoons. And now I had absolutely six months to pay it off, you see. And I didn\u2019t draw a cartoon for a year and a half, in utter depression. Now, I still thought that in that direction was my \u2014 my \u2014 my future profession. I came out of the army and I made one brief attempt. I talked to a friend of my family\u2019s who was a\u2014as \u2014 journalist. And she wrote things about resorts who then gave her a limousine, and you know the bit. One of my daughters says it\u2019s half a step from prostitution, not journalism, but that\u2019s a matter of t \u2014 personal taste. Anyhow, I asked her, do you think there would be some opening as an apprentice journalist somewhere? And she said no, completely hopeless. You might sell one story about your war experience, maybe, but doesn\u2019t amount to much, everybody has stories. And I gave up. She\u2019s Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters \u201d August 7, 1998 still writing a \u2014 a Austrian cooking column for a Jewish magazine in London, very popular.

I haven\u2019t heard from her since. Anyhow, I gave up and I decided reluctantly I would have to go to school. So, my mentor, who had sent me with the cartoons, you know, to \u201cPunch,\u201d he said, I have a young woman friend who has just graduated from art school, and she said she would be willing to come and meet with you and advise you which school to go to and so on. So we met in his studio and she [indecipherable] sort of snippety, brisk young woman, and she said, I went to the Central School of Art and Crafts, it\u2019s \u2014 I consider it the best school. It\u2019s very hard to get in and you probably won\u2019t. And sh \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I said, you \u2014 you\u2019ve graduated from there? Yes, she had graduated from there, and she was a German refugee and she had been president of the student union, an elective office. Not bad for a\u2014 for a refugee. Well, I was this commando first lieutenant, you see, and I decided to go to that school and become president of the student union, as a matter of \u2014 point of honor, you see? And I did both. I\u2014I daresay my jingling uniform helped a bit to boost my portfolio, but it \u2014 they accepted me and I went to that school and I learned quite a lot. And after three years, my mother drew my attention to a middle paragraph in a paper that talked about Fulbright scholarships. And she said, wouldn\u2019t a graduate year be very beneficial for your career? Well, I had just Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters * August 7, 1998 begun to go and look for jobs and I found they paid nothing and wanted me to do things that I was not willing to do. I\u2014 I \u2014I asked one studio where I went for a job, what would I have to show you that you would hire me? And they produced an extremely realistic painting of a plate of bacon and eggs, wi-with fat bubble in the center, and very real. And that\u2019s an illustrator, you know, I mean, I \u2014 obviously whoever was talking to me didn\u2019t understand where I came from or didn\u2019t care. Anyway, I \u2014I said to myself, I shall never be able to do this and what\u2019s more I don\u2019t want to be able to do that. I\u2019m a problem solver, I\u2019m a designer, I \u2014 I\u2019m a\u2014 and for that they were willing to pay, I think, three pounds a week starting salary, and I \u2014 I thought that that was absolutely horrible. And I welcomed the opportunity to apply for the scholarship, for the Fulbright. And I did with full support of the principal of the school, a \u2014 a\u2014a Scottish painter who was not my friends because as president of the student union, you can imagine we had many, many skirmishes. But he said, America is entering what we entered in the first Elizabethan age, culturally, and you must go there. And o-off I went and they threw in a summer scholarship at Yale, six weeks. And money was a problem, because sterling was not converted \u2014 not that I had any. But 1-it \u2014 it created a problem, because most art schools are not boarding schools. So I had to live somewhere. So I lived at International House in New York, in the cheapest room in the basement, and developed techniques, how to eat for little or nothing. I was also helped by the fact that my mother had a couple of Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection Interview with Peter Masters \u00bb August 7, 1998 cousins where I was invited to dinner once a week and they\u2019d give me sandwiches for the next couple of days. And then I\u2019d buy a box of cereal and I\u2019d buy a loaf of bread. And I couldn\u2019t afford the school cafeteria, but I could buy 20 cents worth of bologna or cheese, and that would stretch for a couple of meals with my loaf of bread.

A-And \u2014 and I discovered the American luxury, there\u2019s free sugar in the cafeteria, where you can help yourself, put a couple of packages in your \u2014 in your pocket and with my box of cereal I had breakfast every morning, and my carton of milk, you know. And it \u2014 it worked. And I started to freelance. There was a woman who did [indecipherable] greeting cards, and I did the finished drawings.

And he \u2014 he paid for these designs, lots of money. And he didn\u2019t want them finished, he wanted them on tracing paper so he could trace them onto the blouses.

And \u2014 and \u2014 and there is the story I \u2014 I once mentioned to you, which I think is very wor \u2014 well worth saying. My ow \u2014 my own attitude was I could not live in this country, because I\u2019d just been through six years of war against discrimination and I was seeing the newspapers and what have you that din \u2014 din \u2014 discrimination in this country was rampant. I \u2014 I\u2014 I read the \u2014 the anti-Semitic diatribes of \u2014 of \u2014 on the hill, of [indecipherable] and \u2014 and Father Coughlin(ph) all this was not unfamiliar to me, but then the discrimination against black people seemed totally intolerable. And a couple of things happened. I arrived on the Queen Mary on my Fulbright, and there was a green uniformed customs official who looked at my papers and \u2014 and looked at my \u2014 my suitcase, my shipping trunk, whatever I had brought, and he said, how long do you propose to stay here? And I said, oh I don\u2019t know, I have a \u2014 a year\u2019s \u2014 I mean, a school year\u2019s scholarship, preceded by six weeks in Yale. And I might hitchhike around a bit to see some of the country. So, it\u2019ll be a year, or \u2014 or maybe 18 months at the most. And he said no. And I said, I \u2014 I beg your pardon? And this great big, red-haired Irishman, you see \u2014 I said, you mean I can\u2019t do that? Interview with Peter Masters \u201c August 7, 1998 And to my utter amazement he put his arm around my shoulder and he said, young man, this is the country to live. And we \u2014 we need young people to come here, and you don\u2019t want to go back after 18 months. And I was completely floored by this, because I had seen customs officials in \u2014 in Austria, in Germany, in France, in Britain, and never had anyone said a fre \u2014 a \u2014 a friendly word. It wasn\u2019t fashionable until that time. Now they say welcome to the country or something, but this 1s all the last few years, you know. To me, this was absolutely stunning.

And there were courses in \u2014 in politics and in English and in Interview with Peter Masters \u201c August 7, 1998 literature and so forth. And one of them was in sociology. The professor was a professor by the name of Serge(ph) Yamaki(ph), a Finnish American, young man who was wonderful. I had never had a professor like that. He told it how it is, talked straight. He talked about religion in this country. He said there are statistics about how many people go to church. I assure you a percentage, or a large percentage of the \u2014 the majority of people going to church \u2014 to various churches, doesn\u2019t matter which, are going to show their Sunday clothes, or their automobiles, or whatever. It becomes a social thing. It has very little to do with religion. We had a course \u2014 oh, oh and he talked about discrimination and about what must have been the first seedlings of the Civil Rights movement. And he said, this is an uphill struggle, it\u2019ll take a while, but it\u2019s moving along. We are correcting. There are \u2014 there are serious attempts to correct the wrongs of the past. And he went into detail saying what people were doing and what was going on and so on. And you had not heard about that in Europe, you only heard about the negative stories. So I became aware that somebody was trying to do something. And that was \u2014 that \u2014 I\u2019d perhaps been hasty when I said I could never live in a country where these things exist, as long as there were forces at work that were trying to counteract the \u2014 the \u2014 the bad things I had heard. Well then circumstances overtook me. I \u2014 I met my wife again, after we had known each other in London, in fact we had been double dating, but not a-as each other\u2019s partner. And she went to America when the Czech government in exile Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters * August 7, 1998 collapsed because of the Czech coup in Prague, the communist coup, and she was not going to go back to Prague under the communists. So, she had helped out the second world meeting of the International Monetary Fund which was in London, and sh-sh-she was o-on loan to them from the Czech government be \u2014 just before the coup. And they offered her a job in America and she said, I am very happy here, and when the Czech government collapsed, somebody remembered the \u2014 her job offer and he \u2014 he \u2014 he restated it and she accepted. So she came what she thought was for a year to work for the Monetary Fund in Washington, and she worked there for 36 years. And I came and \u2014 to the United States and one day \u2014 there was a Greek student in International House who said, I\u2019m hitchhiking to Washington, anybody want to come? I said, I know somebody in Washington, let me try and get to a telephone. Well, I tried and \u2014 and they told me that the United Nations were in Flushing Meadows, New York, and I said yes, but a branch, and I got a Russian operator and forget it, I could not convince her that there was any United Nations here, which of course there was, the World Bank and Monetary Fund, and a couple of other one. I gave up. So did the Greek chap, by the way. Said, ah, I\u2019m not going. So that was \u2014 I \u2014I\u2019d looked for telephone listings under her name, there was none. Anyway, I \u2014 I just gave up. I\u2014 a short while later she went on home leave, which was London, although she is from Slovakia. Ka \u2014 children\u2019s transport survivor. And my \u2014 our mutual friends gave her a book that had just come Interview with Peter Masters *\u00b0 August 7, 1998 out, \u201cThe Green Beret\u201d by Hilary Saint George Saunders. It was the first book about the commandos by a historian. And they said, bring that to Peter. And she said, where? He\u2019s in New York. Really? I\u2019m going through New York, I'll bring it to him. She did and I said I tried to come and see you in Washington, told her the story. She said, you \u2014 you must come and see Washington. So I hitchhiked to Washington, which if you had a straight ride took seven and a half hours, before everything. Before \u2014 before the bridge, before the parkway, before the tunnel in Baltimore. And I then developed the habit of hitchhiking after school on Friday to Washington and we got engaged and in the spring of 1950 we were married. And I could now stay under \u2014 as the family member of a U.N. employee, and work. And I got job in Washington and I\u2019ve been here ever since."

            "question": "In what ways was it significant to you that your wife was also a survivor?",
            "answer": "It was like a homecoming. I had been engaged to a \u2014 a \u2014 an Irish Protestant girl who was as liberal as the day is long and as bright as can be, and that, however, did not include her family. Her father was a colonel and he was the \u2014 one of the leading heart specialists in \u2014 in Ireland. And he wer \u2014 had been a colonel at [indecipherable] the African \u2014 north African campaign. He was actually in on the concentration camp reparations in Europe. And you would have thought that that might impact him in some way, and it di \u2014 it certainly impacted him, but the \u2014 the notion of his daughter marrying a foreigner, a Jew, an artist, all bad. You see, so the Interview with Peter Masters 7 August 7, 1998 \u2014 the mother was also a doctor, a research. The young woman herself, her father was a professor at Queens in Belfast. She went to Trinity in Dublin, which is, of course, Catholic. And so, we did a lot of commuting between Dublin and Belfast and I got s \u2014 deeply into the Irish problem, so similar to the Israeli problem, so similar to so many of the other discriminatory problems. And found th \u2014 intellectuals or not, there was no reasoning with the people. They believed every atrocity story. They told me the same atrocity stories north and south, with a change of characters. And \u2014 and the young people were generally against that. But they had a tremendous uphill struggle. Anyway, the mother, the researcher doctor said do not tell Dad that you are getting engaged, because it will kill him. In defense of this absurd attitude, let me tell you that my own family was not lagging far behind. And my mother\u2019s eagerness to get me on that graduate year to America was without a doubt largely motivated by \u2014 she was even willing to not be near me 1-1n order to save me from a fate worse than death 1n \u2014 in her \u2014 in her view. And \u2014 and so \u2014 so what \u2014 what can I say to you? It is a\u2014 an amazing thing. I have never found out what happened to this young woman, who was certainly completely innocent of \u2014 of anything that took place. And for awhile I was in \u2014 in agony to make a decision what I would do with my life before I decided to marry my wife, whom I admire tremendously as the child survivor of her entire family. The three children were the only survivors, everybody else was murdered. And so you do what you feel you Interview with Peter Masters \u201d August 7, 1998 must do. And I as \u2014 must say I \u2014 we\u2019ve had an absolutely marvelous marriage. With the millennium it'll be our golden wedding anniversary.

            "answer": "Not really, not really. I would say we had a mixed bag of friends, some refugees, Germany and Austria and Hungary and so on. And quite a few British people. You see, I\u2019ve been several people in my life. I\u2019ve been a student, so I had art student friends. I had \u2014 some of whom became very famous artists. I had been a\u2014a \u2014a soldier, not only with other foreigners, but with British colleagues. When I was in London just now, one of my friends from cadet school, who was a fellow commander with whom I'd actually done a night patrol in Normandy, without us realizing it until we told each other the stories, that we obviously were both on the same thing, in cadet school we were very close friends, and he is as English as they make them, and he came to see me up from Essex, where he now lives. And we said we\u2019ll have lunch in a pub, and a drink. And he told me that it was his 75\" birthday. And I said how c \u2014 how could you leave your family on your 75\" birthday? And he said, I told Peggy I\u2014 I w \u2014I wanted to do this. And he said, you don\u2019t realize it, but on my 50\" birthday I happened to be visiting you in Washington. And on my 21\u00b0 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters \u201d August 7, 1998 birthday we were both in Normandy. So I thought it appropriate. He also brought me a thing he had written about his D-Day experience. It is extremely moving. It was his father\u2019s birthday, D-Day. And when it was over, D-Day night, he said, I felt \u2014 I suddenly reflected that I was very grateful not to have spoiled my father\u2019s birthday by becoming a casualty. So, I\u2014 I \u2014I think his D-Day account is brilliant. He writes as I wish I could, and he in turn, has read \u2014 read my book and he said to me \u2014 he wrote me a letter and he said, I\u2019ve read your book, and you\u2019re not supposed to enjoy a book about such grim times and experiences. But you and I know that in between the grim times and experiences, we had some wonderful times. So forget what I said about \u2014 I really enjoyed your book, because it\u2019s like you were there, I mean, when you read it. And so is his. And he says, you know, D-Day wasn\u2019t so bad for us compared to what we experienced in the next few days afterwards, and that\u2019s true. But in describing his D-Day, he tells me where \u2014 you see, he was \u2014 he had a disadvantage over me. He was surrounded by all the people with whom he had trained. I was one of me attached to people I barely knew. A training mistake, they should have put me with them earlier. But, when they were killed, I didn\u2019t know them. When his buddies were killed, and one was like shot in half crossing a road in front of him, these were his friends. So it was much more personal for him, a-and I respect that, I mean I \u2014 I never saw one of my immediate friends killed or wounded. I saw a lot of people killed or wounded, but not my immediate friends. Interview with Peter Masters \u201d August 7, 1998 They were attached to the unit next door, as \u2014 a specialist as I was, to this. So it \u2014 it made a-an emotional difference that was to my advantage. I mean, I was shocked enough when I heard that two chaps down the road whom I knew very well had \u2014 had just been killed, you know, and so on. I don\u2019t see them. And I was Tommy gun guard for a burial party that buried, I don\u2019t know, 40 people. I didn\u2019t know any of them. So it \u2014 it \u2014 you know, these are all factors in this thing, it\u2019s a very, very personal the experiences."

I also was aware that many people were given immunity for \u2014 for reasons of practicality of \u2014 of [indecipherable] scientists who were needed and goodness knows what else. It did not involve me personally. I now welcome the Interview with Peter Masters \" August 7, 1998 notion that \u2014 that Palestine \u2014 that \u2014 that Israel came into existence, and I have mentioned to you before my Scottish principal with whom I used to skirmish in art school, and I remember that I was in his office when the assassination of Count Bernadotte came th-through \u2014 the news came through. And I said, I\u2019m shocked about that, one should not kill United Nations officials. I-I think that\u2019s beyond the pale. And he said, to my utter amazement, these are the birth pains of a new nation, and you have to accept it, that this is the sort of thing, we don\u2019t know the details. And later of course, I heard that Bernadotte was targeted because he was assuming a stance of a very unfavorable [indecipherable] and so on and so on. But I was amazed that this Scotsman had the vision to s \u2014 way beyond mine, that this was a thing you had to take into your stride. Anti-Semitism, which is coming back to early Christian, didn\u2019t affect, but you have to bear in mind that all our chaps had cover stories and many of them found the [indecipherable] of that cover story was comfortable, and so they didn't say who they were. Many of them didn\u2019t practice any religion particularly, and when it came to intermarriage, all of us were independent enough to say if I want marry an Eskimo, I will. Metaphorically speaking, quite a few married Eskimos, which some of them came to regret. But that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that on principle, you felt, I\u2019m my own person, I can do what I like. Now comes the question which is probably down your list somewhere, of \u2014 of h-how much did Judaism mean? It\u2019s very difficult. On the one hand, some of Interview with Peter Masters * August 7, 1998 us had a reaction, saying I don\u2019t want to belong to anything that excludes somebody. That\u2019s a very broad statement, but \u2014 but 1-it\u2019s meant to be. I don\u2019t want to belong to a Jewish club. That means only Jews can join, because that is the exclusion of somebody and that\u2019s what we were just fighting against. I don\u2019t want to belong to another club either, that include \u2014 excludes people. In fact, I don\u2019t want [indecipherable]. But it goes beyond that, because you say, if I send my children to Sunday school, or they belong to a club, I don\u2019t want to join any clubs. Clubs segregate. That\u2019s not always reasonable, but that\u2019s an emotional reaction to some of the things that have happened before. So you see, we did not send in our children to \u2014 to Sunday school. I had two daughters and a son. We had the son, the son was Bar Mitzvahed. The girls were not Bat Mitzvahed because we hadn\u2019t even heard of that in Europe. The son was Bar Mitzvahed. When he was born he did not have a bris, he was circumcised in the hospital. It\u2019s again the emotional reaction against belonging to something that excludes other people. It\u2019s quite absurd if you reflect upon it, and it\u2019s taken me years to \u2014 to \u2014 to overcome it. But \u2014 but it was a very real factor, possibly an error, socially, possibly an error religiously, because parallel to that are the war memories of going to shul with my grandfather, who was very, very serious about it, as my parents were not. And the tug of war between the sentiment an \u2014 of emotional tradition on the one hand, and the not wanting to belong to anything that excludes anybody else is an ongoing thing. Right now I\u2019m deeply Interview with Peter Masters \u201c August 7, 1998 embroiled in a fight that I find myself in, rather surprisingly. It is that the members of my troop of \u2014 of foreign refugees, want to put up a memorial to the troop and the 20 who were killed in north Wales where we were trained. This 1s all initiated by my book, where it suddenly has sort of come to \u2014 come alive, and a retired judge who was one of us, refugee from Germany, has taken the ball and is running with it like crazy, and the people in north Wales think that the movie will be made in \u2014 in north Wales, which of course doesn\u2019t follow. But \u2014 so the local council and the council of Wales is all in favor and has given us a lovely little green plot overlooking the ocean in this resort town, where they are going to put up a memorial. And when they drafted the words, it said, refugees from Nazi oppression. It did not use the word Jewish. And I\u2019m up in arms, and I say it has to include the word at least mostly Jewish. And in order to bring this about, I am fighting tooth and nail, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m enlisting the support of my surviving colleagues or their widows. I sought an interview with the Honorable Miriam Rothschild, who was married to one of our chaps and is a wealthy ma \u2014 scientist in her 90\u2019s. And she said, you must come down and talk about it, and I just now I went to the Rothschild estate and we spent all day talking and she is solidly on my side. And the \u2014 the thing that\u2019s happening is that some of the chaps who have embraced their cover story, don\u2019t want to break that cover story. It is as if they thought that the York massacre, of which they have never heard, happened last year rather than hundreds of years Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters \u201c August 7, 1998 ago, and that by assuming the \u2014 their identities as British citizens church of England, which is what our dog tags said, they are escaping any danger of anti- Semitism and they have forgotten who they really are. Or rather, they would like to forget. Not all of them. Some of the non-Jewish members of the troop, there is a \u2014a \u2014a fellow, he is now in his 80s, friend of mine, who \u2014 whose name is Gizer(ph), he served under the name of Gordon. He is a grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph). Walter Liebknecht(ph) was the buddy and companion of Rosa Luxemburg, if that means anything to you, early German communism. His father, the son of Walter Liebknecht(ph) \u2014 Walter Liebknecht(ph) was assassinated by forerunners of the Nazis in the 20s. There is a Kathe Kollwitz woodcut, a gorgeous woodcut of the \u2014 the body of Walter Liebknecht(ph) and mourners. She was very much involved in that, Kathe Kollwitz. Well, the grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph), not Jewish, said there is not a drop of Jewish club in \u2014 blood in me, but I respect, applaud and salute my Jewish comrades and their bravery and I am on your side that it should say mostly Jewish on the monument. Another one, Ron Gilbert Goodman, he served in undercover intelligence in Germany after his command of duty. He got an MBE, Member of the British Empire in \u2014 from \u2014 from the queen, and he said \u2014 he maintained his cover longer than anybody, because he had to. He was \u2014 he was catching Nazis, you see. Post-war Nazis. And he said \u2014 it was a bit embarrassing because he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s widowed, his girlfriend wanted to read the book and he thought Interview with Peter Masters . August 7, 1998 well, that will break my cover as far as she\u2019s concerned. But while he \u2014 they were discussing it, she got it from Amazon dot com and read it and \u2014 and he said, the hell with the cover, I\u2019m on your side. He remembers that he was forced to destroy his shul, by the Nazis. So you see, for the judge, it\u2019s probably very difficult to go to the Welsh council and say, on reflection, it ought to say mostly Jewish. And I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s man enough to do it. But if he isn\u2019t, Pll withdraw my support. That\u2019s how that one 1s."

And when she \u2014 ou-our man, of course, was under his cover story, the one who was engaged to her, so he couldn\u2019t say anything in particular. And when they were married, they kicked him out too. So, for that reason she was against that memorial and I said to her, I\u2019m much more confrontational than you are. If there was a manifestation as you describe, of anti-Semitism, the more reason to have a Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 memorial there saying mostly Jewish, so that, you know, what\u2019s wrong with that? And she agreed with me."

And \u2014 but he respected me and I respected him in \u2014 1n-in \u2014 in our stubbornness. And what he knew, I really don\u2019t know. I told you some of my fellow students became very famous. I tried to talk one of them out of his career because he wanted to be a scenic designer and I said, there\u2019s no future in that field. And he almost changed his major, but then he stayed a scenic designer. He 1s now one of the most famous ones in the world. He has, I think, a CBE from the queen and he is working. We couldn\u2019t meet because he was doing an amphitheater in the south of France. And he called me and we had a long chat. And then he is going to ho \u2014 Peking, and then he is going to Hong Kong and then he is going to Kuala Lumpur and in between he is doing \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d in Copenhagen. In \u2014 he was doing \u201cNabucco,\u201d which is a Jewish Verdi opera, I mean, Jewish subject about Nebuchadnezzar and what have you, and the Jews in the south of France, in the hotbed of French neo-Nazism. And so he had, in an amphitheater, which makes it more difficult, he projected a Star of David over the amphitheater. And at first it Interview with Peter Masters \u2122 August 7, 1998 was going to be during the famous Nabucco chorus of the \u2014 of the Jews. And then he said, in reflection, after reflection, I\u2019d like to make a political statement. So I want it from the beginning of the overture, through the first act, the Star of David projected onto the entire amphitheater."

For you, as a Jewish refugee, what was going on in your mind in England in those days?",
            "answer": "Well, as I have really explained when I talked to you about my conversations with Mr. Johnson \u2014 I didn\u2019t mention his name either, William Johnson was the Scottish painter who was the principal of my school. He must be long dead. I \u2014 a-at first abhorred the violence, and it took me awhile to \u2014 to settle into the understanding that he had ahead of me. I \u2014 I could not at first fathom that oh, blowing up the King David hotel was a good thing to do, you see. Difficult. I \u2014 I-I respect his explanation that he gave, saying the birth pangs of a nation, you see. But, at first it was very difficult to grasp that the average \u2014 I mean, you have to bear in mind, you\u2019re a British soldier and you are assigned to this. Now, I have a friend who was in the Pioneer corps with me, his name is Peter Bloch(ph). He is from Germany, a refugee, Jewish refugee. He volunteered and he got into the 21\" independent parachute company, which was \u2014 had some foreigners in it, British parachute company. He found himself in Greece, fighting civilians, political civilians and he hated it. It \u2014 1t ma \u2014 pushed him wa \u2014 way over left politically and then he was assigned to Palestine with the six \u2014 with the first airborne division. And he said, I don\u2019t want to go. And they said, well, what do you mean? You are a war hero, you\u2019re \u2014 he said, I\u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 you can call me what you will. I may have been a war hero in your eyes, but now I\u2019m a conscientious objector. And I think he Interview with Peter Masters ~ August 7, 1998 managed that, conscientious objection not to serve with the first airborne in \u2014 British first airborne in what was Palestine. And surely you can understand it. I can\u2019t understand that it threw him, but I can understand but I don\u2019t agree that it made him go way over to the left when he studied at the [indecipherable] school of economics and we used to have arguments about that. And I think he has settled down more or less as a liberal. But a\u2014 a \u2014 a\u20141n~\u20141n his youth certainly the people he was hanging out with were \u2014 were a mixed bag of people who were reading the \u201cDaily Worker\u201d in the London underground demonstratively, and I remember hearing them complain saying I wish they\u2019d give us a new one, I\u2019m getting fed up holding this paper all the time. But it\u2019s done for demonstrative purposes, you see. The \u2014 well, the whole communism question, of course had s \u2014 got into the act in that when \u2014 when Stalin did some of the things he did, he became unacceptable, and the people who had been supportive of \u2014 of \u2014 of communism suddenly found themselves in a rather awkward position, because how do you backtrack when you\u2019ve been such an enthusiast? And suddenly you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 the people you have been following are committing atrocities that you cannot \u2014 cannot accept. So, I \u2014 I never \u2014 I never got into that communist game as so many young students did. I suppose it was a question of upbringing, because after losing World War I, for which many Jewish Austrians were great enthusiasts, they \u2014 they suddenly found that war is hell. Meaning the depression following it, meaning defeat, meaning the Interview with Peter Masters * August 7, 1998 peculiar post-war \u2014 post World War I dealings, politically, where Austria was completely emaciated to a six million country from being a world empire. And peculiarly Germany, which was the much younger country, something like 2,000 years of Austria compared to 90 years of Germany. Germany was intact and more powerful than ever after \u2014 well, not economically, but \u2014 but territorially. So, you hear of Germans yearning for a return to power. You ga \u2014 you do \u2014 never hear of Austrians yearning for a return to power, because they were made up of so many minorities, that wanted to be torn apart. Which you see again in what used to be Yugoslavia. Every minority wants to be independent, whether they are viable or not. First independence, then maybe we\u2019ll confederate. I'll believe it when I see it. Terrible."

            "question": "Is there anything else that you would like to add about your years in postwar England?",
            "answer": "My years in postwar England were primarily as a student. I had a \u2014 a wonderful time. I had \u2014 there was no G.I. bill, but there was a so-called further education and training grant, which was more modest than the G.I. bill, but it certainly sustained me together with my freelance activities. And I had my \u2014 my own apartment in southwest London, and I traveled mostly by bicycle, and by underground. And I had lots of friends Wartime friends, English friends, English friends from cadet school. I had some with whom I corresponded for years afterwards and the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters ~ August 7, 1998 correspondence only ended because they died. I had a brilliant friend who wrote me sheafs of letters, all not about news, but about philosophical observations. I have kept them all. I \u2014 I find that \u2014 well, the Latin proverb, Ubi bene ibi patria. Where I\u2019m well, there is my country, applies to some extent. I could live in England easily, but I could live anywhere unless the system of the country were such that I could not stomach it. I have a reluctance to visit countries in my travels where there is the juxtaposition of luxurious wealth and abject poverty, which has kept me away from China, from India and many other countries. I-It is perhaps a \u2014a\u2014a-\u2014an ostrich policy of simply not wanting to see it, but I find it distressing. I would say it includes Mexico. I\u2019ve been to Mexico once to a Club Med and I don\u2019t think Pll go there again. I-It\u2019s not my thing. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I find that postwar England, I \u2014 I \u2014 I never really worked in England, other than on a farm as a boy, which did me a lot of good, and briefly on being released from internment \u2014 I did not go from internment into the army, I went from internment to being released, forgotten out momentarily, and then into the army, when I was old enough. I \u2014 I worked for a Polish publisher, and I was nothing. I mean, I was a gopher. And I have therefore, no work experience in England that could be called a work experience. The \u2014 the thing about the bacon and eggs picture turned me off rather solidly. Whether I would have gotten into my profession, I would imagine I would. I don\u2019t know how it would have worked. I\u2019m \u2014 I can\u2019t, I really don\u2019t know. In this country there was a Interview with Peter Masters ~ August 7, 1998 certain realization, that if you have any talents at all, there is someone somewhere to whom those talents are worth money, and they are willing to pay for it. They might be willing to pay as little as possible, but on the other hand, if you are reasonably alert and if you are willing to go where it\u2019s at \u2014 which is something that almost no other country seems to have. I mean, I can\u2019t picture people doing what people in this country have been doing for a couple of generations, that is the economic situation in our town is bad, so we put everybody in the car and drive to a state where I understand you can get a job. People ga \u2014 actually do that. They don\u2019t do it elsewhere. And most of all, I realize that in this country, if something bothers you and you are willing to spend some time trying to remedy it \u2014 1t needn\u2019t be a very political thing, it can be the bumps on the street, or \u2014 or the speed limit, or whether your school needs an addition. You don\u2019t have to \u2014 to \u2014 to give up your job to \u2014 to pursue this. You work on in a little bit and then get together with a few people who are like-minded. And in your own lifetime \u2014 even in \u2014 within the next few years, something actually starts to happen. Sometimes too fast. I come back to the bumps where they \u2014 they want the bumps in, then now they want the bumps out. And when they\u2019re out they will want them in again. You know, I mean, and \u2014 and \u2014 and that actually happens, at great expense and with a big effort. But you try and do that in some other country, and you know what\u2019s gonna happen? Nothing is gonna happen. Maybe it\u2019s changing a little, slowly now, and there are things happening here and Interview with Peter Masters ~ August 7, 1998 there. But by and large, you run your head up against a wall, and the wall, the base of the wall is littered with the bleached bones of people who have tried before you, and some of them were good people, but they failed. Well, that\u2019s a big discouragement to run your head against the wall. I have participated in some of these things in this country. Got an addition built at the elementary school where my children went, which actually came into use while the youngest one was still there. You know, I mean, unheard of in \u2014 in \u2014 1n other countries. Doesn\u2019t \u2014 doesn\u2019t happen, doesn\u2019t happen. So I find it enormously refreshing, and you can take some of the other things in your stride a little bit if you know that on the other hand, this exists."

I would like to get a sense of what was happening in your life, now you\u2019re newly married and you are now in the Washington, D.C. area. What was happening to you professionally and personally in the 1950s?",
            "answer": "I first g \u2014 my \u2014 my wife arranged that I should see a man who was himself a n \u2014 a German refugee, and he re \u2014 had a small public relations agency, that was a new profession. And he would steer me to where I might get a job as a graphic designer. Well, I went to see him, and he decided to employ me. In some \u2014 in many respects that was a disaster. It was a very small firm, of more heads than employees. And the attitude was rather peculiar. I was now the art director and the art department all in Interview with Peter Masters * August 7, 1998 one, and we didn\u2019t have many jobs to do. Through family connections he got an assignment where I \u2014 where there were to be free full page, full color ads in \u201cHK squire\u201d magazine. I had never done anything like it, and neither had anybody else there. So it was my assignment. I not only designed them, I wrote them, I supervised the photography, I went into unbelievable acrobatics. And they came out, for those times, pretty well. One of the partners suggested that I be given a bonus, because I think I earned 30 dollars a week. The big boss said, he is an artist and he had the fun of doing it, it\u2019s a bad idea to give him a bonus. And they didn\u2019t. This kind of attitude made it a little difficult. I-It was in everything. I mean, if we did get money for this, there\u2019s no doubt we did, he would buy a new oriental rug for the office. And I designed a shiny brass nameplate for downstairs on [indecipherable] street where we were \u2014 had a \u2014 had a upstairs office with a three- dimensional logo which I had designed in the \u2014 custom made in brass. I mean, we were really going for it, and everybody had their own hand-engraved business card, and \u2014 which we really couldn\u2019t afford, you know? And \u2014 and the \u2014 well, we went to a meeting for \u2014 with \u2014 with some corporate association, and I discovered the thing I mentioned elsewhere in \u2014 in other connections, and that is that nobody was saying anything, and we were to sell these people on why we wanted to do this. So I spoke up and I said, here\u2019s what we need to do. We actually did a brochure for them. That was unprecedented, and \u2014 and 1-1t wouldn\u2019t have happened if I hadn\u2019t sold them on Interview with Peter Masters *\u00b0 August 7, 1998 the concept, because it was way out modern for them at that time, you know. Well, ultimately everybody quit, and I was the sole employee. The boss took a job with the government and said, don\u2019t ever call me there unless there\u2019s an utter emergency. And then he said, I see here an advertisement that the Pentagon is \u2014 wants to retain an agent, an advertising agency for the army. So why don\u2019t you go and bid on that. Me. And I said, you know, tha-that\u2019s a bit absurd, because they are looking for a big corporation to handle this. Never mind, you do as you\u2019re told. I went to the Pentagon and to this room full of colonels and what have you and advertising agencies from all over the country. And the colonel who made the opening speech said any firm whose business would be doubled by this account 1s disqualified. Obviously it didn\u2019t want small time people. I knew my boss so I stayed til the end of the talk and I came back and I said, we are disqualified because of this stipulation. And he said why? And I said, because if your business is doubled. He said, well, it would do much more than double our business, so we are all right. And he was absolutely ser-serious, you see. So I\u2014 I \u2014 he filled out the forms, I filled out the forms and he sent them in. I was still the only employee. After awhile there was \u2014 the door rang one day \u2014 doorbell rang and it was a team to evaluate our facilities. That was rather difficult for me, but I had been trained to improvise, and I said several people are on assignment with [indecipherable] and several people are on vacation, and right at this moment I am the only person here just for this next hour Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 or so. Would you rather come back another time, or what? And they said, perhaps we should. And there were lots of empty desks and the place was very elegant, with the oriental rug and all the other stuff. And they left, and I called the boss at work in government. I told you never to call me. I said, well, I think this is an emergency. These guys might come back any time, I \u2014 they \u2014 they don\u2019t \u2014 I tried to pin them down, but they said they come for random inspection. And he said, I\u2019m coming over. And he came and he said, you know, in \u2014 we \u2014 we have to do something. And he said, I just crossed Lafayette Park. We could take some of the bums from the benches, and some of them are your size and some of them are mine, and could dress them up and sh \u2014 have them \u2014 give them a shave and they could be sitting at the desks when these pe \u2014 if \u2014 if only we knew when they are coming again. I \u2014 I said, you know, I \u2014 I don\u2019t think that that\u2019Il work. He was deadly serious. Well, a short while later, he had the account of an African nation, and who was doing it? I. We had a newsletter. I had absolutely no material for the newsletter, but I went to the ambassador and interviewed him, and I went to look at the postage stamps of the country, and there \u2014 there were some animals that were indigenous only to that country, so I went to the zoo and talked to the director about whether he had any of these specimen, and he did, and I had a photographer and I took pictures in the zoo, and pictures of the stamps and I got a congratulatory letter from a philatelist at the Smithsonian saying I wish more people were doing this. He didn\u2019t know I was Interview with Peter Masters ~ August 7, 1998 doing it out of desperation, you see. And then the boss was invited for the inauguration of the president in that country, and he went, and was decorated. And I said, be sure to keep me informed so I can write the newsletter that should get to the guests before they go \u2014 all go home. And he said he would, and he sent me nothing. And I was getting progressively more desperate because I felt duty-bound to do this and I called his wife. And I said, is he writing to you? And she said yes. I said, can I see the letters? She said no, they are rather private. I said, cross out the private things and \u2014 and I \u2014I have to have something of what\u2019s going on. Didn't get anything. I finally took \u2014 fished out accounts of the first inauguration. This was a re-Inauguration of a second term president, and I wrote as if somebody had been there, and if it described the \u2014 the women\u2019s dresses in general terms, I described the women\u2019s dresses in general terms. And I \u2014 I \u2014 I just winged the whole thing and \u2014 and showed pictures of the previous inauguration. And I had it all just about done, with each story on one desk and now all I had to do is assemble it, and he came back and he said, the place 1s in an awful mess. And I said mess? The mess is each desk, since nobody sits at the desks, it\u2019s one story. It\u2019s perfectly organized, I \u2014 it\u2019s the only way I can get this thing out in time. And he said, first we\u2019re going to get the place shipshape. I said, you touch one of these stories, I\u2014 I\u2019m out of here. He touched the stories, and I quit. And then he wanted to pay me to come back to put out the issue, and so I \u2014 but I mean, for the swan song, but I wa \u2014 you know, there Interview with Peter Masters ~ August 7, 1998 was simply no way. So I called all the people who had quit before, half a dozen and one of them was working for channel nine television. And he said, how would you like to be a television art director? I said, well there\u2019s one catch, I know nothing about television. He said, neither does anybody else, it\u2019s new. Why don\u2019t you come on out, I can\u2019t promise anything, but we\u2019ll see. I went out and I was television art director, and it was lots of fun. Pioneers, you know. Never before. Live television. We did fantastic things. We had more courage than good sense. We \u2014 we \u2014 we did spectacular things, we got \u2014 and being Washington we did network things, and I-I did presidential broadcasts for several presidents, some at the White House, some in the studio. I \u2014 then \u2014 then CBS did a survey and discovered that the country was read for country music. I think the survey meant Simon and Garfunkel, but they didn\u2019t understand that, and so we got Jimmy Dean. And we did the Jimmy Dean show, network, and I had a ball. I had a free hand to do what I like. I did a network musical every week. It meant not sleeping for one night, working clean acro \u2014 around the clock. And for couple of adjacent night, if we got home by two or three in the morning, we were doing well. And I decided I had to make a move financially, so I went to the management, which was as autocratic as they come, and I said, you are not charging enough for my services. That was the approach. And they said, how much should we be charging? I said, well first of all, \u2019'd like to have a percentage, like all the other talent is getting. Oh really, how much do you have in Interview with Peter Masters \u201c\" August 7, 1998 mind? So I\u2014 my wife and I had a long session over the weekend, because if I said the right amount, they would cut it in half. If I said too much they would laugh and fire me. If I said not enough, they would accept it. So I had to say too much, but just enough too much that by cutting it back 1t would be reasonable. And that actually worked. And it was based on the premise that the role of Washington television would increase. I was much more optimistic than they were, and I was right. The trouble was when I didn\u2019t get any sleep any more, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t have time to bill, so that my bills were accumulations of several weeks. And that meant the check was large, and that meant the person who had to sign the check was signing a check that was bigger than his. It wasn\u2019t really bigger than his, but it was by the fact that it was several weeks. And that irked them. So after a period of time, they said, we are going to terminate this agreement. And I said, and what? And they said, we ll \u2014 we\u2019ll see that you are all right. Well, seeing that was \u2014 I was all right was a ludicrous joke compared to what I\u2019d been earning. So I said, I don\u2019t know whether that is acceptable. So they said, do you want to see the president, whom we could never see. I met him in the elevator and usually told him what \u2014 what \u2014 what I \u2014 what I needed and he would support me, because I was an asset. This time they were waiting. You want to see the president? Sure. I walked in and he was \u2014 you know, it was the days of having no desk and a long settee and he was sitting on the armrest with his feet up on the settee and said, sit down. I was sitting 12 foot away Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters \" August 7, 1998 on the long settee. And he said, can we help you to relocate? And I said, I \u2014 I think Pll manage. And in the meantime they offered my assistant, who was Afro- American, my job at half the salary. And he quit and we formed a partnership, and we freelanced for \u2014 after 10 years, for channel nine, really doing, if I say so myself, an excellent bloody job. We were way ahead of people, right to the right and left. Some of them even called us and said, you are giving us a hard time, you are doing such fascinating things that our management is constantly on us. We freelanced for another five years, as you know, a design partnership. Now, we did work for the other networks. We did the [indecipherable] orbital launch for ABC, we did the inaugural coverage for ABC. We are \u2014 we had been CBS. They had \u2014 they deliberately prevented us from doing freelance for a few years, out of sheer malice. Ultimately we got into a difficult situation because my partner \u2014 we were doing a \u2014 a fashion show at the Mayflower with Lyndon Johnson\u2019s daughters. And we were building a \u2014 a\u2014 a walkway and sets and this was in Herndon, Virginia and I\u2019d worked there all day and I was getting very tired, and I said, can you come out and finish up, and he said sure. And as he walked into the shop where we were building things, a guy hit a knot on a four by four [indecipherable] his lathe, and a piece flew off like a shell and hit him \u2014 hit my partner over the head and he had a fractured skull. And he didn't want to be hospitalized in Virginia in those days. So he got on the phone and arranged for his ambulance and hospitalization in the Interview with Peter Masters \u00b0\" August 7, 1998 district where his sister was a nurse for a neurosurgeon. And he said, I\u2014 I have a fractured skull, can you come and get me? It\u2019s near Dulles airport, th-they took an hour before he was in that hospital. And they put in a metal plate and \u2014 and I found him a lawyer, and he got enough insurance compensation to buy a couple houses on Capitol Hill. And talking about anti-Semitism, or anti-black or anti anything, my art director colleagues in Washington would sometimes take me aside and say, we respect what a courageous thing you are doing. And I said, what am I doing? And they said, you have a black partner. And I said, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m courageous, we work well together. And they would say yes, but it can\u2019t be easy. I say, it\u2019s no problem at all, we have \u2014 we have always worked together where we could work on one piece of rush work where I start on the right and he starts on the left and we meet in the middle and it looks like one piece. What more could you want? See? So that was still even in the creative arts a\u2014 a-\u2014a fact that people respected me for doing this. And reversely, I advertised for an assistant and one of my friends and colleagues called up and said, we lost one big account, so we have to lay off a couple of designers. We highly recommend so and so. He is Jewish, but he\u2019s a very nice guy. But he is a very nice guy. I hired him, but that still went on, you see, and that\u2019s in the liberal arts. So maybe that\u2019s why my friends in England want to duck out from the words on the monument. Interview with Peter Masters \u201c August 7, 1998"

            "question": "You had been telling me about five years of freelance work after 10 years working with CBS.",
            "answer": "This Washington CBS station, which was, at one time, owned and operated by \u201cThe Washington Post,\u201d but it was also Washington\u2019s CBS station and we did originate it, Washington being Washington, presidential broadcasts and so forth. And I did [indecipherable] I did some at the White House with President Eisenhower, subsequently with President Kennedy. We did a great big show at the \u2014 at the Sheraton Park Hotel, which was called, Dinner with the President, seven cameras, prime time, with Kennedy in attendance and Johnson in attendance, and a cast of stars. Josh White, Hanya Holm ballet, the CBS symphony orchestra. Robert Preston was the MC, the movie actor who did, you know, \u201c76 Trombones,\u201d etcetera. And Josh \u2014 I said Josh White, the folk singer. The Clancy brothers. These were big names at the time, and Judy Collins and \u2014 Interview with Peter Masters \u00b0\u00b0 September 25, 1998 and I did a lot of id \u2014 scenery and had to build a stage because they didn\u2019t have one. And had to build dressing rooms downstairs. And that was quite \u2014 quite an exciting project, I enjoyed it thoroughly. I remember President Kennedy sitting there at the table facing the stage when his alarm went off. His \u2014 his wristwatch alarm to tell him that he had to \u2014 only so much more time to \u2014 to stay. And he made some joke about it, he was very quick with things like that. He was very funny. Very, very nice event, very warm hearted. I remember they had written things especially for him. There\u2019s an old American song called, \u201c\u201cWe Want No Irish Here,\u201d which was, you know, prejudice against the Irish immigrants. And they sang that facetiously, and lots of fun. Well done, great success. So I \u2014 I af \u2014 you want to know what happened afterwards in \u2014 after my television years, I freelanced for the other networks. I did the six orbital flight for ABC. There was some scenery and some background material. I did inauguration of Kennedy for ABC, when it snowed so hard, we had great problems because it was almost impossible to get to the capital. On the way the truck broke down, and we had to get this show on the air. So we \u2014 we had a little pickup truck with \u2014 with \u2014 to \u2014 to build the booth at the stand facing the inauguration platform. And we called the American Automobile Association to help us, and they said, we can\u2019t help anyone who 1s not blocking traffic on the \u2014 on the parade route \u2014 on the route. So we said, thank you very much. And there were three of us in that pickup truck, my Interview with Peter Masters \"\u00b0 September 25, 1998 construction man and his assistant and I. And we pushed the truck to where it was blocking traffic in the inauguration route because we \u2014 we obviously had to get there. And without making another phone call, a roving AAA service truck got us started and we \u2014 in \u2014 in the snow, and we made it to the capital. The next near disaster was that the moisture of the snow that was melting on top of the flimsily constructed booth was leaking into the booth and short circuiting the cameras. And \u2014 and w \u2014I mean, we an \u2014 we knew we would short circuit the cameras. Well, I \u2014 when you\u2019re a television art director, one thing you know how to do is where to get help quickly and who is reliable to come through and so on. I mean it \u2014 this was in the days of live television, 1-1t might be the sort of thing where somebody wanted to have a sailboat in the studio in the two hours and you would find one and get one into the studio in two hours. I once had a taxi pick up a chestnut man, you know, who \u2014 in the street, with his little oven, roasting \u2014 there was only one in Washington, in New York they used to be on every corner in the winter. And I knew where he was and we needed him for a live show, and I had a taxi pull up next to him and offer him, I think 10 bucks if he came. And h-he did, and they loaded his whole paraphernalia, the hot stove and we had him in the studio, you know. That\u2019s how we used to do things. Well, I knew a \u2014 a construction \u2014a-\u2014a roofing person in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u2014 in Virginia, and I got him out in the snow to get \u2014 fight his way through to the capital to lay that stuff on top of the booth to keep the Interview with Peter Masters \"\" September 25, 1998 water out. And in those days we were not pooled but this \u2014 we \u2014 I was doing ABC, and the people I had \u2014 used to work with was ceeb \u2014 from CBS were next door in the next booth. And I went over to a man with whom I\u2019d had many skirmishes because I felt that the \u2014 the \u2014 what shall I say, the \u2014 the good of the country preceded our little professional skirmishes. And I said to him, Bill, your cameras are going to short out. And he said, oh my God, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. What can I do? And I said, I have an \u2014 I happen to have a roofing guy come who 1s laying insulation on top of my booth, I\u2019Il have him lay some on top of your booth if you\u2019re willing to pay him for what he is doing. He\u2019s \u2014 he won\u2019t charge you much. And he was so grateful, you know, and I\u2019m sure that that kept him \u2014 kept CBS on the air for the coverage of the Kennedy inauguration. When it was over somebody stole all the furniture, even though to get to the booth, you had to get up a ladder. You know, it was a\u2014 a rather improvised arrangement, a \u2014 a plywood nailed together to make a platform and so on. And somehow they managed to unload that furniture during the night following the inauguration. And wasn\u2019t much furniture, but it was a desk and whatever, you know, for the newscasters a chair and a rug, and it was gone. Those were the exciting days of live television, I don\u2019t think it quite goes on that way now. Was really wonderful. After that I did some shows for the United States Information Agency, ITV, and my assistant \u2014 my \u2014 my partner and I did a number of shows for them which were seen all over the world, they had Interview with Peter Masters \"\" September 25, 1998 an English learning thing that we-went international and was probably seen by more people than any television show ever se \u2014 as a series. And we tried to give them \u2014 whe-when we came they looked rather amateurish and \u2014 and we were retained to do a\u2014 a f\u2014a couple of seasons, I believe, of thei \u2014 all their shows, internationally seen. And we tried to make them look like network television, and I think we did. Politically \u2014 when I say politically, I mean professional politically, it was rough going. Very, very difficult to deal, because \u2014 to deal with these people, because television and \u2014 and \u2014 and government don\u2019t mix easily. The bureaucracy 1s too \u2014 too slow, too complex, and too \u2014 frequently too f\u2014 too unreasonable to do things that \u2014 that need simple and quick solutions and \u2014 and w- we \u2014 we managed it as best we could, but it was not altogether a happy \u2014 a happy situation. They would say, for instance, we have \u2014 we need to hire additional help, and we haven\u2019t got the government slots, so why don\u2019t you hire them under contract? And that\u2019s not altogether proper, but again, it \u2014 absolutely necessary at times, you \u2014 you \u2014 you can\u2019t get \u2014 if you can\u2019t get the work done, you can\u2019t get on the air, and if you \u2014 a deadline 1s a deadline and so forth. And s \u2014 then you have to make, as an outsider, decisions whether you want to do this if \u2014 if it \u20141f you can see its urgency. And then, very frequently, you don\u2019t get the backup it requires to continue doing it. Like they would say, we have a person we \u2014 whom we want you to hire and you hire that person and recognize that this 1s a big mistake, but you\u2019re Interview with Peter Masters \u201d\" September 25, 1998 stuck in an in-between situation. I-It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not altogether a \u2014 you \u2014 you really have to walk a tightrope of \u2014 of constant difficult professional ethical decisions how you handle this, recognizing that the need on the one hand, downright patriotic need in \u2014 in the case of \u2014 I mean, they \u2014 they say they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not a ministry of propaganda and I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ll accept that, but naturally they are trying to tell the world about what America is doing, and to give people news that would otherwise not have an unbiased news report of any international event. So, the responsibility weighs heavily on you, and you try and do the best you can, and while you are doing it, you are being hampered by all kinds of nonsense. So that, as I say, is not altogether easy. After a period of time, I had \u2014 when was it? Yes, I worked f \u2014 I was then asked by the office of economic opportunity to work on the war on poverty, President\u2019s Johnson\u2019s war on poverty. And I became its first art director. Now, for \u2014 for Sargent Shriver, President Kennedy\u2019s brother-in-law, and we have been friends ever since. And that was a-again, a very fascinating experience, because pa \u2014 the war on poverty was a \u2014 a thing that if you were involved in it, you were enthused to the point of \u2014 of personal dedication. I see images of that time where 20 or more people \u2014 20 of us would get a mailing ready, and it didn\u2019t matter what rank you were, there were the top officials and \u2014 and the bottom officials in tennis shoes, running around tables, stuffing envelopes to get the thing out that had to be out the next day. And from my point of view, I Interview with Peter Masters \u201d September 25, 1998 designed the image of the whole thing, the \u2014 the \u2014 the logos, the emblems, the visual impact which was necessary because we had to do everything we could to muster the enthusiasm of a \u2014 a \u2014 a nation that was not always enthusiastic about the specific things we were trying to do. If you tried to open a job corps camp somewhere where you were training underprivileged youngsters, these were teenagers and \u2014 and people were afraid of them. They were racial \u2014 there were racist prejudices, where they said we don\u2019t want that next to our town, you know, and th-the \u2014 the kind of thing we had to try and overcome. I remember incidents where in some job corps camp young men stole a car and drove it into a station wagon with a family and several members of that family were killed. And the next day there was an outcry and the persec \u2014 across the country saying this program is no good. Well, it \u2014 nothing to do with the quality of the program and he would have stolen the car if he had not been in the job corps presumably, and no reason to assume otherwise. Bu \u2014 and to \u2014 to \u2014 to then crucify the program because s- somebody had deviated what was the kind of thing that we were at times up against. There were a\u2014a story possibly apic \u2014 apocryphal that went around, that the mayor of a town who didn\u2019t want to have a job corps camp next to him said, these are going to be the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 I \u2014 I have se \u2014 now the camp had already opened and he was trying to get it closed down. And the mayor said, th-the \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s predominantly blacks in this program, and the official from the war on poverty Interview with Peter Masters m September 25, 1998 office of economic opportunity said, as a matter of fact, it\u2019s 50 percent white. It \u2014 it\u2019s no \u2014 as a matter of fact, it\u2019s only 50 percent black. And the mayor responded, well, you see, if it were 50 percent white, that would make it all right. Which, as I say, possibly apocryphally illustrates y \u2014 the absurdity of the prejudice. The \u2014 then there was this \u2014 a s \u2014 a sudden solution for some of our problems because some brilliant mind, probably Sargent Shriver invented Head Start. Head Start being a preschool program when children are perceived to be cute and \u2014 and little, and not a threat. And yet, in and of itself a most useful thing because the learning process should start pre school, as I think we have all come to realize. And that was started with a tea at the White House. It was inaugurated and announced, and \u2014 and I designed its \u2014 its \u2014 its logo and so on of a couple of building blocks, symbolically. Lady Bird Johnson officiated at this opening, of which I had like two days notice, and it\u2019s still in existence now. And I just had a letter from Sarge Shriver about it, because I wrote a short article about how we \u2014 we \u2014 the obstacle course of getting that logo in to the White House tea in \u2014 with \u2014 with no advance notice. And it was not without problems, because one of the things the legislation had said was, the maximum feasible participation of the poor. And it was not easy to get \u2014 to recruit poor people who understood the state of the art methodology of dealing with pre-school children, because many of them had themselves been treated very casually, or neglected in their own preschool period or \u2014 and later. Interview with Peter Masters \" September 25, 1998 And to then put them into a responsible positions to do it in such a way as not to damage the preschool children was \u2014 was not \u2014 well, it was quite a problem. Still, much good was done over a difficult course. I worked for them for \u2014 for 10 years. It started in a real f \u2014 peculiar way. I mean, they had asked me to \u2014 to help, and I came as a volunteer, and then they wanted more help, and more help. And I said, listen, you guys, I can\u2019t spend all my time here, I have to make a living. And they said, do you want to do it as an outside person, or as a staff person? Well, having had the experience with USA television, where as an outside person I found it terribly hard, I said staff. And they said, well, what would it take to hire you? And I s\u2014mind you, I had really believed when I was first asked to do pro bono contributions that a-all the people working for this program were volunteers and it turned out that all of them were staff and I was a volunteer. So I became a staff person. And I remember in the beginning of my being a staff person, which meant somebody gave me a desk and a telephone, you know, and everything else was improvisation in the beginning, there was a writer who shared my office, as did indeed, five writers. But this particular one told me of his hardship that he was doing this as volunteer work and he hoped to get a job eventually, and that his children were hungry and neighbors were looking after them and so forth. And I said, you have to \u2014 you know, they are all so busy with what they are doing, they are not thinking of you and me. And I had to go and say, look, fish or cut bait. Interview with Peter Masters m September 25, 1998 Either you \u2014 or I can\u2019t come as much as you want me to come and work. And then they gave me a job. And he said, darn it, I\u2019m gonna do it. And he walked down to personnel and never came back. He had told them to hire him more or not and they said not. So e-e \u2014 these were rough days. I mean, you never knew what was going to \u2014 what was going to happen next. And \u2014 and we moved from place to place into improvised offices. And at the \u2014 at the times Shriver had two jobs, Peace Corps and poverty program and so on. But we did an enormous amount of good, I am quite convinced that some of the \u2014 the enthusiasm that was mustered, of you \u2014 you\u2019ve never seen government offices like that where people are really \u2014 I mean, they would work into the night and through the night for nothing, to get things out, get things done. It was a marvelous experience. Of course, there came the time 10 years later when the administration changed and the new one decided that there was no more poverty in the United States, along with many other myth, you know, I mean the \u2014 the perception that poverty is priv \u2014 predominantly Afro- American is quite false. It is by no means that. It 1s, percentage-wise there are poor \u2014 poor whites in \u2014 in \u2014 in Appalachia and \u2014 and not only in Appalachia. Because of the migration to the cities to find jobs for the \u2014 from \u2014 from the rural communities, and then the disillusionment when there aren\u2019t enough jobs, and living in city slums and so on, this 1s a syndrome that 1s true across the country. It is probably better now than it has been, which doesn\u2019t mean its \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s good. Interview with Peter Masters m September 25, 1998 But the awareness was, I think initiated \u2014 well, I don\u2019t want \u2014 I \u2014 I wanted to say by \u2014 by this program and \u2014 and it\u2019s not quite true, because of course, Roosevelt before has done \u2014 had done tremendous work. But that had begun to perhaps dissipate a bit, until it was revived by \u2014 by Johnson, who \u2014 who knew what it was like to be poor."

            "question": "Can I ask you to give me a time frame? When \u2014 what years \u2014",
            "answer": "Yeah, well, let\u2019s see, time frame. I worked for the Office of Economic Opportunity from October \u201964 to August \u201974, 10 years roughly. And then when \u2014 when there was supposedly no more poverty, we were dispersed and I was sent to the General Services Administration, which many perceived to be a fate worse than death. But by that time, having been in government for 10 years, I had inevitably become involved in some other battles, which is to make the government look better, which I think is terribly important. The government \u2014 you know, we \u2014 we tend to be cynical about what the government does, and the government does some things extremely well. Extremely well. And hides its \u2014 its light under a bushel, where \u2014 where you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t see what \u2014 how well they are doing certain things. I was al \u2014 I-I\u2019m not saying this is true of \u2014 of every aspect, but it\u2019s true of many of their functions. I remember when a \u2014 a thing was introduced in the general service administration, where \u2014 to help citizens with questions about government, which if you\u2019ve ever tried it by yourself, can be very, Interview with Peter Masters . September 25, 1998 very difficult. You call up and they say that\u2019s not in my job description, or the \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 doesn\u2019t belong here and it belongs over there and then you \u2014 you have a sheet of paper in front of you full of telephone numbers going down as you\u2019re being referred from one place to the other. Well, we in the General Service Administration at that time set out to \u2014 to \u2014 to end this kind of irritating obstacle course. And we had a \u2014 an \u2014 an office specializing in giving you the right answer and steering you the right way. And I was skeptical that this would work. So I called them up. They couldn\u2019t tell that I was calling from the same building, you know, and I asked \u2014 I\u2014 I got a young Afro-American woman on the phone, and I asked her a question which I knew she could not possibly know the answer, it was a complex question that required some research. And sh \u2014 she said, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t answer this right away. I will call you in half an hour with the answer. And I said, thank you very much, and I so \u2014 said to myself, yeah sure. In about 27 minutes she called me up with the right answer. Now, I was absolutely bowled over, because it \u2014 believe me, it was a difficult, tough question that she had to research and she did it with no complaints, no fuss. I was very impressed. Tha \u2014 tha \u2014 I hesitate to say that I believe the program no longer exists, and I wonder how easy it is now to get information. But it was a move in the right direction. When I say I\u2019m not sure it exists, I learned another big lesson 1-1-in \u2014 in \u2014 in government, and that is, I thought, when we had real progress, like by the poverty Interview with Peter Masters \u00e9 September 25, 1998 program, visible progress, or with an invention such as this answering of citizen\u2019s problems, you know, that there was no going back, that you could not \u2014 that no future administration would be foolish enough to go back to where, you know, it would continue to move forward. That\u2019s not true. They are not only going back at \u2014 to the \u2014 to the \u2014 to square one, they go to 50 years before square one, and there\u2019s some common syndromes that I came to observe. For instance, a person fro \u2014 appointed politically, either party, doesn\u2019t make any difference, to some office and heads maybe a department, maybe a division. Even smaller sub-units. You get the impression that the first thing they want to do is to write a letter home to mom to say I\u2019m not at the feet of the president, I have his ear. And whether they want to invent a new identity for this particular department, division, whatever, regardless that it\u2019s part of a bigger thing, the government, or if you want to go one step down, of \u2014 of \u2014 of one of the agencies of the government, 1t doesn\u2019t matter, they want their own identity. So they \u2014 for \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m speaking as a visual person. So all of a sudden you have all these things spring up, and their taste generally runs to the 19\" century, and not the 20\" because they haven\u2019t heard of what things look like in the 20\" century. But I\u2019m \u2014 when I\u2019m speaking visually, believe me that\u2019s symbolic of everything else, they \u2014 they tend to hark back to something they ha \u2014 heard of how things are, where, and they want to imitate, and since they are not necessarily chosen for being innovators, they tend to retard the pro \u2014 the progress Interview with Peter Masters \" September 25, 1998 and go back to, before it was when it was already outmoded. Well, that\u2019s how it is. So one has to be constantly alert, to keep things going forward. And people get really doing that at times. So \u2014 and I\u2019m not even mentioning politics, I\u2019m mentioning simply the bureaucratic process, which is unavoidable to \u2014 s-so it would seem, because innovators who are capable of not that common a specimen. Well, after many a fight, some of which I\u2019ve won, I di \u2014 for instance, I designed the building signs in the federal triangle that you still see where the newscasters stand in front of the thing that says Department of Justice, or U.S. Department of Agriculture, whatever. They are these vertical standing brownish colored things with very clear lettering, with a little bulge forward so you can read the title. And they are made of reinforced fiberglass. And I had to get those accepted by the fine arts commission. They were supposedly supposed to be a pilot program for all of Washington and then the whole country. The federal triangle being the experimental area. When I \u2014 when I presented it to the fine arts commission, they said, how long are these signs good for? And I said \u2014 I was about to say, oh, state of the art, they last long time, when Carter Brown, who was the chairman of the fine arts commission anticipated that and said, what we are afraid of is that they will last too long, because after 10 years our tastes will have changed and we\u2019ll get tired of looking at them, and they won\u2019t give us any money to do new ones if they\u2019re still good. So I said, they will last exactly 10 years. And two things Interview with Peter Masters . September 25, 1998 happened. One, they are still there after, I think, what is it? 25 years. And they are getting shabby, and still they are not replacing them. And secondly, it never happened that they were \u2014 that they were done all over th-the \u2014 the town, or all over the country. A few were done by the initiative of some agencies here and there, but never beyond that. I-It just \u2014 not because they didn\u2019t like them, not because they weren\u2019t good, they just didn\u2019t get around to it, to it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t follow if something is efficient and works that this plan \u2014 that this plan will be permitted."

            "question": "Excuse me, we have to pause so I can \u2014 we have to pause so I can change the tape. [break]. This is a continuation of a . This 1s a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape three, side B, and you were telling me about your professional career and I believe you left me around 1974.",
            "answer": "Yes. The \u2014 when \u2014 \u201974 \u2014I\u2019d gone slightly beyond that \u2014 was when the Office of Economic Opportunity ceased to exist and I was transferred to the General Service Administration and I had said that I had, by now, become a fighter for making the government look better to the s \u2014 to the citizen. And to try and introduce some, at least semblance of the 20\" century while it lasted, to the general population. Whereas everything tended to be done backwards, visually, I mean, a government department. When I did the signs in the federal triangle, I had Interview with Peter Masters \u201d September 25, 1998 to find a sign that would be compatible with the earlier tendency to make a government office look like a Greek temple, because why? A Greek temple is \u2014 is old and solid, and the government, like banks, built like Greek temples, as we used to do, were deemed to be more solid if they looked like a Greek temple. Well then came the \u2014 the craving for modernity, and we got the kind of new deal architecture of an empty \u2014 beginnings of the influences of Bauhaus in \u2014 in \u2014 in style. And that in turn led to a degree of Bauhaus fatigue. That you didn\u2019t want plain boxes that were functional. The idea of \u2014 of the Bauhaus being that if it\u2019s functional and \u2014 and \u2014 and simple, and 1-1 \u2014 and efficient, it 1s beautiful, and it does not require decoration. And I was brought up with that in art school, that simple, if it\u2019s functional, it\u2019s beautiful, okay? Now look what\u2019s happened since. We \u2014 because of the \u2014 what I call the Bauhaus fatigue, we started with arbitrary and often ugly decora \u2014 over decoration. We had put flying buttresses onto buildings as a sort of harking back to when we were building thi \u2014 Greek temples. And in post-modern you see arbitrary archways that lead nowhere, attached to buildings as \u2014 as decoration. And \u2014 a-and th-the answer, if any \u2014 no \u2014 I\u2014I-\u2014I\u2019m not suggesting there is an answer, the answer is that no matter what we have, the only constant thing is \u2014 is change. We are going to go to something else, because you want something else, and it doesn\u2019t mean that it is necessarily better than its predecessor. That would be nice, and \u2014 but again, like I was saying about \u2014 a- Interview with Peter Masters i September 25, 1998 about progress in government, I \u2014 you mustn\u2019t accept the notion that because the ultimate has been achieved, that it will therefore stay in \u2014 in \u2014 even in its \u2014 in its degree of quality. This is true in the arts. It\u2014 one could make one heck of an argument of saying that beyond Beethoven, you know, maybe we should have stopped there. Well, that\u2019s not fair, because look at some of the great things that have come to us since then. Whether they are better than the classic, the role models, is \u2014 1s arguable. Another thing is that \u2014 that today\u2019s art modern is tomorrow\u2019s classic. We had been talking before about the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and some of us were shocked when they came on the scene. And some of us now look upon these manifestations as classical, compared to hard rock, compared to where we are now. We are nostalgic for the Beatles and for Elvis Presley. You see? And it\u2019s amazing how you can apply this formula to all kinds of completely different things, as I have just done, and I can go beyond that, it is in \u2014 in the ci \u2014 Civil Rights Movement, which I embraced with great enthusiasm, having just been through six years of war to f\u2014 to fight against racism. And I would have arguments with people on all sides. I\u2019'd have arguments with some of my Afro- American friends who would say ha \u2014 I had an Afro-American partner with whom I had va \u2014 hardly any arguments, we were on the same wavelengths. But with some of them who said that the persecution of Afro-Americans was as bad as the Holocaust, and I would say th ho \u2014 ho \u2014 hold it, hold it right there. Interview with Peter Masters \" September 25, 1998 [indecipherable] I will agree with one thing, that if \u2014 1f you are running away from a lynch mob, it probably doesn\u2019t make any difference whether you\u2019re running from the Holocaust or from the lynch mob. But, apart from that, the notion that there is a federal program for your extermination and murder is different than even the collusion and permissiveness of a government that allows lynch mobs. That \u2014 this is not an advocacy of lynch mobs, obviously, but \u2014 but the point is, the idea that it was legislated to murder everybody. Men, women, children, old people, whatever, 1s unique. And therefore, the comparison does not hold, okay? I remember that when I was in t \u2014 in television, and my Afro- American assistant, who later became my partner when we both quit, wa \u2014 there was one sort of greasy spoon restaurant owned by a Greek man on the corner. The only place you could eat outside, before we had a cafeteria. Well, sometimes somebody would say, let\u2019s talk about next week\u2019s show over lunch at Frank\u2019s, that restaurant. And that meant that I would have to go, and my assistant could not go because of being Afro-American, they didn\u2019t serve black people in the restaurant. Which was embarrassing for me. I could either say let\u2019s not eat, which I wasn't always e-empowered to say, depending on who wanted to eat where and when. Mind you, they would sell my partner Joe sandwiches to take out. There was aS \u2014 back counter, and he would sometimes have to do that, because he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t have time to have a sandwich prepared at home Interview with Peter Masters ia September 25, 1998 \u2014 have to eat. And we worked around the clock often, you know, so I mean \u2014 came the Civil Rights Act in the 60s and I said, Joe, are you gonna eat at Frank\u2019s? And he said, I been thinking about that. And I said, well, I can see both sides of the argument. Why should you take your custom to a place that wouldn\u2019t serve you? In fact, the waitress, when the Civil Rights Act was passed, told me at the meeting that they \u2014 I think I\u2019m going to quit because we are going to have to serve niggers. And I made some remark saying, well I think it\u2019s time that that act was passed, you know. Well, Joe said, on the other hand, if I don\u2019t go in to eat at Joe\u2019s, what was the point of getting the Civil Rights Act? So he said, I think I will. On the other hand, he said, I will fully understand if some of my race do not go in to eat in restaurants that were segregated until yesterday, because \u2014 and here comes the important sentence \u2014 not everybody can be a pioneer. And I think that\u2019s true. I think that there are people who are willing to fight and to be confrontational, and tell people, who say I\u2014I-\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to that. And you can try and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and influence people, but basically it is also true that some people are pioneers and some people are not. You need the pioneers and you must accept that there are some people who are not. So, when we got into subsequent discussions, I remember some people I considered racist in the poverty program, saying, you know, we\u2019d come out of the building from work and there would be some news headlines out in the street, and they would say that Stokey Carmichael, or Rap Interview with Peter Masters ia September 25, 1998 Brown, aren\u2019t they awful troublemakers, what have you. Now, Martin Luther King, that\u2019s a different proposition. And I said, aren\u2019t you forgetting that that\u2019s how you looked at Martin, until the more extreme Stokey Carmichaels and Rap Brown came on the scene, by which the \u2014 yesterdays revolutionary becomes the classicist, just like we were saying in the arts, or in other things, you see? They \u2014 the extreme of today makes the extreme of yesterday the conservative. In fact, sometimes pathetically so. And \u2014 and that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how \u2014 ho-how that played, and it was an ongoing \u2014 an ongoing discussion, and I feel that it has progressed. But one thing we learned in the poverty program is that we were trying to redress past wrongs. If you ask the redressee, have we redressed wrongs enough, the answer is inevitably that we have barely scratched the surface. That leads to someone wanting to put on the brakes, if only for political reasons, because if you are doing something that is unpopular with the general public because they say you are redressing too much, and unpopular with the redressees, because they say you are not redressing enough, you are losing on both sides. You are losing politically and you are losing the things you are setting out to do. So, you have a very, very, very serious problem, and you inevitably begin to repress a bit together with redressing. In other words, when you put the brakes on redressing wrongs, you are repressing th-the people. By that I mean you are denying them some of the redressing they would like to have, because they \u2014 you \u2014 you can\u2019t do as much as Interview with Peter Masters \u2122 September 25, 1998 they want you to do. So, this \u2014 the rather delicate balance between redressing and repressing \u2014 and by repressing I don\u2019t mean any \u2014 any acts of \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of keeping somebody down, I\u2019m merely calling it the insufficient redressing which is perceived as repression, all right? So when you do this \u2014 this \u2014 this delicate balance. You come to the point where it\u2019s almost impossible to walk the tightrope and your political opponents will scream bloody murder that you are redressing too much. And then you have protesters outside your building saying you are not redressing enough. Now, Shriver had a great talent for this, he would go down on the sidewalk to the protesters, invite them to his office and sit down with them and reason with them. His successors barricaded themselves in the building, stopped the elevator service, which again illustrates the misconception that things that move forward continue to move forward, they don\u2019t. Well, I found that 1-1n \u2014 in some ways progression continues to progress, perhaps. An example that comes to mind is anti-Semitism which probably belongs here. When I first came to this country and \u2014 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in the \u2014 the end of the 40s, the beaches around Washington had signs saying Gentiles only. Not whites only, Gentiles only. And it was in \u2014 understood without saying that that meant white Gentiles, okay? And there was Father Coughlin and there was Bilbo up on the hill spouting anti- Semitism and the likes of which we have mercifully forgotten, how blatant and \u2014 and \u2014 and crude that anti-sin \u2014 Semitism wa \u2014 seemed acceptable on the floor of Interview with Peter Masters = September 25, 1998 the house. Now, shall we say that has become unfashionable, or deemed primitive, whatever, I don\u2019t know. And I find it difficult to picture that it would return in totality. Perhaps there\u2019s some elements of the extreme so-called religious right that would like to revive those days. I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t admit it at this point, because as I say, it\u2019s unfashionable, and recognized to be primitive, which I think is a good thing. But we shouldn\u2019t delude ourselves that there aren\u2019t places where the attitude exists. I find it exists in \u2014 in Europe to a \u2014 to a considerable extent, more overtly than in \u2014 in the United States now. I was told yesterday by a man who told me that his father was a Nazi, that there is m \u2014 that in Germany, even though there is this movement of \u2014 of \u2014 of the young who \u2014 who \u2014 who abhor their Nazi past, or the Nazi past of their parents, and this man abhors the Nazi past of his father, but he says his father was unemployed, and he was an engineer and he was repairing radios to make a living of sorts. And when Hitler came to power he got a job as an engineer. So he thought that \u2014 he \u2014 he said, what they are doing to the Jews is \u2014 that\u2019s bad, bad. But look what it has done for me. And von Stauffenberg, who tried to assassinate Hitler 1s considered a traitor by one and all, by the vast majority of people. I found that shocking, I didn\u2019t know that, I thought \u2014 and I still believe there are segments of the people who consider him a resistance person. This \u2014 this man told me that there isn\u2019t a single memorial or monument to Stauffenberg, because vast majority of people consider him a Interview with Peter Masters \"\u00b0 September 25, 1998 traitor. Now, I\u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014I\u2014I find that \u2014 I mean, that came as a shock. I did not know that. I thought that the disillusionment with Hitler and \u2014 and by saying disillusionment I\u2019m implying that there was an illusionment before, and \u2014 and there certainly was. And some of it, if you will understand the burden, like the man who didn\u2019t have a job that got a job, like the peculiar historic situation where you have a German Reich that was 90 years old. Before that there were duchies and principalities of \u2014 of Munich, Saxony, whatever. Prussia. And that after losing World War I, there was \u2014 first of all, it was kept intact, as opposed to the Austro-Hungarian empire, which was 2,000 years old and was completely chopped up because of the ethnic elements, all of whom had been caught in this thing we just mentioned about th-th-the tightrope between repression and redressing, because if an Austrian emperor or Austrian government tried to redress the demands of the Hungarians, or the Serbs, or the Czechs, it was politically unpopular at home and deemed insufficient by the recipients of the programs, who wanted out, never mind how and just sooner better than later. As indeed we are now seeing in Bosnia and in all these places where small minorities, whether they are viable or not, completely not caring about whether they can form a viable entity, want to be nationalistically independent. Even the most reasonable among them, and I have talked to some of the most reasonable, will say that first we must have our independence and then we can attempt to confederate. In the meantime, Interview with Peter Masters \" September 25, 1998 the process of getting that independence is bloody and \u2014 and destructive. And unreasonable. And \u2014 and there\u2019s nothing we seem to be able to do about it because we don\u2019t necessarily progress. Now, in Germany, this \u2014 this relatively recent empire of \u2014 of \u2014 of 90 year old confederation, they yearned to be powerful again. Understandably, the Austro-Hungarians never had any dream of becoming a powerful empire again, because that would mean gluing together the thing where the glue hadn\u2019t held, o-of \u2014 of \u2014 of ethnic minorities, you see? So they never had that ambition, except perhaps in the case of some Austrians who were pan \u2014 pan- German thinkers, and thought as part of the German empire, they could see some greatness again. But I wouldn\u2019t say there were many until Hitler demonstrated that that dream of be \u2014 of \u2014 of \u2014 of regaining power for this German entity could be realized, in that he was immensely successful politically and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and militarily. And took over one country after the other, right? And if your victorious armies are marching into country after country with a minimum of casualties, and asserting themselves as \u2014 as the masters of the world, it\u2019s probably hard for the average citizen not to stand and cheer at \u2014 at the sidelines, when all that technological hardware is rolling past you and \u2014 and the pageantry, at which they were very good. They were very, very skilled in visual pageantry. Well, the \u2014 I see a bridge here to something else we wanted to cover, which is Vietnam. The bridge is this; when the Vietnam situation started, I, after my six years of war and being Interview with Peter Masters = September 25, 1998 an officer in the British army, in an elite unit, thought that that was the reasonable thing to do. I thought that the domino theory, which had been demonstrated by Hitler, that is you don\u2019t stop him when he first occupies the Rhineland, then he will occupy Austria, Czechoslovakia and then continue the rest of western Europe, all right? If you \u2014 what you should have done, clearly, was to stop him when he occupied the Rhineland. Well, the parallels seemed obvious. The big threat now was communism. If they took over Vietnam and one didn\u2019t stop them there, they would take over the rest of southeast Asia. And not necessarily as a popular movement, but as a enslaving kind of mechanism. Well, true or false, right? What subsequently changed my mind, not very long after, was the painful realization that just before \u2014 because you are right \u2014 and even that, of course, becomes \u2014 is arguable, but even if you perceive yourself to be right, you can\u2019t undertake things that are \u2014 that you\u2019re going to lose. It\u2019s impractical. So for pragmatic reasons if nothing else, the idea of subduing communism in Vietnam, which turned out to be a popular nationalistic movement, if you are going to \u2014 to fight a losing war, the answer obviously is don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t go in the first place. That means admitting that you can\u2019t do it. And \u2014 and that takes a lot \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s sometimes harder to do for a head of state to say, we think we ought to be doing this, but we can\u2019t. It\u2019s harder to do than to say okay, go. A-And then afterwards, when you have enormous numbers of people killed and \u2014 and maimed, there 1s, of Interview with Peter Masters i September 25, 1998 course, no \u2014 no easy way back. You \u2014 you can\u2019t bring them back. But, in a sense, those who were afraid of a domino theory had their \u2014 their fears borne out to a considerable extent. After awhile when \u2014 when \u2014 when communism itself became the image of a failed methodology, the whole thing seems redundant. I mean, what communism were we afraid of? Russian communism, Chinese communism. Well, Russian communism as \u2014 1s \u2014 1-1s \u2014 1s gone. Chinese communism 1s metamorphosing in all \u2014 into all kinds of other things. Whether we are justifiably afraid of that now, is really, A, it \u2014 it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t apply in the same sense as it applied at that time. And there were probably a couple of other factors in there. I think that we are still in this country resentful of the former colonial powers, because after all, we were under British rule, and so, if the British were pushed out of the Persian gulf, that didn\u2019t really hurt us. I-If the French were pushed out of Vietnam, Indochina, that \u2014 we were gonna do it better. We were gonna show them that 1-1t spilt \u2014 the failure was because they were colonial powers. Well, our trying to get into these things with limited experience and assume a pseudo- colonial role in c \u2014 in \u2014 1n countries 1-in the Persian gulf, or in \u2014 in \u2014 1n\u20141in southeast Asia, hasn\u2019t worked out too well. And \u2014 because the world is readjusting itself and \u2014 and the \u2014 yesterday\u2019s methods progressed as na \u2014 as \u2014 it begins to be questionable whether progress 1s progress as we perceive it. And also, it doesn\u2019t necessarily go forward. It goes \u2014 I-I would think that if you asked people the \u2014 the Interview with Peter Masters \" September 25, 1998 academic question whether they would prefer the Persian gulf to be as it was, which means playing footsy with the shah, who was not necessarily a democratic leader, we\u2019d probably happily settle for that at \u2014 at this moment, instead of what we ve got. What can you do? I-It \u2014 the \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and as for the \u2014 the non- viable mini-states that spring up as nationalist units, the example of Slovakia having split off from Czech Republic, because they felt that they were treated like underdogs, with justification. But, by themselves much less viable, and I\u2019m sure that a great many of them are sorry that they split off. There 1s no visible easy way back to that confederation, that comes after the national thing, as I have been told, you know. No easy way back. So we are \u2014 we are perpetually shooting ourselves in the foot all over, I mean, not you and I, but people everywhere, in their own situations. [break]"

And you had told me about your professional career, and you told me about the social changes that you saw in this country in the 60s and into the 70s. But you haven\u2019t spoken to me about your personal life and your family. Can you tell me about your family? Interview with Peter Masters \" September 25, 1998",
            "answer": "Well, I came, if you recall, from \u2014 from England on a Fulbright and sterling \u2014 pounds sterling were not convertible, so I had no money. And the art schools were not boarding schools, so I lived at International House in New York at 500 Riverside Drive. And that was very stimulating because there were students from all over, and many friends, which I maintain to this day. Some of them I haven\u2019t \u2014 I hadn\u2019t seen in, I guess almost 50 years, but my friendships are of the nature that I can pick them up any time as if there had been no time gap. We had recently been to Hawaii, where I had friends from International Student House whom I hadn\u2019t seen since. And it worked like we had never parted. I \u2014 one day, a Greek student in New York who lived at the house, said let\u2019s hitchhike to Washington. I\u2019m going to hitchhike to Washington, anybody want to come along? I said sure. I \u2014 I\u2019ve never been there, and I know somebody in Washington. Let me try and telephone and see whether I can arrange something. So I did what in those days was an unusual activity, a long distance telephone call. And I went and called Washington, and | had no address of the person I was looking for, who had been the fianc\u00e9e of a friend of mine who was a commando colleague in \u2014 in England and in Normandy, we b-both went in on the same team to Normandy, and we were very, very close friends. And we double dated in England. I was engaged to an Irish girl from northern Ireland. Have we covered that before? Well, the \u2014 his fianc\u00e9e was \u2014 had come out on the ch \u2014 ki \u2014 children\u2019s transport from Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters \u201d September 25, 1998 Czechoslovakia and had work in London for the Czech government in exile until the coup in Czechoslovakia when she lost her job. She had been alone to the second international conference, annual conference of the International Monetary Fund, and they had offered her a job in Washington. And when she lost her job in London, she accepted the job in Washington, because why not, for a year, and had \u2014 in other words, come for a year at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. I couldn\u2019t remember the name of the International Monetary Fund and I first asked th-the Washington telephone operator whether I \u2014 she had a listing by name, and she didn\u2019t. So I said well, there\u2019s an organization that belongs to the United Nations. And she said, the United Nations are in Flushing Meadows, New York. And I said, I know that, but there 1s some branch, it\u2019s called the United Nations Fund, or the United Nations bank, or something. And she said, sir, United Nations are in Flushing Meadows, Long Island, New York. After we\u2019d been over that a couple of times, I said, I tell you what, forget it, and I hung up. Obviously I wasn't going to get anywhere and I went to see the Greek student who had wanted to hitchhike to Washington, and I said, I\u2019m having problems about this Washington thing, I can\u2019t reach my party. And he said, I\u2019ve decided not to go. I said okay, it\u2019s off. So it didn\u2019t happen. Awhile later, Alice went to London on home leave, London being her home, and met with our mutual friend and \u2014 and other friends from the commandos. And they said, oh, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters \" September 25, 1998 when you go back through New York, you must bring this book that is just out to Peter. The book was \u201cThe Green Beret,\u201d the first book about the commandos by Hilary Saint George Saunders, a historian. And she had said, oh, Peter is in New York? I didn\u2019t know that. And she brought me the book. Now, I \u2014 I have to go back a moment and say that when she left for \u2014 for Washington from London, her fianc\u00e9 said to me, I have \u2014 he was in business already and I was in art school \u2014 he said, I have a shipment coming in in the docks, and I can\u2019t take off, I have to be there. But you are an art student, you can take time off. Why don\u2019t you go with her to \u2014 whatever it was, Cooks, and help her make the arrangements? Anyone who knows Alice knows that she needed my help like the hole in the head. She \u2014 when she worked for the International Monetary Fund, she made travel arrangements for 60 people, and my helping her was a laugh. But I took time off and went down the road to Cooks on Southampton Row, King\u2019s Way, which was five minutes from my school, and gave her, as \u2014 as a matter of fact, a going away present of one of my little Ashanti gold weights that I had acquired during my six months in Africa at the end of the war. And she brought me the book and I told her the story about how I had almost come to Washington and she said, well, you must come and see Washington. And I said sure. And of course, having no money, I hitchhiked. Holland tunnel or whatever, and in those days, if you got a ride straight through it took seven and a half hours, and you never got a ride straight through, so it took Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Peter Masters \" September 25, 1998 10 - 11 - 12 hours. And I would start at \u2014 after school, about four o\u2019clock, and \u2014 and hitchhike. There was, of course, no New Jersey turnpike. There was no bridge over the Delaware. There was a ferry. There was no tunnel under Baltimore and no route 95, but route one with traffic lights and what have you. I usually hit Baltimore in the early hours of the morning, like two o\u2019clock a-and \u2014 and usually on a truck which dropped me off somewhere in the harbor district. And on one occasion, two potential muggers followed me and in fact I \u2014 I had a suitcase and a portfolio to carry, so they could walk faster than I could, and they \u2014 I \u2014 I decided I w \u2014 I would \u2014 I would walk in the middle of the road so I wouldn\u2019t be pulled in anywhere, and I stopped and they came and said, at two in the morning, and asked me for a light. And I said, I don\u2019t smoke. Is there anything else you want? And I had a metal suitcase which I held, which I was going to throw at them and run, if necessary. And they decided that this was not a good proposition and they decided not to \u2014 to mug me. And \u2014 but it was an unpleasant incident and looked very threatening. And a \u2014 another story that comes to mind is it \u2014 one time it poured, and it was just before Alice\u2019s birthday and I was \u2014 I had bought her ano \u2014 a new umbrella, and it was gift wrapped. And I carried that umbrella gift wrapped and wouldn\u2019t open it because I didn\u2019t want to spoil the thing, I carried it under my jacket so it wouldn\u2019t get wet. Anyway, after hitchhiking to Washington a few times, w-we met in New York and in Washington. And in the following spring, Interview with Peter Masters \u00b0 September 25, 1998 1950, we were married. And Alice had arranged some interviews for me in Washington to find a job, and the person who was going to help me find the job ran a small public relations agency, and he desired \u2014 he si \u2014 he decided that he would hire me himself and call it public relations and advertising and I was the art director of this small outfit, and it was not an altogether positive experience. I think I earned 30 dollars a week and that was low even by the standards of that time. But I had quite some exposure. I did three full color ads for \u201cEsquire\u201d magazine and I found that I had to solicit some of the jobs because nobody else seemed to be doing it and after awhile everybody quit and I was the only employee. But one of them had preceded me into television and he offered me a \u2014 a job in television. We\u2019ve \u2014 may have covered that before. Anyway, in the meantime, A-Alice and I had moved into a one room apartment on \u2014 on Belmont Street in Washington, which was rather \u2014 rather primitive, but not \u2014 not at all bad, and after a period we moved downtown into an air conditioned apartment. That was the height of luxury. Small one, also. And we had our first child, a daughter, Anne, who from a very early age wanted to do professionally exactly what I was doing and \u2014 and helped me, even as a child. And got very proficient and became a good graphic designer and is one to this day. Then we had a second daughter, Kim, who also \u2014 all of them leaned in directions that I had marginally been involved in. She started to write poetry, which we have done traditionally in my Interview with Peter Masters \"\u00b0 September 25, 1998 family for every birthday. And of course, she went beyond that and she became a writer and is at this stage a contributing editor to \u201cVanity Fair\u201d and \u201cTime\u201d magazine, and is writing her second book, called tentatively, \u201cKeys to the Kingdom,\u201d meaning Michael Eisner and the Disney operation. That\u2019s big league writing, not the sort of thing that \u2014 that I\u2019m doing. Well, as \u2014 this morning, as a matter of fact, in looking for a certain book, I came across the album of \u2014 of birthday cards over the years, and it\u2019s quite a collection because they are both graphics and \u2014 and \u2014 and at least doggerel verse, and it\u2019s a heartwarming memento that I \u2014 I \u2014 I think 1-I \u2014 astonished me because I had forgotten some of them, they\u2019ve been so long ago. But the tradition goes on. The tradition also goes on to my third child which \u2014 Tim, a \u2014 a\u2014a son who works for the Discovery Channel as senior manager of special events, and lives only five minutes from my house. And he writes absolutely beautiful birthday poets \u2014 poems. Everybody knows what birthday poems sound like and I sometimes wince at the bad meter and \u2014 and the suggested ego trip of all of us who do this. But my daughter Kim and my son Tim, write absolutely gorgeous ones, far better than anything I\u2019ve ever done. And incidentally, my children being named Anne, Kim and Tim, the last one was Kim\u2019s idea, together with the support of her older sister. And we said, if we call him Tim and we calling you \u2014 him \u2014 or we call you, you will never know which one we are calling because it sounds alike. And she said, that\u2019s the idea. A-As you Interview with Peter Masters \"t September 25, 1998 can see where she comes from. Well, they\u2019re all married. Anne is married to an architect and lives in Washington and has three children; David, who 1s now 11, Sam, who is nine and Hannah who is almost six. And Kim had great trouble \u2014 she is married to Gary Simpson, who is in television, movies in Hollywood. She \u2014 Kim moved to Hollywood because she covers Hollywood. She used to work for the \u201cWashington Post\u201d for many years for style, but now she doesn\u2019t work for a papers, she writes the book and contributes articles to those two publications. She had great difficulty having a baby. She had 10 in-vitros attempting to have a baby, all failed. And ultimately succeeded by having a \u2014 a surrogate carry her child. The baby is hers and her husband\u2019s, implanted into a surrogate, who carried it and it\u2019s now a few months old, a little girl. And the \u2014 one thing that comes to mind is when she and the surrogate were together in the hospital for the birth of the baby, the baby cried during the night, and Kim said, the baby is crying. And the surrogate mother said, it\u2019s not my baby, you go and take care of it. And she has been doing that happily ever since. Took some adjustment, because when you don\u2019t carry the baby, the impact on your life, whe \u2014 which suddenly changes without the relief of not carrying it any more is \u2014 1s quite an experience, that I hadn\u2019t really anticipated. But she adjusted to it very well, and now all is going very well. And as we sit here and speak, Tim and his wife Laurie, who also works for Discovery cable television, she is vice-president in charge of marketing, expect their first baby. The Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 phone could ring now. I know we\u2019 ve turned them off, but even so, and she might be having that baby. We don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a boy or a girl, any \u2014 any day now. The \u2014 all three children, by the way, went to school in \u2014 in this area, in the Washington area, and all three of them didn't like high school, and wanted to get out as soon as possible. So, 1t was possible in the district to take, I don\u2019t know, English four and I forget what else, math, over the summer and graduate early. All three of them did that. You didn\u2019t have to be brilliant to graduate early, just had to take a couple of summer courses. And they wanted to avoid the graduation ceremony, none of them wanted to go through it, peculiarly perhaps, and all of them wanted out. And all of them \u2014 each one of them did something different with the year they gained by graduating a year early. Anne worked for a design studio before she went to art school. She had helped me all along. And after a period of good experience, went to Pratt in \u2014 in New York, and was in many ways ahead, because she had the practical experience. And this was in a period when practicality was not big in the art schools. You know, they would say, design a logo for \u2014 design a logo for a \u2014 an \u2014 and use \u2014 draw it on a brick. If that sounds absurd, that was \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m doing this on purpose, or a cinder block, because that was characteristic of the time. Practicality was not the main thing. You did things that were impractical, but original, okay? It was the post-modern I talked to you about before. Well, so that was how she spent her year that she gained. Kim did Interview with Peter Masters \u201d September 25, 1998 something entirely different. She went to visit my wife\u2019s sister in London. And in London the county council runs all kinds of courses, which are affordable and very, very good. So she learned \u2014 she took courses in all the things she might want to be interested in later, having no idea where she was going to go. She took one in psychology, one in ceramics, one in Italian, one in drama, and I forget what else. And after she was through, she decided none of the above, and she became an English major, and now it became very important at what school she was to continue. And one of my colleagues on \u2014 a very senior older person in the poetry program, had been a president of Bryn Mawr, and she \u2014 and when I talked about the program said, oh Kim absolutely must go to Bryn Mawr and she took her there. And there was a sort of a \u2014 it really fitted Kim like \u2014 like a glove. There is a traditional Poet Laureate in Bryn Mawr who is anonymous un \u2014 and writes under the name of Applebee, which was the name of the gym teacher who introduced hockey to schools in the United States. And Applebee is selected by the outgoing Applebee after submissions of sample poems. And nobody knows who it is, and they write snide poems about \u2014 well, critical of \u2014 of \u2014 of the school management or whatever, or social gossip bu \u2014 and with \u2014 with double entendres galore. And Kim became Applebee in her junior year, I think. And the \u2014 the \u2014 I \u2014 I even recall the interview because Kim had read more books than anybody I know, and sh \u2014 before she went to college. And when you go for an interview they want to see 100 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 your reading list. And she went to Cornell and they looked at her reading list, which was a \u2014 a foldout, a-a \u2014 it was so long, and said, about what we would expect and that offended Kim deeply because she knew it wasn\u2019t true. It was a putdown, you see. And at Bryn Mawr, when she showed her reading list, the interviewer put it aside after glancing at it and said yes, but what is your favorite \u2014 who is your favorite author? And Kim said, without hesitation, Jane Austen. And the interviewer said, she is mine too, let\u2019s talk about Jane Austen. They talked for three hours about Jane Austen. So there\u2019s no question she was going to go anywhere else. Tim used his extra year to take an internship in television, because he had been interested 1n \u2014 in radio and television from being a \u2014 a toddler. In fact, in his house hangs a picture of him with his first phonograph when he was about four years old, and he is carefully putting down the needle, and subsequently worked as a disc jockey for the university of dis \u2014 dis \u2014 District of Columbia station. He had a program called Jazzmasters with Tim Masters. And when C- Span bought the station and there was no more jazz, the hearts of all the listeners bled, because they were so attached to that classical jazz program. And he misses it. He did it for, I think 12 years, as a sideline, unpaid. But he has been in \u2014 in some form of \u2014 of broadcasting all \u2014 all his life. Well, where were we? Yes, my wife Alice, who came for a year, stayed for 36 years. She became an administrative officer, and her \u2014 by now there are few people left who remember 101 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 her, but there are some, and when we go there for some function, or if we meet somebody by chance, she would \u2014 was literally a legend in that organization, because having been a \u2014 a \u2014 from a children\u2019s transport, you know, and having been self reliant from an early teenage age, she was so protective of the people working on the staff, that she would tell newly arrivals that the first thing they\u2019d have to do 1s to start thinking of their careers in terms of security and retirement and so on. And very few people \u2014 very few young people think about that at all. And now there are many \u2014 there are many out there who are thanking her for her being so solicitous. And she is a most remarkable person. She is a \u2014 a \u2014 the \u2014 the fastest at many things that I can \u2014 that I\u2019ve ever seen. I mean, if I\u20141if we go shopping and I get out of the car and I can\u2019t see where she 1s, it is because she is already in the house, having carried 50 percent of the bags and dinner is almost ready. You know, that sort of thing. And she never hesitated to have a social life, to \u2014 to invite people, while she was working. And how \u2014 how 1s \u2014 1s \u2014 by today\u2019s standards, unimaginable. And \u2014 and I \u2014 I don\u2019t think \u2014 I mean, some of my children have to have \u2014 have dinner party, what have you. But to think of the kind of dinner party she would have fo-for friends after she came home from work, and it was ready and delicious at the time when you didn\u2019t think she had hung up her coat yet. It\u2019s just a very special talent. When we were recently visiting friends on Cape Cod, we had an engagement to which we had to go, I\u2019ll come back to that 102 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 later, and we were going to have dinner afterwards, at our guests\u2019. And we had been talking about a continent-ental dessert that is \u2014 is a big favorite in central and eastern Europe. And in central and eastern Europe it\u2019s a dessert \u2014 it\u2019s a dumpling, either with plums or apricots. But she has figured out that it\u2019s better with peaches, because there\u2019s more fruit and the peaches are so good 1n this country, and in \u2014 particularly this year, by the way. So, she said, I\u2019m going to make that for dessert. And they said, well do it afterwards, because we really have to go. And she said, it won\u2019t take a minute. She had du-dumplings for five people ready while the others were putting on their jackets to go to the function. And so when we came back, all she had to do is put them in the water, and they were done, you know, I mean none \u2014 none of them could believe that she had actually accomplished that in this extremely narrow time span. Doesn\u2019t bother her [indecipherable]. And she has become a most valued counselor for my activities, which of course means particularly the book I have written. And the reason I wrote that book is because I felt that as the interest in the Holocaust and in World War II revived, people were writing books and telling stories that were horrible, and in recounting their \u2014 their stories, and I felt that someone ought to stress the fact that not everybody went like sheep to the slaughter, but some of us had the fortunate opportunity to be able to fight back. So I \u2014 and 1n addition, I wanted to commemorate all those who were less lucky that I was, because a lot of my refugee friends who succeeded in ha \u2014 in 103 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 \u2014 in doing special and hazardous duty, were killed or maimed or at least wounded. I was one of the lucky ones that came through without a scratch except a tiny grenade splinter in my rear end that I threw myself in house clearing, by being a little cowboy-like \u2014 cavalier about how I tossed the grenade. Which was partly encouraged by the management to be a little macho. Came with the job. So, I wrote my first book as a septuagenarian. It took me years and years to do it, because I had no idea how one writes a book. But I\u2019d always had the inclination to tell stories, as you can tell from this interview. So I \u2014I first wrote \u2014 I tried to do it by tape recording while walking the dog when I\u2019d had a heart attack. And I \u2014 my children ga-gave \u2014 borrowed somebody\u2019s dog or something, a very ugly Dalmatian. And I had to walk this dog twice a day, and they gave me a tape recorder and they said, that way you can get your \u2014 the book you always talk about, written. And I recorded while walking the dog. You can hear cars going by and stuff. And then I tried to get it transcribed, because I can\u2019t type. And I found several people who said they would do it, and they had two common denominators. One, they were very expensive, and two, they were absolutely incompetent at understanding what I was saying, perhaps because of my accent, perhaps because there are many proper nouns in there that they were unfamil \u2014 that were unfamiliar to them. And I struggled. I tried to transcribe it myself, I found I couldn\u2019t do it. So some friend said, you got to get yourself a word 104 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 processor and I did. It\u2019s a very primitive machine, a word processor and the printer. And I struggled to learn it and found that every now and again it would absolutely balk and not do what I told it to do. So I needed to call friends to help me to get it going again, to jumpstart it. And I found that this happened so often, that one friend wouldn\u2019t do it, I couldn\u2019t bother the same person, so I alternated about three friends and called them with my emergencies, in the middle of the night at times, because I couldn\u2019t stop, I had to go on. And that \u2014 that \u2014 with their patience and my persistence, that seemed to work. And then I talked to some publishers without submitting it, but I \u2014 I submitted, I think a synopsis to one in England, with whom I met and he said, you know, it doesn\u2019t all have to be true. And that finished it as far as I was concerned, because that was precisely my purpose, that it should all be true. H-He said, you know, faction is acceptable. And I \u2014 as long as you have a thrill on every page. I thought there were enough thrills without having to invent them. So we parted before we even started. And then I \u2014 I went to various people for advice and some of the advice was good and some of it was \u2014 was not. Some people said, you must have more dialog, some people said you must have less dialog. Some people said you must be sequential. And I think that\u2019s true. People want to know how it continues."

            "question": "Speaking of continuing, I have to pause to change the tape. Just one moment. [break] This is an continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 105 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 volunteer collection interview with Peter Masters. This is tape four, side B, and you were telling me about your book, and the genesis of your book. Let me first ask you, can you give me the title of your book?",
            "answer": "The book is called, \u201cStriking Back.\u201d I \u2014 I literally polled some of my commando friends and other people for a title and they made all kinds of suggestions. I can\u2019t pin down where the title ultimately came from, except perhaps i-in discussion between the publisher and myself, and utilizing, and re \u2014 rattling off all the names that have been suggested. And the publisher wrote the subtitle modified from something that I suggested, namely, it\u2019s called \u201cStriking Back: A Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazis.\u201d I wanted to say Jewish refugee commandos, but they said, the word refugee has a different connotation nowadays and people wouldn\u2019t know what it means in this context. And besides, it\u2019s too long. So there it is, a Jewish refugees war against the Nazis. And a \u2014 well, how did I find a publisher and be \u2014 believe me, people have asked me since, how do you get a book published, like I\u2019m the expert. And of course I \u2014 first time author, and I \u2014 what do I know\u201d? So, the \u2014 the way \u2014 the way this came about was that the historian Stephen Ambrose, who was the head of the \u2014 president of the Eisenhower Institute in New Orleans, and professor at the University of Louisiana in New Orleans, and the D-Day Museum in New Orleans, called together D-Day veterans from \u2014 mostly from the U.S. forces, but some from \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 106 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 from England and one from Germany. And \u2014 people who had experienced D- Day. And a friend in New York, Harry Nomberg(ph) called me, he was a commando friend, he served under the name of Harry Drew, and he said, my wife and I are going, why don\u2019t you come with Alice? And we decided we\u2019d all go. And we had work sessions and it was absolutely fascinating because you could talk to people who had been involved in some other activity on D-Day that I had seen but never fully understood. And now you could ask questions, how did you do this? How did these rocket firing craft work that were on our left, and so on. And we all submitted a tape beforehand and Ambrose told me that he liked mine am \u2014 and considered it to be among his best. And we \u2014 and then he wrote the book, D-Day, which became a best seller and my story is in there in multiple installments about my D-Day experience. So I mentioned to him that I we \u2014 was \u2014 I wanted to write a book, for the reasons I\u2019ve already stated. And he said, you must absolutely. And I said, don\u2019t I need an agent? And he said, yes you do, why don\u2019t you use mine? And he recommended me to his agent in New York, and that didn\u2019t work out at all, because the man told me on th \u2014 I never met him, but the man told me on the phone that he was suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and it would be quite some time before he got around to reading my book, because he \u2014 he couldn\u2019t in his present condition. That was very discouraging. Secondly \u2014 I mean, I had notions that I\u2019d get it out for the 50\" anniversary of D-Day, and it \u2014 I 107 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 was clearly not going to make it. Then he said, it will require extensive editing, and he recommended an editor to me, who said he charged 250 dollars an hour. And I said, I can\u2019t afford for you to read my book, leave alone to edit it. And we made a \u2014 an agreement that I would pay him an amount for giving me advice, after reading some of the book. And he gave me some advice, some of it good, some of it I discarded, which was to be anticipated. Then a man published a book about my overall unit, that is a\u2014 my \u2014 my commando unit, in which I was fortunate enough to \u2014 to be able to strike back. It was number three troop, 10 commando. The 10 commando had two French troops, a Dutch troop, a Norwegian troop, a Polish troop. I think we\u2019ve been through that. And he wrote about all of us, you know, so we were one chapter in that book. And this man had done considerable research and was familiar with all the dramatis personae. So I told \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 he offered to help me edit, and \u2014 and to advise me. And in return, he was writing additional books on the SOE, special operations of the U.S. \u2014 of the allied forces, and he needed research done at the National Archives, because it didn\u2019t exist in England. So I did the research for him for days on end, and found very interesting things that he could use in his book and in return he \u2014 we exchanged tapes and he advised me. When I told Stephen Ambrose that he and \u2014 that I \u2014 I didn\u2019t get along with his agent, he said, oh, I haven\u2019t used him in years. But naturally it didn\u2019t occur to him to, you know, to \u2014 to call me and say I didn't use \u2014 I don\u2019t use that agent any 108 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 more. And he said, well, there are several options, and one of the ideas that came up was that I should talk to the people at the Holocaust Museum. And I talked to Mr. Aronowitz at the Holocaust Museum, who had been in publishing in a previous life, and he said, tell you what Pll do. I-I will print out publishers who I think would be interested in your book. Now, they won\u2019t all be big publishers, some of them specialize in military memoirs and that\u2019s probably a prime consideration. And he printed out the list and the top publisher on the list was Presidio Press in California, and I sent them \u2014 a-and Mr. Aronowitz advised me that the way to do it was to telephone and ask for the acquisition editor. Now, the average first time author doesn\u2019t know that, and sends it blind. Well, I sent it to the acquisition editor and got a letter back saying we are interested in your book. First publisher I submitted it to. And they accepted the book, they said they print 20 volumes a year, and they get 1600 submissions. And before the book was printed, it was ti\u2014 the movie options were bought by Miramax. And recently the German translation options were bought by a German publisher, whom I\u2019m trying to contact to offer my services in case they need any help, because I want to make sure that it\u2019s done right. Now, the book has totally changed my life. As a first time septuagenarian author, I am being asked to speak here, there and everywhere and to give book talks. The story I told you about the fruit dumplings, the commitment to which we were not to be late was at the Eldredge Library in Chatham on Cape 109 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 Cod. And this is a retiree audience, by no means Jewish, and they were a marvelous audience. And I spoke for about an hour, and then I \u2014 we had a book signing at the bookstore about three houses away. And I said, I think I \u2014 I have to finish now, so that we make it in time to the bookstore. And the people started to yell, don\u2019t stop, keep going, we want to hear more. Which is fascinating, I mean it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 they were really interested and into it and asked intelligent questions and I have since discovered that in these little New England towns, the library is really the focal point of the community. That\u2019s where people gather. I mean, it\u2019s a sort of intellectual exercise. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s always a good sign and very gratifying. But apart from that, and I spoke to an Orthodox synagogue in London where there were 450 people and no microphone because I was billed as the \u2014 the Shabbat preacher, 1f you will. And so nobody could turn on a microphone and I couldn\u2019t hold a piece of paper, because that\u2019s working. I mean, carrying the piece of paper. And so I thought how, as a sergeant major you would have to shout that you could be heard at the other end of the parade ground and I thought I sa \u2014I\u2014 I did that when I was a sergeant, I\u2019Il do it again. Be \u2014 the rabbi was doing it. And it worked very well, and I was given all kinds of honors, opening the ark and closing the ark, I was worried whether it was \u2014 you \u2014 you asked earlier about my religious orientation, which was \u2014 activity, which was somewhat marginal. I was Bar Mitzvahed, and my grandfather was a very religious man, but he never explained Interview with Peter Masters _ September 25, 1998 a\u2014a-\u2014a word about \u2014 not even at Seder, he just rattled off his prayers and \u2014 and was a\u2014 nota teacher. Well, so I was worried whether I was going to do all these things right in the Orthodox synagogue, I\u2019d never officiated in \u2014 in any synagogue leave alone an Orthodox one. And they said there will be somebody behind you who will tell you to do all the right things, and it turned out it was very, very simple, it worked very well, and I shook hands for umpteen officials in a given order [indecipherable] traditional. I also spoke at a Reform synagogue to largely veterans. And there is an a-americ \u2014 an organization called AJEX, the Association of Jewish ex-Servicemen and Women. And they organized that in Edgware, a suburb of London. And I spoke there, and when I finished \u2014 again, marvelous audience, the \u2014 there wer-were questions and one man stood up in the audience and said, you say your mission is to spread the word that you didn\u2019t go like lambs to slaughter, you are accomplishing that, I trust. But you are accomplishing another mission that you don\u2019t even know of. And he held up a British army pay book, which every soldiers carries. And he said, this is my uncle\u2019s pay book. \u2019ma member of the Sachs(ph) family of \u2014 of refugees from Germany. And my uncle served under the name of Seymour in your commando troop. And until we read your book just now, the family did not know what happened to him beyond the war office telegram saying that he was killed in action. In your book you say that i-in the night assault crossing of the river Rhine, you were in a amphibious track Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 111 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 cra \u2014 vehicle called the Buffalo, and that the Buffalo next to yours in mid-river was hit and burst into flames, and that nobody got out alive, as far as you know. And two of the people on it, you say, were Fogel(ph) and Sachs(ph) who served under the name of [indecipherable] and Seymour. And this 1s the first time we found out what happened to my uncle. And that brings closure to our feelings and we thank you for it. And people in the audience started to cry, and it was very emotional, and I felt that 1t somehow made it all worthwhile to have done this, and struggled to write the book and to do this. And that\u2019s by no means all. I had the phone call from a woman who said that her name was Claudine Schindler. Actually Claudine Arbour Schin-Schindler. And she had seen the article about me that was caused by my book in the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith international magazine, th-the monthly. And it said that my name had been Arany, and her name had been Arany, and were we related? And she started to lay out her family. And she is the granddaughter of my father\u2019s oldest brother, who was a \u2014 quite a character, in fact the name Arany was invented by him. The family name had been Freed(ph) but on \u2014 being in Hungary he wanted to have a Hungarian name, and what\u2019s more, he was a sort of macho character who in the 20s wore a black leather jacket and rode a red Indian motorcycle. And my father imitated him in almost everything, his older brother. They were both jewelers. Arany in Hungarian means gold, so it was sort of a pun to have that name. And in addition, it\u2019s the name of the national poet Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 112 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 of Hungary, Arianosh(ph), and aristocratic, he wanted tha \u2014 obviously. And he \u2014 he was divorced from a very nice woman whom I knew much better than I knew my Uncle Carol(ph), Ilsa(ph) who ran a \u2014 a pensionne 1n the country that belonged to some very wealthy relatives of hers. But she was sort of the poor relative. Lovely woman, who invited us as children a couple of times to this pensionne in the country and I have very nice memories of that. We had to be on our best behavior because of all the elegant people there. And she had two sons, Aussie(ph) and Jurry(ph) Arany, and apparently they got out. We were not in touch. And they got out and lived in France throughout the war, running from place to place in hiding, as people did who survived in France. And then one of them got \u2014 oh, in France they changed the name Arany to Arbor, spelled like the English word arbor, but pronounced arbore(ph). And one of them got to Brazil, and then got the rest of the family, postwar to Brazil, and some went on to the United States. And this woman was terribly excited about having found a relative because she didn\u2019t know that she had any relatives at all. And her father is dead, and so is her uncle, the two sons of Carol(ph) and Ilsa(ph). And she said, I will tell my brothers and they\u2019Il probably call you. And the next day I had a telephone call from Brazil, from what is after all a first cousin once removed. And they are all coming \u2014 he is coming to America in November, and he\u2019Il rent a car and bring down as many of the family as he can. And as I said, all very, very excited. So I 113 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 found some close relatives I didn't know I had. I mean, I knew they existed, but that\u2019s the next generation, you see? The generation after. And the \u2014 th-th-there are three grown children of the woman in New Jersey, and the \u2014 the youngest just graduated from college. And I did know at one point that I thought the two sons of my uncle had gotten out, because in London, in her apartment building, my mother needed some wrapping paper once, and she borrowed it from a Mrs. Buerger(ph) who was living at the other end of the corridor. And Mrs. Buerger(ph) gave her a used piece of brown wrapping paper, that\u2019s all she had on hand. And on it was the name of one of these two boys, cousins. But my mother, being divorced from my father, had no interest in taking up a relationship, and she just remembered the fact that she had seen the name, and so maybe they got out, she said, and I s\u2014I said, ask Mrs. Buerger whether she knows these people. And nothing ever happened, it \u2014 1t ran off into the sand."

            "question": "How has your book been received with respect to sales?",
            "answer": "I have had nothing but excellent reviews. Some of the major papers have not reviewed it. The \u2014 and \u2014 and you learn a whole new thing, you know, about what to \u2014 what did I know about publishing? A woman called me from \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d saying I review books for \u201cThe Wall Street Journal,\u201d but they devote very little space to it. I loved your book, but \u2014 and I wrote a review, but it may not appear. And, it didn\u2019t, because there are lots of books and limited space and that\u2019s how it is. And the publisher\u2019s weekly pub \u2014 which guides libraries, published it very favorably, and suddenly at the be \u2014 114 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 be \u2014 beginning of last months, the \u201cJerusalem Post\u201d reviewed it, with a very, very good review. And the \u2014 it \u2014 it suddenly rekindles a \u2014 you know, like \u2014 like a fire that dies down and then catches a \u2014 a flame anew, this goes on and on. And I get phone calls and letters from people all over the world. I had a letter \u2014 a-and a \u2014 a tape \u2014 a CD from Australia from a man who said he is sending me a CD of the song, \u201cThe Bells of Aberdovey,\u201d which is where we trained in North Wales, and I knew of the song. I\u2019ve forgotten how it goes, but I \u2014 I remember it from that time. And he said, I am the first tenor on this record, because I am Welsh. I live in Australia now, but I thought you might like to have it. So he sent me a CD of \u201cThe Bells of Aberdovey.\u201d I mean, as I say, weird things happen all \u2014all the time. And various friends whom I \u2014 with whom I had lost contact have contacted me because they\u2019ve heard of \u2014 seen the book and \u2014 and sought me out, or they wrote \u2014 or they wrote to the publisher to forward mail to me. One of my best friends is the son of an Austrian matinee idol who \u2014 Hubert Marischka. His name is Franz Marischka and he lives \u2014 he was in the Pioneer Corps with me, he lives in Munich now. He came to spend the day with me in London from Munich especially. And he is the grandson of Victor L\u00e9on who wrote the libretto for the \u201cMerry Widow,\u201d and the godson of Franz Lehar. And quite a character in his own right, and we had a marvelous day comparing notes. I would never have recognized him, he is a\u2014 a \u2014 a little portly, bald man, and he was a dashing, blonde, young movie actor when I knew him. So \u2014 but we had a lot of fun.

            "question": "What is the status of the movie that\u2019s being \u2014 that was optioned [indecipherable] 115 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998",
            "answer": "The status of the movie may be known to the moviemakers, a-and \u2014 and I \u2014 not even to the publisher, because the publisher handed it to the William Morris Agency, who acts as his agent, and o-other than my having a contract with the publisher for a portion of subsidiary rights, lest anyone thinks that \u2014 well, one of the English papers wrote the last paragraph in a review saying, and Peter Masters sold his book, \u201cStriking Back,\u201d to the movies for a million dollars. Well, don\u2019t you believe it. First of all, there\u2019s no million dollars. Secondly, the William Morris Agency gets 10 percent off the top. The publisher gets 50 percent of the remainder. That\u2019s already si\u2014 more than 60 percent if you take then off the top. Then my \u2014 my daughter Kim who covers Hollywood told me, you have to have a lawyer when there\u2019s a movie contract. And I said, why, naively. And she said, try to go it alone and see what happens to you. So I have a lawyer in Hollywood. He gets five percent, okay? Then they bought the movie option, that doesn\u2019t mean they are making the movie just yet, although they assigned a writer and a producer, which is promising. But I haven\u2019t seen a piece of paper, but when I ask I am told it\u2019s a done deal. So a done deal is a favorite expression 1n the publishing business. Now, people expect me to tell them how to get books published [indecipherable] and I used to say, look, \u2019'm a novice and I don\u2019t know and that didn\u2019t seem to make them very happy, they thought I was hedging. So after awhile I decided I would try and give them more of an answer. And so I came up with the following formula. And they send me manuscripts, okay? So I said, it takes three ingredients. One, you have to have an unusual story, because no matter how moving your story is, if it is one of many, the chances are it will not get published. So, an unusual story is one. Number two, you have to be able to tell it reasonably well. I 116 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 mean, you can be edited and helped, but reasonably well. And the most important ingredient is the third one, and that is luck. Because I don\u2019t know, I mean, I feel I\u2019ve \u2014 as I say in my book, I\u2019ve been lucky all my life. Lucky to get out, lucky to be able to get into England, lucky to be able to join the army, lucky to be able to get into an elite assault unit and be able to fight back. Lucky to survive that. Lucky to be able to get my book written and accepted by the first publisher. Lucky to have the movie thing, lucky to have all the other things that are happening in conjunction with it. So, that\u2019s what it ta \u2014 it takes as far as I\u2019m concerned, and look, if the movie doesn\u2019t turn out as I would hope it would, or isn\u2019t made bef \u2014 as long as I live \u2014 I don\u2019t know how these things work \u2014 my wife Alice points out, you\u2019ve done your thing, you\u2019ve written your book. Right now there is a debate raging about \u2014 raging is perhaps an overstatement. But one of the members of my troop, who was in combat very briefly because he stepped on a mine and lost a foot in Italy, so he was out of it. He continues his law studies, became a judge in England, which isn\u2019t bad for a Jewish refugee boy from Europe, and he\u2019s now a retired judge. And he picked up the ball as it were, when my book came out and he wants us to contribute money to a monument in North Wales. And the \u2014 to my utter shock, the words on it did not include the word Jewish. So I started a sort of agitating, lobbying campaign to enlist support of ex-members of the troop or widows or families to insist that it does include the words Jewish. He \u2014 the judge went so far as to say that my saying a Jewish commandos war against the Nazis in the subtitle was a blur and a s \u2014 and the flaw in my book. And after I got over the shock and \u2014 and told him off about making such an excessive statement, I had quite the time writing him a letter saying, having been a judge I suppose 117 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 you feel you must be judgmental in some direction. I am slowly beginning to understand where this comes from, and it\u2019s very simple. First of all, this is not America, where we have just finished talking about the fact that 50 years ago there was overt anti-Semitism. It has become unfashionable as I say \u2014 as I put it. It\u2019s, in sophisticated circles equally unfashionable in England, but there is the fear of it among Jews in Britain, apparently. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 and here\u2019s the thing. When we were first changing our names and becoming a different person, that was rather fun for most of us, because having been a hate object in Germany, Austria, Hungary, having been a poor refugee, as most of us were, having been in the labor unit, which was the bottom of the army, becoming an elite unit member and wearing the green beret and the parachute wings for which we had qualified, and then knowing we were risking considerable \u2014 our lives, o-our limbs, carried with it a certain satisfaction and pride. And to be a different person, I mean, I \u2014 I became ultimately, well, a commando, a commando sergeant, an officer in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, a good regiment. And I am Peter Masters and \u2014 and gone is the refugee Peter Arany, you see? Now, some of them relished that so much that they didn\u2019t want to step out of it because they felt 1t would be stepping back. And so, to my utter shock, one of my friends in Edinburgh where I spoke at the Church of Scotland church hall, and a classmate of mine from grade school invited lots of people and arranged it so I had a very nice audience. Yet, a commando friend of mine in Scotland didn\u2019t invite anybody. And I suddenly realized that the reason he didn\u2019t invite anybody is because it would have blown his cover, now. Because he has a Scottish name. He has very little accent, much less than I do, and I suppose he can account for that by 118 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 our cover story where he was aw \u2014 brought up or something. He is the president of \u2014 or was, of the local rugby club. And if \u20141f he \u20141f he invited people to something called, \u201cStriking Back: A Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazis,\u201d and he was one of the commandos, the thought would occur to them that he too is a Jewish commando from Europe, and he doesn\u2019t want to be. And the judge probably doesn\u2019t want to be anything except a retired judge. And that goes for quite a few. Now it doesn\u2019t go for everybody. The widow of my friend Harry Nomberg(ph) says who \u2014 whose name is \u2014 is Beatrice Nomberg(ph) and she is from Argentina. Catholic, and Harry\u2019s dead, died recently. And she says Harry wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way but that it says mostly Jewish. And the judge says that was not a prerequisite for joining the troop. It was not in the criteria that qualified you and I said, that\u2019s true. But where would they have found German speaking people who wanted to do special and hazardous duty, if it had not been for refugees that were Jewish and German speaking. And he says, well, some of them were \u2014 were not Jewish. They were half Jewish or they were baptized, or they were \u2014 they didn\u2019t even know that the \u2014 part of their family was Jewish. And I said, the Nazis knew. [break]"

            "answer": "Sure. In \u2014 in 1984, I retired. It was the earliest time that I could retire, and that always brings with it certain f \u2014 financial disadvantages, but I felt it was high time for me to get a \u2014 get out of what had become a rather difficult thing. The time of enthusiasm that we had had in the \u2014 1n the poverty program was long gone. Even the transformation into wanting to take on the \u2014 the musty look of government and try and brush it up into something more contemporary and positive, that was beginning to ebb away and the fights were more frequent than \u2014 than the \u2014 the \u2014 the challenges. And there were various \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 that\u2019s another thing in that period of government, and that is that you can have an administration, a government with which you agree politically, but the person in charge of your agency may not be at all conducive to doing any positive things in \u2014 in what I considered my field and my charge. Or reversely, you might have an administration that is unacceptable politically to you, and you have no choice until next election as it were, and then you may lose. And the \u2014 a-and yet it might be possible to do some positive things because you have somebody who is interested and who cares. Now, in the overall, 120 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 in order to improve, and there have been conscious efforts of bringing good design to government, not always, what shall I say, enlightened efforts. But there were times when Nancy Hanks was in charge of \u2014 of the endowment, and she had a way to get around politicians that was admirable. And in \u2014 so \u2014 so there \u2014 there were times when it \u2014 when one had the feeling that something worthwhile could be accomplished, and there were other times when it seemed utterly hopeless. Utterly hopeless. And we \u2014 I \u2014 I remember \u2014 I remember trying to get \u2014 to come up with a formula a-and saying, well \u2014 o-or \u2014 at least an analysis, a diagnosis of why things were so hopeless at times and it 1s because the government is made up almost entirely of lawyers. All right? Now, I have nothing against lawyers per se, but with the very specialized methodology of American education, unlike some European educations, which in my opinion emphasize general knowledge and a general sort of Renaissance view of not knowing only your subject, but also the arts and literature and music and something of a-at least basic something. This does not necessarily hold in this country. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to be a brilliant lawyer and have absolutely \u2014 if \u2014 if you were asked to name three American sculptors, they couldn\u2019t do it. Which is astonishing, you know? There have been some wonderful ones. But I mean, ap \u2014 quite apart from that, perhaps the size of the country is counterproductive to this kind of thinking because if you ask me to name an artist from every of the 50 states, I probably would have a very 121 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 hard time, because well, because I \u2014 and \u2014 and you see, there are layers of knowledge. There are people who know a lot about a subject, there are people who know a li\u2014a bit ab \u2014 some, and there are people who know a little and then there are people who know nothing. And it\u2019s perfectly possible to be prominent in one field in this country and know nothing about the others. It\u2019s a bit shocking, but then there are many shocking things like that, culturally. I\u2014 I\u2014 one of my favorite examples since I was in Japan a few years ago 1s tell me somebody who knows anything \u2014 anything about Japanese culture, who learned it in school. Thi \u2014 anything besides \u201cShogun\u201d and \u201cMadame Butterfly.\u201d Anything about the background of an ancient culture, you see? And we don\u2019t learn it in school, I guess it\u2019s assumed. I mean, unless you\u2019re a specialist, because perhaps it\u2019s assumed that there is so much knowledge out there that you can\u2019t know it all. Computers can change that a bit now, because you can, if you\u2019re at all interested, you can look it up in the internet and it\u2019s pro \u2014 no doubt in there. And I wonder to what extent that will spread a degree o-o-of feeling, of general knowledge? Now, when \u2014 if we don\u2019t have a president one day who really cares about the arts, beyond the Kennedy Center Awards, do you think that \u2014 that the arts will flourish all by themselves a-as congress encourages sponsored by corporations, rather than by the endowment and so on? This is a very tricky subject, you see? It da \u2014 it \u2014 some of it isn\u2019t going to happen. And if you look back, historically, whether we have had any 122 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 arts in \u2014 in top positions; there\u2019s Thomas Jefferson, who was in his own right, an inventive, creative mind that I think overlapped into the arts and certainly into architecture. What he did at Monticello and at the university 1-is \u2014 is admirable. Can you think of any other ones? You see, you \u2014 I probably don\u2019t know enough about some of the intervening ones, but \u2014 but certainly, I mean \u2014 okay, Rockefeller was an art collector and he was vice-president. Whether he collected \u2014I don\u2019t know his motivations. Mondale\u2019s wife was into ceramics, all right? Jackie was into \u2014 int \u2014 into interior decoration, all right? But \u2014 but going backwards, do you think that Carter, Bush, Reagan? Well, into movies. Eisenhower, Kennedy? Blank. You see, I mean, an interest - Humphrey was very interested in photography. We did a big photo exhibits when I was in the poetry program that he prompted. And it was lovely. I took him through it and it was marvelous how perceptive he was. But you see, we are not going to elect an artist or even an art collector president, it \u2014 as it stands. And then th \u2014 and I think that it would take a strong hand to do something to \u2014 1-1-in fact, let me backtrack that [indecipherable]. It is marvelous that we are doing as well as we are, because the point \u2014 the center point of the arts has actually shifted to this country from \u2014 from Europe, from Paris to New York and perhaps Los Angeles, I don\u2019t know. Chicago. And \u2014 and we are doing amazingly well considering that \u2014 that what I just said holds true. And when I applied for my Fulbright you may recall, my 123 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 principal, a Scots painter said they are in their Elizabethan age in the United States, artistically, culturally. Meaning the first Elizabeth, right? So, we are doing remarkably well, we could be doing much better still, with more encouragement, with less sort of redneck small town attitudes about the arts being on the border of something questionable, and sinful and not quite reputable. Which is what we are seeing every time the endowment happens to \u2014 to endorse, or not even endorse, but \u2014 but gets marginally involved with a grant that is then used for something that is appalling and shocking. And of course, that\u2019s the chance you take, to some extent. You can\u2019t pre-examine and sense everything you award, and some of them are going to misfire. So, we get some demonstrative art that\u2019s a bit beyond the pale when people shoot themselves 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in the toes in order to \u2014 yeah, there was some man who \u2014 who considered that demonstrative art, he actually shot holes into himself on the stage, or the other one kicked herself in chocolate in the nude, and so on, and this is performance art, you see, but th \u2014 there 1s much in art that is shocking if it is new. Some of it is bad. Well, if you want some good, there\u2019s also going to be some bad, th-there has to be freedom. Now, perhaps one can control that a little bit, but the attempts have been made to go by local standards only. Well, there are some Noguchi sculptures in Seattle that the government, General Services Administration under its arts in \u2014 in government buildings program put in, and a local congressman protested that these were pet 124 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 rocks, because Noguchi takes a stone and works it minimally, but very, very beautifully. My judgment okay, but not only mine. And he thought that this was meaningless, and a waste. And a Sugarman sculpture in a court in Baltimore was hated by the judge and the judge rules his court like a-an autocratic ruler. And he said it was dangerous because it offered hiding places for muggers who would waylay the secretaries when they came from work in the evening. Well, I mean, these are pretty farfetched criticisms. He just didn\u2019t like that sculpture, you know. And maybe it was not a nice sculpture, I mean, a-are you going to love all sculptures equally? I heard scathing criticism of the Roosevelt Memorial. And then I \u2014 and I haven\u2019t seen it yet. And I looked at a brochure about it, and the artists who were involved, like Baskin and Segal and \u2014 and Benton, who is the carver of the letters, are top notch people. So it can\u2019t be all bad. Oh, I didn\u2019t continue that I said \u2014 well, in \u201984, in \u201984 I retired and I took my early retirement and \u2014 and made a rousing farewell speech where I told them all what was wrong with government and with the General Services min \u2014 Administration in particular and it made people blanch, but I really loved the opportunity to use the commando spirit and \u2014 in at least telling them how it was, which was pretty much off the rails by that time and I was glad to \u2014 to get out. And I freelanced and I started to work on my book. I freelanced and my daughter Anne is in the same \u2014 she has design studio, of course, it\u2019s high tech.

But there are things that I \u2014 I maintain, I\u2019m not sure she would agree, that I can do that the computer can\u2019t. And so we work together and she does the technological stuff and she has very good ideas, but they work better when we brainstorm together. And we do that by phone and in person, and \u2014 and the last conversation was this morning, on th \u2014 a project she is working on. And we come up with \u2014 with very nice solutions together."

            "answer": "Paula Ammon(ph) wrote an article in the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith monthly magazine called what, \u201cJewish Monthly,\u201d I think? And it\u2019s an international magazine. And they sent a photographer out whose \u2014 whose name I\u2019d have to look up, but he is brilliant, because he actually took a picture of me that I like, and that\u2019s hard to do. He took a lot of pictures and they used one, and it shows that even as a septuagenarian first time author, you don\u2019t have to look like a decrepit old man. He \u2014 and she wrote a very nice article. There were a couple of errors. One she didn\u2019t do herself, because somebody else writes the table of content at the front of the magazine. And in that table of content, they \u2014 this person wrote that I had served in Normandy and Salerno. And I was nowhere near Salerno. But some of our people were. My friend Stefan(ph) Rosskum(ph) who served as Steve Ross 126 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 was in Salerno and I think the judge who is now retired, with whom I am debating the inscription on the monument was in Salerno, and \u2014 and they were in Anzio and in Salerno, and then in the river crossings in the Italian campaign, the Carilliano(ph), the Isonzo and so on, before we landed on D-Day. But I was not in Salerno. Secondly, the second mistake is much worse, it says that when I went to art school in London after my military service, I wanted to get into the Central School of Art and Design, because I had heard that it will \u2014 because it was so anti-Semitic that it was hard to get in. That is totally untrue. She got that fir-first because I \u2014 I said that I had been told it was a very competitive school and it was hard to get in, not a word of anti-Semitism is true. I made up my mind that I would get into the school because it was competitive and it was going to be difficult to get accepted. I felt that I had perhaps an unfair advantage because I was still in uniform, and if you come to apply to a school after six years of war ina commando uniform with parachute wings and your medal ribbons, the chances are they\u2019re gonna let you in if your work isn\u2019t terribly bad, I guess my work was not that terribly bad, although I remember sitting in a life class and the very prominent painter who taught that life class looked over my shoulder and said, how many times a week are you taking life class? And I said, three times a week. And he said, make that five. A sobering experience. So, and it says then, with \u2014 with typical chutzpah I became president of the students union. Well, the person who 127 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 told me it was hard to get into the school in the first place was a young woman who had just graduated, and she boasted that she had been president of the student union, she was a refugee. And so I decided that I would get into the school and become president of the student union, and I did. So that was not with typical chutzpah, but I said, with the drive of an ex-commando, I dis \u2014 I became president of the student union."

If you would take a moment and reflect on \u2014 on the birth of the state of Israel. You\u2019ve talked about that before, but things since the birth of Israel, the Eichmann trial, and Israel\u2019s wars. As a refugee now living in this country, how have those events impacted you?",
            "answer": "Well, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I told you the story that after the war, there were annual memorial services at Westminster, and when people came out of the \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Westminster Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, because I think I\u2019ve been to one.

Well, the Israeli \u2014 the Israeli military effort appeared to me to be a continuation of this thing that I was about, the \u2014 the striking 128 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 back mentality. And if anything, they underscored what I was trying to demonstrate, because when I was a high school kid in Vienna, the notion that Jews would fight meaningful, strategic \u2014 no, meaningful military assault actions seemed very farfetched. The pictures the Nazi tried to create was that Jews were persons that sought desk jobs in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u2014 or \u2014 and were over intellectualized and physically incapable of any actions such as the one required in \u2014 such actions as the Israelis demonstrated they were extremely capable of doing, and we too, in our way, demonstrated that we were able to do that sort of thing and do it well. It hadn't really occurred to the world, and I find that \u2014 that Jews could do an Entebbe raid, or fight off a vast armored superiority with mainly the spirit and \u2014 and enthusiasm and ingenuity of a dedicated people. So all this was very important to me, and it had not really \u2014 well, 1-1t was novel, and it was bright and shiny. And I think it was wonderful that these things \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that we were gathering respect. At times I was appalled at the attempted turnaround of making that this was comparable to the militarists on the enemy\u2019s side. In other words that mean- spirited critics would say that the Israeli actions were Nazism in the Middle East. I think that that 1s a partisan point of view, that I-I find very hard to stomach. And again, I have friends who are much more knowledgeable about the details of some of these Israeli actions, and who when criticized for the politics, which of course is \u20141s \u20141S a\u2014a\u2014a popular pastime anyway, point out the geography. And I\u2019ve been 129 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 to Israel once, and I stood on the Golan Heights, and I \u2014 I said, if it were mine, I wouldn\u2019t give it up, because it means that they can do \u2014 aim shooting into the kibbutz on the other slope, and I obviously would have to prevent that from happening. Much of this is outdated now because if the warfare is by rocket and missile, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you do observed shooting or not. Nevertheless, the narrow waist of Israel is so \u2014 is so narrow that you find that to give up territory that would make it narrower still, is not the kind of thing you want to do easily and without some guarantees that are meaningful."

            "answer": "About Jewish resistance I\u2019ve had some lively de-debates, mostly by letter with the Holocaust Museum people, because I feel that we who, as refugees, volunteered for special and hazardous duty and put our lives on the line, that this 1s unlike somebody joining the armed forces and serving at the Pentagon. It seems to m \u2014 especially if you judge it by its ultimate results. It\u2019s true that people were killed in all kinds of units here and there, but many of us were killed. Twenty of 86 were killed. And almost all were wounded and some of the wounds were by no means minor, a lost eye, a lost leg, things from which they subsequently, years later, became invalids and died. I \u2014 I think the fact that a \u2014 a refugee who 1s, by 130 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 definition a person who escaped, who \u2014 who either went into hiding and escaped or managed to escape when it was still possible to do so without pretense, usually penniless, did not sit back and say, we\u2019ve suffered enough and let somebody else do it, but volunteered and volunteered and volunteered and overcame all the difficulties that 1t took me and my friends to be allowed to volunteer for risky things. I say we are resistance, and they say this \u2014 by resistance we define the people in the forests of Vilna, or the people who, in the Warsaw uprising, and I certainly agree that they were resistance, and I would define it by saying they were resistance of desperation, because if you are in their situation in the Warsaw ghetto, if you are in their situation hiding in the forests and trying to \u2014 to do damage to the enemy, y-y-you \u2014 you ar \u2014 this is a \u2014 a desperation move. If you questioned and interviewed them as I am being interviewed now, they would say, the ideal thing for us would have been to get out if we could, if only we could. To get equipped and trained, trained and equipped, and then to come back with the maximum effectiveness of the well-trained, well-equipped person. I don\u2019t really want to quibble about this indefinitely, because if they don\u2019t call us resistance, okay. I think we were resistance, that\u2019s all. I think we did what we could to resist and \u2014 and were willing to take risks and volunteer and volunteer and volunteer. And volunteer on top of volunteering for special assignments. So that gave us immense satisfaction, insofar as we survived it, and I would say even insofar as we 131 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 didn\u2019t, it was a comforting thought to those who lay dying that they had done it in luc \u2014 that they were there because they wanted to be."

You mentioned what you called reaction beyond reflex, and you talked about knowing that sometimes a person needs to take action. I was wondering if you could expand on that, since this is a follow-up to that interview.",

You have a feeling, at times, in \u2014 in situations that might be desperate or \u2014 or dangerous, or whatever, that somebody has to take some action that is required to resolve the situation. And you have the fi \u2014 th \u2014 and the follow-up feeling of that feeling is, in my experience, that you find \u2014 and if I don\u2019t, perhaps nobody will take the necessary action. That therefore you \u2014 you \u2014 you realize \u2014 and this doesn\u2019t \u2014 isn\u2019t a lengthy process, you suddenly realize somebody must do something and must do it now and nobody seems to be doing it, so I better. So you do it. And you do it swiftly and with determination and you have decided to do it and so you do it. And this 1s true in a great many things and has its application by an extension to \u2014 to non-wartime situations where the feeling is, Somebody must do something, and \u2014 and \u2014 and what \u2014 what \u2014 what can I do? And 1-1 \u2014 perhaps it\u2019s entirely up to me. Sometimes with some of my best 132 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 commando friends, I found that as I was thinking somebody must do something, they were already doing it, because they had a similar mindset. But not everybody does, and I think that to \u2014 to take a long bridge to some of our political problems at the moment, I heard somebody ask not long ago, where is the person who is taking the kind of action that was taken by an Ed Murrow in the McCarthy situation, by speaking out with authority and saying, this has to stop.

I understand what this is all about, I understand that \u2014 that \u2014 and I have my own partisan view of it, wh-which \u2014 which is irrelevant. I-It seems to me that it ought to be possible to rise about the partisan thing when the damage done to our daily lives, the \u2014 the mere fatigue of \u2014 of listening to the ongoing argument about the various options of, and what disasters each one of them will bring upon us, surely gets you to f\u2014a point where you say, enough already.

            "answer": "Well, when Kennedy was in the White House, I heard from inside people who had worked there, I think the f \u2014 the thing was that \u2014 the phrase, if I remember it rightly was a man telling me, well you know he has this thing about airline stewardesses. And I thought \u2014 I \u2014 I had no idea what you were talking about and 134 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 then they spelled it out to me about the swimming pool adventures of Kennedy. And you see, that \u2014 at that time, this sort of thing was going on, but traditionally not talked about except in \u2014 in \u2014 in stage whispers, and entirely separate from all other considerations. Now, I-I can see how any moralist person would object to the details of \u2014 of \u2014 of the sexual adventures of the present president. I \u2014 I \u2014 I think that it is of course true, that if I described you \u2014 to you any sexual activity by anybody in detail, 1t would sound shocking, simply because we are not used to seeing this sort of thing in print, except \u2014 I mean, the beginning \u2014 le-let me backtrack there. When D.H. Lawrence wrote \u2014 wrote \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover\u201d where he first called \u2014 u-used the expressive language for a sexual activity, that was banned and considered shocking. It was the first time it had really happened by a major author. James Joyce describes oral sex in considerable detail. The sug \u2014 but it\u2019s not customary in the average novel or \u2014 or history to go into detailed descriptions, largely because the hint of Hollywood before overt sex on the screen, the hint 1s more powerful than the spelling out. It has more \u2014 more \u2014 1-1-1t\u2019s in \u2014 it\u2019s more tasteful, it\u2019s \u2014 it-it\u2019s more genteel. That caused some authors to go deliberately the other way and write it very bluntly. Miller, not Arthur, but th \u2014 \u201cTropic of Cancer,\u201d if you recall, made it very, very \u2014 spelled out sex references. Personally I\u2019m not shocked by anything, I think it\u2019s in pretty poor taste. And the best criticism I have found, the one that strikes me the most 135 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 meaningful is the one that a president shoul \u2014 knowing that in today\u2019s scenario this will come back at him and be publicized all over the place, takes what is a \u2014 a very reckless risk in \u2014 in doing it. And \u2014 and that is, to me, the main criticism. The fact that he did it doesn\u2019t interest me at all. People do all kinds of things, some are more kinky than others. But you see, there is another current in the present thing and that is, to many patriotic and religious Americans, the Oval Office is somewhat comparable to the holiest of holy in the temple, and \u2014 before its destruction. And so, if anything happened \u2014 like that happens in the Oval Office, which was presumably the ambition of this young woman, so that she would have her place in history, sh-she \u2014 th-the thing 1s that this 1s in and of itself appalling, because it was \u2014 it desecrated the holiest of holy in the temple of the White House."

Now, we get multiple speculation. One of my pet aversions at the moment, by the way, 1s the talking 136 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 heads, when \u2014 and \u2014 and the only credit you have to explain who they are, is a former prosecutor. It\u2019s a favorite choice. There are lots of former prosecutors, of all \u2014 of all shades, you see? Now, I think \u2014 and I\u2019ve seriously considered to \u2014 to try and communicate that wish to the media, they ought to be compelled to say \u2014 to give a\u2014 an extra s \u2014 a\u2014a-a subtitle under former prosecutor and saying, a former prosecutor, a political appointee appointed by Richard Nixon, for instance. Because then you would understand \u2014 I mean, I understand where they come from by what they say anyway, but I think there are lots of people out there who say ah, a former prosecutor. Must be a legally well-informed person, you see. And some of them were shallow political appointees, ultra-partisan appointees and the least you could do is say, who put them there to be a former prosecutor, so that we \u2014 everybody can understand th \u2014 and anticipate what they are going to say. Now, if what they are going to say 1s a partisan line, that they tell you. And then they\u2019ll say \u2014they\u2019|l anticipate what might be done to counteract that. And they will say, the f \u2014 the following options, and so wa \u2014 in any case they will exhaust and dismantle any option before it has even been dreamt of by anybody. And now there 1s nothing new you are going to hear, but you are going to hear again and again and again that this was a minor burglary, and this is not a case of sex, but a case of profound obstruction of justice. And to \u2014 to me, I would even suggest that all these lawyers get together and say that perjury in cases of denying sexual activity should 137 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 be discounted as ca \u2014 as perjury. Because, it\u2019s an automatic reflex. If you ask somebody \u2014 it\u2019s like the question, when did you last beat your wife? It\u2019s a question, when did you last have an extramarital affair? Gee, I never had an extramarital affair, okay?
