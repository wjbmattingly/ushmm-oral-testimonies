The farmers, one day I got a call, I mean not by phone, but they found me and about four farmers came, they said, \"Look, we, your father always sold us textiles. We liked your parents very much, they were so good to us. Needed credit, got credit, we didn't have money...\" That's how my, my mother was always active in this kind of work. \"And we have decided that we took a piece of land, ________________ and we bought 12 cows in the pasture and here they are for your uncles. Now, my uncles had never lived there, they had ne ver lived there, they knew my mother. And they said, \"Here they are, you go an d trade with them and when you make money, you pay us back .\" Well my uncles took that of course, it was very, very emotional. They did and they became extremely successful cattle dealers, to a point that there was another two men, two Jewish men who also had survived, who were friend, old friends of theirs and the four of them, they were the largest exporters of cattle to Isr ael. They had boatloads go ing out of Rotterdam every three months. And they devel oped in Israel, the dairy indu stry. They, they supplied the Israeli's with the dairy cows, which came from Holland, you know the black and whites? The Holsteins? And they were experts, my uncl es and their two friends. So my uncles became quite succe ssful again, in their businesses."

But the Jews that were left out of the camp and I've checked this with other friends, so-called colleagues, that when they came out of the camps they did not kill Ge rman civilians.

So my friend found his sister's da ughter in Poland, he had come from Poland as a young boy and he went, this guy could move mountains, and he went to Poland and found this girl, brought her back to Holland in 1946 and she had no place to live, he had a house, she moved in with him. She was 18, 16, 18, ________________ 18 by now. And they fell in love and he want to marry her, except in Holland you can't do that, that's against the law. And so he made a request to Queen Wilhemina, is the only one who can do this , only the Queen and she can give you permission, whatever that's, that's call ed. And she wrote him back t here's no way I can do that, we don't do this and denied. So he, when he came back fr om the camps, he came back on a stretcher and on that hospital where he was brought in over the border, the Princess Julianna(ph), she visits ho spitals, ________________ like to visit hospitals _______________, wonderful family. And she visit that hospital and he was laying in the bed , he had come back out of Auschwitz and they took a picture of her standing at his bed. And she said to him, \"If ther e's ever anything I can do for you, feel free, you can call me.\" Whic h is, which is like gi ving you a check you can cash when you need it, you know. So he , so he wrote a letter after the Queen turned him down, to the Princess, said, \"I want you to talk to your mother, I want to marry my niece.\" And the Princess wrote him a le tter back, these are all true stories. \"I can't give you permission, my mother doesn't waive, no she said so as you well know, but if someday in the future, it will all, things work out normal, I will be Queen, I'm in succession and then you try again.\" 1948, two years later, Wilhemina abdicated her thr one to her daughter, he didn't wait three weeks, he writes a letter to the Queen, then, \"Remem ber me? Here's the picture.\" She gave permission and they married. And they had two wonderful girls, th ey all live in Israel except he died on a trip in, he dropped dead in a __ ______________ at an airport. But before that, when I was in Switzerland, Emil was in contact, he called me one day, he says, Emil was making d eals, American dolla rs, gold, you know and he says, \"I'm coming in such and such a date next week and I'm in a wheelchair and you have to get me off the plane in Zurich.\" I knew this was all a scam, I knew right away that he wasn't in a wheelchair, but he sat in a wheelchair and what he had, he had, he was sitting on a wheelchai r, on a cushion which was, which had maybe, in today's dollar, in those dollars, maybe three million dollars in Belgium and Indonesian and Du tch government bond, who were totally worthless. Worthless because the Dutch government ma de an edict in '45, about within a month or two after the lib eration, that everyone who had dollars, I mean gildens(ph), in Holland , had to turn them in and ever y person alive in Holland got 10 gildens(ph) that day. Ever y stock certificate had to be turned in and they forced every corporation or government ________________ to issue all new ones, because the Germans had falsif ied so many. They had em ptied all the safe deposit box, deposit boxes of the Jews and others. So no one knew who was what and who owned what. So Dutch ________________ made a cutoff day in '45, that no one was worth more than 10 dollars. The phony money, the ________________ money, you went to the banks, later on, every week you could get, release some of it because they couldn't gi ve it to you _______ _________ , they had to print it and finally everybody got dollar for dollar and the Dutc h, whatever they did economically. So he now, so now it's 1948, ab out that time and he ran into a guy who says, \"You know, I found in the backyard of my uncle, a whole box full of these bonds, they're worthless.\" So my friend is smart, he sa ys, \"Well,\" he says, \"maybe I can do something with that.\" So he gave the guy, he says, \"I'll give you 5,000 dollars for it, as a fri end,\", this man say, \"but you have to deliver it in New York.\" So I had friends in New York, but ________________ Am erican army, soldiers I met. And I arranged that I deposit some money in, it's a compli cated situatio n, but I got to deliver 5,000 in New York, through the Swiss, through a Swiss bank. ________________ but I had access to, to the business. And he put up 2500, I put up 2500. So now we ow n all these shares and he comes to Zurich, I take him off the plane and he's got a whole big suitcase sitting on him and a pillow. And I have no way what to do with it, I've never done this befor e. I was leaving the next day for Lougano(ph), where we also had a little office and I stayed in this hotel for a couple of years and I got to know the owner and I thought they are very nice people. So that night, I had dinner with them ________________ the hotel and then I tell them, the biggest part of the part of this story, he says, \"I know who can help you, I can help you,\" he sa ys, \"but the man you talk to is a lawyer in Zurich.\" I said, \"I just came from Zuri ch.\" He said, \"Oh, you got to go back.\" So I went back to Zurich and I met this lawyer, I gave him a sample. From that, within three days I was followed by two plainclothesmen. I was followed for two weeks. Two weeks, it was in 19, in August '49, summer of '49. And finally I got so scared, I said there's nothing I can do, they keep on following me and I don't know if they were police or they were gangsters. I thought about police. So I walked up to them, they're sitting on a sidewalk cafe and I sat, I sat down next to them, right on the table, I said, \"Are you following me?\" There was a younger man and an older man, they said, \"No, I'm not.\" I said, \"Well, you are. Last week was so mebody else, but there was ________________ two people following me.\" So I figured I got to have an emotional confrontation here, so I said, \"Look, I know wh at you want, but I'm scared and I don't know how to handle this,\" _______________, show t hem a number on my arm. I said, \"Look, I'm not a gangster, I'm a survivor ________________ the camps, ________________ I'm not a thief, I haven't done anything wr ong.\" And this man says to me, \"You did something wrong, you're peddling illegal documents, I mean stocks, bonds and that's not done in this co untry,\" he says. \"And we're going to put you in jail because you're trying to sell that.\" And y ou, and we, and I didn't know if it was that, wh ich, that's what he told me , but I'd also been buying up gold and I was smuggling it out of Switzerland to Holland, gold coins. But you, and in Holland I could, could ma ke a huge profit every ti me I and I used packs of cigarettes, you know and things like that to smuggl e them over the border. And ________________ maybe and I thought that could be also it. So he says, \"Know what you're doing, you're selling things.\" So he says, I said, \"How can I, how can I stop this?\" Says, \"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" He was an older ma n and he became very sympathetic. He says, \"S ee my car there?\" \"Yeah.\" I was in Zurich. He said, \"We are going to the airpor t right now and I'm going to drop you off there and you get out of this country and never come back .\" I says, \"Okay.\" What was I going to do? All my suits were in th e hotel room, all my clothes. Never went back to the hotel, he wouldn't let me and to the airport. Put me on a plane. I walk in my bosses office in Amsterdam and I say, \"I quit.\" He said, \"Why?\" I say, \"I hate you.\" I couldn't tell him why I was quit, I was doing on his time , all this black market business. So I never went back to Swit zerland for a long ti me, until maybe 1980, the middle 80's with my family. Because now I had an American passport you see, they couldn't do anything . But that's, that's my friend, ________________ . I mean, great stories, as far as I'm concerned, so. I still have a suit somewhere's in a hotel room in Zurich."

So I went to the doctor and he says, I remember, I don't know why I remember that. He said, \"Does it hurt?\" And I said, \"It's very painless.\" So he says, \"Painless? You mean painful?\" I said, \"No, painless.\" No where'd I get the word painless? When I used to be on the bus to go to work, there was an advertising dentist, he was called painless Parker. So I thoug ht, pain, painless, painful, what's the, so I tell him no, it's very painless, he says painful. That's how much English I spoke, now you know. But I learned fast, I went to school every night."

I said, \"How are your kids?\" \"I don't know.\" I said, \"What are you talking about?\" These were people in the camps, I said, oh no, first I said, \"You have grandchildren?\" That's how I started out, because you know, I love my grandchildren, I have a great ti me with them.

I saw the cliques and they sit there and ________________ about how it was in Au schwitz, how it was in Birkenau. I said, I knew it already. Now a lot of, some of the more intelligent survivors didn't talk to ea ch other about it and when the conversation come up, there was nothing to, there was nothing to remember a nd nothing to commiserate at the misery, because it would only perp etuated, I wanted to be like everybody else and I will tell you today, I succeeded to the point that my children are very, very normal, very successful, very smart, they have everything.

Well, I tell you, sinc e Susan works with me here, she saw more what's going on and, but David really, really took to this , to a point that I could see it on his face. His wife also we nt of course and his wife and I are very close, she's a wonderful, wonderful gi rl. They unde rstood it even better, they were very proud that they could see their father's name on the wall there, as one of the markers, you know. And, and maybe they didn't understand when I was ________________ there twice a month for many years. ________________ all about, cause was hard to understand for anyone. But when they saw that, and Fern had been with me in Washington of course, not of ten, but you know, a few times. On the way to Israel we stopped over there, so she was with me. And of course they, they understand it fully. It was not that ther e was any remorse or regret that they had not stopped me, to the contrary, it's just no t discussed. That's what he w ants to do, that's what he has to do, that's what he should do. Oh yeah, and the kishkas(ph) in the, in the, in _______________, they know that it has to be done. They're very, very, my daughter is more of a street person, like me. David is, ther e's no gray with him, it's white or black. An d he's a very, very successful surgeon, he's an orthopedic surgeon here. Very, he's a, he's a real star. I can say that because people tell me that daily. So he's on his own and so there's nothing, in retrospect it's good and I know they're very proud of th at. That's all but, did he ag ree with me at times, no. Not that he said it, but I could feel it. My wife says, \"God, you're killing yourself, you're killing yourself, schleppi ng(ph) there all the time,\" you know, flyi ng back and forth.

Because it's private. I tried to, I tried to wear long sleeves most of the time, which I notice a lot of survivors do. You don't want to, except when I'm in Hawaii where we go on the beach, or on the pool here, swim ever y morning, that you can't help it. People are very respectful of it, to me at least and the ones who ask, I will explain. Non-Jews don't under stand, some of them really don't know what it is. And then I explain it. And Jews, if they have to ask me, then there's something wrong with them, they should know. And do I, I tried to play it down, that's why I don't wear short sleeve shirts in the summ er or in the winter. So and the children never, they never made an issue of it. I'm sure thei r mother explained it to them because that's the protection ________________ they had."

And they were in the import -export business in San Francisco, the offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Manilla. So they didn't know much about, first of all, they were Sephardic Je ws so they had no, no relationship wi th any Ashkenazim in Europe, so nobody was killed, except my wife's, two of he r aunts died in the Japanese concentration camps in Hong Kong, because the Japanese interned the British, they all had British passports. So they died in the camp. Not for, not like the Germans, they died there of, I don't know if it was malnutrition or some diseases, but it was different. That's the only relationship they had with the war, cause they were British subjects."

I can't explain why, but she was. When I met her I was a register, registered Democrat. Why? Because the Jews in San Francisco are all Democrats, so that you know, you ask around, you register, so you register like all the rest of the Jews, Democrat. Until, until, I think was ar ound the Nixon, Nixon era, or there about and I became more conservative and definit ely when the Reagan, I really did not get involved in, in, in overt politics until Re agan, national politic s. For some reason I got involved with the Reagan camp aign here and I used to go and travel with Reagan in southern California to introduce him to Jewish audiences, B'nai Brith lodges and Temples and all this. Because mutual friend was ve ry close to hi s campaign and he asked me to fly down ther e. And then I worked ve ry hard, I was a chairman for Reagan in San Francisco, ________________ Jews. And I'm very conservative and apropos, the majority of survivors and I'm talk ing about camp survivors, now everybody thinks they're a survivor, bu t camp survivors, are Republicans, are conservative. It surprise s ________________ because the biggest surprise when you talk to ______________ __ so-called, they say, \"How can you, how can you, a guy was in the camps, how can you be a Re publican or be so co nservative?\" It blows people's minds, I'm talking about Jews, it blows their mind, cause I'm supposed to be a real bleedi ng heart liberal, you know, who gives everybody else's money away, except their own. And you see I'm pr ejudiced, right? And I'm conservative, because I had to make it, I di d. When I was in the army, I made 72 dollars and that's all I had and I bought a war bond of 18 dollars and 75 cents, every month for two years. Did I have mo ney left over? No, be cause I didn't have enough money because you know, I have to get, certain necessary things you have to buy. I worked at nigh t as a waiter on top of i t, every night and Saturday and Sunday, cause I'm conservative and I, I be lieve that you do it yourself, you help, obviously you know my life a little bit, pe ople that need you, help them. That's why I'm involved so much with all the institutions here. But, but, this, this liberalism to me, is pulling the country in the direction Russia went. Russia is a basket case, they can never get out of this, Russia is gone. Th ey can't pull out of this. And, and I see, I see how we _____ ___________ the deterioration which starts with the economics and then it goes in to the mentality of people and the crime, it's all part of this, this, this ultra-liberalism and I cannot stomach this, I can't handle, I think it's wrong, you need to be more conservative, the liberalism is not goi ng to, is not going to work the way this is designed for this country. It isn't goi ng to work. Holland has a liberalism in a different way and I watch Holland's ________________ the Dutch press, I read a little bit, no t much and theirs is working di fferently, it's working better than ours."

Two-thirds have never been up there, th ey don't know anyt hing about it, they saw dead trees and I think that sometimes you have to help nature. Th ey weren't destroying the whole thing.

They're destroying, they're destroying an industry, very simple. Cause, it's the eagle. Th ey don't care about those God damn trees. Sure, I'm saying they should take all the trees down, but in an orderly fashion you can handle that, but no by saying, not negotiable. The people on welfare because of this.
