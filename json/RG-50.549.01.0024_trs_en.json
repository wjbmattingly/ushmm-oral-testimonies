There were two Jewish lodges here. , almost all Jewish and it's, now, now has changed, that life has changed in America, in the so-called fraternal orders. Some are still around, but the, the Masonic orders are because our lodge, they've merged with four or five others by now and I'm not active at all. And then | went, from the Masons you go to the Scottish , you go to the Shriners, so, that was always nice, you had a circus once a year. But it took care of the children, you know, the Shriner's, Shriner's hospital. So it intrigued me cause | met a lot of wonderful people through that. It was entry for me also in the community, which | didn't have, | had no relatives here, made some friends, but, and | didn't want to just only live in the Jewish community alone, so this was a broader segment of the community and | still have friends today from, from those days. That, that was, was fun. Went there once, | think every week or every other week, | forgot now. Didn't do anything there except talk, except play some cards and listen to lectures. Taught me a little about America. and | couldn't go to school, | went to school the first year, at night, four nights a week.

            "question": "Let's begin if you would with your liberation from the camps.",
            "answer": "lf we, if we start with the liberation was, | was liberated on August, on April, pardon me, on April 30th, 1945, in Dachau, actually in the side camp of . And because the side camp where most of the Jews were. Dachau had at that time, mostly Christians, political prisoners. And the Jewish prisoners, who had come from all part of, of Europe, mostly eastern Europe, they were sent into the side camps and we were in the area of Landsberg and Kahlfring(ph) etcetera, in we were building underground munitions factories for the Germans and for the V2, they were being built right outside, in those areas and there were satellite camps, | don't know how many, but quite a few, | was in one of them. We came there from, from Warsaw. | was in Warsaw and yes, the uprising, from Birkenau, Warsaw, Dachau. And on April 30th, we were in, well on April 24th, or 20, 20, somewheres the week before, 10 days before, we were in one of those satellite Camps and we were marched out. And, | don't know if it's in the previous tape, we were marched out and we marched for several days and we were told at that point, after we were halfway through, one night there'd be, the Germans told us this, had Instructions that the war is over and he have to take all these prisoners to Switzerland and the Red Cross has taken over and Red Cross was taking us all to Switzerland. In retrospect, was a lie, that was only to keep us calmed down and to make us subdued and they could handle us, so, but they marched us two more days and we were back, we were behind the wire in Dachau. So that was the easiest way to keep us together, not to have us escape. Anyhow the, the American army liberated us early in the morning and this morning, interestingly enough, | got a picture from a man whom | met a year ago. His, he lives in Mill Valley, across the Golden Gate bridge. He was one of the soldiers that liberated the camp that | was liberated, that morning and by pure accident, the reason we found each other, we gave, we honored liberators last year as a Yah Meshua(ph), 50th anniversary and we, our staff had a Jewish, a , send off ads and letters and they found 120 liberators in this area, up and down the coast, almost close to Los Angeles and into Oregon. One of these men, during the dinner, that night we gave a dinner for, | was the chairman of it and during the dinner, he said to me, he saw the picture, that famous picture being, which was being used in, for all these years at, at the museum, our museum, he says, \"That is not Dachau.\" It's a picture that you have seen on the, Dachau liberation. It really was Allach(ph). He said, \"That's Allach.\" | said, \"How do you know?\" He said, \"Because | know it as Allach.\" So he twist it back and by God we met again, surely | said and he, he showed me, \"It is Allach(ph), | can tell you.\" And it was Allach(ph). So | have the picture here, so I'm in the picture. And since then he, well he's very active in the 42nd division, the Rainbow division, which is the division we were liberated, who liberated Dachau and our camp and this morning, | lunched with about two weeks ago, three weeks ago and this morning he sent me a picture, which | want to give to the, to the museum in Washington, | don't know if they have this, it's a picture of the American soldiers killing quite a few of the Germans. They lined them up, they lined them up on the wall and they killed them, until an American general came there and saw this happening and he went almost berserk, this general, I'm going to meet with him in a very, very, in the next couple of months, he's still alive. He was so upset that they did this, he kicked, the machine gun, he kicked the soldier and stopped them using the machine gun. And they had killed about 17 of the guards and maybe more. He me that again this morning with the pictures. And | didn't, | realized that | saw that happen, but that came back only today to me. Anyhow, we were liberated and with my luck, a Dutch Red Cross came immediately., for some reason there was a connection about, there were several hundred Dutch Christians in Dachau and other who were, who were political prisoners, saboteurs to, to political, whoever, if they got you, if you're not with them, as you well know. And this appear from the Dutch underground and others and the Dutch Red Cross came immediately, within 10 days, two weeks, to, to the camp, with trucks, Prince Bernardi(ph), then husband of the then Princess, who's now, who's now the Queen Mother already, Juliana's husband, came with them. And they picked us up and they drove us all the way from Dachau back to Holland on those trucks, took about six, five, six days, the bridges were out, you know and stuff. | remember we stopped in Frankfurt for some reason and , lggy Farben(ph) factory, which was a big cafeteria and they kept us there for one or two nights, one night and we went back to Holland and at the border, we, we were asked where we were from and | was not a Dutch citizen, | had no documentation, all | could say, | was from . But I'd only, I'd only lived there since | was 10 years old, we came there 1936, we went over the border from Germany into Holland, only about 25 miles. Wasn't far enough obviously because they killed all my family. And the Red Cross took me back to Holland, to, to, to Berculo(ph) from the, from the, that, there was a town on the border, Savina(ph), where they, it was kind of an army, army town and that's where they held them for a day or two and, and assigned us where we wanted to go. And we were, | was in a, in a, in a pair of black pants, which were some pants I'd taken off a soldier, an SS I'd killed and a toothbrush from the same SS man I'd killed. And the, and the shirts. We had no clothes except the striped things, which we couldn't get out fast enough and they were very filthy. So | was in some beat up German's uniform. And then they gave us other clothes at the border and as much , that's because Holland was in very bad shape in 1945, the Germans had plundered it. And they took me back to my, what | call my hometown and they took me to the city hall, there was no place for me to go. The house was occupied that we lived in, it was occupied by people, | had no idea who they were. And..."

            "answer": "Oh sure, oh | went to school there, oh sure, went to school there, | mean like my father had a business there, my father had a textile store there. And there were, there had been 42 Jewish families and it was known in Holland as the most religious Jewish town. Religious meaning what we call Conservative here. Everybody on Shabbat, everybody eat kosher, nobody smoked on Shabbat and nobody drove his bicycle or car on Shabbat. Very traditional, went to Temple three times a day on Shabbat and during the week twice a day. And everybody had their different businesses, from cattle dealers to butchers to textile to scrap, you know, typical Jewish trades. And we had a, a rabbi and we had a mikba(ph) of course. And there was a wonderful Jewish life there before the war, literary things, my father was quite active in the community and so was my mother and they, but there was no one left when | came there, except the mayor says yeah, there's somebody came back that was hidden and was a man by the name of Mayer(ph) and his children were all, all killed, so was his wife, he survived and was hidden in some farmhouse. And another couple survived, there were no children. And then, they didn't, they couldn't handle me because they had no place to live themselves, they lived somewheres in, | forgot where they , weren't back in their homes yet. And our neighbor, Catholic, was a Catholic town, to some extent, maybe 50-50 and our neighbor came over, they heard about this, a small town, there was 7,000 people and they said, \"He's staying with us,\" so | lived with our neighbors. They , they had a room in the back, near the stables, people have the cows in the, in the winter they stayed, not in the house, but in the back of the house there's stables. So | slept there and they made a bed for me and | stayed with my neighbors, | couldn't, | wouldn't eat pork things, so | usually potatoes and breads and salads, but | couldn't, | did not eat the, the pork products. Which, that was the only thing they had in meat in those days, because they had their own, they raise their own pigs. And | stayed with them for, and the mayor of the town knew my parents quite well, gave me a job in the city hall, to work some clerk, was awful, pencil pushing, you know, whatever that's called and but | had a job because | had no money."

And it was very strange because number one, there was no one left, a few here stray people, Jews, were hidden. No one came back from the camps, | was the only one there who had come back from the camps. And there were Jews in those towns in Holland, every town had Jews and, and they had wonderful lives there. We, we never knew about anti-Semitism. We knew it from Germany, my family and | did, but native Dutch Jews did not Know about anti-Semitism, it didn't exist, as far as | remember. And since | was, | was not a Dutch citizen because we were stateless, til Hitler made the Nuremberg laws, said we are stateless, | never became a Dutch citizen, first | was citizen was when | came to this country, became American in 1954. Anyhow, so | stayed with the neighbors, then about a month or two and | found my uncles. My mother had two brothers who were in the camps and | found them in a camp in Holland, in Westerbork.

But | didn't Know it because the that my parents were there, two of my sisters, they went to Auschwitz, my uncles allegedly stayed with , | didn't know that, but they did stay and they, | don't know how | found them, | don't know how they found me, but we found each other. | forgot who told us how it was done. And then, but they couldn't come to the to Berculo(ph), , there was no place | could, | could put them. So finally they came anyhow. But before that, let me step back a bit. After maybe a month or two, after | came back, I'm called to this, to the mayor's office, in the town and he says, \"You know, your grandmother's here.\" My mother's mother, who had lived with us, cause she also came over the border from Germany, she was a widow, and she had lived with us for, from 30, from Kristallnacht on. Was also shipped to, to Westerbork and wound up too, in Theresienstadt. And she survived. So they brought her back and they put her in a Red Cross van and they, she remembered Berculo(ph), the name, so that the Red Cross, | don't know how she, she got in. | think it was about the same , | came in from over the border. They flew her back by plane and she's sitting in the middle of town and the town's all have a square, you know, with a church in the middle. There is this Red Cross van with my grandmother in it."

            "answer": "No, just herself, no one else. And said, \"You have to take your grandmother \"So | had no place to put her. So was this one Jewish family who were colleagues of my parents, competitors really but, you know, same business. And we weren't close to them, but we knew each other quite well because the Temple and the Shul. He, they said, bring her in. They had gotten their house back. So they took her in, just took her in . They also took in the three children of the rabbi, who were found by Christian, they were hidden by, in, by Christian families, they took the three, three children in, they were found. The parents were killed, the rabbi and his wife were killed, but they found the three children, how, | can, | cannot tell you how they found them. They were hidden in farmhouses, some as far away as 50 miles. So they all of a sudden had a big family and so my grandmother stayed there. And then my uncle's got out of the camp and they had no place to live, so they went, came to town, they . The only place which had almost a . SO my two uncles, they were still single in those days, and they were born, they were at that point in their 40's already, because the war, in '38, it came over the border in '38 from Germany and they were single. They were born in 1901 and 1902, somewhere in those years, they were two years apart. And we put them in the mikba(ph), that's where they lived. No money, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. And they had been quite well off in Germany, they were people of great means, my mother's side. And so | was working and my uncles were cattle dealers and | think | should have it in the story that gives you an, | think | take great credit for that. The farmers, one day | got a call, | mean not by phone, but they found me and about four farmers came, they said, \"Look, we, your father always sold us textiles. We liked your parents very much, they were so good to us. Needed credit, got credit, we didn't have money...\" That's how my, my mother was always active in this kind of work. \"And we have decided that we took a piece of land, and we bought 12 cows in the pasture and here they are for your uncles. Now, my uncles had never lived there, they had never lived there, they knew my mother. And they said, \"Here they are, you go and trade with them and when you make money, you pay us back.\" Well my uncles took that of course, it was very, very emotional. They did and they became extremely successful cattle dealers, to a point that there was another two men, two Jewish men who also had survived, who were friend, old friends of theirs and the four of them, they were the largest exporters of cattle to Israel. They had boatloads going out of Rotterdam every three months. And they developed in Israel, the dairy industry. They, they supplied the Israeli's with the dairy cows, which came from Holland, you know the black and whites? The Holsteins? And they were experts, my uncles and their two friends. So my uncles became quite successful again, in their businesses."

And we had to scream to the soldier, the American soldier because the wires were all high tension wire and they had to bring in the engineers first. The next day or so, or maybe a day, within this, there were about half a dozen of us, we could still walk, we were in fairly good shape.

In my opinion it still it. They, but I've told this many times, I'm very proud of one thing. That in as much as the Jews were liberated, us, be it anger beyond any measure, we had seen killings hourly, not daily, hourly, morning til night, over a period of years. | don't know one Jew, one Jew who killed a German. I'm not talking about soldiers, SS, but not a German civilian, which no one appreciates, the Germans never appreciated that. But the Jews that were left out of the camp and I've checked this with other friends, so-called colleagues, that when they came out of the camps they did not kill German civilians. That gives me the pride as a Jew and as a human being, of that we were still civilized after having lived in the mud and the murders and the gas chambers, etcetera, our Jews were still, still civilized.

And | will maintain, as long as | live and | said it in my own, my own book too, that when history will be written, | hope that some of these stories, writers will say, that during a Christian era, six million Jews were killed.

But he was doing it ona very good sized scale. And maybe | should tell this story about him because | admired him so much. He survived, his wife and two children were killed and by pure accident he found and | don't know again, know how, through the Red Cross | think again. Because in Holland, published names of people who are found and the Red Cross kept on publishing, every week, he looked at those lists, that's how a cousin of ours found my grandmother.

            "question": "Where were the lists published?",
            "answer": "In the Jewish press, there's a Jewish press, very . So my friend found his sister's daughter in Poland, he had come from Poland as a young boy and he went, this guy could move mountains, and he went to Poland and found this girl, brought her back to Holland in 1946 and she had no place to live, he had a house, she moved in with him. She was 18, 16, 18, 18 by now. And they fell in love and he want to marry her, except in Holland you can't do that, that's against the law. And so he made a request to Queen Wilhemina, is the only one who can do this, only the Queen and she can give you permission, whatever that's, that's called. And she wrote him back there's no way | can do that, we don't do this and denied. So he, when he came back from the camps, he came back on a stretcher and on that hospital where he was brought in over the border, the Princess Julianna(ph), she visits hospitals, like to visit hospitals , wonderful family. And she visit that hospital and he was laying in the bed, he had come back out of Auschwitz and they took a picture of her standing at his bed. And she said to him, \"If there's ever anything | can do for you, feel free, you can call me.\" Which is, which is like giving you a check you can cash when you need it, you know. So he, so he wrote a letter after the Queen turned him down, to the Princess, said, \"| want you to talk to your mother, | want to marry my niece.\" And the Princess wrote him a letter back, these are all true stories. \"I can't give you permission, my mother doesn't waive, no she said so as you well know, but if someday in the future, it will all, things work out normal, | will be Queen, I'm in succession and then you try again.\" 1948, two years later, Wilhemina abdicated her throne to her daughter, he didn't wait three weeks, he writes a letter to the Queen, then, \"Remember me? Here's the picture.\" She gave permission and they married. And they had two wonderful girls, they all live in Israel except he died on a trip in, he dropped dead in a at an airport. But before that, when | was in Switzerland, Emil was in contact, he called me one day, he says, Emil was making deals, American dollars, gold, you know and he says, \"I'm coming in such and such a date next week and I'm in a wheelchair and you have to get me off the plane in Zurich.\" | knew this was all a scam, | knew right away that he wasn't in a wheelchair, but he sat in a wheelchair and what he had, he had, he was sitting on a wheelchair, on a cushion which was, which had maybe, in today's dollar, in those dollars, maybe three million dollars in Belgium and Indonesian and Dutch government bond, who were totally worthless. Worthless because the Dutch government made an edict in '45, about within a month or two after the liberation, that everyone who had dollars, | mean gildens(ph), in Holland, had to turn them in and every person alive in Holland got 10 gildens(ph) that day. Every stock certificate had to be turned in and they forced every corporation or government to issue all new ones, because the Germans had falsified so many. They had emptied all the safe deposit box, deposit boxes of the Jews and others. So no one knew who was what and who owned what. So Dutch made a cutoff day in '45, that no one was worth more than 10 dollars. The phony money, the money, you went to the banks, later on, every week you could get, release some of it because they couldn't give it to you , they had to print it and finally everybody got dollar for dollar and the Dutch, whatever they did economically. So he now, so now it's 1948, about that time and he ran into a guy who says, \"You know, | found in the backyard of my uncle, a whole box full of these bonds, they're worthless.\" So my friend is smart, he says, \"Well,\" he says, \"maybe | can do something with that.\" So he gave the guy, he says, \"I'll give you 5,000 dollars for it, as a friend,\", this man say, \"but you have to deliver it in New York.\" So | had friends in New York, but American army, soldiers | met. And | arranged that | deposit some money in, it's a complicated situation, but | got to deliver 5,000 in New York, through the Swiss, through a Swiss bank. but | had access to, to the business. And he put up 2500, | put up 2500. So now we own all these shares and he comes to Zurich, | take him off the plane and he's got a whole big suitcase sitting on him and a pillow. And | have no way what to do with it, I've never done this before. | was leaving the next day for Lougano(ph), where we also had a little office and | stayed in this hotel for a couple of years and | got to know the owner and | thought they are very nice people. So that night, | had dinner with them the hotel and then | tell them, the biggest part of the part of this story, he says, \"| know who can help you, | can help you,\" he says, \"but the man you talk to is a lawyer in Zurich.\" | said, \"I just came from Zurich.\" He said, \"Oh, you got to go back.\" So | went back to Zurich and | met this lawyer, | gave him a sample. From that, within three days | was followed by two plainclothesmen. | was followed for two weeks. Two weeks, it was in 19, in August '49, summer of '49. And finally | got so scared, | said there's nothing | can do, they keep on following me and | don't know if they were police or they were gangsters. | thought about police. So | walked up to them, they're sitting on a sidewalk cafe and | sat, | sat down next to them, right on the table, | said, \"Are you following me?\" There was a younger man and an older man, they said, \"No, I'm not.\" | said, \"Well, you are. Last week was somebody else, but there was two people following me.\" So | figured | got to have an emotional confrontation here, so | said, \"Look, | know what you want, but I'm scared and | don't know how to handle this,\" , show them a number on my arm. | said, \"Look, I'm not a gangster, I'm a survivor the camps, I'm not a thief, | haven't done anything wrong.\" And this man says to me, \"You did something wrong, you're peddling illegal documents, | mean stocks, bonds and that's not done in this country,\" he says. \"And we're going to put you in jail because you're trying to sell that.\" And you, and we, and | didn't know if it was that, which, that's what he told me, but I'd also been buying up gold and | was smuggling it out of Switzerland to Holland, gold coins. But you, and in Holland | could, could make a huge profit every time | and | used packs of cigarettes, you know and things like that to smuggle them over the border. And maybe and | thought that could be also it. So he says, \"Know what you're doing, you're selling things.\" So he says, | said, \"How can I, how can | stop this?\" Says, \"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" He was an older man and he became very sympathetic. He says, \"See my car there?\" \"Yeah.\" | was in Zurich. He said, \"We are going to the airport right now and I'm going to drop you off there and you get out of this country and never come back.\" | says, \"Okay.\" What was | going to do? All my suits were in the hotel room, all my clothes. Never went back to the hotel, he wouldn't let me and to the airport. Put me on a plane. | walk in my bosses office in Amsterdam and | say, \"I quit.\" He said, \"Why?\" | say, \"I hate you.\" | couldn't tell him why | was quit, | was doing on his time, all this black market business. So | never went back to Switzerland for a long time, until maybe 1980, the middle 80's with my family. Because now | had an American passport you see, they couldn't do anything. But that's, that's my friend, | mean, great stories, as far as I'm concerned, so. | still have a suit sSomewhere's in a hotel room in Zurich."

So they didn't know much about, first of all, they were Sephardic Jews so they had no, no relationship with any Ashkenazim in Europe, so nobody was killed, except my wife's, two of her aunts died in the Japanese concentration camps in Hong Kong, because the Japanese interned the British, they all had British passports.

Because the Jews in San Francisco are all Democrats, so that you know, you ask around, you register, so you register like all the rest of the Jews, Democrat. Until, until, | think was around the Nixon, Nixon era, or there about and | became more conservative and definitely when the Reagan, | really did not get involved in, in, in overt politics until Reagan, national politics. For some reason | got involved with the Reagan campaign here and | used to go and travel with Reagan in southern California to introduce him to Jewish audiences, B'nai Brith lodges and Temples and all this. Because mutual friend was very close to his campaign and he asked me to fly down there. And then | worked very hard, | was a chairman for Reagan in San Francisco, Jews. And I'm very conservative and apropos, the majority of survivors and |'m talking about camp survivors, now everybody thinks they're a survivor, but camp survivors, are Republicans, are conservative. It surprises because the biggest surprise when you talk to so-called, they say, \"How can you, how can you, a guy was in the camps, how can you be a Republican or be so conservative?\" It blows people's minds, I'm talking about Jews, it blows their mind, cause I'm supposed to be a real bleeding heart liberal, you Know, who gives everybody else's money away, except their own. And you see I'm prejudiced, right? And I'm conservative, because | had to make it, | did. When | was in the army, | made 72 dollars and that's all | had and | bought a war bond of 18 dollars and 75 cents, every month for two years. Did | have money left over? No, because | didn't have enough money because you know, | have to get, certain necessary things you have to buy. | worked at night as a waiter on top of it, every night and Saturday and Sunday, cause I'm conservative and I, | believe that you do it yourself, you help, obviously you know my life a little bit, people that need you, help them. That's why I'm involved so much with all the institutions here. But, but, this, this liberalism to me, is pulling the country in the direction Russia went. Russia is a basket case, they can never get out of this, Russia is gone. They can't pull out of this. And, and | see, | see how we the deterioration which starts with the economics and then it goes into the mentality of people and the crime, it's all part of this, this, this ultra-liberalism and | cannot stomach this, | can't handle, | think it's wrong, you need to be more conservative, the liberalism is not going to, is not going to work the way this is designed for this country. It isn't going to work. Holland has a liberalism in a different way and | watch Holland's the Dutch press, | read a little bit, not much and theirs is working differently, it's working better than ours."

Two-thirds have never been up there, they don't know anything about it, they saw dead trees and | think that sometimes you have to help nature. They weren't destroying the whole thing. Plus the fact, how many people are out of jobs there? There's, the unemployment is unbelievable there in that area. Because that's all they had to live off, that industry. Destroy it? They're destroying, they're destroying an industry, very simple. Cause, it's the eagle. They don't care about those God damn trees. Sure, I'm saying they should take all the trees down, but in an orderly fashion you can handle that, but no by saying, not negotiable. The people on welfare because of this. And there must be a middle path. You don't have to be on welfare, everybody. Healthy, workable people. But there's no other industry up there. It happens constantly. | can tell you that closing up the situation was chairman of the, he built a wing, the new wing on the Jewish home, he lost, we_ had, certain glass, from PPG, largest company in the country. We found out after we were waiting for delivery that the factory closed up because, it was closed up because of, happened to be the union closed up that factory and we had to go to Spain and buy that, that whole town was unemployed. There's got to be a middle path. You see this, it goes too far. Now as a dictatorship, my side, no i's no dictatorship. But some people need, some people need guidance, but not the guidance of saying, we'll worry about you, just get out of bed in the morning, if you don't want to get up, we'll pay you anyhow.
