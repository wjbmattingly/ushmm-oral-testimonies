[indecipherable] it\u2019s not mine, you know, I couldn\u2019t, you know, how -- how could you- so I had to walk out, we walked out in the streets, we start walking the street. We didn\u2019t have - we have no place where to go. So we figured, well maybe we should take a tra -- the trains were running, should take a train to the next small town, somewheres, whatever it is, another -- another 50 - 70 miles, maybe it\u2019s better there, there aren\u2019t that many people over there. Here, everybody sticks to one place. So we got to the station, to the train station, we get -- they wait -- waiting in line for tickets, and the man, a Jewish man [indecipherable] is behind us and he looks at us, says where you going? I said, we\u2019re going next town. What\u2019s the matter, he says, you got relatives there? So why you -- what kind of che -- what you do? I said, we\u2019re tailors. We all of u- we all of us were tailors, three of us. [indecipherable] me and Tanchim, we met a guy, one guy, another friend of ours on the border, we took him along, so we\u2019re three of us. Oh, tailors, he says, I\u2019m going to a town where my daughter lives and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a better town than here, it\u2019s a little further, and you\u2019ll be better off. Y-You\u2019re tailors, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get work over there, you'll get settled down, things like that. Well, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll go with -- we go with you. No, he says, we'll go with you. Why yi -- how co -- we don\u2019t have where to sleep, so -- where to go, where to stay, with whom. So he says, for two guys, my daughter has a little sofa -- a sofa in the li -- P\u2019Il give you the sofa, and you\u2019ll [indecipherable] the third one, we\u2019ll find another place, so the two of you -- well, it\u2019s a big -- a good deal, two of us [indecipherable]. So we all agreed. We went with him and we landed in the town of Baranovich, and as he promised, we got to his daughter at night, and -- and he told her that he brought two -- two guests, you gotta give them where to sleep. So he give us the soft and two of us slept the sofa and then my third one, Tanchim had -- he went to a -- to the shul, the next -- was around the corner a shul, and he says, well, plenty room in the shul says, if you want to [indecipherable] til we\u2019ll get -- til you find a place. So we had the -- where to stay. In the morning we start out looking for work. You know, you stay, we want to work, and do -- make it to -- live on something, you [indecipherable] you need some money. You know, looked around, we walked around the city, and my one fire -- one friend of mine found work, from the three of us, found a job, he was a ladies\u2019 tailor, he found a good job -- a good job, a job [indecipherable]. We -- I think I walked out another wa -- we walked in the street there together, a guy walked over to -- behind us, he was a -- and then he came over, he says, I\u2019m a rabbi, what are you? You look -- you refugees? Yes. You -- what 1s it you -- what are you doing for a living? Well, we\u2019re tailors. Oh, I need a coat, he says, I\u2019m going away, and -- he\u2019s going -- he\u2019s a Russian [indecipherable] from a little town. So [indecipherable] says, I don\u2019t have a machine, I don\u2019t have -- oh, he says, my mother has a house. You stay in the house, and then you could do -- make it and she [indecipherable] a house, has a machine and everything. First of all, 1t was a good idea, the house. She got a house [indecipherable] got in the house because it was bitter cold, and we just turned around the streets and we were frozen ca -- and now, even though we didn\u2019t -- 1t was very cold, and na -- just the feet are wet because of snow. So we got and warm upped ourself a little bit. She sort of was really still [indecipherable | his house was a little -- a little, small house, and it was warm, you know, little cats on the -- on the chair, little cat was warming on the oven. It was such a peaceful house, and the -- this lady, old lady is putting in firewood and taking [indecipherable]. So I says, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s such a good place, you know, you could stretch out the legs and things like that. And I start working on the coat, without no knowledge what to do with it, but I start working, and I stretched the work it should take a little longer. I\u2019d never made a coat, but I made it. My friend helped, and working [indecipherable] we made his coat."

So -- and towards the evening, we sort of were told to go to get ready to go home, to go to the ghetto. So we were about 73 people, those who remained hiding inside, they didn\u2019t want -- want to go [indecipherable] and we didn\u2019t go before, but now they want to wait, they said they -- they have to go to the ghetto, you had to go home. And here we still heard the news from -- and we heard the guns -- machine guns, that they\u2019re still killing people. So there was question, you know, was like going to a ghetto, you going right into -- to the open -- to this slaughter. So the people were afraid to go, but they had to -- they had to sort of make sure to -- to stay. If they could stay, they would say if they could stay here in the -- in the place of work another night, would be good. So one lady came into my tailoring room with a gold watch and she put the watch down and said -- she told me, go in and talk to the -- our head. Rudel is the head of the -- our officers, if -- to bribe him, he should let us stay one night more. If they a -- the slaughter will go by. So I said -- looked at her, I said, you -- you know, you crazy, because I -- this man never came into me, I [indecipherable] he doesn\u2019t know me, cause the others -- officers work -- came in for work, he never came in to work -- for work. And so is -- but til -- she left the watch, she walked out, you do it. I says, that\u2019s the only way out -- she said, whether I could -- could do it, and think to do it. And I was sitting 1n [indecipherable] says, she is crazy. I mean, he never -- he never came -- he never know me -- he never came to me, and I can-cannot go bribing somebody like that, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ridiculous. Well, waiting, waiting, waiting, and there\u2019s no other solution, so the pe -- so people says, well, what can you -- what would you do? What can you do? Well, I said, [ll -- have no choice and I have to go, whatever is -- if -- if I wouldn\u2019t do that, you say, oh, if you would have gone, you have -- do -- did something, it -- it would have -- 1t would have been something. Now, we are really without any he -- without any help. So I took this watch and I walked over, this is one barrack where the officers lived, and I have that [indecipherable] everything over there in one bag. I walked over and I -- I la -- never was in this office, never went -- I knew more or less where the doors -- it\u2019s right the first door. So I knocked the door, and he says, enter [indecipherable]. So I walked in and Is -- was -- had to stand on the rear door, I didn\u2019t move. I just walked in, I didn\u2019t move, because his -- this room, the decorations around give you a Sc -- give you such a scare, all this Hackenkreuz 1s -- banners hanging and the [indecipherable], the Hitler and Goerings and everything all around. Is -- is just like Goering or something, or some other officer in his office in -- in a -- in the back of the room, and in a -- ina de -- on the desk. And I says -- so -- so he says, well, well, was -- what do I want -- what do you want? Say, I want to talk to you. So he -- he sits in a [indecipherable] so come here. I walk over and I didn\u2019t ask anything, I took out the watch and put on the table. He says -- I says, look, this is what we have, what one of the ladies have and she doesn\u2019t need it, because if we go home the ghetto we gonna be killed anyhow, you might use it, s -- give it -- send it to you. One of your family, I don\u2019t know whether he was married or not, never knew. He says to me in a quiet way, he says take it back, I don\u2019t want it, I don\u2019t need it. [indecipherable] and I le -- I look at him and I was -- I don\u2019t see the same person. He -- he asks me to sit down, and you know what -- what happen. And I sit down, I says, take the watch. Forget it, he says, take it back, and nothing going to happen to you. It\u2019s over. In other words, this load is over. And nothing is going to happen to you, nothing is going to happen. I said, well I still hear the guns. He says, I -- I have or -- I have information, he says. So I walk out and -- with this news, and I told the guys waiting for me, and I told them that we could go home and nothing is going to happen, it\u2019s over. Meanwhile, we still heard the guns, we still heard the machine guns go. And time goes shorter and we -- we have to go soon, at six o\u2019clock we going home. So they said to me, look, we going to go a column with people, with 70 people. They don\u2019t know who we are or what ev -- what kind of [indecipherable] we have. See -- do something, tal-talk to him, see if maybe he\u2019Il send somebody to explain to the guards, you know. Well, I said, maybe they\u2019re right, but since I saw that he is -- didn\u2019t -- he -- he not, you know, the same guy is over there. So I went over and I -- again, I says that the people are afraid to go because they don\u2019t know where they will -- if they know what we are, who we are or something like that. And I said, if you would have [indecipherable] I mean, I thought -- as I thought -- if you would go with us to lu -- I mean, to the gate and te -- explain who we are. So he was thinking a few minutes. Okay, I'll go. So he got into his car and he drove ahead and we marched with 12 guards, of Air Force guards to the ghetto. And it was not complete over, but it was over. At that moment, when we came to the gates, we saw Mr. Isikson was led out by SS. Two guys took him and his assistant to their car and put them away -- took him away, for good. So that\u2019s why, he did -- he didn\u2019t obey the orders. He didn\u2019t give them the 4,000 people. He made [indecipherable] -- so that\u2019s what it is. I mean, they -- they ne -- appointed another guy for Judenrat, for -- they appointed another guy."
