I said, we\u2122re going next town. What\u2122s the matter, he says, you got relatives there? So why you -- what kind of che -- what you do? I said, we\u2122re tailors. We all of u -- we all of us were tailors, three of us. [indecipherable] me and Tanchim, we met a guy, one guy, another friend of ours on the border, we took him along, so we\u2122re three of us. Oh, tailors, he says, I\u2122m going to a town where my daughter lives and I\u2122m sure it\u2122s a better town than here, it\u2122s a little further, and you\u2122ll be better off.

So we all agreed. We went with him and we landed in the town of Baranovich, and as he promised, we got to his daughter at night, and -- and he told her that he brought two -- two guests, you gotta give them where to sleep. So he give us the soft and two of us slept the sofa and then my third one, Tanchim had -- he went to a -- to the shul, the ne xt -- was around the corner a shul, and he says, well, plenty room in the shul says, if you want to [indecipherable] til we\u2122ll get -- til you find a place.

You know, looked around, we walk ed around the city, and my one fire -- one friend of mine found work, from the three of us, found a job, he was a ladies\u2122 tailor, he found a good job -- a good job, a job [indecipherable]. We -- I think I walked out another wa -- we walked in the street there together, a guy walked over to -- behind us, he was a -- and then he came over, he says, I\u2122m a rabbi, what are you? Y ou look -- you refugees? Yes. You -- what is it you -- what are you doing for a living? Well, we\u2122re tailors. Oh, I need a coat, he says, I\u2122m going away, and -- he\u2122s going -- he\u2122s a Russian [indeci pherable] from a little town. So [indecipherable] says, I don\u2122t have a machine, I don\u2122t have -- oh, he says, my mother has a house. You stay in the house, and then you could do -- make it and she [indecipherable] a house, has a machine and everything. First of all, it was a good idea, the house. She got a house [indecipherable] got in the house because it was bitter cold, and we just turn ed around the streets and we were frozen ca -- 50 and now, even though we didn\u2122t -- it was very cold, and na -- just the feet are wet because of snow. So we got and warm upped ourself a little b it. She sort of was really still [indecipherable] his house was a little -- a little, small house, and it was warm, you know, little cats on the -- on the chair, little cat was warming on the oven. It was such a peaceful house, and the -- this lady, old lady is putting in firewood and taking [indecipherable]. So I says, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s -- it\u2122s such a good place, you know, you could stretch out the legs and things like that. And I start working on the coat, without no knowledge what to do with it, but I start working, and I stretched the work it should take a little longer. I\u2122d never made a coat , but I made it. My friend helped, and working [indecipherable] we made his coat."

So -- and towards the evening, we sort of were told to go to get ready to go home, to go to the ghetto. So we were about 73 people, those who remained hiding inside, they didn\u2122t want -- want to go [indecipherable] and we didn\u2122t go before, but now they want to wait, they said they -- they have to go to the ghetto, you had to go home. And here we still heard the news from -- and we heard the guns -- machine guns, that th ey\u2122re still killing people. So there was question, you know, was like going to a ghetto, you going right into -- to the open -- to this slaughter. So the people were afraid to go, but they had to -- they had to sort of make sure to -- to stay. If they could stay, they would say if they could stay here in the -- in the place of work another night, would be good. So one lady came into my tailoring room with a gold watch and she put the watch down and said -- she told me, go in and talk to the -- our head. Rudel is the head of the -- our officers, if -- to bribe 84 him, he should let us stay one night more. If th ey a -- the slaughter will go by. So I said -- looked at her, I said, you -- you know, you crazy, because I -- this man never came into me, I [indecipherable] he doesn\u2122t know me, cause the othe rs -- officers work -- came in for work, he never came in to work -- for work. And so is -- but til -- she left the watch, she walked out, you do it. I says, that\u2122s the only way out -- she said, whether I could -- could do it, and think to do it. And I was sitting in [indecipherable] says, she is crazy. I mean, he never -- he never came -- he never know me -- he never came to me, and I can-cannot go bribing somebody like that, you know, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s ridiculous. Well, waiting, waiting, waiting, and there\u2122s no other solution, so the pe -- so people says, well, what can you -- what would you do? What can you do? Well, I said, I\u2122ll -- have no choice and I have to go, whatever is -- if -- if I wouldn\u2122t do that, you say, oh, if you would have gone, you have -- do -- did somethi ng, it -- it would have -- it would have been something. Now, we are really without any he - without any help. So I took this watch and I walked over, this is one barrack where the officers lived, and I have that [indecipherable] everything over there in one bag. I walked over and I -- I la -- never was in this office, never went -- I knew more or less where the doors -- it \u2122s right the first door. So I knocked the door, and he says, enter [indecipherable]. So I walked in and I s -- was -- had to stand on the rear door, I didn\u2122t move. I just walked in, I didn\u2122t move, because his -- this room, the decorations around give you a sc -- give you such a scare, all this Hackenkreuz is -- banners hanging and the [indecipherable], the Hitler and Goerings and everything all around. Is -- is just like Goering or something, or some other officer in his office in -- in a -- in the back of the room, and in a -- in a de -- on the desk. And I says -- so -- so he says, well, well, was -- what do I want -- what do you want? Say, I want to talk to you. So he -- he sits in a [indecipherable] so come here. I walk over and I didn\u2122t ask anything, I took out the watch and put on the table. He says -- I says, look, this is 85 what we have, what one of the ladies have and she doesn\u2122t need it, because if we go home the ghetto we gonna be killed anyhow, you might use it, s -- give it -- send it to you. One of your family, I don\u2122t know whether he was married or not , never knew. He says to me in a quiet way, he says take it back, I don\u2122t want it, I don\u2122t need it. [indecipherable] and I le -- I look at him and I was -- I don\u2122t see the same person. He -- he as ks me to sit down, and you know what -- what happen. And I sit down, I says, take the watch. Forget it, he says, take it back, and nothing going to happen to you. It\u2122s over. In other words, this load is over. And nothing is going to happen to you, nothing is going to happen. I said, well I still hear the guns. He says, I -- I have or -- I have information, he says. So I walk out and -- with th is news, and I told the guys waiting for me, and I told them that we could go ho me and nothing is going to happen, it\u2122s over. Meanwhile, we still heard the guns, we still heard the machine guns go. And time goes shorter and we -- we have to go soon, at six o\u2122clock we going home. So they said to me, look, we going to go a column with people, with 70 people. They don\u2122t know who we are or what ev - what kind of [indecipherable] we have. See -- do something, tal-talk to him, s ee if maybe he\u2122ll send somebody to explain to the guards, you know. Well, I said, maybe they\u2122re right, but si nce I saw that he is -- didn\u2122t -- he -- he not, you know, the same guy is over there. So I we nt over and I -- again, I says that the people are afraid to go because they don\u2122t know where they will -- if th ey know what we are, who we are or something like that. And I said, if you woul d have [indecipherable] I mean, I thought -- as I thought -- if you would go with us to lu -- I mean, to the gate a nd te -- explain who we are. So he was thinking a few minutes. Okay, I\u2122ll go. So he got into his car and he drove ahead and we marched with 12 guards, of Air Force guards to the ghetto.
