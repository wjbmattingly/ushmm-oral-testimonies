How do I know that? One day, we worked outside where we were living... We didn't hear anything... then all of a sudden \"Booom\", bombs coming down. We looked up - we did see the white - that's all we saw - white, but no uh...no noises from the engige, no nothing. Just a white thing passing by.

Of course, they give us and we brought it into the place where we lived and we give it to the German woman. We says, \"Here's food. And you cook us whatever there is.\" And later on, was established - because all of a sudden there were at least about fifty of us in that place - in that little town. So, we went to the American authority again to establish the refugee camp. There was a refugge camp so we could get food - as a refugee camp. So, we were there for about, oh I would say after the war - about two months or three, maybe. Then we.. we got up to look for relatives in the concentration camps. Where did we go? We went to Bergen Belsen. Bergen Belsen is on the English side. So we came to Bergen Belsen, I find my cousin there. And he didn't find nobody but he found himself a girl there. And he married this girl, he made a wedding there. - I went outside to organize some food, liquer and things like that and as I'm coming with all these goodies into the camp - there were English soldiers who were watching the camp. As I'm coming in with the goodies, what do you think the English soldiers did? They confiscated everything that I had. Can you imagine that?"

So, were three of us -no- four of us, but that Moishe was staying with a girl and three of us, we went back again to the city. Again with coffee and with cigarettes and chocolates, we organized again. This time, we didn't go through the main gate. We cut a hole through the fence and that's how we got in. And we made him a wedding, a beautiful wedding. Then, I organized a...\"bout thirty people to go home - to Romania. That time it was again Romania. So, as we... I organized everything, we went to the train and we got a wagon and everything and as we go to Czechoslovakia the train stops and, what do you think? It's Russian soldiers. They come to the train, and they want to rape the girls. As I know a few words in Russian, so I don't know, by luck or what - they went away. I had with me Hungarians and Romanians. The Hungarians were from Budapest, I had people from Budapest and I had people from Romania, which we went home."
