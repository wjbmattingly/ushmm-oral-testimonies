They were running like crazy. That time, we runned eve...day and night. The worst thing was, the \"katusha\" -you know - the weapon kaytushah. The Russians did'nt have too many katushas, they carried the ketushas from one front to the other. But one good weapon that the Russians did have -an aeoroplane - a white aeroplane, before they hit the targets, you couldn't hear them, they shut the motor, they flew without the motor. How do I know that? One day, we worked outside where we were living... We didn't hear anything... then all of a sudden \"Booom\", bombs coming down. We looked up - we did see the white - that's all we saw - white, but no uh...no noises from the engige, no nothing. Just a white thing passing by. So, those two items: the kaytusha and that aeroplane - they had the most fear. When uh...when anybody uh the Russians...no I mean the Germans or the Hungarians or the Italian or the French, who ever heard that...uh uh...that machine, that kaytusha -they run like crazy. So that's what, the, when we head back, all the time we heard that katusha. And we came...we came back to all the way...to uh, to Poland. And uh...we was stationed ...uh before I do that... When we left Hungary to ....to Poland, we were four Kommandos, from the same place. And three kommandos was completely, completely wiped out. They was sent to the Russian front, uh as...mine sweepers."
