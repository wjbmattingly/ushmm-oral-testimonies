Somebody came and took the names down, a policeman, and made up a list. I told him let's not put our names down, because you never know what's going to happen. And that's why I'm always afraid. And he said well, 1f everybody puts their name on a list, why should I not? I don't want to be left all by myself here so anyway he put his name down on a list too for all of us."

They broke windows. They really created a stir. Some had children. We also had children, but we were quiet, hoping that they'd let us go. So other people whom they had just taken but started creating a ruckus, they sent them home. Now I'm sorry too. How come we didn't make some noise too? Maybe we could have gotten away from being sent away. So they came. They took us to the school. My mother was coming, crying, to let us go. They didn't. My mother showed all the papers about my father being in the army and they said well, maybe they'll be freed later on. My mother went to the police. Every where she showed the papers...nothing. So we were taken away. We stayed at the school maybe about two days and then they took us to Socora (ph). They...in Socora they put us on a train. It was a long train. It had brought people from all over, not...many cities, not just us. And took all of us who were there in that neighborhood who were on the lists, but not the others.
