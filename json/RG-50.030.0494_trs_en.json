He came back to Subotica and at some very early age, still in his 20\u2019s, became editor of a newspaper. My father, as soon as he finished high school went to work for a lumber mill in what 1s now Croatia, to support his brother. My uncle married very well. He married a woman from Temesvar, now Timisoara. The daughter of a very well-to-do porcelain manufacturer. And I suspect with hi -- with her dowry, my uncle bought the newspaper -- the printing plant. And he was the editor, my father was the manager. My uncle died in 1935, and then my father became the editor and my aunt became the manager."

Every 30 minutes the bell rings and the wing moves up on the assembly line from one station to the next station. That was the life. Food somewhat better than Auschwitz- it\u2019s better than Auschwitz. Fortunately there was this absolutely first rate Czech cook. He was fat, he was really fat, who, I don\u2019t know how he did it. Kitchen scraps from the guard\u2019s food, \u2019'm sure table scraps from the guard\u2019s food. Vegetables that the si -- the town crew managed to steal or whatever. He provided some taste and some variety to the -- to the daily soup. So it was -- life was on the edge of being bearable, not quite. I still, after all of these years I think back with amazement at what people in this circumstance still managed to do. Obviously there were shoemakers who could prepare your shoes with sole from discarded tires that the grounds crew found and shoe nails that were cut from scrap lumber. Obviously there were tailors who -- who with needle and thread gotten on the black market from the -- from the civilians could fix your clothes. Those kinds of things you expect. You don\u2019t expect to see these two brothers, Hungarian Jews deported from Holland, diamond grinders by trade, who ground prescription glasses out of bottoms of discarded milk bottles. Jewelers who took scraps of aluminum from the plant and created these carved boxes that could be traded. Beautifully carved, elaborately carved boxes. Some others made these very elaborate boxes out of pleated s-straw that could be bartered with the -- with the German civilians for ne -- needle, thread, soap, tobacco, few things. There were about five or six -- maybe five to eight kids my age, mostly, as I said, Budapest with their fathers. One -- one kid I remember from Transylvania with his father. These gentlemen decided that our education could not be interrupted, so after 12 hours workday, they sat us down, classes in algebra and French. Oh, everything, of course, was punishable by death, particularly smuggling o-out of the plant. Everybody who had a opportunity smuggled out scrap aluminum, scrap tools, sharpening them into weapons at night. The lights went out about half an hour after meals were served. You could hear for hours stone bowl -- pebbles being scraped against metal to create wa -- knives. I was very proud of a knife I made for myself out of a -- a -- a hacksaw blade. There were -- of the 700, probably a hundred were Soviet POWs. The Germans did not honor the Geneva convention, and the Soviet POWs were in the same boat as we were. And some of them were the strongest, in terms of trying to make weapons. Training for a uprising. Throwing knives. Many of them had fashioned these heavy knives with very heavy handles and practiced."

Whatever sabotage we could do, we -- we did. It didn\u2019t really matter because it turns out -- well, eventually, by January, the railroad line was bombed.

Lot of people would -- lot of people wanted to stage an uprising. We had counterfeit keys to all of the guards\u2019 rooms. That\u2019s not eas -- not hard to do. The inmates were -- were taking the -- the food across several locked doors. With the key you just chew some -- some bread dough in your mouth, make an impression in the key and there were locksmith who could duplicate that. The SS, the officers were living upstairs, we didn\u2019t think we could get to them. So there was a big debate and the kapo decided that -- that we didn\u2019t know where the American front was. It seemed to have slowed down after the -- after the Battle of the Bulge, that we would march out. The kapo gave orders to the leaders of the brigades that everybody was free to escape if they could.

            "answer": "So after eight days we arrived at another satellite ca-camp called Berlsteed, which some of the old time prisoners recognized. That had been a brick factory which produced the -- the bricks for Buchenwald and for the other camps. So we had a little bit more freedom cause we\u2019re inside the fence, inside the barb wire fence, and not the enclosure of rolls. And we had some food. We also found some -- some frozen potatoes on the ground and everybody started making fires and -- and grilling these potatoes and usually get -- taking them out barehanded before they were cooked. And suddenly we were called to a -- a second appel. A contingent of SS guards came in a truck from -- from Buchenwald, replaced our Wehrmacht guards, and these officers took count. In the officer\u2019s staff car was an inmate, and even it was dusk I could recognize first the red triangle on his chest, and the red beret on his head. So as dusk was falling and the officers were chatting, I inched up to him. The guar -- the -- the -- the kapo was sitting on the running board of the SS staff car and I inched up to him and sort of crouched without looking at him, as -- as if there was no contact. And he said, \u201cDo you speak Polish?\u201d Yes. \u201cYou have a resistance group?\u201d Yes. \u201cSend me one of them.\u201d All I could say is, \u201cI\u2019m one of them, you can talk.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhatever you do, stall. Buchenwald is being emptied, trainloads of Jewish prisoners are -- are being taken -- taken in open cars. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, we don\u2019t have control.\u201d The re-resistance organization in Buchenwald was always very strong. \u201cWe don\u2019t have control, stall.\u201d So I shuffled back to the -- actually I ran back because a SS sergeant was kicking at me, ran back and when we were bedded down, I reported that to the kapo and the -- the others. How do we 8 stall? And this Czech government bureaucrat who was a high level -- I think he was deputy secretary of something in Czech Republic, he realized what we had to do, that the SS took e -- that up to that point the local SS were in charge, they could do whatever they wanted. Now a count had been taken up to Buchenwald, our SS had to deliver that many bodies, dead or alive when they arrive in Buchenwald. There\u2019s no -- no question. So if some people would hide, the count would come short. Well the -- the Gypsy orderly had been in -- in bel -- Berlsteed, he knew where the brick ovens were, and it was decided that three of -- he and two others would hide in the brick ovens at night. We woke up, our kapo -- our -- SS took a head count, it was three short. So they were thr -- dispatching people all -- all -- guards all over to search, we just stood at attention for a good part of the day. They he -- the SS lieutenant singled out the organization, he knew everybody. Others were allowed to -- to sit, to lie down, we were standing. He threatened to start killing us. Nothing happened. He s -- that\u2019s when he sent all but four to six guards for another search. And that was when I thought that they -- he -- that Vladya, Russian off-officer would yell one word and the breakout would start. I knew that. Facing the guards were all the -- the sharpshooters with their heavy knives. And I expected that those people would -- would kill the guards and get their guns and s -- and face the other guards coming back. And then, for the first time that I recall, we heard the sound of -- of gunfire from the west. I -- I don\u2019t recall having it er -- having heard it earlier. I don\u2019t know how -- how far the front was, I -- I never checked. I could check by date on where the front was. But anyhow, the SS chickened out, and decided to march us out. Long, torturous, very difficult walk up the steep slope. Buchenwald means beech forest, and the camp 1s at the tip of this somewhat sizable hill. The SS made the resistance group march in front and SS officer behind us and then rest of them. The inmates -- and it was definitely silence, and everybody was shuffling, and I decided I had 9 something to -- I had to do something, and I stopped as if to tie my shoe, and turned around and yelled pasnia in Russian, a song. And the Russians heard me and pretty soon the entire column was singing. And that was a tremendous relief. Me -- I mean, we all we -- on Sundays, the Sunday afternoons we were singing Russian songs, Polish partisan songs, Yiddish songs. Never Hungarian songs. Nobo -- nobody Hungarian wanted anything Hungarian. We were singing elements of -- of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony, because that was a -- one of the musicians from the Budapest orchestra taught it to us. So that singing started and that somehow got people the -- the strength to march the last couple of kilometers up -- uphill, and we arrived at the gate in Buchenwald."

On that day there were no more transports out, there were no more SS inside the camp, and the resistance organization controlled the camp. So -- so we were marched in one of the barracks and told to go to sleep, and I fell asleep.

In this depression control process in -- in the early -- in early 70\u2019s, I was chair of the adult education committee at our local temple.

In \u201994, there was this 60\u2122 anniversary commemoration in Subotica, very poorly advertised, because they didn\u2019t know whether the government would allow it, this was height of Milosevic. My sister and I decided that we had to go. The women in the family were against it, it was the fighting in -- in Bosnia. What if this is on CNN? What image will it project. So I decided I had to go. It turned out that Peter had a -- had a philosophy conference in Holland the following week, so he came along for that. \u201995 I was asked to give the keynote address at the International Conference on Computing and Civil Engineering in Berlin. The family again worried about my going, decided to delegate Greg to come with me, which was very useful. I mean, you know, he knew some of the people, they were short of a chair for one the sessions, so he sat -- he was a chair for the session. We went two days early and we drove down to Niederorschel and Buchenwald. And that -- that was very -- very satisfying. The night before Gregory wanted -- treated me to a nice dinner and at the dinner he said, \u201cDad, what is it that we are going to look for?\u201d And I took a napkin and I drew a map of the pla -- of the camp. And the next noon we were there, and except that somehow I tried to visualize the orientation with respect to the sun, I was off 180 degrees orientation, but other than that, that -- that was -- that -- the plan.
