Every 30 minutes the bell rings and the wing moves up on the assembly line from one station to the next station. That was the life. Food somewhat better than Auschwitz -- it\u2122s better than Auschwitz. Fortunately there was this absolutely first rate Czech cook. He was fat, he was really fat, who, I don\u2122t know how he did it. Kitchen scraps from the guard\u2122s food, I\u2122m sure table scraps from the guard\u2122s food. Vegetables that the si -- the town crew managed to steal or whatever. He provided some taste and some vari ety to the -- to the daily soup. So it was -- life was on the edge of being bearable, not quite. I still, after all of these years I think back with amazement at what people in this circumst ance still managed to do. Obviously there were shoemakers who could prepare your shoes with sole from discarded tires that the grounds crew found and shoe nails that were cut from scrap lumber. Obviously there were tailors who -- who with needle and thread gotten on the black market from the -- from the civilians could fix your clothes. Those kinds of things you expect. You don\u2122t expect to see these two brothers, Hungarian Jews deported from Holland, diamond grinders by trade, who ground prescription glasses out of bottoms of discarded milk bottles. Jewelers w ho took scraps of aluminum from the plant and created these carved boxes that could be traded. Beautifully carved, elaborately carved boxes. Some others made these very el aborate boxes out of pleated s-straw that could be bartered with the -- with the German civilians for ne -- needle , thread, soap, tobacco, few things. There were 99 about five or six -- maybe five to eight kids my age, mostly, as I said, Budapest with their fathers. One -- one kid I remember from Transylv ania with his father. These gentlemen decided that our education could not be interrupted, so after 12 hours wor kday, they sat us down, classes in algebra and French. Oh, everything, of course, was punishable by death, particularly smuggling o-out of the plant. Everybody who ha d a opportunity smuggled out scrap aluminum, scrap tools, sharpening them into weapons at night. The lights we nt out about half an hour after meals were served. You could hear for hours st one bowl -- pebbles being scraped against metal to create wa -- knives. I was very proud of a knife I made for myself out of a -- a -- a hacksaw blade. There were -- of the 700, probably a hundred were Soviet POWs. The Germans did not honor the Geneva convention, and the Soviet POWs were in the same boat as we were. And some of them were the strongest, in terms of trying to make weapons. Training for a uprising. Throwing knives. Many of them had fashioned th ese heavy knives with very heavy handles and practiced."

Lot of people would -- lot of people wanted to stage an uprising. We had counterfeit keys to all of the guards\u2122 rooms. That \u2122s not eas -- not hard to do. The inmates were -- were taking the -- the food across several locked doors. With the ke y you just chew some -- some bread dough in your mouth, make an impression in the key and there were locksmith who could duplicate that. The SS, the officers were living upstairs, we didn\u2122t think we could get to them. So there was a big debate and the kapo decided that -- that we didn\u2122t know where the American front was. It seemed to have sl owed down after the -- after the Battle of the Bulge, that we would march out. The kapo gave orders to the leaders of the brigades that everybody was free to escape if they could. The cook had some emergency ra tions. Chicory grounds, molasses, something that you could carry, and we were marched out."

            "answer": "So after eight days we arrived at another satellite ca-camp cal led Berlsteed, which some of the old time prisoners recognized. That had been a br ick factory which produced the -- the bricks for Buchenwald and for the other camps. So we had a little bit more freedom cause we\u2122re inside the fence, inside the barb wire fence, and not the enclosure of rolls. And we had some food. We also found some -- some frozen potatoes on the groun d and everybody started making fires and -- and grilling these potatoes and usually get -- taking them out barehanded before they were cooked. And suddenly we were called to a -- a second appel. A contingent of SS guards came in a truck from -- from Buchenwald, replaced our Wehrmach t guards, and these officers took count. In the officer\u2122s staff car was an inmate, and even it was dusk I could recognize first the red triangle on his chest, and the red beret on his head. So as dusk was falling and the officers were chatting, I inched up to him. The guar -- the -- the -- the ka po was sitting on the running board of the SS staff car and I inched up to him and sort of crouc hed without looking at him, as -- as if there was no contact. And he said, \ufb01Do you speak Polish?\ufb02 Yes. \ufb01You have a resistance group?\ufb02 Yes. \ufb01Send me one of them.\ufb02 All I could say is, \ufb01 I\u2122m one of them, you can talk.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Whatever you do, stall. Buchenwald is being emp tied, trainloads of Jewish prisoners are -- are being taken -- taken in open cars. We don\u2122t kno w what\u2122s happening, we don\u2122t have control.\ufb02 The re-resistance organization in Buchenwald was always very strong. \ufb01We don\u2122t have control, stall.\ufb02 So I shuffled back to the -- actually I ran back because a SS sergeant was kicking at me, ran back and when we were bedded down, I reported that to the kapo and the -- the others. How do we 108 stall? And this Czech government bureaucrat who was a high level -- I think he was deputy secretary of something in Czech Republic, he re alized what we had to do, that the SS took e -- that up to that point the local SS were in charge, they could do whatever they wanted. Now a count had been taken up to Buchenwald, our SS had to deliver that many bodies, dead or alive when they arrive in Buchenwald. There\u2122s no -- no question. So if some people would hide, the count would come short. Well the -- the Gypsy orderly had been in -- in bel -- Berlsteed, he knew where the brick ovens were, and it was decided that three of -- he and two others would hide in the brick ovens at night. We woke up, our kapo -- our -- SS took a head count, it was three short. So they were thr -- dispatching people all -- all -- guards all over to search, we just stood at attention for a good part of the day. They he -- the SS lieutenant singled out the organization, he knew everybody. Others were allowed to -- to sit, to lie down, we were standing. He threatened to start killing us. Nothin g happened. He s -- that\u2122s when he sent all but four to six guards for another search. And that was when I thought that they -- he -- that Vladya, Russian off-officer would yell one word and the breakout would start. I knew that. Facing the guards were all the -- the sharpshooters with their heavy knives. And I expected that those people would -- would kill the guards and get their guns and s -- and face the other guards coming back. And then, for the first time that I recall, we hear d the sound of -- of gunfire from the west. I -- I don\u2122t recall having it er -- having heard it earlier. I don\u2122t know how -- how far the front was, I -- I never checked. I could check by date on where the front was. But anyhow, the SS chickened out, and decided to march us out. Long, tortur ous, very difficult walk up the steep slope. Buchenwald means beech forest, and the camp is at the tip of this somewhat sizable hill. The SS made the resistance group march in front and SS officer behind us and then rest of them. The inmates -- and it was definitely silence, a nd everybody was shuffling, and I decided I had 109 something to -- I had to do something, and I stoppe d as if to tie my shoe, and turned around and yelled pasnia in Russian, a song. And the Russians heard me and pretty soon the entire column was singing. And that was a tremendous relief . Me -- I mean, we all we -- on Sundays, the Sunday afternoons we were singing Russian songs, Polish partisan songs, Yiddish songs. Never Hungarian songs. Nobo -- nobody Hungarian wanted anything Hungarian. We were singing elements of -- of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony, because that was a -- one of the musicians from the Budapest orch estra taught it to us. So that singing started and that somehow got people the -- the strength to march the last couple of kilometers up -- uphill, and we arrived at the gate in Buchenwald."

We were marched through the sanitation delousing area right at the top, and that was a good sign. And we were faced by a group of -- of political prisoners in the red beret coming to meet us. On that day there were no more transports out, there were no more SS inside the camp, and the resistance organi zation controlled the camp. So -- so we were marched in one of the barracks and told to go to sleep, and I fell asleep. And I don\u2122t have a very heroic closing because next thing I remember is in following day at mid-afternoon, somebody shook my shoulder to say that the Americans were there. 110"

He\u2122s department chair at University of California, Berkeley. Carol went -- got a Master\u2122s in public administration from Colu mbia. And from her student days on she has worked for the city of New York. She now works for the Department of Environmental Resources, and we joke that she\u2122s a more serious civil engineer than either Greg or I, because she manages about a billion dollars worth of construc tion money a year, for the sewers and s -- and water se -- tre -- tre -- water supply and sewerage for New York City. Peter went off to get a degree in -- in physics and math at Wesleyan, ca me out with a degree in English and classics. Went to Hopkins in their Center for the Humanities. And now has four appointments at Northwestern. German, comparative literature, philosophy and social sciences, I believe."

My sister and I decided that we had to go. The women in the family were against it, it was the fighting in -- in Bosnia. What if this is on CNN? What image will it project. So I decided I had to go. It turned out that Peter had a -- had a philosophy conference in Holland the following week, so he came along for that. \u212295 I was asked to give the keynote address at the International Conference on Computing and Civil Engineering in Berlin. The family again worried about my going, decided to delegate Greg to come with me, which was very useful.
