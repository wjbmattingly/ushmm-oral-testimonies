            "answer": "Yeah. My father's parents were bakers in Shedlitz. And he was born in 1900, also March the 23rd. But he didn't like the family because they were too religious for him, so when he grew up, he didn't want to be a baker, so he became a shoemaker. In 1923, he was trying to avoid the Polish army, he went to Berlin, and he worked in Berlin for four or five years, approximately, as a shoemaker. He was making fancy shoes there. After \u2014 \u2014 in 1928, he came back to Poland, and he married my mother. And I was born in 1928. After 1928, I was one years old, my father didn't like living in Shedlitz, so we moved to Aleksandrow Kujawski. This was not far. It's in Poland and . The reason he moved there, because they found out over here he could make a nice living making shoes and selling them to people that was from Poland. So, when I came there, I was one years old. My father started a business \u2014 well, actually, a Polish lady, because he was in business with my mother, making the shoes and selling them. So, I was right behind most of the time, and I spoke Polish. We lived there 'til 1938. In 1938, after the Kristallnacht, most of the people were living \u2014\u2014 there was only 150, 200 Jews, not too many Jews living there. Most of them were Polk Deutsche living there. 1938 became very bad for us, so we had to leave Aleksandrow, and we went back to Shedlitz, came to Shedlitz. So, my father's went to work for a sports factory. They were making sport shoes for skiing, ice skating, and soccer, and soccer balls."

            "answer": "I had the same education like I had in Aleksandrow, because I was not used to Jewish life, because most of the Jewish kids lived, like, in a ghetto. They had to go to Jewish schools. They didn't play with Polish kids. They were afraid. They were beaten up.  This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They couldn't ride a bicycle. They couldn't play ball. But I was used to that Polish life, so I registered myself, and I went to a school, to a Polish school for a year. In that school, I became very popular because I'm a very good soccer player and a ping\u2014pong player, and a volleyball player. So, they kept me there good. They treated me good. Now, the war broke out in 1939. In 1939, when the war broke out, was terrible. All the \u2014\u2014 half of Shedlitz was bombed. So, all my mother's relatives, most of them, got killed. So, they all moved in with us. So, they all lived with us in the ghetto, like for \u2014\u2014 like ten people living 1n one room."
