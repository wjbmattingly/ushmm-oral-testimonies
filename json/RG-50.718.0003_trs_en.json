            "answer": "In the class, the teacher came into the room and said, good morning. There were six boys and four girls, and I was one of the girls. We were all sitting in like a semicircle. The teacher was standing up by the window. He was looking \u2014 we were just waiting. The teacher didn\u2019t teach anything. We were wondering what was wrong. Then came a man from the government. It was very interesting, and he said to all of us, school students \u2014 he was explaining to us how to breathe. And you must go to the hospital for sterilization. And we said what? Why? What do you mean, go to the hospital for sterilization? He explained that when you grow up and get married, you won\u2019t be able to have a baby. We said, huh? It means we can\u2019t have a baby?

I told my mother, why is my father so affectionate and loves me so much, as compared with my other sisters and brothers? Why, what\u2019s wrong? Mother said, oh your father likes you just like everybody else. Everybody\u2019s equal. He loves to see you smile, though. He called me sunshine. Then, as the time became near, I remember very well, I was in the kitchen, and I was cleaning. My mother came and said, Helga, sit down. And she explained, you have to go to the hospital in two days. I said, I have to go to the hospital to get sterilized? I was calm. I kind of accepted it. My mother must have thought something was wrong, or that I was going to run away, or get crazy, but I was very calm. She said, how come \u2014 later she asked me, how come you were so calm? And I said, well, the other girls had it done, so I just accepted it, that it was fair. If they did, I guess it was my turn. My father cried. He refused to see me. He didn\u2019t want to hug me before I left home to go to the hospital. It was a very small, cute hospital, very nice place actually. Babies \u2014 only babies were born there.

Oh, he was not a member of the Nazi regime, so it didn\u2019t work. My father was the same way. I was a Girl Scout, and they were trying to force me to become a member of the Nazi party. I said oh, no. They said, you must. I said, why? Because you can speak with hearing people, and other \u2014 and children. Well, my mother taught me how to speak. They gave me the paper, told me I had to go to the flag \u2014 where the flag was, and sign some papers. I refused.

I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019Il stay. She said, bring the papers with you. You must go in there with your papers, and take them with you everywhere. My heart sank. I felt so much fear, for a very long time. I would sleep, and then I would walk to work. The Nazis, two of them, would stand there with their flags, as I walked by. I had the papers with me all the time. Should I go or not, should I go or not? I would pass them. I was afraid they\u2019d pull me back by my hair, but they didn\u2019t, I\u2019d say no. And every day this would happen, and I\u2019d be filled with fear as I walked past these two men with their flags. And they were bombing Hamburg.

But the aunt and uncle went to the American consulate, and at the consulate they asked for papers, and they told them about my husband and I, that we were deaf. They turned us down.

We told him about wanting to come to the States, and we said we were looking for freedom. And I had read books about America, and I was so impressed. This man said, good.

The first and second times, there were so many questions, and there was a \u2014 a list. And one of the questions that they asked, had you been a member of the Nazi party? And I answered, no. And in my mind I looked back, and I thought, if I had said yes, they wouldn\u2019t let us come to the U.S., if I had joined, way back when. This is true. So I\u2019m so happy that that never took place, that they didn\u2019t force me. So they swore us in.

I talked to my father, and he would just try to pacify me, and calm me down. He\u2019d say, don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. My father was very sensitive. My father\u2019s sister, my aunt \u2014 and I asked my aunt, I said, is Hitler bad? I went to Munich for a na \u2014 for a visit with another aunt, and I learned from them that Hitler was bad, and we should all be against Hitler, but we have to do it very quietly.

My father said, shh, shh. He was frightened. He said, you talk against Hitler, he\u2019ll put you away. They warned that the enemy could hear you all over, didn\u2019t matter where you were.
