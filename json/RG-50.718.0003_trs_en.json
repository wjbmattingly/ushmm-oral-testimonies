It was very interesting, and he said to all of us, school students \u0152 he was explaining to us how to breathe. And you must go to the hospital for sterilization. And we said what? Why? What do you mean, go to the hospital for sterilization? He explained that when you grow up and get married, you won\u2122t be able to have a baby. We said, huh? It means we can\u2122t have a baby?

And she explained, you have to go to the hospital in two days. I said, I have to go to the hospital to get sterilized? I was calm. I kind of accepted it. My mother must have thought something was wrong, or that I was going to run away, or get crazy, but I was very calm. She said, how come \u0152 later she asked me, how come you were so calm? And I said, well, the other girls had it done, so I just accepted it, that it was fair. If they did, I guess it was my turn. My father cried. He refused to see me. He didn\u2122t want to hug me before I left home to go to the hospital. It was a very small, cute hospital, very nice place actually. Babies \u0152 only babies were born there. A woman did the surgery. Gave me anesthetic and a shot, that everything was good and clean. After the surgery, I woke up, I was throwing up, and I could \u0152 I could feel something heavy on my stomach.

Oh, he was not a member of the Nazi regime, so it didn\u2122t work. My father was the same way. I was a Girl Scout, and they were trying to force me to become a member of the Nazi party. I said oh, no. They said, you must. I said, why? Because you can speak with hearing people, and other \u0152 and children. Well, my mother taught me how to spe ak. They gave me the paper, told me I had to go to the flag \u0152 where the flag was, and sign some papers. I refused.

I don\u2122t know how long I\u2122ll stay. She said, bring the papers with you. You must go in there with your papers, and take them with you everywhere. My heart sank. I felt so much fear, for a very long time. I would sleep, and then I would walk to work. The Nazis, two of them, would stand there with their flags, as I walked by. I had the papers with me all the time. Should I go or not, should I go or not? I would pass them. I was afraid they\u2122d pull me back by my hair, but they didn\u2122t, I\u2122d say no. And every day this would happen, and I\u2122d be filled with fear as I walked past these two men with their flags. And they were bombing Hamburg . And I needed a rest, and I thought I needed some relief. But I heard later that our teacher was dead from the bombs. Then, when I went t o the south, to join with my father and mother, I still had those papers with me. Then, during the war, then we saw the white flag. Bombs were everywhere. And now I could claim \u0152 come to \u0152 from south, I went to \u0152 could go to America . Before I came to America , in Germany , the Americans \u0152 the Germans, we lost the war. Hitler died; that was good. When we saw the white flag, it meant that we had given up, that there was no more war.

And after five years, I became an American citizen.

But the aunt and uncle went to the American consulate, and at the consulate they asked for papers, and they told them about my husband and I, that we were deaf. They turned us down. They say deaf was not allowed to come to the United States . I was very disappointed. Two years later, one American man from Boston \u0152 he was dea f himself, we became good friends. We told him about wanting to come to the States, and we said we were looking for freedom. And I had read books about America , and I was so impressed. This man said, good.

The first and second times, there were so many questions, and there was a \u0152 a list. And one of the questions that they asked, had you been a member of the Nazi party? And I answered, no. And in my mind I looked back, and I thought, if I had said yes, they wouldn\u2122t let us come to the U.S., if I had joined, way back when. This is true. So I\u2122m so happy that that never took place, that they didn\u2122t force me. So they swore us in.
