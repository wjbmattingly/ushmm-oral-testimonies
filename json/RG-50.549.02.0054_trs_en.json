            "answer": "I was born October 21, 1922, ow -- by coincident in Munich, because my mother was visiting her family there, she didn \u2122t expect. But I was raised -- I went through the Holocaust in Stanislawow in Poland, southeast of Poland."

            "answer": "First I have to start with a joke. My late parents called my Manya. First -- in the first grade I learned my name is Am alie when my teacher called out Amalie Petrenka to give me my report card. So this is the first time I learned that my name is Amalie, on -- and not Manya. When I started as a Christian Pole -- masquerading as a Christian Pole, I chose actually, my fictitious name, Felitsia Mewashefsky. I took Felitsia from Latin, Felitsia Felitsitakislak. Mewashefsky ma -- was my beloved writer, I liked her booked. So USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 3I dec -- and also, I had a German French r. When I was masquerading, I had to blend -- almost hundred percent the local population, to the Slavic r. So naturally, I tried to eliminate r from any possible word that I can -- that I can. Otherwise, probably, I would have remained Petrenka, because Petrenka is not a Jewish name. But, I have chosen Mewashefsky. I stayed with minash -- Mewashefsky till I got married to Norman s -- actually Naftali Salishitz at that time. So I became Amalie Salishitz. When we came to United States, he changed his name Salishitz to Salsitz, because his oldest brother, who was here for 20 years, at -- before m-my husband -- after my husband was born. So he wanted to have the same family name so he beca -- I became Amalie Salsitz."

            "question": "Let me ask you this, before we then go onto the duration. Who was Amalie Petrenka? Who was she as a girl, as a young person, and who was Felitsia Mewashefsky as a person? How did you f eel about the change?",
            "answer": "Fala -- ama -- Amalie Petrenka was a very happy go lucky type, with shiny eyes that I didn\u2122t know, but they were pointed out to me constantly, even during the war. I couldn\u2122t carry for a long time, a grudge, or hatred. I loved people, but Amalie Salsitz was also fighter, because she was the middle child, so she fought for her rights, because my older sister was only year and a half older than I, and the younger, one year younger. And my parents wanted always to keep me with my younger sister. So I learned to fight for my rights. And, little mischievous, rebellious, this was Amalie Petrenka. As matter of fact, I have done things to big displeasure of my parents, because sometimes I questioned their judgment. For example, I come from middle or above class, and I got -- we -- private USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 4schooling, very expensive. So, when my pare nts complained about it, and they said for this money they could have tr aveled in Europe, I dared to tell them I didn\u2122t ask to be born. This is not something in Europe, th at parents appreciate. Felitsia Mewashefsky became a very cautious person that -- full of fear, and she played th -- la -- a -- helhole lak reeda payatso. Laughing during the day with people, the pillow all wet during the night. And afraid to face people, still she was exposed every time to people. Many times I walked with downcast eyes, although as a ch ild I was told, supposedly, I have very beautiful eyes. I used to have very big one, and dark -- the eyelight -- eye white were even blue with the fair complexion and the fair hair, I guess it was outstanding, and the shiny eyes, like somebody who drinks. Here, I was downcast because I was afraid that people will recognize me. So, predominant factor in me was cautiousness, afraid, fearful, and in a way, also I decided I will fight Hitler with [indecipherable]. I will prove to him that it is all really nothing, that it\u2122s not true. I will excel so much, even as a Christian Pole, and be admired, to prove how false his theory was, which I succeeded. Many cases later -- maybe I will tell it i-if you want, later. So this was the Amalie . Still, this Felitsia Mewashefsky, if she could -- she c -- just coul dn\u2122t forget about the cultural life. Actually it was taboo to -- for Poles -- Christians, to go to movie houses, to go to resort, but Felitsia Mewashefsky was able to g -- venture to movie houses, no feedeutsch, no -- because I thought I\u2122ll be less caught there. And I went -- for example, I have done things, like I went to the copanna, which was forbidden for Poles, just to prove my point. I felt USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 5also, I play with fire later on. If so, let me be caught to -- not only because I w -- am Jewish, but I have done things that even the Poles were not permitted, the Christians."

            "question": "We will speak later about all three of you, but especially who Amalie Salsitz became in the United States, but for the time being, let\u2122s talk -- let\u2122s go back a -- or stay with the time just before liberation. Wh at was your state of mind, and what were the events that followed?",
            "answer": "Just few months before the liberation, we re this first German evacuation. Was a very trying time for me because one part of Poland was liberated half year before I was liberated. I was tempted to run over to the Russian side, or the Russian -- o-or the la -- Jeshuf townoof, and to shorten my time of expectation, meantime I could have been killed. But then I decided it\u2122s very risky, even to run to the Russian tine, so I will endure, and take my chances to legal -- to be liberated here, in Krak\u00f3w, where I survived. And also, I was offered, and requested, by my two companies, the first company vi -- m -- batonin -- isen bentongbal by Wilhelm Langert from Swekow saxon, to evacuate with him and his company. I refused on the grounds that I don\u2122t want to leave my motherland, Poland. And the same thing, first I was al so requested to evacuate with the second company, Myrader and Krauss, the Viennese company, to evacute -- or evacuate with them to Vienna, and also I refused on the grounds that I don\u2122t want to leave my motherland. I felt, why to endanger on my life now, towards the end. I didn\u2122t expect the terrible anti-Semitism which was in Poland after liberation. So I decided not to take any chances, but to stay put in Poland. But nights, I always was contemplating if -- what USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 6should I do? What is the right thing to do? To run to the Russian oc -- and now conquered, liberated territories. And one thing, I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s important. Well, I -- I learned that I\u2122m a little psychic. My dreams towards the end of the war were that I meet friends. Some friends embraced me, kissed me, were very happy to see me. My dearest friend, my childhood swee -- Ju lia Logbel, she pushed me away from her all the time. I couldn\u2122t understand this, this was in my dr eams. After the war, I found out that the people who pushed me away, like Alec Lamenstor, for example, my boyfriend who wanted -- we became fianc\u00e9, he pushed me away, they were all killed. Unbelievable. People that didn\u2122t survive pushed me away. And people who survived, even that there was not so closed, and I didn\u2122t think about th em, survived. And I met them after the war, and then I told them, \ufb01I knew you were alive, because you aka -- embraced me, you greeted me.\ufb02 So, this was the situation, and --"

            "answer": "No, at first rejection. I cried, I -- I felt very badly, and I used to say, \ufb01I didn\u2122t do anything wrong, why do you push me away?\ufb02 Like my best friend -- no, I didn\u2122t rationalize, only later, when I met, then I unde rstood that this was the reason. So this is just before the liberation, and naturally I had to be double cautious. One way it was easier for me, because according to my assumed things, and false papers, because I was born supposedly in Vilna, I was safer, because if I was caught na -- in -- in this period, first thing they checked with the parish and police. The parish was already in the Russian USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 7hands. And, on the police, I had a legitimate cancarte made out on the fa -- a-assumed name, but they didn\u2122t know it, and the s -- false baptismal paper. So I was safer in this respect, but still I had to be very, very careful. I had many incidents. Like after Myrader and hama -- this beton [indecipherable]. I -- after they evacuated. So I was referred to organization Torte, which built the -- you know, [inaudible] th -- they built -- to protect, you know, ditches, ditches, to protect the armies, and to slow down the onslaught of the approaching enemy. And my boss wanted me to evacuate with them, too. I refused. But there was one employee, an a-accountant. He himself looked Jewish too, German, ricedeutsch. And he said to me, \ufb01Fraulein Felitsia, what do you celebrate, Sabbat?\ufb02 I knew he recognized me, naturally I play dumb. Was still very dangerous period for me, very dangerous. I -- another one -- when -- in the new company, a Ukrainian, who worked in the bookkeeping department, turned to anothe r white Russian, and he said to him, \ufb01You know what? I suspect that Felitsia Mewashefsky is a Jewess.\ufb02 And he spoke it in front of the women with wh om I lived, who was the daughter -- daughter-in-law of the building where the company was located. And the yow -- white Russi an said, \ufb01Why do you go for her life? What did she do to you?\ufb02 So there were some decent people, but still was very dangerous to the last moment."

We will be back about two thr -- three months. Meanti -- you will manage the office, and you\u2122ll pay out the checks.\ufb02 He gave me the checks. Then he told me, \ufb01You will get some very important telephone call, and cooperate.\ufb02 But didn\u2122t explain what will be the phone call, from whom. Just after I think two or three days, I\u2122m not exact -- so sure now, I got a phone call from the camp\u2122s commandanten, from Krak\u00f3w military camp. And he ha -- just identify if this is the company Myrader and Krauss. I said yavolt. And the command came, \ufb01Springen sie de zoilen.\ufb02 Now, the -- I didn\u2122t know anything about zoilen. I know -- knew only that my co -- the company built bunkers a-around big office building -- German office. And I didn\u2122t know -- I saw the pyramids like form on the main thoroughfares, but I was not -- I-I-I -- informed, and I didn\u2122t know that this is the company our built, and those are the zoilen, but I connected immediately. Now, I had to think very fast. Had I been a German, I would have told them that they must do it themselves because my company evacuated. And then I said, \ufb01I can save this city being ruined.\ufb02 A-And -- not that -- a-after all, it is a historic sto -- city, Krak\u00f3w, but not that all -- all in the Poles, that they helped me to survive.

And I was thinking also for -- I analyzed the danger what will be for me, not to tell them to do themselves, and being I was not the only one left in the office. There was -- still was the lady Lydia Lu-Lublevska, the daughter-in-law. There was -- still was maintenance men, two chambermaids, and hi -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 9they didn\u2122t ask me who was speaking, so I thought I am not endange ring my life, because I can always deny receiving the phone call."

People may want to come to plunder. They wouldn\u2122t know to kill, but definitely to plunder. Don\u2122t open the iron gate till I will let you know.\ufb02 So when the three office rs came, we -- I saw them through the window, I told him not to open. And they knocked -- then they came again. When they came again, among them was one o fficer who looked like a Jew. So I said from this quarter cannot be any danger. So I will find out what they want, and I will explain what it is. So I told the man to open the gate, he let them in, they came to my office, and among them was my present husban d Norman Salsitz. Norman was in -- wi -- in a leather coat. Norman looks very Slavic. And after they checked who we are, they dwelt on me, they stop with me. And my husband started, a very nasty in -- interrogation. Finally, I got very mad. Who I am, I show the ID, it\u2122s impossible that I am Felitsia Mewashefsky, a Pole, to be a such sensitive job, that I\u2122m lying. So I said, \ufb01If -- so take USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 10me to your superiors.\ufb02 So he told me, \ufb01I am the superior.\ufb02 And thr-threatened me, and to frighten me, he a -- opened his coat where the -- his gun was there, a revolver. And I said, \ufb01For God sake, it\u2122s towards the end of the wa r. I don\u2122t have to take anything from such a anti-Semite.\ufb02 I got annoyed, and I called the o fficer who looked Jewish to the other room that I want to talk to him. In the other room when we came, he se -- asked me, \ufb01Well, who are you?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I\u2122m Jewish, I am th e same that you are.\ufb02 \ufb01How do you know?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Look at your face.\ufb02 You know, this the saying in Europe. So, \ufb01From where are you?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01From Saint Swabof, from where are you?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01I am from Krak\u00f3w.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Krak\u00f3w, we had many refugees during th e Russian occupation, and one of them I befriended was in my Jewish gimnasium, by the name Oskar Margolies.\ufb02 Lo and behold, this Oskar Margolies was his first cousin. From all the people in the world, what an accountant. Ver -- very emotion from Miskey. Naturally, he ask about his fate, and then we went in. He came over to Norman, and told him to leave me alone, that I\u2122m okay. And he whispered that I am Jewish. Norman didn\u2122t believe till he started interrogo-gated me -- interrogating me again, because he knew th is Yamen Miskey to be a womanizer, he thought, God knows. And he -- he sta -- th-then somehow, in back of his mind, he said maybe, maybe she is Jewish. And it was very danger -- the situation was not stable to reveal that I am Jewish, because in case the Russians retreat, the Germans come, then they -- I\u2122m exposed as a Jew, and they kill me. Oo -- iha -- it happened many times. So this is one, he decided to be more careful. He ask if I s -- speak other languages. I said yes. \ufb01What?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Russian, German,\ufb02 and I couldn\u2122t say Hebrew, because I was afraid USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 11they will understand. So he switch to his broken English, as little as he knew, what nationality I am. I said I am Je wish. He didn\u2122t believe, so he started again about Jewish religion, and -- and custom, and then he aske d me [inaudible] about the very sacred day in our Jewish life, Yom Kippur, the big atonement day that every Jew knows, and he asked me what we say on Yom Kippur. When he asked me this que stion, only a Jew kn-knows. Then I knew that he is Jewish, t oo. I answered immediately Yom Kippur, then, with tears from my eyes I said, \ufb01You too? You too Jewish?\ufb02 And this is how we met. So then we -- but, because we [indecipherable] he sa -- I told him I speak Hebrew too, and I called him names in Hebrew, I did. So he thought being I\u2122m young, that the Germans taught me Hebrew in order I should spy on Jews and give them out -- not that I am Jewish, because they have done it. So they taught me Hebrew so perfect in order to fish out the poor Jews who were masquerading as Gentile. So then we switched to Polish, and then he stated the reason why he came. And s -- th -- I said, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t you tell me right away? Why did I have to go through such interrogation, and you know it?\ufb02 I was so aggravated. And so I took him to the office across, because the -- those were the living quarters, I took him to -- across the hall, to the office, and I gave him the plans of the pyramids, of the columns that were erected, because there was a master plan, so they didn\u2122t -- they could deton -- detonate it. And this is how I met Norman. Started with hate. He actually came to kill me, and as matter of fact, they were discussing who is the one who will kill me, because they were afraid after I give the plans I can get in touch with the ca -- m-military commandant, and tell them already that they have the plans. A-And USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 12even my husband felt badly because it came upon him to kill, and he felt he never killed a woman, even if she\u2122s German, even all his sisters were killed by the Germans, all his gra -- nieces and nephews, but still he couldn\u2122t bring himself. So this is the story. From hatred, for wanted to kill me, we fell in love, we got married, and here we are, married, will be in October, 54 years."

So, Norm -- it was very hard to get into medical school, s -- priority had only the one who started already. So No rman, because of high position, was able for me to work out, I should be accepted.

And I told Norman, \ufb01I never was, I\u2122m not, and for this I will not put the ti -- I am in order USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 13to be accepted.\ufb02 But because of his connections, and high position, I was accepted. But I had to go through ast -- extra -- you know, old subjects, because I didn\u2122t have any papers. I had to take all the exams, [indecipherable] from -- to make my matriculation, I was accepted. But then, Norman couldn\u2122t stay in Krak\u00f3w because of his position, and he traced a lot of Akar, Poles from the national government in London, whose aim was to get rid of Germans and Jews, and kill the lot.

So Norman supplied for me, and I used to go -- I used to find them from Plasz\u00f3w, living in one room, four or five, sick, emaciated, bringing food, helping. And others -- and through grapeline they found out that I have clothes I can give them, and they used to come. So was mostlal welfare. Not official, but wel-welfare. And then in Breslau, I could have enrolled again to medical school, but I saw the anti-Semitism in Poland, and I felt it\u2122s a Communist Poland. I didn\u2122t survive the war to go from one jail to another. And my only goal and strength to survive was to be reunited with my family that I had at that time in Palestine, from Germany. My grandmother, my sister, my mother\u2122s brothers, cousins, uncles. So this gave me the strength, but I -- because I knew, although I\u2122m the sole survivor from the family who was in Poland during the Holocaust, but I am not an orphan completely, because I still had a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 14good maternal grandmother and uncles in Palestine at that time, and I will be able to be reunited with them. So I felt, how can I stay in Poland? Here I endanger my life, because the Poles started the pogroms, killing of Jews. Personna non grata. This is not a reason why I survived. And because legally we couldn\u2122t leave Poland, so we escaped illegally to Munich. So this is -- otherwise there were gatherings with struyas -- survivors, and really we felt like family, like blood relations becaus e we were -- like Imann, he lost everybody, but didn\u2122t have even a brother, anyone. At least I had, they didn\u2122t. So we clung to each other. We sha -- we looked for solace in each other\u2122s arms. So this was till we escaped -- till I arranged a escape. First my husband, because my brother-in-law decided that he has a store, and has to liquidate. So the wife doesn \u2122t belong to the husband. I had to stay with my older brother-in-law, till he liquidates me, then my husband escaped. I arranged for him. And later we found -- we were supposed to meet in the Jewish communion house in Munich, but unfortunately, my husband was not there. After I struggled, after I almost got killed crossing illegally the border, because I brought some of our belongings."

So I felt all roads USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 16are leading to Rome. Doesn\u2122t matter which I take. Being that Jews had an opportunity to - under joint certific -- group certificate to immigrate to United States, I decided to take what comes first, and then I will go to Palestine. What I have done. Now, to United States is a story I must tell you. We know we cannot stay in Germany. Each face I scrutinized, I couldn\u2122t look -- and it was a terrible emotiona l -- terrible emotional for me, because everyone I looked, is this the killer? Is this the killer of my parents, my family, my sister, my beloved ones? Oh, we knew we cannot stay in Germany. We tried to make it as brief as possible, but in order to immigrate to Un ited States, we needed papers to get visa. Ironically, the Germans who applied had all the papers, they didn\u2122t have any difficulties, and they were processed very fast. We survivors, who didn\u2122t have a ny papers, or the one who survived the concentration camp. Or like I, who had to leave everything, any scrap of paper which will identify me, and be under assumed, I didn\u2122t, so we couldn\u2122t be processed, we couldn\u2122t be -- get -- obtain a visa. So finally, my husband and I, we decided to approach the general council, e xplain the situation, what it is, and that something must be done. Some Jews bribed th e secretary -- again, who was the secretary? A German Christian. And they -- some -- she let them go -- approach to co -- to present it to their ambassador of council. So one day, lunch time, we accosted the general council, by the name Clark, and we ask him in our English, broken English, that i-if -- for audience, we want to explain some situation. After we explain to him, he got up, he was very tall. He put his hands on our heads, and said, \ufb01Now, set children must come to United States.\ufb02 He changed the law that it is far -- enough if two eye witnesses, notarized, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 17will give testimony that they know the person, where it ca -- was born and when. And this will be accepted. So, in a way, we changed the law. And we helped a lot of survivors this way. So finally, when our papers came through -- meantime was very hard for my husband too, because -- in the trolley cars and the many compiljamas -- complaints, so many -- so many refugees, that they brought them as slave workers was okay. So my husband started fights, fistfights, killi -- you kn ow, he got bruised, he will not let it go. I souta -- so the ground is very hot, we have to leave. So luckily, after we got the visa, we were sent to the camp -- immigration camp in Br emenhaven, but we have to stay there for half year because in United States was a coal strike. So till we be able to leave, it was January."

But the last day, when we s -- were told that we are approaching the Statue of Liberty, and -- New York harbor, natural we dressed up all in our best, and we went on the deck. And this was some moment, seeing the Statue of Liberty, the torch, the liberty. Ah -- we were elated, finally we are liberated. We came -- we arrived, we didn\u2122t have to go to Ellis Island, because at that time they checked us in Germany, in the special office of immigration, and when we arrived at the pier, they grouped us according to the alphabet.

Well, we stated for a month, I think, till we got our apartment. But about a house, another story. In my dreams -- it\u2122s unbelieva ble, I never thought about United States, because my whole family in Palestine, and I thought that after liberation, we\u2122ll go straight there. I saw a red brick house. I never had seen such style of house in my town in Poland.

So we stayed with him for a month, then by coincident, traveling on the subway, we were approached by the old -- elder man Italia. His name was Rosario. With broken English he asked us who are we, and so. And we told him that we are surv ivors, refugees, and we are looking for apartment. He offered his apartment -- he was by 72 years old.

Norman was able, because of my salary later, to quit the job in the ink factory, and he went in to peddling, on installment. He went to the Polish section, which was here in New Jersey, Jersey City. And he looks like a Pole, and they thought he is Polish, and Norman doesn\u2122t wear a wedding band, probably you noticed, so he was single, on the market. An y woman who wanted, really, thought she has chances with him, this is Norman. So this is the story.

So nights he went to school USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 31to learn to be a decorator, and here he -- being now he had the capital, so he took in a German -- an Italian builder. The builder didn\u2122t have any money, but he taught him, and they worked together. So this how he learned. He started, and he flourished, he built.

Do you n -- I -- no one who didn\u2122t go through it doesn\u2122t understand the feeling to be a minority, and be picked, always sacrificial lamb for anything goes wrong. Here I among -- I\u2122 m e-equal to others. And this such a wonderful feeling. I -- and so proud, and especially I was privileged to watch the development of this county since \u212249. At least every two years we were there, from the very hard times, economically how the county built up, and physically from the desert how cities flourished and built up. And how people really, also, were able to live differently, and the culture. One thing is always very nice, high standard, how people were informed, well-read, and in the pleasure to discuss with them. And there\u2122s a pride, pride to be among people equal -- intellectual people, very bright people. Even they are algart. But this is the thing, the characteristic of the Jews. And -- and pushy, because otherwise they wouldn\u2122t survive. But you accept it, but you are proud what you see, what they achieved. And anybody tries to downtr od, even when the state was proclaimed, you know, the American wanted to actually is -- dissolve it, and to say Israel stop, you know, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 32to exist, you know, because of the Arabs. And oil, do -- we su rrounded with Arabs, always the danger. They wanted to throw, and still want to throw it to the sea. So there is a feeling -- I feel responsible. I remember when the Six Day War was, how I cried. I wanted to bring all the children, because of security. I was afraid, so many armies, what will happen? They will squash, they will kill. So I had wanted to save the children at least, but thank God, it was very successful. Then the Yom Kippur War, I lived through it, okay? I share the fate of the Israelis. Every election, every news. It\u2122s very important to me, the security of the country."

And not always I\u2122m so proud, because I am still critical. I lo -- don\u2122t like the bully. I am very unhappy now with the situ ation with Kosovo, not that [indecipherable] had to be stopped, but defi nitely not by bombs, not by breaking sovanti of a county. I don\u2122t like it.

Now, with NATO, and entering s -- Yugoslavia, Serbs, and everything, I am afraid that may backfire. I learned history repeats himse -- itself. Look the Roman empire, Hellenistic empire, Britain, the big ones. Th ey reach the peak, and then it goes down. I will not live to see, and I hope my children and grandchildren will not live, but unfortunately, this is how history is. And we shouldn\u2122t pay for the mistakes we making. Hurts me that we Americans are not to like around the world, because we bully everybody. This hurts me, because really, it\u2122s the only democracy, not the best, but is the best comparing to others, and the opportunities and the freedom, it gives everybody, according to abilities. The only thing really what a newcomer cannot be is a president. But take Kissinger, take others. If you\u2122re just capable -- take us. After all, with no help from anybody, we are very comfortable. All the doors -- I must say almost all the doors were open to us. Okay, my was Jewish educ ation, my husband was self-employed. No doors closed. I see my son-in-law, brilliant, he was accepted to Harvard, he is working, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 34he is on staff of Harvard Hospital. My dau ghter is a lawyer. She could have been the biggest one if she wanted. The doors are open, according to your ability. It\u2122s -- now they start little bit a quota, but it wasn\u2122t a quo -- when I came was still the quota, Norman\u2122s nephew was a quota, because then, when he wanted to go, I remember, he was accepted to -- to Columbia, and there was a quota, but no more. Now they start little bit, but it\u2122s very high position, I am very proud again, how many Jews achieved very high positions now. They couldn\u2122t before. And so I am pr oud that -- watching the progress. I\u2122m proud that I am a country which is not controlled by the church, and this why I wi -- we selected to come here, not to Latin America. Why I mentioned la -- South America, because argen -- Argentina was my bro -- father\u2122s brother, who immigrated from Stanislawow in \u212228, and he was quite well off, established. Unfort unately, when I came to United States, a year later he died, age 45 on cancer of stomach. But he wanted to bring us over to Argentina, and I said, \ufb01Nevermore I go to a country, especially a Catholic country, and controlled by the church.\ufb02 And th ank God, here is the country, if I don\u2122t like I can speak up. And if anybody tells me -- like, I had the neighbor here, German descendent, Mr. Spiegel, Charlie. And once our dogs had fight when I had the dog. He said, \ufb01You Jew, you go to Palestine.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01You Germ an, go to Germany.\ufb02 So everybody came from someplace, doesn\u2122t matter if you was born here. The only really Americans are the Indians, so it\u2122s a wonderful feeling. You\u2122re not afraid to speak up. And if somebody insults you, you\u2122re just free to fight back.

            "answer": "Yeah. The only question I have to know, Amalie Salsitz, now presently a old woman, who retired, who lives just to -- for pleasant things, to -- as much as she can take out of life, or the Amalie who came, because of there\u2122s a big difference. The one who arrived had to est -- had to establish herself. Without no help from anybody. So she had to be aggressive. She felt satify -- satisfied, accomplished, because in her profession she was very happy. As a mother having a daughter, a good daughter, the relationship was nice. There was some, like daughter mother missed, but straight in the time of the drugs, my daughter was not. She was in Boston, age 17 , she graduated earlier. She became a lawyer. I\u2122m happy, successful, and there\u2122s respect. I am not a very active person. I love -- I\u2122m a very private person, luckily, b ecause Norman has to be at every organization, at every meeting, but not only to be a member -- a member, a paid member I am also. B\u2122Nai Brith, Hadassah, Sisterhood. But I don\u2122t -- I come very seldom, unless it\u2122s something very important. Otherwise I prefer my privacy, my book I enjoy immensely, I lose myself. I like the privacy, also maybe -- maybe there\u2122s the reaction to the war time, when I didn\u2122t have a private corner where I could be myself, and I realized this is why I\u2122m such need of privacy. Like so many, especially women, like to dine in the restaurants, and this is the biggest thing, go away for a weekend. I like my meals when I cook, not that I am such a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 36good cook, and not that I l ove to cook. But I have my home. Because during the war again, I only had eat with the ration card, masquerading as a Gentile. In the restaurant, bring the potato in the restaurant, and I longed for a cook -- home-cooked meal. I remember when my landlady was making her s oup, the aroma, the fragrance, and I ask, my goodness, will it be time when I will be able to make my own soup, my own tea? This probably shaped me. So till now, like I said, I like the privacy. I like people very much, but I\u2122m as happy when I\u2122m by myself. It\u2122s no t that I have to be beneath. Again, like Norman functions the best, he\u2122s a ham when there\u2122s a lot of people. When he doesn\u2122t have a big group, at least four people listeners, he likes to sulk little bit, and sul -- and really y-you wouldn\u2122t believe the joker, the storyteller than can be so quiet, that home you have to pry out from him a sentence. But most comedi ans are that way, I heard from other women too, that they\u2122re so good when they entertain, but home they don\u2122t open their mouth. So -- and -- but I am content. I love to be w ith my family. Naturally, with my daughter means the whole world to me. My grandsons. And even I have relationship from the beginning with my cousin Petrenka. He is now 70, and he\u2122s a year and a half older than I am. As much as we can, we spend holidays together -- together. It\u2122s harder to travel. And also with my friends still from home, I\u2122m still in touch, whoever is alive. They moved now, many of them to Florida, because they\u2122re old. Some are older. One -- one is 89, wa -- or 80. I have only my friend, to -- two that are my age. Mostly they were in the woods, they were married. But we in touch, and again, it\u2122s like family. And on the phone, I -- I don\u2122t like to call too much. I told -- I think I mentioned to you. I don\u2122t have USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 37the patience to talk too much on the phone, but I will call to check how they are doing. I like celebrations. You know, at to -- attend when sp -- especially from family. It means a lot to me. Like se -- Thanksgiving, on my daughter, or my cousin Leo Petrenka\u2122s daughter, she makes it, Joyce, in her house, means a lot to me. I don\u2122t like big gatherings when the people are strange. Like my daughter ha -- Norman likes a lot of people. And when we go there for Passover, she has at least 32 people. So it means -- we are only by seven family, the rest are friends. I don\u2122t mind close friends, 15 people, but the friends bring -- but she invites with their parents, total strangers. And I feel a celebration of holiday, I want with close people. So I stopped going, and I gave a ultimatum. All you make for family. I\u2122d rather go to Joyce here in Long Island. I don\u2122t want to come holiday and meet a lot of strange people. And this is how to celebrate. But remarkably, and astonishly, I read in the Jewlson Post that the survivors as in Israel, was an article complain about the same thing. When they go to celebrate family with family, there is no family, because so many, and they are not to o com -- not comfortable, but not so happy. They want the warmth. We are missing, lacking the warmth, family warmth. And --"

And the other woman, who took me in, my f-father\u2122s partner\u2122s wife. I search for her, but I had the wrong address, I couldn\u2122t find her. Till USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 43finally, 11 years ago, a friend of Norman, a Po le, located her. So we sent invitation -- at that time she was already 76 years old, and we invited both of them to United States as our guests. They were here for three weeks. They were honored, they got -- we live in Springfield, they got, from the city hall, they got the key of the city. They were invited to -- they gave testimony, and for Yale, whitesafe, they ga -- they were invited to ADL. They -- we spoke there. The Polish consulate was there. We have even the tapes from there. And naturally we took them sightseeing, and they met my daughter, and nis -- to old -- Mrs. Eezhaniecekov, the older one who helped me, said to me, \ufb01You stayed in my house three weeks, I stayed in you, now we even.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01No, we are not even. You harboring me endangered your life, and the life of your whole family by keeping me. I invite you, normal times, materially it didn\u2122t matter, I have the facilities, and um -- I just hosted you as a friend, without any fear of repercussion. So we are not even. I still am in debt to you.\ufb02 And then, also a -- I would like to tell that after the war, when we met and we got married, we got married under our re al name, but not officially. We had the reception, people we didn\u2122t know -- the only one that we knew, it was my boyfriend -- my late boyfriend\u2122s sister Sasha. The rest we didn\u2122t know the people, big officials, and big -- in our apartment. So Norman and I, we promised ourselves, if we will live to age to be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary, we may -- will make it like a wedding, and thank God we able to fulfill our dream, our wish, and four years ago, I made -- we made a big -- for 120 people, a reception. Like a wedding, except that the -- we didn\u2122t exchange the vows, the -- and my sister came from Israel, Babka. My cousin, first cousin from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 44Argentina came with her husband. My cousin from Toronto, Canada came. My family from Chicago, from Dallas. Not -- not only my daughter from Boston with the family. And from Washington, from all over. This meant so much for me. The warmth, the firs time. And the speeches were just beautiful. Again, I missed my sister. My parents I understood, they wouldn\u2122t have lived, normally, to be able to participate in our party. But my sister was only 17. She wo uld have been 72 years old. She probably would have been a grandmother. And I missed her, and her family that she never had. But it was a very big affair, and I was -- it -- and also the survivor\u2122s friends, came, who ard. So at least there was a celebration. But like any other celebration -- on my daughter\u2122s wedding, too, was a -- being she\u2122s a only child, it was done in Shor t Hills, which i-is here in New Jersey, exquisite place, beautiful. But when I walked to the aisle with my husband, I didn\u2122t have tears from joy, only missing my parents, who couldn\u2122t be at the wedding. So, on every happy occasion, there\u2122s this sadness, that lo -- that -- the loss of the dear ones. Naturally, also, my sister came from Israel with her la te husband, but still, the other sister wasn\u2122t -- the -- that she could have been -- at that time my parents could be still alive. So no celebration ha -- is -- it sure is supposed to be a hundred percent happy, it\u2122s never. Also, because outwardly, we live a normal life. I can\u2122t complain. We were quite successful in the United States in many respects. Acknowledged, respected in our community, in our Temple. We publish a lot, we known people. Say as much as we can, we quite charitable, we known. But during the night, where we cannot control our thoughts, the dreams are still terrible. We are still chased, are still killed, and we caught. And this is when one USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 45awakes the other. One spouse -- or my husba nd e -- or I -- my husband. Because we screaming still. But I guess this will be till the day till we die. People thought we -- we thought that with time there wouldn\u2122t be bleeding so much , but it\u2122s not true. It was with us. So we will ask, can we ever forgive, and forget. And I tell, I cannot forget. I don\u2122t have any right to forgive, because the victims are not there to forgive. I\u2122m still alive, but they are not there, so I don\u2122t have the right to forgive. Peopl e ask me if I\u2122m religious, if I believe in God. I say, I observe, I\u2122m not so religious. Iv -- but I believe in God. I cannot prove that there is not a God. In moments of distress, I will still turn to God. But I cannot say that I love Him. I cannot say that I hate Him, but I don\u2122t love Him. I still questioning, where was He, that He permitted such atrocities. If I found peace, no. I cannot. Not because nor -- I -- I can sed -- I can generalize, in United States, we didn\u2122t get any help how to cope. First we were immersed in life, to establish us, as we are busy. So the days were easier. But in -- older we get, and now when we -- I am retired, my husband\u2122s semiretired, it\u2122s still so fresh, and so painful. And we try to reason, doesn\u2122t work. And also by association. We traveled extensively, except I must -- I shouldn\u2122t brag, except India, and South Africa, we were all over the world. When I saw in schools children led by teacher, I didn\u2122t see Jewish children led by teacher. I saw that the children left to the Umshlaktplatz. Dr. Kolchuk\u2122s children. Ther e were times in the beginning, not now any more, when I was in a place with a lot of people, especially when there was commemoration of the Holocaust, few thousand people. I was always afraid to -- that there will be --a bomb will be thrown in, or fire, because I remember some of my USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 46friend\u2122s family were put in the synagogue, and let -- and burn ed to -- the synagogue, bur -- and burn in the synagogue. I was afraid of gatherings. And many times when I see -- when I saw a dogcatcher, I associated it with the chasings, and catching the Jews, hunting for them. I remember my neighbor had a lot of cats, so the see -- SPS called her, told her to put cages. And when I saw it, I started to cry, I said, \ufb01Open it, I cannot see it.\ufb02 Because when I -- me -- I -- we -- we caught. Till now, when I see cattle cars, picture [indecipherable] how my dear one were caught in it. See my mother was not sent to concentration camp, nor my father, we didn\u2122t have any in my town, Stanislawow, when we were under -- because we were under the Russians. The Germans had excuse for the war that we are all Communists. And they just killed us in ditches, the -- dug in the ghetto, on Jewish cemetery, we saw it. On e different excuse, different, supposedly reason, every time. So you see, this -- you can not erase something like this. It stays with you. And the same thing with food, when I give, till now I cannot face food, because I remember the times we starved, and moi -- my poor daughter said -- she was quite chubby one ch-child, because she said, \ufb01You always reminded me how we -- you starved, and the children in ghetto star ved, and you always make me eat,\ufb02 which is true. I cannot, because -- so there are many things that shaped me, remained with me. Again, Imelda has a lot of shoes. I stuff too. Not as many as she has, and clothes. In case I cannot buy because I didn\u2122t have, and the same with food. And my daughter with food also. She\u2122ll buy a lot she doesn\u2122t eat. God forbid th at something should happen, her children shouldn\u2122t have food. So certain things remained with us. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 47"

Only child, with older parents than others. I was 34 years old, Norman 37, were in this time -- not now, but at that time particular, women had really children 25, 24, young mothers. I was older, and she was a good girl, she was obedient, she liked to, but inside, probably, she rebelled. And because the only child, like she said, I smothered her with love. So when she was 17, she wanted USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 48to -- she was accepted to college, because she graduated one year before, being she wanted to go graduate school, and she was a very good student, they experiment here in Springfield. So I let her go, because I felt she needs to get away, to be on her own. I was hurt when she decided to settle in Boston, because I\u2122ve told her, \ufb01You\u2122re our only child, I would like to watch you children, my grandchildren growin g up.\ufb02 I\u2122m -- I know -- after all, we are not such young parents to start o ff, we were by 60 something.

They actually call now more, once a month when we give them allowances, you know? But not how we feel, how we are. There\u2122s not the closeness, which hurt me very much so. Because this is the whole world. My daughter was the whole world for me. There was --every place we went, we took her along. As a matter of fact, she liked to go USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 49so -- so much, that sometimes when there was a wedding, and she was not invited, I make believe I am sick so she can go with my husband, okay? And it\u2122s not so because of distance. We are very candid to each other. There\u2122s respect, there is kind of love. It is. But it\u2122s not the warmth that I expected."

Hans Krieger, who was the chef of Gestapo for -- in my town Stanislawow, and am -- Brand, and then Doust. As a matter of fact, I witnesses willful killing by Doust. But something happened to me. When I was called the first time, I went by myself. The second time they called me during the vacation, I didn\u2122t have with whom to leave my daughter, I took her along. Then -- but each time I got notificati on from the German consulate, they arranged the tickets, everything.

And I didn\u2122t hear anything, why I didn\u2122t come, nothing, and no ti ckets. Luckily. Then, I was asked to come to Vienna, to testify against two brothers, Mauer, Willie and Hans, who were really very cold. But one of them, the older one, wenald was killing in ghetto aktion action. He knew me because I had to work as a chambermaid in apartment downstairs by this Doust, and he saw -- know -- knew me by sight. In this particular case he saved my life. He USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 51pushed me inside, not I should be taken into transport. And then, also, I was able to save my father, the whole family, because I told this my father, later, after, they believe, because my father was very young looking, I saved him.

Luckily, majority didn\u2122t do it, they were afraid. But somehow he was intrigued. I told you I had the dark eyes, but my eyes -- and he recognized me, because when there was the killings, when we went to the ghetto, they discharge all the chambermaids. We can work as slave labors, but not in their private homes . He recognized me. So I felt, if I go to testify -- I really didn\u2122t know what decision to make. If he still recognized the eyes, and he said, \ufb01Look, here I saved this Jewess, and how she\u2122s paying my back.\ufb02 I felt my duty is to testify, but I couldn\u2122t bring myself to do it, because I didn\u2122t. I didn\u2122t go. Till now I\u2122m bothered, because he killed so many. After he saved me and my family, I witnessed the killing of my neighbor. She was walking on Umshlaktplatz. From behind, she was walking, he shot her. Just for pleasure. It was not that he was ordered, it was not that it was the aktion, where they used. But I couldn\u2122t bring myself."

Everyone\u2122s supposed to be equal. No. So you had to be a daughter of a -- a streetcleaner, to be -- become something, and God forbid if you are middle class again, the door was closed. As a matter -- I had very bad experience, if not of my lat -- late sister Celia, who was so beautiful, we would have been sent to Siberia. We got paragraph 11 . They were supposed to take away our a-apartment. I wanted to study, and I wanted to become a doctor, they didn\u2122t expe -- accept me. So they only accepted me as a teacher because they were short on teachers. But when they found out my background , even from this they expelled me, unless I pay tuition, which was more then if my father made in two months. So where\u2122s the equality. Race too. Unless -- when you a Jew, you were a Jew. It was written in the kemkart yevari. So not that we had the door open fo r us. Actually, in my part, the Ukrainian got all the rights, he became the big one. The Pole was the second. It -- again on the third place was Ivray, the Jew. And the fear. I -- they blackmailed, for example, us students. They had special USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 55department political spedsjust. And they called us in, especially the one like middle class, that unless you denounce your friend, unless you find something, they make you a informer, blackmailer, and they blackmail you. I was afraid to speak. Only home, to parents. And the fear that they will ship us to Siberia. Then I thought it\u2122s very bad, but lo behold, I didn\u2122t know what is awaiting me when Hitler came, when the Germans occupied. So at least this one, they let you liv e.

            "answer": "Yes, there are lessons that can be drawn from the Holocaust. What intolerance can do, what hatred can do, how destructive it is. But, if the world learned something, I\u2122m sorry to tell you not. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2122t have Rwanda, we wo uldn\u2122t have Cambodia, and we wouldn\u2122t have other mass killings that I don\u2122t know how to stop because there\u2122s so many now o-occur in this world. So there\u2122s still deep hatred, still, and I don\u2122t know -- trying -- we try, but the difference is, when the Armenians were killed by the Turks, the world stood by quietly, and it was not later -- there were not -- no -- no trials, and not too much really, in the press. With the Holocaust --"

This is why Hitler felt that he can do it, because what\u2122s to the byhear, when there was killing of people, and -- and here there were Christians ki -- Moslems killing Christians. The church stood by, and everything. So he thought he will have a free hand -- and he was right -- to do with the Jews. But now with the Holocaust, because there was a trial. It\u2122s so much written and done about it to educate the people, I do hope -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 57I do hope that it will not occur. At least our President Clinton cited as a reason to bomb, and to enter f-f-f -- for [indecipherable] country, because that the world stood by during the Holocaust. I don\u2122t accept it, but still this was an excuse. So let\u2122s hope. And the trials that they have now in Geneva, and ha -- Hague. Maybe this will prevent."

Why he permitted this? If so, I will take him seriously. Had he acted the same way with the others."
