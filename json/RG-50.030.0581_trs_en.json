Dr. Eaton, can you start by giving your first name as it appeared originally, as you were named in Germany, your name in Germany and why don\u2019t you give us the names of your immediate family as well?",
            "answer": "All right. I was born as Joseph Wexler in Nuremberg, Germany in \u2014 not in a hospital, because it wasn\u2019t safe to go to hospital, if you could afford to have delivery at home. So I was born in Luxfeld(ph) three, across the park. My father was Jacob Wexler, and my mother Flora Goldschmidt Wexler. And I have three brothers, Siegfried was his first name, and later he changed it to Shlomo. Martin to Moeshe(ph) and Herbert to Yitzhak(ph). And I was born on September 28\", 1919. After the war, when there was a great shortage of food, and my father had to work very hard to get milk from peasants near Nuremberg, because you couldn\u2019t get enough for a baby."

            "answer": "My parents always had to rent a place. They did not own an apartment and they always looked for a place to rent near a park, so that it would be easy for the children to go there and play. They were sufficiently well off for my mother to have one or two household helps, because in those days you didn\u2019t have dishwashers, and you couldn\u2019t go to the gr-grocery store and get prepared food, so it was a lot more work to feed four children and a husband. My father was the first in his family to break away from the pattern of being a petty merchant selling a \u2014 running a store to provide clothing and dry goods. He was able to purchase a factory, manufacturing shaving brushes, something we don\u2019t use any more today. And he was married in 1912, shortly after the sinking of the Titanic. And so I still remember in our home, there was a memento to the pi \u2014 Titanic, because that was an event that apparently affected a lot of people. And shortly after he purchased the factory, World War II \u2014 World War I broke out, and he and his brothers \u2014 he had four brothers \u2014 three brothers \u2014 were drafted. And my father served in the German army for four years, and was very upset and resentful over the amount of anti-Semitism he experienced."

So, the German government decided to have a census of how many Jews were serving in the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

When the findings were that the Jews were overrepresented 1n the army, the results were not published, not until the late 20s. But \u2014 so he was drafted as a private and ended his service as a private, as did most Jews. I mean, if you were a physician or a dentist, you might become an officer, but by and large Jews were not considered qualified to be in combat, and so he spent his period of time in the transportation system, which meant looking after horses, because that was the main vehicle transportation. So, I remember these things, I\u2019m sure, not when I was \u2014 before going to primary school. But I had always someone, a \u2014 a caretaker, looking after the smaller children, or taking us to an aunt and uncle\u2019s house, who had a child my age. So this is how I lived in Nuremberg, but I do not recall having any non- Jewish German friends."

But as soon as \u2014 after four years, I went to high school, gymnasium as in \u2014 they call it in German.

Now, of course, I had two older brothers, who were educationally very active, so I would say at age eight and nine, I was very much aware of elections, and the propaganda in elections and the Nazi party, and the Nationalists, who were close to the Nazis.

It was based in \u2014 a lot on export of shaving brushes to other European countries, and he had traveled a great deal to different countries, and as a result I became a stamp collector. But he lost his business because in the depression there just wasn\u2019t enough, so he worked for a company selling their c \u2014 shaving brushes. And he lost the job. And I remember in 19 \u2014 you know, in January and February 1933, when Hitler came into power, that this was pretty bad, but we didn\u2019t think it was a catastrophe. It wouldn\u2019t last, after all, the Nazi party was not a majority, but close to it. And I remember my father, for example, printing advertisements to announce that he was making men\u2019s suits to \u2014 for measure. He hired tailors to do the work, and he would find customers and take their measurements and sell tailor made clothing, which in those days was a very common thing, I mean, you didn\u2019t have the mass production. And so he had advertisements printed, and when I was out of school or had a day off, I would take these ads and put them into mailboxes. My first job. So he, even though there was a Nazi boycott, he continued to try and sell, although gradually the business stopped, because it was dangerous and counterproductive for Germans to do business with any Jew. So, in 1934 -\u201935, he effectively ceased having an income."

I was aware of the Stiirmer newspaper, that came out every week, but the Jewish youth groups to which I belonged, a religious Zionist group called Esba(ph) continued to function. We went on hiking trips and \u2014 and at that time, while I do remember the boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1\u201c, 1933, being surprised how many businesses were Jewish. So this \u2014 a friend walking around the city, I said, good God, these are Jew \u2014 all Jewish, because they were being boycotted, but I wasn\u2019t have a \u2014 didn\u2019t have a sense of fear. And once on a hike, a group of Nazi SS troops told us we had to break up camp and go back home. But again, no sense of fear that anything would happen to me. So, I was spared the frightening experiences of Jews after 1937 - \u201938, when there was a great deal of physical abuse. There were some Jews arrested in \u201933, and a few were killed in concentration camps, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 my family didn\u2019t know any of them, so that I would say \u2014 when I left Germany I never had experienced the sense of physical fear, because that came later."

So, we had problems. So when I went to high school, everything changed. I was a good student, the student \u2014 the teachers liked me. When the teachers ran out of booklets for examinations, he would send me to a store nearby to pick them up. And I remember one time he says, oh you can\u2019t go to this store, because it\u2019s owned by a Jew, you have to go to that store. I didn\u2019t like that, but \u2014 I was well regarded in the school, and one day found out that \u2014 that all \u2014 not only I, but other Jewish children had to leave, and \u2014 well, that\u2019s politics. The Jewish community \u2014 by that time I lived in Berlin, my family had moved to Berlin, and there they had a very good Jewish school, whose teachers, many of them were college professors who had lost their jobs, who later on sometimes became quite famous individually, as scholars in Israel or in the United States. So, I went for one year to a Jewish high school in the suburb of Berlin called Griinewald, from which, by the way, the Jews of Berlin were deported from that place. And so I would say I did not, as I said, I \u2014 I knew what was going on, because I listened to the news, and read the newspapers and talked to friends about what was happening.

But, we talked about it at home, and I think my parents decided, because of the history of all this, that there was no future for us in Germany, as early as 1933.

And so they made it especially difficult for Jews to get papers, unless they had very good connections in the U.S. and Canada. But, under pressure, Roosevelt agreed to commit, I don\u2019t know how many, whether it was 2,000 or 20,000 children from Germany to come to the United States under a guarantee of the Jewish community that they would not become a burden to the welfare system.

He was a salesperson for different companies, but never quite made it in the corporate world, and they had one son, a little younger than I, and \u2014 almost the same age, and that created problems, because he was doing okay in school, but I was academically outstanding. And so I think that created problems for Richard Mindas(ph). I didn\u2019t have any problems with him, but we didn\u2019t become close. And \u2014 but I went first to a New York school, the Jefferson High School in Brooklyn. And there, fortunately, they had a good speech department. So the speech therapist took an interest in me, and helped me to learn to speak English properly. So I got a lot of special instruction, and my capacity to speak English and to spell and so on, developed rather quickly, so that when later on, before I graduated, I actually got better grades in English than most of my fellow students, because I had to learn the language and therefore was more careful with spelling. So actually, I graduated from White Plains High School at the age of 16, because I got credit by taking examinations in world history and European history. I had to learn American history, I had to learn English, but math and geography, I passed the Regents Exams, so that I graduated early and went to college at the age of 16.

And I also got a scholarship for maintenance from \u2014 through the German Jewish Children\u2019s Aid from someone of the Woberg(ph) family. Because one of their daughters who was active in the Zionist movement met me and I was so knowledgeable about what was going on in the Middle East, she decided to get the family to send me to Cornell. And I also met the president of Hadassah, because her son went to a summer camp to which I was invited. So that I had connections, through my knowledge of what was going on in the Jewish world. I did a lot of reading. I had a nephew by marriage of my father, who was a professor at the theological seminary. So I had contacts with the academic world at the age of 15 and 16 and 17 that resulted in my having contacts among the Jewish leadership elite, including Rabbi Pool, whose wife also became president of Hadassah. And at one point I was invited by Justice Brandeis to meet with him in his home here in Washington, because he was interested in cooperative farming and kibbutzim. And by that time I had a job to do research in that field."

But when I got to Cornell and took a course in animal husbandry, I came to the dec \u2014 quickly to the decision that I was not the right person to help cows and horses deliver their offspring. And also, I took a course in rural sociology. And there I wrote a term paper on the kibbutz movement, simply from what you read in the newspapers and knew from my brothers in Israel. And the professor liked the paper so much \u2014 he happened to be the editor of rural sociology, so it got published. So at \u2014 as a junior at Cornell, I was a pub \u2014 I had a publication in a \u2014 in \u20141n a well-known journal, and that made a big difference in my subsequent career.

I mean, like Rabbi Wise, who had good relationship with Roosevelt, and so he had to be very careful in open criticism of the Department of State. I was aware of the American Jewish committee and their ambivalence about being too supportive of the Zionists, because after all, we Jews are religion rather than a nationality, and I was very much identified with the idea that Jews are both a religion and a nationality. And so I would say I had a quite advanced knowledge, not only what was going on in the U.S. or in Germany, or in much of the rest of Europe, what was going on in the Soviet Union. When I was at Cornell, there was a pretty active communist youth group, and I was among the Jewish kids who were very much opposed to the Soviet Union, because of \u2014 even though they seemed to be wi \u2014 quite progressive, they were a dictatorship.

            "answer": "After I graduated from Cornell, I had been advised by a professor who Leonard Katrow(ph), who was very friendly towards me and invited me to his home many times, he advised me not to go into academia, because he said Jews didn\u2019t have much of a chance. And that it would be better off to study the applications of sociology, so I applied to a school of social work at the University of Chicago, which at that time was well regarded, and had a sociological orientation, rather than a psychiatric orientation. And while I was there, I received a phone call from New York, from Edward A. Newman, a wealthy Jewish banker, asking me if I were interested in conducting a study of cooperative farming in the United States, what our experiences were in that field, because the \u2014 Henry Wallace, either secretary of agriculture or vice-president at \u2014 I think he had just stopped being vice-president, Truman had been appointed \u2014 was very interested 1n possibly expanding This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So Edward Newman, who knew Henry Wallace, decided to fund a study. And the reason he called me 1s a term paper of mine on kibbutzim in the junior year had gotten published in a journal. And so, I looked like being an expert in an area where nobody else was really better informed. Not that I really was an expert, because I didn\u2019t speak Hebrew and had never lived in Israel. So I decided to accept the job and after one quarter at the end of December, went to New York to start the job. The study was \u2014 had to have a organizational sponsorship, and so we set up the rules [indecipherable] institute, and with the help of Henry Wallace, I was able to recruit a board of directors, who were very, very prominent. Some of them were suggested by Justice Brandeis, who heard about the study and invited me to his home on a Sunday morning to tell him what was happening in the cooperative farming field, especially Palestine. He obviously continued to have a significant influence and interest, and indeed, had been responsible for the book by Walter C. Loudermilk, the commissioner of social si \u2014 the commissioner of conservation in the department of agriculture, who had made a study of why 1s it that in the Middle East, there is such incredible poverty, when at This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And he went by car from Morocco, all the way to Iraq and Turkey and then wrote a book in which he pointed out that the neglect and the poverty was due to the way the social structure was operating under Islam, and the only bright light was the Jewish settlements in Palestine. And he praised them and pointed out the modern agricultural methods and thi \u2014 the green line already existed in 1940 when \u2014 in \u201941. And when Henry Wallace got the report, he apparently called Brandeis and told him, you should really look at this. And Brandeis got someone, a woman, to edit the report, publish it as a book called, \u201cThe Land of Promise,\u201d and the book was distributed to every member of Congress. And so, the fact that I was making the study was obviously of interest to Brandeis. So suddenly, as a refugee, I felt myself interacting with people in the so \u2014 conservation service, the agricultural extension service, and wherever I went to study cooperative farming experiences in the United States, I had superb cooperation."

So in preparation for the liberation of France, they were going to train a cadre of people to govern France. And even though I didn\u2019t know French, but becu \u2014 my card fell out and they decided I was one of these people, so suddenly I was transferred from Camp Rucker, Alabama to Queens College, New York, to learn how to be one of the military government staff. French economics, French history, French law. The f \u2014 the \u2014 the taxation system and so on, so for six months I learned a great deal about France, and learned enough French so I could go to Columbia and pass my French language exam, because at Columbia you had to have two foreign languages if you wanted a PhD. They accepted my German and I passed the French exam, I learned enough. And we were about ready to be shipped over to England to work with the English, who had reluctantly accepted the policy of Roosevelt, when Roosevelt and Churchill met in Casablanca. And there Churchill convinced Roosevelt that the free French, de Gaulle should govern the occupied France, that with all the problems that de Gaulle might create, it was better than the English and Americans tr \u2014 doing the job. So overnight, about 10,000 bright American soldiers became surplus, and had to be reassigned, and our \u2014 overnight, our program was finished.

And most of the trainees were reassigned to different divisions. Many military units had a shortage of people with high IQs. And this was an opportunity for the army to infuse more people with high IQs. But a few were given a choice, because the army was trying to fill some special jobs. And one of them was a unit that would be dropped to sabotage German facilities, dropped over Germany. And so I was interviewed and told that that was an opportunity for me, but they warned me that the chances of surviving were less than 50 percent, and what would be involved. And not that I was particularly heroic and wanting such a \u2014 a job, but I didn\u2019t feel as a Jew I could say no, so I \u2014 I said yes, when I really wa \u2014 wished I didn\u2019t have to say yes. So, as a result, I was sent to Camp Ritchie, the U.S. intelligence training area near Washington, D.C."

You will be sent in a prison camp. You will get three meals a day, identical to the food of the American or British soldiers, which includes; real coffee three times a day; real cigarettes with every meal; meat and fish. Healthy food, the way allied soldiers are being fed. You will be allowed through the Red Cross to communicate with your families, so that if you surrender, you will have contact with your families, which now, very often you don\u2019t have, because the German communication system was not very good in \u201944 and \u201945. That was the surrender. And these guarantee, they called it guarantee [indecipherable]. Quite a few soldiers, when they surrendered, pulled them out of their shoes, or somewhere in their clothing, to be sure that they would be treated properly. And certainly when we interviewed prisoners of war, we did not use the kind of threats or you know, s \u2014 intimidation f-for I think many good reasons. First of all, tactical information you don\u2019t get from soldiers. You can sometimes get it from officers, but by the time you get it, all a \u2014 it often is no longer valuable. Because what do we want to know is where do you have your artillery, what kind of weapons do you have, does your unit This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

What plans were made to proceed to defeat us, and so on. That kind of tactical information, for 24 - 20 - 48 hours might be useful, but with advances of the battlefield, it does \u2014 it doesn\u2019t become very meaningful. So at any rate, while \u2014 when you interviewed officers, you would try to learn from them what kind of equipment they had. You didn\u2019t just f\u2014 you didn\u2019t focus on that, you also spent a lot of time on their schooling, how they became officers, what their career was, and were they being treated fairly. What about their families, how they were doing, their children and so on. And f \u2014 on that basis, people often told us things, how life was terrible, what they were fearful of being arrested simply because they wanted to survive, and that they had been dis \u2014 badly treated, and that in particular officer in their command had been very mean and they had suffered this and that and so on.

And when I ask about interesting prisoners, he said, well ba \u2014 you better talk to \u2014 I have the name now, but I don\u2019t remember just now what the name is. So I came to his office and he said, oh yes, there\u2019s a general who would like to surrender, but he\u2019s afraid of being taken prisoner by some enlisted group, because they might mistreat him. He would like to be \u2014 he\u2019s hiding, hoping to get arrested by officers, and I know where he 1s and he told me that\u2019s what he would like to do, and if you are interested, I will tell you where he 1s. That was kind of a silly, you know \u2014 but I got the instructions and so on, and talked more. He didn\u2019t know much about the general himself. My driver, who was married, felt this was a trick to get us into the woods above Treya(ph) where there might still be German soldiers that had been roaming around and would attack us, and this is not a reliable story. But I had become convinced that it was real, at least there\u2019s a good chance, and so I said, let\u2019s go and get him and he had \u2014 my driver had no choice, I \u2014 I happened to b-be one grade above him.

And so my driver was suspicious, he didn\u2019t go in, and I went into the house and we sat down. But the small room was crowded with furniture covered with bed sheets. And we sat down on a couch and started to talk. He pulled out documents signed by the chief \u2014 the commander of the German army, General Keitel, informing him that the fuehrer had decided that the army needed more young people; they weren\u2019t sufficiently aggressive to push ahead, and for that reason, in spite of his good service, he was being retired. He appealed the forced retirement, but the appeal was denied. All of this was in correspondence signed by no one less than the counterpart This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, I took those documents and he said he decided, even though he was no longer a soldier, he said, I\u2019m a civilian now, but he decided that as a former general, he might be considered someone to be made a prisoner of war, he hoped this would not be the case, but this is why he let the message be transmitted that he was ready to be in touch with the enemy. He indicated in conversations about the war, I learned \u2014 he and I talked about his career. So, he said, I became a soldier before World War I, and served in the Austrian army, and he told me the different battles. And then stayed in the Austrian army and then when Germany occupied Austria, he became part of the German army. And he was involved in the war against Russia and was in-injured near Stalingrad, and for a year and a half was in the hospital. And after he had recuperated, the army assigned him to be the governor of the French city of Metz. And he showed me documents there, his appointment. And he indicated that he had problems with the head of the Nazi party in Metz. Metz is a French city, occupied mostly by German speaking people, so it\u2019s part of Alsace-Lorraine that had been transferred after World War I, to France. And he said, I had problems with the local Nazi leader. When I got the job, they offered me several villas, but they were all taken from Jews. And my wife and I didn\u2019t want to live in a house that was full of tears, so we didn\u2019t take them, we went into an apartment.

And then I was in \u2014 had trouble with the Nazi party leader, because I took the position that for security purposes, we had to choo \u2014 treat the local population well. So I went to French music events, French theater, not only the German theater, and the Nazi leader felt that was not a proper thing to do, for the commanding general to go to a French theater production. And he complained to Himmler and asked that he be dismissed, and apparently succeeded; Himmler supported his retirement. All of this was in documents. So, I se \u2014 I then ask him, well, what you \u2014 what would you recommend that Germany do today? He said, we\u2019ve lost the war, we have to accept unconditional surrender, because every day major German villages and cities are devastated, and we are not gaining anything. It\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019ve lost. So I said, would you be willing to tell this to the German population if you had a chance? He says, of course. And then I told him that he was a lucky man, that he had the opportunity to do this right now, because there was a broadcasting station in my truck. So he got caught, and I gave him a pen and paper, and I found he had great difficulty writing a script, so I offered to write it, help him draft it. Well, what are you going to say\u201d? He said okay, and I drafted a speech, thinking in terms of what is he likely to say? So, you know, he wasn\u2019t advocating to surrender, because Germany had done terrible things. He \u2014 he had no regrets about moving into Russia and whatever he-helped in Russia, and you know, every This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He simply was willing to surrender because it was better for Germany. So he modified my remarks, his German was much better than mine. And then I said let\u2019s \u2014 I sat him into the truck doing exactly what you are doing, and we listened to the broadcast. And then I had him do it two more times, because it didn\u2019t sound as good as I thought it wou \u2014 should be. And afterwards I told him that he should put on his uniform, and asked him if he had any weapons, and the only thing he had was a sword and a pistol, and I took both of those. And he dressed in his army uniform and I said, well, I have to take you to headquarters to \u2014 for them to decide whether you are to become a prisoner of war, or a civilian and could be treated as a civilian. And so he gave me more papers to document his status. And put him into a truck late at night, the front seat, I sat in the back because again, I didn\u2019t trust him to sit in back of me, and drove to Luxembourg. We got there about four o\u2019clock in the morning and I called my commanding officer in his quarters and told him that I got a general. And Harber(ph), who had a good sense of humor says, Eaton, why don\u2019t you drive more carefully? And after telling him a little bit more about the general, I said, well, why don\u2019t we h-have breakfast with him, because I think everybody else here would like to meet him. The Americans had not captured a general up to now on the western front like the Russians side. And there was a \u2014 well, you n \u2014 as you know, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, at about five o\u2019clock, we \u2014 the cook had prepared good breakfast, bacon and eggs and trimmings, and the colonel and majors and captains were all assembled. There was one thing that I forgot to tell you, I had been told that the general was terribly worried about being taken prisoner by enlisted men, he thought he would be mistreated. So I decided I would make myself an officer. That was a risky thing to do, to impersonate an officer in the army. But you know, we had a great deal of freedom in my cir \u2014 in other words, there was nobody telling me what to do when I went to the front lines. It was my decision to decide where, which camp to go to, whom to interview, which American officers to ask for cooperation. So, before going up in the hills, early in the morning, about eight or 8:30, I asked Germans where there was a drugstore, and I went to the drugstore, which wasn\u2019t open yet, rang the bell. The druggist answered when he saw, I guess, the military truck outside and looked worried, of course. And I said, I need a Band- Aid. Well, that was an easy request. So he immediately got a box of Band-Aids. And ask him for a scissors and I cut two pieces of the rubberized part of the Band- Aid, which is white on the other side, and put it on the helmet and promoted myself to captain. And so, when I took the general into, you know, custody, I introduced myself as Captain Eaton, who had been sent by supreme headquarters to accept his This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, you know, he felt sort of pleased that somehow supreme headquarters \u2014 and that may have had a fact \u2014 an impact on his re-readiness to cooperate. So I had told Harbie(ph) on the phone what I had done. And when I arrived everybody treated me as Captain Eaton, and \u2014 and my driver was sort of amazed that I \u2014 nobody criticized me, and then afterwards a decision was made to clear with supreme headquarters what to do with the general, that we would use him to work for us at Radio Luxembourg, and in the \u2014 the day or two that this might take, we put up the general in the hotel, and my job, I was in the same room with him, was to take him for walks, see to it that he got his rations, and talk to him. And then introduce him, bring him to different officers who wanted to talk to him, for whatever information they were interested in. And after da \u2014 a day or two, nothing happened. So I was able to talk to Captain Harber(ph), he said well, we are having problems with this man, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but it doesn\u2019t look good, because some of the senior officials in Eisenhower\u2019s headquarters are concerned over the fact that you took this general in Third Army territory and brought him to Luxembourg, when according to army rules, which you didn\u2019t know and I didn\u2019t know, you f \u2014 all prisoners of war have to be cleared through the prison camps.

And \u2014 and that happened within \u2014 on the first day. So I went to the Jewish barrack and introduced myself, and we sat down, I said, what are the problems? Are you getting enough food? And they said, well, we\u2019re getting our share. And \u2014 but they were complaining about the administrative problems they had of getting recognized as a nationality. So we discussed the political aspects, pointed out to them that the British government had a strong, vested interest in preventing the establishment of Jews as a Separate nationality, because of what was th \u2014 their commitment in Palestine, that they had made a decision that they made a mistake in 1917, there were many more Arabs than Jews, and they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t want to lose support of the Muslims, and so they had made an agreement, and until that can be overturned, the British were pushing very hard to oppose recognition of Jews. But on the other hand, Jews shouldn\u2019t be worried, and simply, they had the power to refuse. They should insist on whatever they want, because there was strong political support of their position in the American Jewish community, and to some extent in the British community. So they had done the right thing and they should be very assertive and so on. So we talked about that, basically was mos \u2014 much of the time. In addition to getting information for my reports, that was the focus of my visit. After all, I only spent maybe four or five hours in the camp. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And it was on my page, and then Harber(ph) decided that was a good story, so that became \u2014 was reprinted in all the other newspapers. So some of the stories I wrote were copied, and I came to the conclusion that the German governor of Bavaria was not too sympathetic towards Jews, because he urged that the policy that had been adopted that Jews This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I talked to them, and they says, we have no choice, she did it, and we have to prosecute. So I wrote up a defense and there was a trial, so this was public.

And the whole uncertainty of what would happen to all these displaced persons, the ba \u2014 of course, after my newspaper was over, and I no longer had a position, I \u2014 I was offered a job in military government in Germany by the U.S. Army, with a pro \u2014 with a promotion to captain. But I didn\u2019t want to live among Germans, and I wanted to finish my academic career, so \u2014 and I didn\u2019t really like the American policy in general, which was to work very closely with the lower level German officials, which I didn\u2019t particularly like, although today I realize that if we had done what we did in Iraq, of dismissing the infrastructure of Saddam Hussein, we really didn\u2019t have the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And so we really didn\u2019t have much of a choice, except to use a great many officials in the same positions that they had occupied under the Nazis, as long as they had not been excessively active, and known to have been \u2014 have \u2014 have en-engaged in atrocities. So major anti-Semites, judges who convicted too many people to death for stealing food, or for racial fo \u2014 fo \u2014 disapproved sexual relations or things like that, they lost their job. But most judges, most Nazi judges stayed as Nazi judges. And so by the time I could have become maybe the governor of this or that city in Germany, I would have had to deal with these kinds of officials, so no, I wanted to finish my PhD. So that \u2014 the \u2014 but certainly the \u2014 one other thing is, once I started to go back 1 \u2014 go into teaching, my focus was on my professional career. So I had research ideas, and I got adequate funding for research. So I focused on research, I didn\u2019t return to my army days or take a look at my extensive files of what happened in World War II. I didn\u2019t think of myself of somebody who was a historian of Germany, World War II. I had lots of interesting records of things I did, and they were put in boxes, and these boxes got transported from this home to that home, and I was always too busy to really look at them, of what was in there, because I had many other interesting professional challenges, until after my retirement, I started looking at the material. And I\u2019m now engaged in writing a history of how my family interacted with the German culture over many This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Yes. The \u2014I mean, for hundreds of years, on both sides of my family, they remained Orthodox, even though a large proportion of the German Jews became Reform Jews. On my father\u2019s side they were quite conservative. On my mother\u2019s side, they took advantage of modern secular education, but they remained Orthodox. I had relatives as far back as 1835 who went to Palestine, because they wanted to live there. I\u2014 on my mother\u2019s side, I had people going to Palestine, 1882. The \u2014 so that my family was clearly Orthodox. Two of my brothers remained Orthodox. My oldest brother and I, especially under the influence of the Holocaust, I became convinced there is no superior po-power looking after exactly what\u2019s happening to any of us. And that if there is some rational power that explains the incredible complexity, and the \u2014 the uniformity of many things in nature; the fact that we have DNA that we shor \u2014 share with earthworms and with butterflies.

So, I\u2014 I am not an Orthodox Jew today. And \u2014 but I am identified with the Jewish community for ethnic reasons. So from that point of view, I had an opportunity to do things during those unusual periods of time, which the only other time I was able to express my interest in being Jewish is when I took a job for five years to establish a school of social work in Haifa University, and they needed an outside person who was not involved in Israeli politics. And so they brought me in because university wanted to establish a school that would compete with Hebrew University and have a different ideology, so I took that job."
