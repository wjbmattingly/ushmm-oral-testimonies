Dr. Eaton , can you start by giving your first name as it appeared or iginally, as you were named in Germany, your name in Germany and why don\u2122t you give us the names of your immediate family as well?",
            "answer": "All right. I was born as Joseph Wexler in Nuremberg, Germany in \u0152 not in a hospital, because it wasn\u2122t safe to go to hospital, if you could afford to have delivery at home. So I was born in Luxfeld(ph) three, across the park. My father was Jacob Wexler , and my mother Flora Goldschmidt Wexler . And I have three brothers, Siegfried was his first name, and later he changed it to Shlomo . Martin to Moeshe(ph) and Herbert to Yitzhak(ph). And I was born on September 28 th, 1919. After the war, when there was a great shortage of food, and my father had to work very hard to get milk from peasants near Nuremberg, because you couldn\u2122t get enough for a baby."

            "answer": "My parents always had to rent a place. They did not own an apartment and they always looked for a place to rent near a park, so that it would be easy for the children to go there and play. They were sufficiently well off for my mother to have one or two household helps, because in those days you didn\u2122t have dishwashers, and you couldn\u2122t go to the gr-grocery store a nd get prepared food, so it was a lot more work to feed four children and a husband. My father was the first in his family to break away from the pattern of being a petty merchant selling a \u0152 running a store to provide clothing and dry goods. He was able to purchase a factory, manufacturing shaving brushes, something we don\u2122t use any more toda y. And he was married in 1912, shortly after the sinking of the Titanic. And so I still remember in our home, there was a memento to the pi \u0152 Titanic , because that was an event that apparently affected a lot of people. And shortly afte r he purchased the factory, World War II \u0152 World War I broke out, and he and his brot hers \u0152 he had four brothers \u0152 three brothers \u0152 were drafted. And my father se rved in the German army for four years, and was very upset and resentful over the amount of anti-Semitism he experienced."

            "question": "Can you describe what sort of anti-Semitism he noticed?",
            "answer": "Well \u0152 well, what I do remember, his telling me about the complaint that too many Jews were trying to get out of serving in the army. So, the German government decided to have a census of how many Jews were serving in the Interview with Joseph Eaton May 27, 2010 5German army. When the findings were that the Jews were overrepresented in the army, the results were not published, not until the late 20s. But \u0152 so he was drafted as a private and ended his service as a private, as did most Jews. I mean, if you were a physician or a dentist, you might become an officer, but by and large Jews were not considered qualified to be in combat, and so he spent his period of time in the transportation system, which meant looking after horses, because that was the main vehicle transportation. So, I remember th ese things, I\u2122m sure, not when I was \u0152 before going to primary school. But I ha d always someone, a \u0152 a caretaker, looking after the smaller children, or taking us to an aunt and uncle\u2122s house, who had a child my age. So this is how I lived in Nuremberg, but I do not recall having any nonJewish German friends."

We lived there, nearby, walking distance, and I do remember being attacked sometimes by other kids, ger \u0152 who didn\u2122t like Jewish kids, and you had to fight. And so I went to this school, which was not a very good school; we had, I would say, very poor teachers. And I was kind of a rebellious, problematic child. I would talk back to the Interview with Joseph Eaton May 27, 2010 6teachers sometimes. And at one point, a te acher called me a donkey. And so I said, well if I am a donkey, you are a monkey. And the teacher was so upset. And finally my parents bribed me to apologize, even though I \u0152 they agreed I \u0152 it was justified for me to talk back. But as soon as \u0152 af ter four years, I went to high school, gymnasium as in \u0152 they call it in German.

Now, of course , I had two older brothers, who were educationally very active, so I would say at age eight and nine, I was very much aware of elections, and the propaganda in elections and the Nazi party, and the Nationalists, who were close to the Nazis.

            "answer": "Well, my father at that point lost his job, because the company for which he w \u0152 he had to give up his business because of the depression. It was based in \u0152 a lot on export of shaving brushes to other European countries, and he had traveled a great deal to different countries, and as a result I became a stamp collector. But he lost his business because in the depression there just wasn\u2122t enough, so he worked for a company selling their c \u0152 shaving brushes. A nd he lost the job. And I remember in 19 \u0152 you know, in January and February 1933, when Hitler came into power, that this was pretty bad, but we didn\u2122t think it was a catastrophe. It wouldn\u2122t last, after all, the Nazi party was not a majority, but close to it. And I remember my father, for example, printing advertisements to ann ounce that he was making men\u2122s suits to \u0152 for measure. He hired tailors to do the work, and he would find customers and take their measurements and sell tailor made cl othing, which in those days was a very common thing, I mean, you didn\u2122t have the mass production. And so he had advertisements printed, and when I was out of school or had a day off, I would take these ads and put them into mailboxes. My first job. So he, even though there was a Nazi boycott, he continued to try and sell, although gradually the business stopped, because it was dangerous and counterproductive for Germans to do business with any Jew. So, in 1934 -\u212235, he eff ectively ceased having an income."

I was aware of the St\u00fcrmer newspaper, that came out every week, but the Jewish youth groups to which I belonged, a religious Zionist group called Esba(ph) continued to function. We went on hiking trips and \u0152 and at that time, while I do remember the boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1st, 1933, being surprised how many businesses were Jewish. So this \u0152 a friend walking around the city, I said, good God, these are Jew \u0152 all Jewish, because they were being boycotted, but I wasn\u2122t have a \u0152 didn\u2122t have a sense of fear. And once on a hike, a group of Nazi SS troops told us we had to break up camp and go back home. But again, no sense of fear that anything would happen to me. So, I was spared the frightening experiences of Je ws after 1937 - \u212238, when there was a great deal of physical abuse. There were some Jews arrested in \u212233, and a few were killed in concentration camps, but I didn\u2122t \u0152 my fami ly didn\u2122t know any of them, so that I would say \u0152 when I left Germany I never had experienced the sense of physical fear, because that came later."

                " Well, that is interesting. In high school, there was a complete shift, because since I \u0152 I was a fairly good student, very go od student in fact, but had very bad Interview with Joseph Eaton May 27, 2010 9relationships with the teachers, who found that I asked too ma ny questions and you know, there were all kinds of religious instruction and I wasn\u2122t quite sure, and asked questions. So, we had problems. So when I went to high school, everything changed. I was a good student, the student \u0152 the teachers liked me. When the teachers ran out of booklets for examinations, he would send me to a store nearby to pick them up. And I remember one time he says, oh you can\u2122t go to this store, because it\u2122s owned by a Jew, you have to go to that store. I didn\u2122t like that, but \u0152 I was well regarded in the school, and one da y found out that \u0152 that all \u0152 not only I, but other Jewish children had to leave, and \u0152 well, that\u2122s politics. The Jewish community \u0152 by that time I lived in Berlin, my family had moved to Berlin, and there they had a very good Jewish school, whose teachers, many of them were college professors who had lost their j obs, who later on sometimes became quite famous individually, as scholars in Israel or in the United States . So, I went for one year to a Jewish high school in the suburb of Berlin called Gr\u00fcnewald, from which, by the way, the Jews of Berlin were deported from that place. And so I would say I did not, as I said, I \u0152 I kne w what was going on, be cause I listened to the news, and read the newspapers and talk ed to friends about what was happening. Q2: Can I just interject a question? Nuremberg had the odious dis tinction of having Julius Streicher as the gauleiter, the Nazi leader of \u0152 of Franconia, and also the Interview with Joseph Eaton May 27, 2010 10publisher of \ufb01Der St\u00fcrmer,\ufb02 and I was just wondering, you know, about how visible was \ufb01Der St\u00fcrmer \ufb02 \u0152 ",

He was interested in things, but really did not share her intellectual interests. And so the marriage was not a good marriage, but I didn\u2122t know about that. My older brothers did, and they did divorce and emigrated to Holland separately. And my father found another girlfriend and they emigrated together, also to Amsterdam. So it was a congenial divorce. There wasn\u2122t much to argue about in 1936, although emotionally this was a very difficult thing for my mother. But she got a good deal of support from her family and her sisters. So \u0152 howeve r, there was a tremendous amount of correspondence between members of the family.

So at \u0152 as a junior at Cornell , I was a pub \u0152 I had a publication in a \u0152 in \u0152 in a well-known journal, and that made a big difference in my subsequent career. And that\u2122s how Justice Brandeis heard about me and whose interest in Palestine and its economic development was a private, but very great interest. And so I think, through Mrs. Epstein, somehow he heard about me and he invited me to come to see him on a Sunday morning."

I mean, like Rabbi Wise , who had good relationship with Roosevelt , and so he had to be very careful in open criticism of the Department of State. I was aware of the American Jewish committee and their ambivalence about being too supportive of the Zionists, because after all, we Jews are religion rather than a nationality, and I was very much identified with the idea that Jews are both a religion and a nationality. And so I would say I had a quite advanced knowledge, not only what was going on in the U.S. or in Germany, or in much of the rest of Europe , what was going on in the Soviet Union. When I was at Cornell , there was a pretty active communist youth group, and I was among the Jewish kids who were very much opposed to the Soviet Union , because of \u0152 even though they seemed to be wi \u0152 quite progressive, th ey were a dictatorship.

It\u2122s a continuation of the interview begun at the Holocaust Museum in June. Okay, when we left off with the previous in terview, you had finished telling us about your experiences at Cornell and were just beginning your graduate school and about to ente r the army. So let\u2122s start with after you left Cornell and began graduate school in Chicago .",
            "answer": "After I graduated from Cornell , I had been advised by a professor who Leonard Katrow (ph), who was very friendly towards me and invited me to his home many times, he advised me not to go into academia, because he said Jews didn\u2122t have much of a chance. And that it would be better off to study the applications of sociology, so I applied to a school of social work at the University of Chicago , which at that time was well regarded, and had a sociological orientation, rather than a psychiatric orientation. And while I was there, I received a phone call from New York, from Edward A. Newman , a wealthy Jewish banke r, asking me if I were interested in conducting a study of cooperative farming in the United States, what our experiences were in that field, because the \u0152 Henry Wallace, either secretary of agriculture or vice-president at \u0152 I think he had just stopped being vice-president, Truman had been appointed \u0152 was very interested in possibly expanding Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 24cooperative farming in the United States as a way of helping landless farm workers to become owners, and they were particul arly interested in moshavim, because one of the sons of Henry Wallace had been in Israel for a summer, and reported about kibbutzim and moshavim. So Edward Newman , who knew Henry Wallace, decided to fund a study. And the reason he called me is a term paper of mine on kibbutzim in the junior year had gotten pub lished in a journal. And so, I looked like being an expert in an area where nobody else was really better informed. Not that I really was an expert, because I didn\u2122t speak Hebrew and had never lived in Israel. So I decided to accept the job and after one quarter at the end of December, went to New York to start the job. The study was \u0152 had to have a organizational sponsorship, and so we set up the rules [indecipherable] institute, and with the help of Henry Wallace, I was able to recruit a board of directors, who were very, very prominent. Some of them were suggested by Justice Brandeis, who heard about the study and invited me to his home on a Sunday morning to tell him what was happening in the cooperative farming field, especially Palestine. He obviously continued to have a significant influen ce and interest, and indeed, had been responsible for the book by Walter C. Loudermilk, the commissioner of social si \u0152 the commissioner of conservation in the de partment of agriculture, who had made a study of why is it that in the Middle East , there is such incredible poverty, when at Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 25one time in their history, it was the most advanced and prospe rous area? And he went by car from Morocco, all the way to Iraq and Turkey and then wrote a book in which he pointed out that the neglect and the poverty was due to the way the social structure was operating under Islam, and the only bright light was the Jewish settlements in Palestine. And he praised them and pointed out the modern agricultural methods and thi \u0152 the green line already existed in 1940 when \u0152 in \u212241. And when Henry Wallace got the report, he apparently called Brandeis and told him, you should really look at this. And Brandeis got someone, a woman, to edit the report, publish it as a book called, \ufb01The Land of Promise ,\ufb02 and the book was distributed to every member of Congress. And so, the fact that I was making the study was obviously of interest to Brandeis. So suddenly, as a refugee, I felt myself interacting with people in the so \u0152 conservation service, the agricultural extension service, and wherever I went to study cooperative farming experiences in the United States, I had superb cooperation."

But one of the special problems we faced is that our parents were living in Amsterdam , and if we were taken prisoner, this might \u0152 we were worried that this could cause problems for them as parents of traitors, because we were obviously fighting against the Fatherland. So we decided to change our name and adopted a name that was suggested by Rabbi de Sola Pool , and \u0152 whom \u0152 whom I knew, because his wife was president of Hadassah.

So, at any rate, this is how, professionally, I finished a book which Columbia University accepted as my dissertation.

And in 1942, or was it f \u0152 or early \u212243, I\u2122m not sure exactly, the U.S. government had decided that when we liberate France, the U.S. would need to govern France . Roosevelt did not trust de Gaulle, whom he regarded as an extreme nationalist who would undermine the recovery of Europe, as happened in wor \u0152 after World War I, when the French were \u0152 insisted on the Versailles treaty. So, he decided he wasn\u2122t going to let the Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 32free French govern France , but there would be a U.S. military government of France, then there would be free election, and let the French decide whether they want de Gaulle or somebody else. So in pr eparation for the liberation of France, they were going to train a cadre of people to govern France . And even though I didn\u2122t know French, but becu \u0152 my card fell out and they decided I was one of these people, so suddenly I was transferred from Camp Rucker, Alabama to Queens College, New York , to learn how to be one of the military governmen t staff. French economics, French history, French law. The f \u0152 the \u0152 the taxation system and so on, so for six months I learned a great deal about France, and learned enough French so I could go to Columbia and pass my French language exam, because at Columbia you had to have two forei gn languages if you wanted a PhD. They accepted my German and I passed the French exam, I le arned enough. And we were about ready to be shipped over to England to work with the English, who had reluctantly accepted the policy of Roosevelt, when Roosevelt and Churchill met in Casablanca . And there Churchill convinced Roosevelt that the free French, de Gaulle should govern the occupied France , that with all the problems that de Gaulle might create, it was better than the English and Americans tr \u0152 doing the job. So overnight, about 10,000 bright Am erican soldiers became surplus, and had to be reassigned, and our \u0152 overnight, ou r program was finished. I mean, you know, Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 33when you come to think of it, right in the middle of it, there was no longer any need to train people to govern French towns and villages. And most of the trainees were reassigned to different divisions. Many military units had a shortage of people with high IQs. And this was an opportunity for the army to infuse more people with high IQs. But a few were given a choice, because the army was trying to fill some special jobs. And one of them was a unit that would be dropped to sabotage German facilities, dropped over Germany. And so I was interviewed and told that that was an opportunity for me, but they warned me that the chances of surviving were less than 50 percent, and what would be involve d. And not that I was particularly heroic and wanting such a \u0152 a job, but I didn\u2122t feel as a Jew I could say no, so I \u0152 I said yes, when I really wa \u0152 wished I didn\u2122t have to say yes.

The British had decided before Dunkirk, that the only way they could win in Europe is to adopt a policy of always telling the truth. So at Dunkirk they reported their defeat, the problems of evacuating everybody, the losses, and they broadcast these facts to the Germans over BBC, and the French and so on.

And the other thing we did do, is to encourage listenership. We not only provided accurate information to the Germans, of exactly what was happening, we provided them with information of what was happening to bombed cities and v illages, to the extent that we could get information. And about th ree months before Christmas, 1944, Harbie(ph) convened a meeting of his 10 sold iers and said, you know, we have a problem what to do on Christmas.

You will be sent in a prison camp. You will get three meals a day, identical to the food of the American or British soldiers, which includes; real coffee three times a day; real cigarettes with every meal; meat and fish. Healthy food, the way allied soldiers are being fed. You will be allowed through the Red Cross to communicate with your families, so that if you surrender, you will have contact with your families, which now, very often you don\u2122t have, because the German communication system was not very good in \u212244 and \u212245. That was the surrender. And these guarantee , they called it guarantee [indecipherable] . Quite a few soldiers, when they surrendered, pulled them out of their shoes, or somewhere in their clothing, to be sure that they would be treated properly. And certainly when we interviewed prisoners of war, we did not use the kind of threats or you know, s \u0152 intimidation f-for I think many good reasons. First of all, tactical information you don\u2122t get from soldiers. You can sometimes get it from officers, but by the time you get it, all a \u0152 it often is no longer valuable. Because what do we want to know is where do you have your artillery, what kind of weapons do you have, does your unit Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 49have? What plans were made to proceed to defeat us, and so on. That kind of tactical information, for 24 - 20 - 48 hours might be useful , but with advances of the battlefield, it does \u0152 it doesn\u2122t become very meaningful. So at any rate, while \u0152 when you interviewed officers, you would try to learn from them what kind of equipment they had. You didn\u2122t just f \u0152 you didn\u2122t focus on that, you also spent a lot of time on their schooling, how they beca me officers, what their career was, and were they being treated fairly. What about their families, how they were doing, their children and so on. And f \u0152 on that basis, people often told us things, how life was terrible, what they were fearful of being arrested simply because they wanted to survive, and that they had been dis \u0152 badly treated, and th at in particular officer in their command had been very mean and they had suffered this and that and so on.

And see if there were a ny interesting prisoners. So when I got to Treya(ph), the captain who \u0152 in charge of military government, been maybe there 24 hours and 48 hours, and had found a German who was willing to be a coordinator between the military govern ment and the German administrative Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 51system. And he had apparently not been a Nazi, so the captain had developed trust. And when I ask about interesting prisoners, he said, well ba \u0152 you better talk to \u0152 I have the name now, but I don\u2122t remember just now what the name is. So I came to his office and he said, oh yes, there\u2122s a general who would like to surrender, but he\u2122s afraid of being taken prisoner by some enlisted gr oup, because they might mistreat him. He would like to be \u0152 he\u2122s hi ding, hoping to get arrested by officers, and I know where he is and he told me that \u2122s what he would like to do, and if you are interested, I will tell you where he is. That was kind of a silly, you know \u0152 but I got the instructions and so on, and talked more. He didn\u2122t know much about the general himself. My driver, who was married, felt this was a trick to get us into the woods above Treya(ph) where there might still be German soldiers that had been roaming around and would attack us, and th is is not a reliable story. But I had become convinced that it was real, at least there\u2122s a good chance, and so I said, let\u2122s go and get him and he had \u0152 my driver had no choice, I \u0152 I happened to b-be one grade above him. So, we went with our regular broadcasting truck, and followed directions and drove up into the woods a nd after about maybe half an hour, I saw a man walking with a \u0152 a dog and von Poten had been described to me of having a dog.

            "question": "Okay, this begins the next track with the interview with Joseph Eaton.",
            "answer": "Well, a man who looked like the general that was described, and the fact that he was walking with a dog, we stopped the truck. And I opened the window and said, General von Poten? He looked up and said, jawohl? Sort of, yes. And I said, I understand you want to surrende r? He said yes. I said, well, I was sent by supreme headquarters to take your surrender. Thank you, he said, I\u2122m glad how \u0152 that you got the message. And here is, about 200 mete rs from here is a cottage in which we have been living since I wa s fired from my post a month ago, or two months ago. So please, let\u2122s sit down comfortably in my house. So he walked and we drove and he went into the house and brought out his wife and introduced her. And so my driver was suspicious, he didn\u2122t go in, and I went into the house and we sat down. But the small room was crowded with furniture covered with bed sheets. And we sat down on a couch and started to talk. He pulled out documents signed by the chief \u0152 the commander of th e German army, General Keitel , informing him that the fuehrer had decided that the army need ed more young people; they weren\u2122t sufficiently aggressive to push ahead, and for that reason, in spite of his good service, he was being retired. He appealed the forced retirement, but the appeal was denied. All of this was in correspondence signed by no one less than the counterpart Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 53of Eisenhower, the chief commander of the German army. So, I took those documents and he said he decided, even though he was no longer a soldier, he said, I\u2122m a civilian now, but he decided that as a former general, he might be considered someone to be made a prisoner of war, he ho ped this would not be the case, but this is why he let the message be transmitted that he was ready to be in touch with the enemy. He indicated in conversations about the war, I learned \u0152 he and I talked about his career. So, he said, I became a soldier before World War I, and served in the Austrian army, and he told me the different battles. And then stayed in the Austrian army and then when Germany occupied Austria, he became part of the German army. And he was involved in the war against Russia and was in-injured near Stalingrad, and for a year and a half was in the hospital. And after he had recuperated, the army assigned him to be the governor of the French city of Metz. And he showed me documents there, his a ppointment. And he indicated that he had problems with the head of the Nazi party in Metz. Metz is a French city, occupied mostly by German speaking people, so it\u2122s part of Alsace-Lorraine that had been transferred after World War I, to France. And he said, I had problems with the local Nazi leader. When I got the job, they offered me several villas, but they were all taken from Jews. And my wife and I didn\u2122t want to live in a house that was full of tears, so we didn\u2122t take them, we went into an apartment. He may have realized that Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 54I was Jewish, but he didn\u2122t ask me. And then I was in \u0152 had trouble with the Nazi party leader, because I took the position that for security purposes, we had to choo \u0152 treat the local population well. So I went to French music events, French theater, not only the German theater, and the Nazi leader felt that was not a proper thing to do, for the commanding general to go to a French theater production. And he complained to Himmler and asked that he be dismisse d, and apparently succeeded; Himmler supported his retirement. All of this was in documents. So, I se \u0152 I then ask him, well, what you \u0152 wh at would you recommend that Germany do today? He said, we\u2122ve lost the war, we have to accept unconditional surrender, because every day major German villages and cities are devastated, and we are not gaining anything. It\u2122s \u0152 we\u2122ve lost. So I said, would you be willing to tell this to the German population if you had a chance? He says, of course. And then I told him that he was a lucky man, that he had the opportunity to do this right now, because there was a broadcasting station in my tr uck. So he got caught, and I gave him a pen and paper, and I found he had great difficulty writing a sc ript, so I offered to write it, help him draft it. Well, what are you going to say? He said okay, and I drafted a speech, thinking in terms of what is he likely to say? So, you know, he wasn\u2122t advocating to surrender, because Germany had done terrible things. He \u0152 he had no regrets about moving into Russia and whatever he-helped in Russia, and you know, every Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 55command was one that he tried to execute. He simply was willing to surrender because it was better for Germany. So he modified my remarks, his German was much better than mine. And then I said let\u2122s \u0152 I sat him into the truck doing exactly what you are doing, and we listened to the broadcast. And then I had him do it two more times, because it didn\u2122t sound as good as I thought it wou \u0152 should be. And afterwards I told him that he should put on his uniform, and asked him if he had any weapons, and the only thing he had was a sword and a pistol, and I took both of those. And he dressed in his army uniform and I said, well, I have to take you to headquarters to \u0152 for them to decide whet her you are to become a prisoner of war, or a civilian and could be treated as a civilian. And so he gave me more papers to document his status. And put him into a truck la te at night, the front seat, I sat in the back because again, I didn\u2122t trust him to sit in back of me, and drove to Luxembourg. We got there about four o\u2122clock in the morning and I called my commanding officer in his quarters and told him that I got a general. And Harber(ph), who had a good se nse of humor says, Eaton, why don\u2122t you drive more carefully? And after telling him a little bit more about the general, I said, well, why don\u2122t we h-have breakfast with him, because I think everybody else here would like to meet him. The Americans had not captured a general up to now on the western front like the Russians side. And there was a \u0152 well, you n \u0152 as you know, Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 56in Stalingrad a Russian general who actually then organized troops to fight with the Russians against Hitler. So, at about five o\u2122clock, we \u0152 the cook had prepared good breakfast, bacon and eggs and tri mmings, and the colonel and majors and captains were all assembled. There was one thing that I forgot to tell you, I had been told that the general was terribly worried about being take n prisoner by enlisted men, he thought he would be mistreated . So I decided I would make myself an officer. That was a risky thin g to do, to impersonate an officer in the army. But you know, we had a great deal of freedom in my cir \u0152 in other words, there was nobody telling me what to do when I went to the front lines. It was my decision to decide where, which camp to go to, whom to interview, which American officers to ask for cooperation. So, before going up in the hills, early in the morning, about eight or 8:30, I asked Germans where there was a drugstore, and I went to the drugstore, which wasn\u2122t open yet, rang the bell. The druggist answered when he saw, I guess, the military truck outside and looked worri ed, of course. And I said, I need a Band-Aid. Well, that was an easy request. So he immediately got a box of Band-Aids. And ask him for a scissors and I cut two pi eces of the rubberized part of the BandAid, which is white on the other side, and put it on the helmet and promoted myself to captain. And so, when I took the general into, you know, custody, I introduced myself as Captain Eaton , who had been sent by supreme headquarters to accept his Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 57surrender. So, you know, he felt sort of pleased that somehow supreme headquarters \u0152 and that may have had a fact \u0152 an impa ct on his re-readiness to cooperate. So I had told Harbie (ph) on the phone what I had do ne. And when I arrived everybody treated me as Captain Eaton , and \u0152 and my driver was sort of amazed that I \u0152 nobody criticized me, and then afterwards a decision was made to clear with supreme headquarters what to do with the general, that we would use him to work for us at Radio Luxembourg , and in the \u0152 the day or two that this might take, we put up the general in the hotel, and my job, I was in the same room with him, was to take him for walks, see to it that he got his rations, and talk to him. And then introduce him, bring him to different o fficers who wanted to talk to him, for whatever information they were interested in. And after da \u0152 a day or two, nothing happened. So I was able to talk to Captain Harber (ph), he said well, we are having problems with this man, and I don\u2122t know what\u2122s going to happen, but it doesn\u2122t look good, because some of the senior officials in Eisenhower\u2122s headquarters are concerned over the fact that you took th is general in Third Army territory and brought him to Luxembourg , when according to army rules, which you didn\u2122t know and I didn\u2122t know, you f \u0152 all prisoners of war have to be cleared through the prison camps. And you didn\u2122t clear him th rough the prison camp, you took him directly to headquarters. And some peop le are talking about court-martialing not Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 58only you, but me and the colonel. So, it took two weeks before a decision was made not to court-martial us."

            "answer": "Yeah, well, shortly before being sent overseas, apparently army policy was to naturalize enemy aliens, especially people like myself, w ho had a very high security position. So I was given a three day leave to travel to Chicago to go before a judge who \u0152 I don\u2122t think he ever tested me as normally citizenship people ar \u0152 application for citizenship, with being in the army, it \u0152 the whole thing was about five minutes. And the \u0152 so I had become a citizen. The \u0152 and I was a citizen in England and \u0152 when serving over i-in Germany. The \u0152 obviously w-we all knew what was \u0152 that the Germans were murdering Jews in large numbers. Exactly what was happening, we didn\u2122t know. You heard rumors of Auschwitz, you heard \u0152 you knew that in concentration camps many people were tortured, and some people were killed. But you didn\u2122t know any of the full details at all. And in my unit of 10 people, I think there were two who were not Jewish, all the others were. And we didn\u2122t talk about being Jewish. There were German refugees like myself and Captain Harber(ph), we knew had been born into a Jewish family, but we didn\u2122t know what his sympathies were, that he had been converted. And none of my fellow soldiers and I ever talked about the Jewish problem. They didn\u2122t seem to ever talk about it. And so, it \u0152 it\u2122s someth ing you kept to yourself, but I was very much aware, not only of what was \u0152 we knew was happening to Jews, that they had been murdered in large numbers in Russia, that \u0152 that we had heard. But I also Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 60knew that \u0152 what was going on in Palestine, so whenever there was news available, I was particularly interested in. And so, as a result, I took a special interest in Jews. And one of my assignments was to enter Germany as soon as we occupied a few villages around Aachen . And wherever I went, I would ask, are any \u0152 what happened to the Jews. And the \u0152 Monschau didn\u2122t have Jews, but in Aachen, which we occupied around oc \u0152 middle of October, and I arrived there maybe two or three days after occupation, I learned from the public relations officer that one Jew had bi \u0152 had survived. And the army ha d seen to it that he would get a s \u0152 a reasonable quarter, and he gave me the address. So, I \u0152 you know, I \u0152 wasn\u2122t difficult to find out where to go, because you asked people, and he was put into a building that had been \u0152 the upper part ha d been destroyed, but the first floor, the four walls were standing, there were no wi ndows, the door could not be closed, but it was better than most, you know, l-living in a cellar. And he had put a big sign on the door, Jude. And so when I came in and intro duced myself, he was very happy to see me. He had a chair and insisted I si t on the chair, and he stood, in his warm clothing, he had no gloves. So I gave him my gloves and a scarf, and we talked about what happened. And he explained to me that just before deportation, the Germans deported all the Jews from Aachen , but because they had Christian friends, he and his wife were able to move into the suburb and be hidden. Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 61Unfortunately, his wife got caught in the city, and his \u0152 was deported. He \u0152 but he survived. And he described hims elf as being a member of the B\u2122nai Brith and didn\u2122t know any Hebrew, but he had been to synagogues and knew something about prayers. And he thought that probably he would be safe now in Aachen . But \u0152 and that\u2122s why he put the sign up, and he felt that he was \u0152 he didn\u2122t know of any other Jew who survived. Well, apparently the people in military government looked after him subsequently. He was seep \u0152 he got a job in military government as somebody who could be trusted, and ultimately turned out to be a member of the city council and became head of a new Jewish community, because there were a few survivors who drifted back to Aachen and so the province decided to facilitate the development of a Jewish community, and he actually became its head, I think, for the rest of his life."

Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 63So, the local commander said okay, I\u2122ll give you your own barracks. And \u0152 and that happened within \u0152 on the first day. So I went to the Jewish barrack and introduced myself, and we sat down, I said, what are the problems? Are you getting enough food? And they said, well, we\u2122re getting our share. And \u0152 but they were complaining about the administrative problems they had of getting recognized as a nationality. So we discussed the political aspects, pointed out to them that the British government had a strong, vested interest in preventing the establishment of Jews as a separate nationality, because of what was th \u0152 their commitment in Palestine, that they had made a decision that they made a mistake in 1917, there were many more Arabs than Jews, and they didn\u2122t \u0152 they didn\u2122t want to lose support of the Muslims, and so they had made an agreement, and until that can be overturned, the British were pushing very hard to oppose recognition of Jews. But on the other hand, Jews shouldn\u2122t be worri ed, and simply, they had the power to refuse. They should insist on whatever th ey want, because there was strong political support of their position in the American Jewish community, and to some extent in the British community. So they had done the right thing and they should be very assertive and so on. So we talked about that, basically was mos \u0152 much of the time.

We didn\u2122t encounter any Russian troops, because Theresienstadt was pretty close to as far as the Russians got. The Americans \u0152 Patton had actually gotten to Prague, and then later had to withdraw from Prague because of an agreement that Eisenhower had made with Stalin that Czechoslovakia would be turned over to them, so \u0152 but at that time, the first time we encountered Russians was in Theresienstadt. And we were not allowed to enter the camp, because \u0152 the explanation wa s there was a typhus epidemic, and we would have to wait until it was under contro l. So for about two days, we found a place to sleep, we waited til the camp was open, and then over to Theresienstadt and ask for the commanding officer. Well, being the only American I\u2122m taken immediately to the right place, and was invited into the barrack where he was Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 67sitting, a room like this. And he\u2122s surrounded by a few people talking Russian. And I showed him my orders and he called over a translator to look at my orders and tell him what they were, and saw the signature of my officer. So, pat me down, and then said [phone ringing] \u0152 so, it\u2122s easier to talk on the phone without the hearing aid, because apparently they interfere with each other. So, b-before he answered me about the information, he said, through this interpreter, why are the Americans killing Russian soldiers? I said , that\u2122s impossible, they are our allies, they liberated, th-they \u0152 he said, well, I read it in \ufb01 Pravda .\ufb02 I said, I certainly will check into it, and we [indecipherable] headquarters [indecipherable] . I didn\u2122t ask him for a copy of the report in \ufb01 Pravda .\ufb02 It didn\u2122t \u0152 after that exchange, he dropped the matter. And he said, I s \u0152 I \u0152 I\u2122m sending so mebody to talk to the head of the Jewish community, so they will get ready, to get the names ready for you. And he poured a glass of liquor and offered me a big glass lik e that. And I realized that I could never keep up with him, so I cur \u0152 it occurred to me how to get out of it, I said, I \u0152 I have a very sad problem. He says, what\u2122s the problem? I have a ruptured thorax, and alcohol will irritate it, I can\u2122t drink anything. Well, he fe lt very bad about me, but he wanted to drink. And the whole table had been filled with bottles. I mean, the alc \u0152 the conc \u0152 the alcoholism among the u pper level command was apparent. And underneath the table were radios that ha d been confiscated, so he offered me a Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 68radio, which I explained to him I had one, so I didn\u2122t want to deprive others of the radio, so I didn\u2122t take a radio. But then I was taken by a Russian soldier to meet Leo Baeck, who was in charge of the Jewish community. And we sat down on his bed."

And it was on my page, and then Harber(ph) decided that was a good story, so that became \u0152 was reprinted in all the other newspapers. So some of th e stories I wrote were copied, and I came to the conclusion that the German governor of Bavaria was not too sympathetic towards Jews, because he urged that the policy that had been adopted that Jews Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 79would get double rations, because they had been so deprived and emaciated, he felt that was unfair.

So I took a lot of the photographs that I thought would be of interest, many of which I gave to, you know, delivered in Bad Nauheim, but I kept some that interested me. And I also took some books of Hitler Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 81that \u0152 like a copy of \ufb01Mein Kampf\ufb02 and photographic books of the fuehrer that came from his library. And I had the printing office make me a printed message that it was taken from Hitler\u2122s birthplace. And then I met with the \u0152 Mi-Miss Fagas(ph), and said, what are you going to do with Hitler\u2122s birthplace? He says, I don\u2122t know. It\u2122s certainly something you have to deal w ith. I said, I have an idea, let\u2122s make it into a museum of the outra \u0152 atrocities of the Nazis. He liked that idea, and so he said, all right, we\u2122ll do it. And, what are you going to exhibit? Well, he said, that \u0152 we have to get information of things that could be put there, like maybe the Nuremburg laws, and some of the info \u0152 illustrations of Nazi\u2122s atrocities. And I offered to get some placards that could be exhibited, and when I went back to Straubing, I got ahold of the local Catholic priest and told him that there was a museum, and I was wondering where there were some Biblical phrases that he could think of that would appropriately describe the evil of the Nazis. So \u0152"

The \u0152 the Germans who had been running the Nazi printing plant became my employees, because there was no one else. In other words, we didn\u2122t replace them. Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 82And they were very cooperative. I neve r \u0152 no one ever asked me about being Jewish, but I\u2122m sure they all knew, and because you know, obviously, I spoke such good German, and my secretary, who wa s bi \u0152 by that time was known she was Jewish. And there also was a incident, my fa \u0152 my secretary, after she was freed, she had to fill out a questionnaire and she was afraid to reveal that she was not Polish. She didn\u2122t trust the Germans, the \u0152 our officers. So she filled it out according to her false papers, not realizing that she was providing false information. And when she openly admitted that she was of German background and of Jewish background and not Polish, the \u0152 one of the \u0152 the sia \u0152 the security people decided she had violated the law, she had falsified her identity, and charged her for having done so. I talked to them, and they says, we have no choice, she did it, and we have to prosecute. So I wrote up a defense and th ere was a trial, so this was public. The other thing that surely made clear to peop le that I was Jewish was the fact that I found out that there was a synagogue in Straubing. And so they showed me where it was. It was dirty and had been used as a storeroom, but it hadn\u2122t been burned in Kristallnacht because it was a building in a whole row of buildings, undistinguished, and if you had tried to burn it, you would have burned others \u0152 places down. So I decided it needed to be restored, and went to the German \u0152 th-the \u0152 well, I think the mayor actually came to my office when I asked for it. I told him Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 83this \u0152 we had to clean up the synagogue, and I ask him also th at this be done by people who had damaged it, if their name s could be identified. And he was not a Nazi, he had been put in the office. So he was able apparently, to find out who did it, and so the members of the family, who had been in the SS or SA and had damaged the interior of the building, had to come with brooms and paintbrushes and clean up the place."

The brigade just had enough au tonomy to arrange their \u0152 the mission \u0152 the execution of the missions that they had, mostly transportation. They had trucks to move from Italy to Holland and Belgium , and they did a lot of transporting. So what they did is they orga nized their crews so that about two-thirds did the work and one-third were released to \u0152 given ex-extended leave to go into eastern Europe to either visit the s \u0152 village or city where they came from, and to help Jews to organize, in order to get to the American zone, because th-there was no future for Jews in eastern Europe . And in order to increase the number of Jews who wanted to go to Palestine, you had to first bring them to Germany. And so there were agents of the Jewish Brigade, whose job it was to go into Czechoslovakia and Poland , and Straubing is close to the Czech border. So they had my name and telephone number so they could call me from Munich and say they needed my advice, could I see them? And I wo \u0152 of course always would say yes. And this way I became well-known, apparently, on this group of underground workers, and they would come to Straubing and they needed a place to sleep at night, which I could provide, and food. And then I would get them to the Czech border."

            "answer": "Well, my job ended when the newspaper was turned over back to a German editorial board, about November \u212245. By that time, nearly all the newspapers, maybe with a week or two difference, we re turned over to the Germans, and the program of U.S. operated German newspapers came to an end. And I had Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 86accumulated enough points to be sent home. But because of the fact that there was a army program that permitted soldiers in Europe to visit relatives if they were available, I decided to take advant age of that, and I went, I think to Bad Nauheim , and asked to meet with my brother in Palestine. And that was approved, but a few hours later, while waiting around, I was told sorry, Sergeant Eaton, Palestine is closed. The British have closed Camp Litwinski, near Tel Aviv , a recreational facility for American sailors and soldiers, and ask all Americans to leave. There\u2122s no way for you to go to Palestine because there were several generals who wanted to go to Palestine for Christmas, but who were refused. So I f \u0152 thought quickly, and said, but could I meet my brother in Cairo? If you can get transportation. So I gave them the address of a school friend at Cornell University, a Jew from Iraq , who had moved from Baghdad to Cairo , and I knew his address because he had sent me an invitation to his wedding in Cairo . So I got permission to go [indecipherable] I wanted to see my brother, and so they approved it. And when the orders were printed, they were prin ted like all other orders, to carry out the instructions of the commander, without specifying anything except I was put on detached duty for two weeks in Cairo to carry out instructions of the theater commander. That was Eisenhower . So, my commanding officer, who knew why I was leaving, what I went doing, said that\u2122s wonderful. I don\u2122t care how long you Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 87stay, because when you g-go back, you going home. We don\u2122t need you any more. So again, I\u2122m not sure every commanding officer would have taken that position. So, I had to find my way to go to Cairo . Well, there was no \u0152 I didn\u2122t get orders, transportation orders, because there was no way to get to Cairo from Straubing , Germany. So I packed up a duffel bag and hitchhiked to Rome, because I knew in Rome we had an air force base, and I had found out that we had planes flying from Rome to the Middle East. So when I got to Rome , I found out that there were no planes going to Palestine, there were no planes going to Cairo , but there were a lot of planes going to India, and they had to stop off in Baghdad to refuel. So, showing my orders, I got orders to fly to Baghdad and then I would find a way of going to Cairo from Baghdad . Nobody told me how I would do it. I got to Baghdad , and in Baghdad a British officer looking at my orders said, you are very lucky Sergeant Eaton , we have a plane going to Cairo in an hour. But I didn\u2122t want to go to Cairo, I want to go to Palestine. So I said, well I can\u2122t go to Cairo now, I have to go to Baghdad first. He said, it doesn\u2122t say in your orders. I said, I have to go to Baghdad first. And, I can\u2122t let you go to Baghdad , it\u2122s does \u0152 not in your orders. So I said, would you put in writing that you\u2122re refusing to let me go to Baghdad ? He didn\u2122t want to do that, so instead, he accepted my request and he issued a voucher for me to go to the best hotel in Baghdad, where the British Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 88officers were staying, to get a room at British expense. And I said I would find a way of getting to Cairo by bus. And I did. I got ahold of a bus, there were bus service every few days from Baghdad to Damascus . And from Damascus I got a ba \u0152 a bus to Ruspina. And then I spent three and a half weeks in Palestine, in American uniform, knowing that under British rules, I\u2122m not supposed to be there. No one ever stopped me."

In \u212246 the British felt they could not change the policy in Palestine, and therefore actually you had a rebellion of Jews against the British. And the whole uncertainty of what would happen to all these displaced persons, the ba \u0152 of course, after my newspaper was over, and I no longer had a position, I \u0152 I was offered a job in military government in Germany by the U.S. Army, with a pro \u0152 with a promotion to captain. But I didn\u2122t want to live among Ge rmans, and I wanted to finish my academic career, so \u0152 and I didn\u2122t really like the American policy in general, which was to work very closely w ith the lower level German officials, which I didn\u2122t particularly like, although today I realize that if we had done what we did in Iraq, of dismissing the infrastructure of Saddam Hussein, we really didn\u2122t have the Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 89means to govern the country. And so we rea lly didn\u2122t have much of a choice, except to use a great many officials in the same positions that they had occupied under the Nazis, as long as they had not been exce ssively active, and known to have been \u0152 have \u0152 have en-engaged in atrocities. So major anti-Semites, judges who convicted too many people to death for stealing food , or for racial fo \u0152 fo \u0152 disapproved sexual relations or things like that, they lo st their job. But most judges, most Nazi judges stayed as Nazi judges. And so by the time I could have become maybe the governor of this or that city in Germany, I would have had to deal with these kinds of officials, so no, I wanted to finish my PhD . So that \u0152 the \u0152 but certainly the \u0152 one other thing is, once I started to go back i \u0152 go into teaching, my focus was on my professional career. So I had research ideas, and I got adequate funding for research. So I focused on research, I didn\u2122t return to my army da ys or take a look at my extensive files of what happened in World War II. I didn\u2122t think of myself of somebody who was a historian of Germany, World War II. I had lots of interesting records of things I did, and they were put in boxes, and these boxes got transported from this home to that home, and I was alwa ys too busy to really look at them, of what was in there, because I had many ot her interesting professional challenges, until after my retirement, I started looking at the material. And I\u2122m now engaged in writing a history of how my family inter acted with the German culture over many Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 90centuries. Because one has to face the fact that historically, Germany was never just a country of Germans. There was alwa ys an existing minority that had a very important function, namely the Jews."

            "answer": "Yes. The \u0152 I mean, for hundreds of years, on both sides of my family, they remained Orthodox, even though a large proportion of the German Jews became Reform Jews. On my father\u2122s side they were quite cons ervative. On my mother\u2122s side, they took advantage of modern secular education, but they remained Orthodox. I had relatives as far back as 1835 who went to Palestine, because they wanted to live there. I \u0152 on my mother\u2122s side, I had people going to Palestine, 1882. The \u0152 so that my family was clearly Orthodox. Two of my brothers remained Orthodox. My oldest brother and I, especia lly under the influence of the Holocaust, I became convinced there is no superior po-power looking after exactly what\u2122s happening to any of us. And that if there is some rational power that explains the incredible complexity, and the \u0152 the uniformity of many things in nature; the fact that we have DNA that we shor \u0152 share with earthworms and with butterflies. There\u2122s s-some incredible rationality that somehow has developed an evolution for Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 91which I have no explanation. But I don\u2122t th ink there is a god wh o decides that I\u2122ve been a good person, or I have had significant faults, on the basis of which my afterlife would be. So, I \u0152 I am not an Orthodox Jew today. And \u0152 but I am identified with the Jewish community for ethnic reasons. So from that point of view, I had an opportunity to do things during those unus ual periods of time, which the only other time I was able to express my interest in being Jewish is when I took a job for five years to establish a school of social work in Haifa University, and they needed an outside person who was not involved in Israeli politics. And so they brought me in because university wanted to establish a school that would compete with Hebrew University and have a different ideol ogy, so I took that job."
