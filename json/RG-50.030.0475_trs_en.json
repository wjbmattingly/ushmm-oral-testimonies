            "question": "And does the company continue?",
            "answer": "No. Unfortunately, there\u2019ve been many mishaps after the war. First of all production stopped because we couldn\u2019t get the material from England. There were no -- there was no way to do that. Then we had to go into hiding, and the factory closed because also the Germans took over. And they destroyed some of the machinery, and some of it became barracks for the troops. So there was no way the factory could operate. After the war it was in very bad shape, and there was no money to start it over, but somehow the bank gave us a loan, and we started, but with half or a quarter of the people, and the production was very limited. So it was kind of limping for a war -- a while. Then, for several years it was a real, real struggle to -- to make it go. Material was difficult to get, and general the economic conditions were too bad. So finally the bank repossessed it, and that was the end of that factory. It became a warehouse for grain for the whole region, and now they have made it into technical schools. There\u2019s a gimna -- gimnasium, which is like a high school, and also technical schools for the rich. But the interesting thing 1s, they kept the facade, which was in -- 1t was, I mean architecturally it was a very -- it was the thing of the time. The roof was kind of slanted, and that they kept, but they also kept the name, and they call it Moudzoukos Technical Schools. There\u2019s also a bus stop called Moudzoukos stop."

She worked in the orphanage, and another kind of -- of -- what call this, and I always remember that she had teas in the house, and all these ladies will come, and there were beautiful things like cakes and cookies, and that we have to dress up, and come and say hello to the ladies, and curtsy, which I didn\u2019t like.

And when I would to go bed, she would be there. My parents took trips to Austria. They often traveled to Switzerland and Austria. So there were extended periods of time that they were not there.

If she had friends over, I wanted to be in that group. And she didn\u2019t want me to be there. Her friends were marvelous, they would ask me to come and stay, and talk to them, but she didn\u2019t want me in there. She -- she was caring, very caring for me.

My governess, who spoke French, and I had to speak French with her, would take me to the park, and there would be other children there, and we would play all sorts of things. In the summer I would go swimming every day. We would take little train from Volos, which would go up to the mountain of Pilion, but it would stop at the beach called Anaboros, and we would get off. There were -- the wagons were regular wagons [indecipherable | there were two of them that were opened, so it was like a coach, and that\u2019s where I sat.

I went to the synagogue with my mother on special occasions to take oil to the synagogue. This was a practice that is a good deed.

My parents would give big parties, there was -- there were always a lot of people around. They were very well known, and it was like, you know, a constant stream of people coming through our house, or going places.

I remember when I went in school the day the war -- we heard the -- about the war, all the children- the older children anyway, were telling us that people get killed in the war, that men leave their homes, and go to battle, they get injured. And I was very worried about my father. So when the principal told us that there would be no school that day, and they didn\u2019t know if there was going to be school the next day, I ran home crying, asking my mother if my father was going to be the -- in the war, if he was going to be in the army. Well, my father was 40 -- 42 I think then. So my mother calmed me down and reassures me that this wasn\u2019t going to happen, and that I didn\u2019t have anything to worry about, we\u2019ll all be together, we\u2019ll be fine.

            "answer": "Okay, so we moved, as I said, we came on these two different boats that took about 10 days to get to Athens, and normally the trip is like two days at the most. In Athens my uncle, who was my father\u2019s younger brother who lived there, had found a place for us. It was an apartment at -- we had one floor, my aunt and grandmother had another in the same building. And we went there. It was spring, so I didn\u2019t go to school, because school would have been over pretty soon. And I guess we were trying to -- to get acquainted to -- to the city, and to -- to find our way around. There wasn\u2019t much we were doing as far as I was concerned. My only playmate was my cousin, who was I|1 years old -- I mean, 11 months older than me, and we were constant companions. I don\u2019t remember having friends, or being encouraged to -- to make friends. Since I didn\u2019t go to school, of course I couldn\u2019t meet other children. Then, in September of 1943, we went into hiding. And the events prior to this, I remember them very clearly. I had the mumps, and I was in bed, and the dining room was adjacent to the bedroom. So my -- all my aunts, and uncles came and they were having meetings with my parents in this dining room, and I could hear them whispering. I could not make out any words, but I knew something very serious was going on. And obviously they were planning where each one was going to go, what they were going to do, and it was like a big family meeting. My sister was in that -- in that meeting. Occasionally she would come out and check on me, to make sure I was all right, or put some hot pads on my cheeks, which was the normal treatment. And then she would go back in the room. And when I would ask what is it that -- why are you all in there, and she would say, \u201cWell, we -- we just need to discuss some adult things. Don\u2019t worry, everything is fine.\u201d And but of course I worried, because I knew everything wasn\u2019t fine. So I remember that very, very clearly."

So some advance thinking, at least to have the plan, and if you need to use it, you use it. It was necessary to do that time."

Some decided the very last moment to go somewhere, because this is something you don\u2019t want to believe that this going to happen. It\u2019s pretty unbelievable. So most people denied as wildly exaggerating, or this isn\u2019t going to happen to us. But people with advanced thinking, and people who know about the world, I guess, don\u2019t leave things to chances. And my father was one of these people."

We didn\u2019t have neighbors -- actually, there was a lady but 1 -- who lived in the same building, but I think she was also Jewish. And we pretty much stayed with the family.

It wa -- I don\u2019t think it was our furniture, I don\u2019t recall. So this probably was a -- a furnished place when we arrived. As far as clothing, I think we took whatever we needed, which wasn\u2019t much at the time. Maybe some books. I took my favorite doll. I was a big doll person. And I guess that was it, but no utensils, or anything else, because when we were into hiding, we lived with other families, not Jewish families, Greek Orthodox families, so they had their own household."

            "answer": "Well, I think it was a devastating thing to find that you cannot trust people, on top of everything else that\u2019s happening. At least there were people you could count on, and you cannot count on them. And you really don\u2019t know to whom you can turn when things are bad. I think that was the story in the -- the experience. How can she be so blatant, and say, we didn\u2019t get it, they didn\u2019t give it to us."

            "question": "And then wa -- when it comes to going into hiding, you had to know that you could trust the people that you were going to be with. What do you know about the -- how the family split up, who you stayed with.",
            "answer": "Okay, first of all, my father had found this place through a friend, a very good friend of his. He had baptized the oldest child, by the name of Many Babella, and he knew the family well. So he had talked to them, and they had agreed to take us. Of course, families could not -- families could not be together if there were more than two, three people, because they could be easily spotted, and they had to disperse. My father went to some other family, and my mother and I, and sister, went to Calivare, which is a suburb of Athens, to this wonderful family of a couple, the name was Pavella. And they had three children, a 15 year old, and one girl who was Kate, she was 10, as I was, and a younger boy about six or seven, called Dimitris. My mother, sister, and I shared one room. So the three of us shared one room, my father was elsewhere, and we had our meals with the family, I was playing with the children, who were about the same age as I was. I wasn\u2019t going to school, and my excuse was that I had appendicitis. And I wasn\u2019t supposed to go to school. This was what I was telling the children. Of course, they all wanted to see my incision, and there was no incision. Basically, I liked these kids, and they were just great, they were warm, and would play all sorts of games, and we had a great connection. My mother would communicate with my father once a week by telephone, and this was like a coded message. When the news were bad, the message was, the patient is very sick. When the news was better, it was that, well, the patient is doing better. So, this was a pre-arranged kind of code for them to communicate. My sister became good friends with the sister of the woman who hid us, the family there. She had a bakery right across from where we were. And my sister would go there sometimes, and also Adhero will come to -- to the house. She was very warm, and caring, and often will bring cookies from the bakery."

        },
        {
            "num": 110,
            "question": "And then -- well, loo -- let\u2019s go ahead.",
            "answer": "Yeah, I couldn\u2019t go to school, because that involves being outside, and being in public. The -- the fear was that somebody may recognize us. Same thing for my mother and sister, we couldn\u2019t venture very far other than across the street to the bakery, because although we had left Volos, where we were very well known, and in Athens we were more -- more unknown people, it still the possibility that somebody would recognize us, and mention our names, and then everybody will be in great peril. Of course, the family that hid us was in danger by hiding us. These were wonderful people. He worked for -- the man of the family worked for a Greek newspaper, so he could bring home news of what was going on. His wife was also a very good housekeeper, caring for the children, and very nice, and my mother and Dasseia became friends. And even after the war they would see each other. And there was great respect for each other. So there was- there were good feelings there, and a good connection. As I said, we couldn\u2019t go out, we couldn\u2019t do things that we normally used to do. But maybe for my mother this was a big loss, but for me it was fun because there were children to play with. At some point, I think 1t was probably around December, which was like three months after we went into hiding to the Pavella family, my father joined us. I guess he had become very lonely in the family he was with in Athens, and he decided to come to be with us. Of course, this was with the agreement of the family we lived in. But shortly after, I remember it very clearly, one evening, Adhero, the -- the wife\u2019s sister, who had the bakery, came running to the house, and saying, \u201cYou must leave immediately. I heard from somebody that they know you are Jewish, and you are hiding.\u201d We used to tell, or the family used to tell that we were relatives, because sometimes we would be out in the yard, and people would ask, who are these people? They say they were relatives. And this man, who happened to be drunk, and he was in a tavern, in a Greek tavern, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t get fooled, these people are not relatives of the Pavella family, they are Jews, and they are hiding.\u201d So it was heard by everybody who was in that tavern, and Adhero happened to be there. And she ran and told us to leave immediately. Well, the first one who left was my father, because he was in greater danger. And he walked from Calivare to Athens with the man of the family, Milanos Pavella. He wouldn\u2019t let him go by himself. He took him on foot. And the next night, all three of us, my mother, my sister, and I, when it became dark, we also left with him. He came back, of course, after taking my father to a friend\u2019s house in Athens. He came back and took us to -- to Athens. Now this is about, I don\u2019t know, probably -- I remember walking for a long, long, long time in the night. I don\u2019t know exactly how far it is, but I\u2019m sure it must be like six miles, 10 miles from Athens. So it\u2019s a long walk for a 10 year old. And we had put scarfs on our heads, and tied them so people wouldn\u2019t recognize us immediately. So when we go to Athens, we immediately went where my father was, at the friend\u2019s house. Now these were very good friends, who were notified, apparently, when this incident of somebody saying that we were Jews occurred. And they were looking for a place for us to go. But until they found a place, we couldn\u2019t stay together, because they were in danger. So my sister went to a friend\u2019s house, one of her friends from Volos, that family lived in Athens, and they took her. And I went -- they took me to somebody\u2019s house in Athens, and all I remember, it was like a mansion, a huge place. And there lived a man in a wheelchair. I think he was an old man, but here again [indecipherable] wrong, being 10 years old -- and a woman who was taking care of him. I don\u2019t think she was a relative, I think she was a caretaker. And I was left there for 10 days by myself, not having communication with my family, not knowing what was going on, not knowing these people. I think this man didn\u2019t talk to me, or if he did, it must have been one or two words, or maybe he couldn\u2019t talk. I remember the woman feeding him, spoonfeeding him, so obviously he was pretty sick. And I was desperate. I was totally lost. I didn\u2019t know what happened to my parents, I didn\u2019t know if they would ever pick me up. But the woman, the caretaker of this man was a very kind woman, so when I would cry, she would try to comfort me, or tell me stories, or all sorts of things, just to make me feel good about it. Well, in about 10 days, my sister came, and she said, \u201cWe have a place now. I\u2019m ga -- I\u2019m here to pick you up, to take you.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she had called before or not, I don\u2019t recall. But I took my little satchel of things, a couple of changes of clothe -- clothes, and my doll, and said good-bye and left. And we went -- we met again at this friend\u2019s house, and we went, I think in installments again, my father went first, or we went first, to the second house, where we spent about seven months. This was in Kipserly. It was the family of Andonis Vayas, who was an officer in the navy. And they had -- he and his wife had the little girl about three years old. And I think there was a grandmother who was deaf, and also lived in the house, but we hardly saw her. She stayed in her room for the most time. Anyway, so it was a new adjustment. We had a very large room for the four of us, so there was like a -- a screen put in the middle, so on one side where my parents were sleeping, and on the other side was my sister and I. We were sharing the other side of the room. And we were closer to the street, it was on a street level, and closer to the street. I slept on a cot. And I remember at night I would hear the Germans patrolling, and I could hear their boots going by my window. And I would stop breathing. I was so petrified, because I thought they were coming for us. And I would pull the blanket over my head, and stop breathing, I -- until I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t do it any more, and I had to breathe. So then slowly I will pull the blanket off my head, and I would listen very carefully, and by then the steps with the boots -- because I knew -- I knew they were boots, would disa -- have disappeared, or they would have gone away, or they were far, so I knew we were safe. This was my biggest fear, that they would come and get us. Here again, I didn\u2019t go to school. My father tried to teach me some arithmetic, and I think I had two books, \u201cRobinson Crusoe,\u201d and another one, which was a rather gloomy book called, \u201cThe Orphans of Scotland.\u201d And it was nothing but -- you know, five orphans, or maybe more, whose father was in prison, and how they got him out of prison in a basket, and things like that. But it was a rather sad book, if I remember correctly. Then I got hold of a children\u2019s magazine heyou -- I think it was a weekly magazine. I don\u2019t know who gave it to us, or how I got hold of it, and it had wonderful stories, and this was very nice for me too, to read. Other than that, think my imagination went wild, because I used to play in the backyard, and all I would do 1s pick up bamboo stick, and pretend it was a gun, and was shooting all the Germans. And we were free, I thought, by me doing that. Games like this. Occasional I will play with a three year old little girl. But that was about it. The backyard had a fence, and the next house was also a two story house, I think, and in the balcony there was a little girl who would be out practically every day, and playing with dolls, and other toys. And I would go next to the fence, and we started talking. And she would always invite me to go to her house to play. But of course, I knew I couldn\u2019t, so I would find all sorts of excuses that I couldn\u2019t go. But one time I couldn\u2019t bear it any more, so I jumped the fence. On our side of the yard, the fence was reasonably manageable, I could go over it. But when I jumped, it was very high on her side. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t break a leg. So I jumped the fence, and went to her apartment and played there for awhile. Of course, nobody in my family knew that I left the house. But when it was time for me to go back, I just couldn\u2019t climb the fence, it was too much. So finally I decided I had to go around the corner, because this house was around the corner. So I came, and rang the doorbell, and of course the woman opened the door, and she was SO surprised to see me. And my mother came, and she was absolutely pale when she saw me. I got a good spanking for that, I remember. I wasn\u2019t supposed to -- to leave the house, especially not telling anybody. But it was that urge to be with other children, to be able to play, to be -- to have a normal life like any other child that made me do that."

They were watching the house in -- the third house, and -- no, actually, the second house in Kipserly. And one day they burst in, pretending they were people from the power company, and they wanted to read the meter, but they came in with guns, and they were asking for Moudzoukos. And they took him, and fortunately he had money on him. He had British pounds that were all sewn around his west -- waistband, and he paid them. And they told him that he and his family had to leave within five hours, and they didn\u2019t guarantee his safety, or anybody else\u2019s safety. So when they came to get my father -- panic-stricken my mother, and my sister, and me -- my sister went next door -- here again, she jumped from a terrace to the next terrace, where there were people that had help us find this house as well. And this was in -- somebody in the -- I think in the Supreme Court, or -- he was in charge, anyway, and we knew them. So she notify them, and they notified another friend, who immediately came -- nearby there was a market, and he was watching the house to see the activity and what was going on. And as soon as they brought my father back, he came in the house and took us to his house. And from there he found another place for us. So I think we stayed overnight, or maybe a couple of days, until a second hou -- a third house was found. And that\u2019s when we moved again."

I have a feeling that at the time, it was just for expenses, but I know that after the war, they were very much helped by my father when things started going much better. Because I remember this navy officer who would come often, and ask for a loan, or things like that. And then my father would forgive the loan.

They were very courageous people to do that, and they were great human beings to be able to -- to help somebody else at such a risk, yes, because if anybody was found to be sheltering Jews, could be shot, he and his family.

She said, \u201cYou know, the -- the Nazi may come and take them.\u201d And Milanos said, \u201cOver my dead body.\u201d So he had a very sense -- a very good sense of protecting us, of not letting anything happen to us. That\u2019s why he dro -- he -- he walk with my father from Calivare to Athens, and the next day he walk back again with my sister -- my mother, and my sister, and myself. So, I mean, he was a man who would take it very seriously that this was the lives of people that were under his care, and he wouldn\u2019t let anything happen, I mean, as far as he could control that."

            "answer": "For me, it was a good time, because I had company. I mean, it was great to have the children, who were fun children to be with. The chores were like sitting -- setting the table, or things like that. We all had dinner together, we all ate together. I think the cooking was done by my mother, and by Desseia. Desseia would do the shopping, or sometimes Milanos, the father, would do the shopping. And they would take turns cooking. And as far as cleaning, I think we were responsible for cleaning our room, making our beds, doing the laundry, or setting it out, I don\u2019t remember, in those days you were just washing, you know, by hand. So I think things were divided that way. For me, I remember I would wait impatiently until the children will come home from school, because that was the fun time I could play with. During the day my mother tried to engage me in teaching me how to embroider, or how to sew, and I had no interest whatsoever in any of these sedentary activities. Plus my eyes were not very good, so I couldn\u2019t concentrate on a little hole there for hours. I -- I -- I may have had one or two books, but basically I think I had a vivid imagination and I would make up stories. And when the children will come, I will tell them stories, or they will tell me jokes, and this kind of thing. We didn\u2019t go out, but yet had a huge yard, and that was nice, because we could play outside."

But there was a 10 -- 10 year difference, so you can imagine that her clothes didn\u2019t quite fit me right, even if the hem was put up.

I mean, it sounds as if for you, when you were at the Pavellas, it was not a difficult time, perhaps because you -- I mean, it was difficult in the sense that 1t was -- you couldn\u2019t go to school, but that -- maybe I\u2019m wrong in saying it was not difficult, but not painfully difficult like the time when you were abandoned and alone.",
            "answer": "Right. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sure it was very difficult for my mother, first of all because my father was elsewhere, and for my sister, because she was older, and she could understand the dangers, and whatever was going on. So, since I didn\u2019t know that much about what was going on in the world, you know, I wasn\u2019t particularly worried. I was worried about my father, and I wanted my father to be with us, and I was told he eventually will be with us, but that was about it. I -- I didn\u2019t feel deprived, although, you know, food was not really -- it was difficult to get food. So I remember some of the dishes, it was like cabbage with rice, and carrots. And to this day I make it, and I think exactly of -- of that time. I loved it, it was great dish. You know, I mean, meat, eggs, fish probably were not available that much, and they were expensive. So, you know, when you have a large family to feed, it\u2019s considerable. But yes, it wasn\u2019t a painful time for me. It was more of a -- of an interesting time, or a fun time, I would think. But the other two places we went, it was a more painful time, because number one, I lost the children, you know, I -- I didn\u2019t have my friends any more. So that was a big loss when we left. And they -- I was asking Many when I saw her a couple of years ago, how was it for them when we left? And what did their parents tell them? And she said they missed us terribly, because we had become very connected. The second house, the Vaia house, I was -- I was upset most of the time because -- a little bit of it was boredom, a little bit of 1t was inability to go out and do things. Just -- I felt stagnated, there wasn\u2019t much to do. But I knew that everybody else was trying very hard to -- to put a good face for the other person, so I was trying to be cheerful, so my parents won\u2019t get upset."

Occasionally, I was allowed to talk to my father, but here again it was very brief, and it was like -- I was told never to mention names, like his name -- well, his name was Daddy, but never to mention my sister\u2019s name is Yola, or things like that.

The news came, I think from the radio that we were free, October 12\", in Athens, later in other places, going north, as the Germans started retreating. It was -- I think it was the radio, but I also think that the man of the house, of the third house, came and said, \u201cThe Germans are leaving, we are free.\u201d And I remember my sister and the -- the daughter of the household, her name was Maria, she was older than me, but she was closer to my sister age, and they were dancing. So we listened to the radio, and I think some people also came to announce the freedom, that we were free now. They didn\u2019t know we were Jewish, but they came to say the Germans have left, or are leaving. And it was going to be a big celebration downtown in Athens. So my sister and Maria were going to go, and I wanted to go with them. I was crying to go with them. They wouldn\u2019t let me because I was too young. And apparently a lot of crowds were there, you know, so they could have let me go get a sense of what was going on, but anyway, they -- I couldn\u2019t go. So I stayed home with my parents, but Yola, my sister, and Maria went, and they came home about 12 o\u2019clock, and they was telling us it was such a frenzy, 1t was wonderful, everybody was jumping and laughing, and it was -- it was great."

            "answer": "I think that was more of the case with me. I think even after we were liberated, we were very burdened because we had no money, we had lost the factory at the time. We had no furniture. So we had to start life from the beginning, to pick up the pieces. And I think my parents were very concerned that they were -- they didn\u2019t want -- I don\u2019t know about my sister, but they didn\u2019t want me to be unhappy, and to have a bad childhood. Here we had everything, and they had planned for everything, and here comes Hitler, and you know, he turns your life upside down. So I think they tried to shelter me, maybe a little too much, but I think I didn\u2019t grow up as fast as I thought I would have liked to."

            "answer": "Okay. Schools progress normally except I had a great difficulty in school. Part of it was I didn\u2019t have the skills to study, or I couldn\u2019t even do arithmetic. Things that you learn in third grade, I had skipped second, third, and fourth grade, basically. Because also, during the Italian war, school was a [indecipherable] you know, whenever. It was -- so it was very hard for me. I didn\u2019t know the basics, let\u2019s put it this way. But I got up. But I always had this feeling that I was lagging, I was behind. And this was a very uncomfortable feeling for me. I was ashamed of it, that I didn\u2019t know as much as the other children knew. My greatest extra-curricular activity was joining the Girl Scouts. You see, I always loved the Brownies when we were in Volos, as I said before, but as soon as Metaxess, who was a dictator, Fascist, decided that the Girl Scout movement, and the Boy Scout movement had to cease and all children should joined Apon, which was the youth organization. But Jews were not included, so I could not participate. So I always felt so hurt, because of that. And after the -- after the liberation, and when things started falling into place slowly, my goal was to become a Girl Scout. I was dying to. We didn\u2019t know any troops, any Girl Scout troops, how do you go about it. But I made sure I found out where the headquarters were, and I wrote a letter to the region officers there, a wonderful woman, by the name of Mrs. Sareefee, and I told her that I was a Brownie when I was little, and now I\u2019m out of hiding, and I want to become a Girl Scout. And she wrote back and -- a very warm letter that I read, and read, and knew by heart, because that was the letter I had under my pillow. Every night I read it. And she told me that troop number 21 is not far from where I live, and my mother could get me there, and they used to meet on Saturdays again. And sure enough my mother took me, and she met the leaders, wonderful women. And it was from then on I was -- my life was nothing but the Girl Scouts. It was the most wonderful experience for me to be with this group."

To be going on outings, like excursions, to do service work. And I was very, very welcome. To this day, I go to Greece, and I see friends that I made in my Girl Scout years. I meet them there. They write to me. In fact, they send me a yearbook lately. Every February -- 22\u2122 of February, it\u2019s considered the day of thinking, they call it Thinking Day. It was the day that the re -- the Baden Powell, and his wife Olivia, when they formed Girl Scouts, they would correspond with other people, and they had set this day as the Girl Scout day, thinking of each other. So it somehow kept it, and many of these friends gather in somebody\u2019s house, and they always send me a card, and they sign their name that they remember me. And I think it\u2019s a wonderful feeling, to -- to know that these years were so important. I later became a -- a Girl Scout leader. I was pretty good at it. I was leader taking Girl Scouts camping in service areas that we called -- Greece had earthquakes, and the senior Girl Scouts, above -- above age sic -- 17, I think, or 18, would go and help the village, and the people after the earthquakes, and I was the leader there. So they were wonderful years. I just love them."

And it has been an extremely wonderful experience being in that school. Very strict school. Academically very high standards. That\u2019s where I learned English. I had wonderful teachers, that they were not only teachers, but very caring for the children. And I still see them when I go to Greece. They\u2019re in their 90\u2019s. One of them died last year, and she was 103, and I used to go and visit her.

So it gives me such a good feeling to be rooted again, talking to my teachers, talking to my old friends, the people who knew me. They knew who I was, and what I was, and how I was.

            "answer": "No, what I did, I finished high school, and then I went to a school of social work in -- which was part of the American college, it\u2019s called Pierce College. And it was what they used to call apple division. So there were three schools, school -- school of commerce, social work, and literature, so -- so I chose the school of social work. Before that I had become a volunteer Red Cross nurse, and I used to -- I mean, I had six months training, and then I had to be at the hospital for two months every year, taking different shifts, and I enjoyed being a nurse, volunteer nurse, but it was great. So -- I keep on jumping -- so after I became a social worker, I worked -- at the time I was doing academic work, I also had field placements in different places. One was in a community place with refugees, the other was in a -- in an adoption center. It was a place called Mittera, and there were primarily children from unwed mothers, and many of their children were being adopted [indecipherable] with American families, or other families. So I was the social worker trainee. And that -- that was a great place, I liked that place a lot. I tried to convince my parents to adopt a baby from there, but it didn\u2019t work. And after that, you had to pass exams again, because all social workers were employed basically by the ministry of social welfare. So there were a lot of people who were welfare workers, and were going to villages, distributing welfare checks, and taking care of these type of things. There were social workers who were working in a hospital, sort -- other kind of agencies, there were no private agencies that would hire social workers. So I worked in a -- in a hospital at the beginning at the children\u2019s hospital, and later in a public hospital as a discharge social worker, discharging people, and making arrangements for them. And then I met Isaac. Oh, before I met Isaac I also belonged to a little Jewish club. It was a Jewish youth club where I met Sam. Sam is Isaac\u2019s brother. And we became very good friends, both with Sam and his then fianc\u00e9e, Evelyn. And we were a group of about, you know, we were groups, several groups. We used to go on excursions, or places, different -- to the movies together, but we moved in the group. So I was dating at the time a young man, who was part of that Jewish club, and this was a nice time. I think the adults were very pleased that we had this club, and I think partially they financed it, because they wanted all the young people to meet other Jewish people. And in some cases it worked very well, because quite a few of these people married, you know, other women, men, that belonged to this club, and that\u2019s how they met."

But then I think a couple of days later, my sister had some friends over, and this friend of hers said, \u201cWe cannot come, because we have a guest, my cousin from the United States is here, so I cannot come to dinner.\u201d And Yola said, \u201cBring him over,\u201d you know, \u201cit will be fine.\u201d So I was invited, and my parents were invited also, to Yola\u2019s, but my parents were not feeling well, so they didn\u2019t go, so I went.

And I had bought two tickets for Isaac Stern, there was a recital in Athens. And I was still kind of lamenting the fact that I would have to either sell the ticket or go by myself. So after I met Isaac at my sister\u2019s house, and we talked about all sorts of things, and he was telling me about his interest in music, I thought about asking him to come, but girls didn\u2019t ask boys out those days. And I wasn\u2019t sure whether I should do it or not. Anyway, I thought about it, I went to work in the hospital, and I thought about it, and thought about it, and I said, \u201cWell, what difference does it make?\u201d I want him to come. So I called him, and I said, \u201cListen, I have an extra ticket for Isaac Stern, are you interested?\u201d And he said, \u201cI -- am I interested. I would love to go.\u201d So that\u2019s how it happened, I met him, and we went to the theater, we listened to Isaac Stern. During intermission Isaac tells me that he knows Isaac Stern from his college years, where he was directing the concerts at the University of Illinois, and he would like to go and talk to him. So he left me there, and he went backstage. And of course, when he came back, I asked him if he remembered him. Yes, he remembered him, I think. Anyway, we went out after the concert, we had coffee, we had ice cream, whatever. And then the next day, either he called me, or I called him, and I think it was very shortly after, I think I saw him for the whole week. He said to me, \u201cDo you know, in English, when somebody says I want to talk to you, do you know what it means?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, it means that somebody wants to talk to you.\u201d Well, he said -- so he was trying to explain to me what it meant, but all of a sudden he says, \u201cI would like to ask you to marry me.\u201d And I was ah, what? You know, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. But he -- he asked me, and I said, \u201cYes, yes, I will.\u201d Right away. I didn\u2019t even think about it. I was very attracted to him, and I thought he was extremely bright, he was very knowledgeable. He had a great knowledge of music, which impressed me very much.

And maybe my parents felt that way, too, because they knew Sam. Sam worked with my father at the Jewish Central Committee. And he had high respect for Sam, and Sam for my father. So, I mean, he probably thought, who is this guy who is gonna take my daughter to America, you know, to the United States?

A-Also let me tell you that since we got engaged, I would receive huge bouquets of flower every single day, to the point that we had no place to put them, because you know -- and there was always a note from Isaac, you know, with every delivery of flowers. And that was very nice. So to get back to your question, when did we make plans. I think it was understood that I would come to United States. At that time, I was applying for a scholarship to come to the United States to study. And I had applied to Barnard College, and I forget what else. But I had a couple of colleges. And Isaac told me that if I come as a student, I cannot stay in the United States. So we went to the American consulate to get some advice, and they told us that indeed, I could not -- I could get the scholarship, but I -- even -- I couldn\u2019t get married in the United States and remain in the United States. The Greek visa was oversubscribed. So I think 1t was something like 10 years of waiting, or something like that, which didn\u2019t thrill me. And one of the suggestions was that maybe I can go to Canada, and get married in Canada, and then for Isaac to apply for me to come from Canada to the United States as a spouse. Because Canada had no -- no quota. So we thought about it, and thought about it, a-and we thought it might be a good idea. My -- there was a family that we knew who had gone to Montreal. This was my brother-in-law\u2019s- Yola\u2019s husband\u2019s cousin. And they had moved from Athens to Montreal like maybe two years before that. So Freddie, my brother-in-law, wrote to them and told them the situation, and asked them if I could stay with them while all the paperwork was being done. And they said they would be very glad to have me there. So that\u2019s what happened. A friend my sister\u2019s, who was working for HIAS, the Hebrew Immigration Society, said to me, \u201cYou know we are going to speed things up for you. Why don\u2019t you get your police report, your health records, and everything else you need, and we\u2019|l send them to the consulate in Montreal. So after you marry, the -- all your -- all that your husband has to do,\u201d-- [indecipherable], \u201call that your husband has to do is to -- to apply for you to come to United States, and this will save you a lot of paperwork over there.\u201d I said fine. So I did all this preliminary work, and Linda sent everything to Montreal. So I left in April of \u201958 for Montreal. It was -- didn\u2019t hit me until I was on the plane, and I said to myself, where am I going, all by myself, to somebody I don\u2019t really know. I just wanted the plane to come back. But the plane kept going. And eventually I re -- I reached Montreal, my friends were there to greet me at the airport. And this was a family that they had two children, a six year old, and a baby. And I shared a room with the six year old, and also the mother -- his mother lived with them, in a small apartment in Montreal. So Isaac came I think the next weekend, or two weekends later to see me."

I was all dressed up, not in a wedding gown, but in a very fancy, elegant dress that\u2019s -- my parents made me at a very great attag -- couturier, as we used to call it, in Athens. And the question was, do I wear a hat, or do I not wear a hat. And Isaac said, \u201cIf you wear a hat, I\u2019m not going to marry you.\u201d So he doesn\u2019t like hats, or he didn\u2019t like me wearing a hat. So I thought well, okay.

So we -- they told us that we can go out 1n the waiting room and ask two people to come inside and become our witnesses, or go to Eton, we -- which the department store across the street, and [indecipherable] everybody will come, you\u2019re two young people in love, you know, people love stories like this. Anyway, at the waiting room there was another couple. It was an older couple -- I mean, older, I would think probably in their 50\u2019s. And they were going to get married also. So we made an agreement, we would sign -- we would be witnesses at their wedding, and they would be the witnesses in our wedding. And that\u2019s what happened. I had to repeat in English, and my English wasn\u2019t that good at the time, you know, that\u2019s -- I do marry him, and take care of him, for better or worse. And that was it. At the time -- the more I think about that now, the more I think how I missed my family not being there, and not having anybody. And many times I go to weddings, and I cry my heart out. And I wanted my daughters to have nice weddings, with lots of people, and friends, and family. Because I feel that I just -- was a big loss for me not to have anybody. But on the other hand, at the time, I -- all I wanted was to get married to Isaac. And to me, that was because there were a few obstacles, as I said, to -- to bypass the immigration laws, to -- to come -- I mean to -- for him to get the divorce papers, and all this kind of stuff. So these were like little setbacks that kept me wondering would I ever be able to marry this man. And that\u2019s all I wanted at the time, but there was some feeling of not having the people that mattered most in something so important in my life."

            "answer": "Well, okay -- well, so we got married, then we went to Niagara Falls, this was our honeymoon. And -- okay, so we went for our honeymoon to Niagara Falls, we stayed about a week, and then Isaac returned to the United States, and I returned to Montreal. I wasn\u2019t happy at all. The family I lived with, as I told you, had two children, so in order for me to be busy and think less of Isaac, Sonia gave me full care of the baby. He was about six or seven months old, little Eddie. So she would say to me, \u201cYou need to practice, you take care of him.\u201d And I would say, \u201cWell, P\u2019ve never take care of a baby, what do I do?\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out. Just don\u2019t let him fall.\u201d And I was taking care of him completely. I would take him for walks, I would take him out. We\u2019d play together. It was wonderful to -- to have a little baby there. Anyway, meantime -- it takes a long time -- Isaac applied for me to come to the United States as a spouse. And at some point he said to me, \u201cYou know, you have to go to the consulate and tell them that - find out why is it taking so long.\u201d Well, it was taking longer than we thought, and eventually I went to the HIAS office, to the Hebrew Immigration Society, and saw a social worker there, who got interested in the whole thing, and she made several attempts to find out what was going on, and I think eventually what happened is Isaac had applied for me to come to the United States by the name of Nehama, as his spouse. The papers that were sent from Greece, by HIAS were under the name Moudzoukos. So the two things were never put together, Moudzoukos and Nehama were two different persons for them. So they never figured it out. It was only after desperation that Isaac went to his congressman in New Jersey where he lived, and talked to him, and the next day I get a phone call from this social worker, and she said, \u201cGuess what? You\u2019re going tomorrow. We have everything ready for you, the visa is ready, come to the office.\u201d And of course, it was wonderful, because it had become to be a big, big problem, you know, six months- it was six months it took for me being by myself there -- I mean, it wasn\u2019t by myself, but still, I was very anxious to start my life, and for Isaac to be in the United States. So, in November, first day 1t snowed in Canada when I was there, I said good-bye to my friends, and boarded a plane, and came here, in New York, and of course, Isaac was a -- waiting, and he already had rented a house in Lake Hiawatha, which at this time I couldn\u2019t even say the word Hiawatha. And I would think, my God, if I get lost, how am I gonna say where I live? I mean, this is not the place to take me. You should take me someplace where I can pronounce, or I can even say it. So it was -- the house was all taken care of. I mean, he had arranged it, and fixed it, and he had a lot of his furniture there, but decorated very nicely, painted it, just took good care of things. And then it was, how do I live here, and what do I do, and it was a bit hard. It was lonely, because I didn\u2019t know anybody, although I met two good friends of his, and their wives were marvelous. They would come and pick me up and take me to lunch, or take me places, and they tried very hard to -- to make me feel comfortable. But a couple of months later, I -- oh no, I started going to New York, I would take the bus from New Jersey and go to New York in the day time, and started going to the museums, and just getting a feel of the city, and I loved it. And one day, I think Isaac had gone to San Francisco on business, I was looking in the newspaper, and I saw that there was a position open for a social worker that -- to deal with adoptions. So I called, and made an appointment, and took the bus, and went to -- and indeed, it was the International Social Service in New York, that was looking for a social worker, take care of Greek adoptions. I knew all the social workers in the International Social Service in Greece -- I no -- in Athens. I knew them very well. And to me this was like a glove that fitted perfectly well. So I told them I was interested in the job, they said they thought I would be perfect for the job, but they have to communicate with the people in Athens, and get references from there, and everything else, which they did, and then they called me, and they said, \u201cMy goodness, I mean we never heard anything as good as this. When can you start?\u201d So I got the job, and I had to commute, of course, every day from New Jersey. It would take me like an hour almost, on the bus. And it was very exciting, I was very excite -- I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but it was very exciting. And I liked the people work there, very well, very much. Then I got pregnant with Sarah, and commuting wasn\u2019t the best thing for me. I had the threatening miscarriage, and the doctor said to me, \u201cWell, all I can tell you is, what you want, the baby or the wor -- the job?\u201d So I decided I wanted the baby, and that meant I had to stop working. There was no other way to get to New York early in the morning, so I stopped working. And I was sad about that, because I just felt I had reached the point where now I\u2019m able to -- to live in the United States, to work, to become part of it. So it was a bit sad. But of course, having a baby was wonderful."

            "question": "Yeah, you should -- you should tell the story.",
            "answer": "Tell the story. Well, it was a Saturday, thank God, so Isaac was home. Now, my neighbors had told me that if I go to labor, I would call them, and they would take care of the older girls. So when I woke up in the morning, the water broke, and I found out I -- I had contractions, so I-I timed them, and they were about 10 minutes apart. So I woke Isaac up, and said to him, you know, \u201cTake care of the kids. Just give them breakfast or whatever, and I\u2019ll go take a shower.\u201d Actually, I did call my doctor, and told him that I was in labor. And he said, \u201cOh, 10 minutes, okay. When the contractions are,\u201d -- this was like early in the morning, like eight o\u2019clock, or maybe earlier. \u201cWhen the contractions are about five minutes apart, come to the hospital.\u201d And I thought, five minutes apart, that\u2019s a little too -- too close, but I didn\u2019t say anything, he was the doctor. So I went to the bathroom to take a shower, and I had some very strong contractions, so I said, I better lie down. I don\u2019t think I should take a shower. So I lay down, and then things started happening very, very fast. I mean, there were no five minute contractions between the 10 minutes. And I\u2019m feeling the baby is coming, and you know, what can I do? I can\u2019t make it to the bathroom, I can\u2019t -- so I called Isaac, and I said to him, \u201cThrow me a towel, I\u2019m having a baby.\u201d So Isaac took the towel -- I had taken a shower at ni -- the night before, and threw me the towel -- gave me the towel, and he was in a total panic. So he looks out of the window, and he sees my neighbor and good friend, and psychiatrist, Dr. Julius Hoffman walking his dog, and reading his paper. So he opens the door, and he calls Dr. Hoffman, and he said, \u201cJules, Jules, Paulette is having a baby, what do I do?\u201d So he run to his house, which was next door, left the dog, came in -- I don\u2019t know if he washed his hands, but came in and the moment he came in, the baby was halfway out. So he delivered the baby, and he told me it was a girl. I heard her cry once. And Isaac called an ambulance -- oh no, he called the doctor, the doctor said, \u201cMy goodness,\u201d you know, \u201cwhen did that happen? Bring her to the hospital. Call an -- an ambulance and bring to the hospital immediately, I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d So meantime, when Dr. Hoffman took his dog back, he told his wife, \u201cPaulette is having a baby.\u201d So she was alerted, and she came. And I had called another neighbor, who had told me she would take care of the girls, and when I said to her, you know, \u201cI-I\u2019m in labor, and I\u2019Il go to the hospital, do you think you can take care of Sarah and Maya?\u201d She said, \u201cSure, but how close are you, because I can hear you breathing very hard.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, I -- you have plenty of time.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m giving my children breakfast, do I have time?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, you do, come afterwards.\u201d Well, she was here very fast, because she said she had a feeling she couldn\u2019t wait for the children to have breakfast. So the two women are here, and Dr. Hoffman, and the ambulance came. The -- of course, you know, they check the baby, and me. They put me on the ambulance. And as we are going out the door, all of a sudden I said, \u201cWhat happened to Sarah and Maya? Tell them to come here and see their new sister.\u201d Isaac had forgotten about them. He shoved them in her room, and she -- he said to him, \u201cStay there, and don\u2019t move.\u201d So when he opened the door to see the two, to tell them to come out, both of them were huddled one next to the other, sucking their thumbs, poor things. I mean, they were -- so m -- I asked to see them, so they came as I was going out the door on the stretcher. I told them I was fine, and they looked at the baby. And I told them that my neighbors, Mrs. Hoffman, and Mrs. Grossman\u2019s going to take care of them. Daddy would be back, I\u2019d be back in a couple of days, and I'll talk to them on the phone. So off we go, an -- in the ambulance, and I don\u2019t hear the baby crying, so I think she\u2019s dead. I was very worried. So I kept telling Dr. Hoffman, \u201cI can\u2019t hear the baby cry.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou want me to pinch her? She will cry.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t do that, but is she alive, or is she not?\u201d \u201cYes, she\u2019s alive, she\u2019s breathing all right.\u201d So I go to the hospital, the doctor meets me right there at the entrance, he takes me down [indecipherable] emergency room. He checks me out, he says, \u201cMrs. Nehama, you are 1n perfect health. It\u2019s Mr. Nehama who needs to be hospitalized.\u201d Isaac was in the ambulance with Dr. Hoffman, and he was holding the baby, wrapped in a yellow sha -- the yellow towel. We have that towel, I gave it to Nicole. But then I couldn\u2019t see the baby, because they put her in isolation, in the intensive care, just to check her out. And I thought she was dead. So I keep asking, \u201cWhere 1s my baby, where is the baby?\u201d They said, \u201cShe is fine, she is fine.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to see the baby. I want to get up to see the baby.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t let me get up, although I was fine. Well, finally in the afternoon they let me get up, and I went by the nursery and there\u2019s a woman who is sitting there -- standing there in front of the big window, and she said to me, \u201cDid you have a baby today?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, how about you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cI had it at home.\u201d I said, \u201cI did, too. Have you seen your baby?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think my baby\u2019s over there.\u201d And then I looked, and the nurse brought Nicole, or I pointed, and she brought her, you know, from the window, and somebod -- then in the evening I had her, and she came to the room, they brought her. But it was a little worrisome, not being able to see her. So those days you stayed in the hospital about five days. So everything went well, thank God she was fine. Last day of discharge the doctor got us, all the women, all his patients were about to be discharged, and he gives them instructions what to do, and what not to do. So he introduces every single woman around this -- around the room, and he said, \u201cAnd this is Mrs. Nehama, who sneezed and had her baby on Saturday.\u201d He used to call me the do-it-yourself girl. He was funny. But then I heard all sorts of stories. I was at the grocery store one day, and I wrote a check, and the cashier said to me, \u201cThank you, Mrs. Nehama.\u201d And the woman behind me, she said, \u201cAre you Mrs. Nehama?\u201d\u2019 I looked at her, I didn\u2019t know her. I said yes. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re the woman who scared my husband to death.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know your husband, who is he?\u201d Well, she says, \u201cYou don\u2019t know him, but you scared him to death.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d She said, \u201cDi -- didn\u2019t you have your baby at home?\u201d I said yeah. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you had the baby, I was seven months pregnant, and my husband wouldn\u2019t let me get out of the house for two months. He would call me every half hour. He was so scared I would have the baby in the house. You changed my life.\u201d So, there were funny things."

You see, when I came out of the Holocaust, I was sort of afraid to be identified as Jewish, and to -- for people to think that I was Jewish, I wasn\u2019t sure how it would play, so out of my own anxiety, I didn\u2019t really pursue for them to go -- for us to be members of a synagogue, or to be identified with Jewish causes at the time. Now I regret that. I hoped -- o-or I wished that things were different, and my attitude would have been different. And -- but it\u2019s a little too late, I mean, for me anyway, to teach them. But certainly they did get some religious things from -- celebrating the holidays here, the high holidays, and things like that. On high holidays we would go to the synagogue. But I don\u2019t think 1t was enough, I really don\u2019t. But I had areal fear at the time, of being identified a Jew, although I knew it was almost like being a kryptal Jew, because I would never deny that I was Jewish, or -- or I was married to a Jew, but there was a lot of anxiety about that, until I finally realized the Nazis are gone, you know, you have nothing to be afraid of at this point."

            "answer": "Yeah, my daughter Maya was a swimmer, and she used to belong to the swimming team -- swim team of the Jewish social -- I\u2019m sorry, Jewish Community Center in Rockville, in Maryland. So she used to practice on a regular basis, and also they had races, like they had events, they would go to other Jewish centers for -- to compete. So every time there was a race, the -- they would get a badge, and it was be sewn in the back of their jacket, or their sleeves, or t- Maya had quite a few things on her jacket, and she was very proud of it, and I was very proud of her, because she was a good swimmer. And I remember once, after I had sewn a badge on her- most of these badges would say Jewish Federation, or Jewish this, or Jewish that. They had the Star of David. So they were definitely very Jewish badges. She was going to go out with a friend to the mall to buy a present for another friend who had a birthday. So the mother of the other friend was going to drive them there, and pick them up. And it was a cool day, and Maya is ready to go, the car is waiting in my driveway, and she\u2019s wearing this jacket. And I said to her, \u201cMaya, you cannot wear this jacket.\u201d It was full of badges. And she said, \u201cWhy? It\u2019s cold out.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, Maya, you have to put a different jacket.\u201d And I literally sta -- stood in front of the door, because I wanted her to go change her jacket. My feeling was that how can she go to a public place, and be seen as being a Jew? I had this feeling that she would be lynched, that people will say horrible things, that people will do harm to her. And that was unbearable to me, that my child will be hurt because she was Jewish. But basically, what that was saying 1s, I was Jewish, and I was hurt because of that, when I was a kid. So that was very difficult. Of course, once I realized what I was doing, I let her go. But she could not understand it at the time. I explained to her later, when she came back. But I remember s -- having this fear. I actually saw her being hurt. And that was unbearable."

I was talking with my grandson Max, who 1s six, and he was coming here because Isaac was being honored by the Holocaust Museum to light a candle.

And Ian and Maya came. And I was asking Max why is he here, what -- what he\u2019s going to see or hear, or why did he come. And he said to me, \u201cWell, because I know that Grandpa was with the partisans, and he had a gun, and he fought the Nazis, and I know that you were hiding in an attic.\u201d Now how did he get the attic I\u2019m not sure, but -- because I was never in an attic. I was in small rooms, but not in an attic. \u201cAnd -- and some people really hid you, and you couldn\u2019t go out, you couldn\u2019t go to school, and that must have been real nice.\u201d He really liked the fact I didn\u2019t go to school.

The fact that the place is so diverse also is -- to me, it\u2019s very interesting, and very nice. But it\u2019s mostly the personal freedom, of being able to say you\u2019re Jewish for instance, you know, which sometimes I couldn\u2019t say it in Greece, although there were no people to hurt me, you know, this kind of thing. Or to do things. Sometimes we take this freedom a little too far, I think, but there\u2019s no other country, I think, that\u2019s -- freedom is the most wonderful thing to have, and you can find it here. Also there\u2019s another thing. You have opportunities in this country, and if you are willing to work hard, you can do things. Like for instance, I went to get my Master\u2019s degree when I was 49 years old. And I remember discussing this with a friend, and I said, \u201cWell, you know, I have grown-up children, they\u2019Il be going to college pretty soon. I\u2019m 49. I don\u2019t know if I can manage to -- to go get a Master\u2019s degree, and he said -- she said to me, \u201cPaulette, if you want to get a Master\u2019s degree, go get a Master\u2019s degree. You\u2019re going to be 49 whether you get it or not.\u201d And I never forgot that. And I thought, if I lived in Greece, and I was 49, there wouldn\u2019t have been a place for me to go and get a degree, even if I wanted to. Even when I was talking to my friends in Greece, and I would tell them I\u2019m going to college to get a Master\u2019s degree, they would think I was sort of well, maybe she\u2019s a little cuckoo at this late age, you know.

And that was about it. Then the next day I get a call from this friend. She said to me, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you yesterday, but you\u2019re going to receive a telephone call from Many Pavella.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you yesterday, because I wasn\u2019t sure it was her, but I know the woman. We work together.\u201d And she apparently called her, and ask her if they were hiding a family by the name of Moudzoukos. And she said, \u201cYes, we were hiding them.\u201d And she said, \u201cDo you remember Paulette?\u201d And she said, \u201cPaulette, Paulette? No, that was Paulexani.\u201d That was my name, my false name. And anyway, she was very excited that I was in Greece, and wanted to talk to me, and see me. But my friend, you see, didn\u2019t want to disappoint me if this didn\u2019t pan out, if -- you know, it wasn\u2019t the same person. And so the next day I got a call from Many, who was just ecstatic, she was very happy. She wanted to see me, and she wants me to go to the house. Unfortunately she was leaving for -- she was going to be out of the country, and by the time she would have returned, I was leaving for the United States. But we kept in touch by corresponding, I sent her pictures. And then the next year I went to Greece, my sister and I went to visit her. We got in touch with them, and we visited them. And then in \u201997, I believe, or \u201998, Many came to the United States. She apparently studied in the United States, and I had no idea she was in this country, she went to Purdue University, and I had no idea where she was. And anyway, she was being honored by Purdue, so then she decided to make a tour around the United States, and see some of her friends, and when she found out we lived in Washington, of course I insisted that she comes and stays with us. So she came and stayed for a few days. And it was wonderful. We remembered all the past stories, and you know, our parents and everything else."

But she was the only one who knew we were Jewish. The children, the other two, Booly and Dimitris did not, because of their age. So she was worried, of course, about you know, when we left in such a hurry. And they were told that we went with some relatives or something, not clear answers, you know. So there were so many questions, because you wouldn\u2019t get straight answers from adults. I think at my age anyway, and the younger a -- the younger children, Booly and -- and Dimitris\u2019s age. Because I think people were afraid that, you know, children go to school, talk -- I mean they went to school, I didn\u2019t. They talk to friends, if a friend repeats something like this to a parent, and the parent is suspicious, and then, you know how it goes. I mean, you had to be careful."

And then when I pulled myself together, well the doctor explained to me I wasn\u2019t going to die from it, I got all the information I could possibly get. And I couldn\u2019t stop reading books about cancer. That was all I read, because the more I got, the better 1t was for me to ease my anxiety, although some of these books were telling you just horror stories about all what can happen, and it may have not been my situation, but you know, predicting that if this is this, that\u2019s what happens.

They were very equal in their thing, and it was really a wonderful thing to have that, because it honored both families. And obviously David\u2019s family, you know, felt that there should be an Episcopalian marriage, and we felt that 1t should be a Jewish wedding, but we didn\u2019t want this thing to become a -- a problem for them. So they handled it very nicely, very nicely. But I remember passing that church often, and saying to myself, how would I feel when my daughter gets married here? And then I decided that I had to visit the church. I had to go inside, and sit inside, and get the feel of it before the wedding. Because I didn\u2019t want to be breaking down on the day of the wedding. And I did that a couple of times. I went and sat. And I became very comfortable. It was fine. And this is a very good marriage for them. He is a wonderful guy, great husband, wonderful father. So I have no reservations whatsoever. And I remember, 1-it was the first year they were married, and it was Christmas, and they were coming here, and Maya said, \u201cCan we have a turkey?\u201d Because Christmas was always such a big thing for David. You know, it was the first time he was away from his family, to a new country. I mean, things were difficult for him as well, and I 1mi -- immediately, you know, empathized with him, because I came from a different country, and I was in a different place, no ma -- no matter how much you love your spouse, it\u2019s still something you miss. And of course I made the turkey, and -- and he was so happy. He 1s a great guy. And my other fellow, my Mike, Nicole\u2019s husband. Nicole\u2019s si -- Mike is Jewish. He is terrific.

And I had missed Greece. I missed the blue skies, and the blue sea. And I missed my family. The great sorrow was my mother\u2019s death, my father\u2019s death. And certainly, having gone through the Holocaust is a great loss, but it\u2019s also a strength that you gain as a child, or as an adult, because you went through horrible things, and you know that you can survive things. You can live through many difficulties. And I\u2019m a very patient person, and persevere. But life is worth living. Life is wonderful.

When Maya announced that she -- Maya and David came here, and they told us they were expecting a baby, I was sitting on this chair, and I jumped up to the ceiling from joy. I was so happy.

I mean, I could have had it last year, two years ago, five years ago. Why now? It was just terrible.

We didn\u2019t know it was going to be a boy, and it was going to be a -- but, I was thinking of this grandchild constantly, and I wanted to be well, both for my daughter, and my grandson. And I remember Isaac said something very nice. Shortly after the diagnosis, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand, why is this happening now, that I\u2019m going to become a grandmother? I want to live to see my grandchild.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou will live to see this grandchild, and many more to come.\u201d And that was such a nice thing to say. I remember when I was doing -- I was in radiation therapy, and it was very close to Maya\u2019s delivery, I would s -- asked the rad -- the -- the doctor there, the radiologist, \u201cCan I take time off when my daughter has her baby?\u201d And for the moment she thought it was an out of town daughter, so she would say to me, \u201cI can\u2019t let you stop radiation. It doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to be here every single day except the weekend. If your daughter has the baby the weekend, you\u2019re gonna be lucky.\u201d So finally I told her that my daughter lived here, and I had to be there. And she said to me, \u201cWe will make every effort. We will schedule you for six o\u2019clock in the morning. We will schedule you for 10 o\u2019clock at night. Whatever suits you, to help you out, so you can go see your grandchild.\u201d But he was born the day after I finished radiation. I think he timed it very well. I was free, I was happy. I wasn\u2019t radiating anything. And it was just great, was the greatest day."

So my friends date from the Girl Scout days, from high school. And I have two wonderful teachers that are probably in their late 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s that I see. And every time I see them, it\u2019s such a warm reception. Last year I was in Greece, and they invited me to have coffee at a little coffee shop, two of them and a- another good friend, who was also in the same school I was, but she was also in the Girl Scouts with me. So actually she\u2019s the first one I call when I go to Greece. And we were talking about all sorts of things, and then I said to them, \u201cHow do you remember me from my school days?\u201d You know, I was 15 - 16. And it was such a warm feeling for them to talk about me, that they thought I was a very sensitive child. I -- I had a lot of humanity, one of them said it. And that this was very apparent. They both knew I had survived the Holocaust. Although I wasn\u2019t terribly good student, I was good student in some of the -- in their class I was a good student. One taught -- taught history, and the other taught psychology. So I was very good in both classes. I wasn\u2019t good in math. So, I mean such encouragement that I was really a worthwhile person when I was there. And I kind of needed that, to hear it, that what was then, what is now. Because sometimes there\u2019s such a big gap between this ocean. And then the one who is a historian, she sent me a Christmas card, and she said how happy she was to see me in Greece, and that she always remembers me with great affection. And that what she remembers is, here again, my humanity, and she wishes my grandchildren have some of that, and that\u2019s the best wish she can give me, which I think it\u2019s very nice."

Another vignette at that house -- that was the second house we were hiding, in Kipserly. My sister and I were sharing a room, it was actually a big room, and was divided as I said, with a screen. My parents were on one side, and my sister and I on the other. My sister used to tell me about a boyfriend she had. She was 10 years older, so she had a boyfriend, and she loved him dearly, and of course, she couldn\u2019t see him. And she was telling me how much she missed him, and these kind of things. So one day I saw the corner, there was a -- a florist, somebody who was selling violets, actually, not a florist, he was selling violets. So I had a little bit of money my father had given me just to keep it, just to -- to make me happy. I couldn\u2019t use it anyway, since I wasn\u2019t going out, but once again I went out to the corner, and bought her a little bouquet of violets and brought them to her. And to me this was something to tell her that don\u2019t be so sad, you know, that here are some violets. And I remember she was very, very happy about that. She wasn\u2019t happy I left the house to go and do these kind of things, but it was something I remember with great fondness. Unfortunate, she doesn\u2019t remember it now.

We had to go to the grocery store, and depending who -- the number of people in the family, they would give us a certain amount of food.

I mean, I started car -- crying and sobbing, and nobody could understand what happened. My mother thought a bee stung me, or you know, something happened. And I just couldn\u2019t stop crying. So finally I remember the woman who was hiding us saying to my mother, \u201cWhat happened to this child? I mean, she never cries.\u201d And my mother said, \u201cWell, maybe she has gone through a lot, and that\u2019s as much as she can take.\u201d So -- but I was always keeping things inside, and not expressing too much. First of all, I was told not to talk much, because they didn\u2019t know to whom I was going to talk, and what I was going to say. So this was instilled in me, and I understood it, that I shouldn\u2019t talk much. And this carried on, also, past my hiding years, because many times I remember I was always observant, but I wouldn\u2019t talk much. And people would say, well is she here, is she participating, or what? So, it has carried to many, many years, yeah, even now sometimes. I mean, I may be in a group of people, and I may have my own thoughts, but Ill be the last one to express them. If I\u2019m asked specifically, I will. But I wouldn\u2019t jump in."

He had some gold coins, gold pounds sewn around his waistband, and that\u2019s why they brought him back, but they -- they warned us that we had to leave within an hour, or two hours at most, because they couldn\u2019t guarantee anything. When my father was gone, my si -- mother and my sister decided to notify this friend, this general, and my sister jumped over the terrace, to the next house, who was a -- also a family friend, a judge. He was a judge, I believe he was in the Supreme Court, but I\u2019m not sure. So he notified them, and from there they called this general, who came to -- there was a market, a big market near the house we were staying in Kipserly, and he went to that market, so he could see the house. So he was pretending to look at the eggs, and to make sure the eggs were okay, you know you usually look at them in the sun to see whether they are rotten or not. And -- so he was pretending to look at eggs, and so he could see whether there was anybody coming or going in the house. The moment he saw they brought my father 1n, and when he saw these guys leave, he came to the house, and he took my father to his house. And then, either he came back for us, or we went back, within -- it wasn\u2019t within walking distance, but we definitely walked it. And then th -- this family found another place for us. We stayed with them I think two nights. There were two children there, and -- a boy and a girl, and the parents."

I remember them both smoking so much, the room was so foggy because of all that smoke. Was one cigarette after the other. Those days we didn\u2019t know much about cigarettes, you know, but it certainly did something for them, because they were so anxious. My mother took -- my father didn\u2019t have much to do, because the man of the house was -- you know, had gone to the base, he was in the Navy, as I said before. And my mother would help with the cooking, or she will do the cooking, the woman will do the shopping. So my mother was a little more busy than my father. Now you asked me before how I would pass my day. I remember my mother tried to teach me how to embroid, and my mother was excellent in embroiding. She has done beautiful pieces, and I have some of her pieces, which I treasure. But I just didn\u2019t have the patience to do that. I mean, I couldn\u2019t sit quiet, and just trying to put a little -- my needle in the little hole there, and get pleasure out of it. It was the most boring thing for me. So I wasn\u2019t particularly interested. And a little bit of knitting was more to my liking. But I wasn\u2019t very good at that too. So these things didn\u2019t really attract me, or just, you know, give me any particular pleasure in doing. So most of it, as I said, I had two books that I\u2019ve read, and then I got ahold of this weekly mag -- I think it was either weekly or monthly children\u2019s magazine, which was called, The Development of Children. But they had some wonderful stories in there. So I read -- some of them were a continuation, you know, so you would wait for the next. I think, now that I think about it, I think Mrs. Padzoupolus would send me this magazine -- the woman whose house we went after they got my father, the general\u2019s house. Somehow her children had it, and then after they would read it, they would -- I don\u2019t know how I got it, because I don\u2019t know whether they mailed it, whether the man of the house would go to their house and get it, I have no idea. But I know that I had it, and it was wonderful, because it was like a four page little newspaper, you know, that I could read from the beginning to the bottom, and it was -- it was good.

And I remember we had a plan in place that should the Germans come, they would certainly come from the front, or -- we could all go to the backyard and jump the fence, and by then we would be to the next block. So by then we could run or do something. How -- we never put that plan in effect, actually we never need it -- needed it. But it gave me comfort that there was something we could do, something concrete that I was involved in, because they -- they told me what to do, and in fact we had a little bundle of a few clothes, you know, that we could take if we had time. But the thing was that we had to leave right away, and jump the fence, and that will take us through the yard of the next people, to the next block. So --"

Now that we\u2019re talking about clothes, there\u2019s something else. After the war was over, and I think it was after the civil war in \u201944, there was help that had come from the United States, you know, in -- relief. And among them, there was what we used to call UNRRA, UN -- United Nations Relief Agency. And they were distributing clothes. So I needed a coat, and my mother took me to get a coat. So we looked through the different bins, or thing, and she came up with a brown coat that was down to my ankles, really long, and I didn\u2019t like it, but it was wool, and it was warm, and she wanted me to have it, because it was winter. I cried, and cried and cried, because I just didn\u2019t like this coat. I wanted something else, but everything else was either too small for me, or too big for me and [indecipherable].

And as they were going up the stairs, there was a mannequin of a child with a blue coat, and she fell in love with that little blue coat. So they talked to the saleslady and they gave her the coupon, and she brought out a very dark looking coat. And the little girl said, \u201cI don\u2019t like this coat, I like that blue one.\u201d And she said, \u201cNo, this is not for you.\u201d And she started crying. Then the manager came, and he said, \u201c\u201cWhy is she crying?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause she wants that coat.\u201d \u201cNow that coat costs a lot of money.

But she had a tremendous warmth, that people 8 remember her. And everybody says, even now, that she was a grand dame, like a lady, a real lady. There\u2019s another vignette that I have to tell you, because that describes her. Many years ago, Yola and I went back to Volos. And we went around the place where our house was, which doesn\u2019t exist any more, has become apartment buildings. And we were walking through the neighborhoods, it was the first time I went back to Volos since I left Volos, since I came to the United States. That was in the -- \u201974 - \u00b075 -- 1974 - \u201975, approximately then. Yola had been to Volos before. And I think there was a lecture also, that we wanted to go. So I was telling Yola that I always remember my mother will take me to a pastry shop called the Swiss. And I always remember the owner there, you know, talking to me, and giving me a little piece of pastry, or a cookie, or something. So Yola says, \u201cWell, we\u2019re gonna go that way anyway, so let\u2019s stop.\u201d So we went, the sign still says the Swiss. And we go in, and the store is the same, nothing has changed, you know, it\u2019s a narrow store, you know, the -- you know, all the pastries, and all the breads there, and it\u2019s a fairly young man, a young man who recognizes Yola and says, \u201cYes, I remember you, you were here before.\u201d He is the son of the owner. And he says, \u201cWell, my father comes here every day. He is 90 years old, and he sits there.\u201d In -- in the corner is this old man, you know, asleep on a chair, and with his cane. And he goes -- [indecipherable] \u201cHere is my sister who lives in the United States.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he says, \u201cI have to tell my father.\u201d So he goes over and he -- he wakes his father up, and he says, \u201cFather, you know who this is?\u201d And he says, \u201cThis is the Moudzoukos daughters. This is Yola, and this is Paulette.\u201d And the man -- for a moment he was trying to wake up. He gets up from the chair, shaking, and he embraces me, and he starts crying. He says, \u201cI remember you. I remember your mother, what a lady she was. I remember bringing you here.\u201d I mean, it was such a moving moment. And then in the evening we went to the lecture, and this woman recognizes Yola, and then she tells me -- Yola says, 9 \u201cThis 1s my sister, Paulette.\u201d Says, \u201cOh Paulette, I was thinking of you a few days before.\u201d She is a photographer, a professional photographer.

I think that\u2019s the 0 relationship, and I remember his grandmother, a nice, wonderful old lady who would always bless me to become a bride, for her to see me a bride. Lovely woman. So, anyway, he has written a book about the Jewish community of Volos, which he send me, and I correspond with him occasionally. Actually, the holidays I sent him a card, he sends me a card. I spoke to him on the phone a couple of times when I was in Greece. When I go to Volos I see him. I think it was in 1975, or \u201974, there was a letter came from the Jewish community, they were going to have a 50 year reunion of the Jewish community of val -- of Volos, of the people who left Volos, because a lot went to the United States, a lot went to Israel, or other parts of Europe, or Athens.

And there are pictures of my father, my grandfathers, the -- my father and grandfather was the president, my gra -- yeah, my grandfather, his father, the president of the Jewish community. So there are prominent, big pictures of them, right on a panel. The factory is very prominently displayed, since he was one of the biggest employers there. And then the connections.

But my father was a fighter, you know, he wasn\u2019t -- a very kind man, very kind man. He couldn\u2019t stand people being hurt. He was a very good employer, and I hear that now from people, that he was an excellent employer. He was also involved in city affairs, I mean he was in the city council, he was in the Jewish community, of course, he was -- he was a pillar of the society."

My father wa -- my mother was always very clean, her house was always very orderly. She had excellent taste. So for her to be at somebody else\u2019s house, it was very difficult. She -- I mean, she 3 had no other choice, you know. And before we went into hiding, during the Italian occupation, when we had lived in the villages of the mountains of Pilion, here again we were renting a room, or two rooms from somebody else\u2019s house. So that was hard for her, too, you know, to be ina village, here is this lady who 1s -- she wasn\u2019t spoiled, I want you to know, I mean, she was -- she was a woman who had a good life, but she wasn\u2019t spoiled. So, you know, these things did take some toll, I think. But I think the hardest thing for her was when we lost the factory, a lot of her - of friends, who at least appeared to be friends during the good times, just disappeared. And that she never forgot, that was a trauma for her, that the friends that she had helped, and friends that she was counting on, and has been to their house, they have been to her house, kind of discarded us because they were not -- they didn\u2019t have money any more, for awhile. So that really traumatized her."

I mean, she would -- those days they used to weigh things, because you know, you have to eat a certain amount of carbohydrates, and a certain amount of 4 protein, I think. But this became her responsibility of taking care of him in this way. And she would weigh everything. I remember he loved cherries, so the season of cherries would come, and they would count like eight cherries on the little plate, and he would say, \u201cWhat is this, eight cherries? Bring the bowl of cherries here.\u201d And she would freak out, say, \u201cBut these are weighted.\u201d You know, so it was like the joke, we weigh things and he -- he would sneak a few other cherries, you know, from the bowl. So yes, but he did count on her support. She was very supportive of him, she was always there for him. I mean, they had a very close relationship. But she begun to get depressed, and I think she had great difficulty overcoming this depression and slowly with every more d -- every difficulty that came along, it was harder for her to come on -- to overcome this. So I guess she slowly started withdrawing, and withdrawing more and more. Then she had -- her appetite was diminished. She also had a problem with saliva, she couldn\u2019t produce enough saliva to chew her food. And I don\u2019t know if this was the result of a dental procedure that she had, or not, I -- I -- I\u2019m not quite clear, I don\u2019t remember, actually, at this point. But she -- she had lost saliva, so she couldn\u2019t chew her food, and it was very painful. And she started losing a tremendous amount of weight.

There were a couple of clients who had big orders, and they cancelled them because they had financial problems and couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t do it. So that, of course, affected our financial situation. So, I think she got 5 tired, and she just didn\u2019t want to fight any more. And I left in *58, so I\u2019m sure that my leaving was something, you know, difficult for her. She always hoped to be able to come and visit me, and see me in my new place.

Sarah was a very feisty baby, very, very light, very small baby, but my goodness. A friend of mine who had her baby with Sarah, we put them both in a playpen.

You\u2019re going to feed your child food from the can, or from a jar? Is that what you do in the United States?

They don\u2019t use it any more, because it\u2019s so powerful. I was in the United States, so I learned it from the unites -- here. And I was not able to go to the funeral, because we lived in California at the time, Sarah was a baby, she was like two years old, I mean she was -- I couldn\u2019t leave her with anybody. And so -- we didn\u2019t have the money also to -- you know, to travel from California to Greece. So, it was -- you know, when I went back in \u201963 with Maya and Sarah, Sarah was three, three and a half, and Maya was one at the time, or before one. She celebrated her first birthday in Greece. That was like a year and a half after my mother had died. Everybody came to the airport, my sister, my father, and my aunts. Friends of mine came, 7 and my friends told me later that they wanted to be there to greet me because they knew that since my mother wasn\u2019t there, they didn\u2019t want me to feel the void, which I did feel the void. But you see, I lived in her house -- actually it wasn\u2019t the same house that I left to come to United States from, because after my mother died, and my father moved to -- to a smaller apartment near my sister. So I\u2019ve never been to this apartment before, but I was still looking for her. So it was like I was grieving for her, two and a half year -- one and a half years later, where everybody was finally coming to terms a little bit with it.

Greece 1s not a -- a place where people, you know, understand these kind of things. Certainly nobody in the family understood the enormity of it. I think she did see a doctor, who maybe put her on antidepressants or something, but that was shortly before she died. So, it was not a long therapy before that. You know, she just didn\u2019t have -- she had lost the -- the zest for life. Everything seemed to be just enormous for her, even if I would say, well, can my friends stay for dinner, and this was a friend she knew, and somebody, you know, she didn\u2019t have to particularly make something special, it seemed like it was too much for her. Or they had to move from one apartment to the other because the lease expired and this man was raising the price. And that was a tremendous thing for her, to -- to have to move again. To -- to pack, to organize. I mean, she had moved many times 1n her life, so things become enormous all of a sudden. I mean, the slightest thing becomes enormous.

And she talks a little bit about the future, like, you know, send me a picture of Sarah or something like that, which is, you know, like looking forward to something, right?

So Isaac came home early, and then he asked me to sit down next to him, and he said, \u201cI have to tell you, Mother died.\u201d And when he said Mother died, I thought he was talking about his mother. And I\u2019m thinking, why 1s he telling me his mother died, she died, you know, in the Holocaust. Why now he tells me this? I know, and I said, \u201cI know.\u201d You know, like I was trying to figure it out. He said, \u201cNo, not my mother, your mother died.\u201d But he -- he said nothing about suicide. He told me that she died, and you know, it was something I just couldn\u2019t grasp, I just couldn\u2019t get in my head. So it took me a couple of days to absorb it. Then I got a letter -- then I called home. And I think it was -- you know, your mind gets kind of blocked in situations like this. Because I called, and it was after the funeral, so I spoke to my father, and my father said, \u201cWe lost Thaliki,\u201d -- Thalia was my 1 mother\u2019s name. Thaliki is like a diminutive.

I didn\u2019t tell him that, but that was the thought that went through my mind. So it was -- it was very differ -- difficult to be that very far away.

Actually I did work in the evenings, when I think Nicole was in kindergarten, for Garfinkels -- part time -- this was my part time job. And it was primarily because I needed to do something, and I needed to do something very part time. But I -- I could start exploring other things. But I always wanted to go back to social work, because this was a field that always interests me. I mean, I\u2019m interested in people, and their lives, and what makes them tick, and what\u2019s -- how they conduct their lives, what\u2019s in their lives, what influence their lives. So, I had a Bachelor\u2019s degree from Greece, from Pierce College, which was an American school. And I knew I couldn\u2019t do very much, but when Nicole went to first grade, I -- I thought 4 seriously of getting a job in social work. And somebody told me about the Jewish Social Service in Rockville, that they were looking for a social worker at the department of aging, I think. And I called, and verified that indeed they did need somebody, asked me to send my resume, which I did, and they called me back, they wanted me to go for an interview, which was terrific. Well, I did go to the interview, but I went a day earlier than the interview was scheduled, like I was not anxious, I guess. And then I realized when I\u2019m there, because the receptionist looks at [indecipherable] says, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have you down for today. I think your interview\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d I\u2019m protesting, I said, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s today at 10 o\u2019clock.\u201d And then I realized I\u2019m wrong, but then I\u2019m thinking if I tell them I\u2019m wrong, they\u2019ll never hire me. So anyway, the assistant director who was to interview me, Marty Moss was his name, he -- he said to me, \u201cI thought this interview was tomorrow, but anyway since you\u2019re here, I have 10 minutes because I have to go into a meeting. Let\u2019s just discuss a few minutes of what is available, and what you can do [indecipherable]. And maybe we\u2019ll have to have a second interview at one time.\u201d Well, he\u2019s telling me that the opening 1s at the Department of Aging in the Jewish Social Service. Now, I know nothing about aging. I\u2019ve never worked with older people, I don\u2019t know what to do with them. I want to work with children. Anyway, I said okay. And then I get a call from the chairperson of the Department of Aging to go for a second interview. And I\u2019m thinking, do I really want to work with older people? I\u2019m not sure. But anyway, it was an entrance. So I think the question that really, she asked me, was -- I had done some volunteer work for the Jewish Community Center, we were doing some kind of a woman\u2019s day, and I had chosen the older women, and I had done, you know, some -- a presentation about it, and gathered material, and we had the show, a -- a fashion show for older women, you know, because we felt they were neglected in the fashion, things like that. Which went very well, actually. And I was telling her 5 about that, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019d be perfect for the department\u2019. And I\u2019m thinking, you don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t either, I don\u2019t know anything. But anyway, they hired me. And I was excited, and I thought well, Pll learn. If I don\u2019t like it, I can always leave. So that was how I started, and once I started working with older people, I just loved it. I found it so rewarding. You know, here I was, always wanted to work with children, and now I\u2019m finding the other end of life more interesting, actually, and very rewarding. So it was great, it was a great team to work with. It was a good a -- very good agency, very good camaraderie and professionalism. And I enjoy every minute of it, and I stayed there. I think I started in \u201974, and stayed until 1990. That\u2019s a long time. And while I was working there -- I always wanted to do therapy, and I had taken some courses, and then while I was at the Jewish Social Service, the -- my department chair said, \u201cPaulette, you've got to get your Master\u2019s degree. You are doing things that Master\u2019s degree social workers are doing, but we can\u2019t pay you as a Master\u2019s degree social worker.\u201d So finally I thought about it, and thought about it, and I\u2019ve never been to an American university, I was 49 years old. So when I told a friend, I said, \u201cI\u2019m 49, how am I gonna go to school?\u201d She said, \u201cYou'll be 49 whether you go or not, just go.\u201d So finally I talked it over with Isaac, I said I would need a lot of help. This was a time that Maya had started driving, and she said, \u201cI'll help, I'll help, I'll do all your [indecipherable] driving for you.\u201d So everybody pitched in and I did go to school. They accepted me as an advanced standing student because of my experience with social work. They waived ce -- certain courses the first semester, and they waived field placement the first semester, because I was still working for the Jewish Social Service part time. So my first year was much lighter than the other students here. Second year was harder, I had to -- to quit working for the Jewish Social Service, because I couldn\u2019t handle everything, because I did have a field placement, and I had an excellent supervisor. It was in a psychiatric clinic, a community 6 psychiatric clinic in Witten. And I got excellent experience, I had a wonderful supervisor, Meedul Shore. And of course I had the classes, you know, I had to go to school, and plus the family. Sarah was already in college, Maya and Nicole were home. So it was hard writing papers, I\u2019ve never written a paper in this country. I mean, I\u2019ve written papers in Greece, but they were different. It was a little hard, because as I said, this was a new experience for me. I didn\u2019t even know how to use the library. I had to ask how to use the library. It was a lot of work, an awful lot of work, but I loved every minute of it, because I felt I was doing it because I wanted to do it. And I graduated with a Master\u2019s in 1991. And I went back to the Jewish Social Service, and -- but at the time they had a part time job only available, and they said, \u201cCome, it\u2019s part time, if something opens as full time, we\u2019ll get you as full time.\u201d"

And while I was working for the Jewish Social Service, my supervisor at the community psychiatric clinic, called me one day, and he said, \u201cYou know, there is a psychiatrist who is looking for a social worker to work for him to do intakes. Are you interested?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m interested, but I\u2019m not leaving Jewish Social Service.\u201d So he says, \u201cT\u2019ll have him call you.\u201d So he calls me, and he says he\u2019s looking for a social worker to do his intakes. Intakes are, you know, you -- you g -- see the person for the first time, you collect all the information, and then you give it to him, and then he determines the treatment and this kind of thing. But it\u2019s an elaborate process, I mean, the interviews have to be quite long, and to understand the problem, and this kind of thing. So when he called me, I was leaving for Arizona the next day. It was one of Isaac\u2019s retreats. So I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m leaving for a week.\u201d He said, 7 \u2018Send me your resume, and then we\u2019ll talk when you come back.\u201d I came back, he said, \u201cCome and see me.\u201d So I went to see him, we -- he decided to hire me. So I was working for him part time, and I stayed with him 11 years. I was working both at the Jewish Social Service, and with him. His name is Aaron Burger, he is in Silver Spring, very nice man. So that was a very good experience, too, because he is a good supervisor also, and a very good -- good friend, also, he became."

But he also gave me some people from -- for treatment, some cases that didn\u2019t require his skills, you know. And then, when I quit Jewish Social Service in 1990, because Isaac was retiring, and I- we were thinking a lot about traveling to Europe and all that kind of stuff, I left Jewish Social Service, and continued working with him for -- until after Ian was born, and then I told him I wanted to spend time with my grandson. And that was it. Which he fully understood, and -- because he has grandchildren of his own. And I\u2019m friends with his wife, and his daughter, we became quite good friends. So --"

They\u2019ve been in business for 20 years. It\u2019s run by two social workers, and they needed a Master\u2019s degree social worker to supervise social workers who do care managers, and do care management. Coordinating services, and seeing families, and this 8 kind of thing. And I\u2019m still with them, very part time, but I love doing it. I mean, I -- I do enjoy my career, my career is just the best career for me, anyway. It\u2019s great. Once I was thinking that I may want to change careers at times, because sometimes people\u2019s problems become too big, and you wonder how good you are at it or not, in helping. But I think this was a phase I had gone through, so I decided to take a catering course, cause I love to cook, and I thought well, maybe Ill do that professionally. But I did take the course, I got the certificate, I enjoyed the course, but I haven\u2019t opened a catering thing. Isaac wasn\u2019t too happy for me to do that."

I understand moving away from a country, and from family, and going to another country and starting to make a life there. I understand loneliness, lonesomeness.

I base that on you having mentioned getting performing artists t-to perform regularly for the elderly.",
            "answer": "Seniors. Yeah, this is volunteer work. I mean, my work for the Aging Network Services is -- is paid work. I\u2019m a member of WPAS, or Washington Performing Arts Society, the women\u2019s committee, and the women\u2019s committee has several subcommittees. And one of the committees I co-chair with another woman, is called Enriching Experiences for Seniors, that started about 10 or 12 years ago. And what we do 1s we bring local artists to senior centers, nursing homes, assisted livings, recreation centers for senior adults. What we do is just we coordinate these things. You have to coordinate the center, find the activities director, the date, coordinate the artist, and the days they are available to do this kind of things. And also provide the volunteers from the women\u2019s committee who go to audit the performance, because this way they give us feedback on the artists and the interaction between the -- all the people and the artists, so we\u2019 ll know whether to hire them for next year or not. This 1s a free program to the community -- I mean, the seniors don\u2019t pay anything for this. WPAS has a budget for the senior program. And that\u2019s what I do in addition to working for the gala, which is a [indecipherable] event, fundraising event, or the auction, or the embassy adoption program, which 1s another women\u2019s committee program, where embassies adopt school, and the -- for the semester, or for the year, and the children study about that particular country. And I usually choose Greece. So the children -- the school that chooses Greece, and the embassy, I\u2019m the liaison between the two of them. So we go -- the representative for the Greek embassy, or the other embassies go to the school, talk to the children about it. The children study about Greece, and work with the teachers, we work with the teachers, and then at the end of the semester, they put up a presentation, the embassy invites them for -- for cookies and juice, or whatever. And they give a presentation to 0 the ambassador, or the staff members of the embassy. And then we take the children to a Greek restaurant, so they can taste a little food. These are sixth graders, they are 12 years old, and they are wonderful. This -- I mean, 50 embassies participate in this -- in this program, and it\u2019s a fantastic program for teachers and children. The teachers love this program because the children learn so much through that program about the other countries. And it\u2019s very educational, it\u2019s a fun program, it\u2019s just great. So I love doing Greece, as you understand. Last year there were -- the Greek embassy was between ambassadors, so they didn\u2019t have time to participate in the program, so they were not there. So I did the embassy of the Bahamas, which was also a nice experience, you know, and I went to a school pretty far away in someplace -- I think it was northeast Washington. And the wife of the ambassador came to the school, they had -- they invited the children to their embassy of the Bahamas. They had the presentation, they provided lunch at the embassy, from the whole class. It was a good experience. I mean, to -- to -- somehow I feel that, you know, just doing Greece every year kind of limits me to other countries, because people tell me wonderful things about the embassy of Israel, you know, and Thailand or other countries. But I love Greece, so Pll do anything to promote Greece, and to -- and teach children about it. There is so much. And next year it\u2019s going to be an important year because of the Olympics, so --"

There was an orphan -- not a Jewish orphanage, an orphanage in Volos, and sometimes she would take me with her. And I loved going with her, and talking with the children there, but I was also petrified that if my mother and father were to die, I would end up in that orphanage. I was so scared of that, of them dying and me being in the orphanage. And I remember when I had this visit in Volos, when it was like the 50 year reunion I was telling you, Yola and I had taken a taxi to go to the Jewish cemetery, because our grandparents are buried there. So as we are passing, the driver -- the taxi driver says, \u201cAnd here 1s, on the left 1s the orphanage.\u201d And I said to him, \u201cStop!\u201d And he scratches on his brakes, and he stops the taxi. And he said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I said, \u201cStop, I want to see this orphanage.\u201d It seemed so small to me. I said, \u201cIs this the same orphanage that was here?\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said, \u201cnothing has changed. They just painted it, but it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d It looked so tiny.

            "question": "-- what happened to the family?",
            "answer": "Okay. As I told you, my parents were first cousins, so my father was the second child, and first son. There were five children in his family. His mother was the eldest of seven children. My grandparents had seven children, two girls. First one, my paternal grandmother, last one my maternal grandmother, and there were boys in between. So there were five children in my father\u2019s family. Abusta was the eldest, my father was the second, there were two girls, and Saould, or Sauld was the youngest, who was born in 19 -- I think he was born 1909, or 1910. So he was like an afterthought. He was much younger compared to the other siblings in the family. Well, none of them are alive. They all went to hiding in different places. My fourth aunt, the fourth child in the family was the only one who survived until 1976, I think. She came to the United States. She was adopted by an uncle, the brother of -- of her mother, who was married, and they couldn\u2019t have any children. So Connie used to go to their house, and they had her there, and they played with her, and they loved her, they absolutely were in love with her. And they decided to come -- to go to Teriester first. So they asked if they could take her along. And they did, and then they decided they wanted to come to the United States. I mean, the uncle, and his wife. So they went back to Greece, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an official adoption, whether there were papers of adoption taken. But somehow it seems like the family, or the parents, anyway, decided to -- to let her go with the uncle, because they felt she will have a wonderful life in the United States, and not in Volos. So she came to the United States, and she didn\u2019t know she was 3 adopted until much, much later in life. She was an adult, I think, when she found out about that. She got married, and had a son, whom I see, Bob Guburbon. My aunt died in, I think, \u201970 -- let me see, no, she must have died in \u201976 or \u201977, yeah, in Florida. And her husband died a few years later. I see her grand -- h-her son, often. This aunt, Connie, send us care packages after the war was over, with food, with clothes. She would send fancy party clothes for me, and they looked so funny, because you know, I mean, here I didn\u2019t have any clothes, and I had a -- an organza dress, old dress. And she would send some cans, I mean, chocolates. And she once sent shoes for my father. I remember they were so huge. I mean, my father was a tall and big man, and these shoes were tremendous for him. I mean, he couldn\u2019t wear them. And she sended a teddy bear for me. So I always remember her, you know, for doing these things. Of course, I met her when I came to the United States. But I mean, she had never met her siblings. She was in touch with them. I don\u2019t know if she was in touch with them before the war, but after the war, I mean, she came through with sending care packages. And then, of course, they were corresponding with -- \u2018scuse me -- with my father, and he was the one who would tell the news, you know, t-to -- to his sisters. And my Aunt Julia corresponded with her, because Julia had come to the United States to visit her son who was studying, and has seen Connie. Now, my father\u2019s younger brother, Saul was hiding in somebody\u2019s house, I think the name was aseema -- Aseemomeetees. And there were two daughters and a son, maybe two sons. And he fell in love with the oldest daughter, and she with him. Saul was a handsome, beautiful man. And after the war was over, they kept on seeing each other, and dating each other, and they wanted to get married, but of course she was Christian Orthodox, and the rabbi wouldn\u2019t marry them, she had to convert. So she took all the lessons that she needed to do to convert. But then there was a little detail which I don\u2019t remember now, and they decided they were gonna go to France, and get married in Paris. So 4 they did go to Paris and got married, and came back to live in Athens. And she knew more about Jewish holidays than any of us did. My mother didn\u2019t know them, and she would call -- Deena, was her name. Deena would call my mother and say, \u201cDo you know that today is,\u201d such and such a holiday. My mother would say, \u201cOh, really?\u201d I mean, we observed the big holidays, but not the little ones. And Deena knew everything. And -- but unfortunately, a few months later, in 1950 -- I think they married \u00b049, or beginning of \u201950 -- or \u201951 I think it was, he got cancer, a brain tumor. And they went to Paris and he had surgery and died. It was terrible. It was devastating. He was 40 or 41, very young. A life, you know, just got done so young. And of course Deena was totally, totally devastated. Now, many years later she remarried, but she divorced, this marriage didn\u2019t go that well. Then many years later she married somebody who was living in the United States, in Florida, so -- a -- a -- a Greek, but I think he -- he was Greek American, or someth like that, and he went -- they -- they lived in Florida. She couldn\u2019t stand it, she didn\u2019t like Florida, she didn\u2019t like America. So she divorced him too, and she went back to Greece, and now she -- she lives alone. When I go to Greece she comes and sees me. She -- she is very warm, very lovely. I went to -- to volunteer nursing school at the Red Cross in Greece with her sister, her younger sister. So we were both volunteer nurses at the Red Cross hospital, and we took the classes together. So I haven\u2019t seen her sister for a long time, but Deena, she was a lovely, lovely woman, yeah."

So he was again like he was a forgotten man, he was somebody special and very much sought after in his younger years, because of his position and his powerful connections and everything else. And then now that he needed to have a lot of people around him, you know, they will come once in awhile to visit, and that was about it. So he -- he was lonely, very lonely."

She took very good care of him, and she was like the care manager, 6 you know, did everything for him. Took -- would visit him every day, will talk to the doctors, make arrangements with doctors, and things like that, yeah. Yeah, she was -- she took excellent care of my parents. And I think she resents it a little bit that I was so far away and could not help, that she had to go through that by herself. And maybe my job of taking care of older people, has something to do at some point with my need to take care of my parents. You know, lots of unconscious things go around. Can\u2019t decipher every single thing, but I\u2019m sure my choice of work is not incidental, you know, it\u2019s medi -- meaningful, and it relates to my need to do something I didn\u2019t do. You know, I mean, they needed care, and she was there for them, I wasn\u2019t."

            "answer": "Well, I think it\u2019s in balance with my life at this point. I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s one experience that I wouldn\u2019t have had if the war had not happened. I think my life would have turned out to be totally different. Carefree, you know, affluent. Totally different life. But I certainly don\u2019t regret my life. I think it was a good life in many ways, because it brought me to the point I am now, close to 70 years of age, where I think I have become a very strong person, a very compassionate person, a person who cares about people. A person who -- who enjoys life. I mean, I remember a friend of mine once, who has a house at the beach, had invited me, and then we decided at the spur of the moment to go to a -- to an orchard, or to -- to a farm nearby, and pick up peaches. And I remember giggling, and just laughing, and enjoying picking peaches. And she looked at me, and she said, \u201cPaulette, I never knew you would get such a thrill out of something so simple, you know, such a very simple kind of thing.\u201d Incidentally, when we were, during the Italian occupation, I used to go and pick up fruit, you know, climb the trees and pick up peaches, or cherries. And of course I would eat the cherries, and I got sick, because I would love them, and 7 you know, then my stomach will hurt. So maybe that reminded me a little bit of that, but it was such a pleasure to do things, to do anything. I mean, I love being outdoors, looking at the blue sky, and -- or watching children, see them grow. That\u2019s the biggest joy for me."
