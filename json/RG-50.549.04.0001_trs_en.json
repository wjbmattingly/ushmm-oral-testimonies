Well, I rem -- first of all, looking at our general family constellation, some of the most interesting and fun thi ngs that -- that we did, meaning Paul and I did as children, was to go and visit our relatives. My mother\u2122s family, each -- she has two older sisters, one sister lived with her family in Vineland , New Jersey, the other sister lived with her family in Toronto, Canada . And travels out of New York City, to different venues are always interesting to any child. What was very unique -- visiting Toronto , of course, is a foreign country, but I don\u2122t think there is anything in Toronto that particularly grabbed our attention when compared to our lives in New York, except that it was always fun to see our cousins and that sort of thing. Going to Vineland was very interesting because at that time, our aunt and her husband, our uncle lived on and owned a ch icken egg farm. And they had dogs and Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 7rabbits and people who worked there. And imagine coming from Washington Heights and then all of a sudden being allowed to play in -- in a wide open farm with your cousins who took you around and showed you all of these things that you\u2122d never been exposed to before. You ha d the run of the land, you had the run of the animals, you had the run of the house. It was really a big adventure. We also had a paternal grandmother, who lived in Asbury Park, New Jersey, very, very close to the beach. So when we visited there it was always pleasant for my mother to take us over to the shore. It was only about four or five blocks directly to the beach, and we could go on the little rides, and -- and get a salt water taffy, and orange-ade, and waffles with ice cream and hang out on the shore, and if the weather is right we could even go in the water. But we could go to the beach any time of the year, as long as it was clement weather. That was always a fun thing to do. My brother and I had free run of the neighborhood i-in Washington Heights, that\u2122s near 190th Street and Fort Washington Avenue. In those days -- and thes e days as well, but in those days it was a very, very safe, and th e children could wander the neighborhood freely, enjoying everything from the Cloisters Museum in Fort Tryon Park, all the way through playing ball in the schoolyard as most children would do.

As a matter of fact, since so many o-of my mother\u2122s relatives, and -- and of course her extended circ le of friends were survivors as well, this was not something that seemed in any way aberrational or different. This was just something that I accepted as the norm, that some of the people in the neighborhood I lived in, in Washington Heights, had come over after World War as survivors, as compared to the many, many other, particularly German Jews who settled along Fort Washington Avenue in the late 1920\u2122s and 1930\u2122s, before the war.

My -- when the war broke out, as my mother was born in December of 1929, and the war broke out in September of 1939, my mother had not even celebrated her 10 th birthday.

For example, my oldest -- my mother\u2122s oldest sister, my oldest aunt, I was just going to say, is just slightly more reticent, but that\u2122s just her -- her -- just innate character. She\u2122s always willing to discuss, and always was willing to discuss their past. She married a survivor, and someone that she had known overseas, of course, and she -- he was a -- he was a guerilla fighter, as was the husband that my mother\u2122s next oldest sister married. They were all survivors, so within the family, issues of discussing their past are certainly -- were n-nothing to hide, this was part of their joint and several backgrounds. And actually, my father would be the only one who would be viewed or -- I shouldn\u2122t he would be -- he could have been, but he wasn\u2122t viewed as an outsider, having been born here in Brooklyn and grown up in New York City . It\u2122s a -- but my father fit right in with the family, he -- he\u2122s just a -- a very gentle and welcoming sort of person and -- and that is reflected in the way that these five other people treated him and accepted him. The sister -- my mother\u2122s middle sister, so to speak, the sister that lives in Vineland, New Jersey , and her husband have always been, out of the three sisters, the most involved in Holo caust related activities. As Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 12you might know, the sister who lives in Vineland married a gentleman names Miles Lerman, who eventually became the chairman of the Holocaust Memorial Commission and Museum in Washington, D.C. .

            "answer": "There is -- looking back, th ere was some discussion abou t it, but more in latter days, more since the time I would be colle ge age, and in a way that isn\u2122t really reflective of how we were raised. Seeing our cousins was basically seeing our cousins and having fun. Of course, visiting Canada, those cousins from the oldest sister were a bit older than me and Paul, and I\u2122m sure they looked at us as -- as their nice, very much younger cousins visiting from New York. But we were entertained when we visited there, largely by my mother who -- who took us around and made sure that Paul and I had fun things to do. Howeve r, when we went down to the farm in Vineland, my cousin David , who is the younger of Krysia and Miles\u2122s two children, and was a boy as well, and was also involved in boy\u2122s scouting, was a hero to me and Paul.

Also, when we were growing up there came a point where David\u2122s older sister, since we saw th-this family more often, they were living in New Jersey, David\u2122s older sister was away at Brandeis for four years, and then went to Stanford for graduate school, so Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 14we didn\u2122t see her for long periods of time.

From our -- from my earliest recollection my parents have been members of the Hebrew tabernacle of Washington Heights, which is a synagogue that used to be on 161st and Fort Washington , but around 1972 or \u212273 move d closer to their home, to 185th Street and Fort Washington Avenue.

            "answer": "These -- these sorts of things came up, but only when -- I-I\u2122d say when I was over -- over the age of 17 or 18. In other words, after -- I graduated from high school early, so after I got out of high school and went to college and people became freer in talking -- or more interested maybe in talking about these things, and I -- I ki -- will tell you later a bit about some of the other people that -- that I knew and the things that we discussed in -- in those years. But as a child, this is not something the -- that the children used as a -- as a conversation item between them. Now, you were asking about -- about how I view education. When I went to the Bronx High School of Science, you can imag ine that like me there were many other children of survivors. And of course in those days, Bronx Science was heavily Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 21Jewish as a general matter, whether that be American Jews or Jews from other parts of the world, and not necessarily Holocaust survivors, per se. Then, at that point there was no formal Holocaust education class or program at Bronx Science, although I distinctly recall that these issues were discussed in social studies classes as -- as one would expect them to be, in the context of studying history. However, shortly after I left, the Bronx High School of Science opened what I believe was the first high school Holocaust study center of its kind in the United States, and it\u2122s there to this day. I actually happened to stop by Bronx Science last week cause I was in the neighborhood on business, to see one of my old history, or social studies teachers. And indeed, the center is -- we actually mentioned it, the center is still there, and the high school, though, has changed, and what -- what is wonderful about having the Holocaust center there now is that the student body is made up of children who might not know as much as we did when we were children, the reason being that Bronx Science, like Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech is now heavily Asian. And overall one could say that whereas the school was largely Jewish when I went there -- of course, there were -- there were hundreds and hundreds of other children from other backgrounds, whether th ey be -- were Protestants or Catholic, Irish or Greek or -- or -- or black Americans or Spanish. Now, the vast proportion, maybe not the majority, but a vast proportion of the students hail from Asia. And Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 22you can see that the minute you enter these schools. It -- this is just reflective, in many ways, of the changing ethnic face of New York City. And it\u2122s a wonderful thing to know that this center is serving these children\u2122s educational needs."

And I think it makes sense at this point to conti nue with your education. So, Bronx High school -- Science school, and then where do we -- where did you afterwards?",
            "answer": "When I graduated Bronx High School of Science, I went to Hamilton College in upstate New York. Earlier you asked me about my mother\u2122s ideas about education. One of the most interesting aspects of -- of -- of my outlook, and the counsel that I give to my children and others nowadays, is -- is my mother\u2122s attitude about going on to college. I think it was a given with every family in our neighborhood that their child ren would go on to college and probably graduate school. It wasn\u2122t just that. Many parents, including my wife\u2122s pa rents, believed that a child should maybe live at home or stay in their home city, etcetera, when they Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 23went to college. It\u2122s just sort of a continuation of high school in many ways. My mother was insistent all along -- she wasn \u2122t insistent meaning she w -- she would not ha-have -- put me to the guillotine had I decided to attend Columbia , or NYU or Fordham. You can rest assured, I\u2122m sure she would have been quite proud and supportive. However, from the earliest years my -- my mother encouraged me and Paul to think about going away to college. And why was this? She was v-very oopen about why this was. When my moth er came to America, she came under the supervision and the guardianship of her next oldest sister, which is Krysia, and Krysia\u2122s new husband Miles. And when they first came to America they lived together as a family in Brooklyn, and then Krysia gave birth to my cousin Jeanette, and my mother was involved in raising her. And then there came a point in time, the exact date I don\u2122t recall, but that\u2122s not really relevant, when Miles and Krysia decided to move to Vineland, New Jersey , and my mother was to stay on in Brooklyn and attend Brooklyn College. She had attended Thomas Jefferson High School first, wh-when she first got here, graduated and went onto Brooklyn College. While my mother was there, she received a very, very unique offer to teach Polish in a counterintelligence training program at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. Now needless to say, my mother, I am sure, did not know much, perhaps just a little, little bit, but not know much at all about what Indiana Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 24was or even perhaps where it was. But the offer included the opportunity to both teach and to finish her undergraduate education, at I -- I -- I\u2122m certain a -- a financially acceptable situation for her, given the fact that she was basically on her own. So off she went to Indiana . And she always told us as children how fondly she looked back on her experiences in Indiana. The point of what I\u2122m saying is specifically that she always told us how important it was in her upbringing, to be exposed to a different cultural and intellectual milieu, while she was in Indiana , from the one she would have been exposed to had she stayed here and attended Brooklyn College and finish her education there. And -- although of course, immediately after graduating from Indiana University, she did indeed move back to New York City, she always told us and still does to this day, how highly she valued the years that she spent there. Both the fact that she ha -- got a wonderful education, but also because she met so many different types of people from so many different backgrounds. The kinds of folks that came from all over America, particularly in Indiana, middle America, that she would never have seen here in New York during those years. And I suppose that th at in large part informed the way she counseled me and Paul about the -- maybe not advisability but about the weight we should give in -- in thinking of out of town schools. And you\u2122ll notice that both Paul and I went off to out of town school s. And the end of my four years at Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 25Hamilton, I did move back to New York City, but I moved back here at that point largely because the law school th at had selected me, which was New York University was a fine institution. If one, for example, in Boston, had accepted me that I wanted to attend, I would have gone to Boston, and perhaps eventually relocated to New York. As a matter of fact, now that I think back on it, I probably would have. But it wa -- the selection of venue for graduate school was not made with the same considerations that my selection of college was."

            "answer": "I am reasonably unique among the -- my fellow graduates from NYU law school and the class of 1980, in my having gone in to what\u2122s called public interest or public service law. Technically I\u2122m in public service law, meaning I\u2122m a government employee. But even while in law school, I was not drawn at all to the rather lucrative world of corporate or business law. Coming out of NYU law school, the doors are largely open to those wishing to practice those areas, and many, many, many of my friends went into those areas, and are doing financially quite well, I -- i-intellectually, we don\u2122t discuss. It\u2122s just the job, it\u2122s the same as running any other business. I always felt socially impelled t-to find something that I could do that would be of some good or service to othe rs, and -- and I felt a natural affinity for government service. I eventually dis -- sub -- I -- now I-I mean it\u2122s sub - sub - sub-specialty of the law, but I started when I -- I -- well, actually, when I was -- let me f -- let me restart that. When I was in law school, I clerked at a litigation firm. It was Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 27a union labor law litigation firm, but I found that I enjoyed litigation, it matches my personality type very much. And when I graduated from law school, I worked in -- in an admiralty insurance and personal injury litigation firm again, while still looking, all of the -- this time for a public service job that would suit my own personal, social and intellectual needs. I eventually was made a job offer by then the human resources administration of the city of New York, which was then the parent organization for the agency that I still work for, which is the New York City administration for Children\u2122s Services. And since New Year\u2122s of 1983, I\u2122ve worked exclusively in child neglect, child abuse and termination of parental rights litigation. I also have a -- a side specialty of immigration law as it pertains to children who are aliens, who find themselves in New York City foster care. That\u2122s sort of a sidelight of my own, but it\u2122s all within the same job."

            "answer": "I -- I think that might be reaching a bit. I think that even were my mother not a survivor, given the values that were imparted to me and Paul as children, an area of law that is somewhat related to social work, as mine is, would be the type of thing that I might have enjoyed doing. On the other hand, I -- I -- I -- well, actually it\u2122s not on the other hand, I really don\u2122t see much of a connection with -- with defense lawyers as well. I think that you -- you -- one might find some degree of social concern in children of the Holocaust, but for exampl e, my roommate from law school, from my first year there, who i-is the child of a survivor is now a partner in a very large corporate law firm, and he ha s been with them exclusively since we graduated from law school in 19 -- in 1980 . Actually, and sadly, his firm was one of the firms that was blown out of the World Trade Center, number one World Trade Center on September 11 th. And fortunately, all but one of his co-workers made it out of the building safely. And th-th-that\u2122s a wonderful thing. But a -- I -- I actually should tell you, it\u2122s a very interes ting story involving this young man. The summer before I attended NYU law school, I -- I had subscribed to live in their dormitory at NYU so I wouldn\u2122t have to commute from Washington Heights. I received a -- a note in the mail that -- you know, one of those, your roommate will be -- you know, John Smith, and his address and phone number are, if you want to contact him, go ahead. Well, I open the enve lope and there\u2122s this letter, and it says, Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 29your roommate will be Lawrence A. Bauer, 98 Park Terrace East, New York, New -- and I said, what? I can\u2122t believe this, it\u2122s Larry Bauer. It turns out that Larry Bauer -- first of all, I-I -- my earliest memory of him i-is coincident, both he and I, although he lives about a mile from my parents, his family belonged to the same synagogue and at the high holy days , their pew, it was the same -- we shared the sa -- the two families, the Bauers and the Gelbs were assigned seats in the same pew for years and years. Also, Larry and I, although he\u2122s a year older than me, attended day camp together for years and rode the same camp bus, although we weren\u2122t close, because we lived about a mile apart and traveled in different circles of friends and went to different schools, we knew each other reasonably well from those two contacts. So I was very, very pl eased, I called him, he received the same letter on the same day. And it was -- i-it was a really, really strange coincidence that we lived together, and while together we got to know -- obviously we\u2122re sharing a room for a year, we got to know each other much, much better. His -- to answer a question about him that you had asked me earlier, Larry\u2122s father came to America, a German Jew in the 1930\u2122s. Larry\u2122s mother, also a German Jew was incarcerated in Theresienstadt, a -- a survivor, e-e-eventually in Auschwitz , and -- but she, like m-my mother, survived the war. What makes them very, very different, meaning the two mothers, is the degree to which they were willing to go in discussing their Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 30wartime experiences. And all through law school -- at the time, Larry, of course knew what his mother\u2122s background was, but his mother would tell him that basically -- she basically had -- had given up on religion, although his father wa-wawas quite committed, because she -- and this is Larry\u2122s -- I\u2122m paraphrasing Larry\u2122s words, she felt that -- that God must have given up on the Jews in order for such a thing to have happened to her and to her entire family, which was lost. It was in more recent years, since the death of Larry\u2122s father that he started to talk in depth with his mother abou t these issues. And he asked her why it was that she didn\u2122t talk much about these things. A nd she s -- and she laughed and turned and said, what do you mean? She said, I\u2122m willing to talk about them, you just didn\u2122t ask me enough. In -- in the last few years, I-I\u2122m sure that his discoveries about his mother\u2122s background have grown geometrically, and that this is -- this is a -- a most in -- most intelligent and forthcoming woman, and I -- I just found it interesting that for whatever reason, Larry and I grew up in -- in basically parallel lives in Washington Heights, and Inwood, during our formative years, our knowledge base may have been the same, but the am ount that Holocaust issues was discussed in the house was quite different. The result is the same. I think we have about the same consciousness, and about the same re gard for our parents a-a-as each other, Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 31but I-I just think that i-it was a very interesting thing to shar e th-this reflection on our upbringing with -- with a roommate over the course of an entire year."

            "answer": "Yes, in -- indeed, my wife a -- is a child of a survivor as well. Interestingly enough, I did not meet her because of that in any way, shape or form. Quite simply my brother, while attending Bronx Science, didn\u2122t know th -this person who would eventually become my wife, but overheard he -- this person telling a teacher that she would be attending Hamilton College that coming fall. And I was at Hamilton at the time, and my brother said, wow, maybe Harry should meet her. So he called me and said, I saw this girl, and I saw that she was talking to such and such people and I\u2122m going to try to find out who she is. And when I came back at the end of my junior year from college, my brother had me introduced to Cheryl . And then, of course, we started dating and met he r family and I found as follows. Cheryl\u2122s father grew up in a suburb just west, just outside of L\u00f3dz in Poland, a little town called Aleksandr\u00f3w . His parents owned a sock factory, a very small one, but they Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 32manufactured socks, and he ca me from a very, very large Hassidic family. The family was very different from my mother\u2122s family, but basically his family was not atypical in any way. During the war his fa mily was broken up very, very rapidly, and he, being almost exactly the same age as my mother, it was a very, very young, but obvi -- what turned out to be very resilient little guy. Ver -- must have had tremendous inner strengths because unlike my mother, he was separated at the most early stages of the war from all of his siblings and relatives. My mother, fortunately, went through all of the war with her two olde r sisters, and most of the war with their father, before he was lost in Auschwitz . So Cheryl\u2122s -- Cheryl\u2122s father lost all of his family. One of his brothers apparently is -- so we hear, maybe an apocryphal story, may not, starved himself to death for lack of kosher food, when he -- when he reached the death camp. Whether this is so or not, I don\u2122t know. Other -- other ru -- unverifiable rumors are that his parents were gassed in the experimental gas trucks, the carbon monoxide poisoning trucks, earlie r on, during the Holocaust. But with such a large family, it\u2122s hard to say who went where. Th-The bottom line is that with the exception of his oldest sister, who had moved to then Palestine before the war, every other member of his family was lost. And this was a huge extended family. Cheryl -- also I should say , Cheryl\u2122s father was one of the earlier inmates of Auschwitz . You could tell this by his tattoo. He had a sloppily drawn, scrawled Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 33tattoo across much of his fore arm, much closer to the wrist. The -- it was just a series of numbers with no letters. This denotes a person who entered Auschwitz earlier on in Auschwitz\u2122s operation. Later in the war, when my mother got there with her sisters, the numbers were done much more neatly, inside the ar -- I -- I think the word is the crook or crick of the elbow. And because they had basically run out of numbers in the firs t series, they started adding a letter. So right away you could see that -- that -- that Max, that\u2122s Cheryl\u2122s father, had been at Auschwitz earlier. Very interesting what a tough little guy this man was. Not only did he survive from having been in Auschwitz from the earliest days, but he was sent to be a slave laborer, all though Germany during much of the war. He worked on everything from road crews to aircraft factories, to chemical plants. He used to refer to Igay, you know, I -- meaning I.G. Farben all the time. He worked in one of their plants, somewhere in Germany, I don\u2122t know exactly which one, but he was shunted from one facility to another as a slave laborer. Of course, he was lucky enough at the end of all these trials and tribulations to be sent back to Auschwitz for a little vacation. He ris -- he was sent to Auschwitz for the second time at approximately the same time that my mother was arriving there for the first time. And, of course, bo -- it\u2122s obvious he had to survive, because he gave birth to my wife. But both he and my mother, separately, survived the death marches after the Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 34evacuation of Auschwitz in January and then February and then March of 1945. But this Max, Cheryl\u2122s father, went through many, many, many, many hardships. He was a very, very small man physically, me aning in stature. And he credits other Jews who looked kindly upon him as sort of the little guy, to make him into a mascot and take him under their wing, to pr otect him, as time went on. I think he perhaps gave them too much credit and he should have complimented himself more on his amazing tenacity. He died, unfortuna tely, of lung cancer, in 1981, about a year -- a year after we got married -- meaning Cheryl and I got married. But I was able to share during the four or five year s that I knew him, much of his background with him. And as Cheryl\u2122s older sister is also tremendously interested in their -- their father\u2122s background and history, as was Cheryl. So between each of the two daughters, they really know quite a bit a-about his history. He -- after the war, he moved to Frankfurt in Germany just as my mother moved to Berlin with her sister Krysia. My mother\u2122s sister Hania, by the way, moved to Munich. Anyway, Max, in Frankfurt met a very, very nice person of Polish descent, meaning nonJewish Polish descent, and this is my mother-in-law. They -- they fell in love, and she converted to Judaism in Frankfurt, they were still dating for years, and filed their separate papers, one as -- as a refugee, one as an immigrant to come to America and arrive, I think, within about a year or two of each other, and w Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 35whereupon they were married, and they raised -- first they lived in -- in a -- basically a Holocaust survivor\u2122s enclave, in the area of 106th to 110th Street and Broadway. This is where both of their daughters were born, but my wife\u2122s older sister is five years older. I believe they li -- they lived with the children there for about six years and subsequently relocated to Riverdale. The chil -- both of their children attended -- I suppose the loose term is parochial school. What I should say is a progressive Jewish Day school, whereas I went to public school. Yet, each of the two girls ended up at the Bronx High School of Science for their secondary education."

First, I suppose I ex -- my -- am -- and in this my father was always willing to help me, expose myself to the history of world -- of World War , and the World War era in general. My father is a Korean war era veteran, having been too young to have served during World War , cause he was born in December of 1928. However, he was drafted u-upon his college graduation and served in the U.S. Army during the Korean war. But he was always willing to share the American view o-of the war with me, both the -- in the European and Pacific Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 37theaters. My mother, as I said, was always willing to share with me as a child a bit about her background, and not in a way that would horrify or scare her children, but in a way that was f-factually appropriate for what -- even now when I look back on it I would say that it was factually appropriate for a child to learn. For example, you don\u2122t say that people are gasping, they\u2122re choking, and they -- th at sort of thing, you\u2122d say that -- that they died. That\u2122s what you would tell a s -- a small child. Well, that\u2122s the way she would have talked. However, around the years that I got into junior high school, I developed an -- sort of an independent and some might view strange craving for information on the Holocaust. And -- and this is true, I -- I would, with frequency, stop by the public library branch near my junior high school, all the way down on 178th Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue, quite a bit out of our neighborhood, to look at Holocaust and World War history books. For example, I remember right now that the call numbers for all those books are in the 940\u2122s for nonfiction. I know it\u2122s a strange thing to remember, what can I tell you, I remember these things. I -- I remember distinctl y, looking through the transcripts of the Nuremberg Trials, which this -- this would have been in 1968 - 1969, it would have been reasonably new volumes to that library, this sort of a [indecipherable] and ho-how fascinated I was with -- with the justice that was being done, and I\u2122m sure I also had some lurid fascination with the -- the factual details o-of the horrors of extermination.

            "answer": "I think that it\u2122s very unusual that you bring that up and the statement you made is quite correct, even from -- from my viewpoint and I am her son. I think my mother, and actually all of the Holocaust survivor parents that I know are tremendously patriotic for America, a-and truly love the opportunities and freedoms that this countr y afforded them after they came here and became citizens. I can\u2122t overe mphasize that enough. And I think that that patriotism in many ways, I wouldn\u2122t say bli nds, but at least colors or informs the judgments that my -- or expectations that my mother had for the way society would evolve in this country. I think that my -- i-in particular my cousins from Vineland were -- I wouldn\u2122t think that they were exposed, it -- it\u2122s not that they were exposed to a -- a more liberal or progressive political point of view. It may be just that they evolved that way, for whatever reason. But my brother and I are more main line, as -- politically, as far as children who grew up in our general circumstances or milieu, whereas my cousins David and Jeanette might perhaps be s-said to be more liber al or more progressive. I think that in many ways growing up in New York City during a period when there were -- were Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 39desegregation issues, race riots, etcetera, may have influenced the way Paul and I looked at the development of society. This is not to say that -- that we a-agree with our mother\u2122s outlook. I will say that I distinctly recall my mother\u2122s reactions to the -- the cultural changes of the late 60\u2122s, and I often look back on the year of 1968 as a sort of -- I wouldn\u2122t say a high water mark, cause in my mother\u2122s estimation it was certainly not a -- a high water mark, but a salient date in the cultural changes of New York , of America and perhaps of the world. It was in that year, for example, that Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated. There were riots, there was a school strike here. There wa -- the Vietnam protests were at their height. The er -- the era of hippy-ness in America was reaching its height in tandem with the antiVietnam war movement. This was a period of tremendous change in this country, and the same sorts of things happened, you had the cultural revolution in China, you had the student riots in Paris, I mean, I remember these very well. We -- you also had the war that had occurred in Israel the year before. There -- there were lots of -- of changes, there was a lot of violence and turmoil in the war, and I -- i-in the world, excuse me, and I\u2122m sure that these things, given my mother\u2122s background, these -- these changes, it must -- must have in some way influenced her -- how -- how may we say it?"

But it would be interesting for me to know, which of the kind of cultural movements, or political events at that time, in the 60\u2122s and 70\u2122s were of particular importance to you? Any kind of particular impact? Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 42",
            "answer": "Wait. Outside of my -- my knowledge of the Holocaust, which of course is something that one -- one couldn\u2122t escape, living with a -- a -- a survivor, whether it was my mother, who was always ready to talk about things, or with someone who is more reticent. If you\u2122re asking about the hi storical developments that I was exposed to as a child, as a general matter, I would be happy to answer your question. I think that the desegregation movement of the 196 0\u2122s, which was in large part sparked by educational desegregation deci sion by the Supreme Court in Brown versus Board of Ed., in 1954, I believe, just before I was born, but not implemented until the re -- tru -- not implemented it really in fact and in detail until al -- the great society, Lyndon Johnston administration, really, really affected me strongly as to my sense of -- of equality, for opportunity for all people. I was highly, highly upset at the -- at Martin Luther King\u2122s death, much more so than at Robert Kennedy\u2122s death, which we -- they were both in the same season, I mean, I remember them both well. I think the reason for this was th-that I, even as a child, and I would have just been 12 years old then, viewed Martin Luther King as -- as a champion of -- well, obviously he was a champion of civil right s, but I mean a -- a champion of rights without being a revolutionary. And in a way that was more inclusive and less divisive than many other people would have been in seeking the same overall goals. What I think was interesting in my outlook at -- at least wh-when I look back as -- Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 43as a sort of revisionist, now, is that the desegregation movement of -- of the 60\u2122s, in -- in particular Martin Luther King\u2122s work, begat a lot of equal opportunity, equal employment opportunity and other e-equa l housing opportunity, equal health opportunity, equal educational opportunity movements in the 60\u2122s. The desegregation of schools I agreed with and I still do to this day, wholeheartedly. But I think that in affirmative action on the job, and in -- and in recruitment for -- for higher education, I think -- I thought then that it was perhaps a necessary thing, but I\u2122m coming to think now, after it\u2122s been a good 40 years of such programs, that perhaps the time has come as a matter of -- of social justice and to be more inclusive of all other types of peoples who\u2122 ve come here in the years since the 60\u2122s and have re-colored, both literally and figuratively the face of -- of America and New York in particular, that opportunity be based on merit and achievement, rather than on a blind consideration of a person\u2122s color or ethnic or religious background. And I say this even as a person who is the child of a survivor who was offered opportunities when she came here. I think what is different is that even children of survivors -- I shouldn\u2122t say children, even -- even we children of survivors who have parents who came here, saw that th ese parents, many of whom came over without education, without any bul -- physical belongings, without any money. Literally with just a carry-on bag in their hands, and a -- as they say, a hope in their Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 44hearts, were able to educate themselves, make careers, make families and raise those families and support themselv es, while there are many others in America, who -- nowadays, who one can say have equal opportunity, but it is my view, independently choose, and willingly in -- choose to not exercise those opportunities in -- wi-with even one-tenth the drive or ambition that the Holocaust survivors did a mere 50 years ago. I think that\u2122s a -- a ve ry, very important comparison and in some ways drives my changing outlook on affirmativ e action. Because I feel that there are just so many immigrants who come to America now who are willing to work hard for themselves, as did our parents, that th ey all have the equal opportunity to do the same sorts of things that our parents did for themselves and their families. And I -- I really don\u2122t feel at this point, that the g overnment should be requiring as a matter of law, or -- or monetarily subsidizing those who a-are not willing to exercise the rights and opportunities available to them."

Aside from formal education, which I\u2122ll discuss in a minute, I think a very unique portion of -- of Max\u2122s upbringing, meaning our older son\u2122s upbringing was th e fact that during his formative years, Cheryl was a senior staff member at New York City ballet. And at that time we lived directly across the street, literally a 15 second comm ute from her office in the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center. Max grew up basically as the New York City Ballet Company mascot. He and I were there every day because my wife worked evenings and we would go to say he llo to her, but not only to her, to all of her staff members and to the many members of the orchestra, and the dance company, with whom we became friends over the years. And she was there from 1985 to \u212295, and Max was born, as I said, in January of \u212289. So he had his first six years at the ballet, backstage, in the orchestra pit, in the flies, playing hockey in the Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 48back hallways. Hanging out at the dance bar and making believe he was -- he was a little nutcracker prince with some of the world famous prima ballerinas. It was a most unusual thing for a child to be exposed to this quantity of the performing arts on a day to day basis. The fu nny thing is that nowadays he enjoys going to these things very much, and is ev en actually -- last night he said to me, hey Dad, we\u2122ve gotta go see The Nutcracker. Because that\u2122s -- that\u2122s a performance that he adored as a child. But he is not willing to perform. He doesn\u2122t feel that he has any talents either in music or in dance. However, on the other hand, he\u2122s a phenomenal athlete and he\u2122s discovered in hims elf talents which I know I never had, and perhaps he inherited somehow from his Uncle Paul.

When he was in nursery school, I suppose you call it, pre-K at the Westside Montessori school, it was -- it was somewhat apparent to us that he might be a gifted child, and we ha d him tested, and were fortunate enough to Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 49find that he\u2122s a superlative gif -- superlatively gifted child. And he was accepted to a New York City public school program for -- for truly a-advanced children, and I\u2122m no-not -- I\u2122m n-not saying this in -- in any way to make him sound better than other children, it\u2122s just a fact that that\u2122s -- that\u2122s the whole definition of -- of the program he was in, it\u2122s called the Anderson program, and it -- and there are two programs like it in New York, Anderson program on the west side and Hunter College high school has its own progr am which goes all the way down to kindergarten on the east side. And so Max went to and attended the Anderson program and he graduated from there after the fifth grade and took an exam to get into another gifted program for junior high school level, that\u2122s called the Delta program. And it\u2122s -- it\u2122s -- basically it\u2122s the same kids and others who have joined them in a slightly larger program that he had gone to grade school with. And he\u2122s now in the seventh grade. He is getting a -- a regular, although accelerated and perhaps a bit more in depth junior high school education. He \u2122s doing very, very well, he -- this particular child, it\u2122s within his personality to be most competitive. He is -- I think if I had to descri -- us e one word to describe my own -- this particular child, I would say it\u2122s competitive. He has to be a medalist, meaning he has to get the gold, or the silver or the bronze, and he\u2122s very happy to get any one of them, although everyone wants the gold, bu t he\u2122s happy to get them.

The sufferings of people, crime, death, disease. I -- I -- we really don\u2122t hide anything from him. That may or may not be good for him in the long run, I don\u2122t know. I\u2122ve tried to encourage him to be independent. He was the first of all of his friends to travel on his own through the city. I have entrusted him since th-the fourth grade, basically, with being on his own and shifting for himself. I expect him to lead his friends. I -- I\u2122ve always tried to foster in him the ability to lead not only himself, but his friends. To be responsible for himself and his friends, to keep a lookout for himself and his friends, to protect them, but to achieve. And the funny thing is that things i-in many ways have gone that way, and among his friends, whether by dint of his upbringing here, or the fact that he is among the older of the children in his age group, or a combination of those factors, he is looked upon by the other children as a sort of a social hub, a leadership figure. And perhaps it\u2122s because he\u2122s so involved in spor ts and the boys follow him in that way. Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 53Perhaps it\u2122s because he actually is very talented in school. That he\u2122s getting homework help calls all the time, and his guidance is sought as to what is expected of them in school. It\u2122s just that he -- he\u2122s grown up to be a very unusual child in that regard. The downside of this is that his tolerance for others and his patience with them sometimes wears a little bit thin. So I think that these might be the sorts of responsibilities that a 12 or 13 year old boy shouldn\u2122t have thrust upon him. But he handles it pretty well overall, and -- and -- and his friends love him. He has a whole crowd of -- of friends that are hanging out here all the time. One, we\u2122ve always tried to make th-the other kids feel welcome around our house so that they -- they -- they should always feel they have a place to come, if they want to sleep over, or they want to hang here, have dinner. Whatever they want, they\u2122re welcome to stay, it\u2122s fine by me. And it\u2122s alway -- it\u2122s fine by Cheryl , too, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s fine by all of us, but we -- we always want our children to have their friends welcome."

In -- in -- she also encouraged us and my father did as well, i-in boy scouting, that -- I think that was a movement that was very much in Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 54tandem, since it\u2122s a slightly more conser vative movement, especially in the 60\u2122s, than the rest of -- of society at large. It was probably very much in line with her expectations about the way boys should be reared. And because of that she allowed and encouraged both me and Paul to continue in scouting. Both of us achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, and actually to this day I\u2122m involved in boy scouting. I am now one of the directors of the same group that I was in as a child. And Max was involved in cub scouting and started in boy scouting, but since the last year in junior high, I think his interests have changed an d his social group has changed, and I\u2122m certainly not going to force his continuation in scouting upon him. I just think that this is an interest that has sort of fallen out with Max, perhaps for the good, perhaps not, but I\u2122m certainly would -- I wouldn\u2122t force my children to do anything. So right now Max is not involved. But that\u2122s okay t oo, he\u2122s involved in so many other things, whether it be in sports, social affairs, or his Bar Mitzvah studies, that I don\u2122t even think he has room in his life for the boy scouts.

Personally, I have never been to Israel, and I\u2122ve never had the good fo rtune to have the time to get there i-in a way that I would have liked. However, my wife has been to Israel several times, in large part because, as I said, her -- her fa ther had an oldest sister who had -- who had immigrated to Palestine in the 1930\u2122s as part of a -- a -- a Zionist [indecipherable] movement. And because she had this one aunt there, Cheryl had gone there throughout her childhood to visit the aunt and uncle and cousins, along with her family. However, we have traveled, indeed, extensively, all through Europe . And in the summer of 1984, while Poland was still a Communist country, we went to visit Poland, to visit the few relatives that Cheryl\u2122s mother still has there, and also to tour where my mother and where Cheryl\u2122s father had grown up, and to visit Auschwitz. That\u2122s what we did there for a -- a week. I went with Cheryl and her sister. None of us had any ch ildren in those days.

This began because in 1983, the city -- this city, New York City [indecipherable] was a part of the official U.S. government refugee assistance program that was -- started to resettle people from southeast Asia in the wake of the Vietnam conflict, and they were taking both families and unaccompanied refugee minors from refugee camps in southeast Asia and resettling them either in the Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 58community or in various foster care agencies throughout the United States. This -- they were joined shortly thereafter by a large influx of people from the Cuban and Haitian boatlifts in the very early 1980\u2122s. So already by the mid-1980\u2122s, our population and our program wa s -- was largely made up of children from southeast Asia, from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, and also from Haiti or Cuba."

            "answer": "As I was telling you a -- a moment ago, the city\u2122s refugee program had largely a southeast Asian and then some Haitian and Cuban children in it. We eventually placed about 1400 children through federal referrals into that program. However, as I worked during the 1980\u2122s, it became readily apparent that this being New York City and all, there were children in the foster care system due to abuse and neglect, here in New York City, who hailed from other countrie s. Some of these children were entitled and continue to be entitled to immigration law relief, and there are Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 59special federal laws that --that assist childre n who find themselves in the foster care situation without having parents willing to help them to realize i-immigration benefits. So even though the federally funded refugee program has basically petered out, and out of about the 1400 children, all of them have aged out, meaning have gone over the age of 21, except for three children who came over when they were very, very small, we now have hundreds of children that I have been able to identify, out of the 30,000 children in the foster care system now, who have immigration law needs that I am able to se rvice. And I have found overall, i-it -- through my very fortunate participation w ith all of these children, that refugee children tend to be very, very driven, very, very self-reliant and very, very motivated to make something of themselves and to utiliz e the opportunities that are offered them by placement in New York City\u2122s foster care system. Basically, in lay terms one can say they\u2122ve got free room, board and education through their 21 st birthday. As long as they continue to make something of themselves, to attend school, to get an after-school job, and to basically just grow and become good human beings, they can stay with us until they\u2122re 21 years old. And i-i-it\u2122s much to their credit and much to my constant amazement and joy that these children continue to flourish despite the fact that many other children in our foster care system never seem to achieve much in their lives and unfortunately end up many Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 60times in the same sort of conditions that their parents had when the children ended up in foster care. So it\u2122s -- it\u2122s very, very much of a pleasure for me to be involved with this refugee population."

But I think o-oother people are motivated by other things an d arrive at -- at the same place where I find myself, but perhaps -- for me this is -- this is what -- what does it. I think it uncanny that I met and then married someone who is the -- like me, a -- a -- a child of -- of survivors. Yeah, I don\u2122t know whet her that is good or bad, I think it\u2122s a very unique bond. I -- I found in my office, and no w I\u2122m -- I\u2122m a supervisor in -- in -- in our Bronx office, and through conversation after being there a year, I found out that one of my co-workers, who is significantly younger than me is also the child of a survivor who was a hidden ch ild. And he was hidden as a very, very -- he\u2122s even younger -- he was born sometime in the 1930\u2122s and waited a while to have children after coming here and marrying, so this co-worker of mine i-is significantly younger. And yet, I know that -- that she an d I feel an -- an -- sort of there\u2122s an unusual kinship or bond there, even th ough his -- his, meaning her father\u2122s Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 65experience, wartime experiences, and my mo ther\u2122s were -- were quite dissimilar. But i-i-it\u2122s an unusual bond. I am sure that other people who share similar traumatic experiences in their family histories probabl y feel a similar bond as well, but this is what our family feels, and this is what Laura\u2122s family feels. And I\u2122m sure that -- you know, and my wife and her sister and all of my co usins, we all feel the same. It\u2122s just an unusual way to identify -- I think that there are many Jews who identify as being Jews in large part due to the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust somehow awakening a Jewish identity in them. I suppose religious motivation comes from many different things in one\u2122s upbringing. So in mine, obviously, it must come in large part due to the fact that my mother herself is a survivor. Never -- nevertheless, i-it ca -- her experiences canno t but have a-affected my outlook on the world, on religion, on my social values and morals, and by the way I raise my family.

They -- they -- I -- I think that much of their hatred is tantamount -- although it is worded differently than Hitler\u2122s hatred of the Jews, I think it\u2122s tantamount to Hitler\u2122s hatred of the Jews. And although the -- the current terrorists will never be able to perpetrate the mass execution o-of Jews, as -- as Hitler and the Nazis were, I still think that were that to be a thing within their grasp, many of these people would not hesitate to do that. I -- even -- even among Muslims of a -- a more gentle persuasion who are not violent like -- like the terrorists, I really -- I-I sincerely question whether even they, based upon their doctrine and their beliefs and their culture will ever able to be accept -- to be able to accept the fact of the existence of a Jewish state in the land of Palestine.
