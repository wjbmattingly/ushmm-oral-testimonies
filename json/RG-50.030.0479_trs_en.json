And I know that my brother took some Hebrew lessons, which, I didn\u2122t know why. You know, we kids were not told anything. We were not told when somebody was sick. As a matter of fact I could never forget that my parents never told me when my beloved grandpa died. I just found out when I came to visit grandma and grandpa wa s gone. We were never told anything. They didn\u2122t tell us what the financial situation is, what --cause we lived -- we -- we didn\u2122t f -- I didn\u2122t feel we don\u2122t money or something, you know, afterwards. We lived in the same apartment. We didn\u2122t have to move. We had to give up -- later on we had to give up a room that was among the Jews and Jewish community to -- people lost apartments, because if they lived in a certain part of Prague where the SS moved in, they wanted to have it clean of Jews, and they moved out. Somebody else had to take them in. We took in two women that were refugees from Austria, two old women, they were only in their 60\u2122s. To me they seemed ancient. And then we had a -- when they were deported away, which was interesting, Mother told me later, they had poison [indecipherable] and they said Hitler will not get them. But they said they -- they were going to L\u00f3dz -- they went in the first five transports -- they said we will never let him torture us, to Mother, but we won\u2122t do it, because you have kids. So when you asked about the suicides, the German Jews had -- some had poison [indecipherable] and the Austrian. We did not, the Czechs, didn\u2122t think about that ever. And then we had another Austrian family, a man and a wife, because when they left, we had to take somebody else. That was not the German decision that the apartment was too big for a family. A nd a friend of mine lived with us, too. It was the decision of the Jewish community, agreement. You know, they -- they had to take care of them -- their own people, nobody else would. And I think everyone complied gladly, we didn\u2122t need that much room. 24"

It was like a social club, you know , because you couldn\u2122t have it grow big, because only few people could come to the house, cause if it was too many it was seen by others and it could be considered that we are planning some thing against the Germans, or -- so the groups had to be very small. I was in a very nice group and I have pictures when we put up plays and we put up plays with -- with our friend Rhode, and then we showed it to the parents, so we had something to do in the afternoon.

Bicycles had to be given -- my brother owned a bicycle, I never did because my mother wouldn\u2122t let me ride a bike, I would have muscles on my legs, legs should be nice and smooth. So my brother, to give up his bicycle, what he did is he let out the air from the -- from the bike, and walked it, so that he ruined the wheels and everything because he says he\u2122s not going to give it in a good condition to the Germans. And the radio we didn\u2122t give up either. From this non-Jewish friend, the father came and switched the radio, he had a very ordinary radio, where he could catch only one station. And my father gave him the short wave radio, and then he would come and tell my father what\u2122s happening at night, slip in under darkness. So the ordinary radio, the Germans did get. So you didn\u2122t -- we didn\u2122t -- were not allowed to have a telephone. All my life I -- we had a telephone, my father had, and we were not allowed to have it afterward. So they\u2122d stripped us of everything, and every time we thought it\u2122s th e last thing. And another thing what the Germans did which was cruel, every Jewish holiday, some laws came up against the Jews. So when Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah was approaching, we were thinking, what will come this time? What w ill they take away this time? The jewelry? This is my mother\u2122s ring. She always wore it so I never got another one from Edgar. So that\u2122s her -- I don\u2122t know whether it was her mother\u2122s or whether my father gave it to her.

My father had his sword, cause he was in the Austrian army, and had a revolver -- had a -- a handgun at home. So he had to give that up, that was the very first thing. So they stripped you slowly of all your right, and before you knew it, you were like a slave, you had no rights at all.

So we got the notice that everyone has to be counted, we didn\u2122t know how extensive it is, and what it means, but we had to line up in the courtyard at five in the morning. Because it was November, some people took a blanket with them, which was very good, because it was fr-freezing cold to stand there all day. We didn\u2122t know what they\u2122ll do. And they marched us into this place, which was not like a valley, but it was surrounded by little 57 higher, you know, not wall, the earth was like a division between fields, but it was higher, much higher, so -- there\u2122s a Czech word for it, like a small valley or something. And they marched you by hundreds, always. And we came th ere, and we were one of the first ones, so we were right on the edge. And they put the SS with machine guns on top of these things, so we got little frightened what will be on -- they going to shoot us here? They said to count, somebody supposedly ran away, and there the count was off. And I never heard counting one by one. So I think it took nearly all morning till everybody got assembled there, or till 10 - 11, I have no id ea. And then people started to walk around. My brother lived me and my parents, but I was the only one -- by that time my father got the room in one of the houses, and Mother and Father lived together, because he was also privileged. And I still stayed in Hamburger, and my brother found with a friend in the cellar a room, and they made themselves in the cellar a -- a room for them. So he lived near my parents, so they were together in the column, but I was again separated. So then my f -- brother found me, and I went over to say hi to my parents, that I\u2122m okay, and everybody\u2122s there. But then you were afraid, because the Germans were walking by, and you were not allowed to move. And when you have to go to the bathroom, luckily you had the blanket, somebody put it around you. A nd they were counted, one by one every column was counted. And it was getting dark, in -- in -- in November, it\u2122s not so long daylight. And we decided to talk how nice it will be, I will kiss my bunk if I get home. We didn\u2122t know whether we will be there all night. It was pretty upsetting. So by 11 at night we got home. We were again the last ones, because we were the first ones coming in, some got earlier. The next day my father sa id that\u2122s it, the family has to be together, you have to move in. So I moved in with my parents, I was very willing. I didn\u2122t like to be separated. My brother was again with them, and I was in. My brother lived in the house next to them, so the whole block of hous es went together, he was not separated. So there was not room for another bed, so on the floor we put the trunks, and then we separated them -- the door was blocked. And -- and when -- during the day we put them up like a seat. So that was the room I had th ere with my parents, in November \u212243."
