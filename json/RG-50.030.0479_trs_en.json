But I know that we were -- my father tried to get out in a way. I don\u2019t know what all this happened. Cause we found a letter that a friend of his from Palestine had a job for him. And I know that my brother took some Hebrew lessons, which, I didn\u2019t know why. You know, we kids were not told anything. We were not told when somebody was sick. As a matter of fact I could never forget that my parents never told me when my beloved grandpa died. I just found out when I came to visit grandma and grandpa was gone. We were never told anything. They didn\u2019t tell us what the financial situation is, what --cause we lived -- we -- we didn\u2019t f -- I didn\u2019t feel we don\u2019t money or something, you know, afterwards. We lived in the same apartment. We didn\u2019t have to move. We had to give up -- later on we had to give up a room that was among the Jews and Jewish community to -- people lost apartments, because if they lived in a certain part of Prague where the SS moved in, they wanted to have it clean of Jews, and they moved out. Somebody else had to take them in. We took in two women that were refugees from Austria, two old women, they were only in their 60\u2019s. To me they seemed ancient. And then we had a -- when they were deported away, which was interesting, Mother told me later, they had poison [indecipherable] and they said Hitler will not get them. But they said they -- they were going to Lodz -- they went in the first five transports -- they said we will never let him torture us, to Mother, but we won\u2019t do it, because you have kids. So when you asked about the suicides, the German Jews had -- some had poison [indecipherable] and the Austrian. We did not, the Czechs, didn\u2019t think about that ever. And then we had another Austrian family, a man and a wife, because when they left, we had to take somebody else. That was not the German decision that the apartment was too big for a family. And a friend of mine lived with us, too. It was the decision of the Jewish community, agreement. You know, they -- they had to take care of them -- their own people, nobody else would. And I think everyone complied gladly, we didn\u2019t need that much room."

Jews were not allowed to be on the streets from eight to five unless they had a special permit. Jews had -- there was from the beginning, eight o\u2019clock was Sperre, we called.

You have to understand, by this time we are teenagers, so we want to be out little later. We couldn\u2019t. That was the next thing. Then came that we were not allowed to go through park. So when I went downtown, or walking, we had to go around the parks. Nothing where green grew, you could go around. Then we were not allowed to go to the main squares. To the [indecipherable] like [indecipherable] squares, the old squares, you had to go around, on the out squares. Then came you couldn\u2019t go in the street car, only the last train, the last platform. And if it was full, 1t was your bad luck, you couldn\u2019t get on, couldn\u2019t get on, wait for the next one. We couldn\u2019t go to any coffeehouses, because the Czechs were -- even the young one used to be -- would go for a coffee or dessert in the afternoon, walking, and then sit down for a coffee. That was fibil, no coffeehouses at all, no movies, no theater, no concerts, nothing. So what we did, like young people, we met in -- every Saturday and Sunday with a group, in somebody else\u2019s house. And what was happening, these groups became very close. You couldn\u2019t bring a friend unless everyone agreed. It was like a social club, you know, because you couldn\u2019t have it grow big, because only few people could come to the house, cause if it was too many it was seen by others and it could be considered that we are planning something against the Germans, or- so the groups had to be very small. I was in a very nice group and I have pictures when we put up plays and we put up plays with -- with our friend Rhode, and then we showed it to the parents, so we had something to do in the afternoon.

So my brother, to give up his bicycle, what he did 1s he let out the air from the -- from the bike, and walked it, so that he ruined the wheels and everything because he says he\u2019s not going to give it in a good condition to the Germans. And the radio we didn\u2019t give up either. From this non-Jewish friend, the father came and switched the radio, he had a very ordinary radio, where he could catch only one station. And my father gave him the short wave radio, and then he would come and tell my father what\u2019s happening at night, slip in under darkness. So the ordinary radio, the Germans did get. So you didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t -- were not allowed to have a telephone. All my life I -- we had a telephone, my father had, and we were not allowed to have it afterward. So they\u2019d stripped us of everything, and every time we thought it\u2019s the last thing. And another thing what the Germans did which was cruel, every Jewish holiday, some laws came up against the Jews. So when Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah was approaching, we were thinking, what will come this time? What will they take away this time? The jewelry? This is my mother\u2019s ring. She always wore it so I never got another one from Edgar. So that\u2019s her -- I don\u2019t know whether it was her mother\u2019s or whether my father gave it to her.

My father had his sword, cause he was in the Austrian army, and had a revolver- had a -- a handgun at home. So he had to give that up, that was the very first thing. So they stripped you slowly of all your right, and before you knew it, you were like a slave, you had no rights at all. And you -- if you didn\u2019t step -- when the SS man walked on the pavement, when -- we had to step down into the gutter, whatever. We were not allowed to be in the pavement when the SS walked by."

Her parents lived outside, and they wanted her to learn the profession, so she was learning to sew in some other place than I did. And she lived with us and we shared a room, and ti -- tha -- used to go weekends to her parents [indecipherable] just fun. But then even that was forbidden because Jews couldn\u2019t travel by train at all.

And her brother also stayed in Prague, and lived with my aunt, who was around the corner, wasn\u2019t very far. So within, you know the group you were, and you had one or two groups, because you met Saturday and Sunday with others. You paired up with a boyfriend.

And I had to lug the luggage, and we walked from Bohusovice to Terezin, and some people fainted, and some people couldn\u2019t make it, it was very hot. I did. And when we came into the -- they brought us to Hanover barracks. That was the Schleusse they called it, the accepting barracks. Didn\u2019t take long and my boyfriend was there, telling me, I have your trunk. And I told him right away to tell my friend that I am here, which he did. And he brought her over, he smuggled her in, because nobody was allowed to come near us. And they had to process us again. And her mother arranged that they move me to Hamburger where they were staying. She took over like my mother, her mother, and she later on saved my life again. So when we came to register, I already had a address where to go, I went straight to Hamburg, and then my friend said she\u2019s working at the mica production, where we peeled the mica. So she went immediately and signed me up for that. So the next day I went to work with her. So I had somebody there. And then you start -- and then I tried to locate my grandma, who was there. My grandmother, si -- about three weeks before me -- 15 -- or four weeks, 15\" of June she left Prague, my grandmother. So then my boyfriend located her, and that\u2019s when I say Edgar is wrong, it wasn\u2019t yet opened the ghetto, he had to get me a false document, of another girl to -- so I can go to visit her into that house. And I did, and I saw my grandma."

So she got the whole thing, and she had to divide it into 40, so there was enough, you got a big s -- soupspoon of sugar, if was more, you got two.

You did have blankets. So we slept with Eva huddled together under two blankets, we didn\u2019t need each a blanket. In summer it was much worse.

And un -- they -- they were stopped by some SS, and they found some lettuce.

But while we there -- we were there, we didn\u2019t. But that was the only time I was frisked like that. And because the gendarmes were there, and of course they knew us, they were watching with us, we had to strip to be naked, we called it fashion show.

So we got the notice that everyone has to be counted, we didn\u2019t know how extensive it 1s, and what it means, but we had to line up in the courtyard at five in the morning. Because it was November, some people took a blanket with them, which was very good, because it was fr-freezing cold to stand there all day. We didn\u2019t know what they\u2019II do. And they marched us into this place, which was not like a valley, but it was surrounded by little higher, you know, not wall, the earth was like a division between fields, but it was higher, much higher, so -- there\u2019s a Czech word for it, like a small valley or something. And they marched you by hundreds, always. And we came there, and we were one of the first ones, So we were right on the edge. And they put the SS with machine guns on top of these things, so we got little frightened what will be on -- they going to shoot us here? They said to count, somebody supposedly ran away, and there the count was off. And I never heard counting one by one. So I think it took nearly all morning till everybody got assembled there, or till 10 - 11, I have no idea. And then people started to walk around. My brother lived me and my parents, but I was the only one -- by that time my father got the room in one of the houses, and Mother and Father lived together, because he was also privileged. And I still stayed in Hamburger, and my brother found with a friend in the cellar a room, and they made themselves in the cellar a -- a room for them. So he lived near my parents, so they were together in the column, but I was again separated. So then my f -- brother found me, and I went over to say hi to my parents, that I\u2019m okay, and everybody\u2019s there. But then you were afraid, because the Germans were walking by, and you were not allowed to move. And when you have to go to the bathroom, luckily you had the blanket, somebody put it around you. And they were counted, one by one every column was counted. And it was getting dark, in -- in -- in November, it\u2019s not so long daylight. And we decided to talk how nice it will be, I will kiss my bunk if I get home. We didn\u2019t know whether we will be there all night. It was pretty upsetting. So by 11 at night we got home. We were again the last ones, because we were the first ones coming in, some got earlier. The next day my father said that\u2019s it, the family has to be together, you have to move in. So I moved in with my parents, I was very willing. I didn\u2019t like to be separated. My brother was again with them, and I was in. My brother lived in the house next to them, so the whole block of houses went together, he was not separated. So there was not room for another bed, so on the floor we put the trunks, and then we separated them -- the door was blocked. And -- and when -- during the day we put them up like a seat. So that was the room I had there with my parents, in November \u00b043."
