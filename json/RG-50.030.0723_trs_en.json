And so, they were \u2014 they were told that they could leave. Well, they wanted something to eat, so they were eating American rations, and so on, and \u2014 but \u2014 but the thing is, a lot of those people couldn\u2019t even walk, they didn\u2019t know where they were from, they didn\u2019t know what they were gonna see when they got home, and the \u2014 this \u2014 Interview with Norman Coulson \u201c October 4, 2013 the roads were just fi-filled with people all over the place, and the ro \u2014 other ca \u2014 other prisoners in other camps, they were also let go. And they were all, everybody was out in the street, walking, just walking, they didn\u2019t know where they were going. So \u2014 and there was no transportation provided for them, so \u2014 so you just \u2014 they \u2014 I don\u2019t know what ever happened to these people, I have no idea. I was just there in the camp, just happy to be \u2014 be there. And I remember one day some bird colonel walked in the office and said, Coulson, it\u2019s good to see you here, he said, I'll see you when you leave. And that was my orders. So I \u2014 I had been da \u2014 a couple of times during the year, I was to the commandants ca \u2014 to his house, which was located right in the middle of the camp, and I was there for couple drinks and so on, I guess we had some wine and so on, but that\u2019s the only \u2014 that\u2019s the only orders I had, and I was there for a year. And then eventually the \u2014 the war crimes trials came in t-to the camp, and they \u2014 and they tried the \u2014 the people that were still living. And the doctor was there that did all the experiments on these prisoners, poor souls, and they\u2019re treated like animals. Animals are better treated than these people were. And I met a lot of people. I met people from Austria and so on. I met a count there, and I met the other \u2014 the officers\u2019 mess \u2014 the American officers\u2019 mess had a\u2014 a German chef, who I had him \u2014 I don\u2019t know, and he and I became friends. So \u2014 so he wanted me to \u2014 to go half on a ski lodge down in the mountains. So one Interview with Norman Coulson \u201d October 4, 2013 day he took me down to see the ski lodge, it was a beautiful place. Anyway, he said \u2014I said, well, what are \u2014 what do I have to put into it to buy this? He said, well, do you ha \u2014 for half of 1t you\u2019re going to have to come up with 300 American dollars, with real, actual cash. And we said \u2014 I said, I\u2019m not allowed to have American cash here. So he said, well, can you get it? And I se \u2014 I wrote to my wife and said, just send me 300 American dollars, which she did. And anyway, I said to this \u2014 this German chef that \u2014 but which was going to be my partner for the \u2014 the chateau. And \u2014and I said, how am I gonna get my money out of it when I leave here, how can \u2014 how can I get my money? Cause there was no \u2014 no di \u2014 no transfer of money funds or anything else between the countries at that time. And anyway, he said I don\u2019t know. So I ended up selling my money on the black market and I did pretty well with that. But so \u2014 my 300 dollar \u2014 I don\u2019t know what these poor souls did with the American money. Most cases I sold it to the \u2014 the Germans, they bought most of the money, because Americans weren\u2019t allowed to have it."
