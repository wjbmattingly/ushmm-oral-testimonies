And they were all, everybody was out in the street, walking, just walk ing, they didn\u2122t know where they were going. So \u0152 and there was no transportation provided for them, so \u0152 so you just \u0152 they \u0152 I don\u2122t know what ever happened to these people, I have no idea. I was just there in the camp, just happy to be \u0152 be there. And I remember one day some bird colonel walked in the office and said, Coulson, it\u2122s good to see you here, he said, I\u2122ll see you when you leave. And that wa s my orders. So I \u0152 I had been da \u0152 a couple of times during the year, I was to the commandants ca \u0152 to his house, which was located right in the middle of the camp, and I was there for couple drinks and so on, I guess we had some wine and so on, but that\u2122s the only \u0152 that\u2122s the only orders I had, and I was there for a year. And then eventually the \u0152 the war crimes trials came in t-to the camp, and they \u0152 and they tried the \u0152 the people that were still living. And the doctor was there that did all the experiments on these prisoners, poor souls, and they\u2122re treated like animal s. Animals are better treated than these people were. And I met a lot of people. I met people from Austria and so on. I met a count there, and I met the other \u0152 the officers\u2122 mess \u0152 the American officers\u2122 mess had a \u0152 a German chef, who I had him \u0152 I don\u2122t know, and he and I became friends. So \u0152 so he wanted me to \u0152 to go half on a ski lodge down in the mountains. So one Interview with Norman Coulson October 4, 2013 29day he took me down to see the ski lodge, it was a beautiful place. Anyway, he said \u0152 I said, well, what are \u0152 what do I have to put into it to buy this? He said, well, do you ha \u0152 for half of it you\u2122re going to have to come up with 300 American dollars, with real, actual cash. And we said \u0152 I said, I\u2122m not allowed to have American cash here. So he said, well, can you get it? And I se \u0152 I wrote to my wife and said, just send me 300 American dollars, which she di d. And anyway, I said to this \u0152 this German chef that \u0152 but which was going to be my partner for the \u0152 the chateau. And \u0152 and I said, how am I gonna get my mone y out of it when I leave here, how can \u0152 how can I get my money? Cause there was no \u0152 no di \u0152 no transfer of money funds or anything else between the countries at that time. And anyway, he said I don\u2122t know. So I ended up selling my money on the black market and I did pretty well with that. But so \u0152 my 300 dollar \u0152 I don\u2122 t know what these poor souls did with the American money. Most cases I sold it to the \u0152 the Germans, they bought most of the money, because Americans weren\u2122t allowed to have it."
