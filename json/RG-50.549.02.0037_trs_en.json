After the ghetto experiences and hiding, I sort of saved myself by going to school instead of being forced to go into the Russian army and become artillery meat. I had no other, basically, I -- I had nothing in my background that would prepare me to ma- for th -- 1-1-1 -- to survive, to make a living. My family was quite wealthy and they sort of isolated me from normal life. I was not in touch with business. The only thing I knew is more or less engineering and education.

            "answer": "This was my crutch for survival. That\u2019s what -- Basically, that\u2019s what helped me survive, also. In looking back, when we left my hometown Lida, in 1940, and went to Lvov, the reason why we went to Lvov, there were two-fold reasons, basically. One, that my mother and myself, we were able to get the Russian passports -- acceptable Russian passports. By that, meaning that our occupation -- my occupation became student and my mother\u2019s occupation becau -- became a working person, robotche. In spite the fact that we were Capitalists, according to the definition of USSR at that time. The reason why we picked Lvov, because I wanted to go to Vilna. But Vilna had not polytechnic institute. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 37 7 And Vilna got separated from Lida, because at that time, they made a separate country out of Lithuania. That would have meant crossing a border and difficulty in getting in touch with the family. So, we picked Lvov, where we could sort of disappear. Lvov, normally a city of 150,000, at that time had maybe 300,000, with all the refugees coming from Krakow, from Warsaw. It was on the Russian side of the divided Poland, from the -- after \u201839. And I was able to -- I was accepted to the non -- the pothip -- to the Polytechnic Institute. And that was my crutch, I figured I can -- I ha -- I have no other background -- I have nothing in my background that will allow me to make a living. I had to be on my own. Fortunately, the Russians were offering scholarships. Top students were getting a -- the -- a -- it\u2019s not a scholarship, a stipend -- a living allowance and coupons where you could buy things or you could purchase things. And I -- I have looked -- I have my -- the booklet where they have entered my grades and I have never anything -- I never had anything below a B -- what you would call B in here.

In fact, they did it before the killed the Jews, they killed the Polish -- the Polish professors in Lvov. But the-they -- Lvov itself was not bombed, was not destroyed.

Okay, one thing I want to mention, which 1s maybe I was forced into my educational backgrounds, trying to learn things and trying to -- to study. My family, when I was growing up, kept me sort of isolated from the business end. My grandfather had a -- together with -- with other partners, they had a major wholesale business, a hardware wholesale in -- in -- in -- in our town. They had some factories, some other interests and so on. I was never involved, never introduced to the business end of the whole thing. So, actually, to start something on my own, to go and earn a living, I didn\u2019t know how to do it. It was -- I -- I bi -- I -- I -- I was afraid.

I didn\u2019t know how to start a business, how to run a business, how to buy and sell and maybe I was afraid that someone will take advantage of me. That\u2019s why I -- I\u2019ve -- I --I thought that if I pursue an education, we -- if I try to learn things, I might be able, through there -- offer my services to the highest bidder, in a way.

            "answer": "Yes. I think I did. I think I did. First of all, I was running a business, a division of a company. Eventually I had to give it up, because the president of the company died. In sfite the fact -- 1n spite the fact that they went on the stock market at one time, then they had to withdraw because the thing ca -- became too small. It was a family affair and there was no room where to advance. It\u2019s -- The family took it over and it became sort of a stagnant. Then I was able to run a business, a retail business in a -- basically in 99 percent, at that time Black area -- Afro-American area -- you want to ca -- any way you want to call it, and bees -- be halfway successful. Because I think I was liked out there by my people with whom I made nice friendships. We knew each other quite well and it translated into good business and to them into good service. And we were friendly -- fr- friends with each other, supportive of each other in a way. I mean, they needed help, I needed help. My help was one way, their help was moral support and sometimes financial support and we -- we sort of survived. Maybe that what -- that -- that helped me.

The only basic inheritance was my wife\u2019s, you know, the end of the liquor store, which I had to pay my -- pay out my brother-in-law, cause he decided he -- he wanted -- decided to go to California. Unfortunately, he passed on. It\u2019s -- The whole family 1s -- is dead, which is very disturbing. No one to argue with."
