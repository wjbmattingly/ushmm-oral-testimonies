After the ghetto experiences and hiding, I sort of saved myself by going to school instead of being forced to go into the Russian army and become artillery meat. I had no other, basically, I -- I had nothing in my background that would prepare me to ma- for th -- 1-1-1 -- to survive, to make a living. My family was quite wealthy and they sort of isolated me from normal life. I was not in touch with business. The only thing I knew is more or less engineering and education.

            "answer": "This was my crutch for survival. That\u2019s what -- Basically, that\u2019s what helped me survive, also. In looking back, when we left my hometown Lida, in 1940, and went to Lvov, the reason why we went to Lvov, there were two-fold reasons, basically. One, that my mother and myself, we were able to get the Russian passports -- acceptable Russian passports. By that, meaning that our occupation -- my occupation became student and my mother\u2019s occupation becau -- became a working person, robotche. In spite the fact that we were Capitalists, according to the definition of USSR at that time. The reason why we picked Lvov, because I wanted to go to Vilna. But Vilna had not polytechnic institute. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 37 7 And Vilna got separated from Lida, because at that time, they made a separate country out of Lithuania. That would have meant crossing a border and difficulty in getting in touch with the family. So, we picked Lvov, where we could sort of disappear. Lvov, normally a city of 150,000, at that time had maybe 300,000, with all the refugees coming from Krakow, from Warsaw. It was on the Russian side of the divided Poland, from the -- after \u201839. And I was able to -- I was accepted to the non -- the pothip -- to the Polytechnic Institute. And that was my crutch, I figured I can -- I ha -- I have no other background -- I have nothing in my background that will allow me to make a living. I had to be on my own. Fortunately, the Russians were offering scholarships. Top students were getting a -- the -- a -- it\u2019s not a scholarship, a stipend -- a living allowance and coupons where you could buy things or you could purchase things. And I -- I have looked -- I have my -- the booklet where they have entered my grades and I have never anything -- I never had anything below a B -- what you would call B in here. Fact, I don\u2019t think I had any B\u2019s, I had all A\u2019s."

I don\u2019t -- I have -- I have it, because when I came back in \u201844, it was strange, but the Germans, during their occupations, they destroyed the Polish intelligentsia -- I mean, they killed the Polish professors. In fact, they did it before the killed the Jews, they killed the Polish -- the Polish professors in Lvov. But the-they -- Lvov itself was not bombed, was not destroyed.

However, she never became a citizen, because she had property in Poland and in order to hey -- to save the property, she had to be a Polish 37 10 citizen. When she came in 1938 to liquidate the property, the war broke up 1n thir -- broke out in \u201839. She had what she -- was called a re-entry permit for the United States, but not a citizenship. She did not want to become a citizen because she was married to citizen. So she had a re-entry permit, which was never honored by the Germans. She showed it to them, it did not help. You\u2019re Jewish no matter what. It didn\u2019t do any good. You\u2019re not an American citizen, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what counted. But she went -- when -- when we ended up, after th -- our odyssey, in Italy, she went to the American consul, I think it was in Rome. And he said, I cannot honor it, because you\u2019Il come to the States, you'll be a burden. Somebody has to send you an affidavit. If you -- you get an affidavit, together with a re-entry permit, you'll -- I\u2019ll issue you a -- a -- a permit -- a visa immediate -- not a visa, an entry visa, immediately. She had some friends in here that she- from before, they send her an affidavit and she left -- I\u2019m trying to think, it was late in \u201846, I think. In \u201846, or -- in the fall of 1946, she left for the United States and she was here. In the meantime, I was able to enroll myself, the tur -- University of tur -- Polytechnic Institute in Turin. And that was quite an odyssey also, cause Italian universities are quite strange. They don\u2019t accept you. In svite -- in spite the -- the fact that they gave me credit for this -- for a -- the -- Lvov Polytechnic Institute, they would not accept me unless I could show them th -- my original high school diploma. Of course, I didn\u2019t have it with me. The high school diploma was in Lvov. Lvov was in the Soviet Union. There was absolutely no way how I could get it. And then, I never thought, when I left Lvov, to go to the bursar and ask him gave me my high school diploma. They Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 37 11 wouldn\u2019t have given it to me anyway. I was able to find, through some friends, my last high school principal, from my home town. And because our graduating class was only 30-odd people, he did remember me. He was an official in the Ministry of Education. And he send me a document, which looked more official -- he asked me, \u201cWhat kind of grades do you want me to put on there?\u201d I said, \u201cPut whatever you want, I don\u2019t care, as long as I have the diploma.\u201d He says, \u201cI know that you passed, but I don\u2019t remember the grades.\u201d I said, \u201cPut anything you want.\u201d The document looked more official than the actual high school diploma.

In spite the fact that I heard it all around me, I didn\u2019t use it. And between ourselves, my friends, we spoke Polish. My mother and father -- I was only 10 years old when my father died, they spoke Russian between themselves. And it\u2019s strange, but my mother\u2019s friends, they spoke Russian between themselves also. The reason, because they grew up and they -- my mother was unusual for her generation. She had a high school diploma from Russia -- from Czarist Russia. And at that time, a high school diploma for a woman, it\u2019s like a Master\u2019s degree in college now.

I mean, now, we are going off on a tangent, you were asking me some o -- some other things, but we are going off on a -- on a tangent. When we were in hiding, and there were 11 of us, there was one man, my mother\u2019s age, roughly. There was an older woman by herself. There was my mother and myself, that\u2019s four. And then there was a Hashidisha family of seven. One of the men, that man that was there, my mother\u2019s age, he had a gun and I had a gun. After the Pole was arrested -- the man that was hiding us, he -- the Germans -- I mean there was a trial and all that and supposedly they had to confiscate all of his property and the people -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- the people that were actual -- that were removing the property from the basement and from the house, were the leftover Jews from the Yanoffska concentration camp. Remember, that was already -- that was early 1944. Ghetto was already liquidated, there was nothing in existence. In fact, I have a book by -- I forgot his first name, Wells, Villigeker, where he describes -- he 1s -- he was one of the people that was on Yanoffska Street at that time. He describes his 37 18 experiences and it\u2019s strange how he actually is telling me things that I -- that I -- that I have lived through. When they were removing the properties, that man could not take it any more, and we had to let him out. He went on the outside and he perished. He must have gotten caught. We survived. Now, the time when we were there, the experiences of hiding in that little hole and the relationship between the peoples, how we interacted, how we behaved toward each other, I wanted to write a play or write a book. I never had -- whenever I thought about it, I never had enough words. I cou -- I could not describe it, because it was absolutely unbelievable how the children were -- had a pillow ready to smother their old man because he was deaf and deaf people don\u2019t know how ca -- how loud they are. How the Germans were on one side of the wall and we were on the other side of the wall and we heard them hit and yell and -- and scream at the Jewish boys which were out there. We -- We assumed they were Jewish boys, cause we never saw them. And it\u2019s strange how the box that was hiding the entrance, to-together with that pole I have pa -- we have painted bricks on it, so it looked like bricks, that nobody noticed it? Or maybe somebody noticed it and deliberately ignored it to save our lives. We ne -- There are so many conflicts in there, so many possibilities, what actually happened? There -- I'll never know, and it\u2019s bothering me. I -- It\u2019s in my subconscious, but I still try to put it out -- out of my mind, because if you ask me the names of the people that were there, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember their last name, and I don\u2019t remember their first names. The man that got out, he was fr-from our hometown. Him, I remember, because I remember him from before. But otherwise, the names -- it\u2019s sort of 37 19 fu-fuzzy in my mind. The details are there, I can visualize it, but I don\u2019t feel that I have enough words to describe it. Now, to go back to my chutzpah. When I went to the consul- to the American consul in Genoa, cause from Turin, you had to go to Genoa, and I showed them that I was accepted at the University of Illinois and that was beginning of February, of \u201848. He says to me, \u201cWhen does the semester start?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, they accepted me.\u201d\u2019 He made some quick checks, he says, \u201cYou know, the semester has already started. If you go by boat, you have no reservations, you have no -- no way how to get there for at least a month. I will not give you the visa now.\u201d So I asked him, \u201cWhat about if I fly?\u201d He said, \u201cDll give you the visa immediately.\u201d So I went back to the AJDC and I said to them, \u201cI have a commitment from the American consul.\u201d"

Like a major attraction in New York at the time. I spent on Ellis Island, Saturday and Sunday. Monday morning they called University of Illinois and they apologized to me and they let me out.

To marry, they had to get a permission from a rabbi, because they were relat -- they never had any -- they never had any children anyway, so it didn\u2019t matter. He was a chemical engineer, a very able chemical engineer, who built one of the major rubber factories in Poland and got pushed out by other people who sort of took it over. Then he went abroad and built a factory, I think, a rubber factory in Greece, a rubber factory in France. He had a French ler -- French degree, a degree from Toulouse, I think. Eventually, he settled in my -- on our hometown, and he and -- with his brother, made -- b-built a factory where they used to make rubber heels for shoes. In spite the fact that factory was small and basically the two of -- I don\u2019t know how many they employed, but owning a factory made them Capitalists. So when the Russians came in, the thing got nationalized and they had to escape. They went to Vilna and they were one of the 8,000 that got the visas from 37 23 the Japanese c-consul in Kovno. I think you heard of -- I forgot his name. They ended up in Japan, in -- rather in Shanghai, but because they were skilled -- they were both engineers, Canada accepted them. So they ended up in \u201840 -- in the early 40\u2019s, they ended up in Canada. From Canada, they came to the States. My aunt was left in Lida to liquidate the property. She was selling whatev -- whatever they had 1n the -- in the house. The furniture, the clothe -- pardon me, the clothing, and all the other things. So then when they -- Russia closed the border with Lithuania, they had to cross the border to go into Vilna. The husband was still there and she and a number of other peoples got caught on the border -- the border, arrested by the KGB. Within two days or three days, there was a trial and they were sentenced to deportation to Kazakstan, which 1n a -- the long run, saved her life. In fact, his father -- my uncle\u2019s father -- father was arrested not at the same time, but arrested also and sent to the same area of Kazakstan, and my aunt was there with his fa -- with her father-in-law, who died there.

They had an apartment on Newkirk Avenue, in a building which is basically -- last time I saw it, it was abandoned. It was a four story walk-up. Newkirk and East 21st Street. And my mother got a room out there, with them. I think 1t was a two bedroom or a three bedroom apartment, on the top floor."

I met him -- When we came to Lvov, from Lida, in 1940, Lvov was overpopulated. From 150, became 300,000. We couldn\u2019t find a place where to live. So we finally found a -- an apart -- a -- a small apartment on the outskirts of Lvov. He rented it to us, I don\u2019t know why. Because he was -- he knew that we were Jewish. He knew exactly what was happening, but I have maybe developed a rapport with him. On the beginning, I have -- I don\u2019t say that I did help him, but I have showed some understanding in the things that he was doing. He was a builder, a -- a contractor. At that time, he was already in his 60\u2019s. And I have expressed my admiration at that time Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 37 40 for the Polish leaders from the 30\u2019s, like Marshall Pilsiltski. And he was a great lover of Pilsiltski, a great admirer. We have developed, sort of like a friendship, so that when I -- we le -- when we found an apartment in Lvov later and we left him, I still kept in touch -- in touch with him. I used to go out there, walk that kilometer from the last trolley stop to his shop and sort of discuss politics with him. What\u2019s going on in London, with the Polish government in London. What\u2019s going on in the world. So when we -- when the ghetto became a dead end and my mother, after she came back from being 1n hiding -- after the Germans caught her on the way back -- they beat her up, they told her to dig her grave, and because a German patrol brought out other woman -- I think I have described that part -- a-another woman and that woman was shot, the -- the -- the -- the SS man let her go and she came ba -- she came back to the ghetto, I saw -- I went ba -- I was abl -- I was working outside the ghetto, so I skipped my -- from my -- from my job -- from my pa -- from whatever we were doing. I -- I removed the arm band and I went to talk to him, would he accept -- would he accept my mother to go in hiding? Because we were old friends, I would call it, he said, \u201cLet me think about it. Pll give you an answer.\u201d And eventually, on the second trip, he did accept her. I smuggled her out -- out of the ghetto with my wa -- w-with my ma -- w-w-with my work detachment, what you would call it, that we used to work outside the ghetto -- outside the ghetto walls. I -- I got her there -- I came back to the ghetto, but when I got out of the ghetto, I went with the Polish underground, with the -- with the Akar, with the army of Cryova. And when I found that they were so hostile to me that I -- I ga -- I wouldn\u2019t survive with them, I went to him to 37 41 let me in, and he did. Maybe he took advantage of me at the time, because I was able to help him. He had, at that time already, grenades, rifles, ammunition, a short wave radio receiver and transmitter, where he was communitcating with the -- the -- the Akar, the army of Cryova, he was like a center post -- center point, where the army of Cr-Cryova was -- was commu-communicating through him. He was one of many. On -- On the other hand, he was with an anti-Semitic group and he was still hiding two Jews. Two Jews that were paying him to be there, but in order to be able to convert, with what -- my mother was paying him with gold coins, with American dollars. There\u2019s what -- do -- they were of no value unless you could -- could convert them into the current currency. And in -- in order convert it into currency -- he didn\u2019t trust anyone in Lvov. He used to go to the walls of ghetto, communicate with this man that eventually came into hiding with us, that did not survive. Through him, he got another woman and another family of seven that we didn\u2019t know about. My mother and I didn\u2019t know about them. When I came back to my mother, we saw stranger -- we heard strange noises and strange shadows in the middle of the night and we confronted him and then he put us all together. The -- The reason why we saw those shadows and so on, because they had to go to the bathroom -- to dispose of their body waste. We had to go to dispose of the body waste into a cesspool or something of that sort. Or get water from the -- from the di -- from the well that he had in the ba -- in- in his basement. But they -- the part that a being -- he said, \u201cI was saving u -- I was saving human beings. I am not a Jew lover, I don\u2019t like Jews.\u201d And they used to say, \u201cBut you like money.\u201d So he says, \u201cMoney does -- did na -- money doesn\u2019t do any harm. But 37 42 think what I -- what I am risking with.\u201d And eventually, through -- I think through triangulation, they found his radio receiver, transmitter, from -- the Germans. They came, they discovered the arms, they discovered the -- everything, but they never discovered the Jews. We have camouflaged ourselves in such a way that they couldn\u2019t find us. And who built? I built it with him, because the Hasidisha family of seven wa -- th -- they -- they -- they didn\u2019t have to lay a brick, they couldn\u2019t do anything. They were praying all day long."

Besides running that division, I did design of e- environmental testing equipment, which was a very challenging subject. United States used to send up satellites and rockets into space, which used to come with all kinds of data. What are the conditions in outer space? We were designing equipment that would simulate the change and the condition in the outer space. So, for example, if a rocket, equipped with electronic equipment, would be sent up, you start with ground conditions. While it\u2019s going up, because of skin friction with air, the temperature can build up to a couple of hundred degrees on the -- on the surface. But the pressure -- the va -- will change and it will come up to almost absolute vacuum. But then we found out that it isn\u2019t so, that there is a Van Allen belt, or actually the vacuum from a high vacuum, it -- it changes and there 1s a little more ionization in there. So we had to simulate it in a 37 57 chamber. So when people were building their electronic equipment, or their products, they could actually put it into a chamber and the chamber would sa -- would simulate -- not the fl -- the flight, but the ca -- the -- the changing conditions. So we knew -- th-those were all classified data, so we knew what -- what 1s going on, how the -- how the conditions progress.

The Russians and the Germans had a major artiller -- artillery duel and all of downtown, which used to be Jewish, of course, like in all tow -- little towns, was completely destroyed, it does not exist. It\u2019s a field now. When the Russians came, they built a housing complex, they didn\u2019t know where. It turned out they built it over a Jewish cemetery.

Another friend of mine used to -- ha -- owned a bakery, coffee shop -- I don\u2019t -- cafe, where you could go in the back, have a cup of -- cup of coffee and pastry and even dancing the -- in the afternoon. There was an orchestra of a father and son. The son used to play the accordion. That son saved himself, ended up in the USO of the Russian army. And I 37 715 bumped into him on the market in Lvov. I looked at him, he looked at me, I said, \u201cI know you.\u201d And he says, \u201cI know you, too.\u201d Said, \u201cAre you,\u201d and I mentioned his name and he said, \u201cYeah.\u201d I says and he recognized me too. You know, it was just a few years, but a few years of tough a life. He said he was just coming from that front. He went through Deeta, there was absolutely nothing left. There is nobody left. He told me who survived. My family, completely wiped out, completely disappeared. There is absolutely nobody from my family. So I didn\u2019t go there. My mother said to me, \u201cWhat are you going to go for?\u201d Later -- Later I found out something very tragic and very disturbing. My grandparents were quite wealthy. They were banished from my town to a small place, because it was too close to the border, so the Russians banished them and they had to move out from there. But once the ghetto started, they were able to move back. And they had quite a bundle of dollars, gold, jewelry, gold coins. So they buried it somewhere. They were killed on the beginning, because the Germans procedure, what you called, was to get rid of the old ones first. Kill the old ones first and the very young ones, the babies. Get as much as you can out of the middle age and young and exterminate them in the -- in the -- the way -- the way they did it. By hunger, starvation, sickness or whatever th -- whatever they did. My aunt -- My -- The youngest sister, my mother\u2019s youngest sister, the youngest one in the family. She married and they had a little girl. The girl at that time was about six or seven years old. They knew where the stuff was buried. They were in the ghetto and my aunt\u2019s husband, my uncle, was an accountant, a very able man, extremely able man. Very, very, very a -- from a poor family, what you would call. He married into a rich family, but believe me, he was extremely able and -- and they got a bargain.

Political discussions, what\u2019s going on 1n the world. They were talking about the situation -- about -- or the rise of Hitler. The rise -- What\u2019s going on in France, what\u2019s going on in England. About the Soviet Union, about Stalin\u2019s purges. This had to leave some sort of a re-residue in -- in my mind.
