And we were farmers, just like anybody else in Nieder-ohmen. There was never any difference; we were Jewish, but we didn't feel it. We were Germans first. Jews were secondary -- nobody bothered with this religion. And since my father was a veteran of World War I, he was very well liked. Very well liked. And whenever someone had a problem in Nieder-ohmen, my father was sure to solve it. We called him later on the Kissinger\u2019 of Nieder-ohmen."

She always has been, and as we grew older, she sort of looked for guidance towards us, to my sister and me. And we became sort of like three sisters. She was quite young, she was still our mother. I mean I wouldn't say when it came to disciplining us, she was the head of the house. She knew just what to do, but basically we grew up together with our mother."

We didn't have a toilet inside, so the dog was right next to the outhouse. So every time we went there or stayed there a little while, the dog would scratch on the door. \u201cIt's enough already, come on out.\u201d So the dog was part of our family, we loved him.

            "answer": "Well, I had lots of German friends. I had little kids who played with me, and went to school with me and we were -- sometimes one of my friends would go with me to synagogue, and I went with her to church. My mother told me I shouldn't kneel down because that's not in my religion, so I didn't. Nobody bothered, I don't even think they did kneel down. Because I was always told, I remember that from way back. But, but I went to church Sundays and she went to synagogue on Saturdays. We were really close friends, and she's still alive. And she was happy that I did that for her, and I was happy to have her. I never wanted to let her go, why let her go on Saturdays and why would she let me go on Sundays, you know? But it changed, it changed in 1933. It changed a lot. This particular friend didn't change too much, but I had one girl which really was my idol. She was extremely intelligent, and she was a little redhead and she was very cute. And we played together, and at one point she said to me, \"You know, Carola, I can't play with you anymore.\" And I said, \"How come?\" She said, \"Because you're a Jew.\" I said, \"What is that?\" She said, \"Well, have you heard of Hitler?\" I said, \"Yes, because every morning they used to say Heil Hitler. And,, but why can't you play with me anymore? Why?\" She said, \"Because my father told me that you're Jewish, and Gentile children, Aryan kids can no longer play with the Jewish kids.\" And her father had gone to school with my mother, and they were the best of friends. And that was very, very hard for an eight-year-old, you know. It felt very strange that suddenly -- and then the whole group disappeared. Nobody would play with a Jewish child anymore. So then we sort of -- to the Jewish kids, we were friendly with the Jewish kids, too. So then we were all Jewish kids, and we stuck to one another."

            "answer": "Felt there was something -- I was different. And I couldn't, and I couldn't understand why I was different. Well, I was asked before by someone why was I different. Did I feel any different? You know, we did speak Hochdeutsch\u2019, which is the better German. So did that girl, this Lucy, Lucy, really, she spoke Hochdeutsch. Only the farmers had a dialect, and we never did have a dialect. So I felt was that the difference? No, it wasn't the difference, because the teacher spoke Hochdeutsch and so did the pastor of the village, speak Hochdeutsch. So we were -- I was very upset that suddenly they would make such a difference and make us feel like outcasts, and it got worse and worse. It was just -- that was only the beginning."

            "question": "Did it affect school right away?",
            "answer": "Yes. Not right away, because we were pretty good students, especially my sister was an excellent student. So the teachers couldn't right away throw us out of school because we sort of held the school together. But there was a time where it was impossible, it was only Heil Hitler and there were these songs which I really can't translate. But in German it was \u2018\u201cWenn\u2019s Judenblut vom Messer spritzt\u2019.\u201d Jewish blood runs off the knives, then we feel better. Just songs like that, and we felt very, very, very bad. We were little kids and yet when we looked around and we seen the BDM\u2019, that's a circle of German girls who had these nice outings, we felt so why can't we be part of it? Why can't we? As a matter of fact, I remember at one point when I walked through the schoolyard -- we lived right next to the schoolyard -- everybody said, \"Heil, Hitler\" like this. I did, too. What did I know? I was eight years old. So my mother said to me, \"You're not supposed to do that.\" I said, \"Why not?\" She said, \"Haven't you been told that you are Jewish?\" I said, \"Oh, I forgot.\" So it was very hard to comprehend. I couldn't get it together that I was suddenly Jewish and I couldn't do whatever I did before. * Standard German (German) \u00b0 When the blood of the Jews sprays from the knife (German). * Bund Deutscher Madel [League of German Girls] (German); branch of Hitler Youth.

            "answer": "It was very frightening, and, especially for an eight-year-old child. If you're older, you understand. But it got worse and worse, and by the age of 11, my parents decided that they couldn't leave me in school anymore. Neither myself nor my sister, and they would send me to a Jewish school. In the meantime they had made Jewish schools all over Germany where only Jewish kids went. And so, therefore, I went to Bad Nauheim, which was Bad Nauheim Bezirkschule\u2019 in the district of the area where some of the children came by bus and some of them stayed in the dorm. And I was sent into the dorm. I was very homesick, and my mother and father had a hard time getting me there, but once I was there I was fine. And my sister went -- went,, she's a year older -- she skipping already, I don't know, in one grade here and there, went straight to a teacher's seminary to Wurzburg. That was a teacher's seminary, so she went there and I went to Bad Nauheim."

I, I made believe like she was 100 years older, and I would say to her, \"So, what's going to happen to us?\" She says, \"Nothing. I don't know why you're worried. It's going to be all right. Don't worry about it. We'll live, we'll survive.\" So I figured if she said so, I'll probably survive and went on with that thought."

And you're a young girl, and they're not going to kill you. Don't worry about it, you'll be fine. You'll absolutely fine. Hitler will disappear one of these days, and you're going to be okay. Just hold out, don't let them make you crazy. Be strong.\" And he had all these quotations from Schiller\u00ae and Goethe\u2019 and all kinds of things telling me that never do anything wrong. \u201cRather suffer, but don't do anything wrong.\u201d Which in German is, \u201cLieber Unrecht Leiden als tun.*\u201d And he left me with all kinds of legacies, and I really, I, I lived through this on my life. I listened to ... he \u00b0 District school (German) \u00b0 (Johann Christoph) Friedrich von Schiller \u2019 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe * Better to suffer injustice than to cause it (German). was a very bright man. And,, at least of everybody feels their father's superior, but he had a strong mind. And he kept saying that definitely we'll get through that easily, and we don't have to go to America. We can stay in Germany, not to worry. So what was I supposed to do? I said \u201cokay.\u201d Little did he know what was in store for him."

And, we had an aunt, you know, my father had this retarded sister. And he wasn't going to let her go, just abandon her. So he said, \"Maybe I ought to send the children,\" my sister and myself. But then he said, \"But my kids want to be with me.\" And we really wanted to be with them, and he said, \"It will be okay.\" But in the meantime, they took the retarded sister into a home to Berlin away from us. And my father was taken to a labor camp, and well, on the 10th of November, you know, he was taken to Buchenwald. And my mother came to, to Bad Nauheim where I was.

We were just people like anybody else until we had to wear the star. So we lived together with our grandparents and it was okay. And, my sister worked, she had to do some, also, some slave labor work in Frankfurt. I don't recall what she did, but I went to school yet because I was still young -- younger. I went to Philanthropin and I took a course in medicine. I took a course in sewing, and I sort of was preparing myself for America. Learned how to speak English.

And I remember in 1939 when German soldiers came back to Germany from Poland, and they used to say, \"They're taking the Polish Jews and they shoot them right outside.\" And my father would say, \u201cthat guy never told the truth, it's not so. I'm sure it's not.\u201d He denied it. He really denied it, he thought that couldn't happen. Germans were not bad people. It was, you know, they were educated mostly from birth.

My grandfather used to go and buy things, but we were always rationed. My grandmother was always afraid that I would eat too much.

If they would have left us alone, we could have survived there during the war. It was livable. So, of course, food was scarce, but at that time they had occupied Italy. They brought watermelons, and we had enough potatoes, so we made potatoes and we fried them with nothing. Made potato pancakes and watermelons and we got a little bread, and we got by.

Just do what they tell you and you'll be okay.\" And I figured she really meant well with me, and I did what she said. I didn't say one word, and I told my friends, \"Just let's keep still and do what they tell us to do.\" And they really didn't do us any harm except for someone who made a big to-do about it. I don't want my hair cut. Why should you? Some of the women were married to Gentiles, and they said, \"My husband is an Aryan. Why should you cut my hair?\" And that would get those girls who had been there for several years already extremely angry. They kept saying, \"But you are a Jew. So, therefore, we have to cut your hair and shut up.\" So there was always some sort of an argument with cutting of the hair."

            "answer": "Now, we were assigned to a block. I think it was Block 13 I was in. We were all the girls, not all of the girls who came at the same transport. So we were more or less together, and we * Political (German) were put on -- so we had what we call a Koje.\u201d You know what a Koje is? A Koje is like a board. There was one on the bottom; there was one on the top, and I think there was a third one. We had no straw, we had no blankets, we had nothing and it was February. They took away our clothes, but I do remember they left me with my shoes. And I was a kid, I didn't know -- I had shoes, very simple shoes on. I was in Auschwitz three days and the soles had separated from the top. So I found a rag someplace and tied them together. It was quite a few weeks I walked barefoot in February. It was very cold. There was snow on the ground. I put all kinds of -- whatever I could find on my feet just to stay warm. And so they did put us into the barracks. And then every morning we had zahlappell** which is the roll call, and there was usually SS men or SS women that came. We stood there sometimes for hours in the freezing cold, so some of the girls already died right then and there because it was impossible. Couldn't take that. Food, we hardly got. And really, I mean, they were falling down left and right. So standing there -- then, one of the SS men would come and make a selection, and most of the time that was Mengele. And he would go to say -- he didn't like the face, he didn't like what you looked like, and he says, \"Come on out. Come on out. Come on out.\" So I remember that so well. You know, I was brought up very religious, and the prayer you say when you die is \u201cShema Israel~\u2019,\u201d so every time he came around, I would just stand there and say my prayer. And luckily I was never taken. And I used to tell my friends, \"Do what I'm doing.\" I was such a religious person. Well, it worked for me, it didn't work for everybody. So it went on for weeks and weeks. We marched out in the morning. We went to build barracks out in Auschwitz, and then the SS men came with their dogs. And if they didn't like you -- but who you -- liked you? You looked like an animal. They would just say, \"Go, run after her. Go ahead and take the dog.\" The dog would bite you. I have a few bites on my legs. And, you know, by then you were already every day you looked skinnier and skinnier. There was nothing left of you anymore, and then suddenly I noticed I was getting typhoid. I started to -- couldn't control my bowel movements anymore, and I felt this is it. I'll probably lay down like the rest of them. By then most of the girls had already -- the first four weeks were the worst, and I probably won't be able to make this. But then I remember my father said not to give in. \u201cYou've got to be strong.\u201d And at night I used to hallucinate and, you know, there was no Schindler \u2019, no Schindler's list or anything. If anyone would help you, it was the girl who laid next to you. She would say, \"Here, look, I give you a piece of rag to clean yourself off, and I'll take your bread.\" Well, I much rather gave her the bread, clean \u00b0\u00b0 Bunk (German) * Roll call count (German) > Hear, O Israel (Hebrew); declaration of God\u2019s unity and watchword of Jewish faith. \u00b0 Oskar Schindler myself off, and be okay the next day. But it was horrible, I screamed for my mother, my father. There was nobody. I was a young girl, I just felt somebody should listen to me. I really would say the first four weeks, if you held out the first four or six weeks, you were okay. I think I did, I held out those weeks."

            "answer": "Yeah, right away. Right away. The first four weeks, I was doing that kind of work and that was the time when I started having typhoid. I was so sick, so sick. And I went -- in Auschwitz, there was this so-called LagerstraBe,\u201d\u2019 the street. And there was the LagerstraBe where our barrack was, and I -- it was close to the kitchen. And I walked to the kitchen, and I found some coal on the floor. And I always heard that coal will stuff you up if you eat coal. And I had a little bit of medical knowledge, not too much. Coal will stuff you up. No matter what, what could have happened? I found a piece of coal in the kitchen and I ate the coal, and I found a piece of lemon peel near the kitchen and I took the piece of lemon peel in my pocket. I ate the piece of coal. And water we didn't have, but we had the snow on the ground. And I ate the snow, and I swallowed that and I got better. And every time when I felt faint, and I had that piece of lemon peel in my pocket for all the years I\u2019ve been in Auschwitz, and every time I felt faint, I took that lemon peel. And, you know, there's always a little something coming out yet -- no matter how long you have a lemon peel in your pocket -- and I could smell it, and I felt like -- relieved. So the lemon peel and the coal got me out of my dilemma. And then one day, they were taking all the so-called fryz] erkas~* which I didn't know at the time what that meant, to Auschwitz. And they needed new ones in Birkenau. I didn't know what that meant, and they had selected already about six; they needed a seventh. And this girl, Sheyna was her name, stood next to me, and she said to me, \"Pick up your arm.\" And I said, \"Now I\u2019m not -- what is a fryzjerka anyway?\" She says, \"A fryzjerka is a beautician.\" And I said, \"But I'm not a beautician. I, I don't know how to do hair. I can't do 7 Camp street (German) *> Hair dresser (Polish) that for the SS women.\" She said, \"Oh, keep quiet. Just give them your number.\" So she took my hand, and she said, \"37468, she's the seventh fryzjerka. \u201c So the girl in charge took my number down and that made me the fryzjerka, which is a beautician, but I didn't have to do the SS women. All I did was cutting the hair of the people who came in the same way they had done to us. Now, that was a very devastating experience, since lots of transports came in and lots of friends of mine came and I had to cut their hair. And I kept telling them, like Zippy had done previously to me, \"Do what they tell you and don't make noise.\" And I did tell them, and their hair was cut and I did that for quiet some time. That somehow made my life a little better since it was indoors. Then after a while, they replaced us again with other girls."

For a Yiddish-speaking person, the German is like a distorted Yiddish, but for a German- speaking person, Yiddish is a distorted German. So I, that's when I learned how to speak Yiddish, too.

So while I was working in the sauna and doing the entlausen\u2019\u2019, disinfection, they asked me to go to the crematorium and get some blue gas. Whether they needed that for the clothes or they needed it to wash the people off to take lice away and entlausen -- I don't recall. All I recall 1s that I went, of course, not alone. There was an SS woman walking with me to the gas chambers. I was supposed to get two bottles of Zyklon B\u2019\u2019, or whatever they called it. A liquid gas. And, I went, and this lady went with me with her gun, of course. And I asked the Sonderkommando\u2019\u2019, the man, to get me what I was supposed to get. So he opened the wrong door. He must have opened the wrong door. I just stood there, and I seen these people piled into the gas chambers. Not saying a word, they were all dead. They were all piled in there. They couldn't even fall down because they pushed them all in there, and I just looked and I said, \"This is impossible.\" Of course, I had known all along that was happening, but to see 1S to believe it. And then I came back to the sauna. I never told anybody. I was so horrified, I didn't want other girls to feel bad and get nightmares. I had them. You see grownups with children and everything, yet standing up. They were not taken out yet, and they were not gassed. They were not burned yet, so quickly he closed the door. He was very embarrassed that he opened the wrong door, and this SS woman escorted me back into the camp. And, like I said, I never told anybody until a few years ago I was interviewed by someone and then it took me a long time to even talk about it. That was the experience I had with the gas chambers."

            "question": "And she didn't care that you had seen it?",
            "answer": "No. Nothing. It was okay. As a matter of fact, you know, the SS women -- all the transports came from Poland, from Czechoslovakia, from Greece, from Italy. Everybody brought beautiful clothes and I had been working in the sauna. I had to put this stuff into the machines. They used to say, \"Well, this is nothing. Just wait till the American people come. When we get the clothing of the American Jews, then we really have clothes.\" So, obviously, they were very sure of themselves that the American Jews will eventually end up in the gas chambers, too. So that was my experience with the gas chambers in Auschwitz. , what I wanted to say, by that time, you know, in Auschwitz most of our girls who had come with me from Berlin had already died except for one. She was a young girl, she was 19; I was 17. By then maybe she was 20 and I was 18. I passed -- I walked in the LagerstraBe and I seen her laying there, and I said to her, \"What's the matter?\" She says, \"Well, I'm going to die. I can't hold out.\" But she says, \"You're a young girl. You're going to --\" She says, \"You're going to make it, ... and I want you to tell the world what they did to us.\" And I held her in my arms and she died. And I said the \u201cShema\u2019\u2019,\u201d that was the right thing for me to do and I walked away. It was an everyday happening in Auschwitz, you just seen your friends on the street and dying. She was a very nice girl, and I really felt that she was going to make it, but there was no way. People could not endure all the stress and all the strain and no food and wintertime. *> American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors (Washington, DC) *\u201d See \u201cShema Israel.\u201d That was a very, very bad experience for me. That was something that I will never forget. I had known this girl from childhood on. And even today sometimes I see a woman, an older woman, who -- she was very short -- and I look at her and I say, \"She probably would have looked like--\" Bertel was her name -- \"she probably would have looked like that today.\" She would have been an old lady by now, but at that time she was 19 years old, beautiful and everything. Couldn't make it, no chance. And so by then all, most of the girls from Berlin had passed away, had been killed, or had been shot, or didn't want to live anymore. And we were just with the girls who were there, and we again made close ties with each and every one because everybody had one reason; that was to survive. Stick to one another and survive. And there was one thing I must say. Somebody in Auschwitz, and I think they must be from Czechoslovakia, maybe from Poland by the name of Carola Stern, and that person must have died. And she got some sardines from the Red Cross from Switzerland, and she was no longer there, so they gave it to me. This was the most fortunate thing I had, so I had about four cans of sardines, and I could buy myself, you know, a piece of bread or something like that. They also gave us a piece of salami, like once a week. And being that I was so Orthodox, I wasn't going to eat it, I exchanged it for bread. Later on I found out that I didn't have to do that, I could have eaten it. But that was my religion which wouldn't allow me to eat any unkosher food, even in Auschwitz."

He had the dogs shovel them out. The dogs captured them and they shoveled them out. They wanted to escape, go back to Germany. That was about the only thing where I was a witness of -- I helped them shovel in there. I -- we kept saying, \"Don't do that, don't do that.\" They said, \"Yes, yes, yes, yes.\" So we did. * Adolf Taube *\u00b0 Counter (German)"

Their sisters or brothers or whatever they had, they were already dead. They were the pioneers of Auschwitz, and they were treated like dirt. Like dirt. So everybody was out to live, you know. We all wanted to live, and we tried very hard to make the best of it. So when the other so-called Zugange\u201d inmates came into Auschwitz, they may have been harsh at times. Yeah, I've seen that quite often. Like I said before, when someone says, \"Well, I don't get my hair cut because my husband is Aryan,\" and so on, they would say, \"You're just as much of a Jew as Iam. Who do you think you are?\" They would get nasty with words, but never -- I mean, I have never experienced anything like hitting or kicking or something like that. I've heard some people say that, but it was -- where I worked it wasn't like that. As a matter of fact, the girls who worked with me in the sauna some of them are still alive and have been really very good to me. They have called me. They live in Israel. And, as a matter of fact, one was here in America. She's now a widow, and she came here and she asked me whether I was happy with my marriage and I said, \"Yes, I am.\" I said, \"Why would you ask me?\" She says, \"Because I have enough. We could both live in Israel together because I would take you with * New comers (German) me.\" I thought that was very, very nice. I said, \"No, thank you.\""

I personally haven't seen it, but I have heard from plenty of people who said they were nasty. They weren't nice.

When the transports from Lodz came into Auschwitz, I thought -- that was in June -- no, that was in August 1944, I thought that my parents would be still alive. And I said to myself, \u201cNothing can happen to me anymore. If I see the Obersturmfthrer\u201d -- and I forgot his name \u2014 \u201cI would go to him and I'll ask him if he can bring my parents into the camp, provided they are still living.\u201d So as I walked on the street in Auschwitz, I see this Obersturmfthrer walking, and I went over to him. And then -- we were talking about how do you address an officer -- I went over to him, clicked my heels, and said, \"Herr Obersturmfthrer, sieben und dreising vier acht und sechzig, meldet sich.\"\u201d! Which means \"37468 makes herself known.\" He says, \"What do you want?\" with a very stern voice. And he said, \"And how come you speak German?\" I said, \"I'm from Frankfurt,\" which I really wasn't, but Nieder-ohmen, nobody would have ever known. I said, \"Well, I was born in Germany, and I wanted to ask you something. Do you go to the ramp to get the people from the Lodzer ghetto?\" He said, \"Yah, yah.\" \u201cYes,\u201d he says, \"why would that interest you?\" I said, \"Because my parents have been in the L\u00e9dzer ghetto since 1941, and since the transports are coming now into Auschwitz, I would like to ask you if it's okay with you, sir, to bring my parents into the camp. I'm here two years, and if that's possible, please do that.\" So he looked at me like I was nuts, like chutzpa of a young girl. And he said, \"Your parents, where are they?\" *\u00b0 should grow like an onion with your head in the ground (Yiddish). >! Mr. Lieutenant Colonel, 37468 reporting (German). I said, \"Well, in Litzmannstadt.\" He said, \"Well, no, you can't go. But if you know of a man who can -- if you know of a man, he can go.\" So I knew this man by the name of Bumeck Stern, same name as mine. And I knew him, and I said, \"Yes, I do, and if the officer allows me to, I will get him.\" And he took this young man to the ramp and this Bumak called out the names of my parents and my sister, and they weren't there anymore. There was no, no response. So he came back into the camp. Occasionally, he would come into the camp. He wasn't in my camp, you know, and he said, \"There was no response. I don't think your sister, nor your parents are alive.\" So I had to deal with that, I figured \u201cthat's it.\u201d And then transports still came in..."

            "answer": "I, I, didn't give up. I thought maybe the next transport. We didn't go to every transport, maybe the next transport. So I, I didn't give up. And in July -- in August 1944, another big transport came from Lodz, Litzmannstadt and I walked through the sauna thinking that if my mother -- my father wouldn't have been there anyway -- and my sister would be there, I would just see them. My mother at that time was still a young woman. Maybe she was 41, 42 years old, and she was tiny. She looked tiny. And I walked through the aisles where people the came in and their head -- their hair was already shaven, I think so. They already had -- no, they didn't have a number on their arm yet. They were about to be bathed or whatever, showered. And as I walked through the rows, through the aisle there, I hear a tiny voice say, \"Carola.\" And I turned around. It was my sister. And the reason she recognized me, it's a very interesting story. When I as a child, I had a way of bending my arm completely back, and I walked like this. She knows, I really don't know. She seen a woman walking, a girl walking with the arm like that, and she said to her -- a girl was standing next to her, \"This is my sister.\" She says, \"What are you talking about? This couldn't be your sister.\" \"I noticed the arm,\" she said. And, and when I turned around after she called, \"Carola,\" it was my sister. And we hugged ** Irma Grese > Josef Kramer and I wanted to know what happened to my parents, and she said they were all dead. And that's where Grese was, Grese, \u201cthe Beast of Bergen-Belsen.\u201d She witnessed this thing, she seen me speaking to my sister and hugging my sister. And she stood there and cried. Something nobody had ever seen before, and then she said to me, \"Carola,\" she heard my sister call \"Carola\"; otherwise, she wouldn't have known. She said, \"You don't have to worry. Your sister is going to stay with you now.\" And we hugged again, at least we are together. And whatever happens, we are together. And she said, \"Okay, there is nothing to worry about. Your sister is going to be with you.\" So I was trying to hold on to my sister, but she had to go through all kinds of different routines. Having, being tattooed. She was tattooed on the inside because I felt that she didn't have to have -- in case she would survive, she has a tiny little tattoo. And I thought we would be together, but 1t was just a false promise. They sent her to a different camp, and I didn't know where she went. And once in a while, one of my friends who went around -- my friend, Claire,, one of the Frankfurt girls, she would go to the camp where she was in. And she would come back, and she says, \"Your sister is still alive. Your sister 1s still alive.\" She was in a different camp, and, I would hear from her once in a while. \"Not to worry, I'm still living.\" And I had hoped that maybe, you know, maybe the Russians would come and we would, we would be free again, and we would get together. But there was little hope, very little hope that we would be together. So it went on,, the march that was in 1944 in, in August. 1945 in January, the big march from Auschwitz started, and I didn't know where my sister was. I didn't know what was happening. She was already so tiny and so skinny, I was afraid that she, she would be killed. She would have been killed already then. So we marched out of Auschwitz day and night, and late night and day. And we were in cattle cars and we went to Ravensbriick. And in Ravensbriick we stayed four weeks, and I had no -- no sight of my sister. I didn't know where she was. We marched out of Ravensbriick, and from Ravensbriick we went supposedly to Malchow. We did go to Malchow, there was another march from Ravensbriick to Malchow day and night, day and night. And I was already so weak, and we all were. One helped me on one side, the other on the other side, and we slept walking. And that's how we went on, and whoever didn't do it lay down and they shot them. They didn't give them any chance; they shot the girls just night then and there. So at one point I had to go to the bathroom. I didn't know what to do. And I went out of my line and there was no bathroom, but there was barn. So I went into the barn. I said to the girls, \"I have to go to the bathroom, it's impossible.\" I went to the barn, I walked into barn. My sister walked out of the barn. And so I said, \"Now, you're not going to be out of my sight anymore. You're going to be with me.\" And we did cling to each and she walked with me. And everybody thought she was my little sister because she's small. And we stayed together from that day on \u2018til we were in Malchow, we stayed together. We were never separated anymore. So that was one good thing that I had to the bathroom. That was a very unusual incident. So from the march on, we marched into Malchow. That was the camp where we hardly got any salt in anything. But I had a chance to work in their kitchen, and in the kitchen what I did there is I did heat the kettles the to make the fire underneath, you know. So what we really -- what the girls cooked there was water, potato peels, and a little bit of farina. Not farina, oatmeal. And that made sort of a soup, but it was better than nothing. So at least I had a little soup I could give my sister and my friends, Claire, who was with me and Martha. Two of the girls from Frankfurt survived with me. We were together, and I had a chance to give them a little extra soup. I added a little hot water and it was good. But we got thinner and thinner every day because they took away the salt. But that's where we laid around, and that's where we talked to the Gypsies and we talked about food and talked about better times which we felt we will never see. And across from us was a camp with English prisoners, and they looked just as bad as we did. It was just across from the camp we were in. They were also laying around, like, you know, like, like dead animals. You know, when you go to a zoo and sometimes and those animals look like tranquilized, that's what we all looked like. We were just either waiting to die or being liberated. Something had to happen to us, we couldn't go on anymore. And then that was in February, and we talked about that maybe we're getting liberated. Maybe the Russians were coming closer, but we had no newspaper. Nobody knew anything. All of a sudden at the beginning of May, the Nazis, the SS came running in and they kept screaming, \"Get out of here you dirty Jews. Get out of here. Let's go. Walk.\" Now, we figured \u201cwhere are we walking now?\u201c We could hardly move anymore. They walked us into the woods. We were so sure that in the woods they were going to shoot us. Because it was coming closer, the war was getting -- coming to an end, we felt. And why in the woods? So they marched us into the woods, and all of a sudden in the woods -- it was, I think it was May the 3rd, or was it -- maybe it was a different -- maybe May the 8th. I think it was May the 3rd. They all disappeared, there were no Nazi uniforms. They were either they had their private uniform, their clothes in a package. The SS men disappeared; there were none. And all of a sudden we see a tank with three young American soldiers screaming from the top of their lungs, \"You guys are free. Hitler 1s dead. You're free, you're free.\" And they had -- I remember they had chocolate. There was a quite a few of us. They had chocolate and cigarettes, and they threw it out of the tank, and they threw it down for us. It wasn't enough for all of us, and we -- my sister looked at me and said, \"Did you hear that? We're free.\" I said, \"Yes, but where are we going to be?\" We were free, we were happy, but no place to go. But, we had more than other people because we had each other. So while we were sitting around in the woods, we all got together and, \u201cWe got to do something. Where are we going? We're not going to go back to Germany.\u201d So one of the girls, Slovak girls, said, \"I lost two sisters in Auschwitz. I'm not going home alone. You two girls are going with me.\" So we traveled from Malchow to Czechoslovakia, my sister and I. And we came there, and to our surprise her parents were still there. Her little brother was there, and they greeted us with open arms. For the first time we seen parents again and people who were good to us. Gave us clothes, gave us food, and it was like such a relief. It was unbelievable. We stayed there four weeks, and they fed us. And, of course, we had only one wish, to come to the United States. So no matter they did, my sister and I looked at each other and I, I remember my father, my mother had told me that I should remember an address in New York City. It was \u201c648 184th Street in New York City;\u201d that was my aunt's address. And I said to my sister, \"You know, I know Tante Anna's address.\" And she said, \"No, you don't.\" I said, \"Yes, I do.\" I said, \"If I get only to that address, then we'll be fine.\" Well, there no one -- you know, you couldn't do anything. I mean, we went in the nighttime, early in the morning we went over the border from Czechoslovakia to Austria. And the border was like a train -- what do you call the train, what the train goes on?"

            "answer": "A train track. And on one side the Russians stood, and they wanted to shoot when they seen two little girls, two young girls coming there. So I said to them -- I knew a little bit Russian, I said I was a Gypsy and I looked like one. My hair had grown by then, and it was long and a comb I didn't have. And I said I was Gypsy -- and it was pitch black because I was a blonde before. \"My father lives in Austria, and we want to go to Austria.\" Would they let us through? They said no, they had to shoot us. And we said, \"No, no, no. We can't be shot. We have to get through here and just close your eyes. Turn around. Let us go.\" So they said, \"Okay, close your eyes.\" And we closed our eyes. \"Go right through, but when you get over the border there will be the Americans. They're going to be shooting at you.\" Well, there was no American shooting at us. The Americans were fast asleep, it was five o'clock in the morming. And we got into Austria. Once we were in Austria, we went to the train station. We figured that was the right thing to do. And there we seen other survivors. Why would we know that they're survivors? They looked like us. They had not much clothes, and they said to us, \"You, you must be\" -- at that time they were called \u201cKZ ler,\u201d \u201cconcentration camp,\" you know. And we said, \"Yes, we are.\" And they said, \"We'll take you to a DP camp.\" So they took us to a DP camp, and we lived in Austria until we were ready to come to America, in Gmunden, in Kammer-Schorfling. And through the help of the American soldiers which we met in Austria, they were stationed in Austria, we wrote to my aunt. And my aunt got the letter, and she was overwhelmed that we were alive, but, of course, everyone else had died. My grandparents and whatever. And she sent us food and she sent us clothing, and we were saved. We came to America in 1946 in July. It was a year and three months after the liberation, which was good. That\u2019s where -- and after I was here for a little while, my aunt thought it would be wise to put it in the newspaper. Tell everybody that we are alive, but there was like the German Jewish newspaper called the Aufbau\u2019. She, she put it in there, and my husband read it and he came to visit me.

So the \"4 Konzentrationslager [concentration camp] (German) \u00bb\u00b0 Reconstruction (German); popular periodical of the German-Jewish community in America. Gypsy was right, I married the guy I knew from way back when, and I had a son and a daughter. And now I have five grandchildren, and I have a lovely daughter-in-law and a lovely son-in-law. And I have my own family, thank God. That's something I never would have dreamt of, something I thought it would never, so I marched into Auschwitz and I was one of the lucky ones who marched out. Not many did. ... Now, my friend, Martha, survived, and she lives here partly. And the other one lives in Queens, and Zippy lives in Manhattan. And I have the two other friends in Israel, and that's about it."

I have all the bread you want.\" And she looked at me, and she said, \"Am I supposed to know you?\" And I said, \"Yes, you know me quite well. I'm Carola.\" And she says, \"Really?

We got a uniform like the American soldiers and on it here, it had the sign DP, displaced persons. So we, we -- the Germans thought we were Americans, I guess, except we didn't speak the language. We were well taken care of there. They gave us food and everything. And, of course, we made connections. We met one soldier who came from Chicago who was originally from Germany, and he had been in the army. A very -- one very interesting story, I forgot to tell you that. And we were sitting in the -- what is 1t? They called the clubs PX, PX clubs, right? We were sitting there in the nightclub in Austria with this particular young man. I had met him in the synagogue on a Friday night, and he said that I was the first German Jew he had met. All were Polish Jews, and where did I come from. So I told him and we talked to each other, and he said he will get in touch with my relatives and tell them that I'm living, my sister and me. Which was very nice, and he offered to take us, my sister and me, to the club and there you could have something to eat and something to drink. And you could dance a little bit, and something we didn't have in years. And all of a sudden I'm sitting in the club, and I see this soldier sitting there. And I look at this young soldier I was with and I said, \"You know, I know this guy.\" So he looked \u2014 he says, \"Where would you know this guy from?\" I said, \"That soldier went to school with me in Germany in Bad Nauheim.\" He says, \"Are you kidding me?\" \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, \"I'll ask him.\" So he's sitting there and he calls, you know, he says to him, \"Hey, listen, listen.\" And I said to him, \"But his name isn't \u2018Listen.\u2019 His name is Max Bettman.\" So he said -- I didn't know the language that well. So he said, \"Is your name Max Bettman?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"Do you know this lady?\" And he looked at me and said, \"No.\" I looked at him and I says, \"I'm Carola,\" and he says, \"Oh, no.\" He couldn't believe it, that he went to school with me, and his father was the principal of the school. And he also helped to bring us to the United States, his father, yeah. And only about three years ago we had a reunion where I invited all the kids who survived from Bad Nauheim, and he was there, Max Bettman. He didn't remember that I said, \"This is Max Bettman,\" he didn't, you know. He had forgotten. But I, the funniest part was that when I said, \"Don't call him Listen. His name is Max Bettman.\""

So I stayed there and took the temperatures of people and they gave me uniform, whatever. And, when I was liberated, I worked in an Army, American Army hospital for a little while.

It took us a while to adjust. I remember I was quite sick. Something went wrong with my intestines, I had very often terrible cramps. Because you had to really get used to food again; we had no food whatsoever. And if you ate anything fatty, the gallbladder acted up, so it was quite hectic for me to get used to. But the minute I sat my foot on an American boat to come to America, I never had another attack of pain. It may be psychological. The minute I entered -- on the boat, everybody was sick. Everybody was throwing up, that was a natural thing. But I never had another gallbladder attack. And I was examined in Austria. For the gallbladder had bent, or was out of shape, or something like that. So somehow I felt I was safe, on safe ground, in coming to America."

            "answer": "'46. Right. He came to visit. And well, he had been a friend of mine in at school in Bad Nauheim, but we didn't want to get married. I mean we were just good friends, and thing were very lonely for me when I came to America, you know. He had been in the Army and he spoke the language, and I sort of spoke it okay. And he was very good, and he -- I had told him my whole story. He always wanted to know more and more. He was very warm because in the beginning it was very hard for me. First of all, I didn't know the language too well. Second of all, when you rode in the subway and it was in the summertime and you were exposed, a number of people would walk away from you and say, \"What in the world 1s that? She has a number on her arm.\" There weren't too many of us at that time in 1946, and I felt very isolated, very lonely. And if you wanted to tell actually what happened to you, people used to say, \"Don't tell me that. I won't sleep tonight. I don't want to hear your story.\" I mean I didn't tell people on subways, but my own relatives -- they were awfully nice to me, they were really good. But they didn't want to hear our stories because they were getting on in years, and they didn't really want to be bothered. My aunt, I told the story, and then, \u201cIt's enough. I won't sleep tonight.\u201d So, therefore, no one did anything. Of course, we were not American citizens. We couldn't afford a psychiatrist or anything like that. We were just -- we were just people who had to get into the mainstream of life, you know, and we tried very hard. We didn't -- German wasn't spoken in America because the war had ended. If you spoke German, they looked at you like you were a Nazi. So we had to speak the language which was good, I suppose. And we got together with our own people, people who were in camps. And very often I heard from people who had come here previously, I heard them say, \"Well, these people who were in camps, they behave awfully strange.\" And I'm a sensitive person, I didn't like to hear that. We did behave awfully strange, but nobody took in consideration what we had actually gone through. So it got to a point where we sort of separated ourselves from everyone, and we said -- we got together on social occasions, only the survivors, the ones who survived. But we went to work and we started a new life, and we got into the mainstream. And I went, -- I knew how to sew which I had learned in Frankfurt. I went into the factory and I made piecework, worked in a blouse factory. And it was in 1946, 7, I made $80 a week, which was a fortune. And everyone around me hated me because at that time we were piece -- they were pieceworkers, and if you worked too fast you ruined the prices for the other people. I didn't know that. I did it as fast as I could because I wanted to make money in the worst way. So that was pretty tough, but I made it. I mean I had an average of $60, which was pretty nice in 1946 and seven when really people didn't make too much money. And then I paid the money to my uncle and aunt who let me stay there. You know, and my aunt cooked for me, and I lived there. And it was very cozy and very nice, and then my husband would come and take me out for dinner. My husband, he wasn't -- he was just a boyfriend -- would take me to the movies and things like that. And from then on, life got a lot easier for me."

Don't talk about it and do it. But when I think back now -- I'm an old lady, and I think back at the time, the hard times we had, I sometimes don't understand how I survived it and how I did it. And how I -- later on we had the bakery and I worked there, and it was all completely strange to me, bakery and whatever, but I did it. And whatever I did, thank God, I was pretty good at it, so they tell me. So, at least I know some through college, and my daughter or whatever, it was hard work to do all that. And we wanted -- they denied us a free education in Germany. Maybe I could have gone to nursing school, but I didn't have the means and have the money, and so I didn't. But I wanted my children to have the education that everyone deserved, so we worked, both my husband and I, we worked very hard to get our son through law school and the whole thing, you know. So you just, I would say, get up and do it. Don't think back what has happened, don't have pity. Don't look, look in the past, look 1n future."

And, you know, come to think of it, he said the same thing. He said, \"She didn't look back and she didn't live in the past. She lived in the present, and she lives in the future.\" And, we never discussed the Holocaust in our house. We didn't cry -- if I cried, I cried on my own. I never showed my kids that I was a poor Holocaust survivor. They never knew about that, I used to pick him up when he was a baby and I used to hold him. And I used to say, \"They're never going to take you away from me,\" you know. And I really thought I had created something here. You know I wanted to really hold onto him, and that he didn't know. I only knew that he was so dear to me. Once I had this little boy in my arms, I thought the world belonged to me. And then another little girl, it was just wonderful. But I went on with life and didn't look back and I think I accomplished, after all this horror, I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish. Not quite, but I'm not finished yet. And like I listen and read the stories and I hear these kids saying -- of course, they're right -- they keep saying, \"We have to tell the story because soon the survivors will be dead.\" So the kids who go through the March of the Living say that, \u201cWe have to tell the story; therefore, we're going through the March of the Living -- the Holocaust survivors will be dead.\u201d I don't want to hear it. I want to live for a while yet and tell my story. And I think maybe I will. With God's help, I will. Well, the \u2018\u201c\u201cShema\u2019\u201d I've been saying in Auschwitz, at the roll call, appell, I still say. If things get really tough and you know they have been. I've complained already in the meantime and I've had all kinds of diseases, I'll say my \u201cShema,\u201d I go on. So, basically, I wouldn't call myself a very orthodox person, but I would call myself an observer. And I think everybody should, in their own religion, should be observant.
