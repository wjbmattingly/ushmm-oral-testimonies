And they went to school, and I went to his office, my father\u2019s office, and I knocked quick at the door of his office, and I told him about the situation. And soon he \u2014 before you knew it, he had them arrested. And sure enough, they were spying for the Nazis, the Germany.

And so we went up to the hill, and there I saw Murray Pruzan, that he had been killed. He tried to save the \u2014 well, he did save the \u2014 our captain \u2014 commander\u2019s life. He had severe wounds, and he was unconscious. But Murray was \u2014 was cut in half by machine guns. I lost my friend.
