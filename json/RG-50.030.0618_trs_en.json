And \u0152 and so, at that time as I \u0152 as I started to grow up, he \u0152 it was time when the Olym pics was supposed to start. Mexico was the named nation to \u0152 for the Olympics, world Olympics. And so my father decided to build a big Olympic swimming pool, which was a hundred meters long, by 50 meters wide, with all the decorations, as a \u0152 a \u0152 an Olympic swimming pool would look like, and with a \u0152 a transmitter along the side of that swimming pool so that people could listen to the music, and \u0152 and promenade. So, while I was going to school, we all got excited about the Olympics, but then there was two other fellows and myself, we al \u0152 they all \u0152 always called us the \u0152 the three musketeers. And I liked to make \u0152 do exercise, and so I \u0152 I trained re \u0152 by looking at the books my father had of Charles Atlas , well-known then. And every morning we used to \u0152 well, these fellows would come over and pick me up, and we\u2122d go swimming at the swimming pool, five in the morning. And then about seven, we\u2122d head back to s \u0152 to school. This time it was about \u0152 the war had started, the 40s, 1940.

He says that there\u2122s a Morse code going on, and \u0152 and \u0152 and there \u0152 there are submarines in Baja , California connected with \u0152 with these people. I says, but how? How do you know? Yeah, I hear, dara de dara dara de dara dara dara \u0152 so they said that we better get to your father. So we decided \u0152 we dashed out that swimming pool, we headed back to school. And they went to school, and I went to his office, my father\u2122s office, and I knocked quick at the door of his office, and I told him about the situation. And soon he \u0152 before you knew it, he had them arrested. And sure enough, they were spying for the Nazis, the Germany . Well, I didn\u2122t realize then that we had a \u0152 a German colony in \u0152 in Mexico . And here I was associated well with the groups of fellas, Boy Scouts. We had formed a Boy Scout group, and our scoutmaster, Boy Scout master was the Schraeder (ph), a Schraeder (ph) family that owned a hardwood store there in Durango. And so, by that time I was 17 and a half years old, and an amer \u0152 the consul general of the United States was after me because of my age, and get ready Interview with Anthony Acevedo October 13, 2010 11 to go back in United States and serve your country.

And at that time I didn\u2122t know the traveling situation, because I had never traveled. And \u0152 and I \u0152 I had my little satchel with me, and little suitcase. And I heard somebody say, psst, psst, psst, just a \u0152 like a whistling at me through the window of the other coach train. And I went up, and he says, give it to me, he say, I have a seat here for you. So we met fre \u0152 made friends, and we became friends until a year later. But I\u2122ll tell the story about that. I \u0152 I said goodbye to him, because he was supposed to meet his sister there, in Juarez . I crossed the border, and I headed to Pasadena , back to my cousin\u2122s. And that\u2122s where I headed for induction, the following day. And then the \u0152 the head of the induction center said that I needed another semester of school. And I said, why? He says, well, we don\u2122t evaluate the sc \u0152 the \u0152 what you went through in your school, is not enough. I says, I went to school seven in the morning Interview with Anthony Acevedo October 13, 2010 12 til six in the evening. Isn\u2122t that enough? And, I says, they teach us very much over there. More than they teach you here. I couldn\u2122t say any more, he says, but you need \u0152 you need a one semester. So I went to Pasadena City College , I took a course, and I passed by three months in that vacation. And I wa \u0152 I got my diploma, and \u0152 and I\u2122m in the army. So before I knew it, I was in Oregon , in Camp Adair, Oregon. We call it Swamp Adair , because it was full of swamps. And then I was transferred, and I had special letters that my father had given me, as a duc \u0152 introduction, showing that my efforts was to \u0152 wanted to be a doctor.

He had severe wounds, and he was unconscious. But Murray was \u0152 was cut in half by machine guns. I lost my friend.

There must not be no feeling. Why they have that audacity, that yet it doesn\u2122t penetrate into their minds, the feelings of what other people have, a life.
