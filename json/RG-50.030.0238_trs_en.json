            "answer": "Well, I came from Budapest, Hungary; my father had eight \u2014 seven brothers. There were eight brothers altogether. And my mother had 12 sisters and brothers. But I didn't know them. I knew only one of them because by the time I was born after World War II \u2014 World War I, I'm sorry, there were only one of my mother's sister alive. And my father, he had brothers, and some of them died in World War I. And as I mentioned to you, big family, they were. Now, what else would you like to know? What my father did? My father was photographer, and he was the official photographer for the Hapsburg family, was the king that time. And after that he was the official photographer of Admiral Horthy! whom he knew from World War I, from Vienna. They were together in the so-called \u201cwar miniszt\u00e9rium.\u201d\u201d And he had a very well known photography studio in Budapest, at that time, for the upper class, princes and barons and so forth. And besides it also, he was a high society photographer, let's put it, in short."

            "answer": "Yes. I grew up in photography, and I had a brother of mine who was also a photographer, and \u2014 but he was 11 years older than I am. And I learned photography from my father, which his famous saying was, \"I'm not teaching you. You just watch me.\" I was just watching him. And when he died, he was right, because I knew most of it from him. Naturally, I had studying, but the actual photography I learned from him; just watching. Besides, speaking about photography, he was mostly doing portraits, studio portraits, and he wanted to \u2014 me to go out and do outside work, which I loved to do. As a matter of fact, I didn't want to be a photographer until I was 15, and that's when I \u2014 excuse me \u2014 that's when I had the feeling that I want to be a photographer. And he also had a photography shop; small, elegant photography shop with cameras. And I decided I want to be a photographer. And I took the first camera, which was a Leica from the shelf. And he wasn't there, but he just came in and he said that, \"What are you doing?\" I said, \"I want to be a photographer. I took this camera I'm starting with.\" He took the camera out of my ' Mikl\u00e9s Horthy * Ministry (Hungarian) hand; he put it back on the shelf. He took the oldest camera that exists which \u2014 not with films, with plates \u2014 and he said, \"That's where you start, with the oldest camera.\" He said, \"If you want to know photography, you have to start from scratch.\""

            "answer": "Nothing happened. It was going on until quite \u2014 the end of the war. I mean, end of Horthy. I have a funny story to tell you if \u2014 I don't know if it belongs here or not, but as I said, every time there was a new cabinet member, he was called up until maybe I was 16 or 17, he started to send me up to the palace to do the picture. So one morning, he got the call, and that was during the war already, maybe in the mid\u2014 around 1943, I would say, which was close to the end of the war \u2014 but we didn't know that then \u2014 that the new Secretary of War will be coming. They changed, because Hungary was starting to get slowly out of the war. So anyway, he got the phone call to send \u2014 to go up. So he said, \"In the afternoon you have to go up to the palace to do the new Secretary of War.\" I said, \"I cannot do it.\" \"Why not?\" I said, \"Because\" \u2014 it's hard to explain it, at that time in Hungary from the early '20s, there was a so-called paramilitary. It was a paramilitary organization which you had to go. It was a must. And they were practicing every week outside the outskirts of Hungary, no Budapest. So I said to him, \"Because I have this obligation.\" He said, \"The hell. You don't go there.\" I said, \"I have to, because \u2014 Okay. Then ask the head of there what you have to do and he will release you.\" All right. So I went out there, and there's a train, tram, and at the beginning you had to \u2014 is it interesting at all, what I'm saying? At the beginning you had to go to him and ask for permission to leave. He said, \"What is the reason?\" I said, \"Because I have to take the picture of the new Secretary of War.\" He looked at me and said, \"You.\" I said, \"Me.\" He said, \"Well, I let you do it, because that's the biggest lie I have ever heard. I'll let you do it. But you bring me a paper where you have been Tuesday afternoon between 3:00 and 5:00,\" because that's \u2014 So I went. I did the pictures. And after the picture taking, I knew he was the head of the cabinet, miniszt\u00e9rium for PR and so forth, and I went to him in the building, and I said, \"I need the paper that I \u2014 he was laughing, and he gave me the official paper of the Hungarian cabinet stating that Thomas Veres was, between 3:00 and 5:00, taking picture of the new Secretary of War. Next time I showed it to him, and he flipped. That's the end of that story."

            "question": "That's a good question.",
            "answer": "I know. That's why I'm asking. Which one do you want? Because that was two different period. Because Hungary not necessarily was on the German side, and the historical background comes out now in today's days because of World War I mistake when the biggest part of Hungary was taken away. And Hitler was the only one who was supporting, because he himself was Germany's leader, to get back what was taken away. Now, I don't in history \u2014 I have to give you the historical background, which I think it's important because that made Hungary on the side of the Axis. And that made Horthy on the side of the Axis, because Hungary's part was taken most. Now, today, and in recent history, when Yugoslavia's breaking apart, one and a half million Hungarians were living there, then the Rumania, the Transylvania was taken away when two million Hungarians lived there, and just two days ago when Czechoslovakia, Slovakia, the upper part of Slovakia was \u2014 the lower part of Slovakia was mostly Hungarian, a million and a half. And that was the reason. And they were not Hungarian. It was a first only rightist government, and then it became more sliding to the right, more to the right, and at the end it became a Nazi government. But it was not a Nazi government until October \u2014 even then it wasn't called, because the Germans occupied Hungary in March 19th, 1944. And from March 19, '44, Horthy lost his power. He was just a figurehead. And in October 15th, when the government was taken over, those are the Hungarian Nazis. Then it became actual Nazi government. Does it answer your question?"

And, let me put it this way. My brother, who was 11 years old \u2014 11 years older than I am, he married an American which was accidental. It had nothing to do with Jewish or not Jewish. And he came to the States in 1939. And two days later or three days later, actually, he was called up for labor camp, to serve in labor camp. But he wasn't there. I was there. Except the bad rumors.

            "question": "All right. So let's just start again with how you came to make contact with Wallenberg.",
            "answer": "Yes. My father took his family pictures. He was a young man then, Per Anger, and his wife and little baby and it's about. I would say, two years before, this happened. And he also bought a Leica camera at that time, and I was teaching his wife how to use the camera because of the new baby and so forth. And then, I have seen them weekly as \u2014 not friends, but in a friendly > Raoul Wallenberg atmosphere. I \u2014 every week I \u2014 we used to live in the \u2014 it's a well-known building in Budapest, the Gerbeaud palace, or the Gerbeaud building, which was the most famous confectionery 1n all of Budapest. And in the war, naturally, there was not too many chocolate, and I got a box of chocolate every week, which I gave to his wife, wife, because she loved it. And when I actually \u2014 and it was an escape from the labor camp, though I took it easy and I call it I just stepped aside. I, you know \u2014 all I knew, my father also had the Swedish passport because he had Swedish friends. And very little, because I wasn't too much in contact by then with them, but I was able to go home. And he told me about it. He told me, \"You have also Swedish passport.\" And that gave me the idea that I go, when I escape the labor camp, to \u2014 right away, next morning, to go to the Swedish legation and look for Per Anger. Now, the way it actually happened was there were hundreds of people, that was on the Buda side, hundreds of people waiting in front of the legation asking for the Swedish passport. But the policeman didn't let them in. So somehow I worked my way to the policeman, and I asked him, \"Would you please send a message to Per Anger that Thomas Veres is here and would like to speak to him.\" In about a half an hour, somebody came out, two other policemen, and said \u2014 made on the loud speaker announcement that everybody should immediately leave the territory of the Swedish legation, immediately, except Thomas Veres. And a cold sweat was coming down. And they let me in. And I met Per Anger, and he said, \"What can I do for you?\" I said, \"Look, I just left the labor camp, and I'm asking you what you could help.\" \"Oh, I introduce you to Raoul.\" And a young man came in. \"Raoul,\" he said, \"this is Thomas Veres, friend of mine, photographer.\" \"Oh, yeah. You will be my photographer.\" And in ten minutes the official paper was made out that Thomas Veres is the official photographer of the Swedish legation of Hungary. And Wallenberg signed it, and he gave it to me. I never used that paper because it wouldn't mean anything at all. But he said, \"From now on, you will be my photographer, and you will do documentary what we are doing here for the outside world to show what's happening. You will report directly to me\" \u2014 not to the usual people who were working on the passports. And that's how I became his photographer."

I was quite skeptical to \u2014 \u201chow am I going to take pictures?\u201d And slowly, I learned my lesson. First I did, as I told you before, many of the actual passport pictures of people who needed it for him, not for direct, not for the people. What we did when he did save people and they didn't have the Swedish papers, we reversed the action. I did the pictures. In the meantime, the officers did the passport, and the two were together. It was a post-issued passport, which didn't say it, but that's how it happened. When the actual \u2014 Can we stop here? I'd like to drink. [Technical conversation]"

            "answer": "Yes. Remember, I told you that he said for documentary to show to the outside world what's happening, in his words, as a documentary. Now, I started saying if I remember that one morning, which is November \u2014 end of November, I think it was either 27\", 28th or 28\", 29, in the morning, because at that time my parents were still in the Gerbeaud house in our old home. And I went home to sleep. During the day I was with the Swedish legation, what I told you doing passport pictures until then. And then one morning, early morning \u2014 he used to start early morning, so did I. Even up to today. I was there before seven o'clock or 6:30. And a small, handwritten note wait for me. And his secretary said, \"Tom, Wallenberg sent this note to you.\" And the note said that \"Wait\" \u2014 \"Come out to the \u2014 meet\u201d \u2014 no, I'm sorry, \"Meet me at the Jozsefvarosi Palyaudvar,\" which is the train station at the outskirts of Budapest, and it's a freight station, not for the public. I have never been there. And I went out by train, and I get there and the whole train station was surrounded by Hungarian gendarmes, and there I was with a camera in my pocket with Wallenberg's note. He was quite, I call it naive, of those dangers. Even if he realize it, he tried to somehow minimize it. So I went to the first gendarme and I started to say half German, half English, half Hungarian, trying to imitate I'm from the Swedish legation and I want to go in. And the guy looked at me like, \"Who wants to go in this place?\" So I talk my \u2014 I had to talk my way in there. I didn't show them any paper. That would be the worst. My mouth took me in there. And the train station had about 10,000, 15,000 men, Jews, ready for deportation. They were the ones who were surrounded from Budapest, the labor camps, who were still at that time, end of November, sent to Germany by train. Later on, it was on foot. This time it was by train, for deportation. And Wallenberg was there and set up a little table. And I went to him and he whispered in my ear, \"Tom, take as many pictures as you can.\" I didn't want to ask him \"Will you pose for me\" or, you know, \"How?\" So I had my coat on me and I had a shawl, and I always have a pocketknife with me, and I made a slit in the shawl and prearranged the camera setting on my Leica, and I just \u2014 through the shawl I did bring just the lens out and started, through the shawl, shooting. Sometimes I was sitting in his car and shooting from the car, and sometimes I just went around looking left or right like nothing happened and take the pictures. Up till \u2014 first of all, somebody was yelling to me, \"Tommy, Tommy.\" It was not my best, but one of my best friends with whom I was in school from first grade until the end of my schooling. We were sitting next to each other. So I didn't want to be recognized, and I whispered to him, you know, \"Do something.\" And I kicked him in the butt, and I said, \"Dirty Jew. Go over there,\" in Hungarian; that the line was standing for information to give that you have Schutzpass* or not, because that's what Wallenberg in a big book had to verify it, \u201cyes, no, yes, no.\u201d * Protective pass (German) And he was trying, naturally, also for the ones who didn't have it, to say \u201cyes,\u201d and go to the left, go to the right, go to left, go to right.

            "answer": "That's self explanatory. What I wanted to follow-up, the next thing I heard, again, \"Tommy, Tommy.\" And this was a first cousin of mine. And the same thing happened. I went to him. The idiot start, \"Tommy, Tommy.\" I said \u2014 I kicked him in the butt, too. \"Dirty Jew. Go over there.\" And the third one, which I remember, I can recall, I saw in the line. He was a very well known Hungarian actor, theatrical actor. And usually he played farmers. He was a Jew, but he played farmer, Hungarian farmer. He was very good. He was standing in the line. And he didn't have \u2014 I went to him, and I whispered to him. He didn't have the passport. So I went to Wallenberg, and I whispered to him, \"That's a famous Hungarian actor, well-known Hungarian actor.\u201d He let him go, you know. He looked at the book; \u201cyes.\u201d The interesting part of that one was that maybe two or three years later the same actor who was again in the theater came to my photo shop. And naturally he never saw me before. And I said to him, \"Have you been 1n the Jozsefvarosi Palyaudvar?\" And he said, \"Yeah.\" And I said to him, \"Do you know who was the one?\" He didn't \u2014 He looked like he didn't believe me, that I was actually the one who saved his life. But he was nice, but then, nothing special. You asked me about if there was any danger. So that was the second \u2014 I was there two days, and then this kind of deportation start. From then on they started taking people on foot. And on the second day, there was a friend of mine, too, in the car. And while the procedure was going on, and taking picture, \"Let's see what's happening behind the train.\" And we slid behind the trains, and they were already ready and closed. All you saw in those little cattle wagons, you had clear windows with wrought iron. And hands were sticking out and yelling and crying, \"Help, help.\" You heard people, \"Help me out. I give you 100,000 pengo,\" and this and that, and \"I own a coffee house here.\" So it was a terrible thing, because you only heard it. So with my friend, we slip closer to the wagon and start \u2014 it opened amazingly easy. It opened up. Started to open one door, and people slowly \u2014 the wood panel which they walked up was still there, and slowly they started to come out. And we were trying to tell them to go to the other side; that's where the procedure is going on. And didn't notice in the big excitement that slowly whispering, \"Hungarian police officer.\" I'm saying \"Hungarian police officer,\" because in the whole thing there was only one German involved, and his name was Dannecker?. He was the right-hand of Eichmann\u00ae who wasn't there that time. The rest of it was Hungarian gendarmes. The German, Dannecker, he just stood there silently like he's not doing the whole thing. And the couple of Hungarian higher-up, and he was a captain, and he noticed me and started yelling in Hungarian, \"Stop immediately.\" And then pulled his revolver, aiming. Meantime, Wallenberg came over too, somehow, luckily. With the car, they pulled over and pulled up and said, \"Jump. Tom, jump!\" I would have gotten the Olympic record for this, because I jumped so fast that I jumped in the car. And we closed the door and pulled out. > Theodor Dannecker \u00a9 Adolf Eichmann They were yelling after us, and that was the last time we went there. Wallenberg said jokingly, \"We cannot come back here.\" So that was the \u2014 that showed a little bit of danger. Next, your question."

When, for instance, the International Ghetto was built, I'm sure you heard about it, it was called the International Ghetto, where not only the Swedish but different other legation who had imitated the Swedish success, Swiss, Vatican and so forth. And was \u2014 a certain part in Budapest was called the International Ghetto which was under protection of different legations. And when there was need for it, I was there for a day to try to get people in, because all the people who lived there, had to go out if they were Christians, and the Jews were coming 1n under Swedish protection or any other protection. There were \u2014 because the plan of the Nazi government was \u2014 Hungarian Nazi government was, up till then, from March 19.... Look, 1f I'm telling something you heard before, then stop me."

            "answer": "Up till March 19, start \u2014 they did not put the Jews in ghettos. They named certain houses yellow-star houses which was mostly occupied by Jews. But that was all over Budapest. Certain house was, the next house wasn't, and they were called yellow-star houses. Now, the plan of the Hungarian Nazi government was, at the end, to empty all those houses and put them in the actual ghetto, which there was a ghetto which was not done and not established, actually, by the Nazis. It was its own ghetto like in every European city. Mostly for the very orthodox Jews. And they lived there for years and years. But as I said, they were concentrated \u2014 it was concentration by little. First in houses, and then to put them in the ghetto and then to kill the ghetto. That was the plan. Now, the Swedish or International Ghetto was these people with passports. And not in those, but in one of the houses which was a yellow-star house, I was with Wallenberg, and the phone said that one of the yellow-star houses had been taken away by the Arrow Cross, which 1s the Hungarian Nazis. So Wallenberg said to me, \"Let's go.\" And I went too, not as photographer, but as interpreter. With him I spoke either German or English. I knew a little English. And we arrived to the house, and the house was empty. And I don't know what floor. There was one Arrow Cross officer who was not only Arrow Cross, but he was \u2014 it is hard to translate it from Hungarian. It was a \u2014 a certain organization of the Arrow Cross, to put it this way, who was designated strictly for killing. So this captain was there from the Arrow Cross, and Wallenberg told me \u2014 I was the interpreter \u2014 \"Ask him where are the Jews,\" because there was nobody in the house. He said, \"In the Danube.\" \"Ask him why.\" He said it as natural as he can, \"Because they were dirty Jews.\" He also said, \"They were swimming in the Danube,\" yeah. So he did not only go out \u2014 when he got \u2014 there was help here needed, he went out. Now, he said to me that, \"There is nothing we can do here,\" and we left. Next question."

Now, the people involved, except that organization which I told you that \u2014 the Schutzlingsprotokoll, they \u2014 all of them were older than I was; yes, quite older. And the technicality, because it was a big organization and a fantastic organization; very well organized, issuing the passports. Now, his idea was to make them, because the Germans \u2014 and that was not with the Hungarians; mostly with the Germans \u2014 they like legality, and he wanted to make it real legal. And all his speaking with the Hungarian Nazi government or with the Germans, he was proving \u2014 in other words, it wasn't just a piece of paper. It was all the documents behind it. Like if it called \u2014 it was needed \u2014 excuse me \u2014 Swedish connection. The Swedish, the letters, proving the Swedish connection have been all documented with each passport. Against that was the Swiss legations organization who had issued to anybody, without any paperwork background, which that's why it took away a lot from the Swedish organization in legality. And \u2014 and also, it was not recognized. Or if 1t was, it was not recognized like the Swedish. And the reason for that was, that he was a good man, but he did not take as part in it. His name was Lutz,\u00ae who was the Swiss legation's \u2014 head of the Swiss legation. And he did not take part just \u2014 as Wallenberg did, bodily and in mind. So the Swiss legation was called the Baross utca, and anybody \u2014 and there would be crowds there. When there was \u2014 sooner or later, they just started up without any paperwork. Now, to some people this was right; to some people this was wrong. I don't know if I under\u2014 I make myself understand why, but behind the Swiss legations, which was not in the Swiss legation building \u2014 it was in the Baross utca, it was called \u2014 was mostly the Zionist movement.

            "answer": "Ihave been sleeping in my home all \u2014 all right. I have to think back. First of all, it happened just the day when, after \u2014 hold on a second \u2014 after the Nazis took over and I was still in that labor camp. And I wanted to know, because I had the right from my captain, as I told you, to go home and sleep. And that weekend, when the Nazis took over, I was home. And then I had to go back to the camp, and I was there for two days, or a day. But I was quite concerned what's happening to my parents because the Nazi government took away the exemptions which Horthy gave. They nullified it. So I\u2014 another officer with whom I was well, friendship, I told him and he said, \"T'll come with you. I do have, anyway, some pictures to develop and that will be a good excuse.\" So we went to the \u2014 my parents' home, and I started to develop. He came with me in the darkroom, looking at this and that. And suddenly, the bell started non-stop ringing, the doorbell. Now, that was a big place, you must understand. It wasn't only the studio. It was the darkroom. It was the living quarters are all in a big place, like top penthouse or something. And I was in the dark in the darkroom and I heard voices, \"We are looking for the Jew who came in.\" That was me. Now, nobody would call me a Jew because I didn't have my armband, so somebody in the house who knew me reported it. So in the dark I was still developing. I took off my ring, I took off my [gesturing]. I knew they came for me, particularly. And it wasn't a Jewish house. So when I finished up the development, I didn't want to ruin, but my heart was pounding. So I go out and there is my friend, the officer, Hungarian army officer he was, and three Hungarian Nazis from the Arrow Cross dressed in Arrow Cross uniform with machine guns, with hand grenade, with revolver; name it. They were armed to the [gesturing]. And they started to question me. So my friend the officer, army officer, pulled his revolver and said, \"He's with me and nobody is harming him. He's doing work for the Army.\" And then I recognize. One of them was working downstairs in that confectionery store. And he came to me quite \u2014 he recognized me. Said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know him. He's a good Hungarian boy.\" And he left because my friend pulled his revolver. They were playing with the hand grenades like this. After the war, a year later I was just shooting in my studio, and a detective came with somebody. He said that this guy was arrested; that he killed I don't know how many Jews, and \"He is calling that he saved your life, and he wants your help.\" I went down. It was the Hungarian Arrow Cross guy. And I said, \"How many people?\" He said, \"Hundreds of people. He was taking them down to the Danube.\" What would you do now? I'm asking you the question. What would you do in my place? Because he was calling me as a witness that I save his life. Answer me. What would you do? That's one occasion I'm asking you a question. And I saw \u2014 Whether I was right or wrong, I said, \"I never saw him before.\" I figured he may have saved me \u2014 he was not the guy. It was my friend, the captain, who saved my life because he pulled his \u2014 how do I know how many hundreds of other people he killed? Okay. That's \u2014 I wanted to tell this because ever since, if it comes up in me: Did I do right or wrong? I could have saved the life maybe, but my testimony, I cannot go against the other people who he killed \u2014 that's number one. Number two, he was not actually the one. He came to me, because many times I went through this, after I was already saved, after he pulled the gun, after he said then \"Get out of here,\" my friend. So the question was \u2014 Yeah, I slept home then. Now, after the train story, Wallenberg told me that, \"I need this very fast because I want to send it with the next pouch, diplomatic pouch, to Sweden.\" \"When do you need it?\" \"Tomorrow.\" So I went home, sleeping. During the nighttime I print it. And this is why I don't know how many \u2014 I know I printed 12 prints of each. And there were a lot of pictures. And I took the pictures and the negatives, and it was already getting dark, and I knew he was \u2014 Wallenberg was waiting for me at the legation. And I was, at that time, mostly dressed not exactly, but similar to the Nazi uniform. I had boots, I had black riding. So \u2014 I didn't wear the armband. So I had the pictures, and I went, naturally, on foot to the legation from my parents' house. It was getting dark, and on one part of the trip was a narrow street, and I have seen people asking for identification over there, and they were Arrow Cross people. So I went to the other side. I was zigzagging until I reached the big square, and by that time it was really dark. And that Arrow Cross guy was also asking for \u2014 but I was too late. He was that close, as you to me now. And with a lamp, he was putting the lamp \u2014 you know, small lamp with batteries. Flashlight. You see? Flashlight, and asking. And there was somebody just showing his identification. So I had to make up my mind. If I stop and go this way, he would shoot after me. So I kept going, and when I reached him, the pictures were in my left hand, I said the Hungarian Nazi salute \u2014 like \u201cHeil Hitler,\u201d \u201cEljen Szalasi.!\u201d And he greeted me back like this [gesturing], and I kept going. And when I told \u2014 I reached the legation and I told Wallenberg what happened. I was still out of breath. And he told me, \"Tom, this is getting really dangerous, so from now on you give me all the negatives undeveloped and we'll take care out there.\" So that was the last time I saw these pictures and the negatives, and all the other negatives that I did later. Now, I still didn't answer the question how long. So one day shortly after this, which had to be the beginning of December, the fighting was \u2014 and the air raids were so heavy that I \u2014 but the phones were up to the last moment on. So it was so heavy fighting that I called my parents. \"I can't get through.\" It was really very dangerous. \"I'm going to sleep here.\" And from then on I was sleeping at the Ulloi ut legation. And that's where, later on \u2014 I don't know if you know that story, which was January the 10th, two days after the mountains, when we were up in the mountains. One night, it was a snowy night, and one night the Arrow Cross came and the whole legation was taken to the Arrow Cross place, a department of one of the Arrow Cross. So I knew this is the end again. And I had some false identification with me. I told you, I didn't believe in them. That was for the Red Cross, and it had red canvas binding. Very nice papers they were, stating that I worked for the Red Cross. And on the way to the Arrow Cross house, I ate it. It tasted very badly, but I ate it little by little. And I didn't want them to find it on me. And there were too many people. \u201d Hail Hitler (German) ' Long live (Ferenc) Szdlasi (Hungarian) Everybody from the whole legation was taken out. So a lot of people. Don't ask me how many, because \u2014 well over a hundred. So when we got to one building where they wanted to put us in the cellar, I heard the Arrow Cross yelling at each other, \"Put them on top of each other. They're going to die anyway.\" And then they didn't put them because there wasn't place for us, so they took it to their house and started to \u2014 They liked my boots. Right away I found customer. They said, \"This is mine.\" And we were standing next to the wall, hands up, and there was an old little guy there who was always very \u2014 he was a very nice person, but he always asked questions. And as we were standing next to the wall ready to go to the Danube for, you know, he is asking me, \"Mr. Veres, do you know which way is the Danube?\" So I think I didn't lose my sense of humor. I told him, \"Once the shooting starts, you know we'll be there.\" And the next moment a truckload of Hungarian policemen came with Wallenberg heading. What happened that the Arrow Cross did not note is on the other floor there was a phone connection. The whole room was phones, the woman who was doing the phones, who was the daughter of the head of the department, phoned Wallenberg and reached him. And he collected a truckload of Hungarian policemen, and they came with their truck. And they came in and he said that, \"These are my people. You cannot touch them,\" and took everybody out."

This building was one block where my parents' home was, and he was hiding in the bank-vault. Only with a password you could go in. And that was the last time I met him, when I got the phone from the super from the house that the Arrow Cross took away the whole cellar, Christians and Jews, everybody, where they lived, because they discovered a big, huge food supply from the confectionery, and they wanted the food take away. Now, the owner of that whole building and the confectionery, which wasn't just a little confection \u2014 now it's called the same name \u2014 was Swiss, originally Swiss owned. And one of the families started to yell to the Arrow Cross, \"You can't take this away. This is Swiss owned.\" And the Arrow Cross, as much as they knew, \"Swiss? That has to be Jews.\" And they were not Jews. And they took everybody from the cellar, Jew and not Jew alike, and emptied out the whole building. It was full of chocolate and sugar and you name it, sardines, and they took it. And they took everybody to that department of the Arrow Cross. And the people who they let out who were friends from the building told me that they were \u2014 last time they saw them, they were also hands up next to the wall, and they took them down to the Danube the next night to kill them.

You have food, you can sleep here, and I'll be back when I arrange for you with the ready papers.\" Two days later his mother, who I know from schooling, comes to the legation that, \"Tommy, please help now. They took him away.\" \"What do you mean? I told him he was safe there.\" \"Yes, but he went down because his fianc\u00e9e was living two blocks from there and they caught him on the street.\" I said, \"I'm sorry, I \u2014 I- this way I cannot \u2014\" And he never returned.

Knowing Wallenberg's hiding place, I wanted to speak to him. But the fighting was so strong, I couldn't get through. I mean, really. You can imagine that I was trying. It was impossible. Took me two days to get through. And I know the password. And as I have mentioned it, the bank-vault was a block away from the Gerbeaud house. They had been taken away. So I went to the bank-vault, said the password, and then he was coming out. And I told him what happened. He said, \"Tom, you know it's too late now. I can't do anything.\" So a few other people came out. There were just a few people in the bank-vault. And we went to the big \u2014 it was like a \u2014 it's a bank, you know, with all the windows there. And we were standing there in a round circle with the people who came out who were with him. They were important people for the legation. And his chauffeur, Vili'*. And we were standing in a circle, and the fighting outside is going on, and he started saying that, \"I'm going to Debrecen to pick up the, the new Hungarian \u2014 with new Hungarian government to plan for the future.\" I don't know if you know it. There was a big plan of his. He wanted to \u2014 the plan was almost ready. After the war, relief, and help to people. And it wasn't only for Jews. It was for the whole country. It was called the \u201cNansen Plan.\u201d And as we were standing there \u2014 And he also asked me if I want to come with him, and I said, \"I can't, you know. I'm looking \u2014\" I didn't know what happened to my parents, because I told you it took me a half a year. And so I said, \"No, I can't. I'm looking for my parents, to help.\" And as we were standing in that circle, one of them was about that size [gesturing], he went flat on his stomach and down on the floor. As it turned out, from a stray bullet, he was shot in the heart, just as we were standing there. And that was the last time I have seen him, which was \u2014 it had to be either 14 or 15 of January. Now, about the statue, which you didn't ask me, and you said you don't know. Do you know about the statue? [Technical conversation] Many years after, they raised money to raise a statue for him. And I know the artist and the people who were involved, and they asked me to take the little \u2014 it's called maquette of the statue '4 Vilmos Langfelder and I was working. On the pedestal of the statue was his profile, and the last eight or ten pictures, I was working with the artist, was done after \u2014 in the photography, what I did on him. That remind me; I never saw those pictures again. So I worked for a while with the artist; you know, in telling, showing pictures, this and that. And that was \u2014 the statue itself was a big snake with a man killing the snake. And on the side on the pedestal was his name and saying thanks for him from the Hungarian people. And they called me that \u2014 I don't know what day. Maybe it was a Friday, that the statue is up; \"We just finished it,\" in that park I have told you, \"and take some pictures before the official unveiling on Sunday.\" And that never came because the statue disappeared 1n the thin air. Now you have to live those times; that was already the Russians, the Communists, the everybody. Why? Everybody knew that they didn't like him. So obviously it was stolen by the Russians. Now, you don't \u2014 that was a big statue from here to there [gesturing]. A year later, I go to one of the exhibitions, art exhibitions, in Budapest, and the statue is there without his profile and without the inscription, and the statue's name was \"Fight Against Fascism.\" Years later, I was already here, and I was reading \u2014 somebody sent me a Hungarian magazine, and I see the statue there. Said that \u2014 what was his name? The Indonesian head \u2014 Sukarno!\u00b0. Sukarno was in Budapest and fell in love with a picture which \u2014 which title is \"The Snake Killer,\" and he bought it for his garden many moons later. And obviously, supposedly, right now it's standing \u2014 they must have different versions. Cannot be the same. But the same statue is one of the \u2014 in front of the pharmaceutical company \u2014 you're shaking your \u2014 you heard it? No. Okay...pharmaceutical companies in Hungary; standing there. I don't know if it has a title or not, but I had the \u2014 I read it also, and I know it's true. So that's the story of one of his \u2014 And then they raised statues today, which has nothing to do with that one, and doesn't remember Wallenberg to me at all, so...."

And try to be a mensch, which he was. That's it, a mensch, which he was. Because you don't find this type every day, and you may not recognize it when there is no trouble. But you do know who it is by the action when it's there. And very few people stand up when it's needed. And you think they are good friends, and they don't stand up for you. And do not wait for the time when the trouble is coming. Try to prevent the trouble. Because no matter where it happens in the world, should it be Hungary, Germany, the United States, the gutter people are there, no matter what and where they were born. And the same bad idea could be anywhere. Should it be called \u201cCommunist,\u201d should it be called \u201cNazi,\u201d they come out from the gutter. They float out when the people are not there to prevent it. That's it. I hope it says it. Conclusion of Interview."
