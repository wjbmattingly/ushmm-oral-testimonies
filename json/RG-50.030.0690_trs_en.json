Then there was something which is referred to historically as the Ugannah (ph). And basically what that was, it was a tax system which taxed artisans and industrialists, and didn\u2122t do very much for landowners, or others. So my father was pressed financially, and he gave up \u0152 basically they sold Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 4 their factories in Poland , and the \u0152 they \u0152 my uncles remained, and they used to rent space in \u0152 in other factories, but my father, at first, moved to Finland . And that was a little bit too far from \u0152 from Poland . So he moved again to Zemu n in \u0152 well, today it is Serbia . And in Serbia he had a bad experience, he ran in with a cousin of the king, who liked his business, so they gave him 72 hours to leave the country. And he had a \u0152 a number of jobs, until finally he \u0152 he found a job with a v ery big Hungarian complex called Csepel , that was run by a \u0152 a Jewish entrepreneur, Manfred George \u0152 actually, George Manfred .

This man Klinker (ph) and \u0152 and Tiso(ph), this was their main \u0152 main center of operations. And so my mother was very unhappy there, so she said \u0152 she s \u0152 when she found out that she was pregnant, she decided that she \u0152 this was not the place to deliver a child.

So they used to say yes, we want the fabric from Loden , and the name stuck. But he used to be a specialist, and one of the biggest problems that he had was raw material. He had to find [indecipherable] and th-the \u0152 the \u0152 the two or three plants where he was working consumed a huge amount of this, and specially these are the years where armies in \u0152 in Europe had to be dressed, and this was the basic coating material practically for everybody; for the German army, for the Polish army, for the \u0152 you name it.

            "answer": "We ll, I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll tell you very truthfully, in Hungary there was so much latent anti-Semitism that with laws and without laws, it \u0152 it \u0152 it didn\u2122t change the situation very much. I was a little bit surprised at the question that I was asked, because curiously enough \u0152 and I spoke to my sister about this, it would seem that th-there was less talk of Hitler in Hungary , as there was more talk of Mussolini . So, some reason another, it was only in this corporate state was much more popular as a \u0152 as a piece of conversation, than Hitler. And anti-Semitism was latent. In \u0152 in \u0152 in the years before we left, where we didn\u2122t know where the outcome was, there was, you know, they were pe \u0152 recruiting Jewish young men, but some were sent to the army, some were sent to work camps.

There was a \u0152 a movie called rou \u0152 Rosenschein (ph), or something like that, which described one of these work camps in \u0152 in Hungary . But basically, no-nobody heard anything. At least w-we \u0152 we weren\u2122t aware of it. And going to a German school, we were not very aware of it. I mean, we were aware of it in that for Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 11 example, the \u0152 the Nazi clubs in which the youth \u0152 youth clubs, wouldn\u2122t have us.

But there were \u0152 there was considerable wool merch \u0152 wool \u0152 wool products, used wool products there. He had the brother, for example that he set up Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 13 in business in Paris , collecting for him. But no ma \u0152 he had \u0152 they had a relationship with the English company called John Crow ther and Sons , in Milnsbridge , which supplied a lot of raw material too, but th-they were always starved for raw material. So my father decided that the only sizable place that he could think of that would have raw material was the United States . And basically, he also had there two brothers and a sister, which he hadn\u2122t seen in some 30 years. So he, you know, he figured all of these things together, my mother wouldn\u2122t go, because we had to go to school, and so forth, and so on. Those trips were long. And he \u0152 he planned to be away for a long, long, long period of time, because he had to set up this business. So he actually came to New York , and he \u0152 he set up a business in Passaic , New Jersey , and he spent here well over six months, I think about nine months, or something like that. And then he decided to go back to \u0152 to Europe , and he got as far as Belgium , and took the train to \u0152 to Berlin , but he was turned back, because the Germans had invaded Belgium . So, he basically got onto the same boat that he took to New York , and came back to New York . He made a second attempt to return to southern Europe , but he only got as far as France, and he had to turn back. And then, of course, the United States was very, very \u0152 should we say, not receptive to \u0152 to \u0152 to refugees from an \u0152 anybody from Europe , as they had this quota system, which I understand 90 percent of the quota were never filled. Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 14 But anyways, he \u0152 he applied to stay in the United States , and he was hoping to bring us all there, at least to sit out the \u0152 the \u0152 the war, because he knew that if he couldn\u2122t get back two ways, I mean there was no reason for us to \u0152 to stay there. So he applied here f \u0152 as a matter of fact, there\u2122s a man by the name of Yrin, who does genealogy in this country, y-r-i-n. And one day, from the blue, he contact me, because this \u0152 a second name in my last name is Efron, and he was making a history of the Efrons .

They were moving money in and out of central Europe , and movi ng it to the United States , to Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 16 the Chase Manhattan bank, through Chase Manhattan in \u0152 in Paris . So he saw these two people in the park, and says, what are you doing here? They says, the same thing that you are. We are waiting for an American immigration visa. So my father said, you know what, we don\u2122t know how long we\u2122re going to have to wait, whether it\u2122s a week, a month, or \u0152 or \u0152 or years. And we\u2122re eating up our capital, you know, maybe we should start doing something. So they \u0152 they got together, and they started a business, which lasted 50 \u0152 54 years, 55 years, and by the time when my father got his American immigration visa, he wasn\u2122t interested. He had already made a \u0152 quite a commitment to \u0152 to Mexico . So we \u0152 we \u0152 we remained in Mexico ."

So she had taken on \u0152 she had gone to the Charles University in Prague, and she was studying medicine there, and we kept very close contact with h er. She \u0152 she used to come several times a month to Budapest to see m \u0152 to see \u0152 see our family. And basically, my father was supporting her. And she basically told us that, you know, they \u0152 she had been able to speak to her parents up to probably November of \u0152 of 1939. And the way she mi \u0152 she was able to speak to them is that basically she found a \u0152 a farmer \u0152 they found a farmer whose telephone was still working for Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 19 long distance calls. And every weekend they used to be in touch with her. And then suddenly, at the end of November, they \u0152 no more was heard from them. She tried \u0152 my cousin tried to go back into Poland , she was sent back from the border, she was not allowed in. And so, you know, we \u0152 we were extremely worried, because we \u0152 we heard nothing. That was the last thing we ever heard of my aunt and uncle. But my \u0152 my cousin was in constant touch with us. And as a matter of fact, even through the war, she was in touch with us. She \u0152 she was \u0152 again, she was being financed both economically, and fals e papers, by the management of the company with \u0152 which my father had a partnership in Zylina . So she basically \u0152 I \u0152 I don\u2122t know how this man did it, but he \u0152 he \u0152 through the red cro \u0152 we were getting Red Cross letters almost every two or \u0152 two or three months.

And the plant was managed by man called Mousekopf (ph). This man Mousekopf Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 20 was Jewish, and he \u0152 he managed to \u0152 to \u0152 since he \u0152 it was important for the German war effort \u0152 I mean, he was producing coating and fabrics for \u0152 for the German army. He was what they call a protected Jew. So basically he \u0152 he was able to move around and \u0152 and he was able to \u0152 to employ a lo \u0152 there was a very big ge \u0152 pop \u0152 Jewish population in Zylina . Zylina is very close to the Polish border, it\u2122s a Polish German border. So, he was able to \u0152 to \u0152 to supply jobs to a lot of the Jews in the \u0152 in the city, and many of these people were not supposed to be there. In other words, they \u0152 they had been refugees from Poland . So they \u0152 Mr. Mousekopf (ph) mana ged to get residence papers for them. And they didn\u2122t get residence papers, he did exactly what he did for my cousin, which is picked up papers of people that had died, or something like that. Which was very dangerous and not \u0152 not \u0152 it \u0152 it \u0152 you know, it\u2122s something that may have worked for a month or two, and then they had to fire them, a-and give them a new set of papers, and rehire them, because the Germans \u0152 not the Germans, but the \u0152 the USB , the Slovakian secret service suddenly got the list of people which had died, and this man \u0152 these peop \u0152 i-it was a \u0152 a very complicated undertaking, but he \u0152 he managed to \u0152 to save, I would say several hundred, if not \u0152 not \u0152 not a thousand, or more people in the Zylina area for \u0152 from the Germans, until 1944, when the Germans came in, got rid of the Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 21 Slovakian puppet government, and that was the \u0152 then there they took Jews, no matter whether protected or unprotected, or whatever they were."

            "answer": "Well, my cousin \u0152 my cousin is a \u0152 was a strange person. She was a strange person to the day that she died. She was a rebel, of the worst sort. I mean, as a child she had joined Hashomer Hatzair in Bialystok , which was not considered very \u0152 very Jewish, among the better \u0152 better members of the community, because they were the poorest of the poor, and the \u0152 the \u0152 they were definitely communistic. So, she had joined the Hashomer Hatzair , and of course, she in see \u0152 she was the only one that was living in the \u0152 i-in a decent housing area, all the meetings were held in her apartment, and my uncle used to absolutely blow his top. But it passed. And she was like that, too. She went to \u0152 to Czechoslovakia , and when the Germans invaded, she \u0152 she \u0152 she was part of the Czech underground. She basically spoke very good German, and she looked German. She \u0152 she was blonde, blue eyed. Blue eyed to the point of gray eye. So she made friends in the German occupation forces, and she got herself a job as the doctor. She \u0152 she was still a medical student, but she was in her process of getting her internship, whatever it is. So she was able to get Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 22 herself a job at the Gestapo jail in \u0152 in \u0152 in \u0152 in Prague, and she became the conduit between the people which were being held at the jail, and the underground and their families. And she did this til 1941, the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938. The university was closed, I think in November of 1938, because of strikes, student strikes. But she \u0152 she remained there, and she became an important cog in the communications system of the underground, with these people, until \u0152 until the end of 1941, when she suspected that she was compromised. In fact, we\u2122ve gone to the Holocaust Museum facilities, German files, and it\u2122s a fact. I mean, the Germans had her take \u0152 they had picked her up several times and let her go. But there was a \u0152 a record that she had been caught at \u0152 as a Jewess not wearing a Jewish yellow Star of David. There were several reasons that she had been picked up, because she had managed to \u0152 she \u0152 she was extremely adroit at getting herself out of trouble. As a matter of fact, she got, at one point, papers, which Mr. Mousekopf (ph) didn\u2122t know it, but they were of a communist girl. And guess what? The Germans had her on the list of \u0152 of people that they \u0152 they had to \u0152 so she came \u0152 she was taken to Gestapo headquarters, she was taken to the Gestapo head. And she walks into her office \u0152 into his office, and she sees a picture behind his desk of Bialystok . So he \u0152 she didn\u2122t let him say hello, it\u2122s just \u0152 she says, you know, ho-how did you ever have this picture of Bialystok ? So he says, well, you know, I was stationed there, I was Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 23 the head of the Gestapo in Bialystok . So how \u0152 how were you related to Bialystok ? She says, well, I \u0152 I belong to the German population of Bialystok , which \u0152 which were factory owners, and my father was a factory owner. And this is how I know Bialystok very well. My \u0152 my \u0152 my parents were still there for a while, I don\u2122t know where they are now, because the general \u0152 Generalgouvernement is not very informative as to where people are. So, you know, he made \u0152 she made a friendship, and when she walked in, she was about to be sent to wherever \u0152 God knows [indecipherable] was sent. She managed to walk out four hours later. And she managed also to \u0152 this false paper that she had, she managed to give it a certain aura of credibility. In other words, you know, he asked her, well, how come you are a communist? She says, you know, these were things of when you are a young ma \u0152 person, you \u0152 you think of other people, and this and that, and not of yourself. But this is something which is \u0152 which is gone past. So she managed to \u0152 to survive this way, on this set of papers, for close to three \u0152 three \u0152 well, more than that, she \u0152 she \u0152 she crossed the \u0152 the \u0152 she\u2122s crossed into Slovakia from \u0152 from the Czech Republic , from the other half, the night of Christmas of 1942. They figured that, and figured correctly that the German guards would be all drunk, having a Christmas party, and there was a huge snowstorm that night, but they managed to cross into Slovakia . Into Slovakia , they already had Mr. Mousekopf (ph) to help Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 24 her, and she lived in Nitra from late 1941 to early 1944, til practically August, September of 1944. She \u0152 she had joined also, the Slovakian underground. There was a Slovakian uprising, I think in August \u0152 July or August of 1944, which was the reason that the Germans came in. They felt that the Slovakians couldn\u2122t handle this, so they came in, and they cleaned out the place, to their liking. My cousin, curiously enough, could have survived, but again, she \u0152 principle was \u0152 used to get her, and this time it got her, too. Was basically she \u0152 she \u0152 she tells that she was picked up by the Germans, taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and sat down with a group of Jews. And this man that she knew in the Gestapo walked in, and says, what are you doing sitting there? You\u2122re not Jewish. Go home. So she got up and went home, and she describes it as having had a terrible night. I mean, considering that the rest of the Jewish population was being done to something, and deported, or whatever it is. So she basically walked in the next morning, into Gestapo headquarters and said, you know, you\u2122re looking for Jews, I\u2122m Jewish. The man was floored. He n ever in his wildest dream imagined her to be Jewish. She was about as far physically from being a Jew as \u0152 as \u0152 as you can imagine. Of course, didn\u2122t \u0152 this didn\u2122t help her. But she helped other people. She took Mr. Mousekopf \u2122s(ph) wife and daughter. She \u0152 she \u0152 she was able to \u0152 she went to Birkenau , and in the same transport, Mr. Mousekopf \u2122s(ph) wife and daughter were \u0152 were in that same transport. Mr. Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 25 Mousekopf (ph) had been actually \u0152 was able to hide with some \u0152 some Catholic priest. And she \u0152 she told the people at Birkenau that she was a surgeon, she was a \u0152 a doctor. So there was a shortage of doctors, not only for \u0152 for the inmates, but for actually the general population outside of the camps. So she was transported to Gross-Rosen , which was a satellite camp. And she said that she needed assistants. She was put in charge of a group of 200 agriculture workers, that were working in the fields around Gross -Rosen. So she said that, you know, she needed assistants. So she got the wife and daughter of \u0152 of this man Mousekopf (ph) to be her assistants, and all \u0152 all three survived the war. And she \u0152 she not only \u0152 she was actually taken by the camp commandant to his town in northern Germany , to see his mother, who was sick. And she says she could have stayed there. I mean, they liked her, they \u0152 they fed her, they \u0152 they clothed her, they \u0152 and \u0152 and they were very interested for her to stay around, because the mother seemed to be better with her being around. But she felt a responsibility, curiously enough, for those 200 people in Gross-Rosen , so she went back to the camps, and she stayed there til liberation, til \u0152 til May \u0152 May of 1945. Of course, we \u0152 we \u0152 we found out about her almost immediately. As liberation occurred, she was able to communicate with us, and we asked what happened to Mother and Father, and she says, we don\u2122t know. I lost total communications with her. I spoke to Vera (ph) the last time, which was Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 26 end of 19 \u0152 1939, early 1940. And she \u0152 you know, she told us the whole story, but we were \u0152 and my father actually came back, and believe it or not, paid \u0152 returned the money to the company that had been given out for my cousin, not for the other \u0152 well, the others worked at the company. But he felt that, you know, property pro \u0152 propriety was important."

            "answer": "\u0152 well, th-that was also a confusing issue. First, my father kept writing sa \u0152 horrible letters about Mexico , you know, poverty, dirt, this and that. My father \u0152 my mother said, you know, what are you trying to do to me? I mean, I\u2122m perfectly happy here. Budapest is a nice, clean city, with no problems of any \u0152 any sort. So, basically, I actually think that somebo dy \u0152 a \u0152 a general, or maybe even a field Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 28 marshal \u0152 I mean, the German army, who was the buyer for the cloth for the German army, came to talk to my mother, and he told her, look, this is no \u0152 no time for a Jew to be in \u0152 in \u0152 in Europe , and you know the \u0152 this will take a year, two years, and everything will be settled again, everything will come into its normal course, and you\u2122ll come back. But at this point, this is no point \u0152 no time to \u0152 for a Jew to be in \u0152 in \u0152 in Europe . Convinced her. The next prob lem was how to \u0152 how to travel. My father had arranged for her to \u0152 to take Verlichs (ph) out of Trieste \u0152 th-the ship out of Trieste to New York , there were two problems. First of all, she ccouldn\u2122t \u0152 she \u0152 she \u0152 it was very difficult to get a transit visa to the United States , which I think she finally got. But before she could leave, Mussolini got into the war, so that cut it off. Next thing is how to go when there \u0152 there were a lot of Jewish refugees who went to Russia . In other words, they \u0152 they took the TransSiberian to Vladivostok , from Vladivostok to \u0152 to San Francisco , or if not, from Vladivostok to Osaka , or Shanghai , and from there to \u0152 to San Francisco . So she figured that that made sense. I mean, Hungary has a border with \u0152 with Russia , and she hadn\u2122t seen her mother for, I don\u2122t know, 30 years, or 25 years, 30 years, so she would do both things. So she started to get a \u0152 a \u0152 a Russian visa. She actually went to the Russian consul, and she applied, and she left, and \u0152 and obviously the consul was Jewish. And he came running after her, and he told her, look, I can give you a Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 29 visa, I can guarantee that you can get into the country. I cannot guarantee that you will be allowed to leave. So my mother, you know, advice to the wise \u0152 wise, you only give once. So she tried then, going out through \u0152 through Spain , through \u0152 well, there were several problems in there. First of all, the Mexicans did not wish to give her the visa on anything but the Polish passport. And the Cubans wouldn\u2122t give her a transit visa either on \u0152 except on the Polish passport. She still had the valid Polish passport. I mean, Poland didn\u2122t exist, but she still had a valish por \u0152 Polish pa \u0152 of course, here the problem came to the rest of Europe . I mean, place like Switzerland , a place like Austria , a place like unoccupied France . To them Poland doesn\u2122t \u0152 did not exist anymore."

So my father\u2122s company, since they had such good relationship with the \u0152 with the Hungarian government, managed to get, for my mother, a [indecipherable] passport, a League of Nations passport. So, well she \u0152 she got herself into, you know, this is a complication. First you couldn\u2122t \u0152 at that time you couldn\u2122t travel with two passports. So one had to be very well hidden. So basically, she was \u0152 i-it took her a good six months, or seven months, to get all the transit visas there. The German transit visa through all \u0152 through then Germany , German Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 30 Austria, and you had to go through southern Germany , through M\u00fcnsing to Munich , to the Swiss border. And then you went across Switzerland to Geneva, and then you took a \u0152 a train across Vichy, France to [indecipherable] in Spain . The \u0152 the most difficult visa of them all was t he \u0152 was the French, the [indecipherable] government visa. She managed to \u0152 to get it. She \u0152 she was a very strong woman, and she wouldn\u2122t take no for an answer, so she managed to get everything together by about February of 1941. And we left for \u0152 for Spa in, and traveled through Germany . We managed to \u0152 to be in men \u0152 min \u0152 M\u00fcnsing , in Munich the night of the \u0152 of the speech of Hitler in the \u0152 in the beer \u0152 beer stuben (ph), in the beer \u0152 beer hall. And the British were bombing, and you know, being in the railroad station during a bombing is the wrong place to be. Anyways, noth \u0152 they did not bomb there. They were trying to get Hitler, so they bombed all of Munich , except for the railroad station. We got out of there, we got into Switzerland , we had to stay in Switzerland almost two weeks, I think. And then we went to Spain , and Spain was another problem, because Spain \u0152 this was the end of the civil war, and th-there was no food in Spain . So we were given the privilege to live in \u0152 in the hotel, which the Spanish government had for foreign dignitaries, which was not far from the Prado . So we stayed there til \u0152 til the boat that we were supposed to take, arrived in Vigo . We went to Vigo, we had a \u0152 a bad Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron May 8, 2013 31 experience there, too. My mother was a type which when she traveled, took everything with her. And imagine traveling to war torn Europe with 22 pieces of luggage, including two steamer trunks. She managed it. I mean no ha \u0152 anyways, in Spain , sh e made a \u0152 a terrible mistake. She met a Hungarian, and she said, you know, I worry about this and that and the other thing, because I took everything. I took my silver, I took my jewels, I took this, I took that, and everything is packed away in these 22 bags. So sure enough, it was a terrible mistake, because the guy went and spoke to the \u0152 to the Spanish customs. And we were already on the boat, and suddenly Spanish customs come up on the boat, and hold the boat, and they want to see my mother\u2122s bags. So they started opening bags, and my sister, in all innocence, she had a bar of chocolate, that we brought from Switzerland , and she offered it to the \u0152 to the inspector, to the Spanish customs inspector, you know, as a courtesy. Here, would you like to have this? Obviously the man hadn\u2122t seen a bar of chocolate in God knows when. He said, close up everything, we have nothing to do, we\u2122re just holding up the boat. Get out. So, you see, we were \u0152 we were saved by a bar of chocolate. But my mother was, in that sense, you know, very strange. She \u0152 she used to \u0152 people used to tell her, don\u2122t do this. She said, I\u2122ll do it, and I\u2122ll \u0152 I\u2122ll carry it through, and she \u0152 she was able to carry through almost anything that she undertook.

There was a movement in Mexico at that time called the \u0152 the Mexican traditionalist movement. And this was heavily anti-Semitic.
