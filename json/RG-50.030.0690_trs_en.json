Then there was something which 1s referred to historically as the Ugannah(ph). And basically what that was, it was a tax system which taxed artisans and industrialists, and didn\u2019t do very much for landowners, or others. So my father was pressed financially, and he gave up \u2014 basically they sold Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron , May 8, 2013 their factories in Poland, and the \u2014 they \u2014 my uncles remained, and they used to rent space in \u2014 in other factories, but my father, at first, moved to Finland. And that was a little bit too far from \u2014 from Poland. So he moved again to Zemun in \u2014 well, today it is Serbia. And in Serbia he had a bad experience, he ran in with a cousin of the king, who liked his business, so they gave him 72 hours to leave the country. And he had a \u2014 a number of jobs, until finally he \u2014 he found a job with a very big Hungarian complex called Csepel, that was run by a \u2014 a Jewish entrepreneur, Manfred George \u2014 actually, George Manfred.

And so my mother was very unhappy there, so she said \u2014 she s \u2014 when she found out that she was pregnant, she decided that she \u2014 this was not the place to deliver a child.

So they used to say yes, we want the fabric from Loden, and the name stuck. But he used to be a specialist, and one of the biggest problems that he had was raw material. He had to find [indecipherable] and th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the two or three plants where he was working consumed a huge amount of this, and specially these are the years where armies in \u2014 in Europe had to be dressed, and this was the basic coating material practically for everybody; for the German army, for the Polish army, for the \u2014 you name it.

            "answer": "Well, Pll \u2014 Ill tell you very truthfully, in Hungary there was so much latent anti-Semitism that with laws and without laws, it \u2014 it \u2014 it didn\u2019t change the situation very much. I was a little bit surprised at the question that I was asked, because curiously enough \u2014 and I spoke to my sister about this, it would seem that th-there was less talk of Hitler in Hungary, as there was more talk of Mussolini. So, some reason another, it was only in this corporate state was much more popular as a\u2014 as a piece of conversation, than Hitler. And anti-Semitism was latent. In \u2014 in \u2014 in the years before we left, where we didn\u2019t know where the outcome was, there was, you know, they were pe \u2014 recruiting Jewish young men, but some were sent to the army, some were sent to work camps. The work camps turned out to be pretty much extermination camps. I mean, they \u2014 they worked you to \u2014 to \u2014 to the bone, I think. There was a\u2014a movie called rou \u2014 Rosenschein(ph), or something like that, which described one of these work camps in \u2014 in Hungary. But basically, no-nobody heard anything. At least w-we \u2014 we weren\u2019t aware of it. And going to a German school, we were not very aware of it.

But no ma \u2014 he had \u2014 they had a relationship with the English company called John Crowther and Sons, in Milnsbridge, which supplied a lot of raw material too, but th-they were always starved for raw material. So my father decided that the only sizable place that he could think of that would have raw material was the United States. And basically, he also had there two brothers and a sister, which he hadn\u2019t seen in some 30 years. So he, you know, he figured all of these things together, my mother wouldn\u2019t go, because we had to go to school, and so forth, and so on. Those trips were long. And he \u2014 he planned to be away for a long, long, long period of time, because he had to set up this business. So he actually came to New York, and he \u2014 he set up a business in Passaic, New Jersey, and he spent here well over six months, I think about nine months, or something like that. And then he decided to go back to \u2014 to Europe, and he got as far as Belgium, and took the train to \u2014 to Berlin, but he was turned back, because the Germans had invaded Belgium. So, he basically got onto the same boat that he took to New York, and came back to New York.

I mean, as a child she had joined Hashomer Hatzair in Bialystok, which was not considered very \u2014 very Jewish, among the better \u2014 better members of the community, because they were the poorest of the poor, and the \u2014 the \u2014 they were definitely communistic. So, she had joined the Hashomer Hatzair, and of course, she in see \u2014 she was the only one that was living in the \u2014 1-in a decent housing area, all the meetings were held in her apartment, and my uncle used to absolutely blow his top.

She basically spoke very good German, and she looked German. She \u2014 she was blonde, blue eyed. Blue eyed to the point of gray eye. So she made friends in the German occupation forces, and she got herself a job as the doctor. She \u2014 she was still a medical student, but she was in her process of getting her internship, whatever it is. So she was able to get Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron oe May 8, 2013 herself a job at the Gestapo jail in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Prague, and she became the conduit between the people which were being held at the jail, and the underground and their families. And she did this til 1941, the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938. The university was closed, I think in November of 1938, because of strikes, student strikes. But she \u2014 she remained there, and she became an important cog 1n the communications system of the underground, with these people, until \u2014 until the end of 1941, when she suspected that she was compromised. In fact, we\u2019ve gone to the Holocaust Museum facilities, German files, and it\u2019s a fact. I mean, the Germans had her take \u2014 they had picked her up several times and let her go. But there was a\u2014a record that she had been caught at \u2014 as a Jewess not wearing a Jewish yellow Star of David. There were several reasons that she had been picked up, because she had managed to \u2014 she \u2014 she was extremely adroit at getting herself out of trouble. As a matter of fact, she got, at one point, papers, which Mr. Mousekopf(ph) didn\u2019t know it, but they were of a communist girl. And guess what? The Germans had her on the list of \u2014 of people that they \u2014 they had to \u2014 so she came \u2014 she was taken to Gestapo headquarters, she was taken to the Gestapo head. And she walks into her office \u2014 into his office, and she sees a picture behind his desk of Bialystok. So he \u2014 she didn\u2019t let him say hello, it\u2019s just \u2014 she says, you know, ho-how did you ever have this picture of Bialystok? So he says, well, you know, I was stationed there, I was Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron a May 8, 2013 the head of the Gestapo in Bialystok. So how \u2014 how were you related to Bialystok? She says, well, I\u2014 I belong to the German population of Bialystok, which \u2014 which were factory owners, and my father was a factory owner. And this is how I know Bialystok very well. My \u2014 my \u2014 my parents were still there for a while, I don\u2019t know where they are now, because the general \u2014 Generalgouvernement is not very informative as to where people are. So, you know, he made \u2014 she made a friendship, and when she walked in, she was about to be sent to wherever \u2014 God knows [indecipherable] was sent. She managed to walk out four hours later. And she managed also to \u2014 this false paper that she had, she managed to give it a certain aura of credibility. In other words, you know, he asked her, well, how come you are a communist? She says, you know, these were things of when you are a young ma \u2014 person, you \u2014 you think of other people, and this and that, and not of yourself. But this is something which is \u2014 which is gone past. So she managed to \u2014 to survive this way, on this set of papers, for close to three \u2014 three \u2014 well, more than that, she \u2014 she \u2014 she crossed the \u2014 the \u2014 she\u2019s crossed into Slovakia from \u2014 from the Czech Republic, from the other half, the night of Christmas of 1942. They figured that, and figured correctly that the German guards would be all drunk, having a Christmas party, and there was a huge snowstorm that night, but they managed to cross into Slovakia. Into Slovakia, they already had Mr. Mousekopf(ph) to help Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron o May 8, 2013 her, and she lived in Nitra from late 1941 to early 1944, til practically August, September of 1944. She \u2014 she had joined also, the Slovakian underground. There was a Slovakian uprising, I think in August \u2014 July or August of 1944, which was the reason that the Germans came in. They felt that the Slovakians couldn\u2019t handle this, so they came in, and they cleaned out the place, to their liking. My cousin, curiously enough, could have survived, but again, she \u2014 principle was \u2014 used to get her, and this time it got her, too. Was basically she \u2014 she \u2014 she tells that she was picked up by the Germans, taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and sat down with a group of Jews. And this man that she knew in the Gestapo walked in, and says, what are you doing sitting there? You\u2019re not Jewish. Go home. So she got up and went home, and she describes it as having had a terrible night. I mean, considering that the rest of the Jewish population was being done to something, and deported, or whatever it is. So she basically walked in the next morning, into Gestapo headquarters and said, you know, you\u2019re looking for Jews, I\u2019m Jewish. The man was floored. He never in his wildest dream imagined her to be Jewish. She was about as far physically from being a Jew as \u2014 as \u2014 as you can imagine. Of course, didn\u2019t \u2014 this didn\u2019t help her. But she helped other people. She took Mr. Mousekopf\u2019s(ph) wife and daughter. She \u2014 she \u2014 she was able to \u2014 she went to Birkenau, and in the same transport, Mr. Mousekopf\u2019s(ph) wife and daughter were \u2014 were in that same transport. Mr. Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron \u201c May 8, 2013 Mousekopf(ph) had been actually \u2014 was able to hide with some \u2014 some Catholic priest. And she \u2014 she told the people at Birkenau that she was a surgeon, she was a \u2014a doctor. So there was a shortage of doctors, not only for \u2014 for the inmates, but for actually the general population outside of the camps. So she was transported to Gross-Rosen, which was a satellite camp. And she said that she needed assistants. She was put in charge of a group of 200 agriculture workers, that were working in the fields around Gross-Rosen. So she said that, you know, she needed assistants. So she got the wife and daughter of \u2014 of this man Mousekopf(ph) to be her assistants, and all \u2014 all three survived the war. And she \u2014 she not only \u2014 she was actually taken by the camp commandant to his town in northern Germany, to see his mother, who was sick. And she says she could have stayed there. I mean, they liked her, they \u2014 they fed her, they \u2014 they clothed her, they \u2014 and \u2014 and they were very interested for her to stay around, because the mother seemed to be better with her being around. But she felt a responsibility, curiously enough, for those 200 people in Gross-Rosen, so she went back to the camps, and she stayed there til liberation, til \u2014 til May \u2014 May of 1945. Of course, we \u2014 we \u2014 we found out about her almost immediately. As liberation occurred, she was able to communicate with us, and we asked what happened to Mother and Father, and she says, we don\u2019t know. I lost total communications with her. I spoke to Vera(ph) the last time, which was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron \u201c\u00b0 May 8, 2013 end of 19 \u2014 1939, early 1940.

My father \u2014 my mother said, you know, what are you trying to do to me? I mean, I\u2019m perfectly happy here. Budapest is a nice, clean city, with no problems of any \u2014 any sort. So, basically, I actually think that somebody \u2014 a \u2014 a general, or maybe even a field https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron \u201c May 8, 2013 marshal \u2014 I mean, the German army, who was the buyer for the cloth for the German army, came to talk to my mother, and he told her, look, this is no \u2014 no time for a Jew to be in \u2014 in \u2014 in Europe, and you know the \u2014 this will take a year, two years, and everything will be settled again, everything will come into its normal course, and you\u2019ll come back. But at this point, this is no point \u2014 no time to \u2014 for a Jew to be in \u2014 in \u2014 1n Europe. Convinced her. The next problem was how to \u2014 how to travel. My father had arranged for her to \u2014 to take Verlichs(ph) out of Trieste \u2014 th-the ship out of Trieste to New York, there were two problems. First of all, she c- couldn\u2019t \u2014 she \u2014 she \u2014 it was very difficult to get a transit visa to the United States, which I think she finally got. But before she could leave, Mussolini got into the war, so that cut it off. Next thing is how to go when there \u2014 there were a lot of Jewish refugees who went to Russia. In other words, they \u2014 they took the Trans- Siberian to Vladivostok, from Vladivostok to \u2014 to San Francisco, or if not, from Vladivostok to Osaka, or Shanghai, and from there to \u2014 to San Francisco. So she figured that that made sense. I mean, Hungary has a border with \u2014 with Russia, and she hadn\u2019t seen her mother for, I don\u2019t know, 30 years, or 25 years, 30 years, so she would do both things. So she started to get a\u2014 a \u2014 a Russian visa. She actually went to the Russian consul, and she applied, and she left, and \u2014 and obviously the consul was Jewish. And he came running after her, and he told her, look, I can give you a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron \u201d May 8, 2013 visa, I can guarantee that you can get into the country. I cannot guarantee that you will be allowed to leave. So my mother, you know, advice to the wise \u2014 wise, you only give once. So she tried then, going out through \u2014 through Spain, through \u2014 well, there were several problems in there. First of all, the Mexicans did not wish to give her the visa on anything but the Polish passport. And the Cubans wouldn\u2019t give her a transit visa either on \u2014 except on the Polish passport. She still had the valid Polish passport. I mean, Poland didn\u2019t exist, but she still had a valish por \u2014 Polish pa \u2014 of course, here the problem came to the rest of Europe. I mean, place like Switzerland, a place like Austria, a place like unoccupied France. To them Poland doesn\u2019t \u2014 did not exist anymore."

So my father\u2019s company, since they had such good relationship with the \u2014 with the Hungarian government, managed to get, for my mother, a [indecipherable] passport, a League of Nations passport. So, well she \u2014 she got herself into, you know, this is a complication. First you couldn\u2019t \u2014 at that time you couldn\u2019t travel with two passports. So one had to be very well hidden.

The \u2014 the most difficult visa of them all was the \u2014 was the French, the [indecipherable] government visa. She managed to \u2014 to get it. She \u2014 she was a very strong woman, and she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, so she managed to get everything together by about February of 1941. And we left for \u2014 for Spain, and traveled through Germany. We managed to \u2014 to be in men \u2014 min \u2014 Miinsing, in Munich the night of the \u2014 of the speech of Hitler in the \u2014 in the beer \u2014 beer stuben(ph), in the beer \u2014 beer hall. And the British were bombing, and you know, being in the railroad station during a bombing 1s the wrong place to be. Anyways, noth \u2014 they did not bomb there. They were trying to get Hitler, so they bombed all of Munich, except for the railroad station. We got out of there, we got into Switzerland, we had to stay in Switzerland almost two weeks, I think. And then we went to Spain, and Spain was another problem, because Spain \u2014 this was the end of the civil war, and th-there was no food in Spain. So we were given the privilege to live in \u2014 in the hotel, which the Spanish government had for foreign dignitaries, which was not far from the Prado. So we stayed there til \u2014 til the boat that we were supposed to take, arrived in Vigo. We went to Vigo, we had a \u2014 a bad Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron * May 8, 2013 experience there, too. My mother was a type which when she traveled, took everything with her. And imagine traveling to war torn Europe with 22 pieces of luggage, including two steamer trunks. She managed it. I mean no ha \u2014 anyways, in Spain, she made a \u2014 a terrible mistake. She met a Hungarian, and she said, you know, I worry about this and that and the other thing, because I took everything. I took my silver, I took my jewels, I took this, I took that, and everything is packed away in these 22 bags. So sure enough, it was a terrible mistake, because the guy went and spoke to the \u2014 to the Spanish customs. And we were already on the boat, and suddenly Spanish customs come up on the boat, and hold the boat, and they want to see my mother\u2019s bags. So they started opening bags, and my sister, in all innocence, she had a bar of chocolate, that we brought from Switzerland, and she offered it to the \u2014 to the inspector, to the Spanish customs inspector, you know, as a courtesy. Here, would you like to have this? Obviously the man hadn\u2019t seen a bar of chocolate in God knows when. He said, close up everything, we have nothing to do, we\u2019re just holding up the boat. Get out. So, you see, we were \u2014 we were saved by a bar of chocolate. But my mother was, in that sense, you know, very strange.

The question is, were you a refugee, or weren\u2019t you a refugee? And even though we had come in not as a refugee, the Mexican government was, very, very friendly, and very open. There was a movement in Mexico at that time called the \u2014 the Mexican traditionalist movement. And this was heavily anti-Semitic. Basically their \u2014 the people who had been there earlier, had \u2014 had an awful lot of trouble, because Jews began monopolizing some of the downtown markets in Mexico City, and the Mexican \u2014 th-the people who had been in these stores, in \u2014 before, even though they sold out, they \u2014 it\u2019s not that they were pushed out, they were sold out, they \u2014 they started bearing a resentment, and this traditionalist movement was very unpleasant. In other words, they \u2014 they used to come to the boats, and used to have placards, and Jews go home, and don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t need you, and this and that and the other thing.

But th-there was always, you know, in \u2014 in \u2014 in [indecipherable] Catholic countries, Mexico was \u2014 it was always a lay \u2014 latent anti-Semitism.

And it \u2014 it \u2014 you know, my father start in a place called Pueblo, which was basically an extraordinarily Catholic city. Su-Super Catholic city. The reason for it, of course, 1s that there was not \u2014 there were a lot of old Spanish residents there. Not \u2014 the new Spanish were communists and Socialists, and whatever it is.

And it was strange, because you know, at \u2014 it \u2014 Hitler used to occupy the place of the Virgin of Guadalupe in the home. In other words, the \u2014 his place was above the mantle, and whatever it is. Fortunately, Germans were not \u2014 you know, didn\u2019t think very much about Mexicans, you know, they were just one chain below \u2014 below whatever they \u2014 they liked. So, I happen to know a lot of people, and especially in the German school system, at th-that time, before they closed it down. The man who had actually run the German school in Budapest was running the German school in \u2014 in Mexico, and \u2014 and he had been very friendly. As a matter of fact, there was another couple of Jewish boys which had been in Budapest as well, which lived in Mexico, and this man wanted us to go \u2014 go \u2014 all go into the German school, because he needed the native German speakers, and couldn\u2019t find them in Mexico. So, my mother didn\u2019t want to, and the Mexican government was helpful enough in closing down the \u2014 the German school, because the embassy was \u2014 was playing games. But it was amazing to me, because th-the Mexican kids were handled very badly by the Germans, you know, with \u2014 no matter what their social condition was, they were really treated like second class citizens. Curiously, we were not. I mean, we were there maybe for a week, or two weeks, or whatever it 1s, but we were not \u2014 not treated like \u2014 like second class citizens at all.
