I don\u2122t know how lucky I was that the doctor that we had in Holland told them that I could not be moved. And I by a miracle they let me stay. I stayed in bed from months at a time, putting white powder on my face to tell people that I was sick. I had to be afraid of my neighbors because some of my Jewish neighbors were taken away and here I was as a young girl, 20. In bed. My mother did everything. She, I would not get out of bed. My mother took care of the house as sick as she was. And like I said it\u2122s a miracle that they didn\u2122t\u2122 come after me at another time.

They are absolutely the most wonderful people who never hurt a fly. They were ladies of m eans. My grandfather was an antique dealer. And I will go with them. He volunteered to go with them. Not knowing that he was never with them because I found out later through the Red Cross that as soon as they came to Auschwitz that they were killed immed iately. And but my brother who went was young, he was 11 years older than I was. He was sent to work camp. And I don\u2122t\u2122 know where he died but I know that he lived through I guess work camps, concentration camps, til the end. And he died either in Bad wamvorn which I guess is a work camp or in Auschwitz. I am not sure. But he died of typhoid of probably two days before he was liberated.

I don\u2122t know what happened. They must have felt so sorry for us. That they let us stay. People were taken away and people disappeared. We did not know what happened. My father had a friend in another city. He also was a cattle dealer and he said, I don\u2122t know how they got together. He said how come that people are disappearing and he said if you go to the post office and there is a gentleman and you ask for his ficti tious name, Mr. Jansen, he will tell him that you want to speak with him. We had been moved from our single house to a house that had a lot of stores and a lot of rooms and they put all of us Jewish people there together.

Well of course it was very difficult to find houses, to find places for us to go. He got in touch with us. It must have been before another transport came. And he had found one place for the three of us but we nev er wanted to be together because if we were found the whole family would have been destroyed.

I, I can\u2122t tell you. I really don\u2122t remember.

We had to leave early in the morning. I don\u2122t\u2122 remember. We had to go up the hill, but that was during a time that we were not allowed on the street . We had to wear our star. And we walked up the hill where he came with a car and took us away. You left everything, everything you owned. Everything you had you just left behind because all you had were what you wore and a few things I guess clothing that he took. I remember coming to this place and it was a coal miner where we, where he wanted us to stay. It was a very small townhouse and the person made secur e to tell the neighbors that she was getting company for the weekend."

And this is where Mr. Jansen was able to place us. Here, but I\u2122m coming back to go to the Robertsons\u2122 house. The Robertson house was on a road that was between two, not cities, two small towns and they have never gotten together. Who\u2122s going to put in electricity. Who\u2122s going to put in water supply. We didn\u2122t have any water supply except for a well in the back yard. And there was no electricity. We only had kerosene and the only heating place in the house was the stove in the kitchen. It was very primitive but the people were absolutely wonderful. I stayed there and we had another lady German Jewish from Heidelberg. She was used to a lot of money. Her parents had a cigar factory. And she was, she had a hard time being, adjusting, being the person. Nobody. You are absolutely a nobody. You are at the mercy of people. If they\u2122re good to you then it\u2122s fine. If not, it\u2122s a hard time and a different way of life. Don\u2122t forget a little carafe of water had to last us for one week. I slept with Katie in a single bed. When she turned I had to turn. When I turned she Interview with Ruth Greifer 46 had to turn. Our linens was washed. The bed linens were washed every two months. Because they would hang the clothes out and people would probably watch how often you wash. So they were used to washing once a month so once a month this bed was being changed and the next month this bed was being changed. Our clothing wasn\u2122t changed for at least once a week. And like I said our water, we had a little carafe that had to last us one week. But look, you do anything to keep your life. I was asked once did you make plans. When you were in hiding and they were so amazed. I said no I didn\u2122t make any plans because I didn\u2122t know if I was going to live the next day or the next morning or the next minute. Because I didn\u2122t know where I was going to be. I didn\u2122t know what was going to happen to us if I ever survived. We couldn\u2122t tell. The people were very good to us. The food was ample. We ate probably potatoes three times a day which was fine."

And here we are. There\u2122s the kitchen and here is the French door. And here is a round table and we could not get out of that room to go upstairs. The poor soul asked these German soldiers in the kitchen entertained them, gave them coffee, gave whatever she had and she probably knew that we were in the adjacent room. The adjacent room had a round table and long table cloth. Under the table Interview with Ruth Greifer 48 in the next room. You don\u2122t know how frightened we were. You don\u2122t know how scared we were. If we had coughed, that would have been the end of us. They would have said who is in there. Let\u2122s go see. Because they\u2122re aware. They knew that people were in hiding and they knew exactly what was going on. You don\u2122t\u2122 know the fright and how scared we were. I don\u2122t know. it probably lasted three days to us but it didn\u2122t last that long. I don\u2122t\u2122 remember how long it lasted. But thank god we survived that particular incident. You had to live. They had to live a normal life. And just fill in because people knew exactly how they lived. Friday mornings she would go into town and buy her groceries. I mean everything had to be just so. The clothes that were hung out had to be just normal. Not more, not one piece more than another because people in small towns know exactly what the next person does. I really don\u2122t remember how long I stayed with them. Until I had to leave again. And I don\u2122t know if they got scared of us. You know there\u2122s just so much time that you can spend with a person that\u2122s a fugitive. I absolutely was a fugitive in that house."

And I crawled into the potato bin and I don\u2122t know how often I sat in that potato bin. And how long I sat in th at potato bin. Because when the Americans came to liberate us the house was in front of a big coal pile. And the Germans would sit on this side and shoot over your house and Americans came across. It was a big field. I\u2122ll never forget the Americans came a cross with their tanks and infantry. And we were told to stay in the basement because we didn\u2122t\u2122 know who was going to stay. Who was going to be pushed back. And I know that a, some of the American soldiers got hurt. But do you know that we were afraid t o come out of the basement for days.
