There was a knock on our door and they would come and to get me. In the meantime, I was sick. I got sick. I don\u2019t know how lucky I was that the doctor that we had in Holland told them that I could not be moved. And I by a miracle they let me stay. I stayed in bed from months at a time, putting white powder on my face to tell people that I was sick. I had to be afraid of my neighbors because some of my Jewish neighbors were taken away and here I was as a young girl, 20. In bed. My mother did everything. She, I would not get out of bed. My mother took care of the house as sick as she was. And like I said it\u2019s a miracle that they didn\u2019t\u2019 come after me at another time. But in the meantime my two maiden aunts were taken away in Maastricht. My brother said I\u2019m not going to let these ladies go by themselves. They\u2019re very frail. They\u2019re old. They are absolutely the most wonderful people who never hurt a fly. They were ladies of means. My grandfather was an antique dealer. And I will go with them. He volunteered to go with them. Not knowing that he was never with them because I found out later through the Red Cross that as soon as they came to Auschwitz that they were killed immediately. And but my brother who went was young, he was 11 years older than I was. He was sent to work camp. And I don\u2019t\u2019 know where he died but I know that he lived through I guess work camps, concentration camps, til the end. And he died either in Badwamvorn which I guess is a work camp or in Auschwitz. I am not sure. But he died of typhoid of probably two days before he was liberated.

I don\u2019t know what happened. They must have felt so sorry for us. That they let us stay. People were taken away and people disappeared. We did not know what happened. My father had a friend in another city. He also was a cattle dealer and he said, I don\u2019t know how they got together. He said how come that people are disappearing and he said if you go to the post office and there is a gentleman and you ask for his fictitious name, Mr. Jansen, he will tell him that you want to speak with him. We had been moved from our single house to a house that had a lot of stores and a lot of rooms and they put all of us Jewish people there together. So if they had another raid that they didn\u2019t have to go from house to house. That we were just all there. I don\u2019t\u2019 know how they moved me. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember anything but I remember having been moved to this house where all these storefronts were changed into places for us to live. Well my father went to Mr. Jansen and he told us that he could help us. that he would help us to go in hiding, if we were willing to and my father said anything, anything you can do for us he did. Well of course it was very difficult to find houses, to find places for us to go. He got in touch with us. It must have been before another transport came. And he had found one place for the three of us but we never wanted to be together because if we were found the whole family would have been destroyed. The man came to our house and at night and got some, I guess my mother had suitcases ready with a few little things for us to wear. I don\u2019t\u2019 even remember what I wore, what I had. I, I can\u2019t tell you. I really don\u2019t remember. But I know that he came the night before or a couple nights Interview with Ruth Greifer 38 before and picked up a couple of suitcases and he said yes he had secured a place for us. We had to leave early in the morning. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember. We had to go up the hill, but that was during a time that we were not allowed on the street. We had to wear our star. And we walked up the hill where he came with a car and took us away. You left everything, everything you owned. Everything you had you just left behind because all you had were what you wore and a few things I guess clothing that he took. I remember coming to this place and it was a coal miner where we, where he wanted us to stay. It was a very small townhouse and the person made secure to tell the neighbors that she was getting company for the weekend."

And this is where Mr. Jansen was able to place us. Here, but \u2019m coming back to go to the Robertsons\u2019 house. The Robertson house was on a road that was between two, not cities, two small towns and they have never gotten together. Who\u2019s going to put in electricity. Who\u2019s going to put in water supply. We didn\u2019t have any water supply except for a well in the back yard. And there was no electricity. We only had kerosene and the only heating place in the house was the stove in the kitchen. It was very primitive but the people were absolutely wonderful. I stayed there and we had another lady German Jewish from Heidelberg. She was used to a lot of money. Her parents had a cigar factory. And she was, she had a hard time being, adjusting, being the person. Nobody. You are absolutely a nobody. You are at the mercy of people. If they\u2019re good to you then it\u2019s fine. If not, it\u2019s a hard time and a different way of life. Don\u2019t forget a little carafe of water had to last us for one week. I slept with Katie in a single bed. When she turned I had to turn. When I turned she Interview with Ruth Greifer 46 had to turn. Our linens was washed. The bed linens were washed every two months. Because they would hang the clothes out and people would probably watch how often you wash. So they were used to washing once a month so once a month this bed was being changed and the next month this bed was being changed. Our clothing wasn\u2019t changed for at least once a week. And like I said our water, we had a little carafe that had to last us one week. But look, you do anything to keep your life. I was asked once did you make plans. When you were in hiding and they were so amazed. I said no I didn\u2019t make any plans because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to live the next day or the next morning or the next minute. Because I didn\u2019t know where I was going to be. I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us if I ever survived. We couldn\u2019t tell. The people were very good to us. The food was ample. We ate probably potatoes three times a day which was fine."

And here we are. There\u2019s the kitchen and here is the French door. And here is a round table and we could not get out of that room to go upstairs. The poor soul asked these German soldiers in the kitchen entertained them, gave them coffee, gave whatever she had and she probably knew that we were in the adjacent room. The adjacent room had a round table and long table cloth. Under the table Interview with Ruth Greifer 48 in the next room. You don\u2019t know how frightened we were. You don\u2019t know how scared we were. If we had coughed, that would have been the end of us. They would have said who is in there. Let\u2019s go see. Because they\u2019re aware. They knew that people were in hiding and they knew exactly what was going on. You don\u2019t\u2019 know the fright and how scared we were. I don\u2019t know. it probably lasted three days to us but it didn\u2019t last that long. I don\u2019t\u2019 remember how long it lasted. But thank god we survived that particular incident. You had to live. They had to live a normal life. And just fill in because people knew exactly how they lived. Friday mornings she would go into town and buy her groceries. I mean everything had to be just so. The clothes that were hung out had to be just normal. Not more, not one piece more than another because people in small towns know exactly what the next person does. I really don\u2019t remember how long I stayed with them. Until I had to leave again. And I don\u2019t know if they got scared of us. You know there\u2019s just so much time that you can spend with a person that\u2019s a fugitive. I absolutely was a fugitive in that house."

And I crawled into the potato bin and I don\u2019t know how often I sat in that potato bin. And how long I sat in that potato bin. Because when the Americans came to liberate us the house was in front of a big coal pile. And the Germans would sit on this side and shoot over your house and Americans came across. It was a big field. I\u2019ll never forget the Americans came across with their tanks and infantry. And we were told to stay in the basement because we didn\u2019t\u2019 know who was going to stay. Who was going to be pushed back. And I know that a, some of the American soldiers got hurt. But do you know that we were afraid to come out of the basement for days.
