            "question": "I wanted to get some sense of what life was like for you when you were growing up. So, first let\u2122s talk about your family.",
            "answer": "All right, I will tell you about my family first, but before I start, I wanted to say something why I am here and why I was hesitating for a long time to tell my story. The reason was because it\u2122s not the typical story of the Holocaust. I was not in a concentration camp. It is my life during the Nazis outside. It is actually a story of faith, all about faith, hope, courage, think about all miracles. I want to bring it out in this story, that if you believe in it or not, miracles still exist. Now, you want to hear a bout my family, correct? I, we have been six. Originally, we had a brother died before I was born, and other sister. I am the youngest in my family. I have a sister Berthe. She\u2122s the oldest . Then I have sister Fanny (ph) she is \u0152 she comes after. I adored Fanny. She was \u0152 had charisma. She was outgoing. She was beautiful. Sometimes I wonder how I admired her so that I di dn\u2122t resent it in that I wasn\u2122t jealous. For instance, coming back, all my family was very good in mathematics. My father was almost a genius in that field. She was excellent, but I wasn\u2122t very good mathematics. I was the best in physics. But I never reached Fanny, you understand, and the teacher would always say when I was a little kid, \ufb01You are good, but not like your sister Fanny.\ufb02 I didn\u2122t resent her. I loved her, and it is actually strange. Then, I had brother. He was known \u0152 he was an excellent chess player, and what he did \u0152 Fanny had a doctorate in chemistry, th e other sister just told you \u0152 he was in business with stamps. He was a stamp collector, but it was really, it was his business, and then he was excellent chess player, they called him from all Europe (ph). And then there were myself. That it is about the stor y. We grew up in Vienna. Vienna is one of the 3 most beautiful cities. I love Vienna. I\u2122d go b ack to Vienna, and people sometimes resent it, coming from the Nazis. Vienna was occupied \u0152 why do you go back? I did not know at first. I was thinking, \ufb01Why do I go back?\ufb02 I found out I go \u0152 if I would not go back, if I would be afraid, it would be a victory of Hitler. This city didn\u2122t belong to him. It was part of me. I grew up there with my father and my mother my sisters. I went to school. I was so happy there and I want to keep it. So, I go back whenever I have some money left. I go back, enjoy the street, enjoy the schools. That is about. Do you want me to talk about other things like schools?"

            "question": "About what it was like in your home. What\u2122s your earliest memory as a child?",
            "answer": "What is my earliest memory as a child? You will laugh, but I sort of remember when we celebrated a Jewish holiday. I mu st have been very little, and my father was sitting was sitting there and this was a Seder, and that he had a pillow sitting it. I had a feeling he is not really there, he was so involved, but not my mother. He was so involved and at times, I asked my mother, \ufb01Is father God himself?\ufb02 I was so little, maybe three or four years old, but it made that kind of impression. My life was ve ry lively. We were four children. As you can imagine, I was the youngest, real ly the youngest. My oldest sister Berthe was like a mother to me, and I always thought, well, she tried to boss me around, but it was not easy, and I thought very often, \ufb01One day I will be older than all of you, and then I will be the boss!\ufb02 And they adored me, but suddenly, nobody expected th at there was a little girl here. And I was actually spoiled, but not spoiled, because if you hear my story and what developed and how I developed, you have to tell yourself, maybe it doesn\u2122t hurt if you spoil somebody. Vienna 4 was beautiful. Vienna was a city everybody would like to go. There was art. They describe it in the books; later it came out. There is no other city in Europe that you have at the same time, the most famous writer, the most famous artists, the most famous composers. There was like music in the air. Now, when I go back, I hear it. I walk on the Chancellor Strasse \u0152 people are playing the violin, people are singing. It\u2122s a different world. When people sometimes visit Vienna now, and they come back and they say something like, \ufb01I was a little bit disappointed, the way you describe it.\ufb02 I cannot understand it. They did not feel what I feel. They do not see the city like I see it."

            "answer": "Oh, yes, yes. That was three or \u0152 I would say definitely. I tell you, father and mother were very different. My father, everything meant to him \u0152 study, learn, work. He says he can take very interest because he can do \u0152 they can ta ke everything away from you, but your learning, it will always stay with you. And I remember when I studied, all the schools, they were very strict, especially when I had the medical exams. I took the street car. He would be \u0152 he did not know when I would be coming home. He wo uld wait hours to find out, \ufb01Did you pass it? Did you pass it?\ufb02 Yes, I was close, but it was everything was learning. To a certain extent, I was closer to my mother even. She was more practical. She wanted me to have nice clothes to have \u0152 to have \u0152 father just wanted to have it all, too, but all in that picture of learning. Both were very different, my father and my mother. It was a good marriage."

That was the \u0152 my father was always \u0152 here a bout to stress it (ph) \u0152 he was unusual. He was unusual, then I would say he was almost like a genius when it came to mathematics. He didn\u2122t have a formal training, and he could serve, he could help us with any kind, the hardest problems there was. He would know how to so lve it. He, himself sometimes, he couldn\u2122t explain it to me how he did it. He hadn\u2122t learned it, but he came to it. Fanny, that sister, was to a certain extent like that. Then, I do not know. I had a brother, Benjamin \u0152 he died when he was 10. I was not born yet. And, they would tell stories \u0152 none of us children were like him. They would tell stories about him, how brillia nt like as an infant he was. He would read something. He read the Torah. He knew the w hole thing by heart. How kind and good, gentle people would talk to him. Years after he passed by, there was still, I was told, on his grave from some gentle people a note \ufb01Here lies Benjam in\ufb02 and a few words that would describe it."

You grow olde r, you lose sometimes somebody, but I would still say Mahkta (ph), she was my best friend. Funny, I would not say my sister, she was my best friend. I had friends. I was very popular, and I belong to youth groups that the called Maccabi, Blau Weiss. It was very oriented, but you had wanted to belong to something, and like I was a wonderful gymnast, and I belonged to the \u0152 you know, we were divided in row \u0152 I belonged to the first row, and we would travel through the blau weiss, through the maccabi, and here I was always little and short, and I was there. Here I have to tell you a true story. When you went to the maccabi and to exercise and to jump and to \u0152 the people watching \u0152 young kids watching, see who is good, who is not good, in a large gallery. I had a girlfriend and she was there, too. I was told years later when I started to - I must have 10, 11 years old \u0152 and I started to go out with Eddie, and hoping he will marry me one day \u0152 my friend Danie (ph) said, \ufb01Well, you achieved your goal.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01What do you mean?\ufb02 She said, \ufb01Don\u2122t you remember? When we were little girls, you looke d at him, and you said, \u201aThis is the boy I\u2122m going to marry. This is a boy I want to marry.\u2122 \ufb02 And, so, I married him, but it wasn\u2122t hard. He went to medical school, and Eddie was so, he was known as one of the best looking guy 7 of that. Sometimes I was wondering, maybe it woul d have been easier, if he wouldn\u2122t have been so good-looking, because he was quite arrogant. Forgive me, Eddie, but lovable."

My children would get upset when I said it. It\u2122s a shame. I pay so much money, you go only half the time you go to school, because in Vienna, Austria, you go six days to school. You go to mornings and afternoon. It\u2122s not five days. Vacation all that you have is two months. You have here 8 four months, and all the holidays. That was actually helpful because then you studied, you were much younger when you went to the university because we crammed it in a shorter period."

They were not Nazis, we were children. I have very good friends, very good friends. Certain people who helped us afterward, it\u2122s unreal \u0152 you have to see that picture.

That Fanny, that my father wanted her to be a physician, she came back from anatomy. She was supposed to dissect. She saw the cadaver, comes home, and says to my father, \ufb01You can ha ve it, not me.\ufb02 And that was the end. She really started afterwards. She got a doctorat e in chemistry and pharmacy, but not medicine. Then, by and by, when I heard it, that that was a dream of my father , I didn\u2122t tell anybody yet, but by time developed for me, I wanted to be that physician, and so I started to \u0152 I really was very much, but it goes with medicine \u0152 ve ry much interested in physics. I was the best _____ than anybody else, and I had a dream maybe I will be an engineer. I could build bridges and this, but that was unheard in Vienna. I would have never, never had chance. You can\u2122t even dream, as a woman, to choose that fi eld. I said to my father when I was much older, \ufb01I think I\u2122m going to try about to be a physician.\ufb02 Well, it didn\u2122t bother me whatsoever. I dissected. I worked as hard. I loved it, actually. And that is the story. I always tell one story about one thing only that bothered me once. Yo u know, in Europe, exams were very strict especially pre-medical subjects, anatomy and physiology and all of them. The people would get, I hope it won\u2122t make you sic k, cadavers who will pay for it, and you would dissect it. It would give you experience that what find this artery and it will give you experience. And here I was so young, and I\u2122ll never forget, I had paid in and I couldn\u2122t go down there to the anatomy in the daytime. I went down, and it was the evening. Until today, I haven\u2122t forgotten! That\u2122s why I\u2122m bringing it up. They were all laying around dead, and 15 covered, and all that you could see were just th e feet. I know it\u2122s probably foolish that I mention it, but it wasn\u2122t foolish at that time fo r me. So, I started medi cine and got finished.

People said, \ufb01Don\u2122t be foolish. He won\u2122t send you anything.\ufb02 I wrote him a letter. I described to him the situation. I described Eddie, who my fianc\u00e9, who is, a long letter, as a medical student and so on. I was walking very close to the university where I wasn\u2122t allowed to work, but I was walking. And I was walking from the Rathaus, the city hall, a gorgeous building in this, all insults. Suddenly, somebody put their arm around me , which is strange. Christians are afraid to touch you, you understand? It\u2122s a Jew. I tu rn around. Who was it? Mu riel. And she said, \ufb01Leney, I\u2122m glad I saw you.\ufb02 I hadn\u2122t seen he r in maybe a year or longer. I do not know. And, like again, I had no idea who she was, that she was rich or people she ________ nothing. \ufb01How are you?\ufb02 And I said to her, \ufb01D on\u2122t you know the situation? I\u2122m desperate.\ufb02 And started to cry. And she said, \ufb01Yes, I understa nd it. I\u2122m going to leav e here. I\u2122m going to 39 France because I cannot stand it here either myself.\ufb02 Even though she was not Jewish, and then she said to me, \ufb01Leney, I have sent out so many affidavits.\ufb02 You know what an affidavit is. \ufb01To so many people. I don\u2122t think they woul d accept anything from me anymore, but if I can help you anyway, tell me.\ufb02 Here, again, I had no idea that she was one of the richest people in the country, and I think for a moment and I sa id, \ufb01You know, Muriel, maybe you can help me.\ufb02 She said, \ufb01What is it Leney?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I wrote a letter to my cousin, Sam Menczel, in German. My English is no good. C ould you translate it?\ufb02 \ufb01Oh, sure. Come up to my apartment.\ufb02 Next day I come up to Muriel. I realize suddenly that she must be very wealthy \u0152 not that arrogant or anything, just the neighborhood, where it was. Went up to her apartment, and met here that lit tle girl, that Connie, and she sits down and took the long \u0152 it was a very long letter writing to Sam Menczel. She was \u0152 after she was done, she leads to her door and she looks at me. She had tears in her eyes, and she says \u0152 mind you, she practically did not know me only from that lect ure to that time \u0152 tears in her eyes, and she says, \ufb01Leney, if there\u2122s anything I can help you, please get \u0152 I\u2122m leaving for a few days. I give you my address. It\u2122s American Express in Paris. Wh erever I go, they will send the mail to me.\ufb02 And, she \u0152 I remember that. \ufb01And I will travel back again. I can\u2122t send affida vit, nothing.\ufb02 I sent the letter on \u0152 her letter that she translated on to my cousin in New York. Weeks passed, I didn\u2122t hear. Suddenly, I got a letter. I have that letter after so many years. I get a letter from him. \ufb01Dear Leney\ufb02, he said, \ufb01I read your story. I was so touched, what you made from your life. I\u2122m going to \u0152 I want to help you. I\u2122m goi ng to send you an affidavit, and I will \u0152 I will be good to you. My wife, Rosie, and the childr en will love you, and forget your boyfriend or fianc\u00e9. I cannot. I\u2122m not rich enough. I can\u2122t send him some papers , but looking at your picture and that you are a doctor or become a doctor, you won\u2122t have a hard time, you will 40 find somebody else who will love you.\ufb02 I was so happy with the letter, yes and no because Eddie \u0152 at the moment \u0152 I mean, from Heaven, su ch a letter. I carry that letter wherever I go, but one thing was clear to me. I will not leave wi thout him, without Eddie. I\u2122d rather die. I don\u2122t care at all. So, I got this letter and a few weeks agai n pass, trying to make some connection for him. Impossible, I didn\u2122t fi nd anybody. Suddenly, I get a call, who was it? Muriel. Who was it? Muriel. And again, I knew r eally nothing except for th at one lecture that I saved her a seat. Muriel, she said to me, \ufb01L eney, did you hear from your cousin?\ufb02 \ufb01Yes. But he\u2122s not going to send anything to Eddie, a nd I\u2122m not leaving without him.\ufb02 She thinks a minute, and she says, \ufb01Leney, don\u2122t despair.\ufb02 I was a stranger to her. \ufb01Don\u2122t despair Even if I sent so many affidavits \u0152 wait, wait, help wi ll come.\ufb02 A few days passed, Muriel called again. \ufb01Leney, Eddie has affidavit. I didn\u2122t have to send anything. I called up. I talked with the ambassador, and an affidavit is there.\ufb02 S o, you can imagine. The world was ours. The world was ours. I mean, was it really true th at just a few weeks there was nothing? And I now had to wait for a certain number. Even w ith the affidavit, you cannot go to the United States. Your number has to come up. It wa s a quota. There was a quote \u0152 from the number way back. They were not ready for us yet. We had to wait."

Th ey are believed to be write out, but you have to show proof of support, that you have the means, that I will not be a burden to the States until I\u2122m a citizen."

            "question": "No, no, it\u2122s fine. Let me ask you again. Explain what an affidavit is. 42",
            "answer": "An affidavit is you have to find someone \u0152 it doe s not have to be a relative \u0152 who\u2122s willing to send you papers to go to the United States, and the papers has to show what he owns, income tax and so on \u0152 that he\u2122s really, if it comes to it, that he\u2122s able to support me, and that I will never be a burden to the United States as long as I\u2122m not a citizen anymore, because if I\u2122m a citizen, it is expected that I support myself if I\u2122m able. So, Muriel sent me that affidavit, but \u0152 not Muriel, Sam Menczel; Muriel sent it for Eddie \u0152 but you had to wait for a quota number. There\u2122s only \u0152 somebody might send somebody a hundred affidavits and only a certain number are allowed to enter every year to th e United States, and there it was important from which country you came from. For instance, if you came from Scandinavia, it was very easy to enter. They will give you numbers because Scandinavian people had no interest to go to the United States. So, we had to wait for our numbers. And so, it was very hard until you get to it. I got right off. I got the numbers, but th e Germans had to give me all the permission to get that number that I\u2122m clear. I have all th e \u0152 did I tell you the story how I worked as a maid?"

They did not want to give me that number yet, so one man who had looked over the income tax, \ufb01I have a mother. She\u2122s old. She\u2122s sick. If you find me, if you arrive, you will work for me as a maid, when she\u2122s all done, maybe I will let you go and your family.\ufb02 So, I took the job and it was a nightmare . She was so mean to me. I worked day and night. She was very sick and didn\u2122t give me pr actically anything to eat, but God help me she 43 died after three months. So, that was fine. He went into Eddie\u2122s apartment, took out the nicest furniture he wanted to, and said, \ufb01Now you have the numbers, too.\ufb02 And, he also \u0152 Eddie, not me."

            "question": "Where were you in Switzerland?",
            "answer": "I tell you, I was in different places. I was because wherever they would let you in. I was in Davos, Switzerland. I stayed two days in Zurich. I started to hide. Then I was in Geneva, I\u2122ll tell you why. The visa came to an end soon, my Swiss visa. I promised I would be out of 46 Switzerland. Here I was caught. I couldn\u2122t go back to Vienna. The Swiss didn\u2122t let me there because they prolonged it once, and that was the end. I didn\u2122t know what to do. I tried \u0152 I started to hide. My brother was either in Reins or someplace called me and said, \ufb01You have to get out. They won\u2122t let you.\ufb02 But I did not know what, so he said, \ufb01Look, I will tell you all this on the phone, let me tell you what to do.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Take your belongings.\ufb02 I didn\u2122t have much, \ufb01Go to Geneva. There is a League of Nations in Geneva. There is a very prominent lawyer. You go down there. He might not want to do a thing for you, but he has it in his power. If he wants to, he will help you.\ufb02 I t ook like my last money. I went to Geneva. Don\u2122t ask me, I don\u2122t know why I\u2122m there. I do not kno w. I come to Geneva. I find the telephone number where the prominent lawyer is, had a hard time to get in. He didn\u2122t want to talk to me. How I did it, I do not know. I reached him. I talked to him. He was very touched. I don\u2122t know \u0152 people were somehow taken by me. It\u2122s ju st \u0152 So, he said, \ufb01I will help you.\ufb02 Yeah, my brother said to me, \ufb01Look if nobody helps you there, the League of Nations, you have to go illegally. You have to go over the border. It could take you days until you get there. There mountains, mountain passes. There are woods. You will have to hike. If the Swiss find you, there\u2122s no end to it. They will send you right back.\ufb02 The idea that I should be as thin as I was and there was nothing but me, all by myself, scared stiff. Well, I talked to that lawyer. He called up a very prominent, very high official at the League of Nations. I understood French some. I did not understand quite enough to unde rstand while he was talking, and he said, \ufb01You have to help her. You have to see her. Do what you want, but you have to talk to her.\ufb02 She didn\u2122t want to talk to me. He was pleading with her. She agreed. I think they were probably very close with each other. I go over to the League of Nations. I have no idea anymore did I walk, I had no money for that. I got there. I meet her, fantastic building, very 47 elegant woman. She was awfully nice to me. Sh e took a look at me, and she said to me, \ufb01Don\u2122t talk at all. Did you eat yet?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01No.\ufb02 She rings a little bell. They bring in a fabulous breakfast with orange juice and all this. I thought it was not here, it was heaven. She said, \ufb01Yes, I will help you. I will give you a te mporary visa you will get to go to France.\ufb02 And she said she will give me to a _____ so I was relatively safe for a short period. In the meantime, the war broke out. Poland and Germany, the borders were closed, and I did not need to go out right now, but Eddie called me. He said, \ufb01Leney, I received my \u0152 I have my visa. I have the number.\ufb02 I told you that be fore. \ufb01I have everything. What will you do now? Your number is up. If you don\u2122t come to Vie nna in two, three days, your number will be given to somebody else.\ufb02 So, you realize the tremendous problem, not going back to Vienna meant I would never be with Eddie again, becau se he\u2122s going to the United States and I wouldn\u2122t. I didn\u2122t have it. Going to Vienna was a tremendous danger, almost 100 percent. They would send me right off into concentr ation camp. \ufb01You have signed it. You have signed it.\ufb02 I talk my friends, she wouldn\u2122t want to hide me in order to force me not to go back. I said, \ufb01I have nothing to lose. I will tr y to go back.\ufb02 And here comes the story about going back. As far as I knew, I will not be able to make it because the Germans will send me right off into the concentration camp. Now, I n eeded in order to go back, I needed a visa, a German visa, to enter Vienna from Switzerland. Well, I think, \ufb01Let me try.\ufb02 I get my stuff together, go to Zurich, and I go to the consulate \u0152 a tremendous, big building, a lot of people are waiting there in front to get in, maybe a hundred or more, but this \u0152 none of them were Jewish. These were all gentile people who had business, who wanted to go back, everybody needed a visa. They were standing. It was not open yet. They were standing in line for quite a while. Suddenly a Gestapo man, an SS man, comes out , but he says first, \ufb01Heil Hitler, heil 48 Hitler.\ufb02 Everybody in the group, \ufb01Heil Hitler, heil Hitler\ufb02 and he says, \ufb01I have to give you a message.\ufb02 He says, \ufb01You all can go home. Yesterda y they tried to assass inate Hitler.\ufb02 And he called him the Furor. If you said the Furor, this is the highest word in stead of Hitler. \ufb01The Furor has given orders nobody\u2122s allowed to en ter the border anymore. To go out, not \u201atil you hear from me at a later date , I do not know when. The people all went home. Within seconds that tremendous place was empty. The only pers on who was standing there was myself, and two of the Nazis, the higher officials, Gestapos. \ufb01What do you want?\ufb02 You get like so rigid. You do not know what to do, what is happening. You act, or you don\u2122t act. So, what should I do? No gentile, no Christian, nobody can get in. I\u2122 m frightened to death, but I had only one desire. I want to be with Eddie. If I can\u2122t be with Eddie, I mi ght as well die. And I thought and I thought. I had to get in. I started march to the door. Nobody\u2122s marching with me anymore. Everybody left. And I see the big door and SS men, Gestapo, all these women screaming \ufb01Heil Hitler, heil Hitler. \ufb02 Standing straight. I went up to the door that I did almost consciously, I shouldn\u2122t be scared. I should walk straight like I would look like I know where I was going to. I had no idea where the consul was. I had no idea how he looked, nothing. And, I was sure that they\u2122d send me back at the door, nobody can get in. I mean, I\u2122m on German territory. I walk straight to the door, gr ab the door, and open it. I did it so fast that it didn\u2122t occur. It probably looked like I am one from them. I was just \ufb01In I am. In I am.\ufb02 Tremendous building, no idea should I go right? Should I go left? Shoul d I go straight? Let\u2122s see, which one could it be? I do not know. I go straight and I start walking \u0152 walk, walk, walk \u0152 suddenly I come to a big door, and I thoug ht to myself, \ufb01It looks very impressive to enter. If I get inside, \ufb01Gestapo,\ufb02 I said in my mind, \ufb01might be in.\ufb02 I don\u2122t ask anybody. I didn\u2122t talk to anybody. I go to the door and open it, and I\u2122m inside. In front of me a big 49 beautiful desk and a man sitti ng there, I am God Almighty. I assume right off this is the consul. Next to him, Gestapo, and guns, a nd you name it. And he looked at me, didn\u2122t address me, either. Who was I? You needed permission. You need an invitation. You just didn\u2122t walk in that way. And he said to me , \ufb01Well, what would you like? Who are you?\ufb02 And I start talking quickly, I said, \ufb01I have to have \u0152 I have to go back. I have to get an American visa in order to go\ufb02, and I stop talking. He starts screaming, \ufb01You\u2122re Jewish! You\u2122re Jewish!\ufb02 \ufb01Yes, I am Jewish.\ufb02 \ufb01You dare. You dare to co me here. How did you get in?\ufb02 I started to say something. \ufb01Get out of here right away.\ufb02 And I tell him what I want. He said, \ufb01No Christian, no Jew, nobody is allowed to get in.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Go!\ufb02 And I looked at him, and he\u2122s furious at all the people who work there. I said, \ufb01I\u2122m not going.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01You\u2122re not? We are in Germany,\ufb02 he said, \ufb01You will go to the concentrati on camp. You will \u0152 looking at you, how you look, you won\u2122t survive it. You won\u2122t survive it.\ufb02 He said to me, \ufb01Go!\ufb02 Then, something in his voice got soft, and he said to me, \ufb01Go, go, please go. Nothing will happen to you here. I will see that you get out, get you again on Swiss territory, but please go.\ufb02 He looked at me. \ufb01I\u2122m not going.\ufb02 He repeated this two or three time s. Then, so far, he says, \ufb01I wouldn\u2122t want anything should happen to you. Go!\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01I won\u2122t go because if I go, I will never see my fianc\u00e9, and th at\u2122s the end.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01I cannot give it to you.\ufb02 And, he started again, \ufb01Go,\ufb02 and then he shows to the men, he said, \ufb01Take her and lead her out.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I\u2122m not going to walk.\ufb02 He looked at me with a pierced look. His eyes were lethal, but he said, \ufb01Lift her up.\ufb02 There was not much to lift. \ufb01Lift her up and carrying her out, and out the door.\ufb02 Two men, one on the right, the other on the left hand \u0152 they carried me to the door. He carried me to the door, and a little out al ready. Suddenly, you hear a voice, \ufb01Stop! Put her down. Come here!\ufb02 he calls me. I go in. He tells all the Gestapo, \ufb01Everybody go out!\ufb02 He 50 was only with me alone. And he said, \ufb01You know , I really would like you to go.\ufb02 Nicely, in nice way. \ufb01I would not want anything should happen.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01I can\u2122t go.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01You seem like _____ nothing anymore.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Talk to me.\ufb02 I talked. He said \u0152 he takes a pen, and he says, \ufb01Give me your pass port.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01I do not know why I\u2122m doing this.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Do you realize I can lose my position? And, I can lose more than that.\ufb02 He means that if he did it, something could ha ppen to him. \ufb01This is against the wish of the Furor, of Hitler.\ufb02 He takes the passport \u0152 I had the passport there \u0152 he takes it, writes in his name, and here\u2122s a number. I have a visa. I walk out. I couldn\u2122t believe it because I\u2122m sure never, ever before, and it probably never will happen. Why did you do it? Why did he\u2013? And I said miracles. Why did he it to me? Why did he endanger his whole life and his family? Why? And if this happened going to Ge rmany, my life was practically safe. It was \u0152 here it was the consul himself that he gave it to me. Now, I had to go back, you see, I was in Switzerland now with a visa. I didn\u2122t dare to tell to anybody. When the war with Poland was over, I get a ticket and I get on the train. I get on the train going back to Vienna, and the war was over with Poland. It didn\u2122t take long, you know. It took over \u0152 the war was over, and I traveled only with soldiers, German soldiers . They were ______ that I was Jewish. I had on me my passport, but I didn\u2122t open it, nobody sa id \u0152 but you can imagine for hours, I was scared silly, but they were nice to me. They did not know who I was. I come to the border Switzerland and Germany \u0152 Austria, and there you had to go through an examination above it because I was not German. She saw the passport. They examined me. I had to undress. It was a woman. And I had \u0152 I still have it, I ha ve to show you. When you got married you had nothing yet. My husband gave me a little golden chain with a little heart. It was worth nothing, but I had it hidden anyway in a little pocket on the side. I\u2122m afraid it falls to pieces, 51 and she looks at me. She says, \ufb01Why didn\u2122t you le ave it in Switzerland?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01I couldn\u2122t leave it. My husband said it would bring me lu ck.\ufb02 And she looked at it, and she started discussing it with two or three other men, and then I was alre ady dressed. A man comes to me and says, \ufb01Look, you will hope be able to take the little heart and neck- (ph) out when you come here. I\u2122m going to write it in your pa ssport.\ufb02 You see my pa ssport with a little heart and necklace taken in. He wr ote it in, and there it was. So, I keep on going. I arrived in Vienna in the evening. Eddie picks me up. We we re not allowed to take a taxi or anything, and he said to me your number might have b een gone by now. It took me just two days, three days. They might have given me to somebody else. And, did I talk too fast? No. And, he said \u0152 the next day we rushed to the American Consulate. Yes, my number was still there. They hadn\u2122t given it away yet. They gave me they nu mber. They gave me my visa. I was the last one after the people had to wait for a long. I was the last one. You do not know such circumstances at the moment what they\u2122ll be. E ddie rushes me to the train again, off go back to Switzerland. He still stays. He didn\u2122t have his numbers yet that he c ould also cross. Rush me all off to Switzerland, and I \u0152 no, I take a train to Switzerland, and we come \u0152 it\u2122s, of course, a German train \u0152 we come to the borde r. The train stops. The conductor says, \ufb01This train is not going any further, and there is no other train today or tomorrow that goes to Switzerland.\ufb02 You can imagine. What now? What now? I\u2122m in German grounds. My time has elapsed. I have to be out.
