We had to share these bunkers with the SS. But again, they left us alone. They were humans, human beings. They left us alone. There wa s one bunker next to ours; there was only SS.

            "answer": "Well, then Berlin got too hot. The Siemens complex was destroyed. Our work camp was destroyed and they ferried us up to Oranienburg concentration camp, back to the concentration camp. That was al ready the later days of the Nazi era. Most people saw the light; that this was an untenable situation and the Germans were done for. Was only a matter of time. They prepared us -- again no hardships. They prepared us for a march to Meklenburg, to the Meklenburg region and we were supposed to board a Red Cross ship in Bremen but we had to walk over there. The order came to march us into a forest and to machine-gun us all to death."

            "answer": "They were afraid it was that point retalia tion. They said to hell with these orders. We just march on. Let\u2122s go. So we go. We we nt to that one forested area, full of foxholes, for the night. Bedded ourselves down in one of the foxholes. We had our -- at that time our hair was starting to grow and we had our -- we took our blankets along and all that. We were pret ty well organized there. In the morning, we looked around, no SS. No German officer s. There was a clearing. In a far clearing, I saw a rider, man on horseback. Turned out to be a Russian soldier on reconnaissance. They discovered us and took us in to a gigantic farmhouse with a barnyard and what-not. The Russian colonel who turned out to be a medical doctor, spoke a good German at that time, he said, look, you\u2122re free. But if you want to do yourself a favor, don\u2122t eat right away anything that comes into sight. I know you are hungry. We will give you some thin soup and we\u2122ll gradually increase your diet to where your stomachs can digest it, because if you eat, you die. That\u2122s what the colonel said. He said you get sick and you\u2122ll die. We were a couple of days with the Russians. They fe d us pretty well. They gave us no solid food for the first two days and then they started out with a slice of bread here, a little ____ there and so on. But somehow I reacted, I came down with dysentery. Then the Russian said, we have no ill facilities. I\u2122ll tell you what, we\u2122ll deliver you to the British. They have a field la b, a field infirmary and they can get you back, straightened out. They put me on a -- what the Russians call an ambulance, and got me over to the British lines which weren\u2122t far away. There, I spent about three weeks on a diet of all horsemeat hambur gers. I gained weight at the rate of three pounds a day. I was simply emaciated."

I think it was the Ritz, I don\u2122t know. We were given clothes and thi ngs to wear, my first haircut. After this died down, went back to Nice and I reclaimed my old apartment. The books were gone, of course. I lived there for a year before I came down with the -- the diagnosis was water on the lungs. I went to the hospital and they found that I had water, I don\u2122t know. They took one of those gigantic syringes, those horse syringes, big needle, heavy gauge needle. The doctor felt me between the ribs and just jabbed that thing into the lung s and pulled out water. Pulled the water out of my lungs. Thank God the water was clear so there was no evidence of tuberculosis. They put me in a ward together with tubercular patients. So in order to prevent me from catching tubercul osis, they inject me with an aspirin solution. A sugar solution of aspirin, 500 milligrams a day, three times a day. They reduced it to 200, twice a day and then I came out of it, no evidence of tuberculosis. Well, here I am."

NOTE: After interview was concluded and recording equipment removed, Mr. Munzer recalled that he had not given correct information concerning the concentration camps. After Auschwitz, he was sent to Buchenwald, not to Dachau as stated. Review of transcript necessitated further minor changes from the taped interview."
