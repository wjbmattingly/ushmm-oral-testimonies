He print tickets to the movie, a small newspaper, a weekly newspaper, something like this. And we were very well off. My father look German. He was very blond, he no have hair. He was heavyset man, and he speak perfect German. So this help us from the beginning. You know, so no one Jew on the street, only father was, and he went to the stores where he make business, and was still making business after -- almost wh en the Ghetto start. Q. Would you say that your life befo re the war, you had a nice life? A. Right. Very nice life. Every year when the school fi nish, we went to villages. My father rent a small cottage. And the owner of th e cottage went to sleep with th e cow, exactly, so he can make a little bit money. And we be livin g in his house for two and a half months. There was the summer vacation. So I was very, very happy. The fact is -- maybe unbe lievable -- I was 12 when the war start. And we have a b eautiful river, and I was swimming in the river with the girls. I don't know whether I can say this. I found \u0152 I don't know what this was -- a rubb er. Rubber? I don't 2 know that it was condom. I don't know. I was sw imming in the water.

Lest, you see, I wa s raised in a home not religious , not a religious home but very nationalistic. In other words, my father was belonged to organizatio n for Israel. Besi de this we eat everything. We go with Christ ian people any places. There was ab solutely difference, but I have fear in home, in out side home, friends. Q. When did you start feeling that things were changing? A. Changing? A months or two b ecause Poland had a beautiful jungle on east side, and the bigshots from Germany come every year to kill animal in the jungle, you know. Th e last summer -- the last summer they didn't come, and they don't know not in the newspaper, nothing mentioned. This was the first things. After this , Hitler starts sending Jewish people wh at been born in Poland and went to 3 Germany for jobs -- this is before the war, everything -- and there was many, many Jewish people that come to Germany to work. Mostly from Poland. And they was from Belgium and France and from different country. And this times, they didn't come. This is the second things. Lot of people start talking and people start buying food, do everything what people doing, have a feeling something will be happen, something. Okay. One night -- I never forget this -- we hear, (indicating footsteps) on the street, so loud. And there was German. First ti mes I saw German soldier on the street of Lodz, unbelievable. Poland, af ter six weeks fighting with Germany, run away. Everybody run away to different country and left the 30 milli on people by himself. Q. What year was this did you say? A. That was 1939. Q. After, okay. A. Yeah. Mine first things, wh at happened to me from a German soldier, I was walking up the street -- we don't the, you know, the star. They come later. I wa lking on the street and going very fast by the wall, and I hear somebody walk in the back. I supposed to run right away from him and out of sight, and let the person go before me. And I no done th is. I was a child. He start beating me. This is the first times because I supposed to give him the honor of the first walking on the street. I supposed to go in the ba ck. this was first things . After this I want Ge stapo, who ask couple girls -- and if you got ever gr eat, beautiful houses , all German move, German soldiers, and they go ask and say to clean up, wash the top of everything, and they give us a loaf of bread. And we was happy they give us bread. Q. You were cleaning the German houses? A. Yeah. I mean they was Po lish houses, but they move. Q. Now, at this point yo u were a teenager, yes? 4 A. Yes. I wanted mentio n because something -- I was a teenager, but I have a boyfriends. He was older for me, and he had been in the same gymnasiu m, enough that this he decide to learn how to build radios. It was not television this times, only radio and all electrician jobs. He love electrician things. So he went to special school and certain time, three hours, he come to gymnasium, so he has two schools. And he live not far away from me. And we been ch ildren together. We even not kiss each other. There was difference. Q. You didn't or di d kiss each other? A. No. I'd like to tell you about mine sisters and brothers. Can I? Q. Sure. A. I have older sister, and she wa s 15 years old when the war start. And he asked -- and she had a boyfriends -- and she asked my father, now she wants to marry him. Really my fa ther wanted him to marry because he know what's going on. Let's have somebody will take care of you. So she marry him. And he was from Belg ium, a Yish, and he -- his father was aristocrat. Our family, he no like us because we been not enough aristocrat, you know. He come from Russia, from Russia, not from the Communist. He run aw ay from the Communist, and he come to live in Lodz. And he so fall in love with my sister , and there was marriage. The marri age was in a basement. And my father begged the Rabbi, he no want to come beca use he was scared that they would kill him on the street. But he saw what was goin g on, he walked with my father to the other house, and he marry both, each other, he pray,and after this we sat all night and wait, the lights coming and went to his house. But he live with his mother . Life was terrible from the beginning even before the Ghetto start. You give everything what you have up for a loaf of bread or for soup or something because the diamonds in the rings an d this is nothing. It's not for nothing. How long you hung in. I never 5 believe in my life what hunger can do. I eat a dog. And some people in concentration camp eat a human. Can you believe this? I read a book about what happen ed in Venezuela or something. There were plane crash with 18 young people and six survive, rest died, and they been in the mountain food is none. You not remember this story? Q. I don't think so, but I think I know what you' re going to tell us. A. Right. And they eat the dead people. Q. Let's talk sort of ta lk a little bit more about the period before the Ghetto, okay? Were you aware, before the war, what was going on in Germany? A. Very little. Very little. Q. Once you were occupied by the Germans, th e people that you were friendly with before, the non-Jewish people -- A. Right. Q. -- were they still your friends after the Germans came in? A. Some. Some. I want to say something. Th e villages know what's going on. There was already Poland fall down so far. When a Jewish family went to the villages, and they, I give you money hiding us, people hiding. How long you give them mo ney, they tried to hide. After this, they no hide any of you, and then you must go. There was some villages went to the German, Polish people and they would say, listen, here and here is a hiding family or a sing le. German give, of course, to kill the Jewish people from the religious, and th e people what was hiding, they receive, the German decide to kill them because they're not supposed to hiding Jewish family. So there was danger both sides, you see. My friends, the be st friends, she survive because the family, the villages, hiding her. You know when you bake bread you got shovel, you know, in th e old-fashioned, after they 6 baked the bread, she went to the oven to hiding. And hours and hours in this very hot oven she laid down, and she hear when the German ask in the villages. She survive. Q. After the German s came in, did your family do things differently ? Can you tell me a little bit about the occupation? A. We seldom went out from th e house. Every noise make us ju mp and scare. They come from house in the house and they take people. We no have no place to hiding. Gentile people not hiding us because they're scared, too. Very simple. Because easy they can move, a nd we cannot move. It is the hunger, the hunger, the hunger. You no have nothing to eat. What will you eat a chair or a sofa? You cannot eat this. In a way, when they start the Ghetto, some people was not it would be different. They concentrate us, they mu st give us something to eat. The Ghetto in Lodz was 250 million Je wish people, but of this ha lf million people, half was Je wish. But they took the Jewish people, what been in all of Lodz, concentrate in Ghetto in one maybe 20 of the 25 streets is all. In one room, 11 people were in a room. Q. Did your family share space with another family? A. Yes. Q. What happened to your fath er's business in all of this? A. German took away -- I forgot to tell you -- when they come to Lodz, they have already a list who bought machines from Germ any. So the first things what theydone, they to ok my father machines. What he even not finished paying th e German. And that 's what happened. Q. Then were you still in school? A. School? No more schoo l. In Ghetto starts school ina room, in a street the teacher take a few children and start teaching. Everything was unbelievable. 7 Q. But before the Ghetto, basically all of the things that you normally did changed? You couldn't do them anymore? A. No. Absolutely not. I never saw my friends, Gentile friends, because they been scared, too. Q. So your social life ended? A. Oh, complete. Q. And the only other question I want to ask before we talk about the Ghetto a little more is, you said your parents were very invo lved with the Zionist Movement? A. Right. Q. How did that happen? How did they get involved with that? How active were they? A. Because the anti-Semitis m existed in Poland. Polish people ar e different from American people. I mean if you tell something Poland, he believ e you right away. Somethin g bad about what the Jewish people don't, you know, or you hear the story somebody sa y before the war even. Jewish people kill a Gentile girl and with her blood, they make matzo. You understand what I mean? This is enough to be a problem. There was enough because there are one-way truck. This is Polish people. Even today. Q. Do you have any other me mories of when the Germans came, how they treated you? A. They treat us very, very bad. Even when they catch you, you know, some Jewish people are very religious and follow exactly the Bible, and some people grow bear d. I not mean a beard now, beard, and have a special black coat. Wh en German saw something like th at, they catch him right away. They don't do nothing to him. And they took many, ma ny people to see a show from the street. And they took scissor and start cutting his beard, and the beard was very important for this specific sect of people, beca use they are very nice people. Th ey do nothing to nobody. And it hurts so much when you see, even if it was a li ttle girl what I was. I do anything to finish the 8 picture, and then they're laughing. After this they kill him in the eyefor young people. A little bit of another a street we hear this boom, boom. It wa s -- this is for pleasure. Q. Did they try to do anything abusive to you because you were a girl, because you we re a teenage girl? A. You mean because I was -- no . Sexual, you mean? No. No. Q. Because what I'm trying to understand, durin g all of these times was it different being a girl than a boy, I wonder? A. If it come to ph ysical, I don't think so. Be cause there was not enough to touch, my God, to touch a Jewish girl, or even Gentile, even Gentile. No. Q. Okay. So the Ghetto was formed. A. Yes. Q. Tell me a little bit about your life in the Ghetto, how it was? A. Ghetto. Okay. I was sleeping with, in one room, we are seven or eight people. Off the floor, of course. And my parents been sleeping in another houses, there was a fa mily, my father's cousin. So they try to go to this family mayb e we be better, and it was not. And we be lay down off the floor and no sheets, no nothing. And afte r this we were working in Ghet to. The German bring us to do job. And he ask who is, who ca n make uniform? Who can make anything? And everybody say, I can do it. They no have idea how to do it, but th ey wanted to have a little better piece of bread or something like that. My job was standing the lines, in the line. Why, I be en took from the line when I waiting for bread or for something like that. They take me from the line. I never saw nobody from my family till this day. Q. Before we get do that, I want to hear a little bit more about the Ghetto. How did you find a place to live there? How did this all come about? 9 A. The German give to the Gove rnment from Ghetto, let's see, they have something, we are government so, so much brea d and so, so much things. This is a ll what we have. Not soap to wash the face, not toothbrush, nothing. So me people bought to Ghetto with them, and they say to another person, you say, you give me pi ece of bread and I give you Co lgate or something, something like that. There was mi nimal what you can liv e human, unbelievable. Q. Did you take things w ith you into the Ghetto? A. Yes. I help my parents to carry. We have some money. We no have diamonds or ring, no. This, we no have it. Anyway, an d they took it anyway in the con centration camp. And they bring my sister help, my brother looking for something to steal. I steal coal, coal. You know, what they make hot coal you say. I steal every night, and there was ve ry cold. And you know, when somebody catch me, I will be shot right away. And this all time in Ghet to is to cheat somebody or steal from somebody because this life, you do this for your life. And ever y day we would come back to mother, and we show what we stolen, what we done. Q. You were stealing from other Je wish families? A. Right. Q. And at the time -- A. The morale went down, down. Q. And at the time you just didn 't have second thoughts about it? A. No. The fact is when there wa s -- and this was later - they took people fro m the Ghetto, start -- there was -- we have a police. We have fire engine from Jewi sh, from the Ghetto. So my girlfriends, she have a husband and a little girl, he come to her \u0152 I remember so vivid now when he tell her, listen, tomorrow come the Gestapo and they take people, all children. Give the children because if not, they will be killed if he come. Sh e say, no. He beg her. We young, maybe we will 10 be have more children, a nd they give this baby aw ay. And they come really -- and they come to her and drag the baby from her arms, and she jump from top fl oor together with the baby. He survived. He is in Israel now. Q. The baby? A. No, the husband Q.

If th ey are not found her, we must stay hours and hours and hours in rain an d shine before th ey found her hanging on the wires. Q.

I screaming unbelievable because I know that some thing happen to me. A nd we stay maybe two, three hours. It was a long train many, many wagons. Auschwitz is not far from Lo dz. Maybe one hour, that's it. But there is -- they put together so many wagons, so many th ings that go very, very 18 slowly. There was 40 people in one. And we been maybe riding five, si x hours. So slow we went to Auschwitz. Q. Did they tell you wh ere you were going? A. No. Q. You were all alone? A. Alone Q. Did you know any people in the car? A. No. Children, newborn.

One on anot her and screaming. The window was so small. And the wagons, shhhshhhshhh, slowly it went. And another story was when we come to Auschwitz, they open the door. Raus -- this is a German name to get out \u0152 raus screaming, Germans screaming. I think so they enjoy this screaming. They enjoy, and they beat the people what we nt up and cannot go faster, what you can. And they stay the whole line, the wag ons here and the people, here. After this what happened, you know, they must take the clothes, left to right, left line, right line. Q. Were the people in your transport men an d women? Was it mostly women and children? A. No. There was mixtur e. There was mixture. Q. Did women and childre n get deported earlier than men or everybody? A. No, everybody, maybe another tran sport. Maybe. I don't know. This is what I know. Women and small children all went in one way on the left si de, all, and then a young mother. And after this, women, single women and men in age 20, 21, 22, went left. 19 Q. Went right? A. Right. Q. And you were wi th this group? A. Yeah. Q. Now, at this point, did you know where you were or why? A. Everybody have a deep feeling because we saw, from far away, the priso n. You see, the German done it this way. They send to the gas chamber people and ta ke some people who would look healthy to work three months or fo ur months in Auschwitz. After this, after thre e, four months, they took them back, the peop le, to the gas chamber and put here new people, this way. So looks like healthy people working. And wh en Red Cross come to the Auschw itz, everything was peachy and beautiful, flowers. You no see the gas chamber. You no see the ovens. It was all decorated. Q. The Red Cross came in A. Uh-huh.

And not come to your mi nd, maybe three minutes later, you will be dead. Q. They said this to you? A. I was so scared, unbelievable scared. Maybe I see mo re women be somebody so I seen this, I feel I cannot explain you the -- the scared. I know I was scared. Enough this the clothes. You take the clothes off. And when I went to the right side, naked, they th row -- the Gestapo throw clothes to 21 people who were to get off the le ft side and throw one shoes small, one pieces clothes, nothing you can wear. Q. So after you got in this lin e, where did they take you? A. They take us deep in the showers, the barracks, and deep in the show us where to, official, where to wash. They never give us wate r.

So they didn't put you through any treatment right away? I mean, they didn't shave you, you didn't have to go through all of that horrible stuff? A. No. Q. So I'll let you continue. A. So next day, we have a girl, a prisoner, and she's -- you see, the Gestapo say, why I make -- he say to himself, but we understand -- why I beat the women if the prisoner can? And he say to her to get the best one from the barrack, I give you a piec e of bread, large, take over. And she was worse than the Gestapo because she want ed to show off how sh e work. She was hanging after six, seven days. The prisoners hang her. Oh, many, many was hanging. Q. She was hanged by the other prisoners? A. Right. 22 Q. Was this in your block? A. Yeah. Q.

If you eat the bread in one times, you finish. Q. What do you mean? A. You died from hu nger because it's not divided. You must divide the bread of three portions. And who have the strong willing to do this, and you so hungry. When a pris oner died in the bunk, everybody jump to looking for the piece of bread, because she have the bread, she cannot eat on it because she so sick. They fight for the piece of bread. Q.

We cannot, one second even, nothing because horse, the Gestapo went with a hor se. We walk, and he was riding of a horse and who show only feeling tir ed, he beat him, beat him. And he still cannot walk, shot him. Q. Why were you carrying - were you building some thing with these bricks? A. No. This is same thing, bricks, we went next day back to the same place, and we start. Same thing, bricks. Q. So what were you doing with them? A. Nothing. Carry bricks. And looking, looking up at the sky at airplane not coming, not coming. We don't hear a peep. We don' t know what day. We don't know what mont h. We don't know how the war. Everybody, America, why not come? I never forget. I was liberated by the Russian, and I been in a hospital, in Russian hospital. You kn ow, over with the war, th ey build right away a hospital. Field hospital, how you say? I was so near death. The Russian been very good 25 to me. I mean the first few days, you know. Unbeli evable. I went back to Poland, did I tell you? Q. Can I go back to the camp a minute firs t? I want to hear the whole story. A. What you want to hear? Q. When you were in the camp -- A. Yes. Q. -- tell me a little bit about the block that you were in. Wh o was in it? Did you develop friendships? A. Friendship. Q. Any of that sort of thing. A. Yes. There was two or three from Lodz. I don't know them from Lodz. I know them in camp. And we like each other. We help each other. Something human is still in our, so we help. I help two girls very much because we have diarrhea. You hear of the diarrhea? You have diarrhea, and they not run, the toilets. I cannot describe how toilet look in camp. This is two wooden in one this way. And the middle is a hole, and you standin g, and you do your thing wh at you need to do. Many fall down. Very simple because the hole was so big, and it's dark. You cannot see. So I friendship with two girls. One di ed in camp, and one I think is still alive. I mean, she sa y -- I hear that she is now in Australia, but I don't no whether this is true. And we been all three together. We help each other. Q. In what other ways di d you help each other? A. When we see or hear the Gest apo coming, I share with them right away. There was a girl, what she walk in -- I describe you. She have a job to go Canada. Maybe you hear about Canada? I don't mean the country Canada, I mean the job. You want to hear? Q. Yeah. 26 A. When the people took the clothes, you know ever ybody hiding something in here, in a sleeve a diamond, a ring in case. The jo b, there was six, he took six girl s, is every piece, you know, the clothes was looking for di amond. And when they found somethin g, he put in a place. Nobody steal nothing. Even if see beautiful ring, maybe you you ng, you take it. Nob ody. Why? Because we know why we will all died. Why we need the diamonds? Nobody. And she work in the Canada, Mrs. Ford, and I meet her. And she bring me sometime in her pant s, in the long pants she have bread, a piece of bread, you know, because she have th e opportunity to do to help us. And this was wonderful. And so were th e diamonds what we found. Q. Did you work in the Canada? A. No. Q. Your friend did? A. My friends. I was not so lucky. Q. So this was a privileged group? A. Right, but only three mont hs. That's all. This is not steady work. Afte r three months, they went to gas chamber. Q. Or maybe to another job? A. No. They took another six girls. This way they work. Same thi ng the men. There was men, about 12. Muscle, very strong men. What did they do? The gas chamber, when ab out 30 people, they closed the door. From one side they went, from another side they open the door. They was dead. So this eight men take the dead people by the barrow, you know, by this, you are hanging the legs here, here the head, here the legs, and they we nt not far away to the ovens. Okay. Because why the Germans changed people? B ecause they not wanted somebody as a witness, something can 27 happen if they come out from the ca mp. This is the reason. So when they shut up the six girls went to the oven, they took from camp another six girls. Q. But they came back and they slept in your block at night? A. Yes. Q. And that's how you know about this? A. Right. Right. Q. And you think afte rwards then they went to the ovens? A. Right, they kn ows. They cannot help beca use there is no place to run. Not everybody is suicide. So then they want to die by runn ing to the wires. They knows. Q. So the people in this Canada Commando were privileged. Were the ot her prisoners envious of them? A. Envious because he no thinks about it. You th ink about your stomach. Q. No one thought the job was particularly weird? A. No. Q. Were you aware of kind of the whole organization of the ca mp? Did you know where things were happening in other places in the camp? A. Yes. Yes. You know, men was not far away from us. And sometime they come to the camp to the women. Sometime they sleep with the women. Q. How is this? A. How? The Nazi no look. They drunk. Q. Once they're alr eady in the camp? A. Yes. Q. So there was sex in the camp? 28 A. In the camp. You never hear about it? Q. No. A. Yes. There was sex in it. It's not much an d not many. Especially th ere was husband and wife separate. Q. But weren't people, weren't men and wo men kept very separately in the camp? A. You mean -- Q. The men were kept very separately? A. Right. I don't know no thing about the men, the life in camp. I don't know. Q. But then how did the me n and women co me together? A. How? Is many ways. They make a hole in the wires, under the wi re. And so many people, thousands and thousands and thousands, they can go away with something like that, or they bring the women more bread. The wives, many wives and husba nds. And it was dark. Something happened. You know, German is drinking, drinking, and drinking, beer, al cohol, or whatever because the life of the Ge stapo was not very easy. Some -- I don't know if you hear this story. I think so, I tell you on the telephone. The Gestapo hid the women in th e bushes. Did I tell you this? No? And we stand in th e line was a beautiful girl. I can no describe you, a Hungarian, and the Gestapo standing with her, and the lines start close up. So he push, with the boot, he push her in the bushes. He save her life. This is what he done. There was very seldom a Gestapo have a heart for something like that. Maybe they suffer, too, because they see so mu ch blood and so much death. They wanted to go home. Q. Were they drunk a lot? A. Yeah. You know ther e was orchestra? You h ear about the orchestra. Q. Tell me about it. 29 A. The Gestapo found people what can play a music instrument. An d they organize an orchestra, orchestra, and very loud. So ther e was a movie about this. So this people would arrive, cannot hear the screaming and crying from th e people what went to gas chambe r, and the louder they play, the people cannot hear. There was a movie. Q. Playing For Time? A. Yes. This is true. Q. Did they also play just fo r your entertainment or not? A. For the German, yes. Q. For the Germans? A. Oh, yes. Q. Not for you? A. No. No. Q. Were the Germans more abus ive when they were drinking? A. Yes. Q. Can you describe it? A. They beat us from nowhere, fo r nothing. They beat us so much their ha nds no work any more. Q. What was an average day like? Can you describe it? A. It's four o'clock to five o'cloc k. The Gestapo or the capo raus get out, out, out. And shine, rain, no difference. We standing in a circle. Every ba rrack have a circle. We count. We must count one, two, three, four to the end of the list is all right. It's quiet. Go out. The people start going, running what they needed. And in another circle, if somebody missin g, this is the worst thing. You stay and stay straight hours. We found this person. Mostly she's suicide. They start from the wires. They take hour, two hours, it depe nd. After they found her, we start going ove r what we supposed 30 to do. They bring us the water, the coffee, the hot soup or someth ing, and there is only one thing good, is hot. We always freezing cold and cold an d cold. And we start. Somebody have not come, they give another girls. We very sociable in camp, you know, because we wants to share. Maybe that God forgive them because th ey share with another woman. An d after this, we start working, seven o'clock already. Many time s when we feel fine, we talks jo kes with each ot her, you know, and they comb the hair, and we have the times and after this co mes the soup and the piece of bread, famous bread. And this is. Q. This was your day? A. Yeah. Q. Now, did you have anothe r countdown in the evening? A. To carry the -- you mean -- Q. Another roll call in the evening? A. Yeah. Yeah. You mu st count everyone. German is very -- thinks everything must fit. Q. People say these were so horrible. W hy where they so horri ble, these roll calls? A. Because the dead, the dying look all in our face you can see you white, no color. I give you example. I am -- I no ha ve enough red blood. I am anemic. And this start from camp. And you see, when you no have to do something, you star t dreaming, you start fant asizing. You look into face. You see far away because you fantasize wh en you home. You see the parent, you start talking to each other. You start crying. So that was the good days, and there be bad days, too. I no have enemy. I was not -- because I have a feeling I will be survive. I don't know why. I have a feeling I maybe not die. Q. Were you ever sick in the camp? A. Yeah. I have typhus, not stomach typhus, big things 31 here. How do you call this, typhus? Q. Skin -- A. Skin typhus -- the temperature go to 140 -- 1 04, excuse me -- 104 and up. And I been between two girls. They hold me by the coat.

Some was Gentile, some was only Jewish. In mi ne there was mixture. There was Gypsy, what I te ll you, mostly catholic Q. Did you become fr iendly with them? A. Yeah. Death is the sa me for everybody. Some we re frightened, very scared. Some say this is what God give us, we must die. But we will be live. And we hope together. Q. Was there any differen ces that you noticed in the way people responded to what was going on? A. Yeah. It is difference. Some people hold anot her person, physically. Sh e cannot help her, but together. And you saw this in barrack. There no exists anti-Semitism anymor e. That's it. Q. Everyone was? A. Everybody. Q. Was there a lot of affe ction between the people? A. No. There was not. Q. Now, I heard that what happ ened to a lot of young women wh o went to the camps was their periods stopped. Is that true? A. Yes, me too, yes. I was lucky. We have pill. They give us a pill. I don't know whether this is only tale or whether this is true. They give us a pill in the soup what they give us. I don't know whether this is possible to stop it, or it stop because we no ha ve vitamins. We no have nothing. This is probably what make it stop. Q. How many years? A. I thinks I have three years. Yeah. Q. Did you find it alarming? A. I don't care. I was hap py. I don't need the rags. Q. Now, you had told me an interesting story about how you came in contac t with a Gypsy prisoner. 33 A. Yes. Q. Will you tell us that story? A. Yes. Near my barrack it was da rk already. They co me to me. I hear cr ying and crying, and I saw a girl and she tell me she's Gypsy and to help her I say, what I can help you? She say because I have diarrhea and everything is ar ound me. I no have rags. I no ha ve nothing to clean. I no have water to clean. And the Gestapo see me, they shot me on the spot. So I went to barracks, and I found rags and little bit water. I don't know, there was rain, and I help her to clean up. And I forgot about this. Maybe a week, maybe more, I stand in the same place, she come back and she thank me what I help her. And she say, I want to help you. And she tell me what will be. From Hungry or Romania, I don't remember exactly, come a transport and you barra ck, they come to your barracks. And you know thank her and I no went anymore to th is barrack. And I wait, I sit in the bushes not far away where I help cleanup her, and I wait. I don't know whet her I fall asleep, probably I fall asleep. When I wake up, I see strange people, strange language. They really took the whole barracks, I think 41 people, to th e gas chamber and substitute with th e Hungarian. I went inside and pretend I am one of them, and I stay in the barrack. She save my life. Q. You stayed with the Hungar ian people then for a while? A. Yes. Q. Could you ta lk to them? A. Yeah. They wanted to know what's going on here ? Why, when, a nd who? Where they went, people. You know, you have little bit intelligence, you will be not asked a question because the smell of burning flesh is so strong. Unbelievable . You can smell this mile and mile. Maybe they don't know this is human, prob ably not. So I be lieve from the beginning, and I changed. Q. Did you know what it was in the beginning? 34 A. No. After this. And you know, I've been so sick from this. When a transport, a new transport come from any country, everybody go to the wire to find out, maybe to look for some body from this country, what is ally. I went out from this. I cannot, because I know this w ill be dead so soon. This Hungarian and Romanian women are beautiful, and this beau tiful women, with the children, are going to die, maybe some wi ll live. And this barrack been standing for a while. Q. Were you ever aware of the gu ards or the police, either German or even the prisoner guards, taking advantage of all these beautiful women? A. I don't know. I know one things, they have a bo rdello. How you call this? Q. A bordello? A. A bordello. They took women from -- even Polish women -- to th is place. But they been right away, after they have -- how to say? After they rape the women, let's see, they died very soon after. Q. Did you know women who we re taken to this bordello? A. Yeah. Very pretty Hungarian girls. Very. Q. Jewish-Hungarian? A. No. They was Hungarian. They was Hungarian gi rls. Very, very nice. Th ey come so rich dress, with the luggage. And probably the Gestapo was good for them in Hungry so they can take everything, and they left everything. To this day th ey say -- I don't know how much is true -- on the bottom of the sea, on th e bottom of the river, they can find a huge, huge diamond and gold in a special container. What they took from Hungary. Q. And they would constantly been replenishing? They would be sending more and more women to this bordello or whatever? A. Yes. Yes. They start with Hungarian, they start. Q. Were you aware of any women who were pregnant in the camp? 35 A. No. They destroyed them right away. Q. Did you personally have any contact with men in the camp? A. Me? Oh, no. No. Q. How much freedom of movement was there when you say you went out to help that woman? Could you come to go? A. Yes. You have freedom afte r you come from work, after. But you was very careful because anything, anything that can start the fire. Q. Were you able to sleep pretty well? A. I think so. I have nothing, only boot and from rocks for a pillow. We put together slowly. The rocks dirty, filthy, but we use this. Q. And there were three, six people in your bed? A. Six people in bed. When some body died in the nighttimes, we ke ep her because she warm up us. In morning we call the ca po and say, she's dead. Q. Now, were you aware of any of the medical experi mentation we read about? A. Not me. I know it was do ne, and I know where it was done. And this is all. I never talk or saw somebody do this. Q. Is there anything else you wa nt to tell me about Bi rkenau that you can re member really, some unbelievable memories you have of camp there? A. This is not enough? It was nothing worse than I saw th is. No. I don't think so. Q. Now, what happened? I kn ow that you left Birkenau. How did that come about? A. How? Q. Yeah. 36 A. They come with the trucks, an d they took the whole barracks. And that's it. They don't say nothing. And we went to the train. We know why we not going to the train to di e because the train was in a different direction, and there was difference there, the oven s and the gas chamber. So we don't know exactly where we go ing and are we going. And it to ok us maybe a day. There was maybe 500 women, something like this. And we come to the place, it was beautiful place. It was in the mountain, and you no see the war in this place. And they find a place, and they built something, something you keep horses. Many, many cabins of the war, whatev er it is. And next day they took us to place where it was factory. Factory. Huge place. You no see the end. And this where I, we start working. There was terrible. We no have gas chamber. We don't have crematory, but the train, every day, day after day after da y collected the dead or the dying people to Auschwitz. And they show me what to do and, you know, when you wanted to sharp a knife, right? You have the guns in the hand, and here is a mach ine. And you must watch not too fa st, slowly. If not, they beat you. Terrible thing. And this was my job. And this was unbelievable. I don't think so I will be survive one day. And how I learn to breathe. You must breathe in th is way. (Demonstrates breathing technique.) And after this, you take big, deep breaths, breathe, and start again. This was 12 hours a day. And when the Gesta po no look me, we took deep breaths, breaths and start, pretend we work, we not working. And many die. It's unbelievable how many girls died from this dust from the guns. Unbelieva ble. Every times they bring us new guns, new different things, you must catch everything fast, if not, they beat you. Q. So you were making guns for the Germans? A. Right. Q. It must have been a strange feeling. Where was this factory, a nd what year do you think this was? 37 A. The factory was off bo rder of Germany and Austria . Ones ti me they belong to the Germany, one times it belong to Aust ria, in the mountain. Q. What was the name? A. Halberstadt, Sudetenland. The town wa s Halberstadt, Sudete nland, the mountain. Q. And do you know the time period you were there? A. How long? Q. And what year it was, maybe? A. In May, 1940, when the war -- I forgot when the war stopped. Q. It stopped in 45. A. 45, right. May the 9th, right. And this -- I work two years. Two years. Q. So you were treated ve ry badly there as well? A. Yes. Plus this -- plus the what with the guns. The guns, it was terrible. I had to carry this stone. We work in the factory. Q. Why is that? A. Why? Because you cannot br eathe. And when you normal breathe, you died, not important. Why the transport go every day. We say good-bye to every girl. They know they're going to die in the oven. Young girls. Q. How do they know? How did y ou know where they were going? A. Because the Gestapo say to us. And we know the direction where they're going. Q. Now was the structure th e same here at this factory? I me an, you had a block leader and you had a capo? A. Yes, the same. Except they no have ovens, and they no have cremator y. This not. This why every day went to Auschwitz. 38 Q. But the situation, there was no food, you were crowded, you were -- A. Maybe our food maybe was a little better because there was not so many people as in Auschwitz. Q. Were there men at this factory also? A. Men? Q. At the factory? A. Yeah. Q. Did you have co ntact with them? A. No. Q. So, what happened next? A. Next? You look to the sky and pray. Now, maybe the American come. Maybe the England, the Russian. One day -- there was in ' 45 -- we know what is the end. We knows. I cannot explain. We don't have magazines. We no have nothing. We have a feeling because we see the German pack the big guns. We see difference ev ery day so maybe this is the end. Q. How were the Germans acting? A. Acting scared. The Ge rman acted scared. Not fo rget now, the German sold ier still have a family and children and this. Because the German say, we \u0152 the top tell us what to do. We not kill the people, they tell us to kill. You see, they're not -- they're innocen t. And so we were -- we saw something going difference. And they come one day. We saw the Gest apo because from the barracks where we live to the factory, we walk maybe a mile. We say, the Ge stapo didn't come today. We don't know wh at to thinks. And we hear, we hear the bombs, the artillery, you know, the machines. So it is different. And we hear loud er and louder and louder. We don't know who, whether it the Germans or whether this is the American, or the Russian, we don't know. And one times we stay in the barracks and they open th e door and we saw the first Russian soldier. 39 Unbelievable. He hug us and ki ss us and do anything. You know how the Russian with American was friends forever. And they give you chocolat e. They give you everything. And we were very, very -- you never believe I was 70 pounds. I was so sk inny. I cannot walk, I cannot move. But I wanted to go back to Poland, mu st go back to Poland . Must find somebody. Come. I meet three girls, two really. Two gi rls, one from Hungary, one from Poland , and their age. They I wanted to go home to find out if so mebody. So we to ok and started walking because, you know, the war you no have cars, you no have nothing.
