His background was, from what he told me, is that at one point as a child he was sent away to -- I don\u2019t know if it was an orphanage or it was like a youth home for children. And he stayed there for awhile, and I think he was also schooled in that area. And then he returned. He also told me that his ancestors, or his father, which is actually my grandfather, his father came from Vienna. And in those days they made shidduchim, a shidduch, so he was matched up with my grandmother, who was from Poland, and apparently from Boryslaw. So that\u2019s how the famil -- th-the roots of the family came from Vienna into Poland into Boryslaw. And my father became a craftsman, but the word -- what\u2019s -- not a mechanic, but what is that called, the people who do fences from metal."

And he opened a little workshop for himself and he employed his younger brother and he also employed a young man in that workshop and that\u2019s what they did, they assembled bicycles and sold bicycles because it -- in those years, that was the mean of transportation, or you had a horse and a carriage, or you took the train. Not too many cars were yet in Poland. But what he told me that his dream was, before the war, to import cars into Poland and develop this -- this -- this whole idea of transportation. Well, unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out, World War 2 broke out and those dreams were shattered. The other thing also, which I can mention it, he told me that he also was drafted into the Polish army and he served in the Polish army as a soldier."

Now, after the war, when the war ended, they maybe thought that nobody will survive, cause my mom died, grandma was taken into a concentration camp. They thought my father, who knows, he probably won\u2019t survive either. But he did, and so immediately after the war, a law came out in Poland that if there is a parent and there is a child that survived, they have to be united. So that\u2019s what happened.

He is the rightful father and, you know. And that\u2019s it.

And my father started with his business in wa -- in -- in Lignice and things were going well for him and he made good money and so forth. And he received a package from my cousin -- his -- his -- his cousin, which was my second cousin, a package of clothing and he opened it up and he said, oh my God, what a collection of some shmatas. What is he sending me, some shmatas? This is America, he says. This is -- this is what life is in America? That\u2019s what -- I mean, here I have decent clothes, I -- I mean, it\u2019s a different life that I live than -- this is th -- you know, that was his impression for some reason. And Jake Schutzman instead, sent him a letter and sent him papers to fill out at that time and deposit it in the American embassy. He did that, but much later. I don\u2019t know, some years went by, maybe three, four years went by by the time you went and deposited those papers in the American embassy. And -- and then he couldn\u2019t, in \u00b051, immigrate to United States because Poland -- Poland had a quota of so many people America would accept from Poland. And then you had to have a sponsor. So sponsor was Jake, but his financial situation at the beginning, in \u201951 wasn\u2019t great. He wasn\u2019t that long in United States in order to sponsor, and so the other option was only going to Israel."

In that tent there were -- we were there, another Romanian family from Romania, which we could not communicate and two other families from Yemen, which we could not communicate. The Yemenite Jews that came, they were dressed entirely different than those from Europe. And evening c-came, suppertime, they all sat on the floor and they put this big tray and they started eating with their hands. And my father and my step-mom, when they saw that, they got up and they went real close to look and they spoke to each other in Polish and they called me to see. Look, look, take a look, look how they eat. I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. You sit on the ground and you eat with your hands. Where am I, he said. I came to like nomad lands.

Another thing was, at the beginning when we moved into the -- Ma\u2019barah, you didn\u2019t have your private shower, so we all had to shower in a public shower that they built, you know, and they didn't make it compartmentalized separate. They made -- you know, they put those showers and everybody in, you know, and my father and my mother they just -- they couldn\u2019t. So this -- first thing my father did after he built that room was immediately to put up a shower so he doesn\u2019t have to go and shower. He was in that -- very handy. I must say he was very handy to put up a room to house his furniture, to build the fence, to build a chicken coop for the chickens. So, you know, make a little kitchen for my mom so she can cook and make a shower for us. Now, the bathroom had to be a public bathroom and so, you know, we used this public bathroom, which wasn\u2019t a bathroom like we are used to it, it was a hole. A huge hole in the ground and you know, there were like four compartments, but there was a wall that separated those four, so thank God for that. And I remember petrified going to the bathroom. Why? Because when I looked into the hole, I said oh my God, if I fall in there -- and I was small, you know, I wasn\u2019t a big kid or something. My God, if I fall into this hole. That was very, very scary. That was something that I remember til today, the fear of going to the bathroom, but you had to. You didn\u2019t have another facility. So we lived there two years and in the meantime they managed to buy an apartment, which was in the process of being built, and it took almost, I don\u2019t know, a year or so to finish it, so that\u2019s why we stayed there almost two years. And then we moved to Herzliya, to a place called no -- a -- Noht Sarah, the dwellings of Sarah. It was a 40 -- 40 unit apartment, a long one, a three story building."

Now, if you stop high school after two years, which is the 10\" grade and you transfer to a Seminare and you finish the two years of high school in the Seminare plus two years in the same Seminare tea -- becoming a teacher, then you are not -- your education is not interrupted and you don\u2019t go to the army. Now, but when you finish the Seminare and you are not married, you go to the army. So happened I met my husband in the last year of Seminare aki Butsim. And I\u2019ll never forget he said to me, okay -- I said, you know that at the end of the year I have to go to serve, to the army. He said [indecipherable] you\u2019ll serve in my army. And we got married and that --"

            "answer": "And my -- I -- at a wedding and it was a wedding of one of the builders that was marrying her son and my father was very insistent that I should go too to that wedding, and I didn't want to. Because you have to understand that in Israel when you are 18, you are very self sufficient. You don\u2019t go with your parents. And I said, I should go with you? And that makes sense. I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to go. He said no, you should come, you should see a builder, he is a very well-to-do man and a beautiful wedding and we\u2019re all invited and -- all right. So we wen -- I went to the wedding with them and I wasn\u2019t very happy because I had to sit with them and it was boring, and interesting. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to back up now. When we came to Israel in 1951 there was a family from Boryslaw that my father remembered. He was not 1n contact with this man, but he knew that he immigrated to Israel. His name was Joseph Holzman. He immigrated to Israel as a youngster when he was 17, before World War II. Left the family, his father, I think died at a -- at the front fighting, I think, I don\u2019t know if it was the Pole [phone ringing] This man, Joseph Holzman, who was born in Boryslaw and my father knew him from Boryslaw, but there was not really a contact between the two til my father arrived in Israel, and he said, I have to find this man, I want to see what he does here so maybe he can guide me what to do in Israel. And so this man Joseph Holzman, in Herzliya by the beach had a motel, a little motel and that was his business. And so I remember I was -- we just -- you know, we just arrived in Israel and we were living in the -- in that Sidney ali that I mentioned, which 1s close to where they lived and had their motel, so we went there one evening, and -- all of us, and you know, they spoke about whatever. And that\u2019s it. And maybe he gave my father some advice and we left and that\u2019s it. And there was never a contact any more. At the wedding his wife, Joseph\u2019s wife came to the wedding. He wasn\u2019t there because he stayed in the motel cause they had guests and he had to attend to the guests that they had. And -- but his wife was with her son at the wedding. And we were ready to leave the wedding and go back home, it was around 11 o\u2019clock and we had to catch the last bus from Tel Aviv, and so -- where the wedding took place. And Mrs. Holzman saw my father and she remembered him, she said, hello Mr. Weingarten, how nice to see you, blah, blah, blah, and I\u2019m standing in the back. And she asks, and this is your daughter? And my father said yes, and he introduced -- introduce yourself. So I introduced myself. She looked at me, grabbed me by the hand and she said, I have a very nice son, and I want you to meet him. And that was it, and the rest is history."

Many, many families I remember at that time changed their names to Hebrew names. And in fact, I went through that period too with my folks. I said, why don\u2019t you change from Weingarten, which 1s a vineyard, and change it to Karmi. Karmi is a [indecipherable] name of a vineyard. Why do we have to be called Weingarten? So that was a period that a lot of Israelis went through, and changed their names. And I think what happened also at that time, our Prime Minister Ben-Gurion, when he sent people overseas, diplomatic excursions or whatever, representing Israel, he wanted them to have Hebrew names and not names that were carried from the Diaspora or what have you, yes."

Things were forgotten, years went by, nobody thought about it. It was just erased. One day my father receives a letter from the American embassy. They are sum -- summoning him to come -- calling him to come to the American embassy. He went -- he didn\u2019t say anything to us -- he went to the American embassy to find out why are they inviting him. And -- completely slipped his mind, this whole episode what he did in Poland years ago. It was like 11 or 12 years ago. He came to the embassy and from what I understand, they told him, Mr. Weingarten, your Polish quota -- you deposited papers in this and this year, has finally matured. If you want, if you have a sponsor, you can go to United States within the next six months. My father came to us and he said listen, I got this letter and they said that I can now immigrate to America, but I\u2019m too old and I\u2019m not gonna start my life all over again. Your name 1s there, and Dahlia\u2019s name is there and Mama\u2019s name, anybody who wants to go -- you want to go, go. I don\u2019t know whether you can go, he says, but take this letter and go to the American embassy and see whether you have any rights at all. Well, a seed was planted in my mind. I said to my husband, you know what? Why don\u2019t we go and check out? Out of curiosity. We don\u2019t have to go, but let\u2019s go and see. Maybe we can go for a year, or two years, whatever it is, we don\u2019t have to sell anything. Why don\u2019t we just go and see? If it works, fine, if not, not. So I finally convinced him to go to -- to take the ride with me to Tel Aviv, to the consulate, because the embassy was -- was at the -- yeah, the embassy was in Tel Aviv, not in [indecipherable] in -- in -- in Tel Aviv, right. And we arrived there, a young couple and we -- I -- you know, with my broken English at the time, and he looked at us, the -- we -- we met with the consul. And the consul said, we -- he said, you are Anita Weingarten? Yes, I am Anita Weingarten. Well you -- you -- you have the right to go. You have the right like your father does, the same way. You are m -- but I -- you are married and you have a child, he said, we Americans do not separate families. I\u20191l never forget that sentence. We will add your husband and your child to your quota, and in five months you can go. Three months I think he said even, I don\u2019t -- you know. Well, providing that you have somebody who can sponsor you so you don\u2019t fall on the American government as a burden. So I came, I said, listen Dad -- he said well, we have a cousin in Washington, Jake Schutzman. Write to him and see how he responds to it. So I wrote him a letter, and he said, anything and everything that I can do for you, I will do. And we ended up in Washington."

May, June, July, we were three months in Washington and I just figured out I\u2019m going to cope, and I happened to land on a company named Dependo.

And vis-a-vis I constantly studied through courses from Baltimore Hebrew College and got a degree there. And continued working -- later when we moved -- we lived in Silver Spring. At first we lived in Washington, D.C. for two years and then we bought a town house in Silver Spring and we lived there for seven years. And after seven years we bought this house where we are in now, in Potomac. And I switched and I worked for Ha Shalom, vis-a-vis at the -- what is today Charles E. Smith\u2019s Jewish Day School. And I sent my daughter to that school. Prior to that it was called Solomon Schechter school and it was housed on East West highway at Ora Kodish and in Temple Shalom it was split and -- and I worked there for -- since \u201969 -- 1969 at Solomon Schechter and then it became Charles E.
