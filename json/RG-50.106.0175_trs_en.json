He came and -- and me -- remarried immediately after the war and came to claim me. From what he said, they didn\u2019t want to give me up, cause they already raised me and I was three and a half, and they ran away, he claimed with me, and they hid someplace. But eventually, you know, the police -- the Polish police, which was, I think, called Enkavide and the Russian police too, together came and they said you -- that\u2019s it, you must return the child. He is the USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0175 11 rightful father and, you know. And that\u2019s it. And I remember the journey on a truck, in the back of a truck, we were sitting on a truck and my father bought me this huge bear, which wasn't so huge, but it -- in my eyes it was huge and it made moo each time you turned it, and I was petrified. I was so scared of that bear. On the other hand I also got a doll, you know, and that\u2019s it. And then we rode on the track to a city called Lignice and we settled there for awhile. There were lots of Russians. I de -- remember, because we lived there already for almost a year, or maybe even a year and a half. So now I started having memories of that place.

I must say he was very handy to put up a room to house his furniture, to build the fence, to build a chicken coop for the chickens. So, you know, make a little kitchen for my mom so she can cook and make a shower for us. Now, the bathroom had to be a public bathroom and so, you know, we used this public bathroom, which wasn\u2019t a bathroom like we are used to it, it was a hole. A huge hole in the ground and you know, there were like four compartments, but there was a wall that separated those four, so thank God for that. And I remember petrified going to the bathroom. Why? Because when I looked into the hole, I said oh my God, if I fall in there -- and I was small, you know, I wasn\u2019t a big kid or something. My God, if I fall into this hole. That was very, very scary. That was something that I remember til today, the fear of going to the bathroom, but you had to. You didn\u2019t have another facility. So we lived there two years and in the meantime they managed to buy an apartment, USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0175 37 which was in the process of being built, and it took almost, I don\u2019t know, a year or so to finish it, so that\u2019s why we stayed there almost two years.

Because you have to understand that in Israel when you are 18, you are very self sufficient. You don\u2019t go with your parents. And I said, I should go with you? And that makes sense. I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to go. He said no, you should come, you should see a builder, he is a very well-to-do man and a beautiful wedding and we\u2019re all invited and -- all right. So we wen -- I went to the wedding with them and I wasn\u2019t very happy because I had to sit with them and it was boring, and interesting. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to back up now. When we came to Israel in 1951 there was a family from Boryslaw that my father remembered. He was not 1n contact with this man, but he knew that he immigrated to Israel. His name was Joseph Holzman. He immigrated to USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0175 44 Israel as a youngster when he was 17, before World War II. Left the family, his father, I think died at a -- at the front fighting, I think, I don\u2019t know if it was the Pole [phone ringing] This man, Joseph Holzman, who was born in Boryslaw and my father knew him from Boryslaw, but there was not really a contact between the two til my father arrived in Israel, and he said, I have to find this man, I want to see what he does here so maybe he can guide me what to do in Israel. And so this man Joseph Holzman, in Herzliya by the beach had a motel, a little motel and that was his business. And so I remember I was -- we just -- you know, we just arrived in Israel and we were living in the -- in that Sidney ali that I mentioned, which 1s close to where they lived and had their motel, so we went there one evening, and -- all of us, and you know, they spoke about whatever. And that\u2019s it. And maybe he gave my father some advice and we left and that\u2019s it. And there was never a contact any more. At the wedding his wife, Joseph\u2019s wife came to the wedding. He wasn\u2019t there because he stayed in the motel cause they had guests and he had to attend to the guests that they had. And -- but his wife was with her son at the wedding. And we were ready to leave the wedding and go back home, it was around 11 o\u2019clock and we had to catch the last bus from Tel Aviv, and so -- where the wedding took place. And Mrs. Holzman saw my father and she remembered him, she said, hello Mr. Weingarten, how nice to see you, blah, blah, blah, and I\u2019m standing in the back. And she asks, and this is your daughter? And my father said yes, and he introduced -- introduce yourself. So I introduced myself. She looked at me, grabbed me by the hand and she said, I have a very nice son, and I want you to meet him. And that was it, and the rest is history."

I said, why don\u2019t you change from Weingarten, which 1s a vineyard, and change it to Karmi. Karmi is a [indecipherable] name of a vineyard. Why do we have to be called Weingarten? So that was a period that a lot of Israelis went through, and changed their names.

They are sum -- summoning him to come -- calling him to come to the American embassy. He went -- he didn\u2019t say anything to us -- he went to the American embassy to find out why are they inviting him. And -- completely slipped his mind, this whole episode what he did in Poland years ago. It was like 11 or 12 years ago. He came to the embassy and USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0175 47 from what I understand, they told him, Mr. Weingarten, your Polish quota -- you deposited papers in this and this year, has finally matured. If you want, if you have a sponsor, you can go to United States within the next six months. My father came to us and he said listen, I got this letter and they said that I can now immigrate to America, but I\u2019m too old and I\u2019m not gonna start my life all over again. Your name 1s there, and Dahlia\u2019s name is there and Mama\u2019s name, anybody who wants to go -- you want to go, go. I don\u2019t know whether you can go, he says, but take this letter and go to the American embassy and see whether you have any rights at all. Well, a seed was planted in my mind. I said to my husband, you know what? Why don\u2019t we go and check out? Out of curiosity. We don\u2019t have to go, but let\u2019s go and see. Maybe we can go for a year, or two years, whatever it is, we don\u2019t have to sell anything. Why don\u2019t we just go and see? If it works, fine, if not, not. So I finally convinced him to go to -- to take the ride with me to Tel Aviv, to the consulate, because the embassy was -- was at the -- yeah, the embassy was in Tel Aviv, not in [indecipherable] in -- in -- in Tel Aviv, right. And we arrived there, a young couple and we -- I -- you know, with my broken English at the time, and he looked at us, the -- we -- we met with the consul.

You are m -- but I -- you are married and you have a child, he said, we Americans do not separate families. I\u20191l never forget that sentence. We will add your husband and your child to your quota, and in five months you can go. Three months I think he said even, I don\u2019t -- you know. Well, providing that you have somebody who can sponsor you so you don\u2019t fall on the American government as a burden. So I came, I said, listen Dad -- he said well, we have a cousin in Washington, Jake Schutzman. Write to him and see how he responds to it. So I USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0175 48 wrote him a letter, and he said, anything and everything that I can do for you, I will do. And we ended up in Washington."

But that\u2019s part of, you know, you -- you -- you acclimate yourself that way, that\u2019s part of life. And so then he worked for another gentleman, in fact the gentleman was a member of Beth El and I don\u2019t know what happened then, they fired him. And then I took the initiative into my own hands, opened the yellow pages, looked under heating and air conditioning and that was July, and we arrived in April. May, June, July, we were three months in Washington and I just figured out I\u2019m going to cope, and I happened to land on a company named Dependo. And I called up and Mr. Blom answered the USHMM Archives RG-50.106*0175 52 phone, and I said, we are from Israel, we are here three months and my husband worked in this line in Israel, in refrigeration and so forth. He said, okay, send him in. And he went and he got the job and he worked there for seven years. And after seven years he decided well, time to go on my own. And since then, with another partner and they opened their own business, and then, you know, sometimes partnerships does -- doesn\u2019t always work well, and after, I think, two years or so they separated and my husband went on his own. And sine then has been on his own and has his own company."
