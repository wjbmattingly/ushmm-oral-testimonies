It\u2122s really strange, because I know we\u2122re going to talk about the Hidden Children a little bit later, but the very first meeting I went to after our Hungarian group was formed, we sort of introduced each other, and everybody gave a little blurb of -- of the -- the war years, and I kind of ended up, not meaningly, sounding USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 4 like a Pollyanna, because everybody was telling not just horror stories, but of how terribly it affected them afterwards. Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and everything else on the Holocaust, and I\u2122ve -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but in many ways I have nice memories of ce rtainly the -- the pre-war years, and my memories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things, it was also a nurturing time. I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me, and protecting me. Of providing me with food when there wasn \u2122t any to be had. I was a very finicky eater, it was a pain in the ne ck, you know, providing me with -- with anything I would eat. And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend who was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time. So, I think because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing in retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of the post-war trauma that a lot of my friends , who are my contemporaries, still have."

It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the Holocaust theme takes place. And it was basically about a father protecting his child. I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 5 didn\u2122t think it was trivialized at all. I really related to it, because the whole process, in some ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept. So I never had their fear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the United States, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly flying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us. And to this day, you know, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing. And there was always a positive thing, that things would be okay. So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted to be sure that I wouldn\u2122t, and I guess I didn\u2122t. I don\u2122t know if that makes any sense."

That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to me in very strong language, because I think so mebody stopped us on the street, and asked us about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her, and disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended on it, and it\u2122s very important that I not questio n anything she says, and if she says it\u2122s one thing, it\u2122s -- if it\u2122s -- yes, that \u2122s absolutely -- that\u2122s the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that -- that was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up that way, so it wasn\u2122t quite as difficult for me to deal with.

A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about stealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don\u2122t remember all that well, but I don\u2122t think it was a major discussion, but she said that when you\u2122re hungry, sometim es -- it was there, she didn\u2122t think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever.

My father -- I think the reason for that during the war years, is that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I don\u2122t know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn\u2122t look obviously Jewish, I had blue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish. He had a no -- you know, a nose that was more obviously Jewish, and not only that , but what they were doing is -- had men just drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify. So, I think my father, during situations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone\u2122s house, or were stopped on the street, my father always stayed in the background. In -- You know, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 7 during -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my mother was very protective of his health. During -- Before the hiding, during the -- oi -- the bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the building, and we went down to the cellar, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to accomplish more, we stayed more in the background."

Every Sunday we went to the zoo, we went to the playground, we went to the amusement park, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the closet, or the wall of my room, and every even ing after he came home from the office, we would play a game of identif ying capitals. Countries all over the world, and eventually rivers, and oceans, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today. The fathers came home at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and getting you to bed, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with my father, and a -- a very loving relationship.

I mean, the very first thing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that was their food. You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly weren\u2122t poor. But we probably spent more money on the ope ra than we did on food, because food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in high school, whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in Jackson Heights, and every Sunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner. And we didn\u2122t. We had hot dogs, and beans, and I don\u2122t know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn\u2122t starve, but the quantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were. So, you know, I don\u2122t know what it would have been like. I thi nk I assimilated very qu ickly. We got here in the spring of \u212247, and I went to a very fancy girl\u2122s camp in Maine, that my daughter subsequently went to, that\u2122s still there, and if I had granddaughters, they\u2122d be going there. And then I went to public schools, I went to Hunter High School , and Hunter College. And I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends. I spoke English, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking English and Hungarian, kind of half and half. I started with one language and finished USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 11 with the other with my parents. I mean, they spoke English with an accent, but they certainly spoke it well enough. And I married an American, and I had absolutely no reason, so I definitely assimilated, and I think maybe if I had been more religious, I would have assimilated diffe rently, or not as easily."

It\u2122s interesting, my -- my son-in-law has an associate at his firm, and they adopted a Hungarian orphan, just recently, maybe four or five years ago. And they were a little older, they couldn\u2122t have USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 37 children, they gave up on adoption here.

And -- And my daughter mentioned to this woman about me, and would that be a good -- well, she thought that was a great idea, cause this child did not speak English, she was five year s old, and petrified.

And then we moved up here f -- in order for Lisa to go to PS six, which was a very good public school, and those were the rent control days, and got a rent controlled apartment, and I started looking around in schools, and I went -- I taught at a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 54 school on 108th and Madison Avenue.

And I was involved with Brandeis University National Women\u2122s Committee. And the National Women\u2122s USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 56 Committee was the sole supporter of the library, because it was a fairly new school, and they didn\u2122t have the alumni money coming in for a library, so the women, when the school was first formed, non-sectarian Jewish school, because education was very important, we supported the library. We had a very active chapter -- junior chapter in New York, young. There was an older -- our parent\u2122s genera tion, they formed a younger chapter, and I was very much involved with th at. And we did a lot of book reviews, and art classes, and I guess intellectually stimulating things, as opposed to a lot of other people were playing -- younger people, that had some free time were starting to play Mah Jongg, or Canasta, and all that kind of stuff, so this was -- we had a stock group, we were learning about that, so whatever was interesting, and I was always interested in that. We went to look at the Barnes collection. And there were a lot of artists popping up that were contemporary, unknown. Galleries that were appearing in Soho, that were new. Andy Warhol was becoming, O.K Harris Gallery was -- he used to give ladies art classes, before he opened the gallery. And they would donate stuff, and we would auction it off, or sell it, or whatever. And I was just really interested. Some of the galleries would give us cocktail parties, and fundraisers, and stuff, and that\u2122s how that Picasso lino cut back there, it was the first thing that I bought, that was an independent thing, and it was a lot of money at the time.

            "answer": "Yes, yeah. Somebody said that, it\u2122s like coming out of the closet. I think what happened, and I don\u2122t know how accurate this is, but I think the period of assimilation had passed. I assimilated, I grew up, I was an American teenager, I was married, you know. It is now at the point in time, where with my generation, it\u2122s all over, except these tapes. I didn\u2122t think about that 20 or 30 years ago. I wanted to go on with my life, and my parents wanted to go on with th eir lives. I mean, we were all very happy to be here, and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 61 still today, when people criticize this country, my European side comes out, and I always want to say, go away. If you don\u2122t like it here, go wherever it\u2122s better. Cause with all the problems here, with all the horrible things, what -- whether it\u2122s -- from the politicians and the -- the crookedness, and th -- all that, I\u2122d still rather live here th an anywhere else. And we had a choice, and I get very annoyed with Americans that are critical. And I don\u2122t like the American flag being burned, I don\u2122t like this freedom of choice business. I don\u2122t mean the abortion issue, I mean freedom of c hoice of doing things that I -- I don\u2122t think the right thing to do, because I don\u2122t think you have to burn anything to make a statement, but that\u2122s my own opinion. But I am very conscious of the fact that historically, I wouldn\u2122t like it not to be re membered. Not me, because I\u2122ve been very lucky. Even through the war I was lucky, I survived with my parents. A tremen -- All of my aunts, and uncles, and cousins were killed in Auschwitz. I have one cousin, who\u2122s 77, who\u2122s here, who has got his Auschwitz numbers on his arm. He\u2122s married, he has a son, a nice Jewish doctor, and has two nice Jewish gran dchildren. And he\u2122s assimilated, totally, sometimes excessively, and it\u2122s really interesting, cause I asked him to donate his Auschwitz uniform, and he said he wasn\u2122t ready to part with it. On the other hand, he lived next door to some people who had a swastika hanging in their house. So -- And he also went overboard joining -- I probably should n\u2122t say this on tape, case he listens to it -- a very non-Jewish club, who now has been kind enough to admit some Jews, but I wouldn\u2122t deal too well with that, if I\u2122m not welcome, it\u2122s okay. I mean, it\u2122s not okay, but I wouldn\u2122t want to make a statement. But that\u2122s how he\u2122s dealt with it. He\u2122s got his own USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 62 demons, probably much worse than mine, caus e his mother died in Auschwitz. So, you can\u2122t really be critical of what other people, you know, do, and how people deal with it. But I think -- Well first of all, this Hidden Children thing ju st happened, so --"

            "answer": "I guess about five years ago, and there wa s an article in a New York magazine, and it was getting a lot of publicity, it was going to be like maybe a couple of hundred people or something, were going to gather at the Ma rriott Marquis Hotel, and my daughter called me and told me about it. And she said, how come I\u2122m not going? I said, \ufb01Well, I really hadn\u2122t thought about it, what am I going to do there?\ufb02 And it was Memorial Day weekend, and we were invited out to the Hamptons, which sounded like a much better thing to do. Then the more I read about it, and the more I thought about it, I said, you know, I think I\u2122m going to go. And I said to my husband, \ufb01Let\u2122s go out to the Hamptons, and I\u2122ll come back for the one day out of the tw o, and you stay, and that\u2122s that.\ufb02 Well, he came back with me, and I only went for one day. And I went early in the morning, and by lunchtime I called him, and I said, \ufb01Come. E lie Wiesel is speaking in the evening,\ufb02 and you know, and he did. And it was really a very interesting experience for me. And one of my friends who, at that first meeting, said I was like the Pollyanna of the group, saying the war was wonderful, and I had a lovely ch ildho -- and all of a sudden, you know, some things that weren\u2122t so wonderful came out somewhere along the way, which I wasn\u2122t even aware of. So I guess, you know, something is definitely there, and I -- I don\u2122t know if it\u2122s my personality or what, that likes to think the glass is half full, as opposed to half USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 63 empty. But it is definitely important that the museum is there. We went to the one in South Beach, which is really a wonderful -- a-and then, you know, sometimes, people have said an awful lot of money is going to all these buildings, and all of this stuff, you know, isn\u2122t there better ways of spending the money, and sometimes I\u2122m not sure. But I think the only way to possibly avoid it, or to teach childre n in this crazy world, when you hear about all these shootings at schools, and stuff, it\u2122s a nightmare. But I\u2122m not sure that it\u2122s -- goes to the right people. You know, it\u2122s -- I remember years ago, having meetings, and chairing a meeting, and giving a lecture to the people that are there, about not being late. But the people that were there, were there. The people that were that late, didn\u2122t hear my complaining, so I\u2122m not sure that the people who are going to do terrible things, are going to go to the Holocaust Muse um, listen to these tapes, and say, \ufb01Well, you know, we did terrible things to these people, maybe we won\u2122t do this.\ufb02 So, I don\u2122t know."

I didn\u2122t for a long time, and she teases me about it. I had all these pictures, after the war, that were taken, and I don\u2122t know why, but it wa s just sort of something that came up from time to time, and I always told her that when she was older, I would show it to her. There were all these dead bodies, all over the place, that were being shoveled up to be buried i-in the back of the synagogue, cause they couldn\u2122t be iden tified, and -- and there were just a lot of bodies all over the place that -- when we came back into Budapest, cause we were in hiding outside, and so I remember all these bodies and stuff, and shortly after we came back, they were hanging peop le. And you know, this -- these were all documented, and no, I didn\u2122t want to show her the pictures, fo r a long time. I\u2122m not sure whether they were upsetting for me, or whether I thought that she\u2122d be upset. I don\u2122t know. I did take her to a couple of movies, when she was like a young teenager, that were, I guess I thought age appropriate, and that she could handle. And it\u2122 s interesting, because my -- I\u2122ve changed. You know, now I feel if the people that were victims could handle it, you know, children should be able to handle it, too. I certainl y started younger with my grandson. I don\u2122t -- you know, I don\u2122t know. I guess timing. With my grandson, I was at the train station, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 65 waiting for somebody, and he put out his right hand like Heil, Hitler, and it really freaked me out, totally. And so -- I mean, he was little , maybe four, five years old. So I kind of kneeled -- you know, bent down, at his level, I said, \ufb01Adam, why did you do that?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Well, I just had seen that in \ufb01The Sound of Music.\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Well, yeah, that\u2122s what they did,\ufb02 I said, \ufb01but I have to tell you a story.\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01If you remember the story, some of those soldiers were the bad guys. And this was this guy, Adolf,\ufb02 anyhow, and I said, you know, \ufb01I don\u2122t really want you to do that, that\u2122s not a salute that is appropriate.\ufb02 I don\u2122t know what words I used, I was really kind of emotional about it. So then he said, \ufb01Will you tell me other stories about what happened to you?\ufb02 And I did, and actually at the Hidden Child ren, there was some wonderful books, and I had gotten some. And I read some to him, and then, subsequently he, you know, read \ufb01Anne Frank\ufb02 and all the other Holocaust related stories. But now, it\u2122s become like a joke, every time I give him a book, I sa y, \ufb01No, it\u2122s not about the Holocaust.\ufb02"

Because again, we\u2122re talking 50 some years ago, so just like New York, on the west side where I grew up, doesn\u2122t look anything like -- Lincoln Center wasn\u2122t anywhere near anything, you know, so I mean, just by nature of growth, and -- things change. My apartment looked pretty shabby from the outside. There was still a lot of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 71 bullet -- you know, bomb sh-shrapnel things in the buildings. The city is beautiful, and when we were looking out the window at night, we had a -- we stayed at the intercontinental, overlooking the Danube River, it\u2122s a beautiful, beautiful city, and it used to be called the Paris of the Danube. And all the royalty used to visit, and these shopping streets, like Madison Avenue, is -- was a beautiful, beautiful street. It\u2122s pretty crummy now. Has a lot of is -- American chain store, McDonalds, you know, and all that kind of stuff. It\u2122s -- The city\u2122s a little tacky, and sad looking, you know, but it\u2122s -- physically it\u2122s a beautiful city. I was very moved at the synagogue. The last time we were there, 20 some years ago, you -- it wasn\u2122t even opened. So that is changed a lot. And there a lot of Americans, including Tony Curtis, and the Louder family, who have given a lot of money to restore the synagogue. And they\u2122ve re -- all the furniture has been re-done, you know, all the benches, and pews. And all the names were taken off, in order to re-polish the furniture. So I spoke to the guy who was sort of escorting school groups around. And I said, \ufb01My grandfather, and my father, and my uncle, and mother, they all had their nametags -- you know, their nameplates here .\ufb02 So he said, \ufb01Give me their names.\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Come to the back,\ufb02 there\u2122s a little room in the back. And in old shoeboxes, in alphabetical order, he pulls out my grandfat her\u2122s, my father\u2122s, my mother\u2122s, and my uncle. That\u2122s whose son is here, as a survivor of Auschwitz. So I made a donation to the synagogue, and they put them on like little wooden plaques -- wooden pieces, they didn\u2122t do such a good job, but it was very nice of them to do that. And I brought it home, and I gave my mother\u2122s, my father\u2122s, my gr-grandfather\u2122s to my mother, and I gave my uncle\u2122s USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 72 to my cousin. We did have a choice of putti ng it back there. I\u2122m not sure why I bought them with me. They were selling, you know, new people now, raising money for the synagogue.

            "answer": "I don\u2122t know, it\u2122s -- it\u2122s sort of interesting, and it\u2122s a contradiction. Had it not been for the Hidden Children, had it not be en for the fact that I\u2122m conscious of this last generation, and probably my grandchildren, it would have been something of the past. But the past is a very important part of your whole being, and you can\u2122t ju st totally file it away. What impact it will have on the future, I no -- I don\u2122 t know. I think I\u2122m going through a stage, I don\u2122t know if because it\u2122s my mother, that I feel very vulnerable about it being sort of the last chapter, you know. I used to think I was young, and I used to think I was middleaged, and now I think, you kn ow, the senior, and AARP, a nd all that, it\u2122s like a whole other chapter, and I\u2122ve never lied about my age, so it\u2122s not a matter of saying I\u2122m younger than I am, but I think I have a little problem acknowledging that I\u2122m not in my 40\u2122s, I think I\u2122m stuck in my 40\u2122s. But I\u2122ve had the discussion with my daughter, and she says she\u2122s stuck in her 20\u2122s, so that kind of works, cause sh e\u2122s having a problem thinking that she\u2122s in her 40\u2122s. And she\u2122s got exactly the same lines that I have. And I guess that\u2122s genetic, you know? So, I just would like to think -- not even wish, I don\u2122t know, think that the next generation doesn\u2122t have any of this to deal with. I think historically, almost every generation has had a horrendous war, or something that\u2122s beyond their control. Whether it was a civil war movement, or Worl d War One, or Two, or lost someone in Korea, Vietnam. This was a little different, and my daughter, my grandchildren are quite involved in this Kosovo, whic h I probably think is as clos e as you can get. And it-it\u2122s so USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 74 sad that with all of the talk, and the political statements, that the bottom line is, there\u2122s nothing anybody can do, it\u2122s like a -- it\u2122s lik e a chain reaction. I mean, thousands of people are dying. And with all the stuff that\u2122s going there, it\u2122s still going on, and nobody can stop it. So, it\u2122s hard to be philosophical, because it\u2122s -- it\u2122s sort of -- it\u2122s empty words, you know. This is what happe ned. I would like it not to happen. That\u2122s not very profound, but I can\u2122t think of anything more . I\u2122ve been lucky, that\u2122s -- I guess that\u2122s a good way to end, because I think I been lu cky because in my life, the war could have been much worse. I had -- could have had mo re serious losses. I could have been in camps, which were more serious. And I\u2122m also lucky that my life after the war turned out to be a nice, and a good life. And I\u2122m very grateful for that."

There was a Hungarian Jewish doctor\u2122s association. Not Hungarian Catholic, Hungarian Jewish. And I\u2122m sure there was another one also. But th ey were very class conscious on every -- on every level.
