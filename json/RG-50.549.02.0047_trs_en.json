I mean, that\u2019s very old people, and it\u2019s very hard to think about.

Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and everything else on the Holocaust, and I\u2019ve -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but in many ways I have nice memories of certainly the -- the pre-war years, and my memories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things, it was also a nurturing time. I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me, and protecting me. Of providing me with food when there wasn\u2019t any to be had. I was a very finicky eater, it was a pain in the neck, you know, providing me with -- with anything I would eat. And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend who was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time. So, I think because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing in retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of the post-war trauma that a lot of my friends, who are my contemporaries, still have."

It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the Holocaust theme takes place. And it was basically about a father protecting his child.

I really related to it, because the whole process, in some ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept. So I never had their fear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the United States, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly flying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us. And to this day, you know, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing. And there was always a positive thing, that things would be okay. So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted to be sure that I wouldn\u2019t, and I guess I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense."

            "answer": "Right. That\u2019s absolutely true. That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to me in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the street, and asked us about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her, and disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended on it, and it\u2019s very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it\u2019s one thing, it\u2019s -- if it\u2019s -- yes, that\u2019s absolutely -- that\u2019s the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that -- that was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up that way, so it wasn\u2019t quite as difficult for me to deal with.

A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about stealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don\u2019t remember all that well, but I don\u2019t think it was a major discussion, but she said that when you\u2019re hungry, sometimes -- it was there, she didn\u2019t think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever.

My father -- I think the reason for that during the war years, 1s that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I don\u2019t know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn\u2019t look obviously Jewish, I had blue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish. He had a no -- you know, a nose that was more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing 1s -- had men just drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify. So, I think my father, during situations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone\u2019s house, or were stopped on the street, my father always stayed in the background.

During -- Before the hiding, during the -- 01 -- the bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the building, and we went down to the cellar, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to accomplish more, we stayed more in the background."

Every Sunday we went to the zoo, we went to the playground, we went to the amusement park, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the closet, or the wall of my room, and every evening after he came home from the office, we would play a game of identifying capitals. Countries all over the world, and eventually rivers, and oceans, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today. The fathers came home at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and getting you to bed, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with my father, and a -- a very loving relationship.

I mean, the very first thing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that was their food. You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly weren\u2019t poor. But we probably spent more money on the opera than we did on food, because food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in high school, whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in Jackson Heights, and every Sunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner. And we didn\u2019t. We had hot dogs, and beans, and I don\u2019t know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn\u2019t starve, but the quantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were. So, you know, I don\u2019t know what it would have been like. I think I assimilated very quickly. We got here in the spring of \u201947, and I went to a very fancy girl\u2019s camp in Maine, that my daughter subsequently went to, that\u2019s still there, and if I had granddaughters, they\u2019d be going there. And then I went to public schools, I went to Hunter High School, and Hunter College. And I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends. I spoke English, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking English and Hungarian, kind of half and half.

When I outgrew the dress, my mother would take from another dress, and lengthen it. This is when the war was going on, and shortly after when there -- first there was nothing to buy, and no material, no money, you know, and all that, but I remember always looking clean and neat, and you know, the war was not a reason to not behave properly, and not to look nice. And it\u2019s funny, because I said that to my husband just recently, and it sort of -- you look at some of these old war pictures, how people were going to concentration camp with suits and ties and hats. It\u2019s funny, I was watching -- we were watching \u201cRoman Holiday,\u201d -- oh, \u201cThree Coins in a Fountain\u201d last night, and I said to my husband that I think I was in the wrong generation because Louis Jordan looks so wonderful, and here they\u2019re walking around in ridiculous places, and he\u2019s in double breasted suits, and a tie, and she has gloves on, and a hat. And, you know, he opens doors, and I said, you know, always walking around now in jeans and khakis, sort of, you know, casual, because that\u2019s the world we live in, but I think I kind of like that.

I remember when we first met his parents, there were two incidents that made such an impression on me, and they\u2019re married, I don\u2019t know, 16 - 17 years. This young man\u2019s stepfather was telling a story about some incident, and how he was so lucky to have met up with Mussolini\u2019s doctor in Europe. I wasn\u2019t so excited by that story. And then we were talking about some -- something else at dinner, and they were talking about, you know, that Jewish lady comedian on TV. And I was going to say, what is this Jewish lady comedian. She has a name, she has a profession, but what\u2019s this with the Jewish lady? And I was very uncomfortable with that. And I don\u2019t think I carry religion, you know, on my shoulder. I\u2019m probably less religious than some of my friends. Some people say I belong to the church on Fifth Avenue, and all that kind of stuff. But there 1s sort of a -- you know, a different way of looking at things, and we have a whole bunch of friends who have either Gentile wives or husbands.

I said it\u2019s a sa -- it\u2019s like -- 1t\u2019s like a lithograph, except in sculptures, and I was -- such a funny question. But a lot of artists did that in order to raise money. Louise Nevillson was very supportive of Brandeis, and some museums were.

And we had a choice, and I get very annoyed with Americans that are critical. And I don\u2019t like the American flag being burned, I don\u2019t like this freedom of choice business. I don\u2019t mean the abortion issue, I mean freedom of choice of doing things that I -- I don\u2019t think the right thing to do, because I don\u2019t think you have to burn anything to make a statement, but that\u2019s my own opinion. But I am very conscious of the fact that historically, I wouldn\u2019t like it not to be remembered. Not me, because I\u2019ve been very lucky. Even through the war I was lucky, I survived with my parents. A tremen -- All of my aunts, and uncles, and cousins were killed in Auschwitz. I have one cousin, who\u2019s 77, who\u2019s here, who has got his Auschwitz numbers on his arm. He\u2019s married, he has a son, a nice Jewish doctor, and has two nice Jewish grandchildren. And he\u2019s assimilated, totally, sometimes excessively, and it\u2019s really interesting, cause I asked him to donate his Auschwitz uniform, and he said he wasn\u2019t ready to part with it. On the other hand, he lived next door to some people who had a swastika hanging 1n their house. So -- And he also went overboard joining -- I probably shouldn\u2019t say this on tape, case he listens to it -- a very non-Jewish club, who now has been kind enough to admit some Jews, but I wouldn\u2019t deal too well with that, if I\u2019m not welcome, it\u2019s okay.

            "answer": "I guess about five years ago, and there was an article in a New York magazine, and it was getting a lot of publicity, it was going to be like maybe a couple of hundred people or something, were going to gather at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, and my daughter called me and told me about it. And she said, how come I\u2019m not going? I said, \u201cWell, I really hadn\u2019t thought about it, what am I going to do there?\u201d And it was Memorial Day weekend, and we were invited out to the Hamptons, which sounded like a much better thing to do. Then the more I read about it, and the more I thought about it, I said, you know, I think I\u2019m going to go. And I said to my husband, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the Hamptons, and I\u2019Il come back for the one day out of the two, and you stay, and that\u2019s that.\u201d Well, he came back with me, and I only went for one day. And I went early in the morning, and by lunchtime I called him, and I said, \u201cCome. Elie Wiesel is speaking in the evening,\u201d and you know, and he did. And it was really a very interesting experience for me. And one of my friends who, at that first meeting, said I was like the Pollyanna of the group, saying the war was wonderful, and I had a lovely childho -- and all of a sudden, you know, some things that weren\u2019t so wonderful came out somewhere along the way, which I wasn\u2019t even aware of.

But it is definitely important that the museum is there. We went to the one in South Beach, which is really a wonderful -- a-and then, you know, sometimes, people have said an awful lot of money is going to all these buildings, and all of this stuff, you know, isn\u2019t there better ways of spending the money, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure. But I think the only way to possibly avoid it, or to teach children in this crazy world, when you hear about all these shootings at schools, and stuff, it\u2019s a nightmare. But I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s -- goes to the right people. You know, it\u2019s -- I remember years ago, having meetings, and chairing a meeting, and giving a lecture to the people that are there, about not being late. But the people that were there, were there. The people that were that late, didn\u2019t hear my complaining, so I\u2019m not sure that the people who are going to do terrible things, are going to go to the Holocaust Museum, listen to these tapes, and say, \u201cWell, you know, we did terrible things to these people, maybe we won\u2019t do this.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know."

But the past is a very important part of your whole being, and you can\u2019t just totally file it away. What impact it will have on the future, I no -- I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m going through a stage, I don\u2019t know if because it\u2019s my mother, that I feel very vulnerable about it being sort of the last chapter, you know. I used to think I was young, and I used to think I was middle- aged, and now I think, you know, the senior, and AARP, and all that, it\u2019s like a whole other chapter, and I\u2019ve never lied about my age, so it\u2019s not a matter of saying I\u2019m younger than I am, but I think I have a little problem acknowledging that I\u2019m not in my 40\u2019s, I think I\u2019m stuck in my 40\u2019s. But I\u2019ve had the discussion with my daughter, and she says she\u2019s stuck in her 20\u2019s, so that kind of works, cause she\u2019s having a problem thinking that she\u2019s in her 40\u2019s.

So, I just would like to think -- not even wish, I don\u2019t know, think that the next generation doesn\u2019t have any of this to deal with. I think historically, almost every generation has had a horrendous war, or something that\u2019s beyond their control. Whether it was a civil war movement, or World War One, or Two, or lost someone in Korea, Vietnam. This was a little different, and my daughter, my grandchildren are quite involved in this Kosovo, which I probably think is as close as you can get.

I mean, thousands of people are dying. And with all the stuff that\u2019s going there, it\u2019s still going on, and nobody can stop it. So, it\u2019s hard to be philosophical, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of -- it\u2019s empty words, you know. This is what happened. I would like it not to happen. That\u2019s not very profound, but I can\u2019t think of anything more. I\u2019ve been lucky, that\u2019s -- I guess that\u2019s a good way to end, because I think I been lucky because in my life, the war could have been much worse. I had -- could have had more serious losses. I could have been in camps, which were more serious. And I\u2019m also lucky that my life after the war turned out to be a nice, and a good life.
