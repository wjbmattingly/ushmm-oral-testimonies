I mean, that\u2019s very old people, and it\u2019s very hard to think about. But I spent a lot of wonderful years, when I was in Budapest with my father, going to, not Disneyland, but to playgrounds, and theme parks, in a very small way, that - with roller coasters, and all that kind of stuff, so I have very fond memories of that."

            "answer": "That always stayed with me. It\u2019s really strange, because I know we\u2019re going to talk about the Hidden Children a little bit later, but the very first meeting I went to after our Hungarian group was formed, we sort of introduced each other, and everybody gave a little blurb of -- of the -- the war years, and I kind of ended up, not meaningly, sounding like a Pollyanna, because everybody was telling not just horror stories, but of how terribly it affected them afterwards. Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and everything else on the Holocaust, and I\u2019ve -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but in many ways I have nice memories of certainly the -- the pre-war years, and my memories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things, it was also a nurturing time. I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me, and protecting me. Of providing me with food when there wasn\u2019t any to be had. I was a very finicky eater, it was a pain in the neck, you know, providing me with -- with anything I would eat. And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend who was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time. So, I think because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing in retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of the post-war trauma that a lot of my friends, who are my contemporaries, still have."

A lot of my friends thought the movie fictionalized, and trivialized the Holocaust, and I think you would have had to see the movie to know what I\u2019m talking about, but it\u2019s -- when you see the movie, knowing it\u2019s about the Holocaust -- when I first went to the movies, for the first 20 minutes I thought I was 1n the wrong movie, because there was a comedy. It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the Holocaust theme takes place. And it was basically about a father protecting his child. I didn\u2019t think it was trivialized at all. I really related to it, because the whole process, in some ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept. So I never had their fear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the United States, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly flying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us. And to this day, you know, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing. And there was always a positive thing, that things would be okay. So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted to be sure that I wouldn\u2019t, and I guess I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense."

            "answer": "Right. That\u2019s absolutely true. That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to me in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the street, and asked us about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her, and disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended on it, and it\u2019s very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it\u2019s one thing, it\u2019s -- if it\u2019s -- yes, that\u2019s absolutely -- that\u2019s the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that -- that was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up that way, so it wasn\u2019t quite as difficult for me to deal with. You know, your -- you speak when you\u2019re spoken to, and you don\u2019t question a lot, and I don\u2019t think today\u2019s generation would get away with that."

A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about stealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don\u2019t remember all that well, but I don\u2019t think it was a major discussion, but she said that when you\u2019re hungry, sometimes -- it was there, she didn\u2019t think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever. I was 10 years old, so I didn\u2019t go into it, in major, you know, depth."

            "answer": "I think so. My father and I had a wonderful relationship. He was a very quiet and very loving man, very successful in business. My father -- I think the reason for that during the war years, 1s that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I don\u2019t know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn\u2019t look obviously Jewish, I had blue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish. He had a no -- you know, a nose that was more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing 1s -- had men just drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify. So, I think my father, during situations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone\u2019s house, or were stopped on the street, my father always stayed in the background. In -- You know, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection during -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my mother was very protective of his health. During -- Before the hiding, during the -- 01 -- the bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the building, and we went down to the cellar, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to accomplish more, we stayed more in the background."

            "question": "When you were growing up, though, before you were 10, before all of this happened, was he a strong presence?",
            "answer": "Oh yes, definitely. Every Sunday we went to the zoo, we went to the playground, we went to the amusement park, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the closet, or the wall of my room, and every evening after he came home from the office, we would play a game of identifying capitals. Countries all over the world, and eventually rivers, and oceans, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today. The fathers came home at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and getting you to bed, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with my father, and a -- a very loving relationship. In some ways, I think I was probably closer to him."

You -- You know, children fall into a lifestyle that they\u2019re in, and they don\u2019t say what would it have been like if I had been kosher, or -- or lived in -- I don\u2019t know, the lower east side, or somewhere else. I mean, the very first thing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that was their food. You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly weren\u2019t poor. But we probably spent more money on the opera than we did on food, because food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in high school, whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in Jackson Heights, and every Sunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner. And we didn\u2019t. We had hot dogs, and beans, and I don\u2019t know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn\u2019t starve, but the quantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were. So, you know, I don\u2019t know what it would have been like. I think I assimilated very quickly. We got here in the spring of \u201947, and I went to a very fancy girl\u2019s camp in Maine, that my daughter subsequently went to, that\u2019s still there, and if I had granddaughters, they\u2019d be going there. And then I went to public schools, I went to Hunter High School, and Hunter College. And I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends. I spoke English, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking English and Hungarian, kind of half and half. I started with one language and finished Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection with the other with my parents. I mean, they spoke English with an accent, but they certainly spoke it well enough. And I married an American, and I had absolutely no reason, so I definitely assimilated, and I think maybe if I had been more religious, I would have assimilated differently, or not as easily."

My ex-husband was a very good father, but 1-it -- it was more the roles, you know, I was at home, and had dinner ready, and the baby bathed, and all that, and he did a lot of stuff with her, because I think in our generation, I think that was becoming more of the thing, but they were the -- th -- they made the money, and I mean, you know, they had to go to work.

And it was interesting, this has nothing to do with the Holocaust, but I was watching Larry King yesterday, and Mary Tyler Moore was interviewed, and she said that was the one thing, if she had to do it all over again, she would have been home. I think she lost her child. There were a lot of tragedies there. I don\u2019t even know if she has any now, but I think her child either OD\u2019d, or something bad happened. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember what it was, but she was very adamant about it, and almost teary, that you owe your children, if you have them, to spend time with them.

We formed the group Hidden, not a concentration camp, so a very different -- you know, who you could be in order to belong to this group. And we meet in New York, and there are a handful of people who have apartments in New York, I -- everybody else outside of New York, nobody wants to go to Forest Hills, New Jersey, Brooklyn, so the New Yorkers have been, you know having the meetings, which is fine. And there\u2019s some very, very nice people. But the fact that you\u2019re Hungarian and Jewish is not enough to have a relationship.

And it was costly then, too. And Hunter was a very fine school, it was available, and didn\u2019t cost anything. That was probably a big disappointment, because a lot of my friends were going, you know, out of town. I had a lot of private school friends by that time, because of camp, and -- and Sunday school.

And some jewelry, you know, and things. The next level of -- you know, when your husband does well, that next level of luxury. And I\u2019ve always loved going to museums and galleries. And I was involved with Brandeis University National Women\u2019s Committee. And the National Women\u2019s Committee was the sole supporter of the library, because it was a fairly new school, and they didn\u2019t have the alumni money coming in for a library, so the women, when the school was first formed, non-sectarian Jewish school, because education was very important, we supported the library. We had a very active chapter -- junior chapter in New York, young. There was an older -- our parent\u2019s generation, they formed a younger chapter, and I was very much involved with that. And we did a lot of book reviews, and art classes, and I guess intellectually stimulating things, as opposed to a lot of other people were playing -- younger people, that had some free time were starting to play Mah Jongg, or Canasta, and all that kind of stuff, so this was -- we had a stock group, we were learning about that, so whatever was interesting, and I was always interested in that. We went to look at the Barnes collection. And there were a lot of artists popping up that were contemporary, unknown. Galleries that were appearing in Soho, that were new. Andy Warhol was becoming, O.K Harris Gallery was -- he used to give ladies art classes, before he opened the gallery. And they would donate stuff, and we would auction it off, or sell it, or whatever. And I was just really interested. Some of the galleries would give us cocktail parties, and fundraisers, and stuff, and that\u2019s how that Picasso lino cut back there, it was the first thing that I bought, that was an independent thing, and it was a lot of money at the time.

Louise Nevillson was very supportive of Brandeis, and some museums were. And that was a very -- a less expensive way of acquiring things, because they were multiples, they were one of 50, one of a hundred, whatever.

It\u2019s just -- gives me pleasure, I -- I just like it. We have some stuff really, and actually it\u2019s in the closets, that are very angry, and -- stuff I wouldn\u2019t want to hang.

I think what happened, and I don\u2019t know how accurate this 1s, but I think the period of assimilation had passed. I assimilated, I grew up, I was an American teenager, I was married, you know. It is now at the point in time, where with my generation, it\u2019s all over, except these tapes. I didn\u2019t think about that 20 or 30 years ago. I wanted to go on with my life, and my parents wanted to go on with their lives. I mean, we were all very happy to be here, and still today, when people criticize this country, my European side comes out, and I always want to say, go away. If you don\u2019t like it here, go wherever it\u2019s better. Cause with all the problems here, with all the horrible things, what -- whether it\u2019s -- from the politicians and the -- the crookedness, and th -- all that, I\u2019d still rather live here than anywhere else. And we had a choice, and I get very annoyed with Americans that are critical. And I don\u2019t like the American flag being burned, I don\u2019t like this freedom of choice business. I don\u2019t mean the abortion issue, I mean freedom of choice of doing things that I -- I don\u2019t think the right thing to do, because I don\u2019t think you have to burn anything to make a statement, but that\u2019s my own opinion. But I am very conscious of the fact that historically, I wouldn\u2019t like it not to be remembered. Not me, because I\u2019ve been very lucky. Even through the war I was lucky, I survived with my parents. A tremen -- All of my aunts, and uncles, and cousins were killed in Auschwitz. I have one cousin, who\u2019s 77, who\u2019s here, who has got his Auschwitz numbers on his arm. He\u2019s married, he has a son, a nice Jewish doctor, and has two nice Jewish grandchildren. And he\u2019s assimilated, totally, sometimes excessively, and it\u2019s really interesting, cause I asked him to donate his Auschwitz uniform, and he said he wasn\u2019t ready to part with it. On the other hand, he lived next door to some people who had a swastika hanging 1n their house. So -- And he also went overboard joining -- I probably shouldn\u2019t say this on tape, case he listens to it -- a very non-Jewish club, who now has been kind enough to admit some Jews, but I wouldn\u2019t deal too well with that, if I\u2019m not welcome, it\u2019s okay. I mean, it\u2019s not okay, but I wouldn\u2019t want to make a statement. But that\u2019s how he\u2019s dealt with it. He\u2019s got his own Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection demons, probably much worse than mine, cause his mother died in Auschwitz. So, you can\u2019t really be critical of what other people, you know, do, and how people deal with it. But I think -- Well first of all, this Hidden Children thing just happened, so --"

And she said, how come I\u2019m not going? I said, \u201cWell, I really hadn\u2019t thought about it, what am I going to do there?\u201d And it was Memorial Day weekend, and we were invited out to the Hamptons, which sounded like a much better thing to do. Then the more I read about it, and the more I thought about it, I said, you know, I think I\u2019m going to go. And I said to my husband, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to the Hamptons, and I\u2019Il come back for the one day out of the two, and you stay, and that\u2019s that.\u201d Well, he came back with me, and I only went for one day. And I went early in the morning, and by lunchtime I called him, and I said, \u201cCome. Elie Wiesel is speaking in the evening,\u201d and you know, and he did. And it was really a very interesting experience for me. And one of my friends who, at that first meeting, said I was like the Pollyanna of the group, saying the war was wonderful, and I had a lovely childho -- and all of a sudden, you know, some things that weren\u2019t so wonderful came out somewhere along the way, which I wasn\u2019t even aware of. So I guess, you know, something is definitely there, and I -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my personality or what, that likes to think the glass is half full, as opposed to half empty. But it is definitely important that the museum is there. We went to the one in South Beach, which is really a wonderful -- a-and then, you know, sometimes, people have said an awful lot of money is going to all these buildings, and all of this stuff, you know, isn\u2019t there better ways of spending the money, and sometimes I\u2019m not sure. But I think the only way to possibly avoid it, or to teach children in this crazy world, when you hear about all these shootings at schools, and stuff, it\u2019s a nightmare. But I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s -- goes to the right people. You know, it\u2019s -- I remember years ago, having meetings, and chairing a meeting, and giving a lecture to the people that are there, about not being late. But the people that were there, were there. The people that were that late, didn\u2019t hear my complaining, so I\u2019m not sure that the people who are going to do terrible things, are going to go to the Holocaust Museum, listen to these tapes, and say, \u201cWell, you know, we did terrible things to these people, maybe we won\u2019t do this.\u201d So, I don\u2019t know."

I didn\u2019t for a long time, and she teases me about it. I had all these pictures, after the war, that were taken, and I don\u2019t know why, but it was just sort of something that came up from time to time, and I always told her that when she was older, I would show it to her. There were all these dead bodies, all over the place, that were being shoveled up to be buried 1- in the back of the synagogue, cause they couldn\u2019t be identified, and -- and there were just a lot of bodies all over the place that -- when we came back into Budapest, cause we were in hiding outside, and so I remember all these bodies and stuff, and shortly after we came back, they were hanging people. And you know, this -- these were all documented, and no, I didn\u2019t want to show her the pictures, for a long time. I\u2019m not sure whether they were upsetting for me, or whether I thought that she\u2019d be upset. I don\u2019t know. I did take her to a couple of movies, when she was like a young teenager, that were, I guess I thought age appropriate, and that she could handle. And it\u2019s interesting, because my -- I\u2019ve changed. You know, now I feel if the people that were victims could handle it, you know, children should be able to handle it, too. I certainly started younger with my grandson. I don\u2019t -- you know, I don\u2019t know. I guess timing. With my grandson, I was at the train station, waiting for somebody, and he put out his right hand like Heil, Hitler, and it really freaked me out, totally. And so -- I mean, he was little, maybe four, five years old. So I kind of kneeled -- you know, bent down, at his level, I said, \u201cAdam, why did you do that?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I just had seen that in \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, yeah, that\u2019s what they did,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I have to tell you a story.\u201d And I said, \u201cIf you remember the story, some of those soldiers were the bad guys. And this was this guy, Adolf,\u201d anyhow, and I said, you know, \u201cI don\u2019t really want you to do that, that\u2019s not a salute that 1s appropriate.\u201d I don\u2019t know what words I used, I was really kind of emotional about it. So then he said, \u201cWill you tell me other stories about what happened to you?\u201d And I did, and actually at the Hidden Children, there was some wonderful books, and I had gotten some. And I read some to him, and then, subsequently he, you know, read \u201cAnne Frank\u201d and all the other Holocaust related stories. But now, it\u2019s become like a joke, every time I give him a book, I say, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not about the Holocaust.\u201d"

Because again, we\u2019re talking 50 some years ago, so just like New York, on the west side where I grew up, doesn\u2019t look anything like -- Lincoln Center wasn\u2019t anywhere near anything, you know, so I mean, just by nature of growth, and -- things change. My apartment looked pretty shabby from the outside. There was still a lot of bullet -- you know, bomb sh-shrapnel things in the buildings. The city is beautiful, and when we were looking out the window at night, we had a -- we stayed at the intercontinental, overlooking the Danube River, it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful city, and it used to be called the Paris of the Danube. And all the royalty used to visit, and these shopping streets, like Madison Avenue, 1s -- was a beautiful, beautiful street. It\u2019s pretty crummy now. Has a lot of is -- American chain store, McDonalds, you know, and all that kind of stuff. It\u2019s -- The city\u2019s a little tacky, and sad looking, you know, but it\u2019s -- physically it\u2019s a beautiful city. I was very moved at the synagogue. The last time we were there, 20 some years ago, you -- it wasn\u2019t even opened. So that is changed a lot. And there a lot of Americans, including Tony Curtis, and the Louder family, who have given a lot of money to restore the synagogue. And they\u2019ve re -- all the furniture has been re-done, you know, all the benches, and pews. And all the names were taken off, in order to re-polish the furniture. So I spoke to the guy who was sort of escorting school groups around. And I said, \u201cMy grandfather, and my father, and my uncle, and mother, they all had their nametags -- you know, their nameplates here.\u201d So he said, \u201cGive me their names.\u201d And he said, \u201c\u201cCome to the back,\u201d there\u2019s a little room in the back. And in old shoeboxes, in alphabetical order, he pulls out my grandfather\u2019s, my father\u2019s, my mother\u2019s, and my uncle. That\u2019s whose son is here, as a survivor of Auschwitz. So I made a donation to the synagogue, and they put them on like little wooden plaques -- wooden pieces, they didn\u2019t do such a good job, but it was very nice of them to do that. And I brought it home, and I gave my mother\u2019s, my father\u2019s, my gr-grandfather\u2019s to my mother, and I gave my uncle\u2019s to my cousin. We did have a choice of putting it back there. I\u2019m not sure why I bought them with me. They were selling, you know, new people now, raising money for the synagogue. I don\u2019t know why, I just wa -- I ge -- I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m not sure whether I shouldn\u2019t have just had them put it back, you know, on the -- on the pews, or what they had planned to do. But when they had them in the back, and they said, \u201cWould you like them?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I would.\u201d So that was quite moving, and Adam was quite impressed, moved, whatever.

And she\u2019s got exactly the same lines that I have. And I guess that\u2019s genetic, you know? So, I just would like to think -- not even wish, I don\u2019t know, think that the next generation doesn\u2019t have any of this to deal with. I think historically, almost every generation has had a horrendous war, or something that\u2019s beyond their control. Whether it was a civil war movement, or World War One, or Two, or lost someone in Korea, Vietnam. This was a little different, and my daughter, my grandchildren are quite involved in this Kosovo, which I probably think is as close as you can get. And it-it\u2019s so sad that with all of the talk, and the political statements, that the bottom line is, there\u2019s nothing anybody can do, it\u2019s like a -- it\u2019s like a chain reaction. I mean, thousands of people are dying. And with all the stuff that\u2019s going there, it\u2019s still going on, and nobody can stop it. So, it\u2019s hard to be philosophical, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of -- it\u2019s empty words, you know. This is what happened. I would like it not to happen. That\u2019s not very profound, but I can\u2019t think of anything more. I\u2019ve been lucky, that\u2019s -- I guess that\u2019s a good way to end, because I think I been lucky because in my life, the war could have been much worse. I had -- could have had more serious losses. I could have been in camps, which were more serious. And I\u2019m also lucky that my life after the war turned out to be a nice, and a good life. And I\u2019m very grateful for that."

The formal would be to teachers, and parents, and all of that. Then there\u2019s a third one that you would speak to -- with lower class or upper class. I mean, I can\u2019t describe it to you, but like a housekeeper would use a different way of speaking to, than -- and so -- and that still exists, and it\u2019s very interesting, because people will remain in that category of behavior, and it\u2019s not that- anything that\u2019s expected or -- or anything 1n today\u2019s world, but it still exists. And my parents, and a lot of their friends, that -- some people they met here, some people they knew from Europe, they came here -- they came here maybe with a little bit of money because they had visas where there was visitors, or perman -- mostly visitors, and then they applied for a permanent, and eventually became citizens. But 80 or 90 percent of my mother\u2019s friends became majorly, majorly successful. Speaking with accents, not speaking very good English, and a lot of them became import, export business, in the toy building, and the gift building. Some attorneys went back to school. There was a Hungarian Jewish doctor\u2019s association. Not Hungarian Catholic, Hungarian Jewish. And I\u2019m sure there was another one also. But they were very class conscious on every -- on every level. And then the next group of people that came, it was 1956, and that was referred to as the 1956, as those people really came with just the clothes on their back, because they were escaping after the revolution. And even some of those people have done extremely well. So, especially the Jews that came to this country, the educated Jews, had a tremendous thirst for success again, and most of -- a businessman is a businessman, if he can sell that, he can sell this. And that\u2019s exactly what -- what happened. I mean, historically, even in -- even in government, I mean, there\u2019s some Hungarians, and for a little country, that\u2019s amazing, to be prominent people on Wall Street, and in business, and politics, that have come out of it, so --"
