So, at one point, I had the nickname Tea from Thea, but I don\u2122t remember being called that.

I was calle d \ufb01Dorica\ufb02 as a child. So, if we go back now, I\u2122m still called Dorica, and at home, I ofte n was also called \ufb01Dorek\ufb02, and when I came here, I became \ufb01Dora\ufb02, and that\u2122s how it\u2122s \u0152 it\u2122s sticking to that one now."

            "answer": "I was born in Zagreb. I was born in Zagreb, apparently. I checked that about two years after my parents were married, and I lived ther e only the first two and a half, three years of my life. My mother was not originally Zagreb. My father\u2122s family lived in Zagreb, and that not for a very long time in history. I mean, they came, I think, when my father was already in his early teens or so. They came mostly from Bosnia. They were not however Sefardi. They had come there from, I think, elsewhere in Europe. And then came to live in Zagreb, and my father\u2122s family tended to be cantors. They were very \u0152 it was a very religious family, and they studied cantorial music and one of them, one of my uncles, Arnold, was actually a cantor and had studied very seriously. Another uncle, Joseph, also studied seriously. My father, I think, went to Ludbreg, to another little town, to \u0152 also to be a cantor at times, and met my mother. So, my mother\u2122s family was from a different town. They were from the town, a very sma ll town called Ludbreg; it\u2122 s further north from Zagreb on the Hungarian border, really very close to Hungary, but that town, in contrast to others, did not have a Hungarian population. I never learned Hungarian. My mother apparently did. My grandfather on my mother\u2122s side was the rabbi of that town, Ludbreg. There were some 30 plus Jewish families. I think about, according to some books that I\u2122ve seen, about 37 Jewish families. And my grandfather, I believe, was invited to come and be a rabbi there, and they came from Czechoslovakia, and he \u0152 he came from Bratislava already with his \u0152 with the fam ily, and so I don\u2122t know exactly how old he was, but from what I gather, most of his wr iting, he did quite a bit of writing, published, was in German, though he did learn Croatian, spoke in Croatian, but I think all of his writing is in German. I have papers wher e he wrote by hand and you can see that. Though his publications are in Croatian \u0152 I have so me of the stuff that he published mostly treaties on the Torah and so on, so I don\u2122t know exactly. I\u2122ve only been told all these 3 things, and I don\u2122t know really if he wrote in German and someone translated, or whether he wrote directly in Croatian."

            "answer": "Giza plays an important role in my life. Well, Blanka does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of t ogether. The family lived togeth er. It was a small town. Giza was ten years, I\u2122m sorry, fifteen years older than my mother. So, she often was sort of active as my mother\u2122s mother in they \u0152 I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the seashore. The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters \u0152 Zdenka and Vera. Their name was Appler, and the youngest \u0152 the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a school in Cakovec which is another small town, much larger to wn actually than Ludbreg, much closer even to the Hungarian border, and she went ther e to a teacher\u2122s \u0152 a teacher\u2122s school, became an elementary school teacher. The middle si ster who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to Ludbreg, opened a store, a nd that\u2122s \u0152 and that\u2122s where they had two children. The oldest of the three, Giza, worked in the bank, in the Ludbreg Bank, and there she met a person who was to play a la rge part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic. Ljudevit is actually his real name. I\u2122 ll get back to him. The brother Erne worked in Zagreb, worked early in Zagreb, and I\u2122m not exactly sure what he did there. I think clerical work of some sort. I\u2122m not sure of what he did. A nd the \u0152 my mother eventually finished the teacher\u2122s school and worked as a teacher in a small village near Ludbreg for a short period of time. Then my father and sh e met and married and left to live in Zagreb, and that\u2122s how I happened to have been born in Zagreb."

So, if you can, as you speak, make that distinction, it might be very helpful. So, this is what my first question is for 4 you.

            "answer": "Yes, I have in my head an image of my moth er, but it\u2122s very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have . And so it\u2122s very difficult because I\u2122ve seen those pictures all my life. It\u2122s very difficu lt to really distinguish what\u2122s memory and what\u2122s a photograph that you have in your head. So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can\u2122t really tell you whether I do or don\u2122t. I think I have an image of myself leaving on a train, because I left apparently when I wa s three years old. I left Zagreb with friends of my grandparents and went to Ludbreg, a nd that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand. And, again, I don\u2122t have any idea whether \u0152 because people often ask me whether I remember whet her I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what\u2122s going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already \u0152 my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I \u0152 whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby? I have no \u0152 no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity. These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don\u2122t remember being tearful or I don\u2122t remember th e farewell. I don\u2122t remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents. I don\u2122t remember any farewells. I remember sort of being on the train and there being fun."

I remember at Pesach, or before Pesach. I remember that they were burying silverware, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that\u2122s apparently what can be done. I found that much later. I had no idea of that. I remember my grandfather sitting in the ga rden with all of us playing around and he used to \u0152 he used to have his little table in front. This was, mind you, we were living in the house that was attached to the synagogue, and it was also \u0152 and everything \u0152 all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there. So, there was also the school and there were some kind of classrooms, and, of course, that was there much later.

Ludbreg is sort of like the county seat, and there were many surrounding villages, and those villages did not have either their own Jewish anything, nor did they have even middle schools. For example, later on when I went to middle school, people, kids from those villages would come to school, and that was also the place where market that was happening, and any ki nd of official papers were held and so on and so forth.

So, there was constant comings and goings, so that I don\u2122t know who said what, and in fact, I remember that evening in 8 particular when my brother arrived, and then I remember also being sort of distracted later on the next day by my two cousins who took me away. I spent much time with them. So, I was just sort of floating between these families. I don\u2122t remember being particularly rooted in one place or another. But, a nyway, the reason \u0152 what happened with my brother. That must have after the fall of Yugoslavia, April \u212241.

We had \u0152 I don\u2122t know if it was a housekeeper or somebody who lived nearby, a non-Jewish woman, and she went and was able to get my brother out.

Then she got him out, and she must have phoned Ludbreg, I mean, I know she did because I went through that story before, and they immediately \u0152 the olde st sister, Giza and her husband who was not Jewish, Ludva Vrancic, they went immediately to Zagreb a nd they got my brother, and they brought him back to Ludbreg. And that\u2122s \u0152 that\u2122s what happened that night, and that\u2122s \u0152 they brought him and he was there. He was nine months old at that time, and so he was crying and carrying on, and that\u2122s about what I remember of that. And I remember everybody being nervous and upset and-"

There were lists, and they, you know, the Ustashe came to Ludbreg and, they \u0152 people were being rounded up. I was not aware of that as such, but I do remember people leaving and I remember be ing left behind, and I didn\u2122t know exactly what was happening. Perhaps, again, they told me, but I didn\u2122t understand what they were telling me. But, as I mentioned, my Aunt Bla nka and her family lived next door to Aunt Giza and Ludjevit, and basically I remember at one point people coming and we were all in one room and they came with satchels or small suitcases in their hands and pillows under their arms and saying goodbye and leavi ng. And I didn\u2122t know exactly what was going on and why were they leaving and w ho was crying, and I was sad because these were my cousins, but that\u2122s the image that I have in my head of their leaving. And I had the sense that it was, there was something th at was dangerous and bad and that people were being taken away. I don\u2122t have the image of my grandparents leaving. I don\u2122t remember that. I remember my cousins. I know that my grandparents were taken at the same time."

And then there was a proclamation by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who had left, should return, and if they return they will be spared, nothing will happen to them, and they stupidly returned. I have a very good friend of mine who still lives in Zagreb now. Her family, which was another family in Ludbreg left also, and had left be fore this proclamation and they cleverly did not return. They were the only Jewish family, in fact, that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return, actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning, and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisanheld territory in Kordun. But, people who returned believing that this was going, you know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone."

I have a feeling that I was not on the list. I had seen one of those lists. One of them is published in a book on Ludbre g, which I have, and it lists Ludbreg Jews, and my aunts are there, and everybody\u2122s listed, and I\u2122m not on the list, neither is my brother. I have a feeling that the must ha ve gotten the list maybe from the synagogue, from the community center, and of course, I was not, since I was not born in Ludbreg and I was not considered a, you know, a member of the Ludbreg Jews, I was from Zagreb, I was not on that list. That\u2122s a possibility. But the other thing is that I know that many times we were warned that there would be a raid, and perhaps I \u0152 if they had been warned, they would have hidden someplace, but I always wondered why in the world were they sitting there? Like sitting ducks. Even I \u0152 I mean I didn\u2122t have a choice, of course, I was a child \u0152 but I\u2122m thinking, \ufb01Why in the world were we there?\ufb02 I recently, my aunt made a tape of her experiences-"

I was lik e, \ufb01Why were you there?\ufb02 You know, it\u2122s very hard for me to understand. It \u2122s not hard to understand why they didn\u2122t \u0152 why in some places there was no place to go, but I think in Ludbreg, one of the things about Ludbreg, it was a town that was very close to the \u0152 to wh ere the Partisans where. It\u2122s at the foot of the mountains, and of course, it was very diffi cult and Partisans had a very difficult life, but for those of us who were so vulnerable, why we didn\u2122t you go someplace into a small village or smaller village. I mean, this wa s small, but it wasn\u2122t really small, not by Croatian standards. Why we stayed there, I don\u2122t know. Faith that we would not be wanted? Or something? I don\u2122t really know. But I know that often with my Aunt Giza, we would \u0152 we would go places. I remember one time going to Varazdin, which is a larger town nearby, and staying with a relative, and I think this was the time that I understood that it was dangerous to stay and that we had to hide for a few days. The other \u0152 all the other hiding that I did was sort of nearby with \u0152 mostly with friends, and there were a number of families. There was the Zi za, the Runjak family, my brother and I would spend some time with, especially Ludbr eg \u0152 Ludbreg experienced a lot of fighting. We were really not so much in a concentra tion camp kind of situation. We were in a war \u0152 we were in a war zone. So, when it was \u0152 when it was time to hide because the Ustashe took town, then I spent, for example, time with this Runjak family, and they had rented from this other house which was now empty. They had rented that apartment, and we stayed with them. And I called Mrs. Runjak \ufb01Mother\ufb02 when I knew that it was dangerous, and I understood at that point what was dangerous, and my brother called her \ufb01Mother\ufb02 all the time because he wouldn\u2122t know how to distinguish from when it was dangerous and when it wasn\u2122t. So, I lived with them, a nd they had three teenage children, and it\u2122s thoroughly amazing because I remember Ustash e making camp in our backyard, and we were there, and just pretending that we were part of this other family. And it\u2122s amazing sometimes because the whole town essentially knew who we were. That\u2122s the most amazing part of all. In a small town like that, everybody knew that we were the rabbi\u2122s grandchildren, and at no point did anybody say, \ufb01What about these kids?\ufb02"

People across the street lost their one and only son. So, I thi nk -- unwittingly, I mean, not in an organized manner, but it just was not a kind of town that would \u0152 that would say, \ufb01Oh, well, go some place else.\ufb02 Or, \ufb01You\u2122re endangering us.\ufb02 I was endangering some of these people, and \u0152 but, they took us in anyway. So, but, anyway, our bad experiences during the war really had to do with the fighting, which everybody experienced, not just the Jews.

And the reason it\u2122s called that is because the memb ers of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives. They ki lled themselves at the end of the battle in a house that was down my street because they were totally su rrounded. They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn\u2122t want to be captured. Bu t there were fights and we would spend \u0152 we spent a lot of time in the basement. We had a cellar, not a basement in an American sense. It was a cellar. We had a vineyard, and we had wine, and there were big barrels down there, and shelves and shelves full of apples that were there for the winter. And at one point, we had beds down there, rolla way beds. And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting. Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and \u0152 not fo rget \u0152 I\u2122m sorry, we didn\u2122t know that we should go down there on time. So, then if a fi ght \u0152 if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the house to get \u0152 to go into the cellar, and so it was too dangerous already to do that.

He would\u2122ve been killed if not for the fact that I had been crying.

There were \u0152 the Ustashe would take people who were thought to be sympat hizers of the Partisans, which they were, many of them, and if they \u0152 sometimes they would catch them, some of them were sent to concentration camp and that in cludes my uncle, but my uncle who eventually married my aunt and he wasn\u2122t Jewish. I didn\u2122t explain that part, but at any rate, he ended up in concentration camp at one point in Jasenovac, and they would take them either to camp and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just in town, and I do have a very vivid image of going with one of our cleaning ladies to the main square and I wasn\u2122t supposed to see it. She was holding her hand on my eyes, but I saw it.

            "question": "This is the neighbor\u2122s.",
            "answer": "No, no, that belonged to th e Vrancic family. The Vrancic family had a house that was built by my uncle\u2122s father, and they came to Ludbreg when he was \u0152 when that father was very young. So, it was in the mid-1800s. They we re well educated and very old Croatian family. They count their ancestors to something like the 12 th century where there were 17 two famous Vrancic people. There was the Ca rdinal, and then there was an inventor, a fairly famous inventor by that name, and then the mother\u2122s family was called Svagel, and they were nobility, minor nobil ity, nevertheless, they had the PL, which is the approval of a _______ in their name, and the silver has that and so on. And they established themselves in this town, and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who remarried. They all died fairly young, not the ch ildren necessarily, some yes, but fairly \u0152 sort of as teenagers or young people, and as my memory goes, there were only two survivors and they were alrea dy in their fairly old age. One of them was Vika and the other was Ludva, and Vika remained single a nd died in the middle of the war, and I remember her quite well. Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that town. He was \u0152 he had been a mayor. He was a organizer of the sports club. He was the organizer of \u0152 he was the head of the soccer club even though he never played soccer. He organized everything in that town. He was especially having to do with music. He loved music. He played the violin. He organized two different kinds of orchestras. He was the heart of that town in terms of any kind of cultural life. When he fell in love with my aunt, and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catholic family, and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi, not exactly the right combination for the times, forever, but certainly not for that time. And he was ten years older than sh e, and they knew each other especially from the bank because he was a director of a part of another bank, and she worked there. And, again, I know that only from stories. I aske d him many times afterwards, \ufb01So, why didn\u2122t you get married for such a long time?\ufb02 Because they got married in 1937, I think, or 1939, I\u2122m not too sure. I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me, \ufb01Well, she was very happy living with her family, with her parents, and I was fine living with my sister and my mother. There was no need to get married.\ufb02 Well, I rather doubted that was how it was, but that\u2122s how he always said it. But I\u2122m sure that my grandparents did not \u0152 were not thrilled their daughter going with a Catholic person. However, in all the pictures of the family for a very long time, he\u2122s always present. So, it wasn\u2122t like he wasn\u2122t accepted totally, and I think by the time the war was imminent in Europe, and they knew what was happening, they decided to get married. So, they got married. They actually had to go to Hungary to get married because you coul dn\u2122t get married in a civil ceremony in Croatia or Yugoslavia, that is , and neither of them was converting to anything. So, they got married in a civil ce remony. So, the house that we basically had lived was the Vrancic house, and then they a nd my other aunt, the Appler family, decided to build a house of their own, but it was within the same compound, the same land base. So, that\u2122s how we ended up having these two houses that were next to one another, and the other one was supposed to be a big two-story house with a store on the bottom for my uncle, a small apartment in the back, which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there, and then there was supposed to be two apartments upstairs, and that never got finished, of course, before the war."

But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that house from then on, and that\u2122s, you know, I remember, that\u2122s \u0152 we were set then in that house from then on."

This was what was being sent, roux.

So, my father was there for also for quite awhile. He was taken with a number of other non-Jews from Ludbreg, and they were there, I can\u2122t remember for how long, but at least a year, I think, and I don\u2122t know why, I\u2122ve forgotten, but certainly I talked to him afterwards, but I don\u2122t have a good memory of how long he was ther e. But I do know all the stories he told me when he returned of how and why he su rvived, and basically they found out that \u0152 well, they knew \u0152 that he was a banker, and so they put him to work in an office in Jasenovac to balance their books, to work on the books, and so that he didn\u2122t have to be out in the rain and snow and people, there was one person in the office who was an Ustashe but not one of those \u0152 not one of those that went around killing people necessarily, and he was reasonably kind to him. In fact, after the war, I have definite memories of Stricek sending packages to hi m because later on, he was in jail, I mean, yeah, in jail for many years after the war. But this is so \u0152 the one thing that saved him was that. The other thing that saved him wa s that he was always, as I told you, an organizer of things cultural, and they wanted to have, the Ustashe wanted to have entertainment. So, he organized a chorus, and he collected anybody that he knew. So, there were some nieces of his \u0152 second niece beca use he didn\u2122t have brothers and sisters, cousins, two cousins\u2122 daughters were there \u0152 he collected all these people and they created a chorus. So, of course, he claimed to have to practice if they wanted to have a good performance. So, that saved them also from having to work so hard, and they\u2122d sometimes allow them access to some more food. He said my father, on the other hand, worked very hard. Nevertheless, my fa ther survived until the very end."

I think that my \u0152 Stricek remembers my father working with bricks, and carrying stones and bricks and things, but he was much, much younger. Stricek at that point, he was born in 1885, he was old, and he had this family of people who were dying with weak lungs at a moment\u2122s notice, and he was \u0152 he would have never made it.

There are many testimonies that I have li stened to now, and mu ch material that I had seen, that people would say that they were release d, and even Magda, we were talking to Magda. She was saying how people were collected to a camp in Zagreb and they were released to go home and get their clothes or something, and it seems that while they were extremely cruel, within Jasenovac, that they were also very disorganized, and sometimes people would come and go and they were constantly sending people from one place to another. I believe that was the most amazing thing that I found in reading the Jasenovac material, to what extent people were constantly being moved from Radiska to Jasenovac to Lepoglava, spending times on trai ns going back and forth, sometimes being released. It\u2122s amazing, and we haven\u2122t quite figured out. Lucie and I are both very surprised, and we haven\u2122t quite figured out what is the basis of that except that we feel that there was not a total organization."

One of them was my mother\u2122s brother. He\u2122s the only one actually of the entire Deutsch family who survived. On my father\u2122s side of the family, a few siblings survived, half of them. And this uncle, my Uncle Bernard, who goes now by Dov and lives in Israel, he survived because he was prisoner of war. He remained \u0152 he was in the Yugoslav Army, and became prisoner \u0152 actually, Erne was also prisoner of war. They both were in the army. They became prisoners of war, and so survived. It was a mu ch easier survival from what \u0152 I just spoke to Bernard very recently and he was telling me stories, how they basically lived the same way like the rest of the prisoners of war, and they were able to get packages and they were fed reasonably decently, et cetera, et cetera. So, the tw o of them returned. Both of them asked me to go with them, and I absolu tely refused. When I think about, at the age of seven, I was totally aghast that I would go with these people whom I didn\u2122t know. And my Uncle Bernard, Dov, got married to anothe r survivor, this survivor of the camps, to Estie (ph), she survived Auschwitz. They left Yugoslavia, and went to France, to the south of France, and then eventually to Israel where they still live. My other uncle, Erne, got remarried. His wife, Irma (ph), and daught er, Edita (ph), were killed. By the way, that\u2122s one of my really vivid memories \u0152 hi s daughter was at one point released from a concentration camp, and I remember her coming to my grandfather\u2122s house and being totally skin and bones, full of lice, and I remember that she looked weird, and they put tar on her head, and she just looked so crazy to me. And I was, obviousl y, a little girl, and again, she then continued to live in Ludbreg and not in total and absolute Anne Frank-style hiding, and then she was taken away again. But, anyway, she then was taken away and was killed. But he remarried, Erne re married, and married a woman who became a widow and had two children, and they eventually left for Israel, and I remained behind.

And, of course, after, you know, later on when I went to live with them for a year, and studied in Switzerland, I realized they were really very good people, and they did \u0152 they did a lot to enable me to be there. And, of course, Stricek did, too, because it costs money for me to go. My relatives in Switzerland didn\u2122t have any, and I didn\u2122t even realize that. We all thought, you know, just like people who would think mo ney grows on trees in America, well, you know, we all thought, \ufb01There\u2122s lots of money in Switzerland.\ufb02 Well, of course, they had very little. They had come from a concentr ation camp and they had nothing, and I lived better in many ways where I was. I was able to bring my aunt, as a present, a gold bracelet."
