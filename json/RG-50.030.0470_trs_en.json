So, at one point, I had the nickname Tea from Thea, but I don\u2019t remember being called that. Then, in Croatia, Dora is arather sort of, a name, a very folksy name used usually sort of used for old ladies, and that\u2019s not what I was ever called. I was called \u201cDorica\u201d as a child. So, if we go back now, I\u2019m still called Dorica, and at home, I often was also called \u201cDorek\u2019\u2019, and when I came here, I became \u201cDora\u2019\u2019, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s sticking to that one now."

So, it\u2019s very normal for someone from a Slavic country to use that, but it\u2019s really not \u2014 it sounds very strange, I think, in English. I know a young woman who lives here who\u2019s from Belgrade, and she\u2019s called Bekica, and it\u2019s Becky, and to me it\u2019s like sounds very strange. It\u2019s sort of like, you know, Dolly or something like that, and you don\u2019t use those names very much."

            "question": "In Zagreb?",
            "answer": "I was born in Zagreb. I was born in Zagreb, apparently. I checked that about two years after my parents were married, and I lived there only the first two and a half, three years of my life. My mother was not originally Zagreb. My father\u2019s family lived in Zagreb, and that not for a very long time in history. I mean, they came, I think, when my father was already in his early teens or so. They came mostly from Bosnia. They were not however Sefardi. They had come there from, I think, elsewhere in Europe. And then came to live in Zagreb, and my father\u2019s family tended to be cantors. They were very \u2014 it was a very religious family, and they studied cantorial music and one of them, one of my uncles, Arnold, was actually a cantor and had studied very seriously. Another uncle, Joseph, also studied seriously. My father, I think, went to Ludbreg, to another little town, to \u2014 also to be a cantor at times, and met my mother. So, my mother\u2019s family was from a different town. They were from the town, a very small town called Ludbreg; it\u2019s further north from Zagreb on the Hungarian border, really very close to Hungary, but that town, in contrast to others, did not have a Hungarian population. I never learned Hungarian. My mother apparently did. My grandfather on my mother\u2019s side was the rabbi of that town, Ludbreg. There were some 30 plus Jewish families. I think about, according to some books that I\u2019ve seen, about 37 Jewish families. And my grandfather, I believe, was invited to come and be a rabbi there, and they came from Czechoslovakia, and he \u2014 he came from Bratislava already with his \u2014 with the family, and so I don\u2019t know exactly how old he was, but from what I gather, most of his writing, he did quite a bit of writing, published, was in German, though he did learn Croatian, spoke in Croatian, but I think all of his writing is in German. I have papers where he wrote by hand and you can see that. Though his publications are in Croatian \u2014 I have some of the stuff that he published mostly treaties on the Torah and so on, so I don\u2019t know exactly. I\u2019ve only been told all these things, and I don\u2019t know really if he wrote in German and someone translated, or whether he wrote directly in Croatian."

I\u2019m sorry, they had three daughters and a son, four children. The oldest \u2014 the oldest daughter was Giza, then Blanka, and then Silva, and the son was Erne."

            "answer": "Giza plays an important role in my life. Well, Blanka does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of together. The family lived together. It was a small town. Giza was ten years, I\u2019m sorry, fifteen years older than my mother. So, she often was sort of active as my mother\u2019s mother in they \u2014 I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the seashore. The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters \u2014 Zdenka and Vera. Their name was Appler, and the youngest \u2014 the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a school in Cakovec which is another small town, much larger town actually than Ludbreg, much closer even to the Hungarian border, and she went there to a teacher\u2019s \u2014 a teacher\u2019s school, became an elementary school teacher. The middle sister who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to Ludbreg, opened a store, and that\u2019s \u2014 and that\u2019s where they had two children. The oldest of the three, Giza, worked in the bank, in the Ludbreg Bank, and there she met a person who was to play a large part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic. Ljudevit is actually his real name. Ill get back to him. The brother Erne worked in Zagreb, worked early in Zagreb, and I\u2019m not exactly sure what he did there. I think clerical work of some sort. I\u2019m not sure of what he did. And the \u2014 my mother eventually finished the teacher\u2019s school and worked as a teacher in a small village near Ludbreg for a short period of time. Then my father and she met and married and left to live in Zagreb, and that\u2019s how I happened to have been born in Zagreb."

So, 1f you can, as you speak, make that distinction, it might be very helpful. So, this is what my first question is for you. What is your \u2014 do you have any memories before 1941, before you leave Zagreb to go to Ludbreg?",
            "answer": "Images."
        },
        {
            "num": 18,
            "question": "Images?",
            "answer": "Yes, I have in my head an image of my mother, but it\u2019s very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have. And so it\u2019s very difficult because I\u2019ve seen those pictures all my life. It\u2019s very difficult to really distinguish what\u2019s memory and what\u2019s a photograph that you have in your head. So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can\u2019t really tell you whether I do or don\u2019t. I think I have an image of myself leaving on a train, because I left apparently when I was three years old. I left Zagreb with friends of my grandparents and went to Ludbreg, and that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand. And, again, I don\u2019t have any idea whether \u2014 because people often ask me whether I remember whether I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what\u2019s going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already \u2014 my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I \u2014 whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby? I have no \u2014 no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity. These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don\u2019t remember being tearful or I don\u2019t remember the farewell. I don\u2019t remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents. I don\u2019t remember any farewells. I remember sort of being on the train and there being fun."

If I had known nothing of that, and all of a sudden as an adult it came upon me, yes, of course, 1t would have been difficult. But I grew up with all of that. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s just part and parcel of my growing up. I always heard stories and always knew who I was and I always had these pictures so that, you know, it\u2019s, you know, you just to grow up with stories. That\u2019s all."

And \u201cbreg\u2019\u2019, I think, means a mountain, but it also could be the words got transposed and it was \u201cberg\u201d which means town. So, I don\u2019t know.

I remember at Pesach, or before Pesach. I remember that they were burying silverware, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that\u2019s apparently what can be done. I found that much later. I had no idea of that. I remember my grandfather sitting in the garden with all of us playing around and he used to \u2014 he used to have his little table in front. This was, mind you, we were living in the house that was attached to the synagogue, and it was also \u2014 and everything \u2014 all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there. So, there was also the school and there were some kind of classrooms, and, of course, that was there much later. It\u2019s been destroyed now, but \u2014 so, he would sit in the garden with the little table and he had little piles of money in front of him and there were beggars that were sort of like professional beggars in that town, and they would come Wednesdays and Saturdays because those were market days in Ludbreg, and on Saturdays, of course, he wouldn\u2019t do that, but \u2014 that\u2019s Shabbat, but on Wednesdays they would sit and they would come and take their little piles."

Ludbreg is sort of like the county seat, and there were many surrounding villages, and those villages did not have either their own Jewish anything, nor did they have even middle schools. For example, later on when I went to middle school, people, kids from those villages would come to school, and that was also the place where market that was happening, and any kind of official papers were held and so on and so forth. So, it was sort of a \u2014 basically like a county seat. So, anyway, back to the images of my grandfather. Those are the images that I have my grandparents, but of course-"

So, there was my grand \u2014 there were my grandparents and then only about two blocks away lived the middle sister, my mother\u2019s middle sister of the three sisters, Blanka with her husband and two of my cousins Vera and Zdenka, and then there was also Giza, who by that time was also married, and her husband Ludva, the Vrancic family. So, there was constant comings and goings, so that I don\u2019t know who said what, and in fact, I remember that evening in particular when my brother arrived, and then I remember also being sort of distracted later on the next day by my two cousins who took me away. I spent much time with them. So, I was just sort of floating between these families. I don\u2019t remember being particularly rooted in one place or another. But, anyway, the reason \u2014 what happened with my brother. That must have after the fall of Yugoslavia, April \u201941. My parents were apparently almost immediately taken into jail, led and my mother had my brother with me. We had \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was a housekeeper or somebody who lived nearby, a non-Jewish woman, and she went and was able to get my brother out. So, he was in jail with my parents for a very short period of time. Then she got him out, and she must have phoned Ludbreg, I mean, I know she did because I went through that story before, and they immediately \u2014 the oldest sister, Giza and her husband who was not Jewish, Ludva Vrancic, they went immediately to Zagreb and they got my brother, and they brought him back to Ludbreg. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what happened that night, and that\u2019s \u2014 they brought him and he was there. He was nine months old at that time, and so he was crying and carrying on, and that\u2019s about what I remember of that. And I remember everybody being nervous and upset and-"

There were lists, and they, you know, the Ustashe came to Ludbreg and, they \u2014 people were being rounded up. I was not aware of that as such, but I do remember people leaving and I remember being left behind, and I didn\u2019t know exactly what was happening. Perhaps, again, they told me, but I didn\u2019t understand what they were telling me. But, as I mentioned, my Aunt Blanka and her family lived next door to Aunt Giza and Ludjevit, and basically I remember at one point people coming and we were all in one room and they came with satchels or small suitcases in their hands and pillows under their arms and saying goodbye and leaving. And I didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on and why were they leaving and who was crying, and I was sad because these were my cousins, but that\u2019s the image that I have in my head of their leaving. And I had the sense that it was, there was something that was dangerous and bad and that people were being taken away. I don\u2019t have the image of my grandparents leaving. I don\u2019t remember that. I remember my cousins. I know that my grandparents were taken at the same time."

And then there was a proclamation by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who had left, should return, and if they return they will be spared, nothing will happen to them, and they stupidly returned. I have a very good friend of mine who still lives in Zagreb now. Her family, which was another family in Ludbreg left also, and had left before this proclamation and they cleverly did not return. They were the only Jewish family, in fact, that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return, actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning, and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisan- held territory in Kordun. But, people who returned believing that this was going, you know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone."

I have a feeling that I was not on the list. I had seen one of those lists. One of them is published in a book on Ludbreg, which I have, and it lists Ludbreg Jews, and my aunts are there, and everybody\u2019s listed, and I\u2019m not on the list, neither is my brother. I have a feeling that the must have gotten the list maybe from the synagogue, from the community center, and of course, I was not, since I was not born in Ludbreg and I was not considered a, you know, a member of the Ludbreg Jews, I was from Zagreb, I was not on that list. That\u2019s a possibility. But the other thing is that I know that many times we were warned that there would be a raid, and perhaps I \u2014 if they had been warned, they would have hidden someplace, but I always wondered why in the world were they sitting there? Like sitting ducks. Even I \u2014 I mean I didn\u2019t have a choice, of course, I was a child \u2014 but I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhy in the world were we there?\u201d I recently, my aunt made a tape of her experiences-"

I was like, \u201cWhy were you there?\u201d You know, it\u2019s very hard for me to understand. It\u2019s not hard to understand why they didn\u2019t \u2014 why in some places there was no place to go, but I think in Ludbreg, one of the things about Ludbreg, it was a town that was very close to the \u2014 to where the Partisans where. It\u2019s at the foot of the mountains, and of course, it was very difficult and Partisans had a very difficult life, but for those of us who were so vulnerable, why we didn\u2019t you go someplace into a small village or smaller village. I mean, this was small, but it wasn\u2019t really small, not by Croatian standards. Why we stayed there, I don\u2019t know. Faith that we would not be wanted? Or something? I don\u2019t really know. But I know that often with my Aunt Giza, we would \u2014 we would go places. I remember one time going to Varazdin, which 1s a larger town nearby, and staying with a relative, and I think this was the time that I understood that it was dangerous to stay and that we had to hide for a few days. The other \u2014all the other hiding that I did was sort of nearby with \u2014 mostly with friends, and there were a number of families. There was the Ziza, the Runjak family, my brother and I would spend some time with, especially Ludbreg \u2014 Ludbreg experienced a lot of fighting. We were really not so much in a concentration camp kind of situation. We were in a war \u2014 we were in a war zone. So, when it was \u2014 when it was time to hide because the Ustashe took town, then I spent, for example, time with this Runjak family, and they had rented from this other house which was now empty. They had rented that apartment, and we stayed with them. And I called Mrs. Runjak \u201cMother\u201d when I knew that it was dangerous, and I understood at that point what was dangerous, and my brother called her \u201cMother\u201d all the time because he wouldn\u2019t know how to distinguish from when it was dangerous and when it wasn\u2019t. So, I lived with them, and they had three teenage children, and it\u2019s thoroughly amazing because I remember Ustashe making camp in our backyard, and we were there, and just pretending that we were part of this other family. And it\u2019s amazing sometimes because the whole town essentially knew who we were. That\u2019s the most amazing part of all. In a small town like that, everybody knew that we were the rabbi\u2019s grandchildren, and at no point did anybody say, \u201cWhat about these kids?\u201d"

People across the street lost their one and only son. So, I think -- unwittingly, I mean, not in an organized manner, but it just was not a kind of town that would \u2014 that would say, \u201cOh, well, go some place else.\u201d Or, \u201cYou\u2019re endangering us.\u201d I was endangering some of these people, and \u2014 but, they took us in anyway. So, but, anyway, our bad experiences during the war really had to do with the fighting, which everybody experienced, not just the Jews.

I don\u2019t know how to translate \u2014 Brigade is Brigada, of course. Udarna means \u2014 it\u2019s striking, one who can strike well, particularly well. And the reason it\u2019s called that 1s because the members of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives. They killed themselves at the end of the battle in a house that was down my street because they were totally surrounded. They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn\u2019t want to be captured. But there were fights and we would spend \u2014 we spent a lot of time in the basement. We had a cellar, not a basement in an American sense. It was a cellar. We had a vineyard, and we had wine, and there were big barrels down there, and shelves and shelves full of apples that were there for the winter. And at one point, we had beds down there, rollaway beds. And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting. Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and \u2014 not forget \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, we didn\u2019t know that we should go down there on time. So, then if a fight \u2014 if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the house to get \u2014 to go into the cellar, and so it was too dangerous already to do that.

So, I was fairly well protected, but I was scared to death and I don\u2019t have any recollection of where my brother, but my aunt and uncle were sleeping in the room next to my room, and for some strange reason, I think everybody was kind of paralyzed that no one left there, but there was a window that was \u2014 that was right facing out from this bedroom, and I remember crying and asking for somebody to come, and finally my uncle got up and came, and no sooner did he come to comfort me than a bullet landed on the pillow of his bed. He would\u2019ve been killed if not for the fact that I had been crying.

I was more \u2014 I think there were some things that were just very scary, like seeing all these bodies going by. And there was a time that \u2014 an image that I have very much in my head again, that was another thing that happened in Ludbreg. There were \u2014 the Ustashe would take people who were thought to be sympathizers of the Partisans, which they were, many of them, and if they \u2014 sometimes they would catch them, some of them were sent to concentration camp and that includes my uncle, but my uncle who eventually married my aunt and he wasn\u2019t Jewish. I didn\u2019t explain that part, but at any rate, he ended up in concentration camp at one point in Jasenovac, and they would take them either to camp and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just in town, and I do have a very vivid image of going with one of our cleaning ladies to the main square and I wasn\u2019t supposed to see it. She was holding her hand on my eyes, but I saw it.

            "question": "This is the neighbor\u2019s.",
            "answer": "No, no, that belonged to the Vrancic family. The Vrancic family had a house that was built by my uncle\u2019s father, and they came to Ludbreg when he was \u2014 when that father was very young. So, it was in the mid-1800s. They were well educated and very old Croatian family. They count their ancestors to something like the 12\" century where there were two famous Vrancic people. There was the Cardinal, and then there was an inventor, a fairly famous inventor by that name, and then the mother\u2019s family was called Svagel, and they were nobility, minor nobility, nevertheless, they had the PL, which 1s the approval of a in their name, and the silver has that and so on. And they established themselves in this town, and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who remarried. They all died fairly young, not the children necessarily, some yes, but fairly \u2014 sort of as teenagers or young people, and as my memory goes, there were only two survivors and they were already in their fairly old age. One of them was Vika and the other was Ludva, and Vika remained single and died in the middle of the war, and I remember her quite well. Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that town. He was \u2014 he had been a mayor. He was a organizer of the sports club. He was the organizer of \u2014 he was the head of the soccer club even though he never played soccer. He organized everything in that town. He was especially having to do with music. He loved music. He played the violin. He organized two different kinds of orchestras. He was the heart of that town in terms of any kind of cultural life. When he fell in love with my aunt, and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catholic family, and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi, not exactly the right combination for the times, forever, but certainly not for that time. And he was ten years older than she, and they knew each other especially from the bank because he was a director of a part of another bank, and she worked there. And, again, I know that only from stories. I asked him many times afterwards, \u201cSo, why didn\u2019t you get married for such a long time?\u201d Because they got married in 1937, I think, or 1939, I\u2019m not too sure. I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me, \u201cWell, she was very happy living with her family, with her parents, and I was fine living with my sister and my mother. There was no need to get married.\u201d Well, I rather doubted that was how it was, but that\u2019s how he always said it. But I\u2019m sure that my grandparents did not \u2014 were not thrilled their daughter going with a Catholic person. However, in all the pictures of the family for a very long time, he\u2019s always present. So, it wasn\u2019t like he wasn\u2019t accepted totally, and I think by the time the war was imminent in Europe, and they knew what was happening, they decided to get married. So, they got married. They actually had to go to Hungary to get married because you couldn\u2019t get married in a civil ceremony in Croatia or Yugoslavia, that is, and neither of them was converting to anything. So, they got married in a civil ceremony. So, the house that we basically had lived was the Vrancic house, and then they and my other aunt, the Appler family, decided to build a house of their own, but it was within the same compound, the same land base. So, that\u2019s how we ended up having these two houses that were next to one another, and the other one was supposed to be a big two-story house with a store on the bottom for my uncle, a small apartment in the back, which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there, and then there was supposed to be two apartments upstairs, and that never got finished, of course, before the war."

But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that house from then on, and that\u2019s, you know, I remember, that\u2019s \u2014 we were set then in that house from then on."

This was what was being sent, roux. And so you \u2014 you made this brown mass which would then congeal and solidify, and then he would put \u2014 he would use that to put in the water to make sort of a soup."

            "answer": "He was in Jasenovac. He was Jasenovac, and eventually when he would return \u2014 luckily I found out, I mean, he was lucky that he returned, but he saw my father there. So, my father was there for also for quite awhile. He was taken with a number of other non-Jews from Ludbreg, and they were there, I can\u2019t remember for how long, but at least a year, I think, and I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve forgotten, but certainly I talked to him afterwards, but I don\u2019t have a good memory of how long he was there. But I do know all the stories he told me when he returned of how and why he survived, and basically they found out that \u2014 well, they knew \u2014 that he was a banker, and so they put him to work in an office in Jasenovac to balance their books, to work on the books, and so that he didn\u2019t have to be out in the rain and snow and people, there was one person in the office who was an Ustashe but not one of those \u2014 not one of those that went around killing people necessarily, and he was reasonably kind to him. In fact, after the war, I have definite memories of Stricek sending packages to him because later on, he was in jail, I mean, yeah, in jail for many years after the war. But this is so \u2014 the one thing that saved him was that. The other thing that saved him was that he was always, as I told you, an organizer of things cultural, and they wanted to have, the Ustashe wanted to have entertainment. So, he organized a chorus, and he collected anybody that he knew. So, there were some nieces of his \u2014 second niece because he didn\u2019t have brothers and sisters, cousins, two cousins\u2019 daughters were there \u2014 he collected all these people and they created a chorus. So, of course, he claimed to have to practice if they wanted to have a good performance. So, that saved them also from having to work so hard, and they\u2019d sometimes allow them access to some more food. He said my father, on the other hand, worked very hard. Nevertheless, my father survived until the very end."

I think that my \u2014 Stricek remembers my father working with bricks, and carrying stones and bricks and things, but he was much, much younger. Stricek at that point, he was born in 1885, he was old, and he had this family of people who were dying with weak lungs at a moment\u2019s notice, and he was \u2014 he would have never made it.

There are many testimonies that I have listened to now, and much material that I had seen, that people would say that they were released, and even Magda, we were talking to Magda. She was saying how people were collected to a camp in Zagreb and they were released to go home and get their clothes or something, and it seems that while they were extremely cruel, within Jasenovac, that they were also very disorganized, and sometimes people would come and go and they were constantly sending people from one place to another. I believe that was the most amazing thing that I found in reading the Jasenovac material, to what extent people were constantly being moved from Radiska to Jasenovac to Lepoglava, spending times on trains going back and forth, sometimes being released. It\u2019s amazing, and we haven\u2019t quite figured out. Lucie and I are both very surprised, and we haven\u2019t quite figured out what 1s the basis of that except that we feel that there was not a total organization."

One of them was my mother\u2019s brother. He\u2019s the only one actually of the entire Deutsch family who survived. On my father\u2019s side of the family, a few siblings survived, half of them. And this uncle, my Uncle Bernard, who goes now by Dov and lives in Israel, he survived because he was prisoner of war. He remained \u2014 he was in the Yugoslav Army, and became prisoner \u2014 actually, Erne was also prisoner of war. They both were in the army. They became prisoners of war, and so survived. It was a much easier survival from what \u2014 I just spoke to Bernard very recently and he was telling me stories, how they basically lived the same way like the rest of the prisoners of war, and they were able to get packages and they were fed reasonably decently, et cetera, et cetera. So, the two of them returned. Both of them asked me to go with them, and I absolutely refused. When I think about, at the age of seven, I was totally aghast that I would go with these people whom I didn\u2019t know. And my Uncle Bernard, Dov, got married to another survivor, this survivor of the camps, to Estie (ph), she survived Auschwitz. They left Yugoslavia, and went to France, to the south of France, and then eventually to Israel where they still live. My other uncle, Erne, got remarried. His wife, Irma (ph), and daughter, Edita (ph), were killed. By the way, that\u2019s one of my really vivid memories \u2014 his daughter was at one point released from a concentration camp, and I remember her coming to my grandfather\u2019s house and being totally skin and bones, full of lice, and I remember that she looked weird, and they put tar on her head, and she just looked so crazy to me. And I was, obviously, a little girl, and again, she then continued to live in Ludbreg and not in total and absolute Anne Frank- style hiding, and then she was taken away again. But, anyway, she then was taken away and was killed. But he remarried, Erne remarried, and married a woman who became a widow and had two children, and they eventually left for Israel, and I remained behind. I think that from the date of the adoption \u2014 I was adopted by my uncle, and my brother also, almost immediately after the war in 46."

So, in my father\u2019s family, there were six children, and one sister and two brothers survived, and this one brother was in Bergen-Belsen and then was rescued out of Bergen-Belsen and went to Switzerland, and he married Magda, and they had one child a seven-year-old child or so when I heard from them. So, maybe he was \u2014 maybe he was about five, six at the time. So, it must have been, I think that child was born sort of \u00b045, \u00b046. So, I heard sort of into the \u201850s more or less continually from them, and remember very vividly getting a package from them, a ball point pen where you could see through the plastic.

My mother lived in Cakovec for a bit of time, and apparently learned Hungarian while she was there, just as a side thing. So, it was a big thing, you know. To study languages was very important, and I was always given all the opportunities, but, you know, I was given a lot of opportunities and I was aware of that because we lived surrounded by in this world of farms and farming families, and there were very few so-called \u201cintellectuals\u201d families in town, and you know, I was one of those, and I had more than most people, and I was made aware, you know, of, you know, noblesse oblige, and I had to behave well, and I was told I had to learn how to do things in the house, so that I can tell maids what to do, those kinds of things. So, I knew I sort of lived in sort of semi-privileged world, and I enjoyed it all. I liked to learn, and I, you know, there were books everywhere, and for fun I was reading Dante\u2019s Trilogy.

We only sold wood \u2014 there was a little forest and we could sell wood and gravel, and then there was stuff in the house that we were able to sell.

It\u2019s not that I feel closer to them than to my uncle, but the fact that I felt close to them was interesting to me. It\u2019s not that that\u2019s a comparison, but almost total strangers, and I remember that my uncle came to get me, Uncle Jozi, came to get me at the border. I was on the Orient Express and just coming through Simplon, and I was obviously nervous all by myself traveling, and he said he would come and meet me at the border in Brigg, and I\u2019m looking out the window, and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cHow am I going to recognize him?\u201d I had a picture; they sent me one. I had a picture, but how am I going to recognize him, and it was such a feeling when I saw him. I knew it \u2014 first of all, I knew that that was him, and I that was a really, very special feeling of some overwhelming emotional connection. And, of course, after, you know, later on when I went to live with them for a year, and studied in Switzerland, I realized they were really very good people, and they did \u2014 they did a lot to enable me to be there. And, of course, Stricek did, too, because it costs money for me to go. My relatives in Switzerland didn\u2019t have any, and I didn\u2019t even realize that. We all thought, you know, just like people who would think money grows on trees in America, well, you know, we all thought, \u201cThere\u2019s lots of money in Switzerland.\u201d Well, of course, they had very little. They had come from a concentration camp and they had nothing, and I lived better in many ways where I was. I was able to bring my aunt, as a present, a gold bracelet."
