So, at one point, I had the nickname Tea from Thea, but I don\u2019t remember being called that. Then, in Croatia, Dora is arather sort of, a name, a very folksy name used usually sort of used for old ladies, and that\u2019s not what I was ever called. I was called \u201cDorica\u201d as a child. So, if we go back now, I\u2019m still called Dorica, and at home, I often was also called \u201cDorek\u2019\u2019, and when I came here, I became \u201cDora\u2019\u2019, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s sticking to that one now."

So, it\u2019s very normal for someone from a Slavic country to use that, but it\u2019s really not \u2014 it sounds very strange, I think, in English. I know a young woman who lives here who\u2019s from Belgrade, and she\u2019s called Bekica, and it\u2019s Becky, and to me it\u2019s like sounds very strange.

            "question": "In Zagreb?",
            "answer": "I was born in Zagreb. I was born in Zagreb, apparently. I checked that about two years after my parents were married, and I lived there only the first two and a half, three years of my life. My mother was not originally Zagreb. My father\u2019s family lived in Zagreb, and that not for a very long time in history. I mean, they came, I think, when my father was already in his early teens or so. They came mostly from Bosnia. They were not however Sefardi. They had come there from, I think, elsewhere in Europe. And then came to live in Zagreb, and my father\u2019s family tended to be cantors. They were very \u2014 it was a very religious family, and they studied cantorial music and one of them, one of my uncles, Arnold, was actually a cantor and had studied very seriously. Another uncle, Joseph, also studied seriously. My father, I think, went to Ludbreg, to another little town, to \u2014 also to be a cantor at times, and met my mother. So, my mother\u2019s family was from a different town. They were from the town, a very small town called Ludbreg; it\u2019s further north from Zagreb on the Hungarian border, really very close to Hungary, but that town, in contrast to others, did not have a Hungarian population. I never learned Hungarian. My mother apparently did. My grandfather on my mother\u2019s side was the rabbi of that town, Ludbreg. There were some 30 plus Jewish families. I think about, according to some books that I\u2019ve seen, about 37 Jewish families. And my grandfather, I believe, was invited to come and be a rabbi there, and they came from Czechoslovakia, and he \u2014 he came from Bratislava already with his \u2014 with the family, and so I don\u2019t know exactly how old he was, but from what I gather, most of his writing, he did quite a bit of writing, published, was in German, though he did learn Croatian, spoke in Croatian, but I think all of his writing is in German. I have papers where he wrote by hand and you can see that. Though his publications are in Croatian \u2014 I have some of the stuff that he published mostly treaties on the Torah and so on, so I don\u2019t know exactly. I\u2019ve only been told all these This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection things, and I don\u2019t know really if he wrote in German and someone translated, or whether he wrote directly in Croatian."

I\u2019m sorry, they had three daughters and a son, four children. The oldest \u2014 the oldest daughter was Giza, then Blanka, and then Silva, and the son was Erne."

            "answer": "Giza plays an important role in my life. Well, Blanka does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of together. The family lived together. It was a small town. Giza was ten years, I\u2019m sorry, fifteen years older than my mother. So, she often was sort of active as my mother\u2019s mother in they \u2014 I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the seashore. The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters \u2014 Zdenka and Vera. Their name was Appler, and the youngest \u2014 the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a school in Cakovec which is another small town, much larger town actually than Ludbreg, much closer even to the Hungarian border, and she went there to a teacher\u2019s \u2014 a teacher\u2019s school, became an elementary school teacher. The middle sister who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to Ludbreg, opened a store, and that\u2019s \u2014 and that\u2019s where they had two children. The oldest of the three, Giza, worked in the bank, in the Ludbreg Bank, and there she met a person who was to play a large part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic. Ljudevit is actually his real name. Ill get back to him. The brother Erne worked in Zagreb, worked early in Zagreb, and I\u2019m not exactly sure what he did there. I think clerical work of some sort. I\u2019m not sure of what he did. And the \u2014 my mother eventually finished the teacher\u2019s school and worked as a teacher in a small village near Ludbreg for a short period of time. Then my father and she met and married and left to live in Zagreb, and that\u2019s how I happened to have been born in Zagreb."

            "question": "Images?",
            "answer": "Yes, I have in my head an image of my mother, but it\u2019s very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have. And so it\u2019s very difficult because I\u2019ve seen those pictures all my life. It\u2019s very difficult to really distinguish what\u2019s memory and what\u2019s a photograph that you have in your head. So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can\u2019t really tell you whether I do or don\u2019t. I think I have an image of myself leaving on a train, because I left apparently when I was three years old. I left Zagreb with friends of my grandparents and went to Ludbreg, and that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand. And, again, I don\u2019t have any idea whether \u2014 because people often ask me whether I remember whether I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what\u2019s going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already \u2014 my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I \u2014 whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby? I have no \u2014 no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity. These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don\u2019t remember being tearful or I don\u2019t remember the farewell. I don\u2019t remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents. I don\u2019t remember any farewells. I remember sort of being on the train and there being fun."

If I had known nothing of that, and all of a sudden as an adult it came upon me, yes, of course, 1t would have been difficult. But I grew up with all of that. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s just part and parcel of my growing up.

I remember at Pesach, or before Pesach. I remember that they were burying silverware, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that\u2019s apparently what can be done. I found that much later. I had no idea of that. I remember my grandfather sitting in the garden with all of us playing around and he used to \u2014 he used to have his little table in front. This was, mind you, we were living in the house that was attached to the synagogue, and it was also \u2014 and everything \u2014 all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there. So, there was also the school and there were some kind of classrooms, and, of course, that was there much later. It\u2019s been destroyed now, but \u2014 so, he would sit in the garden with the little table and he had little piles of money in front of him and there were beggars that were sort of like professional beggars in that town, and they would come Wednesdays and Saturdays because those were market days in Ludbreg, and on Saturdays, of course, he wouldn\u2019t do that, but \u2014 that\u2019s Shabbat, but on Wednesdays they would sit and they would come and take their little piles."

Ludbreg is sort of like the county seat, and there were many surrounding villages, and those villages did not have either their own Jewish anything, nor did they have even middle schools. For example, later on when I went to middle school, people, kids from those villages would come to school, and that was also the place where market that was happening, and any kind of official papers were held and so on and so forth. So, it was sort of a \u2014 basically like a county seat. So, anyway, back to the images of my grandfather. Those are the images that I have my grandparents, but of course-"

There were lists, and they, you know, the Ustashe came to Ludbreg and, they \u2014 people were being rounded up.

Perhaps, again, they told me, but I didn\u2019t understand what they were telling me. But, as I mentioned, my Aunt Blanka and her family lived next door to Aunt Giza and Ludjevit, and basically I remember at one point people coming and we were all in one room and they came with satchels or small suitcases in their hands and pillows under their arms and saying goodbye and leaving. And I didn\u2019t know exactly what was going on and why were they leaving and who was crying, and I was sad because these were my cousins, but that\u2019s the image that I have in my head of their leaving. And I had the sense that it was, there was something that was dangerous and bad and that people were being taken away. I don\u2019t have the image of my grandparents leaving. I don\u2019t remember that. I remember my cousins. I know that my grandparents were taken at the same time."

And then there was a proclamation by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who had left, should return, and if they return they will be spared, nothing will happen to them, and they stupidly returned. I have a very good friend of mine who still lives in Zagreb now. Her family, which was another family in Ludbreg left also, and had left before this proclamation and they cleverly did not return. They were the only Jewish family, in fact, that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return, actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning, and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisan- held territory in Kordun. But, people who returned believing that this was going, you know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone."

I have a feeling that I was not on the list. I had seen one of those lists.

That\u2019s a possibility. But the other thing is that I know that many times we were warned that there would be a raid, and perhaps I \u2014 if they had been warned, they would have hidden someplace, but I always wondered why in the world were they sitting there?

I was like, \u201cWhy were you there?\u201d You know, it\u2019s very hard for me to understand. It\u2019s not hard to understand why they didn\u2019t \u2014 why in some places there was no place to go, but I think in Ludbreg, one of the things about Ludbreg, it was a town that was very close to the \u2014 to where the Partisans where. It\u2019s at the foot of the mountains, and of course, it was very difficult and Partisans had a very difficult life, but for those of us who were so vulnerable, why we didn\u2019t you go someplace into a small village or smaller village. I mean, this was small, but it wasn\u2019t really small, not by Croatian standards. Why we stayed there, I don\u2019t know. Faith that we would not be wanted? Or something? I don\u2019t really know. But I know that often with my Aunt Giza, we would \u2014 we would go places. I remember one time going to Varazdin, which 1s a larger town nearby, and staying with a relative, and I think this was the time that I understood that it was dangerous to stay and that we had to hide for a few days. The other \u2014all the other hiding that I did was sort of nearby with \u2014 mostly with friends, and there were a number of families. There was the Ziza, the Runjak family, my brother and I would spend some time with, especially Ludbreg \u2014 Ludbreg experienced a lot of fighting. We were really not so much in a concentration camp kind of situation. We were in a war \u2014 we were in a war zone. So, when it was \u2014 when it was time to hide because the Ustashe took town, then I spent, for example, time with this Runjak family, and they had rented from this other house which was now empty. They had rented that apartment, and we stayed with them. And I called Mrs. Runjak \u201cMother\u201d when I knew that it was dangerous, and I understood at that point what was dangerous, and my brother called her \u201cMother\u201d all the time because he wouldn\u2019t know how to distinguish from when it was dangerous and when it wasn\u2019t. So, I lived with them, and they had three teenage children, and it\u2019s thoroughly amazing because I remember Ustashe making camp in our backyard, and we were there, and just pretending that we were part of this other family. And it\u2019s amazing sometimes because the whole town essentially knew who we were. That\u2019s the most amazing part of all. In a small town like that, everybody knew that we were the rabbi\u2019s grandchildren, and at no point did anybody say, \u201cWhat about these kids?\u201d"

So, but, anyway, our bad experiences during the war really had to do with the fighting, which everybody experienced, not just the Jews.

And the reason it\u2019s called that 1s because the members of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives. They killed themselves at the end of the battle in a house that was down my street because they were totally surrounded. They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn\u2019t want to be captured. But there were fights and we would spend \u2014 we spent a lot of time in the basement. We had a cellar, not a basement in an American sense. It was a cellar. We had a vineyard, and we had wine, and there were big barrels down there, and shelves and shelves full of apples that were there for the winter. And at one point, we had beds down there, rollaway beds. And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting. Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and \u2014 not forget \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, we didn\u2019t know that we should go down there on time. So, then if a fight \u2014 if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the house to get \u2014 to go into the cellar, and so it was too dangerous already to do that.

There were \u2014 the Ustashe would take people who were thought to be sympathizers of the Partisans, which they were, many of them, and if they \u2014 sometimes they would catch them, some of them were sent to concentration camp and that includes my uncle, but my uncle who eventually married my aunt and he wasn\u2019t Jewish. I didn\u2019t explain that part, but at any rate, he ended up in concentration camp at one point in Jasenovac, and they would take them either to camp and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just in town, and I do have a very vivid image of going with one of our cleaning ladies to the main square and I wasn\u2019t supposed to see it. She was holding her hand on my eyes, but I saw it. There was a body hanging on every one of the trees around the square, and I remember people saying \u2014 they were \u2014 because they were Partisans, that\u2019s why."

They were well educated and very old Croatian family. They count their ancestors to something like the 12\" century where there were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection two famous Vrancic people. There was the Cardinal, and then there was an inventor, a fairly famous inventor by that name, and then the mother\u2019s family was called Svagel, and they were nobility, minor nobility, nevertheless, they had the PL, which 1s the approval of a in their name, and the silver has that and so on. And they established themselves in this town, and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who remarried. They all died fairly young, not the children necessarily, some yes, but fairly \u2014 sort of as teenagers or young people, and as my memory goes, there were only two survivors and they were already in their fairly old age. One of them was Vika and the other was Ludva, and Vika remained single and died in the middle of the war, and I remember her quite well. Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that town. He was \u2014 he had been a mayor. He was a organizer of the sports club. He was the organizer of \u2014 he was the head of the soccer club even though he never played soccer. He organized everything in that town. He was especially having to do with music. He loved music. He played the violin. He organized two different kinds of orchestras. He was the heart of that town in terms of any kind of cultural life. When he fell in love with my aunt, and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catholic family, and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi, not exactly the right combination for the times, forever, but certainly not for that time. And he was ten years older than she, and they knew each other especially from the bank because he was a director of a part of another bank, and she worked there. And, again, I know that only from stories. I asked him many times afterwards, \u201cSo, why didn\u2019t you get married for such a long time?\u201d Because they got married in 1937, I think, or 1939, I\u2019m not too sure. I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me, \u201cWell, she was very happy living with her family, with her parents, and I was fine living with my sister and my mother. There was no need to get married.\u201d Well, I rather doubted that was how it was, but that\u2019s how he always said it. But I\u2019m sure that my grandparents did not \u2014 were not thrilled their daughter going with a Catholic person. However, in all the pictures of the family for a very long time, he\u2019s always present. So, it wasn\u2019t like he wasn\u2019t accepted totally, and I think by the time the war was imminent in Europe, and they knew what was happening, they decided to get married. So, they got married. They actually had to go to Hungary to get married because you couldn\u2019t get married in a civil ceremony in Croatia or Yugoslavia, that is, and neither of them was converting to anything. So, they got married in a civil ceremony. So, the house that we basically had lived was the Vrancic house, and then they and my other aunt, the Appler family, decided to build a house of their own, but it was within the same compound, the same land base. So, that\u2019s how we ended up having these two houses that were next to one another, and the other one was supposed to be a big two-story house with a store on the bottom for my uncle, a small apartment in the back, which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there, and then there was supposed to be two apartments upstairs, and that never got finished, of course, before the war."

But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that house from then on, and that\u2019s, you know, I remember, that\u2019s \u2014 we were set then in that house from then on."

So, my father was there for also for quite awhile. He was taken with a number of other non-Jews from Ludbreg, and they were there, I can\u2019t remember for how long, but at least a year, I think, and I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve forgotten, but certainly I talked to him afterwards, but I don\u2019t have a good memory of how long he was there. But I do know all the stories he told me when he returned of how and why he survived, and basically they found out that \u2014 well, they knew \u2014 that he was a banker, and so they put him to work in an office in Jasenovac to balance their books, to work on the books, and so that he didn\u2019t have to be out in the rain and snow and people, there was one person in the office who was an Ustashe but not one of those \u2014 not one of those that went around killing people necessarily, and he was reasonably kind to him. In fact, after the war, I have definite memories of Stricek sending packages to him because later on, he was in jail, I mean, yeah, in jail for many years after the war. But this is so \u2014 the one thing that saved him was that. The other thing that saved him was that he was always, as I told you, an organizer of things cultural, and they wanted to have, the Ustashe wanted to have entertainment. So, he organized a chorus, and he collected anybody that he knew. So, there were some nieces of his \u2014 second niece because he didn\u2019t have brothers and sisters, cousins, two cousins\u2019 daughters were there \u2014 he collected all these people and they created a chorus. So, of course, he claimed to have to practice if they wanted to have a good performance. So, that saved them also from having to work so hard, and they\u2019d sometimes allow them access to some more food. He said my father, on the other hand, worked very hard. Nevertheless, my father survived until the very end."

I think that my \u2014 Stricek remembers my father working with bricks, and carrying stones and bricks and things, but he was much, much younger. Stricek at that point, he was born in 1885, he was old, and he had this family of people who were dying with weak lungs at a moment\u2019s notice, and he was \u2014 he would have never made it.

There are many testimonies that I have listened to now, and much material that I had seen, that people would say that they were released, and even Magda, we were talking to Magda. She was saying how people were collected to a camp in Zagreb and they were released to go home and get their clothes or something, and it seems that while they were extremely cruel, within Jasenovac, that they were also very disorganized, and sometimes people would come and go and they were constantly sending people from one place to another. I believe that was the most amazing thing that I found in reading the Jasenovac material, to what extent people were constantly being moved from Radiska to Jasenovac to Lepoglava, spending times on trains going back and forth, sometimes being released. It\u2019s amazing, and we haven\u2019t quite figured out. Lucie and I are both very surprised, and we haven\u2019t quite figured out what 1s the basis of that except that we feel that there was not a total organization."

So, it\u2019s interesting because one of the things that this Mrs. Winters says, she says, \u201cAll the good things...\u201d\u2019, she was, by the way, very famous, a very well-known person in the Partisans during the war, and she considered herself a historian, and I am sorry, very sorry that she died before I could talk to her because she writes very nice things including about him, including the fact that he adopted me and my brother after the war, and then she says things like, in one sentence she says that even that was not, that he lost so much during the war, and then in the end he even lost me because I married this in quotes: \u201crich Jew\u201d, which made me just wrinkle because my husband was anything but rich, and that I left and left him there, which of course wasn\u2019t the case. Yes, I left, but very much with his \u2014 with his approval, and he knew he was quite elderly and he knew that he wanted me to have as good a life as I possibly could.

So, that is how I end up having a lot of my grandfather\u2019s books, not my grandfather\u2019s, but the synagogue\u2019s books, some of my grandfather\u2019s books. So, they were all stored there.

One of them was my mother\u2019s brother. He\u2019s the only one actually of the entire Deutsch family who survived. On my father\u2019s side of the family, a few siblings survived, half of them. And this uncle, my Uncle Bernard, who goes now by Dov and lives in Israel, he survived because he was prisoner of war. He remained \u2014 he was in the Yugoslav Army, and became prisoner \u2014 actually, Erne was also prisoner of war. They both were in the army. They became prisoners of war, and so survived. It was a much easier survival from what \u2014 I just spoke to Bernard very recently and he was telling me stories, how they basically lived the same way like the rest of the prisoners of war, and they were able to get packages and they were fed reasonably decently, et cetera, et cetera. So, the two of them returned. Both of them asked me to go with them, and I absolutely refused. When I think about, at the age of seven, I was totally aghast that I would go with these people whom I didn\u2019t know. And my Uncle Bernard, Dov, got married to another survivor, this survivor of the camps, to Estie (ph), she survived Auschwitz. They left Yugoslavia, and went to France, to the south of France, and then eventually to Israel where they still live. My other uncle, Erne, got remarried. His wife, Irma (ph), and daughter, Edita (ph), were killed. By the way, that\u2019s one of my really vivid memories \u2014 his daughter was at one point released from a concentration camp, and I remember her coming to my grandfather\u2019s house and being totally skin and bones, full of lice, and I remember that she looked weird, and they put tar on her head, and she just looked so crazy to me. And I was, obviously, a little girl, and again, she then continued to live in Ludbreg and not in total and absolute Anne Frank- style hiding, and then she was taken away again. But, anyway, she then was taken away and was killed. But he remarried, Erne remarried, and married a woman who became a widow and had two children, and they eventually left for Israel, and I remained behind. I think that from the date of the adoption \u2014 I was adopted by my uncle, and my brother also, almost immediately after the war in 46."

So, maybe he was \u2014 maybe he was about five, six at the time. So, it must have been, I think that child was born sort of \u00b045, \u00b046.

We had just emerged, sort of, from really, not having anything in the stores, and you know, we had emerged from the time that we were getting UNRRA packages, you know, and with crazy foods from America, and my memory of that is all of the foods that we couldn\u2019t eat like \u2014 that we didn\u2019t like, like canned orange juice, and there were some clothes that we got, and I got a sweater from school, because there was piles of things, and I brought home this sweater, and my uncle made me take it back, because we weren\u2019t as poor as other people who could have this sweater.
