Because he was a teacher and a\npedagogue, but I was asking myself why did the clever Jews need this German Jew to\nhelp them to build the school? | Youdon'tknow.  Soused to be called Travis (ph).\nQ There were, from what I understand, there were several Jewish schools in Kaunas,\nin Kovno?\nA Lialu (ph) was right behind the opera. __I was one of the reputable contest today\nKerados mindovas (ph).

In contrary, the old orthodox Jews speak Yiddish. Because\nHebrew is a holy language and you don't use the holy language for every day.\nQ That's exactly why, it is a holy language. That's why we think it is religious.\nA No, for them.\nQ I see.\nA It was Lithuanian Jew. What we called a Lithrock (ph). His name\nwas Aliaza Benny Huda (ph).

Even in the concentration camp, at the worst of conditions, when people\nlost signs of humanity, she was like -- she was like helping everybody. Doing\neverything. I believe she used the term, it has been so many years since she said it, she\nwas like -- like somebody, like an angel. That says something for a person.\nQ That's right.

They\nmoved. They built it and then the second one was in Beirut and he used to meet\nwith the Palestinian at that time partners, who came to him and he used to treat and buy\nthe wood from there and then send some of it to Achor and part of it to communist. So he\nwent --\nQ He was on the road a lot?\nA He was on the road.\nQ Was he distant?\nA I still remember -- remember that. I remember him distant. | You know, there\nwas a cafe in Calmuth (ph). Have you ever heard of Monica (ph)?\nQ No.\nA It was a very famous cafe, on Lisadown (ph) and afternoon the men used to -- I'll\nshow you a picture.

You know what Stanova (ph) 1s?\nStanova 1s -- there was a Russian word that was used in and among the Lithuanians and I\nused to lie next to him and he used to tell me little stories. Most of the stories he\nrepeated. I knew it already by heart. But the story, like, for the mitelda (ph)\nmysitatelga (ph), which means, I'll tell you a story with a white goat, the schetzliata (ph)\nand mitsushaka (ph). So, this was very good. You could tell it, but I always listen to it\nand the whole story about the goat and the sheep, the schetzliata sheep. She is red\nand so there is a fourth little stories. But, Monica stories, and traveling. He\ndidn't go to the summer house. \u2014 He used to come only on weekends.\nQ He worked? He worked?\nA He worked all through the summer.\nQ Were your parents happy together? Was it a good couple? A good\nmarriage?\nA I think it was good.\nQ Yeah.\nA But then something bad happened, that one day he missed -- he missed the bus or\nthe train and he jumped to check on the car and the car turned over and he was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 33\ninjured. And we got a shock and laid in a hospital for a year.\nQ Wow. How old were you?\nA He never -- he never came back. Three and five.Q How old were you when\nthat happened?\nA Ten. It was on the eve of Passover and see then eve of Passover the Russians\nshut down was a New Year. He always come home, but when such a thing -- today they\ndon't men -- they can't skip. Lithuanians it was a holiday. It wasn't a religious\nfamily. It was a religional family. It definitely wasn't a religious.\nThe school was not a religious. They didn't even taught us how to pray. This was\nanti-religious I would say in away.\nQ Really. Yeah.\nA They wanted a new product, the modern Jew. Another settled Jew. They created\nthe new Jew. This new Jew existed many years. This was when he was very rich and he\nbecame babahelshoa (ph) or rothchild or what the feuher (ph) or whatever, but novawent\n(ph) it was a schetel (ph) and schetel was odo (ph). The schetel was very progressive\nin away that instead of you following that mystical organization. If I was to go to\nLithuania I will buy for you the book that Gustadtz (ph) did.\nQ Okay.\nA When you read the book you understand everything.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n24\nQ Okay. I want to ask a few other questions that are before the war and then we\ncome to those -- all those other events. In your family circle and in the people that you\nknew, did you have any friends who were not Jews? Was your world self-contained?\nWas it a Jewish world or was it one that was mixed?\nA That's a political, yes.\nQ Yes, it 1s. But it is also a social question. _ It 1s trying to get a sense of how\nclosed were societies? How closed were communities? How open were communities?\nHow much did people know about one another?\nA No, no non-Jewish friends.\nQ No non-Jewish friends.\nA It's not only that, the Jews lived in Lithuania, not like in Germany. In Germany,\na Jew was not a Jew. He was only believed in the religion of Moses. But mainly he was a\nGerman. Wherein Lithuania and Poland, no. Mostly in Lithuania. Lithuania is\nvery classic forit. It 1s a society -- a Jewish society which doesn't mingle with the\nunJews. I mean, when the children, of course, the grown-ups used to make business\nfriends. But I didn't have any non-Jewish friends. I had no Jewish friends when we\nwent to Palanga, not Kretinga, Palanga because there were no other Jews. We are the\nonly family, maybe another one. And there it was -- I was -- I played there, but as friends,\nI cannot recall anybody that I kept on a relationship with him later on.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 35\nAnother way this happened, it is abnormal in away, but I don't -- I don't know, for\nexample, Jewish children in another kadanzing (ph). What I know is my class. That's\nall. \u00a9 Wewere friends. Later on, when we went to the university it was different.\nUniversity was another program under misbasis (ph) but no, we lived in Autersak (ph),\nthe three recos (ph) which is vis-a-vis the Paluno (ph).\nQ Can you repeat the name of the address again?\nA Autersak.\nQ Autersak, No. 13. Youlived there? That's a lovely place to live.\nA It was a lovely place.\nQ It is a very nice place, yeah.\nA If you go out of the door --\nQ I'll spell it.\nA -- and you see --\nQ It is townhouse square.\nA -- with catali and --\nQ Catali, it is a kind of tree.\nA But it is in a house I lived other Jewish people.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n26\nQ Would you say then, you've mentioned her once before, you said that there was a\nmaid who lived in your family. | A maid who lived in your family. Was she the only\nperson who was non-Jewish that you interacted with in a regular way? Yes?\nA She was everything to me. She was a maid. She was a nanny, but something\nhappened to her. She became pregnant. And Teresa was born. Her name\nwas Vinsa (ph).\nQ Vinsa.\nA Teresa was born and my mother said -- I mean, the husband was not known. I\nknew the husband, because they used to sneak in the remainder of the house and I\nunderstood there was something going on. Vinsa was very good to us. We loved her,\nespecially my brother. And my father said, take Teresa and go to Pusucamas (ph). You\nknow where Pusucamas? You don't know where that is. Pusucamas is when you right\non Scadniop (ph) now you know.\nQ Okay. Yosweneuronos (ph). We'll look at this later. So she had to leave\nyour family?\nA No, she says I cannot go back. __ It is illegitimate child. They will tear me to\npieces. We are a very strict catholic family. We don't want it. |\u00a7 And my mother felt\nand my father, let her stay with us. Teresa will grow up together with our children\nand this is what happened. But the mean children at school used to say how is Teresa\ntoday. It was another thing. They came to see Teresa. She was crawling all over the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 57\nplace. Made my father nervous. But my mother understood the situation. Wonderful.\nShe was born in Ricoholen (ph), in the Jewish hospital or in the private hospital it is\nmuch more money.\nQ Yeah.\nA And this is a tiger I'm telling you.\nQ Yeah.\nA Why, you will understand ina minute. Look, she was to go with us for a walk\nwith us children. She was very religious. So, you know, the big cathedral in\nKaunas on Vilinus Venachos (ph) she used to take us there. We used to sit down and\nmake my lunch.\nQ Signs of the cross.\nA I mean, it is so similar because they say hallelujah. We all say hallelujah,\namen, of course. Amen is very -- we say 50 times, I mean, same thing as you say. But\none day when she came out of the thrufos (ph) just in the corner of Angos villios (ph) --\nQ And he was shot?\nA And he dared to do it. He was -- he was so nervous. I can -- I can\nremember it. When you asked what do you remember?I remember. And I was never -- I\nwas a church, very close to the Neuman (ph). She took us there, too, sometimes. She\nhad a brother, Ritas (ph).\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n28\nThe brother was Hussar. You know what the Hussar 1s?\nQ In the Czarist Army\u201d?\nA What?\nQ A Hussar in the Czarist Army?\nA No, they call it the Hussar in Lithuanian Army, too. There was a Calarasi.\nQ That's a soldier.\nA And a Hussar. He was -- it was like a commando unit.\nQ Okay.\nA Like my grandson is in the commando unit. It took -- he is a para trooper and\nup until 18 he was -- he was pin drop (ph) and the minute he got his matura, he\nwas enlisted and then he went to para trooper for nine months. Terrible. He went to\ntraining because the para trooper they are expected to be the Commander.\nQ All right. So Vitas was a Hussar?\nA Vitas was a Hussar. I don't know why I remember. Why do I make acknowledge\nbecause I have Vitas 1s he was like a general.\nQ Yeah.\nA He make me sworn. He see his niece. _ I used to wear his hat and I was in\nheaven.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 29\nQ In heaven, yeah.\nA He came and then I think -- but they never went anywhere. They always sat in\nthe kitchen. It was -- there was things that belonged to classes that you don't go do that.\nQ You don't mix in those ways.\nA We, of course, he used to eat at the commons to stay and he had those sports, you\nknow, and you are right, your memories 1s beautiful. I look at that uniform nothing can\ncompare. Okay. But we are not to play with our soldiers, but defending. I'm so\nhappy now when I remember Vitas.\nQ Okay.\nA Yes, but -- but what happened later. Can we go on?\nQ Absolutely if you want to say something please do.\nA No. I mean, she was a second mother. And my little brother she was\neverything for him. When we were shipped to the Ghetto, she wanted to take him. She\nsays, I'll save his life. It was clear what was going on. And my mother said, no,\nwhatever will be with us will be with him. She took Teresa. She went to the village.\nShe crawled through the holes and the ragging and a lot of food and she helped us to\ngoing into the Ghetto.\nQ So you are talking now about the time when you -- all the Jews of Kaunas were\nordered to go into the Ghetto in the summer of 1941, yeah?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n30\nA Iremember there. And that's it. And there is no more Vinsa. No more\nTeresa. There was a Ghetto. This will talk later, but in '95,'91 when Lithuania\nbecame independent, and my brother started to nudge me, I said, Dani, forget about tt.\nI'm not going there. I don't want to see it. I don't want to go to Lithuania. __ Forget\nit. He said, no, no, no, Vinsa is still alive. I want to see her.\nQ Was she?\nA No. So we went. We went. We came to Kaunas. It wasn't excitement.\nQ It was what?\nA Excitement. Such an extended. We landed in Vilinus. We come to Kaunas\nand the very same night, that night we were running around into town because we knew\neach and every street and it was like coming home in away And then I said to the guy,\nthey hada guide. __I[ said to the guide, do you know Pitsupukamos (ph)? He said, no.\nBut I look at the map at 12 o'clock and I know where itis. | Wecan go\nourselves. | We went and seen it. We sent Sanby (ph). It is a Pitsupukamos and\nwe came and there was a man was working in the fields. I said to\nhim, do you know Vinsa Bayono Skita?\nQ What was her name, Bayono Skita?\nA Of course, she was not married.\nQ Right.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n31\nA This is really unfair. Why should they -- unmarried, okay, they have a present.\nShe is unmarried. And I did ask him where do you know Vinsa Bayona Skita? He\nsaid, she is dead, but her daughter Teresa she lives here. Maybe they meet us. So the guy\ngoes in and says, do you know Uri and Dani Chanoch? They my brothers. They killed\neveryone. Started to cry. Because Teresa was already attached. She lived\nonly on the memories, on the stories that her mother told her because they don't hold no\ninterest for them. They was in Cohost (ph), the Russians and the times that they\nstay with the Cohost, this is the golden age. My mother never checked out with money,\ntake money and buy this, buy this. Ladies who checked out how much and then she\ncomes out and she sees us and she started to shout and to cry, are you alive? It was no\nconnection in those times. Only once I sent her an invitation when I marry Judy and she\nwas kept in captivity because Israel was --\nQ Enemy country, right.\nA And we have it on the video.\nQ You have it on video. This meeting?\nA My sister, no. Visit to her brother. My visit to her. My sister-in-law took a\nphoto, a camera and made 200 hours, 200 hours we made -- we made a movie, a movie.\nQ Oh, my gosh.\nA It is very, very -- I would a say very unique film.\nQ I would think.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n32\nA In spite of the thing that she was the professional or maybe because she was the\nprofessional.\nQ Is Teresa still alive?\nA No, she died a year ago. But I contacted her. We had like family. And I'm also\nwith her two daughters in touch. Teresa and Vinsa came back and Vinsa became the\nhead of the village.\nQ She became the head of the village, that's amazing.\nA Why don't you ask why\u201d?\nQ Well, why\u201d?\nA Because the Germans needed food. So they went to the kymas (ph).\nQ To the villages, yes.\nA And they confiscated.\nQ Yes.\nA You had five pigs, they took the five pigs, but then they came to visit Kymas,\nTeresa came over and spoke to them in Yiddish. They understood. They said in\nYiddish, don't take all the five pigs. Take two pigs. Leave us all something. She\ncommunicated. Nobody could communicate. Nobody spoke Yiddish in Bucykamas (ph),\nand she was very honored.\nQ In spite of the fact that she had an illegitimate?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n33\nA In spite of the fact that it was already the Russian period, the religion was not\nanymore a dominant factor.I was really -- I was starting the story, I said, look something\ngood came out of it.\nQ Yeah.\nA Vinsa died from cancer five years before.\nQ In 1990, if you went in '95.\nA Yeah, in 1990 she died. \u2014 She had her grave and a tombstone is like a queen. She\n-- and Teresa had two daughters Jolanta and Rasa.\nQ Jolanta and Rasa.\nA Yes.\nQ So J-o-l-a-n-t-a and R-a-s-a.\nA She also had a boy. I think, maybe it was Selima (ph) or something like this. They\nboth -- they both died by accident or by cars or by -- I don't know. They were drinking\ntoomuch. \u2018This 1s a sickness there in Lithuania.\nQ Oh, yeah, huge. It is huge.\nA The drinking and I don't know what kind of a living Teresa made, a poor living,\nbut she was happy. When I make you understand because I used to come very often to\nLithuania, I tried to, to get some community property back, and there one day I came\nwith one of our ministers and we were sitting next to the opera and the mystic garden.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 34\nQ Oh, yeah.\nA And we were having lunch and she said, I wish Stalin would come back.\nQ Oh, yeah.\nA So at least I had -- I went to Dachau. I had enough to eat. What they did to us\ntoday, they gave us, okay, I supported it. It is not.\nQ I know of that sentiment. I have heard it as well.\nA Yes.\nQ Yes.\nA Then it was very shocking. All of this said, look. Life was organized. Okay. That was\na lot of stating and a lot of negative things and so on, so forth and encapida (ph).\nQ Encapida is secret police.\nA The secret police. I brought Teresa to Israel.\nQ Oh, wo w.\nA Fortw  oweeks. One week with my brother and one\nweek withus.\nQ Wow.\nA She was ex-Cinderella in Wonderland. You been there I would presume.\nQ No. I want to.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n35\nA You understand me much better than you come, of course, and get in touch with\nme.\nQ Yes.\nA I'll spend the day with you in Jerusalem and you will never forget it.\nQ I'dlove it. I'd love it.\nA And now she is very religious. =I took her to Wailing Wall. I said you Pontius\nPilate and then here we are recohomo (ph) and here first station and the second station\nand she doesn't react. She doesn't try to include. She had no idea what the first\nstation, second station, a cross is a cross, whenever she have a cross she hugged them and\nkissed them.\nQ But she had never gotten religious education?\nA No.\nQ Yeah.\nA But, you know, there is Jesus and wise men by the things that Jews and this is it.\nSo I saw there was no use, no explaining about the Holy Sepulcher.\nQ What are the stations of the cross, in other words?\nA Separate cross.\nQ No, that is an irony. If you were to explain to her what the stations of the cross and\nshe hadn't known what it was before. When you saw them, when you went to Lithuania\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection a6\nthe first time and this 1s a question I would really like to ask at the very end. Did\nsomething change in you in 1995?\nA It was matter with me that change.\nQ Because before you didn't want to go. And then you went and then after that\nyou went more. So something must have changed?\nA There was more because I was asked to go. There is a different story. Ifyou\ngo back to the atrocities --\nQ We haven't even gotten there yet.\nA Yeah. It 1s -- you come back to a place where you were born and you like it.\nThe weather was good. It wasn't hot like here or anything, hot sometimes and\neverything was good. Every morning we used to go with a couple at the inn.\nQ To have some coffee.\nA And butter and the milk and the school and the Dutcha (ph). I mean, it wasn't a\nbig family. _ We were normal middle class family and every year we went to grandma's\nand this was the highlight of my life to go to the schitel (ph) and she came to pick us up\nfrom the train with the local kutcher (ph), with the local guy that had --\nQ A driver who had a carriage?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n317\nA Horse carriage and then for a week, the hostel was somehow connected. _It is\nall dangerous because most of the people love her and I would ask Canuzum (ph) with\nthe father there was a difference. It was fun because --\nQ Really.\nA -- because we did the dishes, went together with the Gila (ph) conquer the almost\nbecame as far as Turkey and there you saw the Karakash. Karakash are a Jewish sect\nthat believe only what 1s written with no interpretations. Maybe the other regions in\nthe Bavaria, this was after the expulsion from Spain they went to Turkey. And when\npeople saw the twitter this takes people.\nQ This 1s medieval history.\nA The situation could only improve. So they came, another couple of hundred people\nand followed the Karakash. So, therefore, in this schitel I have a Sephardic name,\nSephardic name. [tis Enoch, not asa firstname. Enoch 1s the grandson of Adam\nand Eve. The son of Cain, which is not a big thing. I think all of them, but --\nbut then you find German and you find durmichaven (ph) and donmeh, a lot of donmeh,\nwhich 1s a lot of selanikli not covered, not covered lot of. So, of course, Bita (ph)\nthat came over Exkalzaday (ph). The schitel was, but my sister didn't go. Her mother\ndidn't let her. The air is not good enough for a girl.\nQ The hygiene is not good enough.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection\n38\nA And we -- we used to fish and used to go to -- it was better than somehow, but this\nwas a pack problem between my mother and grandma, but between my father and\ngrandma and usually at the reunion for the schitel because many of them became\nPalestinians and went to Palestine and out of four generations I also think and they make\ngetting things together and mainly they speak about Sara-Leah because she was such a\ndominant personality and this Lila (ph), of course, was a dominant one.\nQ So your grandmother and your uncle. \u2014_I'm just saying that for the tape.\nA Sara-Leah, Sara-Leah, Sara-Leah. So why -- but my little daughter says one that\nwas here, she works in York and she -- [love my grandma. Please, she has the name\nGaila (ph) give her all my grandmother's name, Sara-Leah. So, you know, that everybody\ngoes to the admils (ph) the girls. This is compulsive. You have to. So she sits there at\nthe crematorium camp and they call it Auschwitz, you know, and they said that -- then\nthey said Trina, Gallia, Sara-Leah, both of them, two girls knew that's three girls actually.\nThis is a joke.\nQ Okay. So let's --\nA So we go back to \u2014\nQ We were -- I was asking -- do you need to change -- A You better ask me. I'll\ncarry you away In --\nEnd of File One\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection so\nBeginning File Two\nA: I can visualize it.\n",
