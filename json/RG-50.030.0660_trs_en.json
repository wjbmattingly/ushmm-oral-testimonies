A I double p. Q Ipp, okay. A The spelling some people don't like. Q And your father's first name? A The Hebrew name is Shraga. Q Shraga. A But they used to call him Feivel. 5 Q Feivel. A It comes from the Greek word fables and this has to do with the spark. Feivel is a spark. FEMALE: Guta (ph) means disbelief. Q Is it still on? Okay. We'll keep on going. A It comes from the Greek fables. It has to do with spark. That is what my father explained to me. Q Okay. What - do you remember the years that they were born, your mother and your father? We record this as family member names, so that we have everything accurate. A My mother was put in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. She was 50. All of this was in '44. Can figure it out. Q So it would be 1894. 1894 and your father? A My father. Q And your father? A My father. Q O h, that was your father, sorry. And your mother? 6 A My mother was 44 years old. Q In 1945? A '44. I don't know if it was '44 or '45. I don't know. I did not find any records for my sister and my mother but -- Q So you think? A -- but she was 44 and I thin k -- I think it was in -- I think it was in '45. Q So that means she was born in 1900 or 1901? A Yes. Q Okay. A But I don't know the date, the dates of the children, you know, because they all celebrated their birthday, the parents didn't, so -- Q Your bro ther Dani, yeah, when was he born? A He was born on the 2nd of February, '32. Q 1932. And his name was Daniel? A Daniel, brother Daniel. Q What was your -- where were you all born, in the same place, in the same town, the same village? A You mean the chi ldren? 7 Q Yes. A Kaunas. Q In Kaunas? A Kaunas. Q Kowno or Kaunas? A Kaunas. Q And your parents, were they from the city of Kovno? A My father was born in Zasliai. Q In Zasliai. I will spell that. A Which is very close to Kaisiadorys. You probably know where it is. Q And your mother? A My mother I think was born -- I don't know. It is written in a birth certificate. I think you have to do all, but she was born in Cogno (ph), but she spoke always a place which is called Remni. Q Remni? A Yes, have you eve r heard? Q No. But that might be the Yiddish name of the town or the village and sometimes these names \u0152 8 A I think there was a time that the Jews were accused of treason in the first war corroboration with the Germans. So the Russians did send them out of the Lithuania. I presume that you know it. Q A little bit, yeah. A So actually only after -- only when Lithuania became independent people started to come back. Q That's the 1918 independence. A Yes. So what happened was that some of the people, the Jewish didn't come back. They stayed in Russia and became communists. They had had enough or maybe not. But I know for sure that my family, my father's family, my grandmother and her three sons were expelled to Venice (ph). Venice was already out. I mean, this was a place that you could stay. Q What was your father's profession? A My father was a merchant. Q What did he sell? Did he have a store? A He was a specialist for a special brand of wood. Q Wood? A Yes. Q And that means? 9 A Messus (ph) wood. Q For? A Messus. Q Really. And was it an export business? A No, in the beginning in Kowno there was a messus factory by the name of Nor (ph). Q How do you spell that? A The Nor is also a spark in Hebrew. It is another Hebrew name and my father managed the factory. Q Nor (ph). A He managed the factory. It was the schlakerinis (ph). Q Oh, yeah, schlakerinis means green hill. A Green bough in Yiddish. Q V? A In Yiddish we used to say engrainbach (ph). Q Engrainbach, yea h. A And what they find out when they came to Palestine that this factory a branch of it in Achor in Israel. So, but when you getting married, it is not nice to be of familial 10 dress. Jewish trained their family to work for somebody. You ask for family busi ness for yourself and then always friendly cousin because she was the one who had the money and made the money, but you still read all the books. And when she had the three sons, she was so proud of them. One of my father, my father was the oldest. And the n one Abraham. Q Abraham? A Abraham stayed in the Zasliai and then Israel was the son that she loved very much and -- Q How did grandma make her money? A I think for hundreds of years we had a big piece of land in this land and people worked in the culture and there was ahead, although it was the reading, you know. So she had four or five girls. She was a very smart lady. Q What was her name? What was your grandmother's name? What was your grandmother's name? A The same name that my granddaughter -- my dau ghter has. Sara -Leah. Q Sara -Leah. Okay? A In Yiddish it was Sara -Leah. Q Sara -Leah. What was your -- what was the first language you spoke at home? 11 A This is a very interesting question. I remember Russian and I remember Yiddish. I remember Hebrew. I remember Lithuania. Q Four at once, four languages at once? A Yeah. It wasn't there. So as an infant, Yiddish, of course. Q But when you spoke to your parents, when you spoke with your brother and sister -- A I mainly spoke Yiddish to them, but for the maid I s poke Lithuania. I didn't speak any other language. Q To whom? A To the maid. Q To the maid. And you live -- you grew up in Kaunas even though the land w as in Zasliai, your family lived in the city? A I mean, Zasliai it was the province. The young people left the Schelak (ph) and went to universities, went to the big towns. Q Okay. A And this is what happened to my father and his brother Israel and the mid dle one stayed in Zasliai and had a shop with pots and all kinds of hardware or whateve r. Owned a market, vis -avis his mother. Grandma decided that we was capable to go and study and to be international. She said that the ropper (ph) was not capable because the star 12 was not my father or the youngest one Israel, he was all over the place and we make all the joke that if he did finish at least five danalos (ph). Q Yay. A From one to another one. Q So he was a professional student. A Yeah, he was a professional divernosa (ph). And he ended up in Klaipeda marrying a lady from a very noble family Zagenkan. They call it in Hebrew Sgah -Cohen. Q Can you repeat that again Zan \u0152 A Zagenkan. Q Zagenkan? A Olga Zagenkan and he settled there and they found a telephone book on Zamenhof Street. Q Zamenhof Street in Klaipeda, in the name of -- and was his name in there? Your uncle's name was it in there, in the telephone book? A Yes, yes, of course, otherwise I wouldn't know . Q Yeah. 13 A I mean, if a telephone is proof that you are a middle class family, so we all had a telephone until the end of the war. Q Yeah. Well, a car was a rarity in those days in that part of the world. A telephone was a rarity. Not everybody in the cou ntry had them. A A car, yes, a car, a car. I remember a classmate of mine was brought it was a Buick every morning. Q Wow. A So Palago Gater (ph), it was Palago Yimen (ph). Do you know the Behumas (ph) building in Kaunas? Q No, I have heard of it, but I don't know where it was located. A Something I got to think. Water. Q Can you remember what your earliest memories are? A Oh, yes. Q What were they? A I was informed that my brother was born. It was the 2nd of February. And my father - it was not in the Jewish hospital. It was not in the Kokoliem (ph). It was in the old part of the city. It was somewhere on Lisalia (ph). Q Lisalia is a boulevard of Liberty. 14 A In a private hospital. I don't know why he was a privilege. And then he took me with a shlitn and now in winter. Q Oh, with a sleigh? A With a sleigh, yes. And he wanted to give me and then we came. Came to see my mother and then they gave me a banana. Q In winter? A A thrill because you couldn't get bananas in winter. You have to get those -- so I wouldn't be hungry too much. Then he bought this little thing to show me. And I remember it is very, very clear. Q Yeah. A And I saw my mother lying in bed wit h the baby. We had a good time. Everybody was very nice to me. This I remember and then I remember, also, I was three years old and the maid of the house there was a little chain that we closed the door and I closed the door and I couldn't - Q She couldn't get back in? A And then the walls were very thick. So there was a window where it looked and I decided to go for a walk. Q On the windowsill? 15 A There was old people down there. And in Kaunas we was always like in the flat area now. You go in and there it was like this and like this. Q Inside a courtyard, in other words? A Yeah, and flat was in the courtyard. And my mother wasn't there and my father wasn't there. But they called the fire people. How do we say, omenagsir (ph)? Q That's right. The volunteer firefighters, yeah, or maybe they were just firefighters not volunteer. A They didn't call them firefighters. It is interesting that I don't know if you know it, all the firefighters in the Shetla (ph) and all the towners were Jewish. Q Really. A Yeah. Thank you very much. JUDY: Two glasses of water. Q Thank you. And so they got you, they rescued yo u from the windowsill? A Big litter and they told me to catch me they said don't be afraid. I wasn't afraid at all. They caught me at the last minute. Q How did you describe -- oh, did you want to say something? A I mean, this is a two seeds that I see now. I can write it. I cannot write anything else. I don't remember and I know that we went to the Palanga after that. You know where it is? 16 Q What Palanga? A Kretinga. Q Kretinga, yes, yes. A Kretinga was when you went off the ship. Q Okay. You didn't? A No. Q Okay. Hang on a second. A Because when you went down from the Palahok (ph), which is the steamshi p, you couldn't go to the left. You went Kretinga and to right you went to Palanga. Q Palanga, I don't know about Palanga. A Palanga was where Pranas Masiotas used to take his vacations. Q Pranas Masiotas, M -a-ci - M-a-s-i-o-t-as, okay. A It was -- it was a very famous writer. Q Yeah. A My mother went to Palanga. Why did my mother went to Palanga? Because she didn't want a Jewish lady to drink coffe e in Kretinga. She wanted to go barefoot. Q On the beach? 17 A In pharmos (ph). Q Yeah. A This was her sport. Q How -- how would you describe your family life? What kind of atmosphere was in your home when the three of you, you know, your oldest sister and the two boys and your parents, what kind of a feeling did you have there? A Very affable. Q Yeah. A Yeah. Very good life. They generated within the car and, I mean, I lived lu xury, not like things is today. But everything was in place. I mean, you knew stu ff. In my school you went into kindergarten and then to elementary school and you finished dacaturob (ph) and you could be accepted in any university in the world. It was very a high standard school. Q Tell us the name of your school? A Schlat (ph). They c alled it Lithuania Jew Gynamisum. Q Jewish high school gymnasium. But the name that you had for it, what would that be, Schwabis (ph), did you say Schwabis? A Yeah, the name. 18 Q I have heard of it, yes. I have heard of it. But I also heard that there was several? A Wyrobis (ph). Q Yeah, Wy (ph). A Because during the war, the first war the Germans were there and some of the officers and one of them was a culture officer was the name of Schwabe (ph) professor and later immigrated to Palestine and professor for that, but I came and asked him, please, help us to build a Hebrew high school. Because he was a teacher and a pedagogue, but I was asking myself why did the clever Jews need this German Jew to help them to build the school? You don't know. So used to be called Travis (ph). Q There were, from what I understand, there were several Jewish schools in Kaunas, in Kovno? A Lialu (ph) was right behind the opera. I was one of the reputable contest today Kerados mindovas (ph). And there was another one which was mixed Lithuanian Jewish and this was the big assimilation. Q What was the name of that school? A Yiddish Ilitusha (ph). Q Yiddish Ilitusha. Okay. 19 A Jewish Lithuanian School. Q Lithuanian? A And then there was a Cobert (ph) sc hool. Q And what about I have heard of Shola Ilahim (ph) school? A It was the Russians went to our school and gave it the name Shola Ilahim because everything turned into Yiddish. It was forbidden. Q I see. So -- A Serious. Q -- so the language of instruction in your school was Hebrew? A From the very beginning. Q Does that mean can I -- can I interpret from that that your family was very religious? A No. Q No. A How did you come to such a conclusion? Q How did I come to such a conclusion because when I hea r Hebrew I think of the Bible. A No way. 20 Q And I think of religion. A In contrary. In contrary, the old orthodox Jews speak Yiddish. Because Hebrew is a holy language and you don't use the holy language for every day. Q That's exactly why, it is a holy language. That's why we think it is religious. A No, for them. Q I see. A It was Lithuanian Jew. What we called a Lithrock (ph). His name was Aliaza Benny Huda (ph). He took the Bible and he built a new language and modern. It was suitable for every day life. So, of course, I can read all the religious books, but I can also read if I go to Cocoran (ph). Q Excuse us for a second. Okay. A The man, in a little bit, although they use table for book and in Kaunas we are very -- this writer was by the name of A vraham. Q Moppel (ph). I have heard of him. A The street, the Jewish street that is Moppel they met. I mean, it was when from the Yemen, the little country from the Gotgo (ph), before Gotgo got there, there was a Moppel Street. Q M'hum. 21 A He already wrot e in Hebrew language I think in 1700 the beginning of 1800 and he was a bitow (ph) because he wrote about the Bible, but then in a very romantic way for like the love of Cerone (ph) Matow (ph), which is a love story and so on, so forth. And there was Russians, therefore, was very honored. For example, he wrote a lot of for the job. It was never -- they used to go to Alexsutas (ph) there was a place. Q Alexsutas. A You know that? Q M'hum. A He used to sit down and write about, but he is not popular any more today. He was very popular in my days. Q Is Mrs. Chanoch are you from Lithuania? JUDY: Alexandria. My grandparents came to Palestine in 1924 from Russia. Q From Russia. JUDY: Poland. Q So I wanted to return to your family a little bit. Tell me about your father's personality. Your mother's personality. What were they like as people? What do you remember from them? A You have in your -- there was a lady who was, forgive me for many times, ten years ago I should give her -- I should give her the folder that I have. I have folders because my mother's sister did send it to me. It is a different story. I never knew 22 that I have relatives in America. I never knew that a grandfather from my mother's side broke it and he is buried there. I never knew. They neve r told me. It wasn't an issue. Because they was always in a depression. We had to help them. I don't know. I think that my mother was an excellent, like every mother, very loving, and very excellent mother. Q Extraordinary? A Very extraordinary, very wide heart. Q Was she a quiet person? Was she a person who was -- A She was -- she was everything. Everything positive was my mother. She was so good. Good. She was so loving. She was so caring. People came back from the concentration camp, we would -- they came to see me in Tel Aviv. Judy will tell you. She heard it. JUDY: His mother must have been a very special person. First of all, by the way, I always heard him talk about her, the way she risked her life to get some food because he was a growing boy. He was very hungry. He didn't complain, but she know he was so hungry. A I didn't complain. JUDY: And he can tell you that story how she risked her life to just -- and this woman who came to visit us said, I want to tell you something. Normally 20 mother -in -laws, you know, they are not so -- they don't have such a good reputation with the daughter -in -laws, but you would have missed out because Uri's mother was a very special person. Even in the concentration camp, at the worst of conditio ns, when people lost signs of humanity, she was like -- she was like helping everybody. Doing everything. I believe she used the term, it has been so many years since she said it, she was like -- like somebody, like an angel. That says something for a pers on. Q That's right. A reputation that lives beyond. JUDY: Yep. Q Were you closer to her than to your father, yeah? A Yes, I was. Q Okay. JUDY: I'm going to finish packing. Okay. Q Thank you very much. Bye -bye. Tell me a little bit about him. What was he l ike? So we go back. So we are talking about your father. And I wanted to know a little bit about what he was like as a person. A He was away. He used to travel a lot, buying wood and buying -- he used to fly every year to Romania, a very special place in Bucovina, Romania used to be what we call schelot (ph). I mean, the wood was just suitable 21 messus (ph) and there he used to meet because the second factory was in Palestine. They moved. They built it and then the second one was in Beirut and he used to meet with the Palestinian at that time partners, who came to him and he used to treat and buy the wood from there and then send some of it to Achor and part of it to communist. So he went - Q He was on the road a lot? A He wa s on the road. Q Was he distant? A I still remember -- remember that. I remember him distant. You know, there was a cafe in Calmuth (ph). Have you ever heard of Monica (ph)? Q No. A It was a very famous cafe, on Lisadown (ph) and afternoon the men used to -- I'll show you a picture. I had back -- maybe I might make you a cup of coffee. Look how the Yiddish people looked down in Kaunas. Like aunts and uros (ph). Q Yeah. A Trimisse (ph). It wasn't -- it was the best. This is much more resident of the east. Q Yeah. A And he used to take me with him. 22 Q To sit in the grand cafe in Monica? A In Monica. Get a piece of cake or milkshake or whatever and sit with his friends. And I read a selfi (ph) in Elistanova (ph). You know what Stanova (ph) is? Stanova is -- ther e was a Russian word that was used in and among the Lithuanians and I used to lie next to him and he used to tell me little stories. Most of the stories he repeated. I knew it already by heart. But the story, like, for the mitelda (ph) mysitatelga (ph), which means, I'll tell you a story with a white goat, the schetzliata (ph) and mitsushaka (ph). So, this was very good. You could tell it, but I always listen to it and the whole story about the goat and the sheep, the schetzliata sheep. She is red and so th ere is a fourth little stories. But, Monica stories, and traveling. He didn't go to the summer house. He used to come only on weekends. Q He worked? He worked? A He worked all through the summer. Q Were your parents happy together? Was it a good couple? A good marriage? A I think it was good. Q Yeah. A But then something bad happened, that one day he missed -- he missed the bus or the train and he jumped to check on the car and the car turned over and he was 23 injured. And we got a shock and laid in a hospital for a year. Q Wow. How old were you? A He never -- he never came back. Three and five. Q How old were you when that happened? A Ten. It was on the eve of Passover and see then eve of Passover the Russians shut down was a New Year. He always come home, but when such a thing -- today they don't men -- they can't skip. Lithuanians it was a holiday. It wasn't a religious family. It was a religional family. It definitely wasn't a religious. The school was not a religious. They didn't even taught us ho w to pray. This was anti -religious I would say in away. Q Really. Yeah. A They wanted a new product, the modern Jew. Another settled Jew. They created the new Jew. This new Jew existed many years. This was when he was very rich and he became babahelshoa (ph) or rothchild or what the feuher (ph) or whatever, but novawent (ph) it was a schetel (ph) and schetel was odo (ph). The schetel was very progressive in away that instead of you following that mystical organization. If I was to go to Lithuania I will buy for you the book that Gustadtz (ph) did. Q Okay. A When you read the book you understand everything. 24 Q Okay. I want to ask a few other questions that are before the war and then we come to those -- all those other events. In your family circle and in the people that you knew, did you have any friends who were not Jews? Was your world self -contained? Was it a Jewish world or was it one that was mixed? A That's a political, yes. Q Yes, it is. But it is also a social question. It is trying to get a sense of how closed were societies? How closed were communities? How open were communities? How much did people know about one another? A No, no non -Jewish friends. Q No non -Jewish friends. A It's not only that, the Jews lived in Lithuania, not like in Germany. I n Germany, a Jew was not a Jew. He was only believed in the religion of Moses. But mainly he was a German. Wherein Lithuania and Poland, no. Mostly in Lithuania. Lithuania is very classic for it. It is a society -- a Jewish society which doesn't mingle with the unJews. I mean, when the children, of course, the grown -ups used to make business friends. But I didn't have any non -Jewish friends. I had no Jewish friends when we went to Palanga, not Kretinga, Palanga because there were no other Jews. We are the only family, maybe another one. And there it was -- I was -- I played there, but as friends, I cannot recall anybody that I kept on a relationship with him later on. 25 Another way this happened, it is abnormal in away, but I don't -- I don't know, for example , Jewish children in another kadanzing (ph). What I know is my class. That's all. We were friends. Later on, when we went to the university it was different. University was another program under misbasis (ph) but no, we lived in Autersak (ph), the three recos (ph) which is vis -avis the Paluno (ph). Q Can you repeat the name of the address again? A Autersak. Q Autersak, No. 13. You lived there? That's a lovely place to live. A It was a lovely place. Q It is a very nice place, yeah. A If you go out of the door -- Q I'll spell it. A -- and you see -- Q It is townhouse square. A -- with catali and -- Q Catali, it is a kind of tree. A But it is in a house I lived other Jewish people. 26 Q Would you say then, you've mentioned her once before, you said that there was a maid who lived in your family. A maid who lived in your family. Was she the only person who was non -Jewish that you interacted with in a regular way? Yes? A She was everything to me. She was a maid. She was a nanny, but something happened to her. She became pregnant. And Teresa was born. Her name was Vinsa (ph). Q Vinsa. A Teresa was born and my mother said -- I mean, the husband was not known. I knew the husband, because they used to sneak in the remainder of the house and I understoo d there was so mething going on. Vinsa was very good to us. We loved her, especially my brother. And my father said, take Teresa and go to Pusucamas (ph). You know where Pusucamas? You don't know where that is. Pusucamas is when you right on Scadniop (ph) now you know. Q Okay. Yosweneuronos (ph). We'll look at this later. So she had to leave your family? A No, she says I cannot go back. It is illegitimate child. They will tear me to pieces. We are a very strict catholic family. We don't want it. And my mother felt and my father, let her stay with us. Teresa will grow up together with our children and this is what happened. But the mean children at school used to say how is Teresa today. It was another thing. They came to see Teresa. She was crawling all over the 27 place. Ma de my father nervous. But my mother understood the situation. Wonderful. She was born in Ricoholen (ph), in the Jewish hospital or in the private hospital it is much more money. Q Yeah. A And this is a tiger I'm telling you. Q Yeah. A Why, you will understand in a minute. Look, she was to go with us for a walk with us children. She was very religious. So, you know, the big cathedral in Kaunas on Vilinus Venachos (ph) she used to take us there. We used to sit down and make my lunch. Q Signs of the cross. A I mean, it is so similar because they say hallelujah. We all say hallelujah, amen, of course. Amen is very -- we say 50 times, I mean, same thing as you say. But one day when she came out of the thrufos (ph) just in the corner of Angos villios (ph) -- Q And he was shot? A And he dared to do it. He was -- he was so nervous. I can -- I can remember it. When you asked what do you remember? I remember. And I was never -- I was a church, very close to the Neuman (ph). She took us there, too, sometimes. She had a brother, Ritas (ph). 28 The brother was Hussar. You know what the Hussar is? Q In the Czarist Army? A What? Q A Hussar in the Czarist Army? A No, they call it the Hussar in Lithuanian Army, too. There was a Calarasi. Q That's a soldier. A And a Hussar. He w as -- it was like a commando unit. Q Okay. A Like my grandson is in the commando unit. It took -- he is a para trooper and up until 18 he was -- he was pin drop (ph) and the minute he got his matura, he was enlisted and then he went to para trooper for nin e months. Terrible. He went to training because the para trooper they are expected to be the Commander. Q All right. So Vitas was a Hussar? A Vitas was a Hussar. I don't know why I remember. Why do I make acknowledge because I have Vitas is he was like a g eneral. Q Yeah. A He make me sworn. He see his niece. I used to wear his hat and I was in heaven. 29 Q In heaven, yeah. A He came and then I think -- but they never went anywhere. They always sat in the kitchen. It was -- there was things that belonged to cla sses that you don't go do that. Q You don't mix in those ways. A We, of course, he used to eat at the commons to stay and he had those sports, you know, and you are right, your memories is beautiful. I look at that uniform nothing can compare. Okay. But we are not to play with our soldiers, but defending. I'm so happy now when I remember Vitas. Q Okay. A Yes, but -- but what happened later. Can we go on? Q Absolutely if you want to say something please do. A No. I mean, she was a second mother. And my li ttle brother she was everything for him. When we were shipped to the Ghetto, she wanted to take him. She says, I'll save his life. It was clear what was going on. And my mother said, no, whatever will be with us will be with him. She took T eresa. She went to the village. She crawled through the holes and the ragging and a lot of food and she helped us to going into the Ghetto. Q So you are talking now about the time when you -- all the Jews of Kaunas were ordered to go into the Ghetto in the summer of 1941, yeah? 30 A I remember there. And that's it. And there is no more Vinsa. No more Teresa. There was a Ghetto. This will talk later, but in '95, '91 when Lithuania became independent, and my brother started to nudge me, I said, Dani, forget about it. I'm not go ing there. I don't want to see it. I don't want to go to Lithuania. Forget it. He said, no, no, no, Vinsa is still alive. I want to see her. Q Was she? A No. So we went. We went. We came to Kaunas. It wasn't excitement. Q It was what? A Excitement. Such an extended. We landed in Vilinus. We come to Kaunas and the very same night, that night we were running around into town because we knew each and every street and it was like coming home in away And then I said to the guy, they had a guide. I said to the gu ide, do you know Pitsupukamos (ph)? He said, no. But I look at the map at 12 o'clock and I know where it is. We can go ourselves. We went and seen it. We sent Sanby (ph). It is a Pitsupukamos and we came and there was a man was working in the fields. I said to him, do you know Vinsa Bayono Skita? Q What was her name, Bayono Skita? A Of course, she was not married. Q Right. 31 A This is really unfair. Why should they -- unmarried, okay, they have a present. She is unmarried. And I did ask him where do you know Vinsa Bayona Skita? He said, she is dead, but her daughter Teresa she lives here. Maybe they meet us. So the guy goes in and says, do you know Uri and Dani Chanoch? They my brothers. They killed everyone. Started to cry. Because Teresa was already attach ed. She lived only on the memories, on the stories that her mother told her because they don't hold no interest for them. They was in Cohost (ph), the Russians and the times that they stay with the Cohost, this is the golden age. My mother never checked o ut with money, take money and buy this, buy this. Ladies who checked out how much and then she comes out and she sees us and she started to shout and to cry, are you alive? It was no connection in those times. Only once I sent her an invitation when I marr y Judy and she was kept in captivity because Israel was -- Q Enemy country, right. A And we have it on the video. Q You have it on video. This meeting? A My sister, no. Visit to her brother. My visit to her. My sister -in-law took a photo, a camera and made 200 hours, 200 hours we made -- we made a movie, a movie. Q Oh, my gosh. A It is very, very -- I would a say very unique film. Q I would think. 32 A In spite of the thing that she was the professional or maybe because she was the professional. Q Is Teresa still alive? A No, she died a year ago. But I contacted her. We had like family. And I'm also with her two daughters in touch. Teresa and Vinsa came back and Vinsa became the head of the village. Q She became the head of the village, that's amazing. A Why don't you ask why? Q Well, why? A B ecause the Germans needed food. So they went to the kymas (ph). Q To the villages, yes. A And they confiscated. Q Yes. A You had five pigs, they took the five pigs, but then they came to visit Kymas, Teresa came over and spoke to them in Yiddish. They understood. They said in Yiddish, don't take all the five pigs. Take two pigs. Leave us a ll something. She communicated. Nobody could communicate. Nobody spoke Yiddish in Bucykamas (ph), and she was very honored. Q In spi te of the fact that she had an illegitimate? 33 A In spite of the fact that it was already the Russian period, the religion was not anymore a dominant factor. I was really -- I was starting the story, I said, look something good came out of it. Q Yeah. A Vinsa died from cancer five years before. Q In 1990, if you went in '95. A Yeah, in 1990 she died. She had her grave and a tombstone is like a queen. She -- and Teresa had two daughters Jolanta and Rasa. Q Jolanta and Rasa. A Yes. Q So J-o-l-a-n-ta and R -a-sa. A She also had a boy. I think, maybe it was Selima (ph) or something like this. They both -- they both died by accident or by cars or by -- I don't know. They were drinking too much. This is a sickness there in Lithuania. Q Oh, yeah, huge. It is hu ge. A The drinking and I don't know what kind of a living Teresa made, a poor living, but she was happy. When I make you understand because I used to come very often to Lithuania, I tried to, to get some community property back, and there one day I came with one of our ministers and we were sitting next to the opera and the mystic garden. 34 Q Oh, yeah. A And we were having lunch and she said, I wish Stalin would come back. Q Oh, yeah. A So at least I had -- I went to Dachau. I had enough to eat. What they di d to us today, they gave us, okay, I supported it. It is not. Q I know of that sentiment. I have heard it as well. A Yes. Q Yes. A Then it was very shocking. All of this said, look. Life was organized. Okay. That was a lot of stating and a lot of negative things and so on, so forth and encapida (ph). Q Encapida is secret police. A The secret police. I brought Teresa to Israel. Q Oh, wo w. A For tw o weeks. One week with my brother and one week with us . Q Wow. A She was ex -Cinderella in Wonderland. You been there I would presume. Q No. I want to. 35 A You understand me much better than you come, of course, and get in touch with me. Q Yes. A I'll spend the day with you in Jerusalem and you will never forget it. Q I'd love it. I'd love it. A A nd now she is very religious. I took her to Wailing Wall. I said you Pontius Pilate and then here we are recohomo (ph) and here first station and the second station and she doesn't react. She doesn't try to include. She had no idea what the first station, second station, a cross is a cross, whenever she have a cross she hugged them and kissed them. Q But she had never gotten religious education? A No. Q Yeah. A But, you know, there is Jesus and wise men by the things that Jews and this is it. So I saw there was no use, no explaining about the Holy Sepulcher. Q What are the stations of the cross, in other words? A Separate cross. Q No, that is an irony. If you were to explain to her what the stations of the cross and she hadn't known what it was before. Whe n you saw them, when you went to Lithuania 36 the first time and this is a question I would really like to ask at the very end. Did something change in you in 1995? A It was matter with me that change. Q Because before you didn't want to go. And then you went and then after that you went more. So something must have changed? A There was more because I was asked to go. There is a different story. If you go back to the atrocities -- Q We haven't even gotten there yet. A Yeah. It is -- you come back to a place where you were born and you like it. The weather was good. It wasn't hot like here or anything, hot sometimes and everything was good. Every morning we used to go with a couple at the inn. Q To have some coffee. A And butter and the milk and the school and t he Dutcha (ph). I mean, it wasn't a big family. We were normal middle class family and every year we went to grandma's and this was the highlight of my life to go to the schitel (ph) and she came to pick us up from the train with the local kutcher (ph), with the local guy that had -- Q A driver who had a carriage? 37 A Horse carriage and then for a week, the hostel was somehow connected. It is all dangerous because most of the people love her and I would ask Canuzum (ph) with the father there was a difference . It was fun because -- Q Really. A -- because we did the dishes, went together with the Gila (ph) conquer the almost became as far as Turkey and there you saw the Karakash. Karakash are a Jewish sect that believe only what is written with no interpretatio ns. Maybe the other regions in the Bavaria, this was after the expulsion from Spain they went to Turkey. And when people saw the twitter this takes people. Q This is medieval history. A The situation could only improve. So they came, another couple of hund red people and followed the Karakash. So, therefore, in this schitel I have a Sephardic name, Sephardic name. It is Enoch, not as a first name. Enoch is the grandson of Adam and Eve. The son of Cain, which is not a big thing. I think all of them, but -- but then you find German and you find durmichaven (ph) and donmeh, a lot of donmeh, which is a lot of selanikli not covered, not covered lot of. So, of course, Bita (ph) that came over Exkalzaday (ph). The schitel was, but my sister didn't go. Her mother didn't let her. The air is not good enough for a girl. Q The hygiene is not good enough. 38 A And we -- we used to fish and used to go to -- it was better than somehow, but this was a pack problem between my mother and grandma, but between my father and grandma and usually at the reunion for the schitel because many of them became Palestinians and went to Palestine and out of four generations I also think and they make getting things together and mainly they speak about Sara -Leah because she was such a dominant personality and this Lila (ph), of course, was a dominant one. Q So your grandmother and your uncle. I'm just saying that for the tape. A Sara -Leah, Sara -Leah, Sara -Leah. So why -- but my little daughter says one that was here, she works in York and she -- I love my grandma. Please, she has the name Gaila (ph) give her all my grandmother's name, Sara -Leah . So, you know, that everybody goes to the admils (ph) the girls. This is compulsive. You have to. So she sits there at the crematorium camp and they call it Auschwitz, you know, and they said that -- then they said Trina, Gallia, Sara -Leah, both of them, two girls knew that's three girls actually. This is a joke. Q Okay. So let's -- A So we go back to \u0152 Q We were -- I was asking -- do you need to change -- A You better ask me. I'll carry you away in -- End of File One 39 Beginning File Two A: I can visualize it. ",
