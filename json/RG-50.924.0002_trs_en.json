I mean, there have been other holocausts, as you know, but I was convinced that the Jewish people would be subject to another holocaust on equal or worse conditions as the first one, and I wanted to do everything in my power to avoid that. Now, I\u2122m not very proud of this today, I am not very happy about it, but that\u2122s how I felt in 1945, just coming out of a camp, having lost all my uncles and aunts.

That\u2122s another thing I\u2122m not very proud of, but that\u2122s true. I wanted to make something. I had no education. I had no experience. So everything you see today and hear is made out of the idea: I\u2122ve got be somebody, I have got to achieve something in life, and I don\u2122t want to be a non-entity, as I used to be for so many years.

I never had the problem like some survivors, that they didn\u2122t want to talk about anything that happened to them. I did. When they\u2122re about 12 or 13 years old, and they were living with us in Ohio, we\u0152 I used the occasion when their history\u0152 in school, when their history reached World War II, and I used that as an occasion and said, \ufb01I want you guys to listen to something. And here is my story.\ufb02 And I did tell them. I\u2122m not sure they grasped everything, because it was an enormous burden on them suddenly to find out that their father was 4 years in prison and lived under conditions which were less than human. And so they accepted\u0152 They were shocked. They wer e actually shocked. Then I noticed that they began sort of ad\u0152 to admire me , you know, and saying, \ufb01My dad made it,\ufb02 you know. They didn\u2122t understand it wasn\u2122t only my doing, but they were sort of proud that they made it. Now I need to ask you to understand that my family in Denver, they are married \u0152 they -they are not Jews. I mean, they\u2122re Jews on a piece of paper, but that\u2122s about it, because there\u2122s also a mixed marriage, and they are not raised in the sense that they have compassion with the Jewish fait h as it happens through the centuries. You know. My local daughter and her husband are very Jewish. And he\u2122s from Montreal, and was raised very Jewish, and they\u2122re much more receptive to the fact that I work in a museum, that I try to spread the word by giving speeches about my life. So in that respect, I must say that I have sort of half and half: one family who knows of, and said, \ufb01Oh yeah, well, my dad was\u0152 is a survivor,\ufb02 and then let it go; while my younger daughter is much more saying in Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 9 pride, \ufb01Mymy dad made it,\ufb02 you know, and tells people what-what happened to me as far as she remembers."

Well, I do in some respect, as far as the aspects of Germany are concerned which are cultural in nature, from Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 10 literature to music and the theaters and so forth. As a citizen, let me give you an example. When I applied for my visa, I was interviewed by the American consul in Berlin. And one of the (which I thought was rather stupid) question he asked me is: If there would be a war between the United States and Germany, whose side would you f-fight for? (you know) Well, obviously I wouldn\u2122t\u0152 Remember, that was in 1947, (I) shortly after the war.

When our ship landed in New York in February of 1947, and we entered the harbor, and there was the statue of liberty (see, it\u2122s coming back; I\u2122m beginning to cry), we all cried. We literally cried. It was the most wonderful sight \u0152 Excuse me for being sentimental, but it was something \u0152 It comes right back to me. You cannot imagine. To enter this land as a free person. My God. What did we see in New York, the first thing, was lights. Americans had lights. Everything in Germany was destroyed. It was dark. It was miserable.

So I went to one of the officers and says, \ufb01Captain, what can I do to enlist in the British army?\ufb02 And he said, \ufb01Who are you?\ufb02 So I told him, and he said, \ufb01Where are you from?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01In -in\u0152 I\u2122m from Berlin.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Well, you can\u2122t.\ufb02 I said, \ufb01Why not?\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Well, you\u2122re a German.\ufb02 And that is something I certainly didn\u2122t want to hear, being a German, after having just spent four years in a concentration camp, arrested by the very German. So I said, \ufb01Well, I\u2122m not a German.\ufb02 \ufb01Oh yeah?\ufb02 he said. \ufb01Where were you born?\ufb02 So I said, \ufb01Berlin.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Where\u2122s Berlin located?\ufb02 I said, \ufb01In Germany.\ufb02 He said, \ufb01Voil\u00e0. You are a German. End of story.\ufb02 So you see, itit all comes back what you make [of it]. Ambition and the drive to belong. The British army didn\u2122t want me because I was a German. May I say that very honestly I certainly didn\u2122t feel like being a German after being persecuted from 1933 to \u212245. But here he was, told me, very logical, \ufb01Berlin is the capital of Germany, so you\u2122re German.\ufb02 And so in answer to your question, it\u2122s a desire to belong and a desire to be among people who accept you for what you are, not ask about your religion or anything else. And so that what drove me. That what really drove me. I was a very lonely person with nothing. You know. My mother was still alive and\u0152 but we had nothing. We were nothing. We were constantly told that we were no good. And I wanted to be accepted. So those were the driving forces which shaped my life ever since I survived the camp."

We were sponsored by a Jewish organization, the Joint Distribution Committee, and they put us up in the Hotel Marseilles in New York. And the next couple days we were interviewed. And they had established a system where various Jewish communities in the United States, in various cities (I don\u2122t know all the details), agreed to sponsor a refugee. So when my turn came to be interviewed, they told me that number one, I can\u2122t stay in New York. For some Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 15 reason, everybody wanted to stay in New York, most of the refugees, because they felt at home or they had relatives up there. So I said, \ufb01Well, all right. I don\u2122t have anybody in New York anyway. What are my choices?\ufb02 So they said, \ufb01Well,\ufb02 they looked at their lists and said, \ufb01You can either go to Chicago or can go to Dallas.\ufb02 Had two minutes to answer that question. So, make a long story very short, I rationalized it very cleverly. I figured Chicago there are gangsters, and in Dallas there are cowboys, which are a lesser of two evils, and I wo und up in Dallas. That\u2122s why I got to Dallas. And I was miserable. I was absolutely miserable. Would you be interested to know why? All right. I was miserable only because I had no money, no friends, no nothing. The Jewish community in those days were not interested in refugees or survivors. Not at all. They did it out of a sense of obligation to sponsor one or two refugees, but giving speeches or asking me how was it in the camps, not once. Not at all. Not ever. And they did their (quote, unquote) \ufb01duty\ufb02 to sponsor somebody, and I was very lonely, very miserable. I won\u2122t go into details what I worked at. They got me a job, which was terrible. And then there was no feeling of belonging. My mother was still living in Germany and starving, \u212247, ration cards. And so I finally said, I can\u2122t live lie this. And then the Army became like a \u0152 I\u2122ve seen the soldiers. Like the British soldier I talked about, the American soldiers in Berlin, they had a good life. They belonged, they did their job, they\u0152 and so forth. And I felt, that\u2122s my answer. And I enlisted in July of 1947."

            "answer": "The dimensions and the degree of what I felt of being German. Now, that is a question I just absolutely love, because when I start off giving my normal speeches, I always tell the audience, if they\u2122re old enough to understand, that there\u2122s actually two things to the Holocaust. One thing is the psychological, and one is the physical. Well, everybody is familiar with the physically: concentration camp, gas chambers, evacuations, all that. But the psychological aspect which I stress, and what I ask my audience, I make them raise their hand. What nationalities are you? They say American. Say, \ufb01What do you feel like abou t America?\ufb02 And they usually tell you they\u2122re proud of it, blah-blahblah. And then I tell them, \ufb01Suppose one day somebody comes and says, \u201aYou have no more rights. You don\u2122t belong to us. We don\u2122t want you. We gave you\u0152 We tolerate you to stay in our country, but as far as belonging to us, that\u2122s gone.\u2122\ufb02 And that is what happened to us up here. And in September of 1935, during the Nuremberg\u0152 and the Nuremberg laws were passed, which in simple terms simply took our citizenship away, it made us residents wi thout any rights to [go]. That was a tremendous blow to my parents. I mean, my father and my step-father both fought in World War I. We so thoroughly believed in Germany . [And] more, much more which I have no time to tell you. Suffice it to say that my par ents considered themselves German first and Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 19 Jewish second. And \ufb01German citizen of Jewish faith\ufb02 was the slogan we use. That, I was raised. And it was \u0152 As the laws were passed, dis -discriminatory to the Jewish faith, and it took away more and more of German y itself. We were in Germany, we spoke German, we still had access to German books, but the people denied us. The people didn\u2122t want us. The very things we-we wanted to belong to said, \ufb01You may want to belong to us, but we don\u2122t want you to belong to us.\ufb02 So the-the-the feeling that the German citizenship and the German country itself and its people denied us, was a tremendous blow to us. In fact, to me, that was in some ways equally bad than the physical aspect, which were bad enough. But to lose one\u2122s country, for which my uncle had died in World War I, my father and biological father were both officers in World War I, fighting this country \u0152 I\u2122ll give you an example of my family. My mother had a brother who was what one commonly called a black sheep. What did you do with black sheep? You send him to America. So in October of 1913, he went to New York and lived there. A year later, not quite a year later, in Sept \u0152 in August of 1914, the war broke out. And what did this guy do? He smuggled him\u0152 gave up his j ob in New York, smuggled himself back on a Spanish ship to Germany, enlisted in the army, and was killed in October. So that just gives you some idea how we felt about Germany. My grand\u0152 My-my mother\u2122s father committed suicide because he could not stomach the idea that Germany had lost the war in 1918. In 1919 he killed himself. And so that this illustrates. I was young. I mean, I had not even the experience. I was growing up. But all the things my parents talked forever about what Germany, its culture, it s music, its-its land, its territory, its trees. Germany is a very beautiful country. And it tells us, \ufb01We don\u2122t care how beautiful it is. You don\u2122t belong in it.\ufb02 And so that shaped this whole thing, the torn between the admiration of my parents versus th e Nazi attitude and saying \ufb01We don\u2122t want you.\ufb02 Very difficult."

There was discrimination against Jews. It was a very subtle type of discrimination. You would, for example, when you looked for housing, find an advertising that a house is for sale, with a quote that \ufb01Christian church nearby.\ufb02 And those were indicator (which I learned from other people who were here much longer) that this is a sign they don\u2122t want any Jews. Universities had quotas for Jewish students. And there was a degree of anti -Semitism here. It wasn\u2122t personally. Nobody came on your street and kicked you. But it was there. There were certain class distinctions, and it took me a while to get used to that. In fact, I didn\u2122t even understand what it meant, \ufb01Christian church nearby,\ufb02 that that meant \ufb01We don\u2122t want anybody [but] white Anglo-Saxon Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 22 Protestants,\ufb02 you know. They weren\u2122t even sure they weren\u2122t Catholics. But those things, you slowly accept and\u0152 You got to remember that times change. Ameri ca has become much more liberal, much more liberal. I mean \u0152 I\u2122ll give you a very personal example. One of my children moved in with her boyfriend. And nobody raised an eyebrow. I wasn\u2122t very happy, my wife wasn\u2122t very happy, but we are from another generation. We didn\u2122t stop them. But she didn\u2122t experience any problems. Nobody said, \ufb01How can you?\ufb02 And so there was a\u0152 America has become a very \u0152 much more liberal. It still isn\u2122t 100%. No country is ever 100% liberal. But America has changed much more. I mean, there are reasons for that. The Supreme Court ruling about (you know) Roe versus Wade, and you have the integration, school integration thing. So as a whole, Americans have changed to be more liberal. Doesn\u2122t mean you are liberally politically. That is a different story. I\u2122m not addressing it. I\u2122m [dressing] it as socially.

I\u2122m now no longer agonizing: Will there be a holocaust here? (you know, and\u0152 ) There\u2122s a book from Philip Roth which he just wrote, that Lindbergh became president , (you know) the very Lindbergh who was, deep down, a fascist.

            "answer": "The first thing I can say to this, that \u0152 about right or wrong, that I all of a sudden found myself in a society which had laws, not antilaws but positive laws, laws which govern our life, which I may not always like or agree with it, but I came into a society where the law went from the bottom up. It was created by Congress and approved by the president. We had a society which based on law. Everything here is based on law, because otherwise we wouldn\u2122t have that many lawsuits. You know. People can sue. People can try to equalize a wrong by going to the courts and saying, \ufb01This is not right.\ufb02 Was totally new to me. Totally new to me. I had no idea that could even be done. Now, the Germans had courts during the Nazi time. Oh, and they followed the law, except that the laws were terrible. You know. If you listened to a foreign broadcast, the judge had no choice but to condemn you to death. I mean, those are laws and laws. These laws here were based on our Constitution, which again it contains the Bill of Rights. So you come right back to the fact that living in this society took some adjusting. I mean, I really wasn\u2122t quite sure. Give you an example. When I came, I had a knife with me to \u0152 in case something was wrong. I went to the police station to register that knife. The guy said, \ufb01What do you want me to do with that?\ufb02 And I said, \ufb01Sir, I would like to be sure that you write on my card\ufb02 \u0152 He said, \ufb01I don\u2122t have a card of you. Why should I have a card of you?\ufb02 I learned suddenly, this is not a country where everything is registered and (you know) and noted down and so forth. In Germany, till today, when you move from point A to point B, you got to deregister at one police station and re -register at another one. So I-I was coming down to\u0152 when I went in Dallas, I moved once. And the first time, I went to the police and said, \ufb01I want to register.\ufb02 (you know) Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 25 These guys were very nice. They thought they\u2122re probably dealing with some jerk who doesn\u2122t know what in the world he\u2122s talking about. But they didn\u2122t know my background or anything else. So this right or wrong becomes a very difficult thing to adopt to it, because it is\u0152 we are governed by laws. (you know) May not all like the laws, but they\u2122re there. And they\u2122re voted on. They\u2122re not arbitrarily by one dictator says, \ufb01I want this to hap pen.\ufb02 And so all the laws we have went through a process of being accepted or denied. But if they are accepted, then it\u2122s a majority of something or somebody who wants these law to be existing. So that took a while to get used to it. Very difficult. Wasn\u2122t even easy.

There are hundreds, hundreds of schoolchildren (seventh graders, eighth graders) come to the museum. Okay. They get that on their itinerary and they come in there. What I normally do with them, I give them a little quiz before I Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 26 send them up to the fourth floor where the Holocaust story begins.

But they don\u2122t ask any questions. Neither did my kids, even though they had an in-house capability to find out. (you know) They listened. My daughter came and the first voices up there, she came and listened to it, you know, and she congratulated me on my good speech and so forth. But did she ask any questions in detail? Their lives are so full, and they are\u0152 their lives are so engrossed in their daily activities, personally, I\u2122m afraid they don\u2122t even want to know. They know the basic outlines and they know what happened. Details: Did I have enough to eat? And if I did, what did I get to eat? No. I try to tell them sometimes that our staple food was something \u0152 was barley. They didn\u2122t even know what barley was. And so instead of asking, \ufb01What\u2122s barley?\ufb02 you know, and \ufb01How come?\ufb02 it is \ufb01Ah, mm-hm, ah.\ufb02 So it is\u0152 My children unfortunately did not\u0152 When they got older, sometimes they did. But then they were married, then they had their own problems, they lived in their own world. And so no. The answer basically: My children \u0152 Now, it\u2122s strictly personal. My children did not demonstrate a degree of curiosity I was hoping they would do. For example, both of them hate history. And now the Holocaust\u0152 you cannot understand the Holocaust, you know something about history , World War I, the loss, the Versailles Treaty, you know, unless you know sometimes. And I was hoping that they would ask me some question: How did a Hitler come into power? Well, I\u2122ll be honest with you. They never did. I shoved it down their throat becau se I made them, but they did not, out of their own volition, come and say, \ufb01Hey, Dad, tell us. What happened in Germany? How come they elected Hitler?\ufb02 You know. They didn\u2122t. So for what it\u2122s worth. Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 27"

I try to make it so that each age group is more or less involved, depending whether I talk to graduate students or eighth grades, and so I tailor it that way. But to what degree I\u2122m successful? There is a \u0152 Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 28 There is a sign at the Holocaust Museum, \ufb01Remember.\ufb02 You know. It\u2122s on the outside when you come in. I\u2122m not sure they remember very much. They-they will go home and they will know there are tragedies. They are probably more impressed to some degree of what they see there, [and] what they hear from a survivor. But that\u2122s probably not fair, because I don\u2122t always know. I just have the impression \u0152 For example, we recommend, the museum recommends that a visit to the museum should be no less than 2\u00bd hours, to walk through the Holocau st story. When you see kids coming back in 45 minutes, and many do, you get an idea of the perception which these kids have. They walk through because they were told to do it. They look at some of the pictures. There\u2122s nobody there to explain it to them. ( you know) We\u0152 The type of information I convey to you now, they don\u2122t have the benefit. These are objects which they see. Most [of] the time when you ask th em what was impressed you most, were the shoes which were there, but is physical. The-the-the wagon, the railroad car, that\u2122s physical. But when you\u0152 For example, there is one where, from 1933 to 1945, it\u2122s a rolling thing on a TV screen, where all the antiJewish laws are passed, which to me is the most frightening exhibit, not only because I lived there, but if I would see this Amin, who had passed one law after another, if he\u0152 if he didn\u2122t kill them outright. You go by there, that doesn\u2122t mean and it doesn\u2122t sink in. Each law is a tragedy in itself. And you have to [take] the time, and you have to [do] the willingness to read this and comprehend. What does that mean, that you cannot use public transportation? Kids would say, \ufb01Well, we don\u2122t have any public in Sheboygan anyway, so what\u2122s the big tragedy?\ufb02 You know. Not realizing that Berlin was much, much bigger, and we had to go to work. We were forced to go to work. We couldn\u2122t use public transportation. So the perception is difficult. And it depends much on the age and the preparation of the children. There are exceptions. There are some schoolchildren who come who are well prepared. The story of Anne Frank, for example, is one of the wonderful examples where kids take an interest."

As far as German Jews are concerned, the Nazis only transported three groups of Germans. First of all, the majority were old people, old people. The Nazis literally, in their conference in Wannsee, in the protocols you will read : We don\u2122t need to gas them.

You have no business being here.\ufb02 That was my first introduction to thing.

I think I mentioned already \ufb01Christian church nearby.\ufb02 There were Tape 1 4 ROBERT BEHR page 41 ideas of \u0152 that rent restrictions against Jews. (you know) People told me that. I hadn\u2122t actually seen this. And there was a certain degree of discrimination.

And I happily lied about it and told everybody I was from Switzerland, who didn\u2122t have a need to know. German had of course Swe \u0152 They speak German up there. And they all accepted it.

Very many had hard feelings, and sometimes even against the Japanese, bu t that were \u0152 they were Germany\u2122s allies and so forth. So you got to learn this in your experience.

I mean, if anybody ever seen piles of dead bodies, I mean, not in a newsreel, not on television, but people who are [ruthlessly] put on top of each other, and people who died from starvation, are not very pretty to look at. Is nowhere near what a viewing looks here, where people are embalmed and look very nice and have good clothing on. Tape 1 4 ROBERT BEHR page 49 People I saw die or dead were nothing more than a piece of (I can\u2122t say human) a former human being, which I had to carry in a wagon outside the city to be burned. (you know) So what you do, you lose all respect for death. You lose all empathy and you\u0152 You only care how heavy is the body, because I got to lift it. And so what you see in movies sometimes, or in theaters, or read in books, death became ugly, even though you had nothing to do with the killing; but under the condition we lived in, the-the\u0152 Theresienstadt city was a city which had about 4,000 inhabitants, not counting the mi litary. They crammed 60,000 people in there. Now, just imagine this. People died. They didn\u2122t even have room to die sometimes. And that was bad. It was really, really very bad. And the\u0152 your\u0152 You were supposed to treat death respectful. You know? Respectful of the person who lived and achieved his duty, all gone. Survival and everything else wasn\u2122t important. And if it meant carrying dead bodies outside the city, you just did it. It was just another job. That\u2122s all. But compassion, sadness, pity, to be very honest with you, all gone. All gone.

My emotions were dead, and I am nowhere near where you can glorify thethe person\u2122s death and remember only the good things and all the\u0152 I didn\u2122t know most of them. They were dead.

And I needed to get in there because my mother was going down with the food they were having. It was never enough. And I finally did something which is difficult to describe. II became friends with a Czech man who was already in a kitchen. (you know) And the relati onship between Czechs and Germans was not good. And these were both prisoners. That is like in today\u2122s prison where you have gangs. I mean, if you\u0152 if you expand that, you had one group of German Jews and you had one group of Czech Jews. The Czech Jews ran the ghetto, no question, more or less very well. They had of course all the good positions, one of which being\u0152 There were several of them. One, you could be a Jewish policeman, and you could be working in a kitchen. That was all Czechs. And I sa \u0152 II met the guy and I wined and dined him in that\u0152 but not literally, but I sort of \u0152 For example, the Czechs always believed the German Jews helped get Hitler elected. We didn\u2122t stand up. Oh God, we had arguments. We did not stand up to the Germans when Hitler tried to become chancellor, and they blamed us. It was our fault that Hitler ever came to power, and that they are now\u0152 have an occupied country, and they are sitting in a concentration camp. So I began to admit this. I said, \ufb01Yeah, we could have done more.\ufb02 And that was strictly a Tape 1 4 ROBERT BEHR page 51 psychological attempt to get this guy\u2122s friendship . And sure enough, we became sort of\u0152 not friends but acquaintances. He liked me, he was older than I am, and he was a chief of one of the kitchen. And finally I told him, I said, \ufb01Look, I would love to work in a kitchen for you.\ufb02 I didn\u2122t want to work for him at all, but I told him. And so I sort of pros\u0152 myself, prostituted myself mentally by saying things which I really didn\u2122t mean. And I got the job. I was in a kitchen, and I could take some food home for my parents. Not legally. That was strictly forbidden. But we managed. And I was able to save my mother\u2122s life by that. (you know) So.

So be it. But my opinion is that the whole relationship between the Christian world and the Jewish world in America changed drastically due to the Six Day War in Israel against the Arab states. Those enormous unexpected visit \u0152victory in six days, where the Israeli army defeated Egypt and Jordan and Syria and came out completely as a vict ory, suddenly put Israel on the map like never before, with the possible except of 1948, when thethe United Nations allowed Israel to exist. Not ever since that time was Israel suddenly in the minds of so many people. Suddenly there was a little tiny country with a bunch of refugees who resettled, and they beat the hell out of\u0152 out of the vastly superior (numerically at least) nations. And I almost felt that the attitude of the Americans began to change. There was a certain degree of respect. May not be lo ve and admiration, but admiration did play in it. They said, \ufb01My God, look at those guys.\ufb02 You know, Moshe Dayan with his black eye patch. You remember that? These became heroes, folk heroes. And Americans are very attuned to people who do good\u0152 do do brave and good things, and become their\u0152 Americans are not ignoring this. [They never say], \ufb01Eh, what\ufb02\u0152 No. Americans admire this. And suddenly there is Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 52 this tiny little state which is in everybody\u2122s mouth. Andand Israel began to get admired. And I think that a lot had to do with the change of attitude, even politically. I mean, our government supports Israel, (you know) and-and financially, militarily, and commercial \u0152 economically. So this was did something which none of us could have ever achieved without it . That was a past. That was gone. [You ....] here. So forget the Holocaust. That\u2122s fine. You\u2122re here now, and now this war. And the victory of that war, in my personal opinion, electrified the American people. It really did. And from then on, so many things changed of the political and social and economic and military attitude of the United States towards Israel. It\u2122s remarkable.

He\u0152 The A mericans and the British, but I\u2122m sure the Americans, created a questionnaire where all the Nazi organizations and subdivisions were listed. And people had to fill those out. So there were some organizations [in it] were nominally Nazi but they weren\u2122t. Ot hers were. And so my job was to flush out who did what to whom during the war. And you got to remember that the be- the worst thing about the thing is that there weren\u2122t any Nazis. That whole German people unanimously and individually decided, \ufb01Me? Never N azi. Him, you go to ask.\ufb02 (you know) And it was terrible. They just absolutely will not say, \ufb01Yeah, I made a mistake. I followed him. I believed in him.\ufb02 Very seldom did you find it. You find it in literature. But face to face? There\u2122s an excellent movie out called Downfall . And that movie is the last week of Hitler\u2122s life. And it introduces the person who was instrumental in furnishing the information, which was Hitler\u2122s secretary. Now, she lived with him day in and day out. In her introduction in that movie, she said she had no idea what the\u0152 what the Nazis did with the Jewish people. She knew that the Nazis didn\u2122t like them; they knew that they deprived them of work, andand some Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 61 degree of comfort. But that they actually evacuated them, she knew that to o. That was only to work on road construction or whatever the case may have been. But that they put them in the death camp by the thousands, she never knew. And now, you\u2122re going to believe this? She was Hitler\u2122s secretary, [Krist ol/Traudl Junge]. And she said that outright in the movie, (you know) after it was [found], and\u0152 So that\u2122s the attitude you\u2122ll find. \ufb01It wasn\u2122t me.\ufb02 And then you have mitigating circumstances, if I may say that. Every civil servant in Germany during the time had to belong to the N azi Party. All schoolteachers were civil servants. There were mass admission to the party, because they wanted to keep their job, so they had to apply. Could you condemn those? You\u0152 Can you put them in the same bucket? So what I\u2122m trying to say is, there a re various degrees of guilt. (you know) If somebody joins a party in order to keep his job and feed his family, well, I\u2122m not so sure I want to put him in the same bucket as some SS guard who beats up Jews for fun. So yes, they were both Nazis, but within the party\u0152 And one needs to be objective about this, because there are people, Jewish people in particular, who condemn them right out. \ufb01They\u2122re all bad.\ufb02 Well, that isn\u2122t the case. And so I always try to judge the person by what duties he perform or she p erform within the Nazi organization, because some of them really, they were just pushed in there and they had nothing to do with, other than being nominally party members.

And he looked that judge clear in the eye and says, \ufb01Yes, sir, I know him for ten years or longer.\ufb02 And I thought, well, good. And-and so it was a very proud moment. It was \u0152 It was great. I t was \u0152 It was something \u0152 Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 66 And of course the first thing you do, like all naturalized citizen (I don\u2122t know anybody who didn\u2122t if they were old enough), you want a passport. You know. The citizen oath and the document you get, which is a very nice formal typ e document that on such and such a date you, Robert Behr, were naturalized by Southern District Court of New York, and so forth, that was fine. But what you really wanted was a passport. So the first thing I did, I applied for a passport. And I was so proud when that document came. Now I really felt I was a citizen. With -with the oath and the document, I knew I was; but feeling it took that little blue book in my hand and saying \ufb01American citizen.\ufb02 And that was a page in there where it says that all persons having contact ... are requested to assist Mr. Behr, Robert Behr. I mean, it was just-just a piece of paper, but it was tremendously meaningful. It was \u0152 And you\u2122ll find if you talk to other naturalized citizen, they all want passport, even though they have no intention of traveling, but they want a passport. (you know) It has a tremendous meaning. It still has today. I\u2122m over in Paris, or in Berlin, and I see the American embassy with a flag. It does something to me. It-it\u2122s not just \ufb01Oh, I have to go in here, and it\u2122s another security and I have to go through this and this.\ufb02 This is my country. (you know) And even though we\u2122re not always universally liked, people don\u2122t even like Americans, at least per se, but for individuals they usually have a great deal respect. But when you see the flag and you have that passport, talk about belonging, you really do. And you feel it, and it\u2122s there. And I don\u2122t think I exaggerate. It\u2122s true for me, but I\u2122ll bet you dollars to donuts that\u2122s true for many, many immigrants. It gives you something which is\u0152 Why do we stand up when we see the flag? Respect, isn\u2122t it? It\u2122s just a piece of cloth. The Supreme Court said you can burn it. Nothing will happen to you. I toototally disagree with that decision. It\u2122s not freedom of s peech. To me, that\u2122s much more. People who take America for granted do not impress me. People have died for what we are today. From the Revolutionary War, to the 1812 War, to the ag. And to say you can burn it, or you can ignore it, to me that\u2122s something\u0152 I lived Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 67 for that flag, because I wanted to come and be a part of that thing. And with the little passport, I did it. Well, okay."

For example, if you get a questionnaire because you applied for a job or a credit card or whatever, there\u2122s a sentence in there, \u201as a question in there: Are-are you or have you ever been imprisoned? What do you put down there? Do you put down there yes, and then start writing two pages of explanation? Or do you simply say no? So you see, it pursues you.

It\u2122s perfectly all right. But I don\u2122t know what to answer. So mostly in that particular case I\u2122m inclined to say no, I was not in jail, because it wasn\u2122t that type of jail. Give you another example how tha t comes back. I applied for a clearance, or was asked to apply for a clearance. And in that, you have to list all your relatives.

Well, usually you find them by accident. Everybody finds their spouse usually by accident, unless they grow up together (that happens) and they get married, and that becomes a good marriage or notnot becomes a good marriage. But in my case, most of the people met their spouses by accident, and then you go back and do this: Why do I love that person? What is it in her that attracts me? So you began to look at the thing, and it could be sexual, it could be emotional, it could be all sorts of things. It could be a combination of things. But somehow you got to crystallize that, because what \u0152 when you have a friendship (in my case, I look at it) which is purely sexual and doesn\u2122t have any intellectual background, then you can go with your wife to bed but you can\u2122t talk to her.

And in order to do that, I\u2122ve got to have an intellectual background. Tape 17 ROBERT BEHR page 72 My wife is European, I\u2122m European. I\u2122m not even sure. I\u2122ve often thought about: Would I be happy with an American girl? And I don\u2122t mean anybody in particular. I have my doubts. Not that American ladies or women are worse, but they have different \u0152 their upbringing, their characteristics. They\u2122re not better or they\u2122re not worse; they\u2122re just different. And without going into details, I found so many ladies I met who are married, good marriages and everything, but there\u2122s a difference between them and a European woman. And again I want to stress, it\u2122s neither better nor worse. It\u2122s just different. Culturally, education -wise, habit -wise, you know, that sort of thing. (So, I hope I answered that.)"
