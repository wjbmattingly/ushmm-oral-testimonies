I have no uncles, never had any brothers and sisters, I had no aunts, and they\u2019re all killed. So what I have here now is really my entire family, as I just described it."

            "answer": "Well, it depends who you ask. (you know) If you ask me, I think I\u2019m perfectionist by itself, I\u2019m a little demanding, because I want things to do right, and I do the best I can for my family. I\u2019m not always as patient as I should be, but as a whole, I think if you were to ask my kids, they would agree that I\u2019m a very good provider and father to raise them and take care of them in their need. They come to me when they need something. Whether it\u2019s advice or something financially, they come to me. I\u2019m their first stop, other than their husbands, to come to me. So I think I\u2019m, on all, a decent father."

            "answer": "That\u2019s a very interesting question. I have to go back a little bit. If you know about the Holocaust, you know that the Nazis created several categories of Jewish people. There were Jewish people with both parents, and there are people who were out of mixed marriage, one Christian partner and one Jewish partner, regardless of whether the man is Jewish or the wife 1s Jewish and the other party is Christian. So I was very concerned, because the mixed marriage\u2014 children from mixed marriages or the mixed marriages themselves were protected to some degree for some of the horrors which transpired to the\u2014 during the Holocaust. And I was always wondering. I\u2019ve never said that to anybody. You are really, literally the first one. When I got out of the camp after four years in there, I thought I would [not] marry a Jewish woman, because I didn\u2019t want my children to be full Jewish. I figured, if they are [in] a mixed marriage, then if there ever is another holocaust with the same criteria as the Nazis were, then they would to-to a degree be protected because they were\u2014 the German word is Mischlinge (that means mixed religions), and protect them. And I deliberately did not marry a Jewish woman. I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 3 did not look for one, because I wanted to have my children born of a mixed marriage."

            "question": "That was your fear that it could happen again?",
            "answer": "Yes. The idea that the Holocaust may be repeated 1n one form or another was so definitely embedded in my mind in 1945, when we were liberated, I did not ever believe that there wouldn\u2019t be a holocaust against the Jews. I mean, there have been other holocausts, as you know, but I was convinced that the Jewish people would be subject to another holocaust on equal or worse conditions as the first one, and I wanted to do everything in my power to avoid that. Now, I\u2019m not very proud of this today, I am not very happy about it, but that\u2019s how I felt in 1945, just coming out of a camp, having lost all my uncles and aunts. I wanted to protect any children I may have from that fate."

            "answer": "Would I\u2014 Would I do this all over again if I were to be married today, picking a wife simply by ethnic background rather than the normal conditions of love and affection? Probably not. Probably after 60 years [of the] war, I sort of [became] convinced that my anxieties and my fear were probably not justified as far as the Jewish people in America or other places were concerned. There\u2019s anti-Semitism, as you know, everywhere. But it doesn\u2019t manifest itself by killing everybody left and right, just because we\u2019re Jewish. So would I do this again? No, I would not. I would probably marry the person I love, regardless of her ethnic or religious background."

I mean, if I work in a Holocaust Museum, where there are a lot of non- Jewish people working, I let the people believe what they may. But I\u2019m still https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 4 reluctant, to this day, to go out and say, \u201cI\u2019m Jewish.\u201d And I can tell you, if somebody call\u2014tells me \u201cHe\u2019s a Jew,\u201d I really get offended, because I rather prefer that somebody says \u201cHe\u2019s Jewish.\u201d I never volunteer that.

            "answer": "Good question. How would I identity myself? If I tell you the truth, as an American citizen of Jewish faith. No. The order of importance is the American citizenship, and the religious aspect is secondary, since I\u2019m not raised as a religious person in the first place. So I would feel quite secure, but I would never volunteer to go out and advertise my Jewishness. Other people are proud. They- they obviously tell everybody who needs to know, \u201cYes, I\u2019m Jewish and I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d I would never do that. I would\u2014 I would accept being Jewish, but I don\u2019t advertise it."

From 1933 to 1945, it was terrible to be Jewish. And it\u2019s not fear so much as habit. You know? You actually\u2014 It becomes second nature not to advertise it. Now, that\u2019s very personal. That is not true for all the Jewish people. But for me, it is."

            "question": "How would you describe your personality?",
            "answer": "Well, I don\u2019t know how much time we have, but in any case, my personality is shaped by the fact that for many years I was denied any opportunity to be somebody, to become somebody, to have something, and so that has ruined my life. I by\u2014 I am by nature a very ambitious person. Can be detrimental to your marriage, in many aspects. And it\u2019s difficult to say but you want me to be honest, https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 5 that my work came first, my career came first, and my family came second. That\u2019s another thing I\u2019m not very proud of, but that\u2019s true. I wanted to make something. I had no education. I had no experience. So everything you see today and hear is made out of the idea: I\u2019ve got be somebody, I have got to achieve something in life, and I don\u2019t want to be a non-entity, as I used to be for so many years. So that shaped my-\u2014 the fact that I knew nothing, had nothing, and wanted to become somebody, that is the driving factor. So \u201cambition\u201d is probably a catch word for that."

            "question": "Ambition is related to a sense of a lost identity and loss of control?",
            "answer": "Oh, that\u2019s absolutely right. I was driven by those things, and it shaped my life. It shaped my career, it shaped what I did, and I wanted to get as high up as I can, and I wanted to be somebody who is recognized for his ability, not by his Jewish faith, but for his achievement in life and what he can do."

And so it totally shaped my life. It\u2014 Of all these stories which are about the Holocaust, 95% of them apply to me: no school, no-no money, no nothing. And so you become a person who- a bare existence. To survive, even before the concentration camp, was of major importance. You were subject to the whims of any German who didn\u2019t like your face or didn\u2019t like your attitude. He could do something, could denounce you, and the end would be there, you see. And so that is such strong factors, you don\u2019t easily get rid of them. You don\u2019t easily get rid of them. And they stay with you. And it takes a very strong person to not only create a physical life but a psychological existence, where you feel that you are among people who accept you for what you are, rather than deny you because of what you are. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 6"

            "answer": "Well, the best\u2014 How do I deal with those factors? Well, the easiest way is what I just told you. I do not advertise \u2019'm Jewish. I\u2019m not proud of to be Jewish. I hide it. If somebody asks me, I admit it, but I would never volunteer it. That\u2019s a direct outgrowth of the fact that when you lived in Germany from \u201933 until we were arrested in \u00b042, that 1t was something shameful, something miserable, something not worthy, to be Jewish. The German people denied you the right to be a German. And now that I\u2019m an American, I\u2019ve slowly changed, but it sits in there. It sits in there. And I try not to make, any way, form or shape, something out of this background of mine, but it still hangs in there."

No to the majority of the world. I-I view the world with a degree of skepticism. Not necessarily do I condemn them anything, but somebody who is my friend has to earn that. I don\u2019t\u2014 I\u2019m not a warm person in the sense that I embrace people who happen to come into my life. I\u2019m sort of reserved and keeping a distance, and then as connections develop, we become to [known]. If you ask me how many friends do you really have, I would tell you I have one. I have lots of acquaintances, but I\u2019ve only got one friend. And he, of all people, is a German Christian, so\u2014 But just to show you, I do not make friends very easily. And that is something I have to live with. And I cannot change my personality to the degree that I suddenly become a warm, hospital-hospitable person who embraces people for their existence, for their being, without knowing anything about him."

What have you tried to overcome, and to what degree have you been successful? https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 7",
            "answer": "Well, basically\u2014 Let me think about your question. You want to know what the psychological factors are, [to do\u2014 to\u2014] in my present conditions in life. I\u2019m basically suspicious; I\u2019m very basically very careful with whom I associate. I mean, I don\u2019t mean professionally. That\u2019s something\u2014 you earn a living, you accept the people who work with you. But in my private life, 1t\u2019s rather empty. I do not easily go out with them. So those are hangovers, direct relationship. When I lived in Germany during the Nazi time, you couldn\u2019t trust anybody. You couldn\u2019t like anybody. They didn\u2019t want you to like them. So you were limited to the few Jewish family with which my mother was acquainted, and which I knew, d their children. But as a whole, the idea\u2014 For example, I don\u2019t like\u2014 I\u2019m not a good host. Let me describe this. Other people, they love\u2014 Americans, for example, born Americans. They have a saying that says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over for dinner?\u201d They just met half an hour ago. Never do that. I mean, Europeans wouldn\u2019t do that anyway, and I wouldn\u2019t do this in particular. And I am not a very gracious host. I am reticent to be a cordial, open, slap-shoulder type guy. So those are really hangovers from\u2014 little bit from my family life, because my mother was [at] about the same [trends], and so have I. I hope that sort of explains it."

Yes, it definitely has. I become calmer, and I am now in a fortunate position to have retired with a pension, which is [where] I\u2019m very grateful for, that has eased my anxieties about not having anything, not knowing where the next meal comes from, which was the case in Germany, which definitely was the case in the concentration camp, that\u2014 So to some degree, I am accepting the world today as an open opportunity, as something I can live with. Don\u2019t necessarily have to be happy all the time, but I have changed to that degree that Iam much more a https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 8 person who is accepting its presence and not constantly thinking: What if? What happened in the past, can it happen again?\u2014as I did in \u201945, when I decided to marry a Christian woman to save my children from the gas chamber. That, I would never do.

            "answer": "Well, that is a very good question. What did I tell my children? Well, I told them as much as they needed to know. I never had the problem like some survivors, that they didn\u2019t want to talk about anything that happened to them. I did. When they\u2019re about 12 or 13 years old, and they were living with us in Ohio, we\u2014 I used the occasion when their history\u2014 in school, when their history reached World War II, and I used that as an occasion and said, \u201cI want you guys to listen to something. And here is my story.\u201d And I did tell them. I\u2019m not sure they grasped everything, because it was an enormous burden on them suddenly to find out that their father was 4 years 1n prison and lived under conditions which were less than human. And so they accepted\u2014 They were shocked. They were actually shocked. Then I noticed that they began sort of ad\u2014 to admire me, you know, and saying, \u201cMy dad made it,\u201d you know. They didn\u2019t understand it wasn\u2019t only my doing, but they were sort of proud that they made it. Now I need to ask you to understand that my family in Denver, they are married\u2014 they-they are not Jews. I mean, they\u2019re Jews on a piece of paper, but that\u2019s about it, because there\u2019s also a mixed marriage, and they are not raised in the sense that they have compassion with the Jewish faith as it happens through the centuries. You know. My local daughter and her husband are very Jewish. And he\u2019s from Montreal, and was raised very Jewish, and they\u2019re much more receptive to the fact that I work in a museum, that I try to spread the word by giving speeches about my life. So in that respect, I must say that I have sort of half and half: one family who knows of, and said, \u201cOh yeah, well, my dad was-\u2014is a survivor,\u201d and then let it go; while my younger daughter is much more saying in https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 10 ROBERT BEHR page 9 pride, \u201cMy-my dad made it,\u201d you know, and tells people what-what happened to me as far as she remembers."

I feel, with-with-with my-my-my older daughter who\u2019s 49 years old, and was never very much\u2014 We were never a religious family, never, ever. So [along where] we were a mixed marriage. And so I accept that. I mean, she lives her life, and the Jewishness 1s there, she knows it of course, but it\u2019s not a big part of her life. The other one here is more Jewish, and I\u2019m proud of them, but\u2014 You see, religion has played a very small part in their lives, the kids\u2019 lives. They\u2019re not-not religious.

But there was a slogan. If somebody asked you, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d you always said, \u201cI\u2019m a German citizen of Jewish religion.\u201d So what comes first? The German citizenship. And that\u2019s the same here with us. We are Americans, we\u2019re proud of it, we believe in it, we want to be Americans, and the religion aspect is a fact you live with, and you either practice it or you don\u2019t, but it\u2019s totally secondary to your [Jew-] nationality and citizenship.

As a citizen, let me give you an example. When I applied for my visa, I was interviewed by the American consul in Berlin. And one of the (which I thought was rather stupid) question he asked me is: If there would be a war between the United States and Germany, whose side would you f-fight for? (you know) Well, obviously I wouldn\u2019t- Remember, that was in 1947, (1) shortly after the war. And I said, \u201cOf course I would fight for the Americans.\u201d So what you\u2014 What America has given me, I can give you in one sentence. That\u2019s a Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is the most motivating factor, for this immigrant, as I ever seen. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to go to Israel. They don\u2019t have a Bill of Rights. And to me, American was the epitome of a dream come true. When our ship landed in New York in February of 1947, and we entered the harbor, and there was the statue of liberty (see, it\u2019s coming back; I\u2019m beginning to cry), we all cried. We literally cried. It was the most wonderful sight\u2014 Excuse me for being sentimental, but it was something\u2014 It comes right back to me. You cannot imagine. To enter this land as a free person. My God. What did we see in New York, the first thing, was lights. Americans had lights. Everything in Germany was destroyed. It was dark. It was miserable.

I came out of the camps https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 13 in May of 1945. I had no education, no money, no home, no country. And that has shaped my whole personality. I wanted to be somebody. I wanted to have something. I wanted to belong. That is a key factor. I wanted to belong. I was looking desperately. Who-who am I? Let me give you an example. I worked for a little while in a British officers\u2019 club, being sort of a-a receptionist and one day I had the great idea. That was still in 1945, maybe November, December. And I thought, well, maybe I can enlist in the British army. Look at those guys. They got everything. They had uniform, they\u2019re respected, they had all the things I missed. So I went to one of the officers and says, \u201cCaptain, what can I do to enlist in the British army?\u201d And he said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d So I told him, and he said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And I said, \u201cIn-in\u2014 I\u2019m from Berlin.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re a German.\u201d And that is something I certainly didn\u2019t want to hear, being a German, after having just spent four years 1n a concentration camp, arrested by the very German. So I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a German.\u201d \u201cOh yeah?\u201d he said. \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d So I said, \u201cBerlin.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Berlin located?\u201d I said, \u201cIn Germany.\u201d He said, \u201cVoila. You are a German. End of story.\u201d So you see, it-it all comes back what you make [of it]. Ambition and the drive to belong. The British army didn\u2019t want me because I was a German. May I say that very honestly I certainly didn\u2019t feel like being a German after being persecuted from 1933 to \u201945. But here he was, told me, very logical, \u201cBerlin is the capital of Germany, so you\u2019re German.\u201d And so in answer to your question, it\u2019s a desire to belong and a desire to be among people who accept you for what you are, not ask about your religion or anything else. And so that what drove me. That what really drove me. I was a very lonely person with nothing. You know. My mother was still alive and\u2014 but we had nothing. We were nothing. We were constantly told that we were no good. And I wanted to be accepted. So those were the driving forces which shaped my life ever since I survived the camp."

We were sponsored by a Jewish organization, the Joint Distribution Committee, and they put us up in the Hotel Marseilles in New York. And the next couple days we were interviewed. And they had established a system where various Jewish communities in the United States, in various cities (I don\u2019t know all the details), agreed to sponsor a refugee. So when my turn came to be interviewed, they told me that number one, I can\u2019t stay in New York. For some https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 15 reason, everybody wanted to stay in New York, most of the refugees, because they felt at home or they had relatives up there. So I said, \u201cWell, all right. I don\u2019t have anybody in New York anyway. What are my choices?\u201d So they said, \u201cWell,\u201d they looked at their lists and said, \u201c\u201cYou can either go to Chicago or can go to Dallas.\u201d Had two minutes to answer that question. So, make a long story very short, I rationalized it very cleverly. I figured Chicago there are gangsters, and in Dallas there are cowboys, which are a lesser of two evils, and I wound up in Dallas. That\u2019s why I got to Dallas. And I was miserable. I was absolutely miserable. Would you be interested to know why? All right. I was miserable only because I had no money, no friends, no nothing. The Jewish community in those days were not interested in refugees or survivors. Not at all. They did it out of a sense of obligation to sponsor one or two refugees, but giving speeches or asking me how was it in the camps, not once. Not at all. Not ever. And they did their (quote, unquote) \u201cduty\u201d to sponsor somebody, and I was very lonely, very miserable. I won\u2019t go into details what I worked at. They got me a job, which was terrible. And then there was no feeling of belonging. My mother was still living in Germany and starving, \u201947, ration cards. And so I finally said, I can\u2019t live lie this. And then the Army became like a\u2014 I\u2019ve seen the soldiers. Like the British soldier I talked about, the American soldiers in Berlin, they had a good life. They belonged, they did their job, they\u2014 and so forth. And I felt, that\u2019s my answer. And I enlisted in July of 1947."

So it wasn\u2019t\u2014 There was no long-range planning anymore. I\u2019d given that up. I mean, I was no longer in a position to say, \u201cWell, when I got 18, I\u2019m going to go\u2019\u2014 I had no schooling. I was kicked out of school and was not able to get into a Jewish school.

Now, that is a question I just absolutely love, because when I start off giving my normal speeches, I always tell the audience, if they\u2019re old enough to understand, that there\u2019s actually two things to the Holocaust. One thing is the psychological, and one is the physical. Well, everybody 1s familiar with the physically: concentration camp, gas chambers, evacuations, all that. But the psychological aspect which I stress, and what I ask my audience, I make them raise their hand. What nationalities are you? They say American. Say, \u201cWhat do you feel like about America?\u201d And they usually tell you they\u2019re proud of it, blah-blah-blah.

And in September of 1935, during the Nuremberg\u2014 and the Nuremberg laws were passed, which in simple terms simply took our citizenship away, it made us residents without any rights to [go]. That was a tremendous blow to my parents. I mean, my father and my step-father both fought in World War I. We so thoroughly believed in Germany. [And] more, much more which I have no time to tell you. Suffice it to say that my parents considered themselves German first and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 11 ROBERT BEHR page 19 Jewish second. And \u201cGerman citizen of Jewish faith\u201d was the slogan we use. That, I was raised. And it was\u2014 As the laws were passed, dis-discriminatory to the Jewish faith, and 1t took away more and more of Germany itself. We were in Germany, we spoke German, we still had access to German books, but the people denied us. The people didn\u2019t want us. The very things we-we wanted to belong to said, \u201cYou may want to belong to us, but we don\u2019t want you to belong to us.\u201d So the-the-the feeling that the German citizenship and the German country itself and its people denied us, was a tremendous blow to us. In fact, to me, that was in some ways equally bad than the physical aspect, which were bad enough. But to lose one\u2019s country, for which my uncle had died in World War I, my father and biological father were both officers in World War I, fighting this country\u2014 I'll give you an example of my family. My mother had a brother who was what one commonly called a black sheep. What did you do with black sheep? You send him to America. So in October of 1913, he went to New York and lived there. A year later, not quite a year later, in Sept\u2014 in August of 1914, the war broke out. And what did this guy do? He smuggled him\u2014 gave up his job in New York, smuggled himself back on a Spanish ship to Germany, enlisted in the army, and was killed in October. So that just gives you some idea how we felt about Germany. My grand\u2014 My-my mother\u2019s father committed suicide because he could not stomach the idea that Germany had lost the war in 1918. In 1919 he killed himself. And so that this illustrates. I was young. I mean, I had not even the experience. I was growing up. But all the things my parents talked forever about what Germany, its culture, its music, its-its land, its territory, its trees. Germany is a very beautiful country. And it tells us, \u201cWe don\u2019t care how beautiful it is. You don\u2019t belong in it.\u201d And so that shaped this whole thing, the torn between the admiration of my parents versus the Nazi attitude and saying \u201cWe don\u2019t want you.\u201d Very difficult."

Now, there are Jewish people who will not set foot into Germany again because their feelings are different than mine. But mine, simply as I explained to you: Don\u2019t blame somebody for something which was happening two generations ago. [Tape 12]"

            "answer": "That\u2019s a very difficult answer for me to-to give, because it took a long time for me to be sure that things like this\u2014 You see, when I first came to America, there was still very much discrimination against blacks. There was discrimination against Jews. It was a very subtle type of discrimination. You would, for example, when you looked for housing, find an advertising that a house 1s for sale, with a quote that \u201cChristian church nearby.\u201d And those were indicator (which I learned from other people who were here much longer) that this is a sign they don\u2019t want any Jews. Universities had quotas for Jewish students. And there was a degree of anti- Semitism here. It wasn\u2019t personally. Nobody came on your street and kicked you. But it was there. There were certain class distinctions, and it took me a while to get used to that. In fact, I didn\u2019t even understand what it meant, \u201cChristian church nearby,\u201d that that meant \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody [but] white Anglo-Saxon https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 22 Protestants,\u201d you know. They weren\u2019t even sure they weren\u2019t Catholics. But those things, you slowly accept and\u2014 You got to remember that times change. America has become much more liberal, much more liberal. I mean\u2014 I\u2019Il give you a very personal example. One of my children moved in with her boyfriend. And nobody raised an eyebrow. I wasn\u2019t very happy, my wife wasn\u2019t very happy, but we are from another generation. We didn\u2019t stop them. But she didn\u2019t experience any problems. Nobody said, \u201cHow can you?\u201d And so there was a\u2014 America has become a very\u2014 much more liberal. It still isn\u2019t 100%. No country is ever 100% liberal. But America has changed much more. I mean, there are reasons for that. The Supreme Court ruling about (you know) Roe versus Wade, and you have the integration, school integration thing. So as a whole, Americans have changed to be more liberal. Doesn\u2019t mean you are liberally politically. That is a different story. I\u2019m not addressing it. I\u2019m [dressing] it as socially. And that has slowly moved me too, to the fact that I\u2019m no longer worried that a holocaust would happen here. I was in \u00b045. I said, \u201cNo country is safe from having another holocaust.\u201d And as indeed we have. We had Cambodia, we had all sorts of holocausts. But in \u201945, when I went through the .. method of protecting my children with the fake birth certificates, so to speak, that 1s gone now, because I see how America has changed. Much more\u2014 America is much more accepting things which .... 50 years were roundly condemned. And so it made me much more sure of myself. I\u2019m now no longer agonizing: Will there be a holocaust here? (you know, and\u2014) There\u2019s a book from Philip Roth which he just wrote, that Lindbergh became president, (you know) the very Lindbergh who was, deep down, a fascist. And he becomes president of the United States. It\u2019s a fiction. And he issues immediately any anti-Semitic laws. So\u2014 But that\u2019s fiction. People-people don\u2019t no longer do that. And so I\u2019m fairly secure of myself. (you know)"

            "answer": "Nationalism and patriotism can be constructive or they cannot be. I mean, if you interpret patriotism with the old saying, \u201cRight or wrong, my country,\u201d well, that\u2019s patriotism but it isn\u2019t necessarily right. You have elements in our country which consider themselves patriots, which I would not for a minute consider patriots, because they deny the very things I\u2019m proud of, (you know) like the Aryan race and those-those elements up here. But again, you can live with that, because you see, the major difference in all of this is the fact, in Germany it was government-initiated and supported. Here it is not. It comes from the bottom up, not from the top down. And that makes all the difference in the world. There still is a Supreme Court. There still are the laws on the book that if they paint a swastika on a synagogue, you can go and arrest them for defamation and that sort of thing.

            "question": "When you came to America, you had to relearn how to live in a civilized society after having had to do what you did to survive in the camp. How did that impact you, then and later in your life?",
            "answer": "The first thing I can say to this, that\u2014 about right or wrong, that I all of a sudden found myself in a society which had laws, not anti-laws but positive laws, laws which govern our life, which I may not always like or agree with it, but I came into a society where the law went from the bottom up. It was created by Congress and approved by the president. We had a society which based on law. Everything here is based on law, because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have that many lawsuits. You know. People can sue. People can try to equalize a wrong by going to the courts and saying, \u201cThis is not right.\u201d Was totally new to me. Totally new to me. I had no idea that could even be done. Now, the Germans had courts during the Nazi time. Oh, and they followed the law, except that the laws were terrible. You know. If you listened to a foreign broadcast, the judge had no choice but to condemn you to death. I mean, those are laws and laws. These laws here were based on our Constitution, which again it contains the Bill of Rights. So you come right back to the fact that living in this society took some adjusting. I mean, I really wasn\u2019t quite sure. Give you an example. When I came, I had a knife with me to\u2014 in case something was wrong. I went to the police station to register that knife. The guy said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do with that?\u201d And I said, \u201cSir, I would like to be sure that you write on my card\u2019\u2014 He said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a card of you. Why should I have a card of you?\u201d I learned suddenly, this is not a country where everything is registered and (you know) and noted down and so forth. In Germany, till today, when you move from point A to point B, you got to de-register at one police station and re-register at another one. So I-I was coming down to\u2014 when I went in Dallas, I moved once. And the first time, I went to the police and said, \u201cI want to register.\u201d (you know) https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 25 These guys were very nice. They thought they\u2019re probably dealing with some jerk who doesn\u2019t know what in the world he\u2019s talking about. But they didn\u2019t know my background or anything else. So this right or wrong becomes a very difficult thing to adopt to it, because it is\u2014 we are governed by laws. (you know) May not all like the laws, but they\u2019re there. And they\u2019re voted on. They\u2019re not arbitrarily by one dictator says, \u201cI want this to happen.\u201d And so all the laws we have went through a process of being accepted or denied. But if they are accepted, then it\u2019s a majority of something or somebody who wants these law to be existing. So that took a while to get used to it. Very difficult. Wasn\u2019t even easy.

My children know of course that I\u2019m a Holocaust survivor, and they know some of it, but in some ways they did not show the amount of curiosity. My younger daughter much more than my older one.

There are hundreds, hundreds of schoolchildren (seventh graders, eighth graders) come to the museum. Okay. They get that on their itinerary and they come in there. What I normally do with them, I give them a little quiz before I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 26 send them up to the fourth floor where the Holocaust story begins. And I usually ask them, \u201cWhat museum are you in?\u201d Half of them don\u2019t know. I ask them, \u201cWhat is a holocaust?\u201d And you would really be surprised. These children are not particularly oriented, don\u2019t even know. Said, \u201cGive me another word for \u2018holocaust.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s not very difficult. You don\u2019t have to say \u201cgenocide.\u201d That\u2019s much too complicated. Say \u201cmass murder.\u201d That\u2019s what it really is. And I\u2019m constantly amazed. But they don\u2019t ask any questions. Neither did my kids, even though they had an in-house capability to find out. (you know) They listened. My daughter came and the first voices up there, she came and listened to it, you know, and she congratulated me on my good speech and so forth. But did she ask any questions in detail? Their lives are so full, and they are\u2014 their lives are so engrossed in their daily activities, personally, I\u2019m afraid they don\u2019t even want to know. They know the basic outlines and they know what happened. Details: Did I have enough to eat? And if I did, what did I get to eat? No. I try to tell them sometimes that our staple food was something\u2014 was barley. They didn\u2019t even know what barley was. And so instead of asking, \u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s barley?\u201d you know, and \u201cHow come?\u201d it is \u201cAh, mm-hm, ah.\u201d So it is\u2014 My children unfortunately did not\u2014- When they got older, sometimes they did. But then they were married, then they had their own problems, they lived in their own world. And so no. The answer basically: My children\u2014 Now, it\u2019s strictly personal. My children did not demonstrate a degree of curiosity I was hoping they would do. For example, both of them hate history. And now the Holocaust\u2014 you cannot understand the Holocaust, you know something about history, World War I, the loss, the Versailles Treaty, you know, unless you know sometimes. And I was hoping that they would ask me some question: How did a Hitler come into power? Well, Pll be honest with you. They never did. I shoved it down their throat because I made them, but they did not, out of their own volition, come and say, \u201cHey, Dad, tell us. What happened in Germany? How come they elected Hitler?\u201d You know. They didn\u2019t.

I look at their faces, I see them, nobody cries, nobody looks shook. I mean, I-I\u2014 they- they listen to hear the words, but the depth of this tragedy takes an adult. It really does take an adult.

There 1s a\u2014 https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 12 ROBERT BEHR page 28 There is a sign at the Holocaust Museum, \u201cRemember.\u201d You know. It\u2019s on the outside when you come in. I\u2019m not sure they remember very much. They-they will go home and they will know there are tragedies. They are probably more impressed to some degree of what they see there, [and] what they hear from a survivor. But that\u2019s probably not fair, because I don\u2019t always know. I just have the impression\u2014 For example, we recommend, the museum recommends that a visit to the museum should be no less than 2\u2019 hours, to walk through the Holocaust story. When you see kids coming back in 45 minutes, and many do, you get an idea of the perception which these kids have. They walk through because they were told to do it. They look at some of the pictures. There\u2019s nobody there to explain it to them. (you know) We\u2014 The type of information I convey to you now, they don\u2019t have the benefit. These are objects which they see. Most [of] the time when you ask them what was impressed you most, were the shoes which were there, but is physical. The-the-the wagon, the railroad car, that\u2019s physical. But when you\u2014 For example, there is one where, from 1933 to 1945, it\u2019s a rolling thing on a TV screen, where all the anti-Jewish laws are passed, which to me is the most frightening exhibit, not only because I lived there, but if I would see this from another country\u2014let\u2019s say, a country in Africa which has a dictator, Idi Amin, who had passed one law after another, if he\u20141if he didn\u2019t kill them outright. You go by there, that doesn\u2019t mean and it doesn\u2019t sink in. Each law is a tragedy in itself. And you have to [take] the time, and you have to [do] the willingness to read this and comprehend. What does that mean, that you cannot use public transportation? Kids would say, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have any public in Sheboygan anyway, So what\u2019s the big tragedy?\u201d You know. Not realizing that Berlin was much, much bigger, and we had to go to work. We were forced to go to work. We couldn\u2019t use public transportation. So the perception is difficult. And it depends much on the age and the preparation of the children. There are exceptions. There are some schoolchildren who come who are well prepared. The story of Anne Frank, for example, is one of the wonderful examples where kids take an interest."

As far as German Jews are concerned, the Nazis only transported three groups of Germans. First of all, the majority were old people, old people. The Nazis literally, in their conference in Wannsee, in the protocols you will read: We don\u2019t need to gas them. We\u2019re just going to starve them to death, and they\u2019re going to\u2014 they\u2019re old and feeble. No use to wasting time, money and trains with them. They\u2019re going to die. So that was one group. The other group were the mixed, the younger people, were those of mixed marriages. And a third group were the one of decorated officers, the families of decorated World War I officers. So that it didn\u2019t surprise me because I knew that that\u2019s the only reason we were sent there, is because of my stepfather\u2019s achievement during World War I. And so I had hope [to survive]. And my youth helped me to master this. You cannot really understand it until one knows about. Theresienstadt was a very difficult thing. It was \u201cHitler\u2019s gift to the Jews,\u201d so it was by no means as bad as some of the concentration camp that had gas chambers and so forth, and\u2014or Auschwitz, where they worked people to death. We were not worked to death. We starved to death if possible. And the atmosphere there was different. It was not as bad, I would be lying if I say that, although it was bad enough as it was. And the\u2014 My youth enabled me, among all these old people, to be something different, which the-the administration of the ghetto made use of. They were\u2014 As far as German Jews are concerned, there were not that many young people. They were mostly old. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 13 ROBERT BEHR page 34 Now, the camp was dominated by Czechoslovakia Jews.

So that posed a very difficult question, and I solved it by just escaping it and saying I\u2019m Swiss. So everything was fine. The Swiss were neutrals, nobody hated them, nobody loved them, so there was no problem at all. But I did indeed live through that period, until I got in the military. And then it stopped.

And these were both prisoners. That is like in today\u2019s prison where you have gangs. I mean, if you\u2014 1f you expand that, you had one group of German Jews and you had one group of Czech Jews. The Czech Jews ran the ghetto, no question, more or less very well. They had of course all the good positions, one of which being\u2014 There were several of them.

Suddenly there was a little tiny country with a bunch of refugees who resettled, and they beat the hell out of\u2014 out of the vastly superior (numerically at least) nations. And I almost felt that the attitude of the Americans began to change. There was a certain degree of respect. May not be love and admiration, but admiration did play in it. They said, \u201cMy God, look at those guys.\u201d You know, Moshe Dayan with his black eye patch. You remember that? These became heroes, folk heroes. And Americans are very attuned to people who do good-\u2014 do- do brave and good things, and become their\u2014 Americans are not ignoring this. [They never say], \u201cEh, what\u2019\u2014 No. Americans admire this. And suddenly there is https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 52 this tiny little state which is in everybody\u2019s mouth. And-and Israel began to get admired. And I think that a lot had to do with the change of attitude, even politically. I mean, our government supports Israel, (you know) and-and financially, militarily, and commercial\u2014 economically. So this was did something which none of us could have ever achieved without it. That was a past. That was gone. [You ....] here. So forget the Holocaust. That\u2019s fine. You\u2019re here now, and now this war. And the victory of that war, in my personal opinion, electrified the American people. It really did. And from then on, so many things changed of the political and social and economic and military attitude of the United States towards Israel. It\u2019s remarkable. And so I think that\u2019s\u2014that was the trigger."

(you know) It put Israel and the Jewish people on the map. And maybe rightly or wrongly, we were associated. (you know) We were Jewish, and so there were the Jews winning that war, and even though we didn\u2019t personally fight in it, we supported it, and the people began to get respect. And that respect it gave towards the Israeli people transferred itself to some degree to the Jewish communities, not an individual necessarily, but Jewish organizations, and there was interface between Christian religions and rabbis and so forth.

The formal interrogation\u2014 I screened whether the person was in the SS or wasn\u2019t. He\u2014- The Americans and the British, but I\u2019m sure the Americans, created a questionnaire where all the Nazi organizations and subdivisions were listed. And people had to fill those out. So there were some organizations [in it] were nominally Nazi but they weren\u2019t. Others were. And so my job was to flush out who did what to whom during the war. And you got to remember that the be- the worst thing about the thing is that there weren\u2019t any Nazis. That whole German people unanimously and individually decided, \u201cMe? Never Nazi. Him, you go to ask.\u201d (you know) And it was terrible. They just absolutely will not say, \u201cYeah, I made a mistake. I followed him. I believed in him.\u201d Very seldom did you find it. You find it in literature. But face to face? There\u2019s an excellent movie out called Downfall. And that movie is the last week of Hitler\u2019s life. And it introduces the person who was instrumental in furnishing the information, which was Hitler\u2019s secretary. Now, she lived with him day in and day out. In her introduction in that movie, she said she had no idea what the\u2014 what the Nazis did with the Jewish people. She knew that the Nazis didn\u2019t like them; they knew that they deprived them of work, and-and some https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 15 ROBERT BEHR page 61 degree of comfort. But that they actually evacuated them, she knew that too. That was only to work on road construction or whatever the case may have been. But that they put them in the death camp by the thousands, she never knew. And now, you\u2019re going to believe this? She was Hitler\u2019s secretary, [Kristol/Traudl Junge]. And she said that outright in the movie, (you know) after it was [found], and\u2014 So that\u2019s the attitude you\u2019 ll find. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d And then you have mitigating circumstances, if I may say that. Every civil servant in Germany during the time had to belong to the Nazi Party. All schoolteachers were civil servants. There were mass admission to the party, because they wanted to keep their job, so they had to apply. Could you condemn those? You\u2014 Can you put them in the same bucket? So what I\u2019m trying to say 1s, there are various degrees of guilt. (you know) If somebody joins a party in order to keep his job and feed his family, well, I\u2019m not so sure I want to put him in the same bucket as some SS guard who beats up Jews for fun. So yes, they were both Nazis, but within the party\u2014 And one needs to be objective about this, because there are people, Jewish people in particular, who condemn them right out. \u201cThey\u2019re all bad.\u201d Well, that isn\u2019t the case. And so I always try to judge the person by what duties he perform or she perform within the Nazi organization, because some of them really, they were just pushed in there and they had nothing to do with, other than being nominally party members.

But the work I was doing required a clearance, a secret clearance, later a top secret clearance. And that could only be given to American citizens. So the Army shipped me and my wife and-\u2014 to the States to get naturalized. It was a wonderful moment. I\u2014 We-we were naturalized at different times. I was nat- naturalized in 1951, hers was later. And when you raise your hand and you swear to be an American citizen, and to obey the Constitution, which was different than the Germans, who swore an oath of obedience to a person (Hitler), well, this one was a document, which was the foundation for American democracy. And you swear to uphold that. It was a very proud moment. It was a very, very proud moment. I was there with-with a witness who swore that he knew me, that I was an upstanding citizen. What he didn\u2019t tell the judge there was that the met me two hours before for the first time. And he was a military sergeant who was directed to come with me and swear to my honest upbringing and honest character.

It was\u2014 It was something\u2014 https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 16 ROBERT BEHR page 66 And of course the first thing you do, like all naturalized citizen (I don\u2019t know anybody who didn\u2019t if they were old enough), you want a passport. You know. The citizen oath and the document you get, which is a very nice formal type document that on such and such a date you, Robert Behr, were naturalized by Southern District Court of New York, and so forth, that was fine. But what you really wanted was a passport. So the first thing I did, I applied for a passport. And I was so proud when that document came. Now I really felt I was a citizen. With- with the oath and the document, I knew I was; but feeling it took that little blue book in my hand and saying \u201cAmerican citizen.\u201d And that was a page in there where it says that all persons having contact ... are requested to assist Mr. Behr, Robert Behr. I mean, it was just-just a piece of paper, but it was tremendously meaningful. It was\u2014 And you\u2019ll find if you talk to other naturalized citizen, they all want passport, even though they have no intention of traveling, but they want a passport. (you know) It has a tremendous meaning. It still has today. I\u2019m over in Paris, or in Berlin, and I see the American embassy with a flag. It does something to me. It-it\u2019s not just \u201cOh, I have to go in here, and it\u2019s another security and I have to go through this and this.\u201d This is my country. (you know) And even though we\u2019re not always universally liked, people don\u2019t even like Americans, at least per se, but for individuals they usually have a great deal respect. But when you see the flag and you have that passport, talk about belonging, you really do. And you feel it, and it\u2019s there. And I don\u2019t think I exaggerate. It\u2019s true for me, but Ill bet you dollars to donuts that\u2019s true for many, many immigrants. It gives you something which is\u2014 Why do we stand up when we see the flag? Respect, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just a piece of cloth. The Supreme Court said you can burn it. Nothing will happen to you. I too-totally disagree with that decision. It\u2019s not freedom of speech. To me, that\u2019s much more. People who take America for granted do not impress me. People have died for what we are today. From the Revolutionary War, to the 1812 War, to the Civil War\u2014you know all that as well as I do. But people have died for that flag.

And in order to do that, I\u2019ve got to have an intellectual background. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 17 ROBERT BEHR page 72 My wife is European, I\u2019m European. I\u2019m not even sure. I\u2019ve often thought about: Would I be happy with an American girl? And I don\u2019t mean anybody in particular. I have my doubts. Not that American ladies or women are worse, but they have different\u2014 their upbringing, their characteristics. They\u2019re not better or they\u2019re not worse; they\u2019re just different. And without going into details, I found so many ladies I met who are married, good marriages and everything, but there\u2019s a difference between them and a European woman. And again I want to stress, it\u2019s neither better nor worse. It\u2019s just different. Culturally, education-wise, habit-wise, you know, that sort of thing. (So, I hope I answered that.)"

            "answer": "Choice. Well, choice, you know, is a very broad range of things. You have material choices (you want to buy something, you want to buy this television set or that television set), you want to\u2014 it can be spiritually, you want to cho\u2014 you want to choose that lady over that lady. So choice is a very partial endeavor. And it goes back to what I normally do before I make a choice. If I can, if I\u2019m rational enough, I analyze what the options are. I analyze a little bit. If it\u2019s a material thing, I look at what other people write about a TV set; or if it\u2019s a choice of a job, then you ask yourself, will I be happy in it? So choice 1s a process of evaluation. And you can do it in writing, which sometimes helps. You sit down and get your thoughts, and then you reorganize it and say: What is the best outcome if my- if I make choice A, choice B, or choice C? If you\u2014 If you spontaneously act to make a choice, very often it\u2019s the wrong one. (you know) It\u2019s not whether you want a hamburger or a cheeseburger. That isn\u2019t very difficult. But when it comes to human beings, when it comes to jobs, when it comes to psychological things, then choice is something you need to treat very carefully. And I do that. I try to be no spontaneous but selective and analytical, and then I make my choice. Doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s the right one, but at least I try."

            "answer": "Well, choice in a ghetto is very, very small, because there were\u2014 usually weren\u2019t much options you have. And there was not much you can evaluate it, because you knew what you wanted. You wanted to survive, that means you got to have something to eat, (you know) and so forth. When the war was over, and when I began to enter life, then the\u2014the process of analyzing choice started. I really did not have, in my young life before and after the camps, did I have the wisdom to use choice as an analytical incentive\u2014only after the war. Should I go to America? Would it\u2014 Was that the right decision? Should I go into the military? (you know) Those are choices which impact your life. And so it wasn\u2019t just survival. It was now the future. And so choice for me is an analytical process which I do as best I can. (Quit writing.) [room tone] [End of Interview]"
