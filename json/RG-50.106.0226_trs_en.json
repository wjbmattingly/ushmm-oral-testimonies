I mean not that there was anything unlikeable about these other people. But maybe they thought they would have a better chance at surviving. And Marc was very weak and so he was in this, what they called a hospital. But it wasn\u2019t and there was no medicine or care. But this Dr. Rusa was in charge and he called Marc and told him to please come in and he would help take care of him. And so then he came to Marc. I don\u2019t know how many days later, a few days later maybe, and said Marc get ready to leave because the guards are going to come and make a selection. ",

That\u2019s what his name would have been. I said nothing doing. He said I hate you when he gets older for naming him Samuel Samuels, although it strangely enough Marc was, my son Steve was helping out, he was an assistant to a librarian at Brandeis and he came across the name Samuel Samuels.

That doesn\u2019t even sound possible but he wasn\u2019t joking either. But I refused to name him Samuel with the last name of Samuels. So we called him Steven for that reason. And then Steven.
