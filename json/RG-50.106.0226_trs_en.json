Carol: But as a matter of fact, an interesting also an interesting situation is especially during the war when we were married at the end of the 50s, we didn\u2019t know whether to buy German products or not. A lot of Jews were not doing it. In fact I even came across someone recently who won\u2019t buy at Trader Joe. I don\u2019t\u2019 know if you have a Trader Joe in your neighborhood. They will not buy a British, German goods and so Marc said that well the state of Israel buys its buses and trucks and a lot of their Volkswagens from Germany so not that he was suggesting that we https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marc Samuels 44 July 25, 2014 not buy from Germany. But it seems to be that that phase is over now. And Germany is one of Israel\u2019s good friends. They don\u2019t have very many friends in Europe any more, or even in China. There is a lot of anti-Semitism. And so \u2014 ",
                " I get that sub \u2014 Carol: Yes, Marc said that Germany didn\u2019t suffer enough. The Germans didn\u2019t suffer enough. And they didn\u2019t. They just walked home after the war. Only a few of them were hung at the Eichmann trial and a few other places. But they didn\u2019t suffer enough. ",

That\u2019s what his name would have been. I said nothing doing. He said I hate you when he gets older for naming him Samuel Samuels, although it strangely enough Marc was, my son Steve was helping out, he was an assistant to a librarian at Brandeis and he came across the name Samuel Samuels. Then he came across the middle initial S in the middle. Samuel S Samuels. And then eventually he found out that the guy\u2019s name was Samuel, Samuel, Samuels. That doesn\u2019t even sound possible but he wasn\u2019t joking either. But I refused to name him Samuel with the last name of Samuels. So we called him Steven for that reason. And then Steven. Jonas which was the brother who was killed in Auschwitz, who gave him this crust of bread, gave Marc this crust of bread and then was killed. And then, oh yes he was https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Marc Samuels 45 July 25, 2014 beaten up and they took his boots away. I don\u2019t know if Marc mentioned that to you. Took his boots away and then they beat him up. And then he was gassed or whatever they do."

And this goes on and on. People who invite you which is very nice but enough is enough. So I didn\u2019t, but I did go to school at night. I didn\u2019t go to, I didn\u2019t graduate college because my parents just didn\u2019t have the money. My father was divorced and their parents were divorced so they had their separate families. So it took me about ten years or more, 12 years to get my bachelor\u2019s degree at the University of Pittsburgh when we were in Washington, Pennsylvania. And then we moved and so we were in the Springfield area. And I went to the University of Massachusetts and I finished my degree. Oh yes, I got a degree from the University of Pittsburgh in English and I got a master of arts in teaching at the University of Massachusetts which is now a very good state school. And then I had nothing to do when we went to Connecticut. Willimantic Connecticut, Emanuel center. So I got another degree, a bachelor of fine arts this time in graphic design. So I\u2019ve kept myself busy at night but not to get too involved with his work. "
