Well, the disgrace, the humiliation of going to school with kids who are a year younger than you are, was so devastating that I wanted to run away from home. But when you're 16 years old, where you going to run? So I remembered that a couple years prior to that, my mother\u2019s brother, my uncle, visited his family, and he came from New York, and he stayed in my mother\u2019s apartment. And when he saw the housekeeper bring to my bed in the morning and in the evening, warm milk and cookies, he said to my mother, you are ruining that boy, he\u2019II never amount to anything. You better send him with me to u -- to the United States. So now that I wanted to run away from home because of the humiliation of being left back 1n school, what do I do? I write my uncle. Now, I didn\u2019t think at the time that I would be able to get a visa as quickly as I did, but my uncle got busy and prepared the necessary affidavits, and he send them through HIAS to Kovno, and one day I got a call from HIAS Kovno that they received the affidavits and the papers, and that the American counsel would like to see me. Well, I went to Kovno to meet the American counsel. And as you recall there was a depression in the United States in 1936 and the American counsel had like 17 visas to grant for the whole country. But when he saw my application, he figured I am not going to be a burden on the state because I have an uncle who 1s going to take care of me, I\u2019m not going to take anybody else\u2019s job. So he grants me the visa immediately. Now frankly, I wasn\u2019t ready to go that soon. But having put my uncle to all the trouble of preparing all the necessary affidavits and -- and all my friends knew that I had wa -- a visa to the United State. It is -- 1t wasn't feasible for me to back out at that particular point in time. So I came to the United States and fortunately, I survived. If I had not failed Lithuanian and Latin, and if I didn\u2019t run away from Lithuania, I might have been one of the six million."

I didn\u2019t even know what the word down was. And so I had to prepare a bid and calculate the cost of the materials, and I start calling around to find out about the price of down, and where do you get that? Well, basically you had the Yellow Pages, and you open up the Yellow Page, and you look f -- f -- under down for manufacturers on down, and we had to utilize a hundred percent down. When I called the suppliers and I ask them for hundred percent down, they said there is no such thing as hundred percent down. Hundred percent down contains probably 10 percent little feathers. Well, I said my specification calls for a hundred percent down, I can\u2019t use little feathers. Well, they said, you\u2019re not going to find anybody that makes hundred percent down, per se. And so anyhow, I was able to get a price on -- be so-called hundred percent down and we submitted a bid to the government and we got the contract. And it was one of the first contracts where I got myself familiarized with the term down. But there were many other contracts which we received at the time. We made bandoliers, where the soldiers kept their shells or whatever."

I think the child was born in \u201946, so -- and I was not able to communicate with my brother directly, so it seems that all the letters which I sent to him, and the return address which he sent to me, went through a third party. He was afraid that if the Russians find out that he has a brother in the United States, a capitalist, whatever, that he will lose his job because at one point he had a very good job in Poinyavich right after the war, but then somebody said, you know, his father was a capitalist and he has a brother capitalist and so he got fired, because his brother is a capitalist and his father was a capitalist. So he was afraid to disclose that he has a brother in the United States. However, in subsequent years, I sent him packages. Again, not directly to him, but through a third party, and he would be able to barter the packages for either food, or for whatever else, or sell it, and that has enabled him to live a better life than otherwise. So with the help of the packages which I sent him regularly for many years, he subsequently is a very capable man, spoke Lithuanian fluently, spoke Russian fluently, spoke Yiddish fluently, all these things which I couldn\u2019t do, he was able to do very well. And so he got a -- a very significant job with the Russian government and he was in charge of food distribution for the -- for Wilna and it\u2019s surrounding. Well, that was a very big job because with food you cou -- in those days, you could trade and help people in many ways. The story goes, supposedly, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true or not, but when the president of Lithuania, the prime minister had a birthday party and he needed vodka or food or whatever, he had to get permission from my brother to get these supplies. So he had a fairly good job, and then he was in charge also of their hotels which -- which were built to cater to foreign dignitaries. So that he had occasion to go to all the Russian -- to Czechoslovakia, to some of the other Russian countries, whatever, and learn how to run a -- an outs -- what I would call a hotel that caters to dignitaries. And he had a fairly good life. The first time I actually met -- saw my brother since I left home in 1936 was in 1988. That\u2019s 52 years later. And I met my brother in Israel. It seems that a Maccabee team from Lithuania came to Israel to participate in the games and my brother was very much involved with the soccer team in Lithuania, and so he came, he got permission to travel with the team to Israel for the soccer games. And that is the first time that I met -- I saw my brother after 52 years."

And I finally convinced him in 1988 to move to Israel, because he had such a good job in Lithuania. He had a car, he had a dacha, he had computers, he had everything. And here he has to give it all up and move to Israel where his children don\u2019t speak the language, where -- well, he spoke some Hebrew because he went to a Hebrew high school, but it\u2019s starting a whole new life."

They had a daughter, they got married and before you knew there was a baby. And the other -- the only other thing he tells me is that he was able to reclaim my father\u2019s home. And he then sold the house, which belonged to my father, and no sooner did he sell the house that that money became devalued. That he told me."

            "answer": "Well, it had -- it -- obviously it\u2019s a very central part of my life. This is why I am so committed to Israel. This is why I am committed to the importance of the state of Israel, because it\u2019s my view that if we had an Israel at the time, we had a place that would have admitted Jews, maybe my parents could have been saved, and my parents wou -- with not only my parents, with my grandparents, my uncles, my cousins, everybody else that was killed by the Lithuanians in 1941. So I have done a number of things to memorialize it. One of the things which I always hoped, that I would be able to bring my parents over, and to give them the type -- the kind of lifestyle that they gave me when I was a kid. And obviously that was not to be. So I got involved in building a geriatric center. And I felt, while I may not be able to take care of my parents, I will be able to take care of other parents, who will be able to finish their years in a home where they could -- are surrounded by their own people, and they would spend the rest of their life in dignity, and -- so we build this communities -- this geriatric center, which is called the Gurwin Jewish geriatric center. It\u2019s in Commack, Long Island, and it 1s an -- if I say so myself, an outstanding geriatric center. It has 460 beds, it has another 120 daycare patients, and it has apartments with assisted living for 200 units. And so I have devoted a lot of time, effort and energy to build this geriatric center, and to maintain it in a style which would be a credit to the Jewish community."
