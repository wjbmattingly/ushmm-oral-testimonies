So I was there for one night, for one night and I said to myself I don\u2019t like it here and I\u2019m not interested in this and I\u2019m not going to stay here. So I, I sent a telegram to my father and I wrote send me money. Or I\u2019m going to do something. Well they telegraphed me money and I didn\u2019t say anything to the owner of that place where I was supposed to work but he knew something was not kosher and he was watching every move I made. So he seen me going to the post office, picking up that, the money and I didn\u2019t even take my clothes and I run to the station. And the first train was coming just as I got to the station, the first train came in. But I see that the owner of that store, he was behind me and so I don\u2019t know if he seen me or not but he was watching more if I step in the train or not. But there was a, I seen there a big garbage disposal there and I jumped in, not to be seen. And wait til the train moved away and after he was gone, I got out of there, tried to clean myself up a little bit. Anyhow, it worked and I got into the next train and then from there to Mannheim. I mentioned Mannheim. There was my brother at that time. He found a trade. And so I figured that was on the way home. Was staying there for a day or two and then I went back home. And my father asked me, what would you have done, if you wouldn\u2019t have us send the money? Because I said at that time, send me money or I\u2019m going to do something. So I said nothing. And that was the end of that."

We were, they met. To give us an idea about how things going to be in Palestine. And we were all sure that they\u2019re going to send us to Palestine. And they told us so too but I was one of the last ones, the newest ones who come to this place. So the way I was, so we let, give me one moment please. Yes, oh yeah.

We ran out of everything because we were several weeks on the sea. And so I volunteered to go to the machine room and took care of the ovens there because I knew you get a little better food there whatever. And then when we came to Haifa and there was a big ocean liner standing there. It was supposed to bring us to whole lot. And one of the British islands there, Cyprus yeah. To Cyprus. And so little by little they transferred us to that ocean liner. It was called Patcific, Patria. Was called Patria. And then all of a sudden nobody really wanted to go but we didn\u2019t have no choice. So then the Hagenah did some things. They brought some explosives with the food that they loaded. And they told everybody who was on that boat, not everybody was transferred yet. Maybe were transferred I would say about 500 people and altogether we were 900. So what happened was yeah, they told us we should go on deck in the morning. Go to the, on deck there is a meeting so I said I\u2019m going to sleep a little longer. And then all of a sudden I heard a boom and I thought it was a bomb. That is over here something not 100 percent kosher so I was running up to the deck. And on my way up I felt already I had to hold on, on the railings because the ship was leaning to the side. And then I came up to, soon I came up on top there. I lost my balance and I slipped to the other side of the \u2014 and which was a little bit under water already. So I had no choice. I didn\u2019t know how to swim but I jumped in the water. I had no choice. And some fellow seen me. He was in the water too and he seen me that I\u2019m struggling. So he went behind me and he pushed me, kept on pushing me to the little boat they have which came to \u2014 they didn\u2019t come close to the ocean liner because they figured if something is going to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hugo Herzog 21 March 6, 2014 happen, something going to explode better to stay away from there. So everybody who got out of there had to swim a little bit. Yeah. So got there on that boat and that was in fact ok with me and we kept to a big, a big hole there. How you call it. I forget. And we got clothes there and we got food there. That\u2019s the Jewish Agency, they took care of everything. And the British, they watched us like a hawk."

And we were there. And then one morning everybody, they got everybody out to Atlit, even the ones who are supposed to go to Cyprus. But then the British came one morning and they got them out, the rest of them. They had their names. They got them out and they rejected so they had they were using sticks and some of the guys there, the people there, they threw their clothes away so then they got, they considered that. They were standing there without clothes, without anything. But they took them out anyhow. And I was in Atlit for about four months. I would say I didn\u2019t have such a bad time there because the food was excellent. I was a volunteer. This time in the kitchen.

So naturally they didn\u2019t want me to go. They wanted to go people from the kibbutz who are there for a long time. But they told them if you go to the army, you go to the box. The box that means that\u2019s the part who stays in Palestine, doesn\u2019t go out of the country. And that\u2019s because at that time, the war was going on and didn\u2019t .

So I said to myself, I\u2019m going to take a chance. You know I had no rights. So anyhow, how do I get there, to Germany. You know from Italy. You know, well I think that\u2019s the best bet. I took the -- a bicycle and I took off. And I went to Illingen. I figured https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hugo Herzog 25 March 6, 2014 maybe I\u2019d see him there. But he wasn\u2019t there. So I asked some people and they told me that he went to Munich. I don\u2019t know what he did in Munich but he\u2019s going to come back and so I was waiting there two or three days and then I decided I have to go back. Yeah. Otherwise I\u2019m going to get in bigger trouble. So on the way back, I stopped near Frankfurt. I stopped there and I says look you have come all the way down here. It took you two days and you get there. Now I\u2019m not going to leave until I know really what\u2019s going on with my brother. So I turned around and I went back to Illingen. And we\u2019re not talking about from one corner to the other. That\u2019s about 150 kilometers or something like this. So and the people there are very friendly. They always want to be with us, so I have no problem to stay with anybody there overnight. Sure enough, a day later my brother shows up. Yes, I was so lucky. I said, look maybe we can arrange, that at that time, the Jewish Altrits [ph] you know the arranged to illegally deport some survives. They brought them to Palestine. Somehow, I don\u2019t know but I had the same chance. To bring my brother over. He says no he\u2019s going to go to the states. I says all right. So I went back to my unit and the camp commander happened to be a Jew too. And so I got a court martial and I forgot already what it was but it was not easy but it was only on paper. And that was the end of it so I was there for another few months. Then I went back. I was discharged, kept to, I had suit, a British suit and some money. Not too much. I think was like a hundred dollars something like this tops. And they let us go. And I said that to myself. I\u2019m not going to go to the kibbutz any more. I go to Tel Aviv. So I went to Tel Aviv first in, I also had some money for a hotel for a week or so and was looking for a job."

So but that didn\u2019t last very long because they went bankrupt for one reason or another. And after that I was working for the British. They had on the north side of Tel Aviv, they had a camp with trucks. And those trucks they went out every morning to pick up the Middle East mail which was distributed by Jewish, not only Jewish but Arabs too. And I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hugo Herzog 26 March 6, 2014 slept in that camp because I ran out of money and I had a little tent there where I slept.

And that\u2019s what I did. And so I was working there for about three months. And then I, one of the guys which I picked up, he says why don\u2019t you come one evening?
