And Mr. Simonson is a minister and I\u2122m going to let him talk about what got him to this count ry, where he lived, where he was born and I will start now.

            "answer": "My name is J-Juergen Simonson. I come from Germany. My father was a judge in Germany. His parents had been Jewish and then converted to the Christian faith in the last century. But, under Nazi laws we\u2122re regarded as Jews and so was my father, who was married to an Aryan, and so I was considered a mishling -- a 50 per cent Jew or Aryan, whichever way you take it. We were in a small town in east Germany, where my father was working as a judge and then when Hitler came in, in \u201a33 -- he was dismissed as judge in 1935 and liv ed in -- in this small town called Forst, until 1938. But because life was more difficult for somebody with a Jewish background in a small place, where everybody knew you, they were beginning to look for a move to a bigger place, where they might be more anonymous."

Which of course was awfu l sh-shock to me. So -- my class teacher was very embarrassed about it. I left immediately. My parents had gone to Dresden -- because my father\u2122s sister lived in Dresden -- to look for somewhere to live, just at that very moment. And I was being looked after by a niece. And in the af ternoon, I went to the acting headmaster to see what I should do and was told that he was resting, he could not see me. I me an -- this, sort of -- so typical, this lacking the courage of their convictions, didn\u2122t want to be involved.

And, until \u201a42, I went to that school, had very good school friends and even managed to do my -- take my matric in 1942. I\u2122ll come back to that in a moment. I just want to mention that two years ago I was back in East Germany, with a Christian group, we were -- we were visiting some churches right on the Polish border.

It had been quite a thriving factory place, so -- in -- before \u201a33, in the early days of Hitler. And went round the place to identify my school and one or two other places. Went back to the station, had a few minutes to spare. Went back, waited at the station for a moment. Walked down station roat and remembered that one of my school friends used to live there and he -- his father had a agricultural pl ace, shop. And I was totally amazed that the place was still there, with the same name, Lishgut. So I walked in, the daughter-in-law was in the shop and said, \ufb01Yes, my father-in-law is here, I\u2122ll go call him.\ufb02 And he was out in the yard, I went out and said, \ufb01Hello, could I speak --\ufb02.

Then, of course, the critical time came in \u201a44, when things were pretty desperat e, sort of, in the west and in the east. And at this point, mishlings were also being called up, but not into the armed forces, but into the Tut Organization. The Tut Organization was a -- run by one of Hitler\u2122s ministers, to be engaged in emergency work, for instance, the building of the Atlantic wall and the repair of bombed railway stations, lines and all that sort of thing, in east and west. So we were not soldiers, but we were sort of -- in fact, we were regarded as second class citizens. We didn\u2122t wear a uniform, we just wore an armband which said, Tut Organization. And we were made -- made up of people with my background, political prisoners and also minor criminals. A queer mixture of people. And when was it? April \u201a44, I said good-bye to my mother, I did not know what was going to happen to her in Dresden. Obviously we had no real contact with my fa ther in England. I didn\u2122t know 9 where I was going to land up, they didn\u2122t tell us, we were just loaded onto a train in Dresden and eventually we realized that we were on our way to France. And we\u2122re then sort of detailed to work on railway sites that had been bombed, to repair them -- very often, with time bombs going out -- going off at place-places. A nd that went on til September -- from April \u201a44 to September \u201a44. Mainly in the Paris area. Again, we were subject to quite a few air raids, but survived. And then there were four -- one, two, three, four of us -- five of us, I\u2122m sorry -- who realized that one day this train would be dur -- and this was all during the allies invasion. The allies were sort of advancing, we were slowly being withdrawn and we knew that one day we would return to Germany and then of course, what was going to happen then? Especially towards the end of the war. We had no idea. So we had determined that if there was the slightest opportunity, we would jump off the train and try to fi nd the French Resistance movement."

And we were all taken down to the south of France to be repatriated to our various countries, but of course, they couldn\u2122t repatriate us. So we we re eventually -- the Jews didn\u2122t want us, because we weren\u2122t proper Jews. So we -- there was an organization called Free Germany, which was really a -- a Communist organization, we landed up there. And we were indoctrinated to learn about Stalin and Marx and Lenin and all the rest of it.
