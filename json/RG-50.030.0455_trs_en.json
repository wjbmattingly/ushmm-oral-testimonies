            "question": "Now today, I\u2019m speaking with Juergen Simonson in a town called Ibthorpe in England. The date is the 28th of March, 1998. And Mr. Simonson is a minister and I\u2019m going to let him talk about what got him to this country, where he lived, where he was born and I will start now. Mist -- in this country, you\u2019re called mister, even thought you\u2019re ordained, is that right?",

            "answer": "My name is J-Juergen Simonson. I come from Germany. My father was a judge in Germany. His parents had been Jewish and then converted to the Christian faith in the last century. But, under Nazi laws we\u2019re regarded as Jews and so was my father, who was married to an Aryan, and so I was considered a mishling -- a 50 percent Jew or Aryan, whichever way you take it. We were in a small town in east Germany, where my father was working as a judge and then when Hitler came in, in \u201833 -- he was dismissed as judge in 1935 and lived in -- in this small town called Forst, until 1938. But because life was more difficult for somebody with a Jewish background in a small place, where everybody knew you, they were beginning to look for a move to a bigger place, where they might be more anonymous."

            "answer": "My memories are that I went to this -- to this school in small town as second grade school and my main and most painful memory is that -- well, I noticed that for some time, my school friends distanced themselves from me. I used to walk with them to school and then there came a time when they said they wouldn\u2019t want to walk with me any more."

And one day, after break, I went back to my classroom and there on the notice board, written with chalk, it said, \u201cThe -- the Juda mus game.\u201d The Jew must be out. Which of course was awful sh-shock to me. So -- my class teacher was very embarrassed about it. I left immediately. My parents had gone to Dresden -- because my father\u2019s sister lived in Dresden -- to look for somewhere to live, just at that very moment. And I was being looked after by a niece. And in the afternoon, I went to the acting headmaster to see what I should do and was told that he was resting, he could not see me. I mean -- this, sort of -- so typical, this lacking the courage of their convictions, didn\u2019t want to be involved. So after the weekend, my parents came back, they\u2019d found a flat and within, I think 24 hours, I was on the train to Dresden. Never looked back again. And --"

And, until \u201842, I went to that school, had very good school friends and even managed to do my -- take my matric in 1942. Pll come back to that in a moment. I just want to mention that two years ago I was back in East Germany, with a Christian group, we were -- we were visiting some churches right on the Polish border.

It had been quite a thriving factory place, so -- in -- before \u201833, in the early days of Hitler. And went round the place to identify my school and one or two other places. Went back to the station, had a few minutes to spare. Went back, waited at the station for a moment. Walked down station roat and remembered that one of my school friends used to live there and he -- his father had a agricultural place, shop. And I was totally amazed that the place was still there, with the same name, Lishgut. So I walked in, the daughter-in-law was in the shop and said, \u201cYes, my father-in-law 1s here, I\u2019ll go call him.\u201d And he was out in the yard, I went out and said, \u201cHello, could I speak --\u201d. He didn\u2019t recognize me after 50 years. And I mentioned my name. And he looked at me, took my hand and before he said anything else, said, \u201cI\u2019m so very sorry for what we did to you.

Then, of course, the critical time came in \u201844, when things were pretty desperate, sort of, in the west and in the east. And at this point, mishlings were also being called up, but not into the armed forces, but into the Tut Organization. The Tut Organization was a -- run by one of Hitler\u2019s ministers, to be engaged in emergency work, for instance, the building of the Atlantic wall and the repair of bombed railway stations, lines and all that sort of thing, in east and west. So we were not soldiers, but we were sort of -- in fact, we were regarded as second class citizens. We didn\u2019t wear a uniform, we just wore an armband which said, Tut Organization. And we were made -- made up of people with my background, political prisoners and also minor criminals. A queer mixture of people. And when was it? April \u00b044, I said good-bye to my mother, I did not know what was going to happen to her in Dresden. Obviously we had no real contact with my father in England. I didn\u2019t know USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0455 9 where I was going to land up, they didn\u2019t tell us, we were just loaded onto a train in Dresden and eventually we realized that we were on our way to France. And we\u2019re then sort of detailed to work on railway sites that had been bombed, to repair them -- very often, with time bombs going out -- going off at place-places. And that went on til September -- from April \u201844 to September \u201844. Mainly in the Paris area. Again, we were subject to quite a few air raids, but survived.

The allies were sort of advancing, we were slowly being withdrawn and we knew that one day we would return to Germany and then of course, what was going to happen then?

And so, at that time there was sort of complete chaos in France. There were refugees from various countries which had been caught up by the Germans and also run away. And we were all taken down to the south of France to be repatriated to our various countries, but of course, they couldn\u2019t repatriate us. So we were eventually -- the Jews didn\u2019t want us, because we weren\u2019t proper Jews. So we -- there was an organization called Free Germany, which was really a -- a Communist organization, we landed up there. And we were indoctrinated to learn about Stalin and Marx and Lenin and all the rest of it. And that was not a very pleasant time and food was very short in France -- in the south of France at the time and there was no heating, terrible winter. But, eventually, I got a job with the American army. And also, about December, I mean post communications were [indecipherable] almost non-existent, but I wrote to the Bishop of Chichester -- Chichester, because that\u2019s all I knew, in very halting English, \u201cSir, ?\u2019m Juergen Simonson, I think you know my father. I would like to go to England and be reunited with him.\u201d And eventually he got the letter. I got a cable from him to say, \u201cLetter received. I will put you in touch with my -- your father and I\u2019m trying everything with the British Home Office, to get you a visa to England.\u201d That was still very difficult for a German."
