So Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24, 2010 30 ba \u0152 when you have a hat, is in a different place, the shoes. There was so many. Aga \u0152 how you call that in English? A mountain of shoes, a mountain of s \u0152 coat. And I wanted \u0152 oh yeah, already wanted to take, because the German said take off your coat and stay in line. And \u0152 and it was cold, and I kind of tried to take out the coat, and I couldn\u2122t take it off, so I put it on back, and I stand wi \u0152 til our line was come, we are going to be dead in a minute. So the line was going slowly, slowly, slowly, and so we stay, my father, mother, we stay all together, and my uncle, and the two little babies. And suddenly, you know, this is the worst moment in my life. I know why I was always \u0152 use that. That particular moment, I will never forget that. I don\u2122t know from where, I don\u2122t know why, suddenly arri \u0152 arrived four Germans on horses. White, beautiful horses. And on every horse was a general , a German general. Not a Hakenkreuz , because some of them was Hakenkreuz , they were the worst. No Hakenkreuz , just German uniform. Til today I don\u2122t know who they were. That was a miracle. And he said out \u0152 not ch asen, out, out, out, not chasen(ph), not chasen (ph). And \u0152 and the [indecipherable] stopped. And that general of the four horses say, women, if you are schneiderin in(ph) come to me, come to me, come to me. I need \u0152 I have a factory, and you can work as schneiderin in my factory. My mom grabbed me and my sister and screamed, I am a schneiderin , mine children\u2122s in schneiderin [indecipherable] my life. We were Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24, 2010 31 schneiderin , and \u0152 and there\u2122s was my father, my sister and my brother stayed on the grave, they was killed, in that particular time, in Rumbula , that was happened in Rumbula . That is the \u0152 the name, Rumbula , where the killing was. And that, I am the only witness alive, of today. The only. I will show you in the corridor, I have a little memorial there. So, how chasen \u0152 my mom \u0152 so we stay \u0152 we\u2122ll stay with the officer. You know, every little thing maybe will be different. At least my mom has both \u0152 both girls, you know. She was very happy. We are schneiderin and we shall stay. So, there was a running other woman, other woman, and it was a group with about 200, or 150, I really don\u2122t remember. The people know each other from a [indecipherable] shtetl, you know, you know each other. And so \u0152 so was, we stayed there behind the four fe \u0152 horses, beautiful horses, I will never forget these horses. And they \u0152 there \u0152 the uniform what the \u0152 the Germans has, was like Wehrmacht . This is a different German, the kind of. No Hakenkreuz . I really looked at that, it was no Hakenkreuz . They was Wehrmacht officers, but the y was officers, definitely big \u0152 big shots. So, when the group was about 150 already, we moved. The other, they moved. He \u0152 we \u0152 he took it out of that. They basically save us, kind of, in a way. So, he say, you follow me. This group goes on \u0152 this is the other group. You come after me, we will go ahead. So the four horses went the front, and we went under. We was tired, and hungry, but we went, because we Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24, 2010 32 thought maybe this a good thing, maybe we\u2122ll work as schneiderin , and that\u2122s very good. So we walk and walk through the woods. It was all the same. They \u0152 they went this way, we went this way. So we walk and walk and walk, and where we walk, I am from Riga , I know every corner. It is the prison. It is Termin (ph) prison, the name was Termin (ph), Termin (ph) prison, the name of the prison. The \u0152 the \u0152 that the \u0152 how you call that? The prison [indecipherable] get up \u0152 you know, it is from wood, such \u0152 with eyes that went up, and th-the \u0152 the horses and the people were standing here, with all these 150 or 20, I don\u2122t remember how many, went in and \u0152 and this a [indecipherable] prison. I was never in prison, I didn\u2122t know, but you know, you know how a prison looks, yes. But the four \u0152 the \u0152 the \u0152 this \u0152 the Germans on the four horses stayed outside. We never saw him. We never worked as schneiderinin (ph). Til today, I kn-know that they saved our lives, because they took us away from the [indecipherable] . Otherwise we \u0152 we stayed in the line, because it were only lucky we \u0152 we stayed in the back. Otherwise, we would be killed, like other people. So, now we\u2122re in the pri-prison. What are we going to do, 150 people about, or 20, I don\u2122t know. So, usually in a prison when you are, you get your own kamera with a little whatever. No, the Jews didn\u2122t get that. They took us on \u0152 on top on the prison, with a open sky, and it was November, I remember that was November. It was cold. It was very cold, and it \u0152 the waywer \u0152 the weather was Interview with Carolina Taitz January 24, 2010 33 wonderful, not snowing, and not raining. At that time in Latvia is always terrible snow, and terrible rain. Nothing. So, we sit all together [indecipherable] to each other because it was cold.
