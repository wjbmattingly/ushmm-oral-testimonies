So the line was going slowly, slowly, slowly, and so we stay, my father, mother, we stay all together, and my uncle, and the two little babies. And suddenly, you know, this is the worst moment in my life. I know why I was always \u2014 use that. That particular moment, I will never forget that. I don\u2019t know from where, I don\u2019t know why, suddenly arri \u2014 arrived four Germans on horses. White, beautiful horses. And on every horse was a general, a German general. Not a Hakenkreuz, because some of them was Hakenkreuz, they were the worst. No Hakenkreuz, just German uniform. Til today I don\u2019t know who they were. That was a miracle. And he said out \u2014 not chasen, out, out, out, not chasen(ph), not chasen(ph). And \u2014 and the [indecipherable] stopped. And that general of the four horses say, women, if you are schneiderinin(ph) come to me, come to me, come to me. I need \u2014 I have a factory, and you can work as schneiderin in my factory. My mom grabbed me and my sister and screamed, I am a schneiderin, mine children\u2019s in schneiderin [indecipherable] my life. We were Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Carolina Taitz \u00bb January 24, 2010 schneiderin, and \u2014 and there\u2019s was my father, my sister and my brother stayed on the grave, they was killed, in that particular time, in Rumbula, that was happened in Rumbula. That is the \u2014 the name, Rumbula, where the killing was. And that, I am the only witness alive, of today. The only. I will show you in the corridor, I have a little memorial there. So, how chasen \u2014 my mom \u2014 so we stay \u2014 we\u2019ll stay with the officer. You know, every little thing maybe will be different. At least my mom has both \u2014 both girls, you know. She was very happy. We are schneiderin and we shall stay. So, there was a running other woman, other woman, and it was a group with about 200, or 150, I really don\u2019t remember. The people know each other from a [indecipherable] shtetl, you know, you know each other. And so \u2014 so was, we stayed there behind the four fe \u2014 horses, beautiful horses, I will never forget these horses. And they \u2014 there \u2014 the uniform what the \u2014 the Germans has, was like Wehrmacht. This is a different German, the kind of. No Hakenkreuz. I really looked at that, it was no Hakenkreuz. They was Wehrmacht officers, but they was officers, definitely big \u2014 big shots. So, when the group was about 150 already, we moved. The other, they moved. He \u2014 we \u2014 he took it out of that. They basically save us, kind of, in a way. So, he say, you follow me. This group goes on \u2014 this is the other group. You come after me, we will go ahead. So the four horses went the front, and we went under. We was tired, and hungry, but we went, because we Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Carolina Taitz * January 24, 2010 thought maybe this a good thing, maybe we\u2019 ll work as schneiderin, and that\u2019s very good. So we walk and walk through the woods. It was all the same. They \u2014 they went this way, we went this way. So we walk and walk and walk, and where we walk, I am from Riga, I know every corner. It is the prison. It is Termin(ph) prison, the name was Termin(ph), Termin(ph) prison, the name of the prison. The \u2014 the \u2014 that the \u2014 how you call that?

Otherwise we \u2014 we stayed in the line, because it were only lucky we \u2014 we stayed in the back. Otherwise, we would be killed, like other people. So, now we\u2019re in the pri-prison. What are we going to do, 150 people about, or 20, I don\u2019t know. So, usually in a prison when you are, you get your own kamera with a little whatever. No, the Jews didn\u2019t get that.
