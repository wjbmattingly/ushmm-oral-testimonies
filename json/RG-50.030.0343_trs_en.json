And we went through the first, when the Gestapo came in after a week or two weeks, they called in, the Jewish had already\u2014the Jewish had an existing Jewish community council, because according to the law, the Polish law, this was an expression of democracy. Jewish had the right to elect their own representatives and a council which would deal with education, and welfare and so on and the right to tax the Jewish population. So when they came in, when the Germans came in, the had already an organized group. They came to talk and demand.

At night, police, German police, was going from house to house. Before this, each house or each home which was Jewish, you had to put on your window a Star of David. So the non-Jew knew the Jews. If you were a Jew, you know where to go. So at night, they were going from house to house and telling them, you are going to labor camp, get your belongings and come out to the marketplace. There was a marketplace, typical Eastern European. So we went out. There was already a few thousands Jews. There was trucks already. The old people were loaded in the trucks and they left.

I didn\u2019t take money because sometimes the Germans would stop the train and look because all the black market was going to trains. So I didn\u2019t want to take it because I need money . And I gave him I take out, I said, there\u2019s my money. So he takes two 50\u2019s and gives me 50 back and said, go. So I survived. The second time, when I was in the Warsaw ghetto and I came out, I came out and gave the policeman and I walked and I feel somebody\u2019s after me because you have the feeling like somebody is always after you. Some people aren\u2019t paying attention, but I think he looks at me. Somebody is after me. And you look and see a man until he comes and says, you\u2019re Jewish. So I sat and talked to him, blah, blah, blah, and went into a bar, drink a bottle of Vodka. (Inaudible). I had a kilo. A kilo is two and a half bottles. It was in the chimney. So I had the money. And he asked me what I\u2019m doing here. I told him that and to buy saccharine because the Jews were so smart they were making saccharine in the ghetto with the factory. (Inaudible). No sugar, saccharine. I give him this story, and he said, here\u2019s my address. Go back to in case you need something and you come and get in touch with me. (Inaudible). So I\u2019m going and I\u2019m going to Krakow. It\u2019s 7 o\u2019clock at night. You almost don\u2019t see any people.

I\u2019m undressing and putting on pajamas and getting ready for bed. And somebody . Open. He said open. and right away _ I knew this was not Gestapo. This was military police. So I knew already.

As soon as he hits me, I said, yes, I cannot take it. I do not and I cannot hit back. I have to give up. I\u2019m ready for this. I was ready. Yes. I got arrested. He brings me to still not Gestapo, still military police who are stationed, the police station, the military police station. They put me in a cell, and I put up my collar, and I fell asleep. Then somebody wakes me at 8:00 in the morning. The sergeant calls me in and starts to ask\u2014he had my wallet. I had some pictures. They didn\u2019t take it. And I started to talk to him. I said, I know . This time was already _ I said, I need you found outside of his place, this ghetto or places where he has to be, arrest and execution. So I know . But I start . And I tell him to send me to the Gestapo. I know what Gestapo does. (Inaudible). Take me out and . He said, what are you talking about? (Inaudible). He said, you will work and help us to win the war. Anyway, he gives me\u2014 after ten minutes, here comes an older soldier, and we start working, and I know that I work for the Gestapo. This I know. I go and I start talking to him in German and tell him take me to the Gestapo. You know what the Gestapo is, what Gestapo is going to do with me and give him all the smear (ph). The street cars would come to a stop, and here come the street cars to a stop. (Inaudible). And he said to me, go. He let me go. I\u2019m jumping inside. He\u2019s jumping after me. (Inaudible). I talk to him. He wasn\u2019t sure. Here are a lot of people. I could not talk to him and tell him to help me. And he brought me to the Gestapo.

In the military, you go, it takes you\u2014and they are talking about crematory. I tell you about crematory. (Inaudible). The crematory, more or less, is very simple. It\u2019s a big place with ovens. You go, there is an opening from the oven. It can be 2, 3, 4,5. And the wagons to take out the dead people and put them in the oven and push. By the way, you start the fire with fat people because they burn better. The technique so far, the German technique and science is you need a fat man, a fat Jew. So push him in the crematory and he will burn. This is everything. When you come out and you have time to think, you think about what I mention. It\u2019s something unbelievable. Our children, children takes longer to die from the gas. When the commander guys, this is a big haul, there are all kinds of signs, a shower room. When you come in, you think because you have to undress yourself. The commanders have to help you, men and women. Then you\u2019re being shaved, totally shaved, a woman totally shaved.

After an hour, most of the people are on the floor. Children not yet. Children took longer to die. (End of Tape 3) Tape 4 So children are still standing up. So again, the commander has to come. And I don\u2019t know. So the children have the gas already inside. Do you understand? But they are still not down. They would need another ten minutes\u2019 gas. So this problem was solved. I never asked. By the way, I am by because I was inside. I was in the crematory. Sometimes in 1944, supposedly came a transport from Vienna, Gentiles, mixed Jews and non-Jews. Everybody went . The commandant . Then they realized a day later or something that in the group were Gentiles, not Jews. This is not allowed. So what to do? There\u2019s only one thing to do, that\u2019s tattoo them. Give them a number. That means that they are in that camp, that everything is all right and then something happens to them and because they die, they go to the oven. So we went. So yes.

I forget that . So if he would see me one day not shaved, he would take me to the end of the group and shoot me and leave me on the road. So there were four of us. We have to go four, like military. I was always between the four. I was shaved. We had this shaving cream from maybe a hundred years old, but you rubbed your face.

Don\u2019t say it\u2019s yours. Don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s possible they would take away the child, but you would survive. If you will keep the child, you will not survive. You will go and the child will go. So it\u2019s a question. I said according to my feelings, you have to give away the child only to survive because the Germans want to kill you too. So they did.

It was everything normal until one day\u2014it was about the 7\" of May, 7\u201d of May, yeah\u2014came KGB and took us all, took us to a place where it was about a few thousand Russian former prisoners of war, that big villa with a big backyard. People on the floor. I knew right away that we were with KGB. I saw the people were shot down. These were Russians with the big suitcases. They robbed from the Germans and so on.

May 9, May 9, yes, we were still in the mines, and they came, Czechoslovakians, so happy you\u2019re here. Go. So I, again, with the Russian language, come to him, and it\u2019s a major, military major, tanks, big tanks. This was on the way to Prague. It was an agreement between General and General Eisenhower. You take Prague; we will take Berlin. So I come in, and I\u2019m going to this major, and I said, .
