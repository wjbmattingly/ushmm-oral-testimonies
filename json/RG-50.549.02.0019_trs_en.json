She never talked to me, but she talked to the people who I\u2019m do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me know why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing. And so in that sense, I didn\u2019t know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this. It was very interesting. So, as I was saying, it was a spider web and -- and it was extended to me, I was part of it and they took care of me. So, even though I didn\u2019t know it. But anyway -- so, after the war, I was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our old address and -- and saying, \u201cWell, what happened to your family? What happened?\u201d You know, and these were people all over the world. I mean Australia and South America and America -- you know, was North America. Canada, every -- letters came from all over the world. And I went back to our old apartment, which was the place they all wrote to. And I told the lady where I was and she -- she forwarded all the mail. When I saw them all -- all these letters, I ch -- answered only the ones that I could remember, because many of these peop -- they were all friends of my parents, not of mine. And some of them I didn\u2019t remember and some of them I did. And the one I remembered best, was Dr. Kalinoffsky\u2019s family, because in Berlin we used to have gymnastics with their two daughters, they had two daughters, Hilda and Lothar Kalinoffsky. And we had gymnastics with them in Berlin and when we came to Holland, they had gone -- he was a psychiatrist in Berlin and they had gone to Rome. And he had to study again, he got a degree in Rome. And he was a psychiatrist in Rome. And then, when a -- when he felt like things weren\u2019t going so well in Italy, he decided to go to the United States.

And that\u2019s where he was, in New York. So when I got their letter, I wrote. And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of Psychiatry at the free University of Berlin. I think it\u2019s in Dallem. It\u2019s in Dallem or wherever it is. It\u2019s in -- near Berlin -- in Berlin. And so h-he decided he was going to go via Amsterdam and -- to Berlin, from -- from the in -- from New York. So he came by and he said, \u201cCome to the United States. Come -- we take care of it, come.\u2019 You know? Well, I was doing very well at that time and I kept saying, \u201cNo, I -- I can\u2019t make up my mind.\u201d He kept saying, \u201cLook, your parents aren\u2019t going to come back and --\u201d as I\u2019m telling on the other tape, I kept thinking, \u201cYes, maybe they will come back, and my sister. Somebody will show up, you know, they will be all r -- somebody will come, I can\u2019t come right away.\u201d So I postponed and postponed. Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three, four months, when he had to go to Berlin, and say, \u201cCome, come, come.\u201d And he sent me an affidavit. And I got a call from the American embassy in Rotterdam and they were saying, \u201cWell, do you want to come, or don\u2019t you want to come? You got plenty of people who want to come, I mean, what\u2019s going on there?\u201d And so I took a deep breath and I went. It was terribly hard. I mean, I had a boyfriend and I had -- you know, I was -- I was in the ballet, I was doing well and I was getting up there and it was just terribly hard to leave. But on the other hand, I really -- I didn\u2019t see a real future and I -- I thought, well, you know, my parents were killed, my sister was gone, my grandmother was gone, my -- I had family. I had a lot of family still, my mother\u2019s family there. And even a cousin of my father\u2019s, Heinz This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Well, it turned out that they lived on Long Island. And I -- I\u2019m having trouble remembering the town. I know that the second house that they had was -- oh yeah, I know, it was Babylon, I think. I think it was Babylon, but I\u2019m not sure. The second place they lived was Brightwaters. They moved pretty soon after I had came, they had -- they moved to Brightwaters and that\u2019s -- you know, it is a ways from New York. It -- you have to take the Long Island railroad. And as I found out pretty soon, you know, it was difficult. I had to be in New York for the dance -- for my classes at the American School of Ballet and it was hard to get to and fro -- get the timing right. I could never date, because I -- the train came -- you know, the train -- I had to take a certain train back. And it was just too complicated t-to -- to live out on the island if you wanted to be in New York, which I did.

And she was born and raised in Greenwich Village and her mother had a spare apartment. And so she and I moved in together to -- in Greenwich Village.

And we lived there together and where we lived was on Third Street, where now is the library of New York University, the law library of the uni -- and at the time, they were already trying to empty the buildings, you know, so there were quite a lot of empty apartments, people whose lease had run out and they weren\u2019t replacing these people, because they wanted to empty the buildings, but they had to go to the end of people\u2019s contract. And -- and her mother\u2019s contract was very long. So we were just -- there were a few people left in the building, so it was -- got quite creepy, because there were many, you know, people kem -- kept sleeping up on the stairs, you know, bums and -- and hobos and whatever you have there. And it was quite an exciting time in Greenwich Village. It was still a little bit of the old Greenwich Village, you know, that you -- that you hear about. Many Italians -- downstairs was a li -- a small Italian restaurant, that was where our telephone was. He -- he would keep message and get messages for us and we could, you know, go and get the messages and we could make calls there. And many, many a time. So -- but it was very nice. I mean, it was exciting, scary and nice. I had to learn how to ride those subways. I mean, I came out of Amsterdam, after the war and it was -- I mean, when I got here with the clothes that I thought were very fancy -- I had taken my mother\u2019s -- I had some of my mother\u2019s clothes in Holland and I had them remade for the United States.

And he took me out and I- he said, \u201cMa -- Your eyes -- what -- something wrong with your eyes?\u201d They were so red- rot -- red and swollen and he took me out and the funny thing, he took me to his club. And w-we went to his club and they fed me something. I -- I will -- I think 1t was -- I had scrambled eggs with ham or some sort of thing and there was something wrong with the ham and I ended up sick in London from -- from eating that -- that ham and this cousin, he - he had been just wonderful to me. He had saved his clothing coupons, there -- in England, and also in Holland, we still, in \u201847, had clothing coupons.

I mean, that\u2019s the only thing you can do. And I think that is a Jewish thing. Although, I must say, I\u2019ve met many, many Gentiles who have exactly that same feelings. And -- and in my basically being Jewish, you know, I think, who knows about their forebears? Who knows who they were? There must be some Jewish in them.
