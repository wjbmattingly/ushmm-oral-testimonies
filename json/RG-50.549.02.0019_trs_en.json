I have always thought that my life -- it might have been different, because I would have never left Germany, you know. I was born in Berlin and I would have lived in Berlin and probably ma rried in Germany or whatever. And I would USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 4 have never had this broad experience of life, which I ended up having. Because Germany was very narrow. They were very focused upon themselves, they were the greatest, the best, the this and the that. And you would have never had this wide experience. But I would have had a very interesting life, wa -- you know, one way or the other. I don\u2122t know if it would have -- from that point, if you had -- it made a diffe rence, in the sense that I was kicked out -- you know, that I had to leave, that I had to live a broader life than I would have otherwise. But as far as the history of humanity goes, that you have children -- that you marry and you have chi -- you grow up, marry and have children, I don\u2122t think that would have been very different. Would have been in a different country, but it wouldn\u2122t have been very different. I do think that my outlook ended up much broader than it would have been if I\u2122d never left Germany, yeah."

They were all connected, one way or the other, even though their beliefs might have been and their reasons for doing the work might have been very different from each other. During the war, they all worked together. And anyway, I sa -- we survived the war and after the war, I was in the ballet with Sonia Gasco. It is a -- the ballet that -- that later became Niederlancer Balletta, the big Dutch ballet in -- in the Stutz-Hober, the big theater in -- in amst -- the state ballet. It was then called the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 6 Ballet 1945, when -- when I was in it. That was the beginning. And Madame Gasco, who -- who started it, started organizing this last month before the war was ended. We -- we already knew, you know, that the war was going to end and we started practicing and -- and -- and rehearsing and doing all these things. And we were ready -- not quite -- by the time the war was -- was actually ended. And I -- I worked with her and I danced with the ballet and I had various other jobs. I also did photography. I studied photography with a friend of my mother\u2122s, who had also survived the war and had actually sort of held her hand over my head, even though I didn\u2122t even know it. But she had sort of protected me from various things that went on during the war. So it\u2122s all very complicated, but -- but it -- that\u2122s how it was."

She never talked to me, but she talked to the people who I\u2122m do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me know why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing. And so in that sense, I didn\u2122t know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this. It was very interesting. So, as I was saying, it was a spider web and -- and it was extended to me, I was part of it and they took care of me. So, even though I di dn\u2122t know it. But anyway -- so, after the war, I was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our old address and -- and saying, \ufb01Well, what happened to your family? What happened?\ufb02 You know, and these were people all over the world. I mean Australia and South America and America -- you know, was North America. Canada, every -- letters came from all over the world. And I went back to our old apartment, which was the place they all wrote to. And I told the lady where I was and she -- she forwarded all the mail. When I saw them all -- all these letters, I ch -- answered only the ones that I could remember, because many of these peop -- they were all friends of my parents, not of mine. And some of them I didn\u2122t remember and some of them I did. And the one I remembered best, was Dr. Kalinoffsky\u2122s family, because in Berlin we used to have gymnastics with their two daughters, they had two daughters, Hilda and Lothar Kalinoffsky. And we had gymnastics with them in Berlin and when we came to Holland, they had gone -- he was a psychiatrist in Berlin and they had gone to Rome. And he had to study again, he got a degree in Rome. And he was a psychiatrist in Rome. And then, when a -- when he felt like things weren\u2122t going so well in Italy, he decided to go to the United States. He went to the United States with his family and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 8 he had to do a third degree -- the third -- you know, he got -- he got his doctorate in psychiatry in New York. And that\u2122s where he was, in New York. So when I got their letter, I wrote. And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of Psychiatry at the free University of Berlin. I think it\u2122s in Dallem. It\u2122s in Dallem or wherever it is. It\u2122s in -- near Berlin -- in Berlin. And so h-he decided he was going to go via Amsterdam and -- to Berlin, from -- from the in -- from New York. So he came by and he said, \ufb01Come to the United States. Come -- we take care of it, come.\ufb02 You know? Well, I was doing very well at that time and I kept saying, \ufb01No, I -- I can\u2122t make up my mind.\ufb02 He kept saying, \ufb01Look, your parents aren\u2122t going to come back and --\ufb02 as I\u2122m telling on the other tape, I kept thinking, \ufb01Yes, maybe they will come back, and my sister. Somebody will show up, you know, they will be all r -- somebody will come, I can\u2122t come right away.\ufb02 So I postponed and postponed. Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three, four months, when he had to go to Berlin, and say, \ufb01Come, come, come.\ufb02 And he sent me an affidavit. And I got a call from the American embassy in Rotterdam and they were saying, \ufb01Well, do you want to come, or don\u2122t you want to come? You got plenty of people who want to come, I mean, what\u2122s going on there?\ufb02 And so I took a deep breath and I went. It was terribly hard. I mean, I had a boyfriend and I had -- you know, I was -- I was in the ballet, I was doing well and I was getting up there and it was just terribly hard to leave. But on the other hand, I really -- I didn\u2122t see a real future and I -- I thought, well, you know, my parents were killed, my sister was gone, my grandmother was gone, my -- I had family. I had a lot of family still, my mother\u2122s family there. And even a cousin of my father\u2122s, Heinz USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 9 Kemfer was still there and -- in Holland. And -- but it wasn\u2122t really my own, you know? It wasn\u2122t close enough and -- so many changes had taken place, and I should make a change. And it doesn\u2122t have to be forever, I kept taying -- saying to myself. You know, I mean, after all, I could come back and you know, if I -- if I really didn\u2122t like it, you know, I could come back and --"

            "answer": "Well, that -- tha -- I didn\u2122t even think about that because he\u2122s -- well, I thought I was going to dance, actually. Yes, I thought I was going to dance. Well, it turned out that they lived on Long Island. And I -- I\u2122m having trouble remembering the town. I know that the second house that they had was -- oh yeah, I know, it was Babylon, I think. I think it was Babylon, but I\u2122m not sure. The second place they lived was Brightwaters. They moved pretty soon after I had came, they had -- they moved to Brightwaters and that\u2122s -- you know, it is a ways from New York. It -- you have to take the Long Island railroad. And as I found out pretty soon, you know, it was difficult. I had to be in New York for the dance -- for my classes at the American School of Ballet and it was hard to get to and fro -- get the timing right. I could never date, because I -- the train came -- you know, the train -- I had to take a certain train back. And it was just too complic ated t-to -- to live out on the island if you wanted to be in New York, which I did. And so I met a girl, Ellen Crooks, I met her in -- at the balle -- in the ballet class, at the Amer ican School of Ballet. And she was born and raised in Greenwich Village and her mother had a spare apartment. And so she and I moved in together to -- in Greenwich Village. And it was wonderful to have her, because I mean, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 10 she was -- she knew every little corner of -- of Greenwich Village, having been raised there. And she was very nice girl -- very good girl and -- and we -- we had -- we lived together. We finally took another -- a girl -- a woman -- a girl, I guess we were then. And we lived there together and where we lived was on Third Street, where now is the library of New York University, the law library of the uni -- and at the time, they were already trying to empty the buildings, you know, so there were qu ite a lot of empty apartments, people whose lease had run out and they weren\u2122t replacing these people, because they wanted to empty the buildings, but they had to go to the end of people\u2122s contract. And -- and her mother\u2122s contract was very long. So we were just -- there were a few people left in the building, so it was -- got quite creepy, because there were many, you know, people kem -- kept sleeping up on the stairs, you know, bums and -- and hobos and whatever you have there. And it was quite an exciting time in Greenwich Village. It was still a little bit of the old Greenwich Village, you know, that you -- that you hear about. Many Italians -- downstairs was a li -- a small Italian restaurant, that was where our telephone was. He -- he would keep message and get messages for us and we could, you know, go and get the messages and we could make calls there. And many, many a time. So -- but it was very nice. I mean, it was exciting, scary and nice. I had to learn how to ride those subways. I mean, I came out of Amsterdam, after the war and it was -- I mean, when I got he re with the clothes that I thought were very fancy -- I had taken my mother\u2122s -- I had some of my mother\u2122s clothes in Holland and I had them remade for the United States. Well I got to the United States and I looked like a spook, compared to the other people in the United States. It was -- there was something going on USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 11 called the new look. Remember, they wore th ese -- these very -- these skirts with many ruffles, sort of wide with -- with underskirts underneath, sticking out a little bit on the -- on the borders and I mean I looked absolutely -- what I thought was high elegance, I looked weird, highly weird. So the first day that we were there, Mrs. Kalinoffsky took me into New York, went to Macy\u2122s and she got me outfitted. I got a new coat -- I\u2122ll never forget the coat. These kind of things, you remember."

He wrote all the news from the United Nations and he -- he had been an editor of the Haffsupost in the -- in -- in the Hague and he had worked -- always been a journalist, so -- anyway, he -- in 1939, he took his family to the United States.

So there is my grandfather Hendrick in this teeny tiny town in the west -- in the west -- pardon me, in the east of Holland. He hated it with such a passion. Now, those people were very religious. My grandfather was religious, he was raised very Jewish, but he wasn\u2122t like they were, they USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 29 were narrow about it. And so he fled, after awhile and he started going east. And he kept going east and he told these stories about first he got to Dusseldorf, one of those towns. And he had to have some money. So he took a job with a furrier, and what did he have to do? The furriers would get furs from all over Europe, mostly Russia and -- and -- and the Scandinavian countries. And he had to scrape the flesh off of the furs, so you can imagine the stink in there. I mean, it was horrendous. And since he was the littlest, because he was only like -- I don\u2122t know exactly his age, but he was very young. And he would be -- the bag, because it stank so much, was hung out of the window -- where the scrapes were scraped into. And because he was the littlest, he was put into the bag to stamp it down. To -- to -- to compress that stuff, because he -- because -- then they could put more in the bag, these bags were leather and they were then taken somewhere and -- and emptied, I imagine. And he was telling these ta -- he --we -- used tell these awful stories, how terrible that all was and he didn\u2122t want to do that, so he fled again and he kept walking east -- east -- east -- east. There was another uncle in -- in Berlin. And he got to Berlin and that uncle ha -- wa -- had a furrier business and he took furs that were already scraped and ready to go, you know, to be made into coats. And that\u2122s where my grandfather Hendrick learned his business. It was very -- it\u2122s a very amusing story, becaus e what happened then -- he was quite handsome -- he was very blonde, very blue eyed -- sort of a reddish blonde hair. I was called a st -- called a Dutchman. And he was -- there were Jewish families in Berlin that had been there a long time, were very settled and one of them was the Filipis. And they were extremely rich and -- and one day the daughter, Ellen, my future grandmother had her 16th or 18th USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 30 birthday. And my great-grandfather, Louis -- Louis -- Luis, I think his name was -- who rode horses and did crazy things all -- all his life, gave a huge party for her. It was a g -- like a coming out party, sort of -- you would call it now. And he invited every eligible bachelor in Berlin to that party. And so my grandfather knew he wasn\u2122t eligible at all. I mean, he was just, you know, a poor boy, really, working in -- in somebody\u2122s business. But he heard -- a friend of his told him that there was going to be this great party, in this fabulous house and -- and he said, \ufb01Well, I want to go.\ufb02 And the friend said, \ufb01Well you have to have an invitation.\ufb02 And he says, \ufb01Well, we\u2122ll manage somehow.\ufb02 You know, \ufb01We\u2122ll -- we\u2122ll manage it. Just take me with you,\ufb02 you know. So they rented a suit for him and they went and somehow he got in and because he was r eally very handsome. He was tall and he was nice looking and -- and blonde, she f -- Ellen liked him, of all the boys there, you know, with beautiful names, that had been in Ber lin for age -- she chose Hendrick Zeetroon. And her father, after the party, said, \ufb01Well, which one shall it be?\ufb02 Because he knew that whoever he chose, with all his money, sh e was going to get. So she said, \ufb01Hendrick Zeetroon.\ufb02 And he\u2122d never heard of him -- a nybody like that. It was a disaster. He l -- he said, \ufb01Never,\ufb02 you know. And she said, \ufb01Oh, yes.\ufb02 And she locked herself in her room and she wouldn\u2122t eat and she wouldn\u2122t drink and she wouldn\u2122t this and she wouldn\u2122t that and she had the key and he couldn\u2122t get -- they couldn\u2122t get into the -- into the room. There were lots of sisters in her family and brothers also. But they couldn\u2122t -- he loved Ellen because she was just as strong as he was. This was my grandfather I\u2122m talking about, Louie.

He traveled all over the world and was a great collector of oriental art, mostly Japanese. And after he retired, he became extremely well known because he -- there\u2122s a small group of collectors all over the world, of these particular things that he was collecting. And he wrote many articles in the -- their papers and in their -- in their journals and magazines and that was the interesting thing about that side also, of the family, how very artistic -- how very internationally artistic they were. They all were like that -- I ver -- it was really amazing because Ray -- th-the son, who lives in Israel, he\u2122s also like that, he\u2122s also collecting and he\u2122s also, you know, very interested in history and in -- in -- in that whole oriental art. And I remember Heinz coming to visit in -- in Washington, when we still lived up there in -- in -- at Chevy Chase and he went to the Freer gallery the director knew him, you know? The head of the gallery knew him -- his name, anyw ay and he took him down into the stacks and he saw -- my hus -- Marty went with him -- my husband Martin went with him and so he told me how they saw things that was neve r -- you know, that was never, or hardly ever displayed, because the Freer never had enough gallery space to display. No museum really has everything that they have. So Heinz was qu -- he made quite a second life for himself after he retired. Okay, what happened to them in the war was that they had friends who USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 50 helped them go underground and who also took a ll their things and hid -- with them and kept it for them. And Heinz and Ava were underground with a farmer, who had a big farm somewhere in -- in Holland. And they could not keep Ray with them. Ray was only year and a half, or two -- something like that and they had to hide Ray. Now Ray was very Jewish looking, different from them, actually . Heinz looked a bit like you and Ava was -- you couldn\u2122t tell what she was. So, but -- but Ray had quite, you know, he had a definite kind of darkness, which in Holland you don\u2122t see much. And he was hard to hide and he was very little. And so, somehow the underground managed to hide him and just recently -- I thought -- I thought that he\u2122d only been in one place the whole time. But just recently Ray told me that he was in many places, that he was handed around, you know, in many places. And that he felt -- was -- really had a terrible time, til the very end, the last people ended up being absolutely wonderful. And he\u2122s still in touch with them and he still ta -- you know, he -- he -- when their children come over here, he takes care of them. I\u2122m -- I don\u2122t mean over here, when they ever come to Israel. The Dutch like to go to Israel, so they do come. And when he goes to Holland, he always visits that family. And it was most amazing how close they really had gotten."

My father -- Manfred offered -- he -- he offered the papers and my mother USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 65 said -- got -- got him the money. My mother ha d the papers.

And one of the big shocks, when I finally got into this Hopkins group, was the split between the Russian Polish group and the German group.

I was very angry at those Phi Ebs, which was the Jewish fraternity -- the German Jewish fraternity and the other ones, which Marty belonged to. His parents -- you know, I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 89 mean it was just awful, I despi -- and I got telephone calls.

Or because of him knowing what he -- his background, you know, his grandparents -- happened to his grandparents and this and that. Now, I want to tell you, we never discussed it. I mean, we talked about it, if it came up. You know, if there was something in the paper about the Holocaust or about the war, we discussed it. Dad -- Marty told about the Pacific war and what he -- what happened to him and I would te -- or he told a lot about -- about China, where he was -- eight months he was in China. And I -- and they would ask me and I did tell. I told a little bit, but never from a gruesome kind of point of view, you know? I di d not see a dead person, all during the war. As impossible as that seemed, I didn\u2122t. We weren\u2122t bombed to any degree in Amsterdam. And I never worked in the underground where you killed people or did anything like that. USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 122 And you know, there was nothing that I would tell that would scare them in any way. But I remember that when it was brought up in school -- and it was, you know, when he had history and -- or something at school, in high sc hool -- that they came back with these tales and that they asked me, you know, \ufb01Was it like this?\ufb02 And, \ufb01Was it like that?\ufb02 And -- and h -- they hated the Germans. I mean they just hated them. I didn\u2122t hate them at all. I mean, I -- I look at people as people and I don\u2122t expect too much from them. I don\u2122t expect from an -- an average person to put himself in danger fo r anybody else, not even for themselves. Most people just go along with what\u2122s going on where they live. It takes character to -- or -- it takes character or it takes absolute willpower to -- to be an ideologue of some sort. To -- to act differently than your surroundings. And there are very few people who would do that, you know? Very few people who stand up and -- up and say, \ufb01Do me something, but I feel this and that way.\ufb02 You know, bang. I mean, what\u2122s the good of it? So -- so you don\u2122t expect too much. You don\u2122t expect people to be other than normal in trying to stay alive. That seems to be the human condition. The -- the necessity to stay alive, really overcomes all other concerns that a person might have. And people will do nearly anything to -- of ne -- of -- of momentary necessity to achieve that goa l, the goal of staying alive. They sometimes will kill, because staying alive might say -- might need food and if there is very little food, you have to -- might have to do something to get it. I often think of that when we\u2122re stand in line at the grocery store. I think we can be -- we can afford to be friendly, because we know there\u2122s plenty more in the store, you know? But if there isn\u2122t -- so the human condition is very, very weak and shaky and it\u2122s built on certain assumptions, the assumptions of the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 123 moment. The assumption of -- that there is enough food and there\u2122s good water and there is good this and that and that is the wrong assumption. And you have to do something for it.

And in the end, just to die. You know? It is really a very ironical situation. I mean, I -- I think of th ese people on Long Island who recently died, who had this fantastic collection of paintings. I mean, they went all over the world, they collected, they collected, they collected. They spent billions, millions, you know, collecting, collecting. And when they died, people didn\u2122t even know what to do with the stuff. They just put in on auction, it went all over the world, it di -- so what, you know? I mean, it just is -- it is really ironic, it is so ironic. So what can you do? What can you do? I\u2122m -- I\u2122m trying to figure out what you can do. The only thing you can do that is worth something in life, is be good to your fellow man. The other travelers who happen to be on this earth, accidentally at the same time that you are. You know? And tr ying to help them, if you\u2122re better off than they are, in their trip across the years. I mean, it\u2122s just the only thing you can do. And also the only thing you can do is -- is take care of the people that you can reach. You know, it\u2122s as if your arms have a certain length and they stretch out as wide as they can and they hold whatever they can and they -- they do good to the ends of their fingertips. I mean, that\u2122s the only thing you can do. And I think that is a Jewish thing. Although, I must say, I\u2122ve met many, many Gentiles who have exactly that same feelings. And -- and in my basically being Jewish, you know, I think, who knows about their forebears? Who knows who they were? There must be some Jewish in them. Because you know, it is -- it is amazing, at the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 133 interfaith council. I mean they\u2122re nearly all Jewish -- I mean they\u2122re nearly all Gentiles and they have exactly the same outlook. So maybe it\u2122 s not Jewish after all. Maybe it\u2122s just being a good human being and -- and trying to [inde cipherable] the best you can while you are living. So I do."
