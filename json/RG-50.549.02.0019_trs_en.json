I was born in Berlin and I would have lived in Berlin and probably married in Germany or whatever. And I would Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection have never had this broad experience of life, which I ended up having. Because Germany was very narrow.

I don\u2019t know if it would have -- from that point, if you had -- it made a difference, in the sense that I was kicked out - you know, that I had to leave, that I had to live a broader life than I would have otherwise. But as far as the history of humanity goes, that you have children -- that you marry and you have chi -- you grow up, marry and have children, I don\u2019t think that would have been very different. Would have been in a different country, but it wouldn\u2019t have been very different. I do think that my outlook ended up much broader than it would have been if I\u2019d never left Germany, yeah."

They were all connected, one way or the other, even though their beliefs might have been and their reasons for doing the work might have been very different from each other. During the war, they all worked together. And anyway, I sa -- we survived the war and after the war, I was in the ballet with Sonia Gasco. It is a -- the ballet that -- that later became Niederlancer Balletta, the big Dutch ballet in -- in the Stutz-Hober, the big theater in -- in amst -- the state ballet.

And we were ready -- not quite -- by the time the war was -- was actually ended. And I -- I worked with her and I danced with the ballet and I had various other jobs. I also did photography. I studied photography with a friend of my mother\u2019s, who had also survived the war and had actually sort of held her hand over my head, even though I didn\u2019t even know it. But she had sort of protected me from various things that went on during the war. So it\u2019s all very complicated, but -- but it -- that\u2019s how it was."

She never talked to me, but she talked to the people who I\u2019m do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me know why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing. And so in that sense, I didn\u2019t know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this. It was very interesting. So, as I was saying, it was a spider web and -- and it was extended to me, I was part of it and they took care of me. So, even though I didn\u2019t know it. But anyway -- so, after the war, I was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our old address and -- and saying, \u201cWell, what happened to your family? What happened?\u201d You know, and these were people all over the world. I mean Australia and South America and America -- you know, was North America. Canada, every -- letters came from all over the world. And I went back to our old apartment, which was the place they all wrote to. And I told the lady where I was and she -- she forwarded all the mail. When I saw them all -- all these letters, I ch -- answered only the ones that I could remember, because many of these peop -- they were all friends of my parents, not of mine. And some of them I didn\u2019t remember and some of them I did. And the one I remembered best, was Dr. Kalinoffsky\u2019s family, because in Berlin we used to have gymnastics with their two daughters, they had two daughters, Hilda and Lothar Kalinoffsky. And we had gymnastics with them in Berlin and when we came to Holland, they had gone -- he was a psychiatrist in Berlin and they had gone to Rome. And he had to study again, he got a degree in Rome. And he was a psychiatrist in Rome. And then, when a -- when he felt like things weren\u2019t going so well in Italy, he decided to go to the United States. He went to the United States with his family and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection he had to do a third degree -- the third -- you know, he got -- he got his doctorate in psychiatry in New York. And that\u2019s where he was, in New York. So when I got their letter, I wrote. And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of Psychiatry at the free University of Berlin. I think it\u2019s in Dallem. It\u2019s in Dallem or wherever it is. It\u2019s in -- near Berlin -- in Berlin. And so h-he decided he was going to go via Amsterdam and -- to Berlin, from -- from the in -- from New York. So he came by and he said, \u201cCome to the United States. Come -- we take care of it, come.\u2019 You know? Well, I was doing very well at that time and I kept saying, \u201cNo, I -- I can\u2019t make up my mind.\u201d He kept saying, \u201cLook, your parents aren\u2019t going to come back and --\u201d as I\u2019m telling on the other tape, I kept thinking, \u201cYes, maybe they will come back, and my sister. Somebody will show up, you know, they will be all r -- somebody will come, I can\u2019t come right away.\u201d So I postponed and postponed. Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three, four months, when he had to go to Berlin, and say, \u201cCome, come, come.\u201d And he sent me an affidavit. And I got a call from the American embassy in Rotterdam and they were saying, \u201cWell, do you want to come, or don\u2019t you want to come? You got plenty of people who want to come, I mean, what\u2019s going on there?\u201d And so I took a deep breath and I went. It was terribly hard. I mean, I had a boyfriend and I had -- you know, I was -- I was in the ballet, I was doing well and I was getting up there and it was just terribly hard to leave. But on the other hand, I really -- I didn\u2019t see a real future and I -- I thought, well, you know, my parents were killed, my sister was gone, my grandmother was gone, my -- I had family. I had a lot of family still, my mother\u2019s family there. And even a cousin of my father\u2019s, Heinz Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Kemfer was still there and -- in Holland. And -- but it wasn\u2019t really my own, you know? It wasn\u2019t close enough and -- so many changes had taken place, and I should make a change. And it doesn\u2019t have to be forever, I kept taying -- saying to myself. You know, I mean, after all, I could come back and you know, if I -- if I really didn\u2019t like it, you know, I could come back and --"

Well, it turned out that they lived on Long Island. And I -- I\u2019m having trouble remembering the town. I know that the second house that they had was -- oh yeah, I know, it was Babylon, I think. I think it was Babylon, but I\u2019m not sure. The second place they lived was Brightwaters. They moved pretty soon after I had came, they had -- they moved to Brightwaters and that\u2019s -- you know, it is a ways from New York. It -- you have to take the Long Island railroad. And as I found out pretty soon, you know, it was difficult. I had to be in New York for the dance -- for my classes at the American School of Ballet and it was hard to get to and fro -- get the timing right. I could never date, because I -- the train came -- you know, the train -- I had to take a certain train back. And it was just too complicated t-to -- to live out on the island if you wanted to be in New York, which I did. And so I met a girl, Ellen Crooks, I met her in -- at the balle -- in the ballet class, at the American School of Ballet. And she was born and raised in Greenwich Village and her mother had a spare apartment. And so she and I moved in together to -- in Greenwich Village. And it was wonderful to have her, because I mean, she was -- she knew every little corner of -- of Greenwich Village, having been raised there. And she was very nice girl -- very good girl and -- and we -- we had -- we lived together. We finally took another -- a girl -- a woman -- a girl, I guess we were then. And we lived there together and where we lived was on Third Street, where now is the library of New York University, the law library of the uni -- and at the time, they were already trying to empty the buildings, you know, so there were quite a lot of empty apartments, people whose lease had run out and they weren\u2019t replacing these people, because they wanted to empty the buildings, but they had to go to the end of people\u2019s contract. And -- and her mother\u2019s contract was very long. So we were just -- there were a few people left in the building, so it was -- got quite creepy, because there were many, you know, people kem -- kept sleeping up on the stairs, you know, bums and -- and hobos and whatever you have there. And it was quite an exciting time in Greenwich Village. It was still a little bit of the old Greenwich Village, you know, that you -- that you hear about. Many Italians -- downstairs was a li -- a small Italian restaurant, that was where our telephone was. He -- he would keep message and get messages for us and we could, you know, go and get the messages and we could make calls there. And many, many a time. So -- but it was very nice. I mean, it was exciting, scary and nice. I had to learn how to ride those subways. I mean, I came out of Amsterdam, after the war and it was -- I mean, when I got here with the clothes that I thought were very fancy -- I had taken my mother\u2019s -- I had some of my mother\u2019s clothes in Holland and I had them remade for the United States. Well I got to the United States and I looked like a spook, compared to the other people in the United States. It was -- there was something going on Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about this collection called the new look. Remember, they wore these -- these very -- these skirts with many ruffles, sort of wide with -- with underskirts underneath, sticking out a little bit on the -- on the borders and I mean I looked absolutely -- what I thought was high elegance, I looked weird, highly weird. So the first day that we were there, Mrs. Kalinoffsky took me into New York, went to Macy\u2019s and she got me outfitted. I got a new coat -- Pll never forget the coat. These kind of things, you remember."

So there is my grandfather Hendrick in this teeny tiny town in the west -- in the west -- pardon me, in the east of Holland. He hated it with such a passion. Now, those people were very religious. My grandfather was religious, he was raised very Jewish, but he wasn\u2019t like they were, they were narrow about it. And so he fled, after awhile and he started going east. And he kept going east and he told these stories about first he got to Dusseldorf, one of those towns. And he had to have some money. So he took a job with a furrier, and what did he have to do? The furriers would get furs from all over Europe, mostly Russia and -- and -- and the Scandinavian countries. And he had to scrape the flesh off of the furs, so you can imagine the stink in there. I mean, it was horrendous. And since he was the littlest, because he was only like -- I don\u2019t know exactly his age, but he was very young. And he would be -- the bag, because it stank so much, was hung out of the window -- where the scrapes were scraped into. And because he was the littlest, he was put into the bag to stamp it down. To -- to -- to compress that stuff, because he -- because -- then they could put more in the bag, these bags were leather and they were then taken somewhere and -- and emptied, I imagine. And he was telling these ta -- he --we -- used tell these awful stories, how terrible that all was and he didn\u2019t want to do that, so he fled again and he kept walking east -- east -- east -- east. There was another uncle in -- in Berlin. And he got to Berlin and that uncle ha -- wa -- had a furrier business and he took furs that were already scraped and ready to go, you know, to be made into coats. And that\u2019s where my grandfather Hendrick learned his business. It was very -- it\u2019s a very amusing story, because what happened then -- he was quite handsome- he was very blonde, very blue eyed -- sort of a reddish blonde hair. I was called a st -- called a Dutchman. And he was -- there were Jewish families in Berlin that had been there a long time, were very settled and one of them was the Filipis. And they were extremely rich and -- and one day the daughter, Ellen, my future grandmother had her 16th or 18th Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection birthday. And my great-grandfather, Louis -- Louis -- Luis, I think his name was -- who rode horses and did crazy things all -- all his life, gave a huge party for her. It was a g -- like a coming out party, sort of -- you would call it now. And he invited every eligible bachelor in Berlin to that party. And so my grandfather knew he wasn\u2019t eligible at all. I mean, he was just, you know, a poor boy, really, working in -- in somebody\u2019s business. But he heard -- a friend of his told him that there was going to be this great party, in this fabulous house and - and he said, \u201cWell, I want to go.\u201d And the friend said, \u201cWell you have to have an invitation.\u201d And he says, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll manage somehow.\u201d You know, \u201cWe\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll manage it.

He was tall and he was nice looking and -- and blonde, she f -- Ellen liked him, of all the boys there, you know, with beautiful names, that had been in Berlin for age -- she chose Hendrick Zeetroon. And her father, after the party, said, \u201cWell, which one shall it be?\u201d Because he knew that whoever he chose, with all his money, she was going to get. So she said, \u201cHendrick Zeetroon.\u201d And he\u2019d never heard of him -- anybody like that. It was a disaster. He | -- he said, \u201cNever,\u201d you know.

He traveled all over the world and was a great collector of oriental art, mostly Japanese. And after he retired, he became extremely well known because he -- there\u2019s a small group of collectors all over the world, of these particular things that he was collecting. And he wrote many articles in the -- their papers and in their -- in their journals and magazines and that was the interesting thing about that side also, of the family, how very artistic -- how very internationally artistic they were. They all were like that -- I ver -- 1t was really amazing because Ray -- th-the son, who lives 1n Israel, he\u2019s also like that, he\u2019s also collecting and he\u2019s also, you know, very interested in history and in -- in -- in that whole oriental art. And I remember Heinz coming to visit in -- in Washington, when we still lived up there in -- in -- at Chevy Chase and he went to the Freer gallery the director knew him, you know? The head of the gallery knew him -- his name, anyway and he took him down into the stacks and he saw -- my hus -- Marty went with him -- my husband Martin went with him and so he told me how they saw things that was never -- you know, that was never, or hardly ever displayed, because the Freer never had enough gallery space to display. No museum really has everything that they have. So Heinz was qu -- he made quite a second life for himself after he retired. Okay, what happened to them in the war was that they had friends who Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection helped them go underground and who also took all their things and hid -- with them and kept it for them. And Heinz and Ava were underground with a farmer, who had a big farm somewhere in -- in Holland. And they could not keep Ray with them. Ray was only year and a half, or two -- something like that and they had to hide Ray. Now Ray was very Jewish looking, different from them, actually. Heinz looked a bit like you and Ava was -- you couldn\u2019t tell what she was. So, but -- but Ray had quite, you know, he had a definite kind of darkness, which in Holland you don\u2019t see much. And he was hard to hide and he was very little. And so, somehow the underground managed to hide him and just recently -- I thought -- I thought that he\u2019d only been in one place the whole time. But just recently Ray told me that he was in many places, that he was handed around, you know, in many places. And that he felt -- was -- really had a terrible time, til the very end, the last people ended up being absolutely wonderful. And he\u2019s still in touch with them and he still ta -- you know, he- he -- when their children come over here, he takes care of them. I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t mean over here, when they ever come to Israel. The Dutch like to go to Israel, so they do come. And when he goes to Holland, he always visits that family. And 1t was most amazing how close they really had gotten."

My father -- Manfred offered -- he -- he offered the papers and my mother Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection said -- got -- got him the money.

And I did the cooking and I did the cleaning and I worked very hard, so did he -- I mean so did we all, so did his sister, who turned out to be as important -- maybe not more important than he was. He -- after the war, as I said, I -- I knew I wasn\u2019t going to marry him and we split up. I lived -- went to live somewhere else. I had met Otmar through Manfred, really. And although I wasn\u2019t sure there was any future in there, I lived by myse -- I went and got an apartment somewhere else, which was great luck that I could even find anything after the war. And then of course, my Uncle Paul came back and Heinz came back and they were the two anchors, you know, that I had, even though they were so busy with themselves, you can\u2019t imagine.

And to work as hard physically as I had to work, took all I had and a bit more, you know? We started to have a little bit better food. It took a long time for the food to come in. And although I had not been as hungry as most people had for as long -- because in the end we were very hungry, I still was really underfed.

What happened was that Marty really was in Brussels that year, for six -- for six months and we -- we were going to be in Brussels and my family then, Heinz and Ava said, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, you know, you\u2019re going to be in bru -- in Europe for the first time with all your kids, we want to see your kids, you know. Don\u2019t go to Brussels.\u201d You know, then -- this too far. So, the house that we had was just two blocks from them and that was really nice. I mean it was -- it was unbelievable to be back in Holland with my own kids. I shopped in the same stores for them. I took them to Amsterdam, of course -- we were in the Hague. But I had known the Hague very well. Uncle Paul was in Vosinar, which is -- which is between the Hague and Amsterdam. I mean, it was -- for me it was one of the best years I could ever remember. I mean, imagine I went to stores in Amsterdam, met some company where we used to shop and -- and there was -- an aunt of mine was sitting there, and -- was an aunt of my mother\u2019s really, was sitting there. \u201cBarbara,\u201d she says, \u201chow are you?\u201d I mean, this doesn\u2019t\u2019 happen to me in the States. I mean, it was just -- 1t was a wonderful year. I -- I ended up -- we -- you know, I had so much family that was still living there and many of them are dead. My uncle\u2019s dead, his wife is dead. You know, and etcetera. My cousins are alive. So I do go there and I visit with them."
