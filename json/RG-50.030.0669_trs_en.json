            "answer": "I will start with my grandfather, my father's father, who started out as a Jewish peddler with atray around his neck selling stuff from it, and he walked from what is now Czechoslovakia to Hamburg and established an export/import business and got very rich and very successful. Fortunately, he died before the Nazis could take away all his money and his houses. And it was really his money that provided my parents with the money to -- they were school people. They always had boarding schools. And they got the money from my grandfather to do it. My mother was one of the very early physicians and became a psychoanalyst. She studied with Dr. Freud, and he became friends of the family. I remember that his daughter, Anna Freud, was also a psychoanalyst, used to come and visit frequently and was aclose friend of my mother -- of my mother's. So that that's how -- then my father had a PhD in Art History, and they decided to go into education. They believed in what was then a very novel idea and progressive idea that they would have a co-educational boarding school. And as the school grew, they moved from one place tothe other until they finally ended up in aplace called Mariendahl (ph), which was a large school, became a large school. I went to school there with about 200 students, and the school still exists in --"

            "answer": "No, this is in -- it's also in Hamburg, but it's a different place. Gunderstein was the second school they had, and then Mariendahl was the third one. After that, of course, the Nazis came in 1933, and my parents were both Jewish, so it was clear that this wasn't going to last very long, and for awhile the school continued because we had the Nazi minister of education's daughter in the school."

We have too lovely poodles who are guarding Mr. Bondy, and we have achoice of whether or not they are inthe room and bark, or whether they're here and just have a low-level growl. So for ambient audio noise, we have preferred the latter choice. So just to give future people who, you know, future listeners, an idea of why the growling is there; it's friendly growling.",

He was wounded in the first world war. I guess that's how he met my mother was studying medicine in Vienna. And he was transferred, and at one point in order to be near her joined what was called the Camel Corps, and I guess it was what is today Palestine. | Ofcourse, one of the problems that comes with being in a boarding school is that you share your parents with alot of people. Of course, we didn't know any other -- any -- anything else. We had a Bavarian -- I guess she wasn't a nurse -- caretaker, who took care of us while they were busy. All I can remember about her is that she was extremely Catholic, while we were probably extremely nonreligious and, but she was very nice and stayed with us till we left."
