Come\nfrom a educated middle class kind of family.\nMy father was in the flax export business.\nHe bought flax from the local farmers,\ngraded it, sorted it and bailed it and then\nshipped it to Ire land, Czechoslovakia, or\nany place that used manufactured linen. I\nwas an only child in, amongst a family of\nabout 2 sets of aunts, an uncle and my\nparents, my grandmother. I was the only so\nas a result I was badly spoiled. I had a, a\nmaid that took care of me and I had a, I was\nbrought up like a little prince in some re-\nspect.

We lived in avery nice house. We had\na whole floor of a three story house. I had\nmy own room overlooking the river that\npassed through the town, saw ships going by\nall the time and as a result I still like\nthem, I am now involved in sailing. Sundays\nand weekends I remember being taken at a\nlittle ferry across the bay from where we\nlived, was a place called Zancove and we\nwere again, I would be taken with my family\nto, and lots of older people always to cafes\nand I really did not have much opportunity\nto play with other children because I was\nalways entertained with adults somehow. It\nwas just a very pleasant life in general.\nSB: And then, when, how did things start to\nchange. What do you remember that you saw\nand you heard.\nIS: Well first of all we had the radio at\nhome and my father would be glued to the\nradio.

I don't\nknow exactly the date, but Hitler invaded,\ntook over Memel and that's before the war\nwith Russia started. And we had to move to\nLithuania proper. And my parents even\nthough we lived in Lithuania, had German\ncitizenship and we were not allowed for some\nodd reason to live in the capital of\nLithuania which was Kovno or Kaunas at the\ntime. So we ended up first in Siaulilai and\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We lived in very\ncramped quarters and in the back yard near\nmy father somehow, either competition or a\ncolleague in the business. And things just\nchanged drastically. However my school I\ncontinued going to the same type of a\nsecular Hebrew private school in Panevezys\nand, and kept getting this rather\ninteresting education. I also remember and\nthis must have been I must have been ten at\nthe time, the day the Russians invaded\nLithuania and the tanks coming through and\nthe first time I saw people from other, I\nsaw Khirghiz who looked like Chinese people\nand, and so as a child for me this was a\ngreat thing to see, all these tanks rolling\nthrough town. But I could, my father even\nthough he was a German citizen, was born in\nRussia and escaped prior or just after the\nrevolution and was very. I think he was\nmore concerned at the time of what the\nRussians would do to him than what the\nGermans might do to him. So he, he was\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then\nwhen the Russians came again being German\ncitizens they did not want us to live in the\nprovinces so they made us to go Kovno or\nKaunas proper. And now the whole family, 2\naunts and another uncle and\nwe all got crammed into even tighter\nquarters. In Kovno. Under the Russians.\nThe russians did not allow Hebrew or Yiddish\nOr any sort of education that was other than\nLithuanian or Russian so I was put into a\nLithuanian school and I didn't know what was\ngoing on at all because I didn't speak\nLithuanian. In Memel you could get by with\nGerman which is what we spoke and Russian\nwhich my father spoke with his sisters. Um.\nAgain as a child you have funny experiences.\nI mean in this house that we lived in the\nback yard Russian soldiers were quartered\nand once I knew enough Russian, anda\nRussian soldier calls me over and he says\nyou want to have a smoke in Russian, hochet\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But I\nalways saw my parents and, and talk in\nhushed voices, and Ivar 1S coming, stop\ntalking. And you know this, this kind of\nstuff. I still remember. So even though I\ndidn't, wasn't told specific details of what\nwas going on, I sensed the fear and the, the\nworry of my parents at that point. And then\nthe next thing, once the Germans had invaded\nit didn't take long. I and I don't quite\nremember how but the next thing I know is I,\nI'm in a ghetto and now we are really\ncramped. Maybe the whole family in a room,\none or two rooms. And that's again the two\naunts, an uncle. And interestingly enough\nthere was a refugee from Germany to\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And he was a German Jew\nwho knew his way around with the Germans.\nAnd he had, he was married to an non Jewish\nwoman who maintained he was a rather wealthy\nguy. He lived with us and he sort of became\nlike a protector of the family because he\nwas involved in the, in the I don't really\nthe administration of the ghetto. And, and\nwas friendly with the Germans knew how to\nbribe them. And so but anyway things were\nreally crowded, tight. I always had enough\nfood because I guess as a child they gave me\nall the food that they didn't have, that the\nothers didn't have. So this protective life\nin a way continued for me.

Were you afraid.\nIS: You know my reaction was always in watching my\nparents and, and my surroundings because\nmuch was hidden from me. I was at the time\nabout 10 and 11 years old. And I could see\nof course by the way my parents were that,\nthat they were in a constant state of fear\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And so I was of course\nfrequently not allowed out on my own or at\nall. There were, there was obviously a\nshortage of food, although we were not\nstarving yet. It was not at a point where\nand I know that my mother always finagled\nsomething and food ended up on the table\nsomehow, but the food I mean there was no\nmeat, there was always this well I remember\nlike fake, fake chopped liver made out of\npeas and things like that. Today that's\nconsidered good. And so but as a child I\nalso remember occasionally when things\ncalmed down in the ghetto, I would be\nallowed out and I would have friends and we\nwould go play and we would play soccer. And\nyou know as a child we tried to maintain\nthings in, in as normal a fashion and my\nparents sort of helped me in that.

I mean I remember having to,\nbeing given a large block of steel and\nhaving to file the thing til it's perfectly\nSquare on all the corners. You begin with a\nbig block and you finally end up with\nsomething rather small. I remember having to\nhand fashion a lock and make it out of\nmetal. And then we did some routine work. I\nwould guess some production for the Germans.\nThis 1S you know from what I understand in\nretrospect is that because I was in this\nworkshop during some of the selections or so\non, while these were occurring I waS ina\nworkshop and worked and therefore was not so\nthis was something that eventually helped me\nSave, save my life. And yet as kids we, we\ndid nonsense too. Right\nin, in this ghetto. I mean we, we, we they\nhad welding equipment and there was some,\nsome material called carbide, which is not\nthe same as carbide here. If you mixed it\nwith snow in the winter and threw matches in\nit and the darned thing would explode you\nknow. And I mean I think we made believe we\nwere fighting the Germans with that. It was\nof course silly. Um. Of course at, at the\nbeginning, it's, it's I remember as things\nwent on frequently being, being hidden. We\nhad a hidden chamber in the house which was\nbehind like a big chest that was, was a very\nnarrow passage between two\nThis is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And there were in the house that we\nlived in\nthere were I don't know there were at least\n4 or 5 other families crammed in and in this\nduring the summer of the selections I was\ndown there. Um. And there were I mean maybe\nI was 12 at this point and we were told to\nbe absolutely quiet. yet there was a woman\nthere with a baby and the baby would cry and\nyou know and this was where this guy Carl\nNatkin came into the picture. The, during\nthe selections apparently one person was\nalways allowed to stay in the house. Sort\nof to watch it or something. And when the\nGermans came by he spoke perfect German and\nhe, he bribed them with alcohol and whatever\nelse and, and the Germans would just come in\nand, and very quickly leave the house. So in\na way this guy protected us and probably I\nowe my life amongst many other people to him\nalso. Um. The, the worst thing that I\nremember was the hanging where everybody had\nto show up and I didn't remember the cause\nbut. I mean this was the first time I really\nsaw, I must have been 12 or so at that time.\nPeople just being hung and you had to you\nknow the whole, the whole ghetto was in this\nopen field and had to watch that. And I\nthink at that point things really dawned on\nme that things were not just bad but\nhorrible. Um.\nSB: What about the Knight fort.

Did you, were you ever\nable to do anything.\nIS: No, I think my parents and mainly we\ndepended very much on this Carl Natkin who\nwas a bit of a wheeler dealer and he, he\nbrought in the food and, and arranged that\nboth my uncle and my father were on work\ndetails which were, I don't know if they\nwere in better or worse but they certainly\nwas involved in that. And so I, I do not\nremember that personally.\nSB: And what about books and school.\nIS: That's interesting. My mother was\neducated in Germany and she brought into the\nghetto a lot of books and she made me read\nGoethe and Schiller and, and so I as a child\nknew here the Germans were persecuting us\nand at the same she taught, those were the\nbooks she had so that's what she made me\nread.

So and then my\nmother, my mother continued teaching me\nmathematics and whatever she could. And of\ncourse I was in this workshop where I learned\nthe machine shop trade sort of. And so I, my\neducation I mean it was not education in the\nclass, in the traditional sense but it sort\nof continued. At\nleast, at least until about just until the\nbar mitzvah. After that things started to\nreally deteriorate in the ghetto. I mean\nthere were frequent selections and I started\nto become more cognizant of what was going on\nand um so .\nSB: And when was that. When was the bar\nmitzvah.\nIS: Well that would have been in August of\n1947, 1943.
