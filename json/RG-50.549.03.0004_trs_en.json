This interview is conducted by Regina Baier on February 9, 2001, in Springfield, New Jersey. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, my first question is, would you tell us your name?",
            "answer": "My name now is Norman Salsitz, but this is not the original name. So if you ask me from before, I was born as Naftali Saleschutz. And the Saleschutz is a very long name for America, so we changed it to Salsitz. But during the war I had a few other names, in the way for each -- for each time. During the war my name first was Tadeusz Jadach, a Polish name, then it was Tadeusz Zaleski, and then also it was Anatoli Sherbakovy, which is a Russian name. Then it was also Lazarus Spillman, it was a German name. And when I came to America, we change it to Salsitz, and I\u2019m still Salsitz, and I hope it will be Salsitz til I die."

            "question": "-- at one point. Who were you, and those different names.",
            "answer": "Yeah, now when I was born Naftali Saleschutz, of course they had to give me a name when I was born. I had a lot of names, not orig -- not names, legally names, people called me all kind of names because I was not an angel when I was small. My family called me different, my friends called me different. During the war, when I escaped from the camp and I started -- I escaped to the woods, I had to -- I got false -- it\u2019s -- oh, actually, it was not false, it was a real birth certificate from a monsignor and he gave me the name -- I picked out the name because the -- the name belonged to a friend of mine who went with me to school, and dur -- 1939 he was in the army, he was killed. And I picked out his name because he s -- he -- we looked very much alike, like we would be brothers. And his name was Tadeusz Jadach. It\u2019s a very good Polish name. So I asked the monsignor, so he gave me his birth certificate and I started to masquerade when I was in the underground in the woods, as Tadeusz Jadach. Then, during this time, I also belonged to a Russian group, a Russian partisan groups for a short time. So there I got the other document in my name as Naftali in Russia, su- supposed to be Anatoli, it\u2019s changed. So I liked Anatoli, so I got a paper as 3 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 Sherbakov, which is a real Russian name, so I became Anatoli Sherbakov. Then, when I d -- was liberated, and I joined the Polish army, and the Polish army didn\u2019t want me to have the same name as I had in the underground, as Tadeusz Jadach, because there was all political mis -- they didn\u2019t believe in the same ideology, so I changed the name to Tadeusz Zaleski, it should be similar to my original name Saleschutz, so it became Zaleski. It could be Saleschutz but spelled different like in Polish, because the real Saleschutz was spelled like a German name. But then people were afraid that it -- my superiors, that it will have a connection with my name from before, so they said let\u2019s have a new name, so Tadeusz was okay, it\u2019s a good Polish name, so I became Tadeusz Zaleski. Then later when I was in the -- in the Polish army, I was in the intelligence, and I had special -- you -- in a special unit, so for a certain time I had to be -- to have a German name, because we had to interduce -- to in -- interrogate German officers, but there is a long story in my book about it, so I had a friend, his name was Lazarus Spillman, so I made out documents that I am Lazarus Spillman. And when I came to America -- so I came -- I got back to my real name, Naftali Saleschutz, but for America the Saleschutz was too long. People don\u2019t have time to spell, everybody ask how do you spell it. So because I had a brother in America and his name was Salsitz, so I change it to Salsitz. And Naftali they thought is a too Jewish name, so I became Norman, which I\u2019m sorry til today because I like 4 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 Naftali much better than Norman, and this is how I remain. So do -- this is -- this is my name."

But I would like you to talk about- about Krakow. Why did you go to Krakow, when did you go, and what position did you have? I want to talk about the whole Krakow scene [indecipherable]",
            "answer": "Yeah. Whe -- when I went into the Polish army after I was liberated -- I was liberated in the beginning of August 1944, and I right away wanted to go to the army because I figured if I survived the war, I have to fight the Germans, and this was my aim, because my father\u2019s last words was, Nakuma, nakuma, nakuma. It means revenge, revenge, revenge, take revenge. I figured how can I take revenge? I have to be in the army in a special unit. And then I was sent to a -- from a -- in --in -- the government was in Lublin, the Polish government, temporary government, because Warsaw was not liberated, and then later I was sent from Lublin to Szeszow, because Szeszow was a bigger town near my town, Kolbuszowa, and I know Szeszow -- I knew Szeszow and I knew the surrounding and I knew the people there. So I was in this time -- we call it informatsia voickowa, which means -- this was the political unit 5 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 in the army. It was -- so a -- when then -- the 12\" of January, 1945, was the left -- the less [indecipherable] towards Berlin, towards the -- take over Germany, because in Szeszow, when I was liberated, the front stopped, the front stopped in August. And for six months nothing happened, they stayed in one place, and they made all the preparations for the final push. The January the 12\" the war started -- I mean, the [indecipherable] started towards the west, and this was actually the last [indecipherable] til the war was ended. Now I was picked out -- in this time they picked out a group f-fo -- of hundred young, mostly officers, and we were assigned to go with the Russian front. As the Russian front went, we went right with them, and from the hundred, soon as a town was liberated, some of us remained in the town to establish a Polish presence, and to start to organize -- organize security, and -- and civil offices. So each town had some people left, two or three. I was assigned to do the same thing, but til we will re -- reach Krakow. When we reach Krakow -- so from the hundred remained maybe 50 or 60, and we came into Krakow, and I was assigned to the same units, which was the military -- the military intelligence, but my si -- my par - there were a lot of sections. People had the section with the clergy, people had the section with the civil organization. I -- my section was that I had to do with Germans who lived in Poland, or who remained in Poland, or Polish people who collaborated with the Germans -- and they changed during the occupation, they made out papers 6 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 that they are ethnic Germans. And because I spoke German, so I was attached to this unit, and also we had a lot of German prisoners of war, so I interrogated them, and this is how I became the head of the county f -- of Krakow for this reason, for this purposes."

            "question": "But I would like to talk about afterwards, so what -- so when -- once you had taken care of the columns, that was disconnected, the -- Krak\u00e9w was saved, what were the other jobs? You had a lot of work to do. What was basically ho -- what did you work, and -- and what was the situation in Krakow, and what did you do?",
            "answer": "Well, Krak\u00e9w was -- luckily Krakow was not touched. It was not destroyed y -- like other towns. Like Warsaw for instance, was 90 percent destroyed. Krakow was not destroyed and this is in the book with this -- it had to be destroyed because the Germans prepared for a destruction, and they prepared 287 colu -- places where -- were mined, and the 287 I remember distinctly because this was our main em -- th -- main thing to eliminate those things. So Krakow wasn\u2019t destroyed, but our -- our da -- duty, what we had to do the first thing, we had to clin -- to get rid of the people who 7 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 collaborated with the Germans. Mostly Germans they left, the army left, but there were some who remained. But the people who collaborated, now they were Polish people, but during the German occupation they made out papers, and they find ways that their grandfather was from Germany, or great grandfather was a colonist. And e -- sometimes even if 1t was not true. They wanted to do it, why? Because doing this they became ethnic Germans, and the German gave them bigger ration cards, they could get a nicer apartment and they could get a good job. Even the Polish people who were sent away to concentration camps, and they were -- didn\u2019t have the rice, they had more rice, and they were the elite during the German occupation. Now, as the Germans left, those people tried to be back Poles, because actually they were Poles, they were traitors. So naturally our aim was to find out, to interrogate them, and to find them. If they came from different towns, if they started having new papers. So mostly this was our aim, and this was also for the security of the government not to have enemies in our place. So this was the main things that we had to have. Then I got an -- a special job. This was -- now we occupied Krakow, officially occupation was the 19\" of January, 1945. This was official date. I was two days before in Krakow, but this was the official date when Krakow was occupied do -- by the Russian army. And -- and the only Polish unit was our unit that we came in and that we were the -- the first who were in Krakow, and the people looked up to us that we are the liberators. In beginning, or 1-1- 8 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 in th -- in beginning of February, a group came from England, and this was the -- organization to study the crimes of the Germans. And the head of this group was Hewlett Johns -- Johnson. He was the Dean of Canterbury from England. He was a archbishop and he was the head. And he had in his group mostly professors from different universities, from countries who were not a g -- who -- who didn\u2019t work with the Germans. Like in Europe a lot of countries collaborated, and they had armies like Hungary, Romania. Those were professors from places that they were always against the Germans, or the Germans were occupying their countries. We had professors from Russia, from England, from -- from Argentina, from all over the world. And I was assigned that I was to prepare -- I had to prepare every day\u2019s activity for this group where to go. We went to all concentration camps, to -- like for instance, in Auschwitz, we were in Auschwitz maybe two weeks after Auschwitz was liberated. Everything was fresh. The de -- the destruction of the crematoriums, they we -- still were hot from- from -- from fire. The clothing of the people that they were -- were killed, and they were still, the blood was still soft, because it wasn\u2019t dry up. And then th-the -- the warehouses from children\u2019s shoes, and eyeglasses, and [indecipherable] and all those thing. This was just in the beginning. And we found in Auschwitz also, about 20 to thir -- 25,000 people who couldn\u2019t be sent out with the death marches like they did before the Russians occupied. So I went with this group for about four, five weeks. 9 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 Every day we -- the headquarters were in Krakow in the hotel, and my job was to prepare the itinerary for the next day. Where to go, how to go, to have the cars and the transportation for the group. And because I spoke a little English, so they picked me out and I was the one that I explained to the man who was in charge of transportation from the Dean of Canterbury, and with him, too, and I brought them over to all those places. During the times that we went to the concentration camps, there was a other aim, was the Polish government wanted, is to show them how the people are very happy with the communists who came in. Now this, everything was staged, nothing was the truth. Th -- th -- the -- Hewlett Johnson, the archbishop later had a nickname, the Red Dean, because everything -- he was very much pro-Russia. When he went, for instance to Korea in this -- later, and always he went to investigate, but he always was pro-Russia. So what my -- my job was to -- to stage -- like, for instance, we went to a place, to a concentration camp. On the spo -- on the way, when we saw there a group of Polish peasants, and they were dressed in the Polish traditional clothing, which 1 -- this was all staged. So I said to him, \u201cWell, let\u2019s find out, let\u2019s stop and find out from the people what they think about the new regime.\u201d Because they started to take away land from the landowners, and gave them away to the peasants. So we stopped, and I asked them in Polish, and it was translated. Now those were not peasants that we met occa -- special we met. Those were people who were told to be on this spot, dressed Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 10 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 like peasants and they had all kind of m -- pitchforks and other things what peasants use. And I said to him, oh there are peasants, it\u2019s good to find out. Now, they were prepared, those were people who were from the government. Tho -- there were -- who belonged to the communist eg -- organizations. And they were prepared what they will be asked, and what they should a -- was -- wa -- should answer. And naturally all of them said how happy they are, that before the war they were discriminated, the peasants. And now they come in and the government is so good for the peasants. And they took away from the very rich people, who never took care on their fields, and they divided, they gave. And she -- they praised -- they praised there the [indecipherable]. And this was everything -- naturally they made the film, and they made pictures, and this was later shown in -- in newsreels, how the Polish population, the peasants are very, very happy with it. But this -- everything was staged."

            "question": "I want to ask you just one more question about Krakow. You also were involved to some degree in -- in food and relief efforts, right, because [indecipherable] people were coming back",
            "answer": "Yeah, I was -- not officially. Officially I couldn\u2019t be ra -- 1-involved because the first thing, I was not a Jew. I -- in this time I was not -- Tadeusz Zaleski, a Polish Catholic. And the second thing, our job was not to -- to give food to the people, to help people. Our job was to find out collaborators and other things, but through my future 11 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 wife, because I started to bring her food right the next day when I met her, because there -- there was no -- you couldn\u2019t buy food, and people didn\u2019t have food. So I use -- and we had everything, because in the army we had everything, so I use -- I took my adjutant or some, and I used to send to her every day, bread and salami and butter and other things. Now, when the people who came out from hiding -- you didn\u2019t have yet people from concentration camps, because it took a few weeks til they started to come in. But people came out from hiding, they were hungry, and they were -- they were in hiding for -- for two years, for y -- year and a half. They find out that there 1s a -- somebody who survived and he is Jewish and he has food. So they started to come to her and asked her for -- for -- for food, and she was glad to give it to them. Now, as she gave them the food, naturally, she notified me. I didn\u2019t see her so often in the beginning. She notified me she needs more, she needs more, and I n -- not officially, sent her all kind, and she just -- and she gave it away. Also, I gave her a lot of clothing. As we took over a lot of apartments, where Germans left, or people who were collaborators were arrested, we confiscated their apartments, and we had all the things from their apartments, so I could give it to her, and she used to distribute to the people who came ba -- with their -- with their concentration clothing -- they didn\u2019t -- it was winter, because this was in January, February, it was very cold. So I gave it to her and I was very happy and the people find out, and wa -- once somebody find out, there Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 12 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 were more and more and more, [indecipherable] I gave it her, she gave it -- she give it- give it away, and I was very happy I could do it, unofficially. Then later I also find out that there was a woman, and there 1s a film made about it. They called it, \u201cMy Hundred Children.\u201d And this woman collected children who were left for -- fo -- after fa -- they were hidden, and also a lot of Polish people who took in the children to hide, and they were promised money after the war, and then later they find out that the parents are killed, nobody came back, so they abandoned the children. And the children didn\u2019t have where to go. So the Jewish co -- committee started to collect those children, there was one woman special, and she is in -- in the book th -- what they wrote, \u201cMy Hundred Children.\u201d She collected chil -- she lost all her family, so she collected those children and brought them into the Jewish committee, and they were on- they had that [indecipherable], but she didn\u2019t had wa -- what -- how to feed them. So she find out about me, because when I came to Krakow, and I went right away to two leaders of Krakow, one was -- his name was -- he was involved with the Jewish committee, he was a lawyer before the war, his name was Stulbackt. And then it was a rabbi who survived the war, not from Krakow, but he kra -- remained, and he was in Krakow, and he was like the official rabbi. His name was Steinberg. So I came to them and I told them, \u201cListen, I am a Jew. Nobody knows that I am a Jew, but I want you should know. Any time you have a problem, and I am in the government, and I 13 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 have a big position. If you need something, please tell me, not official, and I will do what I can do.\u201d In this what I -- they always came to me and the brought me problems, and -- and I have -- and now -- in -- in my new books that I writing now, \u201cTreasure of Jewish Memories,\u201d I\u2019m describing those episodes fr -- from the -- what a -- for -- from this time. So when -- when I find out that the children are there, they didn\u2019t have what to wear, they didn\u2019t have what to eat, so I sco -- I-I couldn\u2019t give them money, and I -- so we had a lot of sugar. And because sugar the Germans th -- had the sugar in warehouses and we took it over. So I told this woman, I cannot give you money, but if you have a truck -- I cannot deliver it -- you can come and pick out and I can give you as much sugar as you want, and later you sell the sugar. So this way they could support themselves. Then later they needed some clothing. And we took away from Germany two large warehouses, because the Germans had warehouses for underwear, shirts and other things, for the Germans, because everything was on ration cards. Now the Poles didn\u2019t get anything, but the Germans got -- oh, and those were I find out where the warehouses are, because when the germ -- before the Germans left, they put all this material in two houses in basements. They were big basements because this was a whole [indecipherable] and I find out about it. So we went and we confiscated everything. So I had a lot of this material. I remember there were children\u2019s socks, and children\u2019s underwear, and everything what -- so -- so I brought -- every time I came 14 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 over to them, so I brought a trunk full of those things and I gave it to them. Now, they knew that I am Jewish, those few people, but the rest, they didn\u2019t know. And when I took it out from the warehouses, the people who work with me, they didn\u2019t know why I take it away. Maybe they thought maybe I take it and I sell it on black market or something. But I gave it away all to my girlfriend, or to the Jewish committee."

                " I think this was the best time of my -- there were two times that there were the best times of my life. And I think this was the best time. One time was the best time when I- like for instance, when I was in the woods, naturally we starved, it was cold, and it was terrible fear. But if we could do something -- there was one time that we made a raid of -- o-on -- we made a raid, there was a -- a sop -- police station from Puskov, from the SS, and we made the raid, and we killed them, all of them, so I think this was the happiest day in my life. As a matter of fact in my book there, somebody wrote, and in th -- in -- and what I explained to him it 1s -- it was like when I had the machine gun in my hand, it\u2019s like a lame who couldn\u2019t walk, and suddenly he -- he -- he was able to walk. To me, that I was not any more the victim, that I wasn\u2019t any more the pe -- the person who was killed, that I could pay back. And this was my life why I wanted to 15 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 live. To take revenge, which I did as much as possible. In Krakow, it was a other, naturally we couldn\u2019t go out, we couldn\u2019t kill people any more, it was after the war. But for me to see that the people, the Jewish came ba -- the Jews came back, they had nothing, they di -- and even the Polish government was not very, very friendly with them, because individual -- maybe the government as a whole was not anti-Semitic, because in this time it was a communist government, but each individual policeman, each individual clerk, everything, he had this hate in his heart as again the same thing, they didn\u2019t change. Now, if I could do something, I was very happy. People that I didn\u2019t know, they find out -- they find out that -- that they could do -- through me they went to this rabbi, and if I could help them I was very happy. And also, also, if they needed apartments, and there was every apartment, usually there was a -- a office where they gave out the apartments. Now, if a Jew came for an apartment and even he lived before in Krakow, they wouldn\u2019t give it to him because the people were very, very against Jews. And they said, \u201cWell, why did you come back?\u201d And they looked at that Jew -- and now I\u2019m writing a new book about the killings after the war, so the title of the book is what they used to say in the title 1s, you are still alive? I -- and the subtitle is, I thought they killed all of you. This was the first question -- the first that a Pole ask a Jew when he survived. But when -- when -- when they went to this rabbi and the rabbi knew that he could be helped through me, I did it. Now this was a very, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 16 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 very rewarding thing for me. Because if I started a thing, we were killed, and nobody did anything. And this time we were undress -- I\u2019m not talking I personally, but the Jews, and we were undr -- dress over a -- a -- a ditch, and we were killed. Now if e- each one of them would think, if I would live and if I could pay them back, everybody will do it. Now, after the war, people didn\u2019t do it. The war is ended, and everybody was interested to have a bread, to make a living, and to save his family if he had a family. But for me, I survived for two reasons -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B ",
                " -- for me, I survived for two reasons. And this, to -- to survive, you had to have a legacy, you had to have a reason. Th-This gave you strength, otherwise you couldn\u2019t survive. And I had two. One was when my father was killed, he yelled to take revenge, and | -- it is now 55 - 60 years later, I still hear his si -- his screams. This was one that gave me strength. I have to live, because I was the youngest, and I was the only one to pay back, pay back for my five sisters, pay back for my -- the sister\u2019s husbands, pay back for my nieces and nephews. Who would pay back? So this mean that they were killed, and nothing will happen to the people who did it. So this was one legacy that it gave me strength. To take back the second one was when my mother was taken away to Belzec with my five sisters to be killed in Belzec, she somehow gave to somebry -- 17 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 body a letter, and I got the letter from this person. I was in [indecipherable] and she wrote to me, you are my ninth child, you are the youngest. You are young, you are strong, you are smart. If somebody will survive, you will survive. Because she believes that somebody will survive. She said, \u201cAfter the war, go to your brother,\u201d because I had a brother in Palestine, \u201cgo to y -- Palestine, go to your brother,\u201d I had a brother in America, \u201cand tell the whole world what the German murderers did to us.\u201d So this is the reasons that after the war, I started to tell, even in the beginning people didn\u2019t want to listen. But I spoke, and they thought I have an obsession, some people didn\u2019t like it. Later, 20 years later, st -- people started to realize, and they listened. Books came out, movies came out. But I started to speak the first minute I left Poland, and I told the stories. And people thought that it is something wrong with me. And this gave me strength to survive. That if we will not be alive, the whole world would know what a cruel thing happened 1n this time.

In Krak\u00e9w wa -- I was the head for the county. In Breslau I was for the town. And again the same story, in Breslau | had a lot of work, because Breslau, first thing Breslau was 90 percent or 85 percent destroyed, and there were a lot of Germans, and we wanted the Polish people should come in, and they should show that there is -- this became a Polish town, and a- and we then -- later we gave out in orders that all the Germans have to leave. Now they left, and they had two suitcases, and this was something for me very, very important, because this was a pay back what they did to the Jews. Naturally they -- when they were sent out, when we brought them to the train, we didn\u2019t kill them th -- like in the -- in the Szeszow where I was and one day they killed 6,000 Jews, sik -- 600 Jews, then thousand Jews, by an aktia -- we call it a aktia, it means an [indecipherable]. But by the Germans nobody was killed, they only had to leave. Now the -- their apartments were taken over by Polish people, and in -- in -- in -- but -- but one thing we s -- in this time also, the -- it started in Israel, we knew -- Palestine in 19 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 this time, and we knew Palestine will have to -- the Jews will try to have their own country. And as -- I always was a Zionist. I never became a member of the communist party, even they ask me to do it. But my excuse was that I am not in th -- [ -- Iam not taught enough to know the ide -- the ideology about communism, I have to learn a little more, I have to read more and this was my excuse. And my wife never wanted to stay, because my wife had very bad experience, because when the Russians came in to the -- her town in Stanislav -- in Stanislavov in 1940 -- in 1939, and they lived under co-communist regime, now the people who were well off were middle class [indecipherable] middle class they were -- th-th-the Russians tried to liquidate them. If they were Zionists they sent them to Siberia, if they were rich they took away everything. So from them they took away their apartment, they took away the business. Her father had to be a plain worker, which -- my wife wanted to study medicine, they didn\u2019t let her in because she was a daughter of a bourge -- bourgeois family. So she sa -- and then they saw the system 1s not for her, so she didn\u2019t want to stay in Poland. And she always said, well in Poland you got a king for a night, but the end we -- I don\u2019t want. So we started to think -- and I also, when I was in Breslau, I start -- well, even in Krakow, I started to work in that organization, a Zionist organization. Naturally the people from the organization knew that I am Jewish, and I gave them some protection, and they had to -- to -- to travel toward the 20 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 Czechoslovakian border, I helped them. And also, when I was in Breslau, I was still involved with this organization, and -- and -- and -- but -- but the end was that we had to leave, til 1t came a time that my wife said she ha -- we have to leave because the longer we will wait, it will be harder to -- to go away. Now, I left first, and I left very - not organize in [indecipherable] because I went with that -- with a truck, through the border to East Germany, and on the way I could be caught, I we -- but it\u2019s a long story, but I left."

            "answer": "Yo -- well, my th -- my thought -- well, see, the first thing my wife wanted to leave, of course, she had family in pales -- in is -- in Palestine at this time. She had a grandmother, she had a sister, she has three uncles with her family. So she said, well she had somebody. And I wanted to leave because I saw, even now -- I have a good position and everything, but I had to masquerade. I wanted to be myself. I -- why should I -- if we have a free country, and if we -- the communist regime is so equal, no anti-Semitic, why do I have to hide my identity? Why do I have to be Tadeusz Zaleski? Why can\u2019t I be myself? And also, being a non-Jew, the people who work with me, the people who were in the government didn\u2019t have no secrets because I was one of them. So then I could see that deep in -- imbedded anti-Semitism towards Jews. 21 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 And nobody was a friend sp -- in those -- in this time. Even officially they couldn\u2019t go out and say, well I hate Jews, and this and that, but inside everybody was anti-Semite. Now, 1n the -- there were no secrets from me, so I saw that this will not be a life for me, and also my wife always said that the end will be -- see, in Russia, in the Russian system there were three kinds of people. People who were in jail, people -- pe -- he -- people who were in jail, people who are in jail, and people who will be 1n jail. So the end was I -- I didn\u2019t care how big I was, the end was if I do something -- something wrong, see, if I would be a -- a [indecipherable] if I would be a -- a communist, and I will like the regime, and I [indecipherable], so then I would say, well this is my life, and I love it. I wasn\u2019t -- I come from a very Orthodox, ultra-Orthodox home. Reet -- not, I wouldn\u2019t say millionaires, but a very comfortable home. We were -- we were considered 10 percent of the richest people in our town. And the whole family was very religious, so I was not brought up to be against religion, or to hate people who have money or make a living. I did it because it was comfortable for me in this time. The war ended, I wanted to take revenge, and I could have a job to be acknowledged, but not as a Jew, so this was very bad for me. So I knew that the end would be I will not be there. But longer my w -- my wife was very smart, she said, longer we will wait, worse it be to come out. And naturally I went out first, and she remained and she was arrested because they thought through her they will get me. So -- but I never, 22 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 never had my mind, because this was not a regime for me. Now, we want to go to Palestine. I was registered, and I worked with that group called Bricha. Bricha was the one who took out people, and they smuggled them to Italy and from Italy to Palestine. Now, from Poland the Bricha went over to Germany, from Germany to Italy. Now, unofficially I belonged to them, because my dream was to be in Palestine. Because even when I was home before the war I wanted to go to Palestine. But then later we escaped and we came to Germany. In Germany there was other -- other problem to go to Palestine because you couldn\u2019t go officially, you had to go illegally, and you wind out in Cyprus in a camp and my wife didn\u2019t want to go to a camp, so we came to America. We said, we will go to America -- which one would come first, Palestine or America, and if America comes first, we\u2019ll go to America, and if we\u2019re in America we can always go to Palestine. And we came to America, and the first money we made in 1949, so we went to Palestine -- to -- it was already Israel, not Palestine.

Because when I went in in a trolley car, and if I saw every German, I looked at every German, I saw in every German I saw that he was the murderer of my father, the murderer of my family. Every German looked to me the same. And I couldn\u2019t stay, so- and I had a lot of problems, because I remember once I went in and in the trolley car, and -- and I was sitting on -- on a seat, and there a woman, a elderly woman came in, and -- and I didn\u2019t get up, and so one young German came in, he says, why don\u2019t Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 24 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 you get up, she\u2019s a old woman, and -- and -- and you are young fellow, why don\u2019t you- so I said well, did somebody get up when my mother came in? My mother was killed. So why should I -- maybe those are the people who killed my -- so we had a argument, then later we had the fight. I remember once we came in in a place and I saw a la -- young Jewish, they fighting with a group of young Germans. I didn\u2019t ask questions, I di -- I didn\u2019t know why. I jumped in. But so happens that I didn\u2019t look Jewish, so the Jewish people started to beat me up. I said, \u201cWhat are you beating me up?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a German?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I am Jewish.\u201d So every day- every day something else. So we di -- we wanted to get out, and we came -- you couldn\u2019t go, you needed that affidavit. So I -- my family didn\u2019t send it to me, so the Joint Distribution, they gave out -- what they did, they didn\u2019t give out individual affidavits, they made a group, let\u2019s say hundred people and one affidavit, and the organization took care to show the government that we will not later stay in the -- in -- in -- and not to make a living. So this is how we came. Even they paid -- they -- the Joint paid for my transportation, for the passage. Then later I paid them back, but they didn\u2019t know if I would pay them back.

In Bremenhaven we were there 1n there they made like a staging area in a school, and the people you were staying there, they gave us to eat, but we couldn\u2019t leave. Now, it was also a very unpleasant place because that ger -- when -- when you got -- when you had to go to get the visa, Germans got the visa very fast. But course, by us, there was in this time, the consul and the co -- they -- they -- they didn\u2019t let the Jewish people who wanted to go to America, they didn\u2019t let them to -- to see the consul. Why? Because they demanded documents, birth certificate, and [indecipherable]. Where did the Jews get documents when they came out from death camps? So every day in the consulate, there were hundreds of Jews waiting that nobody could reach the consul. So there was one secretary and she made a business out of it, and for 200 dollars, she made that you could see the consul. Now people start- who had money started to pay her, and everybody knew that she takes money. Now the first thing we didn\u2019t have the money and we didn\u2019t want to pay, why should we pay her? So because my wife spoke English, I spoke a little English, I said, we have to 26 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 take it in our hand. So there was that general consul, I remember his name was Clarke. And this Clarke, we said we have to see him. So once when he went for lunch, we stopped him. And my wife said she wants to talk to him, and she -- he explained -- she explained to him that it is impossible, there are hundreds of people who want to go to America, and we cannot go because this woman demands 200 dollars for a person to let her see -- and she -- she was a partner with one of the vice- consuls, there was [indecipherable] and she was a partner and she sent it to him and they got im -- they got the visa. So she told this -- everything to the Clarke and I was standing there and he listened and listened. So he said, well I want you should come to my office, and we went there. And we explained, and I remember that when we left, so he came to us and he put the hand on our head. He said, \u201cWell, do you know, children like you we need in America.\u201d And he changed the whole rule. Instead before you needed -- she -- this woman said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the documents, I don\u2019t let -- I don\u2019t make the application.\u201d So he changed the rules, and the rules were you needed two witnesses. And when the two witnesses gave a statement that they know you, you come from this town, and everything, the two witness was -- so everybody got two witnesses. One was a witness for him, then later he was a witness for them. And then the people -- we were -- we ca -- we came them every day. Then later the people knew that we made this change, and they were very happy. Even til today some people who 27 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 are here and they always remind us that we went and we had the guts to speak up. And this way, we -- this woman was fired. They -- the -- the consul -- the visa consul was still there. It so happened that we were assigned -- I remember he had one le -- he was a -- a invalid, so we were assigned to him because the general consul didn\u2019t take care on all the children, so -- on all the people, so we were assigned to him. When we were assigned to him, and -- and he didn\u2019t ask us too many question because we had the two affidavits. Then later he said to raise the hand and he swore us in. So I was afraid because I almost burst out in laughter, because he was the one who was a partner with this woman, and now he is giving me this thing. Well, we got the visa and we had to go to Bremen, in Bremen we got stuck for six months. And then later we went on the- on the liberty ship. Those were the ships, th-the name was Ernie Pyle. This was the last time that the liberty ship, and unlucky we were cause it was in the winter, it was in January, and -- and underw -- underway it was a terrible storm, and the ship, the boiler, everything broke and we almost drowned. And everybody was so sick, that I was laying on the -- on -- on the [indecipherable] the -- the people, the men were in the basement, what maybe 201 in -- in -- in this hole. Now the women were 20 - 25 in their cabin, when -- and I was so sick I was laying out -- outside on the deck. And I pray to God it\u2019s -- the ship should sink. I couldn\u2019t take it, I didn\u2019t eat. So my wife, in this time she put on a woman\u2019s housecoat with the woman\u2019s pajama and the kerchief 28 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 on my head, and she took me in in her room. And the people in her room knew and -- that I am with her and I slept there, and this was a little better. But what -- we were very, very angry that the German people who went to America in this time, cause a lot of German went to America, they had family here, they had the big, best cabins, because they had money to pay. And they -- the people from the company were German, so they had cabins and they were sitting and eating and drinking and dancing. And we were laying like -- like dogs in -- in -- so this was very, very unfair. But this how they came. So mo -- not only on our ship, on all the ships. So the German people had all the privileges because they were normal people and they got people who gave them those places, and they could pay for it. So then we came to -- we came to [indecipherable] we arrived in America January the 17\", and -- and -- and we were so sick. So then later, a night before, somebody said, tomorrow morning we atrive in America. So I -- I as -- how -- as sick we were, everybody di -- dragged out the -- the - the -- the best suit, with the best coat, and we were [indecipherable] and we waited half a night, we were just staying on the deck waiting for the Statue of Liberty. And when the statue of -- when we saw the Statue of Liberty, everybody from us started to cry. Even today [indecipherable] we saw already the Statue of Liberty, and this we -- we are in America. Now wa -- wa -- wa -- this was not the end. Then later when we -- we went that -- they said to take out the valises and everything, so we took it out on the 29 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 deck. Everyone to his initial, N to N, S to S and so on, and then later they came to check. So the American customs, they opened the valises, they [indecipherable]. And we were staying there in -- where -- where the [indecipherable] then a [indecipherable] a heavy set guy in the -- in the -- in the lumber jacket comes in and he goes around and he ask where 1s it, where are the Saleschutz\u2019s? Sa -- so we were very much afraid, maybe -- figured maybe something is wrong, and they would ship us back or something. We didn\u2019t say anything in the beginning and later he said, \u201cWell, their should -- was supposed to be two people with the name Saleschutz,\u201d yeah. So my wife was standing there, and she said, \u201cYes, we are Saleschutz.\u201d And \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d We were so afraid. So he said, \u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d And he got up to my wife and he kissed her, he got up to me, he said, \u201cYou know, I am,\u201d -- and we thought this 1s some official, he said, \u201cI am Yagi, Reisel\u2019s son.\u201d Later he became Jake. In America [indecipherable], \u201cI am Yagi and I find out that you are coming, so I came in here.\u201d Now he could go in -- in the -- yeah, right away, when we were standing, and all the people didn\u2019t know what -- what to think. And he right away called the custom man and the custom came and he didn\u2019t open anything, he just put in a piece of paper on this and he called a longshoreman, and he took the two suitcase we have and put them in. And he -- all the people are waiting, they\u2019re waiting, and we were taken out, and they -- they thought, who knows, that probably we are the 30 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 president of the United States and so on. And we ta -- he took us out in the -- right on the sidewalk when we took us out, a car was waiting and we went in in the car and this was -- my brother was waiting 1n the car, they couldn\u2019t park there, but through him they parked. So we find out later, and w-we said, this Jack he had -- he became Jack, he had a luncheonette on the -- on -- by the docks. And everybody ate by him, and they knew him. And when he find out that we are coming, so he came in and he took us out. Naturally this was a very surprise -- and a pleasant surprise in America. And later we find out he was a very nice fellow. And this is how we arrived. We arrived -- this is the 17\" of January in 1947."

And there was a special in the Hebrew University, there were special courses for American Hebrew teachers. They -- they wanted to -- to make it a higher level. So sh -- we went and we did the train -- this was the first time there was a plane to Israel in \u201949. In the -- before there were no plane -- planes. So we went in the- today, takes six hours to go to Israel. In this time it took us 36 hours. We went -- we stopped in Newfoundland -- Newfoundland, we stopped in Shannon, we stopped in - 46 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 in Switzerland, we stopped in Rome, cause they had to refuel, and -- and then we came to Israel.

And when we were [indecipherable] we started to sing, and -- and then I went down, so I lay -- kneeled down on the ground, and I started to kiss the -- the -- the earth, and we started to cry, and -- and -- and it was -- the family was waiting for us, my wife\u2019s family, my brother was family and they took us home.

Th-The -- the rooms, we had the same room where this Italian guy gave us, and we wanted -- and then it was very bad in Israel. I don\u2019t know if you know what means senna. Senna was a time that -- that everything was on cards, you 47 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 couldn\u2019t buy this, you couldn\u2019t buy this, and the people didn\u2019t made money -- it was a very t-terrib -- because they had all the new immigrants, there was no industry. So we said to -- I -- I said I always wanted to -- to live in Israel, and I -- so we -- so the family got together, and they said, \u201cYou -- you came too late.\u201d Why too late? Would you come when you wanted before the war, I could be very imp-important in the war.

And we then -- what will you do, and you -- says you are in America, you establish yourself a little bit, you making out all right. Go back, make money, send us the money.

And even til today, my biggest regret, if you ask me about regrets in life, my biggest regret 1s that I didn\u2019t go to Israel, not in this time, but before Israel was established.

So he organized this and he got people together, he wanted to organize it here, and to -- equipped -- to be equipped here, and to go to Palestine in this time to fight as a unit. And he -- we worked, and we -- we had meetings every week, and I remember 49 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 the meetings were -- there was a hotel, Algonquin Hotel in New York. We had to have the meetings, naturally. I went to the meeting, now everybody in mostly Mosul they had people who belonged to this that were veterans, who came back from -- American veterans, who didn\u2019t have what to do. They came back, some were Zionists, some were not Zionists, that they wanted to do something. Also, we had a -- a lot of black soldiers that they came, and tha -- this was a opportunity. So we ha -- and I were- and they establish a staff, and I was picked up, in the staff I was picked out -- I was made that I am the head of the military police, because my background in Poland, so lo -- and I was very happy, and we worked and wer -- and then it was -- he tried to get the permission from the American government, and they refused him. They said that you can go individually, but not as organization. A-A-Again, individually, 1t means illegal. But not as our -- he wanted to have a organization equipped, and money should come from America. So when I -- when this happened to them in this time, I also -- I started -- I belonged -- this was liquidated, so I belonged to the atsel, to the extreme revolutionaries, they\u2019re from Israel, so I belonged and then I wanted to go and they prepared. And my je -- I worked, but also my job was that we collected guns from veterans in America and we sent them over. Now, the guns had to be packed. So we had a place, by some Jew who he -- was a furrier on 27\" Street, and I went there after I worked, I went over ev-every night, and what we did, we -- we cleaned the guns, and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 50 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 we put them -- we packed them in barrels, and we closed it, and then there was camouflage [indecipherable] material, and -- and this had to go to Israel, to pal -- to Palestine in this time for the people from the atsel. And then one day we were packing this and the police came in. Somebody in -- squealed, I don\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know what, and they arrested us. They -- we were there about eight, nine people.

And I was 1n jail a herely -- I -- I just came from Europe and I was a stranger and I\u2019m already in jail. And I was there overnight, and the next day a group came, and the police, and started to interrogate us. And then after they ask me questions, they let us go. So they let us go, the reason why is because there were a lot of influential Jews in th -- with the police together. Well, now, legally I didn\u2019t have to look here, we pack [indecipherable] everything was illegal, but they let us go, they said to go out. So -- but I still went there, and they prepared us to go illegal, through Marseilles, to France to go to Israel. I even -- we had a cousin, she was a nurse in the 51 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 hospital, and I talked her in, and she said she will go with us. And then one day -- one day I came there and they said well, Sunday morning you transport is going, and -- and I came home, and I said to my wife, I am going, and she was against it. And I started -- I took what I could, a -- a knapsack, and I -- and she said to me, \u201cIf you are going you must know one thing. You are going but you cannot come back to me. I will not wait for you, and I don\u2019t care what, because I know you will go, you will be killed.

            "question": "Who were your friends in this?",
            "answer": "Well, th -- in the beginning, all my fre -- you see, my family, I had a large family, and my family was very, very not helpful. Like -- also, we came to America, you see - wh-when we wanted to go to Palestine in this time, and I wanted to go to America if we cannot go to Palestine, because I said that all the cousins are my age. Why? See, my father was the youngest from -- from the brothers, I was the youngest from us. And they had children and the children were my age. I said, I have cousins. This uncle has children, this uncle has children. So they were -- we will be close. They were very -- they never invited us. We were strange to them. And -- and 1n -- th-they were -- the children were rich, they didn\u2019t give me jobs. And we asked them for it. Now, the reason why is because they looked on us with the eyes as they will see their parents came when they came in 1885 - 1890. When they came in 18 ni -- in 1890, they came from a village. They never wore shoes in the village. They were not educated. They came over here when they were 14 -- eight -- 14 - 15 - 16 years, and they had to start 53 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 in -- in the -- in -- they never made out of -- of their life something. One was a presser, one was a tailor, one was a button hole maker. The children already were educated -- were [indecipherable]. So they looked at us, they didn\u2019t realize that we had a progress. America also had a progress. America in 1947 was not the same as in 1885. But they looked at us with the stories what their parents told us -- told them. So we were never their friends -- they were never -- which we expected to be liked. For instance, there is one woman, she still a -- she\u2019s 94 years now, and she was my first cousin, her name was Frances. And I was already six months here and I didn\u2019t see Frances and I knew the stories about Frances, because she was a older woman, she was already 32 years and she wasn\u2019t married. So my father, everything was on his mind. So he always, my father, when he had problems, when he thinks [indecipherable] so he used ta -- take his beard, and he used to chew his beard. So when he chews his beard, so we said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He said Frances. He got a letter Frances wasn\u2019t married, she\u2019s already 32 years. He always worried about Frances. So when Frances -- when I was [indecipherable] then later she got married, she had a daughter. I was six months, so once I called up Frances. I says, \u201cFrances, I\u2019m already here six months, and -- and my father always worried about you, and I wanted to see you.\u201d She was a daughter of my father\u2019s sister. So she said, \u201cOh yeah.\u201d This was a Sunday, and I had already -- I spent five cents for a telephone call. She 54 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 said, \u201cYeah, I would like to see you too, come over sometimes.\u201d So I says, \u201cFrances, why should I come over sometimes? Today is Sunday, I don\u2019t work, my wife doesn\u2019t work. Why can\u2019t we come over today?\u201d Because she lived in Brooklyn too. She said, \u201cOh, I already have some friends coming to my house.\u201d When she said to me this, I-I - | -- I didn\u2019t say anything, I hung up. Now, if she had friends, this was the best time to invite us, we should be -- and we should know fre -- so what, she was afraid to show off with the -- the greener animals, or those things, so this was their feeling. Now, my wife was more educated than they. Now, for instance, in the beginning they were very- they were angry at me why I -- I got married. So my wife was beautiful, she was very intelligent, she spoke seven languages, and everything -- they didn\u2019t -- so -- so they said -- even my brother said to me, \u201cWhy do you have to rush? You are a young fellow, you are not so bad looking, you could marry here a woman. All right, maybe she would be a -- a divorc\u00e9e, or a -- maybe she\u2019Il be a little older, but she will have two houses, she will have a business, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry, you wouldn\u2019t have to start for scratch, why do you have to marry?\u201d Now, I couldn\u2019t understand instead to be happy, that I brought over my wife, that she was prettier than they, she was more intelligent than they, she was smarter than they, she survived the war. So they said, why did you have to rush, why ya -- and I was 27 years. You see, th -- the -- there was no feeling, there was no understanding. There was only this one elderly -- the -- the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 55 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 one, the poor brother, Shulem we called him. He was the one nice guy. From the rest, there was no -- see, my wife\u2019s family was different. My wife\u2019s family took us in like -- like a family. Why? Because they knew them. My wife\u2019s family came in \u201938, so whe -- they lived in Berlin. So they knew them, they used to come and visit them [indecipherable] they knew them how they lived, they knew them how they went to school, they knew them they were different people.

I used to be president from my Kobulshovera [indecipherable] from the town. I am still Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 56 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 president from the Israeli Red Cross. I\u2019m president from here, I\u2019m president -- why? Because if I am involved, I have to be involved, otherwise I don\u2019t want to bother. My wife -- now, from all those groups that -- that I am involved with the organizations, we have friends, but we are, I don\u2019t know, so close as with the people who are survivors. For instance, last year I had a very big -- things happened. I bi -- the B\u2019nai Brith -- you know what B\u2019nai Brith -- and I used to be very active, and I am still -- and we have a -- a board from the local B\u2019nai Brith, and -- and once a month we have a meeting, and -- and then once we always make a, once a year, on one of the meetings we have a film. And we show the film and the people come and the m -- the membership, not only the board. So when th-the president said, let\u2019s have a film, I saw a film from Woody Allen. And Woody Allen, a wonderful comedy, let\u2019s have a film from him. I -- I don\u2019t like Woody Allen as a human being, I don\u2019t like him as a Jew, I don\u2019t like him at all, because he\u2019s too -- he\u2019s -- so I said why should we have Woody Allen\u2019s film? It so happens that I got a new film, it\u2019s called, \u201cThe Rescuers,\u201d maybe you saw it. And \u201cThe Rescuers\u201d is a wonderful film, it is -- the first is a Polish girl, a Polish woman who was -- took a -- a Jewish boy for two years. The father of the Jewish boy was a doctor, the mother was lawyer, but anyway, they became -- she was a nanny for the boy, and they were taken away and they were killed, and they gave the boy to the -- this woman.

And it Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 57 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 shows the whole film how she save it, her problems she had.

She\u2019s Catholic, but she wanted to be with the boy, and the boy is happy, he studied. Beautiful story.

Six million Jews were killed. 58 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 It was just yesterday, I\u2019m still alive. A million and a half children. And -- and you should say it on a Jewish -- in a Jewish organization, B\u2019nai Brith?\u201d And I -- and -- and, so he said, \u201cWell we suffered too.\u201d I says, \u201cWhen did you suffer?\u201d She -- you -- you didn\u2019t have enough steak, you had to eat chicken?\u201d Because they would not have - and I walked out and I said, \u201cI am not coming here any more.\u201d Now, it didn\u2019t -- not so much that this idiot said stop with this crap, with the always -- there were 18 people, and nobody said a word. None of them opened their mouth. And after this I wrote a letter to the international president, he never answered me, and to the people I didn\u2019t go back. So I -- and those were mostly American who -- I said, you have here your family, your fathers, your mothers, your children are here, your grandchildren are here. Those people didn\u2019t suffer. And [indecipherable] for him, it is enough. We talked about the Holocaust enough. So -- so you ask about friends. I feel comfortable when I am between somebody -- now, I was very active -- now I\u2019m not so active. We have the Vagra, the Warsaw uprise organization. Every year -- every year we make a commemoration in the -- used to be Madison Square Garden. And I was the chairman from the arrangement and security.

He was very happy to talk to me, and I was happy to talk to me, because we went through different 59 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 ways, but we always went through the same.

So the Polish people killed all the Jews from their town where they lived together three, four hundred years. And they burned -- they pushed them in, and then he described the owner of the barn, and the owner of the barn said he didn\u2019t want to do it, that they forced him. Some were later arrested. They pushed them in, they poured gasoline and they burned all alike. Now if you -- in -- in the -- in the book is so -- now, wh-wh-what he describes, that before they pushed in, there was a child. The Poles were standing with knives and they 64 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 took out the eyes from the children, and they threw in the children. Now, they knew that they will be killed. Why did they have to do it in the -- it\u2019s such bestiality, such terrible thing. Now, the book just came out, so I told him the book has -- I want to translate it. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s being now translated into English, and into Hebrew.\u201d So it will come out maybe 1n a month or two months. But the English version came out last month."

                " I wanted to have -- when we got -- when we got together in Poland, we didn\u2019t want to have children. Course we beli -- we spoke about it, and we decided we don\u2019t want to bring in children to such a world because we wouldn\u2019t know what happened in -- and like my sisters, all the children, they were killed, so why should we bring in children into world? And then in -- so we didn\u2019t want. Then later when we came to America, so we figured we are now in America, it\u2019s a different country and everything, we want to have children. So it took us 11 years, we -- we didn\u2019t have a child. After 11 years we ha -- we wanted to adopt, but I didn\u2019t want to adopt on the black market. So we went to a doctor, and the doctor to see if there\u2019s something wrong with me, or with my wife, and the doctors, well they said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you two. So we don\u2019t have the children. So we want to ad -- adopt not with black markets and we went to a legitimate Steven Bryce adoption. And we want to adopt, we made the application, it 65 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 took about a year, and they gave a case wer -- a worker, and she was very nice, and -- and she told us that they will approve it. And one day, which was before Thanksgiving, she come to our house, and this time we lived in Brooklyn, she saw the apartment, and we showed her we have one room reserved, and we going to put it for a- for a child. And she and I made already in this time a good living. My wife was a teacher, and I had a good business already. I still was a peddler. And she said, \u201cI think you will have a very good Thanksgiving,\u201d because they were ready to give us a child. And we says, \u201cWell, we prefer if we can get a girl.\u201d We wanted to have a girl. And then, befo -- before about two months and before she said that probably we\u2019 ll have it, sh -- they switched her and we got the other worker. And the first minute when she came to house, we saw right away that she\u2019s not the same person. She looked at my wife and she was -- we saw that she is very jealous. And the way she talked to my wife, and my wife was maybe prettier, we had a nice apartment. And -- and she was not so nice as the other one to us. And then later we got a letter that we were rejected. It was a very terrible shock to us. And the reason why we\u2019re rejected is because they don\u2019t -- they -- they don\u2019t believe that we, after going through so much, that we are normal people, that we will be able to bring up a child like in a normal home. And this was the terrible thing. I had people who wrote letters, people who I helped very much - like, for instance, there was a Dr. Rosenhow, he was one of the biggest professors in 66 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 the world, and I did a lot of things for him. He was in this time a professor in Columbia, he was a very -- a international known eye doctor. So I told him this, so he wrote a letter, and some other [indecipherable] what I did to him -- for him. And -- and there was other men, but then they said once it\u2019s rejected, nobody can correct it. But nothing wrong with us, the only thing that they don\u2019t think that we will be able to bring up a child. If -- well, anyway. So then I said I have no -- I have no choice, so we find somebody that we can get a child on the black market, and we got in touch with a woman from Philadelphia, and in this time she said for 8,000 dollars we can get a child. And so we agreed, and I gave no money in advance. She said the minute when they was here -- we told her we want to have a newborn child, and if -- a -- a girl, and if she will have it, I will come and pick it up and gi-give her the money.

Not a value of Judaism, about religion, God, but to be proud being a Jew, what the Jews did. This what I am proud, what the Jews did, fa -- through the 4,000 years since Abraham, what they did to human beings, what they did to the world, including the 10 commandments, including Jesus, even. That -- how come that- that -- even with the Catholics, when they believe, said God picked out Mary to have a child, that God is a father, how come she didn\u2019t go to a -- to a Spanish woman, or to a Polish woman, or to a Irish woman and have a child -- if -- 1f I would believe what a Catholic believes. And to have a child with -- with -- with one of those nationality. So why did He pick out a Jewish girl, to have a child with a Jewish girl? So probably there is something more to it. Now -- which I don\u2019t believe in all those things. Now, I believe in Jesus, far as a human being. Now, he was -- if Jesus wouldn\u2019t be made now, the religion was made 200 years later they started to write. If Jesus wouldn\u2019t be made a God, he would be a prophet by the Jews, because he was a -a--a--aman that he tried to help the underdog. His friends were fishermen, shepherds, prostitutes, all those things because he wanted to help them. He was a very ethical man. And so I believe in this, but I don\u2019t believe that Jesus had anything to do 69 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 with God. I mean, he was a religious man. Jesus was a Nazere, a naze -- I don\u2019t know if you know what means a Nazere. A Nazere means that he didn\u2019t want to have too much pleasure from a life on this world.

So to me that the Jews -- this what I try to -- what the Jews gave to -- to the world, now take in -- in our time, the biggest doctors, the biggest thinkers, the biggest musicians, everything is Jewish, I am very proud of it. \u2019'm very proud of our heritage during all the time of the religion and their history. But I stop a little when it comes to God, I stop because I have questions, and I don\u2019t know if I believe in God, if I don\u2019t believe in God. I don\u2019t want to think about it, but if I believe, I\u2019m very angry at Him. Because if -- like they say, if He rolled -- runs the world, and if He rules everything, how -- where was He when they pushed in 4,000 people in a cha -- in a gas chamber in Auschwitz, and the -- the crying and everything, He didn\u2019t hear it. If He didn\u2019t hear it, and He didn\u2019t help, so probably He couldn\u2019t help. And if He couldn\u2019t help, well who -- who needs Him? So the -- but I -- but this isn\u2019t -- but Esther is more religious that we are, because she doesn\u2019t have this experience. She doesn\u2019t ask God why didn\u2019t He do this, why didn\u2019t He this, why didn\u2019t He help my mother.

And so not being a Cohen 1s cut off by me, because a daughter is not -- she herself is a Cohen, a daughter of a Cohen, but her children are not any more. So this I am a little disappointed, because I would like this lineage should be long, and it should be til the end of time. But it isn\u2019t, but Iam happy. And they are -- they are the three boys, and -- and they should know that they are very proud to be Jews. And if -- if -- if one of them would marry out of religion, this will be the worst thing for me, I don\u2019t know if I could survive it. Not because era -- oh -- I bel- I told you this before, not because about not being religious, but not being a Jew, because there was a man, there was a nation, they want a -- nea -- hel -- a -- destroy all the Jews, and I said no, I want to be alive. And through me -- not only me, and others, said we are going around, we going a -- we are here, we establish a country, we in -- in America. We are Jews, and we did so much for -- for the world, that I want the continuation should be."

            "answer": "Well, this 1s a achievement about having a family. So now, also achievement is that I will leave a few books. And this is very important for me because -- see, I don\u2019t make money on the books, and I\u2019m not interested to make money. And if -- if -- if I get from wha -- book, I get some royalties or something, I send it to the mu -- to the 80 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 museum right away, because I don\u2019t need it, I may -- I have enough. But to leave a heritage -- now, if I will leave my daughter, a other -- other thousand dollars, or a other five thousand dollars, and I will leave her a book, I much more in -- in -- I -- I\u2019m much more happier. Why? Because the grandchildren will know, well my grandfather wrote a book, and what do I write, I don\u2019t write jokes, I don\u2019t write -- I write something from the -- our survival. Like -- like if I would have the book from my grandfather who wrote about Jesus, even -- [ -- I -- I cannot imagine how he could have courage to write a book like this. But still he wrote it, he had -- he -- he went out and he -- he had guts to do it. So this is also that -- that my -- my s -- my -- what I did with the books is very important. And also that I am [indecipherable] my wife, and -- and my wife is -- I think we are -- we ra -- we are in love, e -- even we have frictions [indecipherable] and -- and the frictions are because she doesn\u2019t tie down the toothpaste like I want it should be down because it\u2019s loose. So we -- we have those kind of arguments. Not because it\u2019s important things, but small thing [indecipherable] like -- like she likes, in winter for instance, I have a busy day because the whole day she opens the window and I close the window. She wants a [indecipherable] minute I come in, I go out, the window\u2019s open. I close it. So those are -- those are the -- the -- the frictions. But as a whole, I think we agree on everything. We agree with the -- with the -- with the grandchildren. We agree with our daughter, with -- mostly only small things that 81 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 otherwise -- and -- and this -- this 1s a achievement, the achievement is that I am alive, that our generation, our heritage is alive, and I am giving -- I prepare a lot of things, the only worry I have is that they will not continue, or they will destroy it. Now, for instance, I told you before about the stamps. I collected the stamps over 50 years, and I have the most beautiful collection. I don\u2019t want to sell it, I don\u2019t want to give it to a museum. I want my grandchildren should have it, because it is -- the stamps gave me a lot of pleasure. I collected it, and it\u2019s worth a lot of money if I sell 1t, and now I get nothing, practically for it. As a matter of fact, I told you before, I bought today two albums. I said million times I wouldn\u2019t buy any more, but it comes out something, I buy it. So this is a -- this 1s a very -- a very -- a pleasant thing, and -- and I -- I belong to a lot of organizations. Now I started to give up because a lot of times in the evening there are meetings in New York, and -- and I don\u2019t go. Even if I want to go, my wife doesn\u2019t let me go. So this is very rewarding, that I am getting acknowledged, I\u2019m getting plaques, I\u2019m invited to speak. And life goes on. This what is inside me, nobody knows, because every night -- there 1s not a night that I shouldn\u2019t thi -- see, I am -- I am the United States almost 50 years. 50, or more? \u201947? More than 50, yeah. I never dreamt about the United States. Now, I went through, I have my life here and family. You always dream from your life. I never had that dream about the United States. It doesn\u2019t mean that United States was bad for me, in the contrary. United States was 82 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 very good for me. Always when I have a dream, it\u2019s always a dream from home, before the war. Dream from the Holocaust, and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and I never -- I never -- and I\u2019m thinking about life here. I never dreamt about it. Maybe this is the way it should be, that you don\u2019t dream from -- from good things where you are alive here, but you dream from before. So th-th-the -- I live with the past, and this is very -- it\u2019s not good, but I live with the past in, all right, luckily my wife is also a survivor. Would I have an American survivor, probably we couldn\u2019t live together -- I mean, with American person, because I don\u2019t think so that somebody would take it. But with her, she has the same problem as I, when she dreams, she dreams also about her family, about her ho -- about her youth. And -- and this how we going on. I -- I -- I am very much interested like I told you in the Temple, I\u2019m not religious, but when it comes to the high holidays, I perform, and I -- I conduct services, I\u2019m singing with the choir, I teach them. Because this is something that it\u2019s in me, it\u2019s a heritage, and I don\u2019t want to let it go."

The world has learned that our environment -- when -- when people who are involved learn a -- Jews learned a lot, not so much about the Holocaust. Let\u2019s say -- let\u2019s talk about Jews in America. The Jews in America are a little different now to what\u2019s Israel. They are closer to the Israel -- to Israel on account of the Holocaust, because they know that we -- would we have Israel before the war, probably more than half of Jews will be alive, because they will run out and they will have a place where to go. They didn\u2019t know where to go. So now, this is like a insurance policy. A lot of Jews -- well, the young Jews I don\u2019t think so, because they think we are in America, America is mine. We have America in our pocket. And it\u2019s not true. So -- but the other people, the elderly people, they figure well, this a insurance policy that in case something happens we have where to go. So the whole world didn\u2019t learn anything, because as you can see, we have now not on the -- on the So -- so strong as the Holocaust, we had Rwanda, we had Bosnia, we had Cambodia. So there are a lot of places that 1t was repeated. It was not so repeated like the Holocaust, like I said to you before. Why? Because it\u2019s not done by the Germans. 91 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 Would the Germans be in those places, it will be done completely. But those people were not capable to make it so complete as the Germans, because everything what the Germans did, it had to be perfect. So they did perfect with the Holocaust also. So -- but they didn\u2019t learn in case something happened it will be the same thing. Now, America for instance, there are so many nationalities, but we know the time for McCarthy, I don\u2019t know if you remember this, it was almost. But, there were courageous people who stood up, and they started to bring this in the -- t-to the world and they -- and he was thrown out. But as -- y-y -- also because it was good times.

And the next scapegoat will be a Jew. There is even a story that a Jew -- somebody said to a Jew that all -- all the disasters are on account of the Jews. Everything, all troubles are the Jews. So -- so then he said, well give me one example. So he said, take the Titanic. The Titanic si -- under the Jews. So he said what you bring the Jews, what have to do ya-ya? He said, well the -- the -- the Titanic was destroyed by a iceberg. So he said, this what I mean, iceberg, Greenberg, Goldberg, they are all the same. So this 1s -- this is -- the man said it and he believed it. And there is -- and then a other man said about the -- about the Holocaust that all the trouble in the world, all the trouble in the world are on account of the Jews, and account of Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 92 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 bicycle riders. Every trouble what\u2019s on the world are -- is guilty the Jew, or the bicycle riders. And people, when you tell it to them, they look at you and they ask, why bicycle riders? What have bicycle riders to do with the destructions with this? Nobody\u2019d ask why the Jews. Nobody said what do have the Jew -- in the country, if there is a disaster, the first scapegoat is the Jew. So nobody -- when you tell the story, and I tell the story to a lot of people, nobody ask yet, why the Jew. But everybody ask, why the bicycle rider? So there you have the answer, and if you ask -- if it co -- 1f the world learned a lesson, the world didn\u2019t learn no lesson. The Jews learned a lesson. The Jews who survived learned a lesson. I don\u2019t think that the Jews in America learned a lesson. There are some Jews who th -- know there was a Holocaust. But the majority Jew, what, they go to W-Wall Street, making money, coming home, going -- going to -- to a nightclub, going to the movie. Do they think about the Holocaust? No. The Holocaust was done for somebody else, and it was done in a other\u2019s time, and it is not for them."

So what will he say? He said let me count it over. And he will count over, he said, he\u2019s right. He will give him extra 35 dollars. Now here, if it was wrong, if -- 1f 1t was right -- so why do they have to be 94 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 afraid it will be counted over? If it\u2019s right, so he\u2019s right. But they didn\u2019t count it over because they knew it was wrong. So this I am very much hurt. Forget about the democrats or republicans. If it will be the opposite, I will be hurt the same way. So a thing like this, I am very, very much disappointed. Disappointed because I love America, I love American democrats e-even if it\u2019s not hundred percent, but at least we can speak about it.

The Supreme Court has -- 1-1s not created to make a decision about elections. The Supreme Court is made for -- to make decisions about something else. You see, be-because you ask me, those are the things that just happened yesterday. So a thing like this, I am disappointed because I feel America is mine. It\u2019s not a thing that I am living in a strange country, is a -- ina foreign country like I lived in Poland. In Poland everything they did, I had to take it for granted, this is the way it should be. But not in America, this is my America. The same thing it\u2019s your America. Who are the Americans? We -- and this is -- and then there are -- there are a lot of places, a lot of where I c -- I could give you a lot of instances that it is the same way I -- when I see injustice and it\u2019s done in America, I feel very bad, because I feel 1t is mine, and there shouldn\u2019t any injustice. ... Mostly songs that I sing -- course, 1t\u2019s a very popular song, because this is from my operetta, it\u2019s made by Goldfarden. And the operetta\u2019s name is Shilamis. Shilamis is -- was a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 95 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 story about the ancient Israel. And it\u2019s a -- and there is a song is [speaks Hebrew here] means almonds in raisins. And you -- this is a lullaby. And my daughter knew about it because I always sing it, she didn\u2019t know what the words are. And -- and this they -- this they -- the song is about the Temple, and they described about the Temple, and they -- I always lo -- I love older -- ol-older songs, but this 1s special with my daughter.

This is always -- I sing this when -- when I just was in a place and I sing Yiddish songs and there was one woman, and she said, \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m listening, but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d So I said, \u201cFor you, I have a beautiful Jewish song, but it\u2019s in English.\u201d So she was so glad, so I said this 1s, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Sabbath Candles,\u201d did you ever hear it? It\u2019s a beautiful song, I like it. Okay? [sings] \u201cMy mother\u2019s Sabbath candles that make our home so bright, that faithfully she light them with a prayer each Friday night. And then around the table, we gathered and we heard my father chant a Kiddush, his heart is everywhere. Our humble home became a mansion in that mystic low. Our hearts filled again with hopes and dreams of long ago. Through all the tragic stories of Israel\u2019s darkest nights, they never dimmed the glory of my mother\u2019s Sabbath lights.\u201d My mother\u2019s Sabbath lights, I\u2019m sure that all of you Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 96 Interview with Norman Salsitz February 9, 2001 remember your mother\u2019s Sabbath lights, and if she was anything like my mother, she used to do this. First you put in a babushka, a fichila, or a kerchief over her head and light the minimum of two candles. And if your mother was as religious as mine, she also lit a candle, an extra candle for each child in the house. And even an extra candle on top, just for good luck. With her hands, she covered her face, and made a traditional pray -- prayer, because this was the closest she ever got to God. \u201cAnd then around the table, we got it and we heard my father chant the Kiddush, his heart is everywhere.\u201d [sings in foreign language here]. \u201cOur humble home became a mansion in the te -- mystic glow. Our hearts were filled again with hopes and dreams of long ago. Through all the tragic stories of Israel\u2019s darkest nights, they never dimmed the glory of my mother\u2019s Sabbath lights.
