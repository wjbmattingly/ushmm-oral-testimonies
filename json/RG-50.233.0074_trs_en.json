And my brother gave me advice and told me, why don\u2019t you look in the phone book and write to some people and they will sponsor us because no country would let you in anymore. We could leave Vienna if anybody would let you in but no country wanted to leave the refugees in. So we took a English phone book and I wrote five names from the alphabet. The first five names. I wrote to Abbot was his name Abbot and four more names and my sister wrote to a few B\u2019s and her name was Bell. And a few weeks later, I got an answer from a man named Abbot and my sister from the name Benn and he said he would sponsor us and be able to help a human life. And he wrote all the documents and this is the way I came to England. And he was a complete stranger. It was in 1939. And when I came to England, he was a furrier and right in the heart of Oldgate he was situated. And I went to thank him and we were not allowed to take any money, of course, only 30 shillings we were allowed to take from Vienna and we were not supposed to in England because he guaranteed for us but he asked me and asked of course, because no money or nothing, and asked, can you keep a needle in your hand. And are you good at sewing and I say of course. So he gave me a job off the books. He paid me in cash and I was sewing and I was happy and I had a job there in his factory. I was sewing lining in fur coats and he was very nice. He save my life. And my sister. She was married at that time."
