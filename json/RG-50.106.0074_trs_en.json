We hear about it, but we, ourselves, haven\u2019t gotten it \u2014 I can\u2019t think of the word I want to use, but haven\u2019t come across it, and hopefully we won\u2019t and my grandchildren won\u2019t either."

It was a temporary, it was a stop off and it ended up being 11 years over there, and we really couldn\u2019t wait for the day to live, hopefully that 1t would of been a better life in United States, because we didn\u2019t know what to expect."
