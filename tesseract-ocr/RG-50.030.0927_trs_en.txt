Q: Okay.
A: And they had three stores. And one of my mother’s brothers took care of one,
and I guess they took care of the other two. And, interestingly enough, my father
was a very assimilated German Jew. He was not taken to a concentration camp.
Like, the only person that I know. And, in a way, I think if he had been, my mother
would have gotten him out.
Q: We’ll come to that part of your story —
A: Oh, okay.
Q: — later. Right now, what I’m trying to get a sense of is what was life like in pre-
war Germany, in your childhood. Who are the people — I'll — Pll — ll ask these
questions —
A: Sure.
Q: — in turn. But the purpose is to paint a picture with words, of what was the
environment in which you grew up. So, since we’re talking about —
A: Right.
Q: — pharmacies, tell me, did both of your parents go to high — higher education?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay. Which places? You don’t know.
A: I don’t know.

April 27, 2017
Q: That’s okay.
A: I think my — my father came — I’m — I’m pretty sure it was an arranged marriage,
and I think my father was the pharmacist, and when they married, my mother got
her training.
Q: Are both of your parents from Hamelin originally?
A: No.
Q: Where were they from?
A: My mother came from a place called Fulda.
Q: I’ve been there, yes, Fulda, mm-hm.
A: And came from a very large family. And my father had two brothers, and came
from a much more elevated background. And he li — when I visited his mother, it
was 1n Breslau, b-e-r-s-l-a-u.
Q: So that would be in e-eastern part of Germany, near Poland. And Breslau, I
believed —
A: I—I don’t know.
Q: Okay. What were your parents’ names, first names?
A: Leo was my father’s name.
Q: Okay.
A: And my mother was Rosetta.

Q: And her maiden name?
A: Lump. L-u-m-p.
Q: Lump. When you say that they came from different social strata, what do you —
what do you mean specifically, in the sense of what — what did her parents do to
support their family, what did his parents do?
A: I don’t know what my father’s parents did, but as a kid, I mean, I was 11 when I
left, so I just have vague memories. They, to me, seemed to live quite elegantly.
Q: Also in Berlin?
A: I think it was Breslau where we visited.
Q: Okay.
A: And my grandfather was a cow dealer.
Q: A lot of people dealt in cattle.
A: And — in Fulda. And to me, he was very forbidding. I mean, he was very Jewish,
he had a long beard. He — he was — I think I was always a little afraid of him. His
wife was a wonderful woman, my grandmother. She had cancer, she lived — they
lived very modestly. But I remember — and I used to visit a lot, because I think my
parents were always working. And she sort of lived in her bed in their living room.
But she was very wise, and I remember really loving her.

Q: Okay.
A: — I just was aware of her being —
Q: Okay.
A: — very brave, and old and you know, kind of wonderful.
Q: Okay.
A: But my mother came from 11 children.
Q: That’s a lot.
A: That’s a lot.
Q: That’s a lot.
A: So when I used to visit in Fulda, there were a lot of siblings, and I always
remember having good times there. We did very simple things, like pick
blueberries, you know, but I— I —I loved visiting, and I’m told that we visit — I have
a sister — that we visited a lot, because my parents were working a lot.
Q: Well, when you have a store, you know, it — it’s almost like a f—1t’s more than a
full-time job. You can’t leave the store.
A: And they both — and they both worked.

something? No.
A: Sorry, I don’t know.
Q: That’s okay. I ask these, but it’s okay if you don’t know. It’s perfectly fine. I’m
trying to get a sense of what was the background, what were the roots, you know,
and sometimes —
A: Right.
Q: — people know about these things, and sometimes they don’t.
A: I don’t have any memory of the family, my grandfather and grandmother really
being together. I don’t think I ever saw them together. I remember her being in the
bed, and my aunts and uncles —

A: My father had two brothers.
Q: Okay.

wore spats and a cane, and he looked like, you know, he stepped out of — one of
those original —
Q: Yeah.
A: — elegant Germans. And — and the other, I think maybe was a pharmacist, too.
And his name was Edward.
Q: Edward.
A: And he went to Shanghai.
Q: As well?
A: As well. And he discouraged, from the little I remember, cause I was only 11
when I left, he — and I do remember vaguely, this conversation, saying to my
parents, don’t come to Shanghai, people are dying in the streets here. And that was
the only place that was open to Jews at that point. So my Aunt Berta(ph), that was

so good to us, she and her husband went to Shanghai, came here, and brought me

Q: Yeah, father’s side.
A: Mother’s side.
Q: That’s right, Berta(ph) is, but the uncle who went to Shanghai was from —
A: Was from my father’s side.
Q: Did they have contact with each other, these two sides of the family?
A: Y —I’m not so sure, but I can tell you, the one that — you know, the fancy one.
Q: The one with the spats.
A: The one with the spats. I just remembered his spats. And — was one of the first
people to go to Israel, and hated it.

A: And — and he came back, and his — he had one wife, and one son, and they were
killed. And he was in England, and we visited him. And from this elegant man, he
was totally broken.
Q: Oh.
A: I mean, it was really — he was broken, 1s all I can say. Now, the other one,
interestingly enough, who went to Shanghai, came from Shanghai, worked for my
Uncle Hans(ph), was Berta’s(ph) husband’s name. He was incredible. He took — he
used to meet the boats, and take anyone who came, to work for him. And he — is it
sidetracking to go to that story.
Q: A little bit, a little bit.
A: Do you want to come to that later?
Q: Yeah, I would —
A: Okay.
Q: Thank you, thank you —
A: Cause that’s an interesting story. Anyhow, the bottom line is, he came to
America, worked for my uncle, was offered, you know, restitution or whatever. He
and his wife went back to Germany. My sister and I could not understand how he
could possibly do that. But he was offered, you know, whatever reparation, or he

a little money. His two nieces, because they didn’t have any children.
Q: This is your father’s brother?
A: Second brother.
Q: And when you say Breslau, to me that sounds like it was in what became East
Germany.
A: I think it —
Q: I —I think it is, because it has a Polish version as well, of the name.
A: I think so. I think so. Did it then come under Germany?’
Q: Well, I’m a little bit va — foggy on —
A: Iam too.
Q: — the geography, but I do know that these cities changed —
A: They did.
Q: You know, they — the borders changed.
A: Exactly.

sometimes they were Poland.

And there were two portraits in the living room, one of my sister and one of me.

plumbing?

people?
A: You know, I don’t think there were too many Jewish people in our
neighborhood.
Q: Okay.

that thought Hitler, from my memory, and I think it’s accurate, he thought Hitler
was a temporary madman.
Q: Many people did. Many people did.
A: And, you know, he had a comfortable life. And when I think about it — there was
a 10 year difference. And when I think about it now, to pick up and go totally to an
unknown place must have been almost impossible.
Q: For many people, it was terrifying. They couldn’t —
A: My mother would have done it.
Q: Did your father ever tell you about his World War I experiences?
A: He was in the German army, and I think he was very proud to be there.
Q: Did he tell you about his experiences in it?
A: No.
Q: No. When — when I asked about religious affiliation, did that mean that you and
your sister also, you know, practiced? That you — did you go to synagogue, did you
keep kosher at home?
A: No. It was more me. My sist — at one point, because of the influence of the rabbi
who brought us to England, I was really quite religious. But my sister wasn’t.

cold home? How would you describe it?

parents had an arranged marriage.

were going through several efforts to try to get us out.

classes together in preparation for leaving.

happy to hear that my parents and brother were already in America, and that I was
on my way as well. Of her 10 brothers and sisters, Rosie was the only one who had
not been able to emigrate. Her husband Leo, a trained pharmacist, was now working
in a chemical factory that was making war materials. I understand that, as such, he
would never get a permit to leave. He was now a member of the war essential work
force, assigned to work far beneath his qualifications, at wages set arbitrar —
arbitrarily by the Nazis. Since the war had started in September 1939, Rosie had
heard only sporadically about their two girls, Doris and Hannah(ph), since they
had left for England. Direct communication between England and Germany was
no longer possible, and it will come directly through friends or relatives in neutral
places, like America, or Shanghai, or some South American countries. I had met
Doris about five years earlier, when she was visiting her Aunt Berta(ph) in Celle,
and I was happy that she and Hannah(ph) were safely in England. I was also glad

wasn’t as traumatic, it wasn’t like we were the only ones who were separated from
our parents. It was, they put the school on a train, they sent you to these remote
places, where mostly really poor people had volunteered to take the children, and
they got some money. So, you get off the train. They walk you down — down the
street, knock on the door, here are two kids, here are two kids. And we — we were
all — the English kids were in exactly the same position.
Q: So it’s a shared experience in some ways.

the same position. And then — so — and then we still had hope that, you know, my
parents, we were going to get together.
Q: Yes. That’s early on?
A: It was early on, and there was hope that they — we would meet, and all come to
America together. I think that kind of saved the total shock. The other thing that
happened is — course, we didn’t speak the language. So, there were a few German
kids, and they sent us to whatever the local school was. I practically had no

handed a flag. That people — that sometimes they would talk to you.

A: I think so. Cause there wasn’t much — you know, wherever we lived in England,
they were all non-Jewish, I mean, all the families were not Jewish. I think the only
Jewish family is the girl that I lived with in the end. I’m sure they were Jewish.
Q: Okay, okay, yeah. But when you get to New York, that changes. When you are

A: My aunt was definitely — spiritually, she — wouldn’t you say Berta(ph) was a

Q: Tell me about her personality.

a whole — there’s a whole story —
Q: Okay, tell us.
A: —1in—I—Thave those papers somewhere. And she — she was tiny, but she kept
the entire large family together. And she was never going to go to Germany, hated
everything German. But then she got this offer to go to Fulda, where they were
recreating the Hebrew school that they went to. There weren’t any Jews left, but —
but Fulda, and the mayor, and you know, they’re part of the restitution. And a
whole lot of us went. I —

Q: I know. But do you remember what decade it was? Was this the 70s, or the 80s?
A: We just went through that.
Q: I think we did, but I’d like to ground this chronologically. Was this where you
said your daughter was three years old, and now she’s —
A2: It was 1987.
Q: 1987. Okay. So 19 eight —
A: And that was actually very meaningful for everybody.
A2: It was — we went back in May of 1987.
Q: And did you — was this the first time you were back in Germany’
A: Yes.
Q: Okay. Okay. So tell me about that trip.
A: Well, first of all, it was really interesting, because my aunt, who said she’d never
go, since I was free, and — her family was going. There were a whole lot of us. A lot
of her sisters and brothers of my family. We — we were a whole group. And it — it
was very meaningful to the family as a group, because you know, Steven came, my
cousins from — Berta’s(ph) own children came. Other children from these 11
offspring came. And — and it was very well organized. I mean, we met in the
schloss, which wasn’t hurt at all. Fulda is very historic, so —

Q: Yes.
A: — it was interesting.
Q: Yes, it’s a pretty city.
A: Because, you know, it wasn’t really demolished, I mean, so it had a lot of the
original history. And so many people came from Israel, from all over the place.
And then there’s just a small, funny aside, and a lot of religious people cou — course
it was — the mayor, and another person who’d come from Israel, I mean, they —
they worked it out. And the people who went to this school were paid for, but all the
relatives who came, we all paid for ourselves.
Q: Okay.
A: So it turned out to be a much bigger group than they were expecting. Lufthansa
ca-catered the kosher food. That to me was such an irony, because they were
unprepared for, you know, the many people that would show up.
Q: Wow.
A: And I think for Steven —

A: For me it was meaningful because I had refused to speak German. In fact, I
didn’t — I never talked it. So when we got the first day — I had a ca — bad — my aunt
had a daughter who was very interested in keeping in touch with whatever groups
there were. Unfortunately, she’s not alive any more. But she had written to Judith
Miller.
Q: An author of a book called, “One by One by One.”
A: Right. Who happened to be in Germany covering the Nuremberg trials, or
something. And she showed up the next day, came up to me, and said, can you tell
me who Nancy Kamp(ph) is, my cousin is, and I said yes, she’s over there. So
Judith Miller talked to Nancy. Really liked Steven because he was young, and not
an old refugee, and cottoned onto him. I think he — he — you were at Harvard at the
time, right?
A2: Yeah.
A: So — you know, so she held onto me, and to Steven.
Q: Okay.
A: And they started the speeches. So Steven is saying, what are they saying, and
Judith is saying, what are they saying. My German came back. And suddenly — I
couldn’t read it in the paper the next day, but I was able to translate.

A: So I was able to translate, but I hadn’t talked — I hadn’t talked it. And when I
went to — the paper was full of it, I mean, we had reams this thick. I couldn’t read
the German, but I definitely was able to translate.
Q: It’s interesting too, that when you went to live with your relatives once you
arrived in Brooklyn, that that means you didn’t speak German with each other at
home. You must have spoken English.
A: We did.

A2: Thirty years ago. I remember — I remember it pretty vividly. There was a large
group, and the town, and the press really beyond the town, in Germany, | guess this
was a time when there was a lot of interest in Germany about Jews coming back to
visit. And I remember getting off the plane when we first arrived in Germany, and

departing off the plane with my mother and the whole group. And there were news
cameras recording us getting off the plane, and it was a little jarring, and —
Q: You didn’t expect that.
A2: Not at all. And then — and then the next day we looked, and you know, the — the
local TV station, and I think even beyond the local TV station had, you know, news
reports about the Jews of Fulda coming back. And I must say, it was quite
arresting, because I-I have never really f-felt so much like, you know, the Jews
coming back, it was just weird to be —
Q: In a group like that?
A2:—1in a group like that, and I guess the — Fulda had had a large Jewish
population before and during the war, that there were —
A: Very Orthodox.
A2: I think when we came back, there were 60,000 people in the town of Fulda,
and maybe 30 Jews.
Q: Who st — who were local there, and lived there.
A2: Yes, in other words, the population had gone from 1200 to 30.

Jews who — who stayed and lived in Fulda?

A2: I don’t remember doing that.
A: I don’t think there were any.
A2: Yeah, I don’t — I don’t think there were —
Q: Okay. Any of the 12, for example.
A2: I—I-— my belief is that there were no Jews that survived in Fulda, that some
had come back —
Q: Okay.
A2: — between the end of the war and 1987. But 30, that’s not a huge number.
Q: No, 30 is not a lot.
A2: And the town made a big effort, and the mayor of the town, who I think later
had a more prominent political, you know, career in ger — in modern Germany, had
— one of his initiatives was to try and rebuild a temple in Fulda, as a way of
emphasizing, you know, a new — a new post-Nazi view, and — and I think he was
the one behind organizing —

my mother and her family and our family, but you couldn’t miss the fact that it had
this political significance. The way it was covered by the press. Frankly, the
security. It was a little eerie, because everywhere we went, it was fairly subtle, but
there was —
Q: Coverage.
A2: Well, there was coverage, but we had armed military, not just local police, but
Q: To protect you?
A2: T — yes. Because there was the belief — I think Germany felt that there was all

A2: Well, in midde — there — you know —
Q: Mideast terrorism.
A2: Exactly. So, and I think Germany felt, and the mayor felt that, to invite the
Jews back to Fulda, make a big statement about reconciliation, and have a terrorist
incident, would not be a good thing. But the — but the level of security, maybe it
wasn’t necessary, and — but it was — it added a level of —
A: Drama, I think.

German. I didn’t think she spoke German. And the second —

very deeply. The way you suddenly started speaking German, you know, everyone

was describing a — a very bad incident, in which —

who was like overhearing and listening. But it just struck me that Bertha(ph) was
telling her story, and this woman was — I don’t — I couldn’t read her mind, but it
seemed like some combination of just being horribly upset — but not necessarily

remember someone went to the back and said, oh look, the barn’s still there, or
something like that. And then the shutters open a little bit, and someone looks out
from the second floor, and then the shutters close again. And then that happened
like two or three times. And I think we rang on the doorbell. No one answered. And
then we rang the doorbell a-again, and a woman opened the door, and she was — it —
the whole dynamic really suggested that the person there just really didn’t want
these visitors and would — would like them to go away, and —

A2: So [remember going to that room, that living room. And I remember you kind
of reacting very greatly to like, this 1s exact — it doesn’t look anything like — all the
furniture is different, it doesn’t look anything, but this exactly —
Q: The room.
A2: — the room. This is the room where I would say —
A: And this big cross.
A2: Yes. And you told me, the one thing that’s different is, there 1s — there was this
huge cross that would have been like, over the bed —
A: Right.
Q: Right.
A2: — you know. So I remember that, but the thing that I remember the most is that
you know, every — the group — everyone was aware that this woman didn’t have to
let us in, you know, we had asked if we could see it, and everyone was trying to

kind of — and it was clear that sh — who — di— who — everyone sensed that she had
this feeling like oh, they’re going to take it away, they’re going to take the house
away from me, or something. So we were trying very hard to be like reassuring, and
you know, kind of very appreciative that she was letting us see the house. And the
rest of my mother and the relatives were sort of going back, looking through the
house, and she kind of turned to me, and I was kind of more wa — I was kind of
running interference. I was like talking to her, and letting everyone else see the
house. And there wa — and I said, thank you for letting us see the house, it really
means a lot, you know. And she said, it’s okay. And then there was a silence. And
then she looked at me, and she looked down, and she said, you know, these shoes
are terrible. These shoes hurt so much. I cannot get a pair of shoes that fit me, and I
have a ki— you know, my feet really ache, it’s very hard to walk. I’m so
uncomfortable, my — it’s very uncomfortable my f— terrible, my shoes really hurt.
A: I don’t remember that at all.
A2: And I said — I said, oh yeah, it’s a shame, I’m sorry, you know, that happens.
And she kind of went on with shoes, it’s terrible, these shoes, they —
Q: Well, there’s a significant moment. She realizes who the people are who have
come back, and instead of somehow or other acknowledging this significant

moment, this is what she 1s — this is what — how she is able to handle it, in other
words. Or not handle it.
A2: I— look, I— we couldn’t read her mind.
Q: Of course not.
A2: But, I-I believe that she was —
A: She was asking you to give some money for shoes?
A2: No, no, no, I don’t think that at all.
Q: I mean, that thought crossed my mind, too, maybe.
A2: No, I— she — I didn’t think she was asking, I think she was feeling extremely
uncomfortable. I th — I took it that she felt — well, let me go on, and then I'll tell you
what —
Q: Sure.
A2: — how I — how — [Il — I'll just tell you the facts.
Q: How you — how you took it, yeah.
A2: And then III tell you how I took it.
Q: Right.
A2: It was very odd for us to be there, and for her to be — she wasn’t saying, give
me money for a new pair of shoes. She was saying, it’s terrible, these shoes, they —
Q: Yeah, they kind of hurt, yeah.

A2: — they don’t fit, it really hurts. And then I said, well, that’s a shame, you know,
thanks again, it’s a very nice house. And then she said, oh, the house. It’s — it’s very
hard to maintain. There’s lots of difficulty. It — you — there’s always something that
has to be fixed, and —
A: All this is in German, and you understood it?
A2: It was broken, you know, but I understood it. And I — must have been in broken
English, cause I didn’t speak German, so —
Q: Okay.
A2: It must have been English. But she was sort of ex — she wa — the two things she
communicated to me was, her shoes hurt, she was very uncomfortable, and the
house is — 1s really a burden, but what can you do? And I was sort of ext — I was
kind of nodding and, you know, kind of saying that, gee, that’s a shame. And I was
thinking to myself, you know, you’re — you seem — oh, I remember, there was one
other thing. I said like, oh, you know, how long have you lived here? And she said,
oh, you know, a very long time. And I said oh, like when — like, since when? And
she said oh — she didn’t — she said a lon — you know, had it for a long time. I do —
and then she said something very vague. And so I combined that with her obvious
discomfort, and her saying that the house was a burden, and I thought it was — I
thought she was — I took it to mean that she was dealing with, you know,

ambivalence, and guilt, and discomfort at the part — I believe that somehow, some
way, she was part of stealing the house. Or with — you know, or was complicit with
the Nazis, and that now the people who had been the victims of this act were back,
and you know, she —
Q: Unexpectedly.
A2: — unexpectedly.
Q: Yeah.
A2: And I think she was feeling — and I think that she realized no one was going to
be making a claim against her. This was simply us remembering the — the place
where we had been harmed, and exiled, or my family had been. And I don’t think
she could handle it. So I think the way she handled it was to say, this is really
uncomfortable, these shoes really hurt. Och, it’s terrible. My poor — I —
Q: My poor feet, yeah.
A: I don’t remember that at all.
A2: And I remember just being floored by it.
Q: Well, ee — as I said, it sounds like a very — such a bizarre kind of statement at the
significance — even if it’s not her significance, but significance to people who have
come to her door, and that her mind would not be on, why is this significant for
them, but on something like this.

A: Yes.
Q: She knew that it had been the Lumps.
A2: She said, but you’re not — you’re — you’re — you’re just taking them, right? And
I said no, no, that’s my mother. And then she didn’t know how to answer that.

A2: So it came out a little after this.
Q: Right.
A2: But at the time in Europe, there was a phrase that a lot of people used, called
Holocaust amnesia, because there were in the — 1n the social discussion and in the
politics of Europe at that time, there was — not holo — you know, there was amnesia
about it. And so Judith Miller — th-th — the premise of this book was that, to
counteract Holocaust amnesia, she would tell not the large historical story, but
specific detailed stories.
Q: Individual stories.
A2: That’s why it’s called, “One by One by One.”
A: And she was covering some trial in Germany, and my cousin had written to her,
and that’s why she came.
Q: Okay.
A2: And so, a chapter in the book chronicled her accompanying this group to
Fulda.
Q: Okay.

A2: And so I’m just reading from it, because it’s the same incident with — but a little
more cotemporaneous, I guess.
Q: Okay.
A2: So it says: “But with the surfacing of good memories, came the bad and the
ambivalent. One day, for example, some of the Lumps mustered the courage to
visit their former home. It had been occupied for years by a woman, now very old,
whose husband had probably bought it at auction from the Nazis.” Presumably, the
author of this book researched it, and got her own information. “She let us enter in
stages, said Doris Fingerhood, Rosie’s daughter, who had left Germany for
England when she was 11 years old. The house looked physically much as I
remembered it, only much smaller. I kept thinking, where did my parents put 11
children? But I had remembered the house as full of character, now it was
peculiarly devoid of any. The woman who owned it,” — this is my mother speaking
— “the woman who owned it was 80. She kept saying that she had lived there for 20
years, but knew nothing about how her husband, who was dead, had acquired it. She
was crusty, and very formal, typically German. I didn’t know what to believe, and
that made me uncomfortable. She comp — she complained about her health, about
the cost of keeping up the house. It was so expensive to maintain that she couldn’t
travel, Doris said. Finally, she looked at Steven and me, at our blondish hair and

blue eyes, and said, you don’t look like the Lumps. There was a final shock
awaiting them. Regina’s bedroom was virtually unchanged from the day she had
died there, with one exception. Over what had been the Lump family’s old double
bed hung a large wooden cross. I’m glad my mother could not see it, Doris said
softly.” And then it goes on to talk about other things.
Q: That’s true.
A2: So that’s the history of —
Q: That’s the history from different voices, your voice, your voice —
A: And her voice.
Q: — and jud — and her voice — and Judith Miller’s voice.
A2: Yeah.
Q: I mean, one of the things that I’d like to ask both of you, and this touches — I
mean, your — your story on this touches on that, and that’s that theme of, what do
contacts with Germans, ethnic Germans, non-Jews, what kind of contacts are there,
sO many years after the war, and what kind of feelings do they leave you with? And
Pll preface that also with a thought. I usually try not to be leading, but I get the
impression, after talking to so many people, that one of the most difficult aspects in
this story is — the large story, is the loss of trust, and can trust ever be regained? And
I wonder if that plays a role here. So there’s really two questions.

A: Well, I don’t think I can answer that, but I can tell you for my aunts and uncles,
like Julius, who was a big football player, and —
A2: Soccer.
A: — older — or soccer, or whatever he did. But they met Germans whom they knew,
and they made it possible — they had teas, or coffee, or you know, they had — they
met that older group, with other older groups, and they actually interact — acted.
Now, I wasn’t part of that, but they had the opportunity to meet people that they
knew when they were younger, and growing up.
Q: During this trip to ful —
A: During this trip to Fulda. Th-There were definite meetings, when the Germans
could meet the people like my relatives who had lived in Fulda. How it went, I
can’t really tell you.
A2: You don’t remember any comment?
A: I think some were quite positive.
A2: I think so too.
Q: Okay. And what about your own feeling?

who had arranged this, did a very good job, because it seemed successful.

A2: That’s true, but you’re not answering how — the question is like, how did it
leave you, in terms of feeling you could trust people or not?
A: I was just glad I wasn’t there any more. I mean, I — I didn’t like Germany, I
didn’t like the atmosphere.
Q: Even then, in 1987, in Fulda.
A: Right.
Q: Okay.
A: But I was glad I was there, that I could absorb. Like we went to my
grandmother’s grave, and that was very important to me. I was glad to have the
connection more personally, but I wouldn’t want to be there.
Q: Okay. So, in that sense, what was broken couldn’t really be repaired.
A: No.
Q: What about you?
A2: Well, I kind of had to somewhat —
Q: And I’m not just talking about the Fulda trip, but if that 1s the catalyst, if that’s

A: But not in that context.

April 27, 2017
A2: No, not in that context. You know, I think that — I think that it’s — I don’t — I-I
think two things. I don’t think it’s a — I don’t think it’s nearly as simple as, the
Germans did something bad to the Jews. That’s certainly true, but it’s also true —
although it’s horrific to say — that there were Gentile friends of Rose and Leo who
risked their lives to save — to hide them, until 1944. And the — they — they perished
instead of surviving the war, because of a f — fellow Jew, who — who ratted them
out, you know.
A: So it’s very complicated.
A2: So I don’t think — I — if there’s an us versus them, it — it’s not Germans versus
Jews, you know. So I’m — but, you know, I don’t think — it’s one thing to read about
horrible things in the paper, or in history books, but when you see it through your
own family, or your mother or grandparents, it’s very dark. And the idea that
neighbors didn’t know what was going on, to me 1s —
A: Hard to believe.
A2: —1s nonsense. And — and it — to me, it was the little things, like the reaction of
this woman, that just betrayed the fact that — you know, there was lots of complicity
in — in bad acts. And so, I don’t feel like, oh I can’t trust Germans. And I’ve been to
Germany a lot, and —
Q: Since then?

April 27, 2017
A2: Yes. And you know, in the modern wor — I mean, the interesting thing, by the
way, is that one big contingent of visitors on this trip to Fulda were Germans who
had emigrated to Israel. And they — and you know, Israel and Germany have a
very functional relationship right now. And Germany is important to Israel’s
economy. And what I found interesting was that the Israelis had — had gotten over
this a long time ago. Israelis did not exhibit a lot of ambivalence, or —
A: Interesting.
A2: — you know, emotional complication. American Jews did. Israeli Jews had
other problems.
Q: So, that’s also interesting.
A2: So I-I guess — first of all, [indecipherable] fascinated —
A: That’s very interesting. I didn’t even think about that.
A2: But, I mean, what I want to say is like I — I found it scarring. I found the
experience scarring, you know, just kind of feeling like I was reliving through my
mother, you know, or her relatives, like what had happened. I think it was a hugely
traumatic thing. And I think everyone has, you know, lived remarkably good lives,
given such a rip in the entire family support system, fabric. And look, that happened
to a lot of people in that time, but this was really acute.

Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood
April 27, 2017
Q: One reason that I ask that, is that willy or nilly, we are having this conversation
several generations after the events. And the fact that we have it so many years,
decades after the events, when there are several — that influences us. How you speak
of something — you don’t have different facts, but how you speak of the facts 10
years afterwards, two years afterwards, and 50 years afterwards, changes somewhat,
is influenced by things. And today, there are young Germans who, I’ve heard often
say — and it’s not the only voice. It’s not the only voice, but they say, this happened
such a long time ago. This has nothing to do with me. Why can’t I be taken by who
Iam —
A: Right.
Q: — rather than by all this? Why do I have to apologize for something that even not
my parents did, but maybe even my grandparents didn’t? And part of why I’m
asking these questions is to provide a window to what makes — if that is the case, or
not, you know? Does that —
A2: Let me take that point and narrow it into like a very specific mini-example,
cause I understand that feeling. So when we were on this trip, my mother said, this
at the beginning, Lufthansa provided transportation, or was part of it, and there was
a sizable contingent of people who were kosher, who were Orthodox and kosher.
And the — some of the events that someone in Germany catered was, they had to

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Dorothea Fingerhood ms
April 27, 2017
provide kosher food. Well, there are, you know 30 Jews in — in — in Fulda at the
time, and it was a — it was a production. And I don’t really know how they did it,
cause we don’t keep kosher, but I think it involved getting food from, you know,
further away places. And I remember at one of these events, speaking not to a
dignitary or anything like that, just to some — some kind of a guy who was working
— I forget if he was part of the catering, or part of Lufthansa, but he was one of the
people that arranged for this food to be provided to the kosher people. And I was
making — you know, I was sort of just having casual conversation with him, sort of,
because it was — I w — it was just interesting to me that thi-this was like a very — I
was part of this visible, the Jews of Fulda back there. And I said something like
wow, quite an event, and I think he spoke reasonable enough English. And he said
yes. And he said, you know, it’s — he basically said it’s really very expensive, and
very difficult to have to get this kosher food. And it’s really a big production, and
we — he —I don’t think he — he basically said, we have better things to do.
Q: Ah, so it was with this kind of attitude.
A2: It was like — and — and I don’t think he was being angry, but it was very
interesting, because his perception was exactly what you were saying about like
why — I’m not res — his whole perception was, look, I-I’m a young person, I’m not
responsible for whatever happened in the past. Somehow or another, we have to run

all over the place to get this kosher food, for this group of people that are visiting.
Why do we have to do this, you know? It’s a big — it’s a big —
Q: Pain.
A2: — burden. It’s a big pain. And I don’t get it. And so he was not, at all, welcome
back, you know, I know a bad thing happened, we’re making a huge effort. It was
more like, why the hell am I doing this? And I thought to myself, well, you know, if
—if this group hadn’t killed, or exiled these people, they would have their own
thriving community, they could get their own kosher foods, so it’s really the least
you can do, to be inconvenienced.
Q: Yeah.
A2: So — but there are both sides, you know. I don’t know what to say.
Q: So you could see — you could see his point of view.
A2: I c—I understand someone saying, we didn’t do this. Hell, you Americans, I —
what are you doing for the native American Indians, or you know, or — that’s your
promise? And — so, I’m not particularly persuaded by that point of view.

Q: Yes.
A2: I mean —
Q: Thank you for bringing that in, because we’re talking — you — we’re talking
individuals. I’m not — I’m ad — I’m sometimes reflecting something that’s in the air

A2: I mean, I—I—I would just add one more thing —
Q: Sure.
A2: — and I am s — rem — so removed from it, but my impression is that — you know,
Weimar Germany, | guess, was really collapsing. People turned to a strong,
authoritarian dictator because they thought it was the only way to get things done.
And I think once Hitler — I think Hitler very quickly, you know, empowered the
worst, lowest, most brutal, most criminal elements. And I think once that happened,

A: No, but I think it’s true.
A2: — cheering on Nazis when you’re rounding people up, but I — but you know, I
do think —
Q: Some people had no power, who were not direct victims. Some people, like the
ones who saved your mother and father for a while, were also very anti-Nazi, but
they couldn’t show it.
A2: Absolutely.
A: That’s right.
Q: And other may not have been that, but they didn’t like what wer — they saw. You

happened, and so we have to find our way through that world. So —
