>> Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program First
Person. Thank you for joining us. We began the 18th year of the First Person
Program yesterday and our first person today is Ms. Susan Taube, which we will meet
shortly. This is made possible by the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional
funding from Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation. We are grateful for their
sponsorship.

First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who
share firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of the First
Person guests serves as volunteers here at the museum. Our program will continue
twice weekly through mid-August. The museum's website at www.ushmm.org
provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests. Anyone
interested in keeping in touch with the museum and its programs can complete the
stay connected card you'll find in your program or speak with a museum representative
at the back of the theater.

In doing so you will receive an electronic copy of Susan's biography so that you
can remember and share her testimony after you leave today.

Susan will share with us today her First Person account of her experience
during the Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows, we will
have an opportunity for you to ask Susan some questions. The life stories of
Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear from Susan is
one individual's account of the Holocaust.

We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her introduction, and

We begin with this portrait of Susan Taube, born Susan Strauss.

Susan grew up in the small town of Vacha, Germany, where her family lived
more than 400 years.

On this map of Europe, the arrow points to Germany.

This picture shows Susan's home and her family's business in Vacha. The
Strauss home is on the right-hand side of the storefront.

Here we see Susan and her mother, Bertha Strauss together in a field near their
home in Vacha.

In November 1938 the Nazis unleashed a wave of pogroms throughout
Germany known as Kristallnacht or the "The Night of Broken Glass."

This photograph shows Germans passing the broken window of a Jewish
owned business destroyed during Kristallnacht.

In Vacha, local party members damaged the family store and imprisoned
Susan's father in the Buchenwald concentration camp.

In 1939, Susan, sister, mother and grandmother moved to Berlin.

Susan and her family were deported to the Riga ghetto in January 1942.

The arrow on this map points to Riga.

Eventually Susan and her mother were sent to the Kaiserwald concentration
camp, which the first arrow points, to do forced labor. In the fall of 1944 as the Soviet
army approached, Susan and her family were deported to the Stutthof concentration
camp which the second arrow points to.

This is a photo of the Stutthof concentration camp.

After the war, Susan married and immigrated with her husband Herman Taube
and her family to the United States. In this photograph we see Susan, Herman and
two of their children in the family store.

Susan lives in the Washington, D.C. area, her beloved husband Herman passed
away March 25th, 2014, three years ago next week.

Herman, who we miss, was a Holocaust survivor and a First Person guest.
Susan and Herman ran their own small business, a store in Baltimore, for many years
before moving to Washington, D.C. 42 years ago.

She co-authored several books with Herman who is a noted author and poet.
Susan and Herman have four children, eight grandchildren and eight
great-grandchildren. Five live in Israel. The oldest of the great-grandchildren is in
college and the youngest is a year old.

Susan is joined today by her daughter Judy. We have Susan and Judy in the
front row.

Susan is active with the Holocaust Survivors Association and volunteers here
weekly at the museum. You will find her here on Tuesdays when she helps staff the
membership and donor desk.

Susan has also spoken frequently at the museum. As an example, she spoke
to a German group that promotes reconciliation. She has also spoken in other settings
locally, including synagogues and schools and after we finish the program today,
Susan is going to go back out through the doors you came in to the top of the stairs
where she will sign copies of several of Herman's books. And with that | would like to
ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mrs. Susan Taube.

[Applause]

Susan, thank you so much for being willing to be our First Person and joining us
today. You have so much to share with us. We have just a short time, so we'll start
right away.

You were just seven and living in the small town of Vacha, Germany, when
Hitler came to power in 1933. After that, of course, your life and that of your families
changed dramatically. Start by telling us about your family and your life in the years
leading up to Kristallnacht, before then, what was your family's life like? Tell us about
your family.

>> Susan Taube: Well, as you said, | was born in the small town in the middle of
Germany. In the town there were about 30 Jewish families, and life was normal.
Normal life. Very few children, because -- | started school in 1932, and in 1934, | went
to higher education school, but then 1936 | had to leave school. No Jewish children
were allowed anymore in the German schools. And | was sent to Frankfurt am Main
and attended there.

In 1938 --
>> Bill Benson: Before we go to Kristallnacht, let me ask you some questions. What
did your father do to earn a living? What was his living?
>> Susan Taube: My father had a family store for many years already. Actually, my
grandfather on my mother's side died in World War I, he was a soldier in the German
Army, fighting for Germany in World War I, and my grandmother was a widow and she
ran a store. And my mother grew older, she helped and eventually my mother got
married and the store went on until Hitler came to power.
>> Bill Benson: Speaking of Hitler coming to power, you told me about the family that
were neighbors of yours, and you told me an incident about voting. Will you share that
with us? Do you remember they went to vote?
>> Susan Taube: When Hitler came to power. Yeah, the elections in Germany, and
we all had to go to the port, and whoever voted, you had to work for Hitler because you
received a little... what you call it? Yeah, | voted for Hitler, and you would be -- even
though caught without it on the street, without it, even the Jewish people voted for
Hitler because nobody knew what was in store for them in the future, so... we all voted
for Hitler.
>> Bill Benson: At some point | think even before Kristallnacht you started having
vandalism done to your family business.
>> Susan Taube: Yeah, when Hitler came to power, then they were against the
Jewish people. We had a display window in our business, big display windows and
they were smashed in at night. And once we. Fixed them up again, they put the paint,
and they put it on the house, and it was quite a few times we had to replace the
windows. In the beginning, insurance paid for it and then insurance wouldn't pay for it
anymore, we had to do it ourselves. But eventually we bolted up, that's it.
>> Bill Benson: Then you started to tell us about Kristallnacht. What do you -- you
were still a girl. What do you remember about Kristallnacht?
>> Susan Taube: As | said, | had to live with my -- in the little town, | couldn't go to
school anymore. | was separated completely from the other children, sitting on a
bench all by myself right next to the door, the first one to leave and the last one to
come in. My parents saw my mental situation became -- | don't know what you call it.
Depression, | guess. So they enlisted me in a Jewish school in Frankfurt am Main,
and | lived with complete strangers. In 1938, Kristallnacht happened. There was a
young Jewish man in Paris -- in 1938, the Polish -- the Jewish people who were not
Polish -- German citizens, born in Germany for generations already, you couldn't just
become a German citizen because you were born there. You became -- you became
a citizen from your parents. Living in Germany many years, polish children are still
Polish.

Just picked up without any warning, put on a train and put on the border of
Poland and Germany, and there's no place to go, no man's land.

SO a young man who was studying in Paris at that time, he found out what was
happening to his parents, he tried to bring the attention to what is happening. He went
to the German embassy in Paris and killed one of the officers there. So when that
happened, a few weeks later, they organized what they called a pogrom. It was just an
excuse to demolish all owned by Jewish people or whatever was owned by Jewish
people was demolished. And the men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.

And all the schools were closed, because all the teachers were arrested too.
And | just went back home to my hometown at that time. My mother was there. She
had to close the business up. It couldn't open up anymore. And my father was in a
concentration camp for about four weeks. He was dismissed because he was in the
World War |. He was one of the first one to let go.

How do you call it?

He had a job in certain time
>> Bill Benson: They would let him out of the concentration, but he had --
>> Susan Taube: They didn't want to spread the word what was happening.
>> Bill Benson: A veteran in the German Army.
>> Susan Taube: Luckily, we looked to immigrate already --
>> Bill Benson: Let me ask you another question about Kristallnacht. In addition to
destroying businesses, your home was vandalized?
>> Susan Taube: Yes, | went to school in Frankfurt am Main and they just knocked
down the door, came in and they destroyed the whole apartment, crying out from the
couples, and everything was demolished.
>> Bill Benson: They knocked bookcases over.
>> Susan Taube: Busted out the windows. It was terrible. And they went from
apartment to apartment and did the same thing.
>> Bill Benson: Before your father was arrested, if | remember correctly, he was -- he
hid for a couple days and the Gestapo came.
>> Susan Taube: Gestapo came and said, if he doesn't give himself up, you have to
take my mother into the camp. So my father gave himself up and they took him to
Buchenwald, where he worked for four weeks, and let go because he was a World
War | veteran. He had to leave Germany right away. He couldn't stay in Germany.

SO we were ready to emigrate. Things became bad in Germany. We didn't see
any future there anymore. But we had no place to go. We wanted to go to America.
Relatives in America, somebody to vouch for you. And even if you found somebody to
vouch for you, they had to put a certain amount of money in the bank and then you
received a number and you had to wait for your number to come up. And a lot of
people wanted to immigrate and the number was very high and when we found out
how -- when it would be, they told us it would be about four years before our number
would be called.

In the meantime, came Kristallnacht and my father was arrested, and he was let
go, but...
>> Bill Benson: So you couldn't immigrate, you couldn't get out because of the delays
and the requirements and all the things described. So what did he do? What did your
father do then?
>> Susan Taube: He went over the border and he paid somebody to go over the
border, without anything, a little suitcase and just what he had on his body, and a lot

)
of -- it happened to a lot of people at that time, and a lot of people went this way, left
Germany this way, but the Jewish community in Belgium welcomed everybody, and
they couldn't work or do anything like that, but they had soup kitchens there and
people took them in and gave them food. So while in Belgium his number came up for
immigration to America, and because he had left, the papers had to go to Belgium, and
that prolonged the whole system about six months, eight months. And in the
meantime the war broke out, so that stopped everything. But he made it out just
before America went into the war, just before they invaded Belgium, just before they
invaded Belgium, he made it out. He got to America in February of 1940.
>> Bill Benson: 1940, right?
>> Susan Taube: Something like that, yeah. 1941.
>> Bill Benson: So here you are with your mother and your grandmother, and | think
you moved to Berlin to be close to the U.S. consulate in the hope that you might still --
>> Susan Taube: We might still go to America. So we moved to Berlin. My mother
worked to sell the house. She was the only Jewish family still living in that small town,
and life was just miserable for her. So she sold the property, almost gave it away.
She never received the money for it because after 1938, after Kristallnacht, all the
money was confiscated, and you received only a certain amount for your expenses,
what you need for food and whatever. But only a certain amount of money. You
couldn't have any more. And the money stayed with the government.

And then we moved to Berlin. We received -- my mother, my sister, my
grandmother, father's mother still with us, and myself, and a lot of little towns where
Jewish people moved away to bigger cities, so we were what you called...
>> Bill Benson: Crowded together?
>> Susan Taube: Crowded together, right. We had one bedroom, communal living
room, communal kitchen, communal bathroom, just one private bedroom, that's all,
and you all slept in one bedroom.

Life in Berlin, by that time | was a teenager. | had to go to work. So my first job
was as a day care worker to take care of children. Because all had to work for the war
effort. They all had to work in factories for the war machinery. And the children got up
at 6:00 in the morning. We had to be there at 6:00 until morning until 9:00 o'clock at
night when the last child was picked up. And we had to take public transportation.
And also in 1939, it was, or '40 we all received the honor of wearing a nice yellow star,
and we had to wear it on our outer clothes so we would be recognized for whoever we
are. And that wasn't a very pleasant situation because we had to use public
transportation at that time, and, you know, when you're young and branded like this,
you tried to hide it. But if you were caught hiding it, you received a punishment too.

So anyhow, | worked in the children's home and they got dropped off in the
morning and worked all day until 8:00 o'clock at night and then went home, and that
was it. Seven days a week.
>> Bill Benson: And, Susan, the deportation started and you and your family were
deported to Riga, Latvia.
>> Susan Taube: Started in the fall of 1941, and what happened there, we lived
with -- there was another gentleman living and another lady, and the daughter of the
gentleman lived a few blocks away and one day he tried to get in touch with her and
there was no answer. Didn't know what happened to her. About two weeks later he

received a note from Poland, your father, due to circumstances, German citizen from
Poland will be resettled to Germany. We are settled here. We are fine, don't worry
about us. You will hear from us again. And that was the only time he heard from
them, nothing else.

Then slowly deportation started and the next one | knew about was my best
girlfriend. It became very organized then. You received a notice by mail, so and so,
this day you be ready, you will be resettled to the east. You can take with you what
you can carry. Everything else, what you would like to take, bigger items, you leave at
a certain place and it will be shipped to your new destination. Never told where or
where it goes to or where we are going or whatever. We were never told.

Our time came, my mother, my grandmother, my sister, myself, in the winter we
worked actually in factories, and we thought if you worked for the war effort, you kind
of exempt --
>> Bill Benson: Be exempt from that?
>> Susan Taube: But, no, that didn't help any.
>> Bill Benson: If | remember right you were in a factory making submarine
equipment.
>> Susan Taube: Receivers for submarines. And the Jewish people, the Jewish
employees were kept separately from the Christian people. The Christian people
received lunches, food. We received nothing.
>> Bill Benson: And they received pay?
>> Susan Taube: Pay was not -- pay was nothing at all.
>> Bill Benson: And you were told that if you were suspected of any sabotage you
would be executed?
>> Susan Taube: Better not, yeah.

So we worked -- where was |?
>> Bill Benson: Deportation to Riga.
>> Susan Taube: We received a notification to be ready on this and this day. You can
take with you what you can carry. Everything else you bring to a certain place and it
will be shipped to your new destination. So first of all we put a lot of clothes on. The
Gestapo came and said it would come. Show us all your bank books, paper. Money
you can take with you for transportation, public transportation. Everything you leave
here, and this is it. You sign your papers, you sign the note.

So we took our little package. We couldn't take much. And we took public
transportation in Kristallnacht, the point of concentration for all the people. It was
Friday night, | remember that, and eventually, about 100,000 people. Children, young
people, old people, mixture of population. And it became -- we had a lot of clothes on
us. We figured what we have on us we can take. But anyway, they stayed in that
place for about two or three days. You were registered. Again, we had one more ID
left. So you would be recognized. Nobody has passports anymore, they were
confiscated. That was taken away from us too. And then we found out we would be
resettled to a place called Riga, Latvia. Okay, Riga, Latvia.

Sunday morning, we were assembled in front of the synagogue and we were
marched to a station in Berlin, the capital of Berlin, and we looked for the train to be
resettled to Riga. And what we saw was the cattle cars. Only cattle cars. The doors
were opened and we looked inside and went inside and there were benches made out

of straw all around the wall, on each side of the end of the wagon. A bucket of water.
That was it.

Once the train was full, everybody was in, we went, we traveled four days and
four nights | remember. Very cold winter in January 1942. It was very, very cold. No
heat in the wagons, nothing.

We arrived in Riga the end of January -- no, beginning of February, it was, end
of January. | don't remember exactly the date. End of January, | think it was. And
they opened up the wagons, out, out, out. Everybody out. You could hardly move
because of the cold. You were stiff. Old people couldn't move. We were told if you
can -- you have to walk about 10-kilometers, if you cannot walk, there are trucks, you
can go in the trucks and we'll take you to your new destination. Well, the people who
went on the truck, we never saw again. It was mostly older people, children, it was
hard to walk for them. They went on the trucks and we never saw them again. My
family, we walked. We walked 10-kilometers, slow in ice, very slowly. It took almost
the whole day. And we came to a place in Riga, which was -- what was it called? A
section of the city of Riga, a very poor section it was. We came to the place and they
pushed us in apartments and no light, no heat, nothing. And we saw food laying there
and clothes everywhere around the place. We didn't know what happened. But it was
nighttime. We didn't give it much thought. So we found a place to sit and sat down
and that was it. In the morning when daylight came we looked around, we went
outside and a lot of ice and snow and force of elements. Terrible sight.

So we didn't know what happened. Back to the house, no food, nothing.
Eventually we received a piece of bread. There was some food left in the apartment,
which we eventually figured out we eat. And February 5th, | remember this like today,
everybody out of the buildings, everybody assemble in the street. The place was
surrounded, two times. Completely surrounded. You couldn't go out of the place
there. And we were assembled and looked over and the trucks were staying there.
And they looked us over and just like this, this, this... if you went this way, you went on
the truck, and you went this way, you went back to the house. My grandmother was
taken away from us. My mother, my sister and myself, we went back into the house.
>> Bill Benson: Susan, | remember you telling me that they would tell the elderly
people that were with you who were going to put you in a fish factory where you can
work indoors.
>> Susan Taube: The second time around, yeah. Well, in the meantime there came
transports from all over Germany, Austria, back from Germany, Jewish people,
transported there. And eventually the ghetto was overflowing, and in February -- end
of February, again, everybody out of the house, selections were coming and people
taken away, always taken away.

A lot of children they are taking away and invalid people. People they figured
could work, they kept them alive for a while.
>> Bill Benson: Susan, you would remain in the Riga ghetto for 20 months, from the
end of January, early February 1942 to December 1943. Tell us what your life was like
in the Riga ghetto over those 20 months, what you were forced to do, and you touched
on this a little bit, but the image you described of arriving in a place that is just covered
in ice, indoors, outdoors, just a coating of thick ice on everything, and | think the very
first job you were made to do was to --

https://collections.ushmm.org

>> Susan Taube: Go to the city of Riga and supplied us with --
>> Bill Benson: Like iron rods? Ice picks.
>> Susan Taube: Ice picks. We had to loosen the ice from the sidewalk so the
citizens of Riga could walk on the sidewalks. We were not allowed to walk on the
sidewalks. We had to walk in the streets. Before we went through, a piece of dry
bread, nothing warm to eat all this time, nothing at all. Just bread. And that was it.

So we marched to the city and worked all day from morning, daylight until
nighttime came, and back to the ghetto. Back to the ghetto there was nothing to look
forward to. If you were lucky, somebody in the street gave you something to eat,
actually. Some citizens of the street. And then eventually we received some food in
the ghetto. It was organized. We received some rations in the ghetto, but no place to
cook or anything like that, so people became-engineers, the people there, they found
scraps of iron or whatever it is and they build little stoves from it. And while we went to
work and found a piece of wood or something, we picked it up and took it home and
that's how we cooked our stuff.
>> Bill Benson: You shared with me there was an attempt by all the Jews there to try
to create some sense of a community while you were there, try to do some education if
possible.
>> Susan Taube: The children still were in school, like the day care center. They
were never allowed to go in the streets, the children. They were always supervised by
old people in homes -- | mean, in rooms, wherever they were living. Or they had a day
care center for children, and the towns had to go to work, and they had the children
and dropped them off and they never could go outside. They were never allowed to go
outside, the children.
>> Bill Benson: What was the other work you were forced to do while you were there?
>> Susan Taube: Besides shoveling snow, the next job | worked for the air force.

That was a good job, because inside you are not exposed to the cold weather. And we
sat in the basement and sorted out potatoes. They delivered the food to them, but
everything was frozen. So we had to pick out the good ones from the bad ones. And
that was good, because the bad ones we could take home with us. Actually, we were
allowed to take home, but they tasted horrible.

But, again, you know, you work for the military, some people had a human
heart. You could find some human beings among them. And | say that -- if you didn't
have someone -- not to look out for you, but have a little bit of feeling what was going
on and help you a little bit, that's life really.
>> Bill Benson: At some point you were forced to go outside the ghetto, | think, to
dig...
>> Susan Taube: That was in the summertime. They called it peat moss, and they
use it for heating and cooking, and so -- and they would take the young girls, mostly
young girls and young men and send outside the ghetto about 40 or 50-kilometers
outside the ghetto, and there were big fields and we had to dig out peat moss from
there, and that was dug out and put on bridges and put on the lawn to be dried and
turned over and dried up again, and then it was shipped into the city. And that was --
>> Bill Benson: Used as fuel for the citizens there?
>> Susan Taube: Yes. Not too bad, actually. We went swimming a little bit. You
know, a reprieve of some sort for a while.

>> Bill Benson: Late August or September 1943 you were brought back into the ghetto
and what you said to me was, we kind of knew what the ball game was then. That was
a quote from you.
>> Susan Taube: Well, we heard news. We had some kind of -- we didn't have radios
or anything like that. Nobody had a radio, but the places we worked had radios, and if
you had a chance, you could always listen to the news, and there was always -- the
good news was the Germans had a successful retreat, always a successful retreat.
Very slow. In Riga, until 1944, the ghetto was liquidated and we all went to
concentration camps. Actually concentration camp. Men and women were separated.
There were no more children there. Everybody had to go to work. Mostly young
people, no old people anymore. But, again, | have to say, | was lucky. Before the
ghetto was liquidated there was an organization, and the German Army, they made
bridges and we came to this place and we had to repair the boats.

The situation was also like a reprieve for us really, because the one who
oversaw it was a civilian, a German civilian, and he was one of five sons. Four were
already gone on the front. So anyone alive was made a director of the facility. | have
to say he had a human heart. He could -- not help us, but make it more pleasant than
it's Supposed to be.
>> Bill Benson: He could have made it worse?
>> Susan Taube: He had a human heart, put it this way. But he couldn't help us
anyway. And the Russian army came closer and we evacuated, the whole army, Riga,
the German Army, so the ghetto was eliminated and old people disappeared. And
people who were able to work were put on a boat.
>> Bill Benson: Before you go there, as you were being evacuated from Kaiserwald,
you explained this was mid 1944, the summer of 1944, you said there was a period
where you were just waiting, and groups of young people were sent out. Do you
remember telling me that?
>> Susan Taube: You know, Riga had a very nice population, Jewish population at
that time, but when they came in, all but 4,000 men eliminated. They kept 4,000 men
to work, but all eliminated.

By the end, when the German and Russian army came closer, they wanted to
get -- cover up what they did, | guess, and the people from Kaiserwald, they organized
groups of 40 men each day. They had to go out. And whoever went on the job during
the day, they never came back. They killed them there. Because they didn't want any
witnesses.
>> Bill Benson: The next day another group of 40.
>> Susan Taube: Next day, another 40, another 40...

And what was left then, we were all deported on a boat and shipped to
Germany, concentration, which was an extermination.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about Stutthof.
>> Susan Taube: Beautiful lawns, beautiful flowers. We thought we were in heaven.
We walk in, the picture changed very quickly. Nothing but barracks. People walking
around, hungry, miserable, shaved their heads. Our heads were shaved before we left
Riga actually. We were all bald, no hair on our heads.

And life in Kaiserwald was in the morning, 5:00 o'clock. Just like sardines. At
that time we had wooden shoes.

Luckily, | was only about two weeks in Stutthof. Stutthof, Germany, right?
Yeah, Stutthof, they took us out. One day they counted and counted, counted 400
women, took us from the camp, put us on the train and sent us to a place called
Sophienwalde. They arrived there, the camp was made out of plywood, little huts
made out of plywood, and each hut pushed 15 people, only straw on the floor, nothing
else. One blanket we had.

And so the first thing we didn't know what to do. The next day we had to get
out. We were called out. The whistle blew and we had to get out and be counted.
There were ladies from the SS, we had three, three ladies. Martha, Erica and...

One was a beast. One was more human. And the other one couldn't care less
as long as she had a boyfriend. She was okay.

So that was our lives. So every day we had to go to work in the morning. We
received shovels and picks and stuff, and we marched to woods and we had to take
out the wood from the ground, because they were supposed to build a military exercise
camp there.
>> Bill Benson: You had to dig out all the roots?
>> Susan Taube: We had to get all the roots out from the trees. It was hard work. It
wasn't easy. We were girls, not men. We didn't have muscles. But we had to do it,
pull them out and then we had to push them over to a dump where everything was
dumped. Then back to the woods and fill it up again. And that was our day's work.

We received a piece of bread in the evening and a piece of bread when we
came back from work, and if you had a bowl, if you were lucky and had a bowl, you
received a bowl of soup and that was our nourishment
>> Bill Benson: In the late winter of 1945 as the Russians advanced, you were
evacuated from there and forced to go on what is known as a death march?
>> Susan Taube: They took us to this unfinished building that we built, and in the
basement, we were there. But, again, no heat, no nothing. Just one piece of bread
and a soup.

February, Russian army came much closer, and one day the commander came
and said -- assembled us and said, look, we cannot stay here. The Russians are here.
We have to migrate from here. If you're able to walk, you sign up, you can walk. And
if you are not able to walk, you stay here and somebody will take care of you.

Well, the ones who signed up, they marched out and the ones who stayed
behind, we never heard from them again.

We marched ten days. Every day, kilometer, kilometer, wooden shoes, flimsy
coat, not much.
>> Bill Benson: And especially brutal winter.
>> Susan Taube: 1942 --
>> Bill Benson: 1945?
>> Susan Taube: Terrible, terrible cold winter. Walking on ice and snow and walking
through villages, and kids were throwing snowballs at us. It was just terrible. At night
they put us in a barn and in the morning we march again. And that was it for ten days
until we came to a place called Sophienwalde.

Sophienwalde we entered the camp. It was -- it used to be POW camp for
Russian POWs, and they already evacuated too. So we went in there. Then we went
there it was empty but eventually it filled up because people came from all over the

place. There were camps everywhere, where people worked all over eastern
Germany, and from the camps, the Russian army came closer, we were all
concentrated in that place. | don't know, | have no idea.

We went to this place two weeks, three weeks. Again, the Russian army came
close. We heard the shooting already. And they assembled us, we cannot stay here.
lf you can march, we have to leave. And most of us went at that time. And we
marched a whole night and we came to a place in the morning, and they put us ina
barn and closed the door, and that was it. They left us there.

Well, we laid down. There were animals there, and just -- in the early morning
hours, we heard big booms, and we said, oh, no, they're coming closer, they're meant
for us. But it was the Russian army that was chasing the German Army. And we were
liberated by the Russian army on March 10th, 1945.

The doors were opened. We went out. The German people packed their
wagons because they wanted to go west away from the Russian army. And they
packed what they could take with them. And we became -- what do you call it? Well,
we had our first food, and my first food was a piece of bacon.

| got sick. | sure got sick.

Yeah. They told us, don't eat anything. We were told not to eat anything at all
because our stomachs couldn't take any food. Just couldn't take food.

So the Russians took us to work. They said you could work for the Germans,
you can work for us too.

So we were taken to a farm, German farm, where the people had left already
also. And we had to clear the fields, put the seeds down, take care of the animals that
were left there. But we were cleaned up. We got clean clothes, and we had food,
potatoes in the morning, potatoes at noon, and potatoes at night. Potato was the
mainstay. Soon enough we all looked beautiful.
>> Bill Benson: Speaking of looking beautiful, Susan, and | know our time is running
short, that leads, of course, to you having to tell us how you met your future husband.
Will you do that?
>> Susan Taube: Well, the farm was finished and everything was in the ground and
taken care of, the next job was the Russians took us to a city called Kielce and the
German population left and we had to clean out the houses and put them in whatever
we found in the houses, went into warehouses and shipped to Russia. Don't forget the
Germans -- it was all sent to Russia, and that was our job. We didn't cook for
ourselves. We had a communal kitchen. At that time there were ten girls, all lived in
an apartment, and ten girls, but we didn't cook for ourselves. There was a communal
kitchen run by a Jewish officer from Romania, and one day we went there to eat and
that was it. But the people ate there. And one day a young man showed up there and
we have survivors here and we have some sick people here. How about you look after
these people and take a look, if you can help a sick person.

So he went and he looked at my friend, and while he was a doctor in the
Russian army, and that's how | met my husband, who was a doctor in the Russian
army at that time.
>> Bill Benson: There's more to it than that, because -- if | can share a little bit, the
young women were worried about the Russian soldiers that were around, so --
>> Susan Taube: We had to protect ourselves very much.

>> Bill Benson: Herman put up a sign saying, this group of women are under
quarantine for infectious disease. And then the story continues. He did some bribing
with vodka?
>> Susan Taube: And take me out of there...
>> Bill Benson: And got you in a tank that he had gotten somebody to drive with you in
the tank.
>> Susan Taube: Out of the place, yeah. Then we went -- together we went to -- he
was in the Russian army, a doctor in the Russian army, and we went and occupied
east part of Germany. We were in eastern Germany for a while, and then we went
back to Poland and we got married. And we lived in Poland for a while until 19 -- what
was it?

The Polish didn't like very much when the Jewish people came back to the
cities, which they occupied in the meantime, and they wanted the houses back. So
they organized the pogrom in the city of Kielce, and killed all the Jewish people who
came back from the camp. And that we wanted to stay in Poland. There was no
future for Jewish people in Poland, and there were organizations, Jewish organizations
that took people out of Poland and that's where we wound up in east Germany.
>> Bill Benson: Susan, in the little time we have left, how did you locate your father, as
you told us earlier, had made it to the United States?
>> Susan Taube: My father made it out, just before America went into the war. And |
kept his address in my head the whole time. | never forgot his address. And when we
were liberated and back and forth, we didn't have anywhere to go, | had a letter
prepared just in case | had an opportunity somehow. So one time along the way | saw
an American soldier and | asked him if he would do me a favor and deliver this letter to
this address. And he did. And that's how my father knew that I'm alive. But we
couldn't correspond because | had no permanent address yet. So once | had a
permanent address, | wrote to him again, and that's how we got in touch.
>> Bill Benson: When did you finally get to the United States?
>> Susan Taube: We came in 1947.
>> Bill Benson: Two years after the war ended.
>> Susan Taube: We went back to Poland. We wanted to stay in Poland, actually, but
after that pogrom we left. So we went to Germany and at that time America opened up
the doors, which were very closed before the war, but the doors were opened up and
we came to America. Since my father was in America, he vouched for us too, SO we
came to America.
>> Bill Benson: Susan, when did you learn about what happened to your mother and
sister?
>> Susan Taube: Well, we were separated in Riga. | went to one work camp, they
went to another work camp. We had no control over our lives. After the war, |
remember now | kept in touch with a woman who worked together with my mother in
the last camp, and she told me what happened to my mother. My mother died actually
of natural causes in that camp, from starvation. But she always taught me she was
good. She had a job. She was the cleaning lady, so she didn't have to work too hard.
And she also got -- typhus broke out and she died and so did my sister.
>> Bill Benson: We have questions from the audience, is that okay?

lf you don't mind we have -- our ushers have microphones and we're going to

ask that if you have a question, please make sure you have a microphone so it will be
passed down to you. Please make your question as brief as you can, and | will repeat
the question just to make sure that we not only hear it here but everybody hears it in
the audience. So who would like to ask Susan a question, if anybody would? We
have a couple minutes to do this. We have one here. Thank you, sir.

>> How well were you received in the United States and how were you
employed or your husband employed once you came back to the states?
>> Bill Benson: The question is: How were you received once you got to the United
States and how did you basically financially manage, how did Herman find work and
yourself?
>> Susan Taube: The Jewish community in America was very generous at that time,
and they had sponsors, and they helped quite a bit. The Jewish community helped.
Our first -- well, we came to my father. My father was here, so didn't have to worry too
much with my family, but we received help. We did receive help, yes. And my
husband didn't speak English. | spoke a little English, | learned in school, and his first
job was in the Jewish bakery cutting bagels at night. That's what he did.
>> Bill Benson: And then he learned English?
>> Susan Taube: Night school. We all went to night school. Every night, night school.
>> Bill Benson: And when you --
>> Susan Taube: And wrote quite a few books.
>> Bill Benson: Quite a few books. We have another question. We have one right
there in the middle. Yes?

>> Were you able to observe Shabbat or any of the holidays at all?
>> Bill Benson: Were you able to observe Shabbat or any Jewish holidays at all at that
time?
>> Susan Taube: We had the synagogue in the ghetto. My mother used to go. | had
to work. There was no choice. If you had to work, you had to work. My mother, she
went. Yeah. Jewish life... we did have concerts, come to think of it. We did have
concerts. The Riga ghetto was actually two ghettos. One was for the Latvian Jews
and one for the German Jews. The Latvian Jews had artists in their group, and we
had concerts actually. And listened to it. For free.

>> Bill Benson: | think we're probably ready to close the program. | am going to turn
back to Susan to close our program, because it's our tradition at First Person that our
First Person has the last word. So | want to make sure we do that. First | want to
remind you we will have First Person programs each Wednesday and Thursday
through mid-August, so | hope that you will have an opportunity to return, and as |
mentioned earlier, the website has information about each of our upcoming First
Person programs. When Susan finishes, she's going to step off the stage and make
her way as quickly as possible, we hope, up the side and out. So let her get by if you
can, so she can get to the top of the stairs and sign copies of several books of
Herman's that are available. | hope you'll have a chance to chat with her there,
perhaps, ask a question and get a book.

Susan...
>> Susan Taube: Well, thank God I'm here, | survived. It was a terrible time. It should
never happen again. But reading the papers today, | think it's happening all around

the world. | have a beautiful family. | raised a beautiful family.

>> Bill Benson: You did.

teachers. CPA. Thank God for that.

And I'm here and | do the best | can. That's it.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Susan.
