There were no -- there was no way to do that. Then we had to go into hiding, and the factory closed because also the Germans took over. And they destroyed some of the machinery, and some of it became barracks for the troops. So there was no way the factory could operate. After the war it was in very bad shape, and there was no money to start it over, but somehow the bank gave us a loan, and we started, but with half or a quarter of the people, and the production was very limited. So it was kind of limping for a war - a while. Then, for several years it was a real, real struggle to -- to make it go. Material was difficult to get, and general the economic conditions were too bad. So finally the bank repossessed it, and that was the end of that factory. It became a warehouse for grain for the whole region, and now they have made it into technical schools. There\u2019s a gimna -- gimnasium, which is like a high school, and also technical schools for the rich. But the interesting thing 1s, they kept the facade, which was in -- 1t was, I mean architecturally it was a very -- it was the thing of the time. The roof was kind of slanted, and that they kept, but they also kept the name, and they call it Moudzoukos Technical Schools. There\u2019s also a bus stop called Moudzoukos stop."

I always thought of Athens as the magnificent city. So - but then when I realized that we were not coming back to Volos, it wasn\u2019t just a trip, I started thinking differently, and getting a little anxious. Not much was explained to me, and as a result of that, my imagination was wild. I would think all sorts of things, and of course, I couldn\u2019t discuss them, because it was like this is for the good of us, or this kind of thing.

There wasn\u2019t much we were doing as far as I was concerned. My only playmate was my cousin, who was I|1 years old -- I mean, 11 months older than me, and we were constant companions. I don\u2019t remember having friends, or being encouraged to -- to make friends. Since I didn\u2019t go to school, of course I couldn\u2019t meet other children. Then, in September of 1943, we went into hiding. And the events prior to this, I remember them very clearly. I had the mumps, and I was in bed, and the dining room was adjacent to the bedroom. So my -- all my aunts, and uncles came and they were having meetings with my parents in this dining room, and I could hear them whispering. I could not make out any words, but I knew something very serious was going on. And obviously they were planning where each one was going to go, what they were going to do, and it was like a big family meeting. My sister was in that -- in that meeting. Occasionally she would come out and check on me, to make sure I was all right, or put some hot pads on my cheeks, which was the normal treatment. And then she would go back in the room. And when I would ask what is it that -- why are you all in there, and she would say, \u201cWell, we - we just need to discuss some adult things.

He had baptized the oldest child, by the name of Many Babella, and he knew the family well. So he had talked to them, and they had agreed to take us. Of course, families could not -- families could not be together if there were more than two, three people, because they could be easily spotted, and they had to disperse. My father went to some other family, and my mother and I, and sister, went to Calivare, which is a suburb of Athens, to this wonderful family of a couple, the name was Pavella. And they had three children, a 15 year old, and one girl who was Kate, she was 10, as I was, and a younger boy about six or seven, called Dimitris. My mother, sister, and I shared one room. So the three of us shared one room, my father was elsewhere, and we had our meals with the family, I was playing with the children, who were about the same age as I was. I wasn\u2019t going to school, and my excuse was that I had appendicitis. And I wasn\u2019t supposed to go to school. This was what I was telling the children. Of course, they all wanted to see my incision, and there was no incision. Basically, I liked these kids, and they were just great, they were warm, and would play all sorts of games, and we had a great connection. My mother would communicate with my father once a week by telephone, and this was like a coded message. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

When the news was better, it was that, well, the patient is doing better. So, this was a pre-arranged kind of code for them to communicate. My sister became good friends with the sister of the woman who hid us, the family there. She had a bakery right across from where we were. And my sister would go there sometimes, and also Adhero will come to -- to the house. She was very warm, and caring, and often will bring cookies from the bakery."

Same thing for my mother and sister, we couldn\u2019t venture very far other than across the street to the bakery, because although we had left Volos, where we were very well known, and in Athens we were more -- more unknown people, it still the possibility that somebody would recognize us, and mention our names, and then everybody will be in great peril. Of course, the family that hid us was in danger by hiding us. These were wonderful people. He worked for -- the man of the family worked for a Greek newspaper, so he could bring home news of what was going on. His wife was also a very good housekeeper, caring for the children, and very nice, and my mother and Dasseia became friends. And even after the war they would see each other. And there was great respect for each other. So there was- there were good feelings there, and a good connection. As I said, we couldn\u2019t go out, we couldn\u2019t do things that we normally used to do.

I guess he had become very lonely in the family he was with in Athens, and he decided to come to be with us. Of course, this was with the agreement of the family we lived in. But shortly after, I remember it very clearly, one evening, Adhero, the -- the wife\u2019s sister, who had the bakery, came running to the house, and saying, \u201cYou must leave immediately. I heard from somebody that they know you are Jewish, and you are hiding.\u201d We used to tell, or the family used to tell that we were relatives, because sometimes we would be out in the yard, and people would ask, who are these people? They say they were relatives. And this man, who happened to be drunk, and he was in a tavern, in a Greek tavern, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t get fooled, these people are not relatives of the Pavella family, they are Jews, and they are hiding.\u201d So it was heard by everybody who was in that tavern, and Adhero happened to be there. And she ran and told us to leave immediately. Well, the first one who left was my father, because he was in greater danger. And he walked from Calivare to Athens with the man of the family, Milanos Pavella. He wouldn\u2019t let him go by himself. He took him on foot. And the next night, all three of us, my mother, my sister, and I, when it became dark, we also left with him. He came back, of course, after taking my father to a friend\u2019s house in Athens. He came back and took us to -- to Athens. Now this is about, I don\u2019t know, probably -- I remember walking for a long, long, long time in the night. I don\u2019t know exactly how far it is, but I\u2019m sure it must be like six miles, 10 miles from Athens. So it\u2019s a long walk for a 10 year old. And we had put scarfs on our heads, and tied them so people wouldn\u2019t recognize us immediately. So when we go to Athens, we immediately went where my father was, at the friend\u2019s house. Now these were very good friends, who were notified, apparently, when this incident of somebody saying that we were Jews occurred. And they were looking for a place for us to go. But until they found a place, we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So my sister went to a friend\u2019s house, one of her friends from Volos, that family lived in Athens, and they took her. And I went -- they took me to somebody\u2019s house in Athens, and all I remember, it was like a mansion, a huge place. And there lived a man in a wheelchair. I think he was an old man, but here again [indecipherable] wrong, being 10 years old -- and a woman who was taking care of him. I don\u2019t think she was a relative, I think she was a caretaker. And I was left there for 10 days by myself, not having communication with my family, not knowing what was going on, not knowing these people. I think this man didn\u2019t talk to me, or if he did, it must have been one or two words, or maybe he couldn\u2019t talk. I remember the woman feeding him, spoonfeeding him, so obviously he was pretty sick. And I was desperate. I was totally lost. I didn\u2019t know what happened to my parents, I didn\u2019t know if they would ever pick me up. But the woman, the caretaker of this man was a very kind woman, so when I would cry, she would try to comfort me, or tell me stories, or all sorts of things, just to make me feel good about it. Well, in about 10 days, my sister came, and she said, \u201cWe have a place now. I\u2019m ga -- I\u2019m here to pick you up, to take you.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she had called before or not, I don\u2019t recall. But I took my little satchel of things, a couple of changes of clothe -- clothes, and my doll, and said good-bye and left. And we went -- we met again at this friend\u2019s house, and we went, I think in installments again, my father went first, or we went first, to the second house, where we spent about seven months. This was in Kipserly. It was the family of Andonis Vayas, who was an officer in the navy. And they had -- he and his wife had the little girl about three years old. And I think there was a grandmother who was deaf, and also lived in the house, but we hardly saw her. She stayed in her room for the most time. Anyway, so it was a new adjustment. We had a very large room for the four of us, so there was like a -- a screen put in the middle, so on one side where my parents were sleeping, and on the other side was my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We were sharing the other side of the room. And we were closer to the street, it was on a street level, and closer to the street. I slept on a cot. And I remember at night I would hear the Germans patrolling, and I could hear their boots going by my window. And I would stop breathing. I was so petrified, because I thought they were coming for us. And I would pull the blanket over my head, and stop breathing, I -- until I couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t do it any more, and I had to breathe. So then slowly I will pull the blanket off my head, and I would listen very carefully, and by then the steps with the boots -- because I knew -- I knew they were boots, would disa -- have disappeared, or they would have gone away, or they were far, so I knew we were safe. This was my biggest fear, that they would come and get us. Here again, I didn\u2019t go to school. My father tried to teach me some arithmetic, and I think I had two books, \u201cRobinson Crusoe,\u201d and another one, which was a rather gloomy book called, \u201cThe Orphans of Scotland.\u201d And it was nothing but -- you know, five orphans, or maybe more, whose father was in prison, and how they got him out of prison in a basket, and things like that. But it was a rather sad book, if I remember correctly. Then I got hold of a children\u2019s magazine heyou -- I think it was a weekly magazine. I don\u2019t know who gave it to us, or how I got hold of it, and it had wonderful stories, and this was very nice for me too, to read. Other than that, think my imagination went wild, because I used to play in the backyard, and all I would do 1s pick up bamboo stick, and pretend it was a gun, and was shooting all the Germans. And we were free, I thought, by me doing that. Games like this. Occasional I will play with a three year old little girl. But that was about it. The backyard had a fence, and the next house was also a two story house, I think, and in the balcony there was a little girl who would be out practically every day, and playing with dolls, and other toys. And I would go next to the fence, and we started talking. And she would always invite me to go to her house to play. But of course, I knew I couldn\u2019t, so I would find all sorts of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But one time I couldn\u2019t bear it any more, so I jumped the fence. On our side of the yard, the fence was reasonably manageable, I could go over it. But when I jumped, it was very high on her side. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t break a leg. So I jumped the fence, and went to her apartment and played there for awhile. Of course, nobody in my family knew that I left the house. But when it was time for me to go back, I just couldn\u2019t climb the fence, it was too much. So finally I decided I had to go around the corner, because this house was around the corner. So I came, and rang the doorbell, and of course the woman opened the door, and she was SO surprised to see me. And my mother came, and she was absolutely pale when she saw me. I got a good spanking for that, I remember. I wasn\u2019t supposed to -- to leave the house, especially not telling anybody. But it was that urge to be with other children, to be able to play, to be -- to have a normal life like any other child that made me do that."

And one day they burst in, pretending they were people from the power company, and they wanted to read the meter, but they came in with guns, and they were asking for Moudzoukos.

The chores were like sitting -- setting the table, or things like that. We all had dinner together, we all ate together. I think the cooking was done by my mother, and by Desseia. Desseia would do the shopping, or sometimes Milanos, the father, would do the shopping. And they would take turns cooking. And as far as cleaning, I think we were responsible for cleaning our room, making our beds, doing the laundry, or setting it out, I don\u2019t remember, in those days you were just washing, you know, by hand. So I think things were divided that way. For me, I remember I would wait impatiently until the children will come home from school, because that was the fun time I could play with. During the day my mother tried to engage me in teaching me how to embroider, or how to sew, and I had no interest whatsoever in any of these sedentary activities. Plus my eyes were not very good, so I couldn\u2019t concentrate on a little hole there for hours. I -- I -- I may have had one or two books, but basically I think I had a vivid imagination and I would make up stories. And when the children will come, I will tell them stories, or they will tell me jokes, and this kind of thing. We didn\u2019t go out, but yet had a huge yard, and that was nice, because we could play outside."

            "answer": "Right. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sure it was very difficult for my mother, first of all because my father was elsewhere, and for my sister, because she was older, and she could understand the dangers, and whatever was going on. So, since I didn\u2019t know that much about what was going on in the world, you know, I wasn\u2019t particularly worried. I was worried about my father, and I wanted my father to be with us, and I was told he eventually will be with us, but that was about it. I -- I didn\u2019t feel deprived, although, you know, food was not really -- it was difficult to get food. So I remember some of the dishes, it was like cabbage with rice, and carrots. And to this day I make it, and I think exactly of -- of that time. I loved it, it was great dish. You know, I mean, meat, eggs, fish probably were not available that much, and they were expensive. So, you know, when you have a large family to feed, it\u2019s considerable. But yes, it wasn\u2019t a painful time for me. It was more of a -- of an interesting time, or a fun time, I would think. But the other two places we went, it was a more painful time, because number one, I lost the children, you know, I -- I didn\u2019t have my friends any more. So that was a big loss when we left.

We -- I think in about a week my parents were able to rent an apartment in Athens, and friends lent us furniture, like folding cots, and folding tables, and folding chairs, and mattresses. I slept on a mattress. I remember there was only one bed where my grandmother, when she came from her hiding place, slept. Everybody else slept in cots, or on a mattress on the floor. And we were reunited with my grandmother, my Aunt Julia, and Raymond my -- my cousin. But his father was taken to Bergen-Belsen, so he wasn\u2019t with them. He eventually returned to Greece."

And after that, you had to pass exams again, because all social workers were employed basically by the ministry of social welfare. So there were a lot of people who were welfare workers, and were going to villages, distributing welfare checks, and taking care of these type of things. There were social workers who were working in a hospital, sort -- other kind of agencies, there were no private agencies that would hire social workers. So I worked in a -- in a hospital at the beginning at the children\u2019s hospital, and later in a public hospital as a discharge social worker, discharging people, and making arrangements for them. And then I met Isaac. Oh, before I met Isaac I also belonged to a little Jewish club. It was a Jewish youth club where I met Sam. Sam is Isaac\u2019s brother. And we became very good friends, both with Sam and his then fianc\u00e9e, Evelyn. And we were a group of about, you know, we were groups, several groups. We used to go on excursions, or places, different -- to the movies together, but we moved in the group. So I was dating at the time a young man, who was part of that Jewish club, and this was a nice time. I think the adults were very pleased that we had this club, and I think partially they financed it, because they wanted all the young people to meet other Jewish people. And in some cases it worked very well, because quite a few of these people married, you know, other women, men, that belonged to this club, and that\u2019s how they met."

And that was very nice. So to get back to your question, when did we make plans. I think it was understood that I would come to United States. At that time, I was applying for a scholarship to come to the United States to study. And I had applied to Barnard College, and I forget what else. But I had a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And Isaac told me that if I come as a student, I cannot stay in the United States. So we went to the American consulate to get some advice, and they told us that indeed, I could not -- I could get the scholarship, but I -- even -- I couldn\u2019t get married in the United States and remain in the United States. The Greek visa was oversubscribed. So I think 1t was something like 10 years of waiting, or something like that, which didn\u2019t thrill me. And one of the suggestions was that maybe I can go to Canada, and get married in Canada, and then for Isaac to apply for me to come from Canada to the United States as a spouse. Because Canada had no - no quota. So we thought about it, and thought about it, a-and we thought it might be a good idea. My -- there was a family that we knew who had gone to Montreal. This was my brother-in-law\u2019s- Yola\u2019s husband\u2019s cousin. And they had moved from Athens to Montreal like maybe two years before that. So Freddie, my brother-in-law, wrote to them and told them the situation, and asked them if I could stay with them while all the paperwork was being done. And they said they would be very glad to have me there. So that\u2019s what happened. A friend my sister\u2019s, who was working for HIAS, the Hebrew Immigration Society, said to me, \u201cYou know we are going to speed things up for you. Why don\u2019t you get your police report, your health records, and everything else you need, and we\u2019|l send them to the consulate in Montreal. So after you marry, the -- all your -- all that your husband has to do,\u201d-- [indecipherable], \u201call that your husband has to do is to -- to apply for you to come to United States, and this will save you a lot of paperwork over there.\u201d I said fine. So I did all this preliminary work, and Linda sent everything to Montreal. So I left in April of \u201958 for Montreal. It was -- didn\u2019t hit me until I was on the plane, and I said to myself, where am I going, all by myself, to somebody I don\u2019t really know. I just wanted the plane to come back. But the plane kept going. And eventually I re -- I reached Montreal, my friends were there to greet me at the airport.

And I think shortly after that he dis -- his divorce papers came through. And we went again to Toronto, and we got married by a Justice of Peace. I was all dressed up, not in a wedding gown, but in a very fancy, elegant dress that\u2019s -- my parents made me at a very great attag -- couturier, as we used to call it, in Athens. And the question was, do I wear a hat, or do I not wear a hat. And Isaac said, \u201cIf you wear a hat, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So I thought well, okay. So we were just the two of us, there was nobody, and you had to have witnesses for the wedding. So we -- they told us that we can go out 1n the waiting room and ask two people to come inside and become our witnesses, or go to Eton, we -- which the department store across the street, and [indecipherable] everybody will come, you\u2019re two young people in love, you know, people love stories like this. Anyway, at the waiting room there was another couple. It was an older couple -- I mean, older, I would think probably in their 50\u2019s. And they were going to get married also. So we made an agreement, we would sign -- we would be witnesses at their wedding, and they would be the witnesses in our wedding. And that\u2019s what happened. I had to repeat in English, and my English wasn\u2019t that good at the time, you know, that\u2019s -- I do marry him, and take care of him, for better or worse. And that was it. At the time - the more I think about that now, the more I think how I missed my family not being there, and not having anybody. And many times I go to weddings, and I cry my heart out. And I wanted my daughters to have nice weddings, with lots of people, and friends, and family. Because I feel that I just -- was a big loss for me not to have anybody. But on the other hand, at the time, I -- all I wanted was to get married to Isaac. And to me, that was because there were a few obstacles, as I said, to -- to bypass the immigration laws, to -- to come -- I mean to -- for him to get the divorce papers, and all this kind of stuff. So these were like little setbacks that kept me wondering would I ever be able to marry this man. And that\u2019s all I wanted at the time, but there was some feeling of not having the people that mattered most in something so important in my life."

I wasn\u2019t happy at all. The family I lived with, as I told you, had two children, so in order for me to be busy and think less of Isaac, Sonia gave me full care of the baby. He was about six or seven months old, little Eddie. So she would say to me, \u201cYou need to practice, you take care of him.\u201d And I would say, \u201cWell, P\u2019ve never take care of a baby, what do I do?\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out. Just don\u2019t let him fall.\u201d And I was taking care of him completely. I would take him for walks, I would take him out. We\u2019d play together. It was wonderful to -- to have a little baby there. Anyway, meantime -- it takes a long time -- Isaac applied for me to come to the United States as a spouse. And at some point he said to me, \u201cYou know, you have to go to the consulate and tell them that  find out why is it taking so long.\u201d Well, it was taking longer than we thought, and eventually I went to the HIAS office, to the Hebrew Immigration Society, and saw a social worker there, who got interested in the whole thing, and she made several attempts to find out what was going on, and I think eventually what happened is Isaac had applied for me to come to the United States by the name of Nehama, as his spouse. The papers that were sent from Greece, by HIAS were under the name Moudzoukos. So the two things were never put together, Moudzoukos and Nehama were two different persons for them. So they never figured it out. It was only after desperation that Isaac went to his congressman in New Jersey where he lived, and talked to him, and the next day I get a phone call from this social worker, and she said, \u201cGuess what? You\u2019re going tomorrow. We have everything ready for you, the visa is ready, come to the office.\u201d And of course, it was wonderful, because it had become to be a big, big problem, you know, six months- it was six months it took for me being by myself there -- I mean, it wasn\u2019t by myself, but still, I was very anxious to start my life, and for Isaac to be in the United States. So, in November, first day 1t snowed in Canada when I was there, I said good-bye to my friends, and boarded a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I would think, my God, if I get lost, how am I gonna say where I live? I mean, this is not the place to take me. You should take me someplace where I can pronounce, or I can even say it. So it was -- the house was all taken care of. I mean, he had arranged it, and fixed it, and he had a lot of his furniture there, but decorated very nicely, painted it, just took good care of things. And then it was, how do I live here, and what do I do, and it was a bit hard. It was lonely, because I didn\u2019t know anybody, although I met two good friends of his, and their wives were marvelous. They would come and pick me up and take me to lunch, or take me places, and they tried very hard to -- to make me feel comfortable. But a couple of months later, I -- oh no, I started going to New York, I would take the bus from New Jersey and go to New York in the day time, and started going to the museums, and just getting a feel of the city, and I loved it. And one day, I think Isaac had gone to San Francisco on business, I was looking in the newspaper, and I saw that there was a position open for a social worker that -- to deal with adoptions. So I called, and made an appointment, and took the bus, and went to -- and indeed, it was the International Social Service in New York, that was looking for a social worker, take care of Greek adoptions. I knew all the social workers in the International Social Service in Greece -- I no -- in Athens. I knew them very well. And to me this was like a glove that fitted perfectly well. So I told them I was interested in the job, they said they thought I would be perfect for the job, but they have to communicate with the people in Athens, and get references from there, and everything else, which they did, and then they called me, and they said, \u201cMy goodness, I mean we never heard anything as good as this. When can you start?\u201d So I got the job, and I had to commute, of course, every day from New Jersey. It would take me like an hour almost, on the bus.

And I liked the people work there, very well, very much. Then I got pregnant with Sarah, and commuting wasn\u2019t the best thing for me. I had the threatening miscarriage, and the doctor said to me, \u201cWell, all I can tell you is, what you want, the baby or the wor -- the job?\u201d So I decided I wanted the baby, and that meant I had to stop working. There was no other way to get to New York early in the morning, so I stopped working. And I was sad about that, because I just felt I had reached the point where now I\u2019m able to -- to live in the United States, to work, to become part of it. So it was a bit sad. But of course, having a baby was wonderful."

I can\u2019t make it to the bathroom, I can\u2019t -- so I called Isaac, and I said to him, \u201cThrow me a towel, I\u2019m having a baby.\u201d So Isaac took the towel -- I had taken a shower at ni -- the night before, and threw me the towel -- gave me the towel, and he was in a total panic. So he looks out of the window, and he sees my neighbor and good friend, and psychiatrist, Dr. Julius Hoffman walking his dog, and reading his paper. So he opens the door, and he calls Dr. Hoffman, and he said, \u201cJules, Jules, Paulette is having a baby, what do I do?\u201d So he run to his house, which was next door, left the dog, came in -- I don\u2019t know if he washed his hands, but came in and the moment he came in, the baby was halfway out. So he delivered the baby, and he told me it was a girl. I heard her cry once. And Isaac called an ambulance -- oh no, he called the doctor, the doctor said, \u201cMy goodness,\u201d you know, \u201cwhen did that happen? Bring her to the hospital. Call an -- an ambulance and bring to the hospital immediately, I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d So meantime, when Dr. Hoffman took his dog back, he told his wife, \u201cPaulette is having a baby.\u201d So she was alerted, and she came. And I had called another neighbor, who had told me she would take care of the girls, and when I said to her, you know, \u201cI-I\u2019m in labor, and I\u2019Il go to the hospital, do you think you can This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So the two women are here, and Dr. Hoffman, and the ambulance came. The -- of course, you know, they check the baby, and me. They put me on the ambulance. And as we are going out the door, all of a sudden I said, \u201cWhat happened to Sarah and Maya? Tell them to come here and see their new sister.\u201d Isaac had forgotten about them. He shoved them in her room, and she -- he said to him, \u201cStay there, and don\u2019t move.\u201d So when he opened the door to see the two, to tell them to come out, both of them were huddled one next to the other, sucking their thumbs, poor things. I mean, they were -- so m -- I asked to see them, so they came as I was going out the door on the stretcher. I told them I was fine, and they looked at the baby. And I told them that my neighbors, Mrs. Hoffman, and Mrs. Grossman\u2019s going to take care of them. Daddy would be back, I\u2019d be back in a couple of days, and I'll talk to them on the phone. So off we go, an -- in the ambulance, and I don\u2019t hear the baby crying, so I think she\u2019s dead. I was very worried. So I kept telling Dr. Hoffman, \u201cI can\u2019t hear the baby cry.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou want me to pinch her? She will cry.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t do that, but is she alive, or is she not?\u201d \u201cYes, she\u2019s alive, she\u2019s breathing all right.\u201d So I go to the hospital, the doctor meets me right there at the entrance, he takes me down [indecipherable] emergency room. He checks me out, he says, \u201cMrs. Nehama, you are 1n perfect health. It\u2019s Mr. Nehama who needs to be hospitalized.\u201d Isaac was in the ambulance with Dr. Hoffman, and he was holding the baby, wrapped in a yellow sha -- the yellow towel. We have that towel, I gave it to Nicole. But then I couldn\u2019t see the baby, because they put her in isolation, in the intensive care, just to check her out. And I thought she was dead. So I keep asking, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I want to get up to see the baby.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t let me get up, although I was fine. Well, finally in the afternoon they let me get up, and I went by the nursery and there\u2019s a woman who is sitting there -- standing there in front of the big window, and she said to me, \u201cDid you have a baby today?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, how about you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cI had it at home.\u201d I said, \u201cI did, too. Have you seen your baby?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think my baby\u2019s over there.\u201d And then I looked, and the nurse brought Nicole, or I pointed, and she brought her, you know, from the window, and somebod -- then in the evening I had her, and she came to the room, they brought her. But it was a little worrisome, not being able to see her. So those days you stayed in the hospital about five days. So everything went well, thank God she was fine. Last day of discharge the doctor got us, all the women, all his patients were about to be discharged, and he gives them instructions what to do, and what not to do. So he introduces every single woman around this -- around the room, and he said, \u201cAnd this is Mrs. Nehama, who sneezed and had her baby on Saturday.\u201d He used to call me the do-it-yourself girl. He was funny. But then I heard all sorts of stories. I was at the grocery store one day, and I wrote a check, and the cashier said to me, \u201cThank you, Mrs. Nehama.\u201d And the woman behind me, she said, \u201cAre you Mrs. Nehama?\u201d\u2019 I looked at her, I didn\u2019t know her. I said yes. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re the woman who scared my husband to death.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know your husband, who is he?\u201d Well, she says, \u201cYou don\u2019t know him, but you scared him to death.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d She said, \u201cDi -- didn\u2019t you have your baby at home?\u201d I said yeah. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you had the baby, I was seven months pregnant, and my husband wouldn\u2019t let me get out of the house for two months. He would call me every half hour. He was so scared I would have the baby in the house. You changed my life.\u201d So, there were funny things. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Now I regret that. I hoped -- o-or I wished that things were different, and my attitude would have been different. And -- but it\u2019s a little too late, I mean, for me anyway, to teach them. But certainly they did get some religious things from -- celebrating the holidays here, the high holidays, and things like that. On high holidays we would go to the synagogue. But I don\u2019t think 1t was enough, I really don\u2019t. But I had areal fear at the time, of being identified a Jew, although I knew it was almost like being a kryptal Jew, because I would never deny that I was Jewish, or -- or I was married to a Jew, but there was a lot of anxiety about that, until I finally realized the Nazis are gone, you know, you have nothing to be afraid of at this point."

And I remember once, after I had sewn a badge on her- most of these badges would say Jewish Federation, or Jewish this, or Jewish that. They had the Star of David. So they were definitely very Jewish badges. She was going to go out with a friend to the mall to buy a present for another friend who had a birthday. So the mother of the other friend was going to drive them there, and pick them up. And it was a cool day, and Maya is ready to go, the car is waiting in my driveway, and she\u2019s wearing this jacket. And I said to her, \u201cMaya, you cannot wear this jacket.\u201d It was full of badges. And she said, \u201cWhy? It\u2019s cold out.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, Maya, you have to put a different jacket.\u201d And I literally sta -- stood in front of the door, because I wanted her to go change her jacket. My feeling was that how can she go to a public place, and be seen as being a Jew? I had this feeling that she would be lynched, that people will say horrible things, that people will do harm to her. And that was unbearable to me, that my child will be hurt because she was Jewish. But basically, what that was saying 1s, I was Jewish, and I was hurt because of that, when I was a kid. So that was very difficult. Of course, once I realized what I was doing, I let her go. But she could not understand it at the time. I explained to her later, when she came back. But I remember s -- having this fear. I actually saw her being hurt. And that was unbearable."

I was in small rooms, but not in an attic. \u201cAnd -- and some people really hid you, and you couldn\u2019t go out, you couldn\u2019t go to school, and that must have been real nice.\u201d He really liked the fact I didn\u2019t go to school.

You\u2019re going to be 49 whether you get it or not.\u201d And I never forgot that. And I thought, if I lived in Greece, and I was 49, there wouldn\u2019t have been a place for me to go and get a degree, even if I wanted to. Even when I was talking to my friends in Greece, and I would tell them I\u2019m going to college to get a Master\u2019s degree, they would think I was sort of well, maybe she\u2019s a little cuckoo at this late age, you know.

And every time he reads them, you know, I get a chill in my back. It just -- just, you know, brings tears to my eyes. And I remember my father reading -- not Ladeeno, but you know, presiding over the Seder, and I know the last time I saw him it was Passover, because he was sick, and I had gone to Greece, I had taken Nicole with me, who was about three.

I want to live to see my grandchild.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou will live to see this grandchild, and many more to come.\u201d And that was such a nice thing to say. I remember when I was doing -- I was in radiation therapy, and it was very close to Maya\u2019s delivery, I would s - asked the rad -- the -- the doctor there, the radiologist, \u201cCan I take time off when my daughter has her baby?\u201d And for the moment she thought it was an out of town daughter, so she would say to me, \u201cI can\u2019t let you stop radiation. It doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to be here every single day except the weekend. If your daughter has the baby the weekend, you\u2019re gonna be lucky.\u201d So finally I told her that my daughter lived here, and I had to be there. And she said to me, \u201cWe will make every effort. We will schedule you for six o\u2019clock in the morning. We will schedule you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Yeah. Now I return to Greece every year. My sister lives there, and I have lots of friends, and a nephew, and now he is a father, and about to become a second time father. So my friends date from the Girl Scout days, from high school. And I have two wonderful teachers that are probably in their late 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s that I see. And every time I see them, it\u2019s such a warm reception. Last year I was in Greece, and they invited me to have coffee at a little coffee shop, two of them and a- another good friend, who was also in the same school I was, but she was also in the Girl Scouts with me. So actually she\u2019s the first one I call when I go to Greece. And we were talking about all sorts of things, and then I said to them, \u201cHow do you remember me from my school days?\u201d You know, I was 15 - 16. And it was such a warm feeling for them to talk about me, that they thought I was a very sensitive child. I -- I had a lot of humanity, one of them said it. And that this was very apparent. They both knew I had survived the Holocaust. Although I wasn\u2019t terribly good student, I was good student in some of the -- in their class I was a good student. One taught -- taught history, and the other taught psychology. So I was very good in both classes. I wasn\u2019t good in math. So, I mean such encouragement that I was really a worthwhile person when I was there. And I kind of needed that, to hear it, that what was then, what is now. Because sometimes there\u2019s such a big gap between this ocean. And then the one who is a historian, she sent me a Christmas card, and she said how happy she was to see me in Greece, and that she always remembers me with great affection. And that what she remembers is, here again, my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She wasn\u2019t happy I left the house to go and do these kind of things, but it was something I remember with great fondness. Unfortunate, she doesn\u2019t remember it now.

So he notified them, and from there they called this general, who came to -- there was a market, a big market near the house we were staying in Kipserly, and he went to that market, so he could see the house.

And my mother would help with the cooking, or she will do the cooking, the woman will do the shopping. So my mother was a little more busy than my father. Now you asked me before how I would pass my day. I remember my mother tried to teach me how to embroid, and my mother was excellent in embroiding. She has done beautiful pieces, and I have some of her pieces, which I treasure. But I just didn\u2019t have the patience to do that. I mean, I couldn\u2019t sit quiet, and just trying to put a little -- my needle in the little hole there, and get pleasure out of it. It was the most boring thing for me.

So these things didn\u2019t really attract me, or just, you know, give me any particular pleasure in doing.

Sarah was a very feisty baby, very, very light, very small baby, but my goodness. A friend of mine who had her baby with Sarah, we put them both in a playpen. She said to me, \u201cI thought my child was retarded compared to yours.\u201d Cause she was moving, she was in constant move and action. And she was just great, and I think that did a lot of good to her to -- to have her there. But then we left, we came back to United States, so here she was left empty handed again. So that was hard for her. And she freaked out when I -- I said to my mother, \u201cI\u2019m going to send a case of Gerber baby food for Sarah when I come.\u201d And she said, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to feed your child food from the can, or from a jar? Is that what you do in the United States? We never did things like that.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, everybody here uses this kind of food for babies.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you come here, we\u2019re gonna cook for the baby.

Greece 1s not a -- a place where people, you know, understand these kind of things. Certainly nobody in the family understood the enormity of it. I think she did see a doctor, who maybe put her on antidepressants or something, but that was shortly before she died. So, it was not a long therapy before that. You know, she just didn\u2019t have -- she had lost the -- the zest for life. Everything seemed to be just enormous for her, even if I would say, well, can my friends stay for dinner, and this was a friend she knew, and somebody, you know, she didn\u2019t have to particularly make something special, it seemed like it was too much for her.

And somebody told me about the Jewish Social Service in Rockville, that they were looking for a social worker at the department of aging, I think. And I called, and verified that indeed they did need somebody, asked me to send my resume, which I did, and they called me back, they wanted me to go for an interview, which was terrific. Well, I did go to the interview, but I went a day earlier than the interview was scheduled, like I was not anxious, I guess.

So anyway, the assistant director who was to interview me, Marty Moss was his name, he -- he said to me, \u201cI thought this interview was tomorrow, but anyway since you\u2019re here, I have 10 minutes because I have to go into a meeting. Let\u2019s just discuss a few minutes of what is available, and what you can do [indecipherable].

Now, I know nothing about aging. I\u2019ve never worked with older people, I don\u2019t know what to do with them. I want to work with children. Anyway, I said okay. And then I get a call from the chairperson of the Department of Aging to go for a second interview. And I\u2019m thinking, do I really want to work with older people? I\u2019m not sure. But anyway, it was an entrance. So I think the question that really, she asked me, was -- I had done some volunteer work for the Jewish Community Center, we were doing some kind of a woman\u2019s day, and I had chosen the older women, and I had done, you know, some -- a presentation about it, and gathered material, and we had the show, a -- a fashion show for older women, you know, because we felt they were neglected in the fashion, things like that.

If I don\u2019t like it, I can always leave. So that was how I started, and once I started working with older people, I just loved it. I found it so rewarding. You know, here I was, always wanted to work with children, and now I\u2019m finding the other end of life more interesting, actually, and very rewarding. So it was great, it was a great team to work with. It was a good a -- very good agency, very good camaraderie and professionalism. And I enjoy every minute of it, and I stayed there. I think I started in \u201974, and stayed until 1990. That\u2019s a long time. And while I was working there -- I always wanted to do therapy, and I had taken some courses, and then while I was at the Jewish Social Service, the -- my department chair said, \u201cPaulette, you've got to get your Master\u2019s degree. You are doing things that Master\u2019s degree social workers are doing, but we can\u2019t pay you as a Master\u2019s degree social worker.\u201d So finally I thought about it, and thought about it, and I\u2019ve never been to an American university, I was 49 years old. So when I told a friend, I said, \u201cI\u2019m 49, how am I gonna go to school?\u201d She said, \u201cYou'll be 49 whether you go or not, just go.\u201d So finally I talked it over with Isaac, I said I would need a lot of help. This was a time that Maya had started driving, and she said, \u201cI'll help, I'll help, I'll do all your [indecipherable] driving for you.\u201d So everybody pitched in and I did go to school. They accepted me as an advanced standing student because of my experience with social work. They waived ce -- certain courses the first semester, and they waived field placement the first semester, because I was still working for the Jewish Social Service part time. So my first year was much lighter than the other students here. Second year was harder, I had to -- to quit working for the Jewish Social Service, because I couldn\u2019t handle everything, because I did have a field placement, and I had an excellent supervisor. It was in a psychiatric clinic, a community This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I got excellent experience, I had a wonderful supervisor, Meedul Shore. And of course I had the classes, you know, I had to go to school, and plus the family. Sarah was already in college, Maya and Nicole were home. So it was hard writing papers, I\u2019ve never written a paper in this country. I mean, I\u2019ve written papers in Greece, but they were different. It was a little hard, because as I said, this was a new experience for me. I didn\u2019t even know how to use the library. I had to ask how to use the library. It was a lot of work, an awful lot of work, but I loved every minute of it, because I felt I was doing it because I wanted to do it. And I graduated with a Master\u2019s in 1991. And I went back to the Jewish Social Service, and -- but at the time they had a part time job only available, and they said, \u201cCome, it\u2019s part time, if something opens as full time, we\u2019ll get you as full time.\u201d"

Are you interested?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m interested, but I\u2019m not leaving Jewish Social Service.\u201d So he says, \u201cT\u2019ll have him call you.\u201d So he calls me, and he says he\u2019s looking for a social worker to do his intakes.

It was one of Isaac\u2019s retreats. So I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m leaving for a week.\u201d He said, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Seniors. Yeah, this is volunteer work. I mean, my work for the Aging Network Services is - is paid work. I\u2019m a member of WPAS, or Washington Performing Arts Society, the women\u2019s committee, and the women\u2019s committee has several subcommittees. And one of the committees I co-chair with another woman, is called Enriching Experiences for Seniors, that started about 10 or 12 years ago. And what we do 1s we bring local artists to senior centers, nursing homes, assisted livings, recreation centers for senior adults. What we do is just we coordinate these things. You have to coordinate the center, find the activities director, the date, coordinate the artist, and the days they are available to do this kind of things. And also provide the volunteers from the women\u2019s committee who go to audit the performance, because this way they give us feedback on the artists and the interaction between the -- all the people and the artists, so we\u2019 ll know whether to hire them for next year or not. This 1s a free program to the community -- I mean, the seniors don\u2019t pay anything for this. WPAS has a budget for the senior program. And that\u2019s what I do in addition to working for the gala, which is a [indecipherable] event, fundraising event, or the auction, or the embassy adoption program, which 1s another women\u2019s committee program, where embassies adopt school, and the -- for the semester, or for the year, and the children study about that particular country. And I usually choose Greece. So the children -- the school that chooses Greece, and the embassy, I\u2019m the liaison between the two of them. So we go -- the representative for the Greek embassy, or the other embassies go to the school, talk to the children about it. The children study about Greece, and work with the teachers, we work with the teachers, and then at the end of the semester, they put up a presentation, the embassy invites them for -- for cookies and juice, or whatever. And they give a presentation to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then we take the children to a Greek restaurant, so they can taste a little food. These are sixth graders, they are 12 years old, and they are wonderful. This -- I mean, 50 embassies participate in this -- in this program, and it\u2019s a fantastic program for teachers and children. The teachers love this program because the children learn so much through that program about the other countries. And it\u2019s very educational, it\u2019s a fun program, it\u2019s just great. So I love doing Greece, as you understand. Last year there were - the Greek embassy was between ambassadors, so they didn\u2019t have time to participate in the program, so they were not there. So I did the embassy of the Bahamas, which was also a nice experience, you know, and I went to a school pretty far away in someplace -- I think it was northeast Washington. And the wife of the ambassador came to the school, they had -- they invited the children to their embassy of the Bahamas. They had the presentation, they provided lunch at the embassy, from the whole class. It was a good experience. I mean, to -- to - somehow I feel that, you know, just doing Greece every year kind of limits me to other countries, because people tell me wonderful things about the embassy of Israel, you know, and Thailand or other countries. But I love Greece, so Pll do anything to promote Greece, and to -- and teach children about it. There is so much. And next year it\u2019s going to be an important year because of the Olympics, so -"

My mother volunteered, there was a Jewish organization in Volos, a women\u2019s organization, she volunteered that -- there. She volunteered at the orphanage in Volos. There was an orphan -- not a Jewish orphanage, an orphanage in Volos, and sometimes she would take me with her. And I loved going with her, and talking with the children there, but I was also petrified that if my mother and father were to die, I would end up in that orphanage. I was so scared of that, of them dying and me being in the orphanage. And I remember when I had this visit in Volos, when it was like the 50 year reunion I was telling you, Yola and I had taken a taxi to go to the Jewish cemetery, because our grandparents are buried there.

            "answer": "Okay. As I told you, my parents were first cousins, so my father was the second child, and first son. There were five children in his family. His mother was the eldest of seven children. My grandparents had seven children, two girls. First one, my paternal grandmother, last one my maternal grandmother, and there were boys in between. So there were five children in my father\u2019s family. Abusta was the eldest, my father was the second, there were two girls, and Saould, or Sauld was the youngest, who was born in 19 -- I think he was born 1909, or 1910. So he was like an afterthought. He was much younger compared to the other siblings in the family. Well, none of them are alive. They all went to hiding in different places. My fourth aunt, the fourth child in the family was the only one who survived until 1976, I think. She came to the United States. She was adopted by an uncle, the brother of -- of her mother, who was married, and they couldn\u2019t have any children. So Connie used to go to their house, and they had her there, and they played with her, and they loved her, they absolutely were in love with her. And they decided to come -- to go to Teriester first. So they asked if they could take her along. And they did, and then they decided they wanted to come to the United States. I mean, the uncle, and his wife. So they went back to Greece, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an official adoption, whether there were papers of adoption taken. But somehow it seems like the family, or the parents, anyway, decided to -- to let her go with the uncle, because they felt she will have a wonderful life in the United States, and not in Volos. So she came to the United States, and she didn\u2019t know she was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

She was an adult, I think, when she found out about that. She got married, and had a son, whom I see, Bob Guburbon. My aunt died in, I think, \u201970 -- let me see, no, she must have died in \u201976 or \u201977, yeah, in Florida. And her husband died a few years later. I see her grand -- h-her son, often. This aunt, Connie, send us care packages after the war was over, with food, with clothes. She would send fancy party clothes for me, and they looked so funny, because you know, I mean, here I didn\u2019t have any clothes, and I had a -- an organza dress, old dress. And she would send some cans, I mean, chocolates. And she once sent shoes for my father. I remember they were so huge. I mean, my father was a tall and big man, and these shoes were tremendous for him. I mean, he couldn\u2019t wear them. And she sended a teddy bear for me. So I always remember her, you know, for doing these things. Of course, I met her when I came to the United States. But I mean, she had never met her siblings. She was in touch with them. I don\u2019t know if she was in touch with them before the war, but after the war, I mean, she came through with sending care packages. And then, of course, they were corresponding with -- \u2018scuse me -- with my father, and he was the one who would tell the news, you know, t-to -- to his sisters. And my Aunt Julia corresponded with her, because Julia had come to the United States to visit her son who was studying, and has seen Connie. Now, my father\u2019s younger brother, Saul was hiding in somebody\u2019s house, I think the name was aseema -- Aseemomeetees. And there were two daughters and a son, maybe two sons. And he fell in love with the oldest daughter, and she with him. Saul was a handsome, beautiful man. And after the war was over, they kept on seeing each other, and dating each other, and they wanted to get married, but of course she was Christian Orthodox, and the rabbi wouldn\u2019t marry them, she had to convert. So she took all the lessons that she needed to do to convert. But then there was a little detail which I don\u2019t remember now, and they decided they were gonna go to France, and get married in Paris. So This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  134 they did go to Paris and got married, and came back to live in Athens. And she knew more about Jewish holidays than any of us did. My mother didn\u2019t know them, and she would call -- Deena, was her name. Deena would call my mother and say, \u201cDo you know that today is,\u201d such and such a holiday. My mother would say, \u201cOh, really?\u201d I mean, we observed the big holidays, but not the little ones. And Deena knew everything. And -- but unfortunately, a few months later, in 1950 - I think they married \u00b049, or beginning of \u201950 -- or \u201951 I think it was, he got cancer, a brain tumor. And they went to Paris and he had surgery and died. It was terrible. It was devastating. He was or 41, very young. A life, you know, just got done so young. And of course Deena was totally, totally devastated. Now, many years later she remarried, but she divorced, this marriage didn\u2019t go that well. Then many years later she married somebody who was living in the United States, in Florida, so -- a -- a -- a Greek, but I think he -- he was Greek American, or someth like that, and he went -- they -- they lived in Florida. She couldn\u2019t stand it, she didn\u2019t like Florida, she didn\u2019t like America. So she divorced him too, and she went back to Greece, and now she -- she lives alone. When I go to Greece she comes and sees me. She -- she is very warm, very lovely. I went to -- to volunteer nursing school at the Red Cross in Greece with her sister, her younger sister. So we were both volunteer nurses at the Red Cross hospital, and we took the classes together. So I haven\u2019t seen her sister for a long time, but Deena, she was a lovely, lovely woman, yeah."
