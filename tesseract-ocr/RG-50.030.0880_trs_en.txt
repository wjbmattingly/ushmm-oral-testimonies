A: My mother was born in Forst. That’s a little town near the Polish border now.
And my father was born in Karlsruhe, near the Rhine river. And Hilde(ph) was an
original Bavarian girl, then about 22, 23, 24 years old.
Q: So tell me, how is it that your father from Karlsruhe, and your mother from
Forst, end up in Munich? What happened?
A: My grandfather, the father of my father, he was a lawyer, and he went to
Munich, and so the whole family went to Munich. And my mother, she was a
secretary, and she wanted to leave Forst, because it was a too small city for her. So
she went at first, during the first World War, to Berlin, and she had always old aged
— old aged lovers and one of them brought her to Munich, and there he met Hans
Frank.
Q: That begs a lot of questions. Not many people start in interview knowing about
their mother’s love life.

Q: And so she — I guess what I’m trying to do is get a sense of how your — the
siblings in your early years interacted with each other. How involved were you —
A: I th—I—I would say, we were a happy family. We didn’t know how bad the
marriage was between our parents, first. It started in °42, when the marriage broke —
nearly broke. But before, and also where the children were together, it was always a
big laughter.
Q: Okay.
A: Always. We were fond of each other.
Q: That is what I wanted to get a sense of.
A: That’s for sure. And we also played with Gitty(ph), with our next older girl, but
it wasn’t the same —
Q: Okay.
A: — as Mike and me. And we had a lot of adventures, and — everywhere.
Q: Such as? What kind of adventures would little —
A: Stealing, lying, fishing, which was not allowed, and hurting other people, and
when the grand — our grandmother, the mother of my father was living with us in
Poland, in the castle of Kressendorf, Sigrid told that — told us she is a witch. So
we — we did a lot of awful things like putting dirt in front of her door, where her
apartment was [indecipherable] we had a really adventurous life.

Q: When you say these things, though, stealing and lying can be serious, or they can
be the sorts of things all children do, that is candies, or —
A: I—I—I won’t say that other children are doing this.
Q: Okay, so these —
A: I think I have — I have thought about myself a lot of it. For instance, we got a lot
of toys. Every visitor to my father, brought a lot of toys for the children, especially
for Mikey and me.
Q: Okay.
A: And we got — we got the toys, and we went to our rooms, and we immediately
destroyed the toys. We also, for instance with our trains, and we had lorries, which
we're driving, some sort. We always were building accidents. We were never
interested in the normal playing that the train 1s rolling through a room. Was boring.
But if you build up accidents, where you demolish all these — these new toys, we
were happy. And I would say one of the reasons is that our parents, and all the other
grownups, knew exactly that they don’t have to do nothing in Poland, and they saw
all the hanged people, Polish ones, they saw the Jews with the stars, they saw the
hungry faces, they knew exactly what — that they committed every day the most
horrible crimes, and they all were involved, and this bad conscious they had — it’s

my interpretation — went down in a certain way, to the children. And therefore, we
are destroying everything which we got as gift. My interpretation.
Q: Okay. But it would have been a silent kind of transmittal. That is, nobody told
you, of the grownups.
A: No, no, never.
Q: Of course not.
A: No, never.
Q: Were you, in the German word, verwohnt? Spoiled?
A: Yes. My — my father and my mother wasn’t interested to — to educated us, and to
— something like typical German people. It was all Hilde(ph). She decided what we
have to eat, and where. It was not special, and we — nobody told us that we are
princes of the governor general, something like this. So we were — in this way, we
were quite normal, but we knew, as I told you with my little car, we knew that we
have some important guy in the background.
Q: Yes, but did Hilde(ph) ever discipline you? That is, if you —
A: No.
Q: — did something wrong —
A: No, I— I don’t remember that she ever — she never clapped me, or —
Q: Or talked to you and say, this is not something that you should be doing?

Q: Okay.
A: But in a good way.
Q: Yeah. Because in every child’s life, the sense of what is right, and what is
wrong, has to be introduced by somebody.
A: That was Hilde(ph). That was Hilde(ph).
Q: Okay. Okay.
A: But in a informal way. She never gave us lessons. Today we speak about not
stealing.
Q: Of course, of course. But it’s — you know, if your parents weren’t involved, if
they were, you know, distracted, or doing other things, somebody had to.
A: Yeah, that was Hilde(ph).
Q: That was her. Tell me a little bit about your mother. And what do you remember
of her during those years. Like I said with your father.
A: Just — I really — it was after the war that I really started to get some knowledge of
who my mother was.

A: Oh yeah, that’s — that’s one scene, the castle of Kressendorf was a little bit like
Versailles, but very smaller. But from one room to the — on the other side, you have
to go about a hundred meters. So, our children rooms were on this side, and the
apartment of my mother was right on the other side. And Mikey told me, now let’s
be funny. You run to our mother, telling her that Mikey is dead. And he lay down. I
was, oh, that’s a very good idea. And run along this — in the first floor, this long
corridor. And my mother was sitting naked in the bath [indecipherable]. And I said
to her, Mutte(ph), Mutte(ph), der Micky ist tot. Mother, Mother, Michael is dead.
Q: Michael is dead.
A: And she jumped, naked as she was, jumped out, took a towel, and run behind me
to the room where —
Q: Through this long corridor.
A: — this long corridor, wet, every — and entered really, and mi — Mikey was lying
dead. And she knelt down, and then Mikey started to laugh. And I got the clap into
my face of my mother, she was so horrified. But this also is a scene which shows to
me, children knew there’s something wrong. Where we are living, what we are
doing, and so, I think it.
Q: What kind of a person was Michael? I asked about all the others, but about him,

looking guy, young guy, really great lockiges haar, I don’t know the English word.
Q: Mm-hm, curly hair.
A: Curly hairs. Very funny, full of wit. And he was so sportiv, he could kill parrots
with stones. I admired him a lot.
Q: Well, he’s your older brother.
A: Yes, but he was really, really great guy. And he loved especially, his father.
Q: He loved your father.
A: Oh, very much.
Q: How did this show itself?
A: Ah, he always was looking for him, I would say. It’s my remembrance. I — I
could put it on — on really on scenes, but you — you know what your brother is like,
that he loved your father more than me.

A: Yeah, you have to remember the scene, when I was very young, and from this
point when I was running around the round table, there was a really, healthy
distance between my father and me.
Q: When he called you a stranger.
A: Yeah. And don’t let me get into his arms. And this was — it was my s — it saved
me. It saved me, because later Mikey defended, like three others, our father, the
innocent victim. I never did. So I had an — I had an advance. But he loved — back to
Mikey, he loved him very much, and he was very sad when he was hanged. And —
Q: What did — what — what did he do when — when he learned of that? When you
say sad.
A: He started to cry. He cried a lot, and ah, he was really — we had to comfort him.
Q: Oh. He was distraught.
A: Yes, he was distraught.
Q: Okay.
A: And later, when he was 22, 23 years old, still very slim, and very sportiv, he
started suddenly to drink milk, til — til 13 liters a day.
Q: Thirteen liters a day?

A: And he married, and his wife didn’t know where to hide the milk for the babies,
because Mikey was searching all the house, to find all the last milk for the babies,
and drank it.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: And became, as you can imagine, fatter and fatter and fatter. And I think it was
because he couldn’t get around with his father.
Q: Okay.
A: It was — the oldest brother, Norman, became an alcoholic. The second — the
eldest daughter, Sigrid emigrated with her second husband to South Africa,
because they liked very much the apartheid. Michael drank a lot of milk, til he was
dying. Brigitte committed suicide because she didn’t want to become older than our
father. And who 1s still alive, and very happy? Niklas.
Q: And you put it down to the favor, from the very beginning, that your father did
you when he wouldn’t take you in his arms.
A: I—I would say so. I would say so. I may — maybe at — and I’m very, very happy
that he was hanged. I am completely against death penalty, but in this case, he had
earned it. And imagine he would have survived? He would have poisoned my brain,
when you are young. That’s not easy, to live with a guy who was so well educated
as my father was.

Q: Although I’ve read some of the articles that were written, some of them are very,
very good, very detailed. Very, very good —
A: Oh yeah. I had to rewrite them.
Q: You said when you were little, and he didn’t take you in his arms and — in this
Schloss Bellevue, were — you were stunned. Is that right? How come he doesn’t do
it, ’'m being rejected? And that’s the feeling you had of distance? Is this what I’m
trying to understand?

because I was very happy with Mikey. Maybe because of Hilde(ph), because I was
very happy also with Hilde. Maybe because of all the others around being so
experienced, because of my little car, because of all what I experienced. Becaut of —
because of killing fishes, and killing birds around the lake of Schliersee. A lot of
other thing were good for me.
Q: Okay.
A: But it was a distant which survived everything. Also, you asked for my mother.
Q: Yeah.
A: When my father was hanged, my mother — that was the 16" of October in 1946.
We were in the kinderheim.
Q: You were in — uh-huh —
A: And — at this time. And my mother visited us, Gitty(ph), Mike(ph) and me, and
she had spring clothes, full of color, and like it was spring, but it was late of
autumn.
Q: Yeah, it’s October.
A: And she took us to a walk, and told us that now our father is dead, and he is in
heaven. And for me it was just information, I was — I knew it already, because we —
when we visited him last time, I knew that he will be hanged. So for me it was quite
a confirmation.

Q: You knew because someone told you?
A: No, no. And so — and Mikey was starting to cry, and also Gitty(ph) — Brigitte
was starting to cry. And my mother said to them, why do you cry? Your father is
happy in heaven now, and look at Niki(ph), he also don’t cry, and then he pressed
my hand and said, why are you not crying? And so, just as I — the distant. I don’t
have a personal — I had no personal feeling, like. And by the way, I always was very
pragmatic in my life. Now I knew the next time we will see our mother, she will tell
us that our father is dead.
Q: You knew it, but no adult had told you that this would be.
A: Well, in the summer of ’46, his lawyer, Dr. Zeidel(ph) came to our family and
said, Mrs. Frank, there is no chance. He will get the death penalty, for sure. The
proofs against him are so magnificent, are so unbelievable, and he couldn’t do any —
Q: You were — you were in earshot of this?
A: It was also — it was — I knew it then. I know it was connecting with the visit of
Mr. Zeidel(ph). And everybody else, also my brother Norman, and so — so we
talked to each other about it. I don’t know exactly the conversations any more. But I
knew that when the invitation co — came in September, we had to go — September

father alive.
Q: So it’s actually the first and the last visit —
A: Yes.
Q: — for you, and it was you and all of his children, and your mother.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: And it was — and it’s because Mr. Zeidel(ph) had come to your home, and the
children talked about it with one another, that you were already aware.
A: Yes, also from my mother.
Q: Okay, so she had told you about this?
A: No, it’s — then I was six — six and seven years old.
Q: Yeah.
A: I can’t repeat you conversations.
Q: Of course, of course.
A: I know only that I knew he will get the death penalty, and it will be over. So that
was — I—I can’t repeat anything. But I know then from Norman also, which I
talked to him a lot during our life, that it was Zeidel’s(ph) visit who ended all our
hopes — or their hopes, not my hope — that he will survive. And by the way,
whenever I was already in school, and I came to school in the autumn of ’45. And

the Nuremberg trial was broadcasted. Every evening there was one hour they
talked about the day. And everybody, because we knew each other, everybody in
the family of the other children, the parents of them, they’re talking about it. Also
Hans Frank was in the prison in Nuremberg, and that’s this big trial. And the
children in my school sometimes said to me, one of them, that, hi Niki(ph), you
know now your father will be hanged. And I said yes. So, it was some — it wasn’t
cruel. They knew it.
Q: It was common knowledge.
A: It was common knowledge, yes.
Q: Okay. I want to — Pll jump ahead, and then I'll move back.
A: Like me.
Q: But I remember in your book, you — you say afterwards, that your Aunt

Q: My — my sincere apologies. My sincere apologies. How could I? How could I?
Okay. So Tante Marta(ph) knew how to speak to the dead, yeah? And she would
have séances, and in those first months afterwards, your mother participated in
them. And lo and behold there were — there was communication with your father,
yes? In these séances. And then your uncle passed away, and then that stopped.
A: He committed suicide.
Q: Yeah.
A: He threw himself under a train.
Q: And why did he do that, by the way?
A: Because of his wife. I don’t know. I don’t know.
Q: You don’t know.
A: She was a little bit — he was crazy.
Q: Okay.
A: He was out of his brain, he also was running along the main street in Munich,
Kaufingerstrasse, and throwing stones into the windows. And my Aunt Marta(ph)
was running by, and to — to stop him as well. He was —
Q: So maybe he was mentally ill?
A: Yes, he was, for sure.

Interview with Niklas Frank “
June 6, 2016
Q: Okay. But what I wanted to say with this, is that there is a section where you
write, that when the communications with your father ceased — that is, you kept —
you know, in the séance, they kept wanting to bring his spirit up, you yourself tried
to do so. I think it was, you know, if Uncle Julius was a butterfly, then you were
seeing, was your father here, was your father there. And it ended up with a little
dog, that you thought maybe his spirit had rested in the little dog?
A: Yes, but was — was more on the funny side, in the — in this book. This, with the —
with the butterfly is correct. It wasn’t me, but it was Tante Marta(ph) —
Q: That’s right.
A: — she was sitting in the English garden, and suddenly Uncle Julius came along
as a butterfly.
Q: The butterfly.
A: And the dog also as well, yes.
Q: The reason why I bring it up is that when I read that passage, yes, I know it was
supposed to be humorous, but it also gave me a sense of a child who is missing his
father, who wonders whether his father is here, his father is there, his father is
someplace else.
A: Maybe.
Q: Did you miss him?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Niklas Frank "
June 6, 2016
A: I didn’t know him. Hm. I’m not sure. I — I would say, more I would say because
as anormal child, you are missing your father, it could be, for sure. But it’s not
something which haunts me.
Q: Yeah.
A: Or has haunted me. Could be. The good thing was in this time, that a lot of
families, they lost their father due to the war. They all were killed in the
Wehrmacht. So, it was comparable to other families who — where the children also
grew up without a father. The special thing on the Frank family and this, it was like
an honor. You were special because your father got a year long trial, and
afterwards, he wasn’t shot by a Russian in the war, or by a French, or an English,
but he was hanged, so that was special. So —
Q: Prestigious, in a way?
A: Ina way, prestigious. We were something special. And, don’t forget, my father
was sitting in the first row of the defendants, not in the second one.
Q: Even more special.
A: My mother liked it, my mother, it’s even more special.
Q: I want to go back to the descriptions of the other two places. You gave us a
description of Schoberhof. First, a question: why did you have the Wawel and

Kressendorf as places to live? Why was it two for the family? Or were there
different functions of each place?
A: In the Wawel were a lot of — also the — the government, his prime minister and
all this kind of stuff was always there.
Q: So it was like a — a government building? It was a castle, but it was a
government building?
A: Yes, yes, yes, well, a lot of government in it, and that was our weekend castle.
We enjoyed it very much.
Q: The Wawel?
A: No, no, the weekend castle was Kressendorf.
Q: I see.
A: So you — mostly was there. Then he — his official castle was the Wawel.
Q: Okay.
A: Where he did all his work during the day. But on weekends, and also during the
weekend, he could decide when he was — wants to work or not. So he was very
often at Kressendorf.
Q: So describe to me both places. What did they look like, and what were they?
A: Wawel is — for me it was, as a child, a lot of very long, empty aisles.
Q: Mm-hm. Corridors?

A: Corridors, corridors, yes, corridors. And beautiful rooms, beautiful rooms full of

Q: Tapestries, yeah.
A: And — tapestries, yes. Was really good to live in, but my memory, I have no
memories that I slept there, but I must have slept there, because in the morning
when my father was shaving himself — I don’t have any memory.
Q: Okay.
A: More memories, I exactly knew — to know this, Kressendorf is now a ruin. I
know exactly where my room was, where I slept in with Mikey together. So I was
more in Kressendorf, I would say, in all those years.
Q: These —
A: And I remember, especially from the Wawel, the big festivities my father gave —
Q: Okay.
A: — to the German big shots.
Q: So what kind of festivities were these?
A: They were really with big candelabras, and really everybody in wonderful
clothes, and we had to give everybody our hand, and hand kisses to the women.
This I have in — in — til in my head, because Mikey and me, we must always laugh,

and we mixed it up, we then kissed the hands of the guys, and then made our
[bows] to the ladies, and so on. Was funny.
Q: So tell us, so that now is not from the eyes of a child, but so that people will
know, these are not just any old places in buildings, in Polish history. Can you tell
us what was the Wawel, what was Kressendorf, what was Bellevue?
A: Wawel was — Wawel was the old capital of the Polish empire, let’s say it this
way, and a lot of Polish kings are buried inside the cathedral on the Wawel. And the
special thing is, unbelievable me til nowadays, Mikey and I, we played seek-hide?
Q: Hide and seek.
A: Hide and seek, inside this cathedral. So we — we hided behind wonderful graves,
and holy people, and — and lying — not down in the catacomb where the — where all
the Pilsudski is — had his grave. But somebody was, that they allowed us to play
there, hide and seek.
Q: So this is sort of like the central place of Polish kings?
A: It was the central place for the Polish people. And immediately, my father
forbade, when he took over [indecipherable] immediately shut it down, no Polish
person could enter the cathedral, which was one of the most holy ones in — in
Poland, besides Czestochowa.

them, and not upstairs with the kitchen of ours, so we liked the soldiers, as all the
children. And they were very nice to us.
Q: Were they? And they we — these were SS, rather than another branch, or not —
not the police, or Wehrmacht, or anything like that?
A: No, it was the SS who was guarding it.
Q: So you had — you had these guards at your family place, so you would be safe, in
other words.
A: Yes. Also around the Wawel.
Q: Okay.
A: But on the other hand, which is really strange, Norman, visiting the German
school in Krakow, left with a cycle every morning, rode through a park, along
streets, and nobody ever hunted him down or killed him. And that was really
strange.

Nuremberg said to his secretary, there is this bloody stupid guy Hans Frank, who
handed over all the proofs against him. And he really was right.
Q: Did you ever read any part of those diaries?
A: Oh, yes. Some parts I can know by heart. For instance, when he was traveling,
after we invaded Soviet Union — Galicia was the capital of Lemberg, or Lviv, or
Lwow, was ki— came to the governor general, and one year after this invasion he
came to the city of Lemberg, addressing about 300 German administration people,
and they had — I just came through this old Jewish nest, by the way. I didn’t see
anybody of those flat footed Indians. What have you done with them? Had you ever

hilarity. That was —

A: Yes. Whatever happens after the war, maybe you can make mincemeat out of the
Polish or Ukrainians, or whatever is running around here. Well-educated man my
father was, playing wonderfully piano, knowing Shakespeare by heart, and our
German most important poet, Goethe. And he was saying sentences like this.
Q: Is it through these pages that you got to know him?
A: No, I knew him before, through all the documents I had. But the diary always
was with me.
Q: And what other kinds of documents did you have, in order to —
A: A lot of letters he wrote. Because my mother always kept them. Also, very nice
letters in early times of their marriage, and then very ugly ones. And the most ugly
ones is that he wanted — he really terribly wanted the divorce. And knowing what
was going on in his country, the mass murdering of Jews, he wrote to my mother, I
will go into the dark. I see mountains of corpses. Don’t follow me. Please give me
free, and stay out of it, and give me the divorce, and [indecipherable] not written
down, said I can marry Lilly. So he took the Holocaust as a trick to get the divorce.
Nice guy. He gave a shit about the Jews and all the others. Like my mother. My
mother has a lot of f-friends in the — with the Jewish agents, it’s called Jtidische
Agenten, who had all these dealings with furs, and —

A: Yes, but yeah, but she met them again, and when she was entering the — the
ghetto, the Krakow ghetto, and the Warsaw ghetto, and looking for furs and other
precious things, she must have seen some of them again. And there’s a scene which
I wrote in my other book against my mother. There was a — a Jewish agent of hers,
which — whom she had really very good business.
Q: So this is a prewar rel-relationship. It started in prewar?
A: Yes, yes. And — but then it was before America entered the war, all the German
Jews tried to get the visa out for the United States, and other countries. And he was
standing in this row, and suddenly he saw my mother walking by with two
girlfriends of her, and he went to her and saying, I am your old agent, Mrs.
Reichsminister. | am Flombom(ph). I terribly need a visa, could you please help
me? And my mother answered to him, that’s strange. My husband told me there are
no difficulties. You will get your visa, I am sure of. I also got my passport for
diplomats. So I would say, 70 to 30, you will get your visa. See, I know of one of
the girlfriends who accompanied her. He didn’t show up after the war, though. They
must have killed him, the Germans, my father. But after the war, the Schoberhof
was plundered.

Q: Forced laborers.
A: Forced laborers from the Ukraine and from Russia and from Poland, especially
from Poland. And now they were — suddenly they were free, and suddenly they
were the masters. So they entered the Schoberhof and plundered it. And my mother
took the three smallest children, Brigitte, Micky and me, to a neighbor of hers,
Mrs. Von Langsdorf(ph), and told her we have to — can you hide us? Because I am
fear for the life of my children. And by the way, here is this big handbag, please
could you hide it as well, and I will get it back in two or three weeks, whenever
time goes by. And we slept on the — up there, under the roof.
Q: Mm-hm, in the attic.
A: And then, three weeks later, my mother ordered Mrs. Von Langsdorf(ph) to
bring her bags back. And fortunately she was curious enough and had a look in it,
and it was full of jewelry, and halskette, and armband —
Q: Necklaces, and bracelets and —
A: — and all this — necklace, all this kind of stuff. And — but she gave it, and then my
mother, there was no Mercedes left, just her cycle, and there was a camp for
displaced persons. The Jewish people who had survived were in certain areas, to
wait for the visas. And she took two or three of this presious — precious things and
drove to this camp. And two of the Jews recognized her again. She — they knew her

from her visits in the Krakow ghetto. And how’s the Jewish humor? They
addressed her still Frau Minister. And my mother said to them, I have this, you can
get it. But I need flour, butter, meat, to nourish my children. And during the night
there come an old car with all this stuff. And they made a fortune, and we don’t
have to starve any more. That was my mother.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: My mother, on the other hand, was, I think the only person I met in my la — life,
who was living strictly to reality. When the Third Reich and her luxury was over,
she acknowledged it immediately. It’s over now. It’s over. She never glorified in
front of me, the Third Reich, the powerful living she had. All these servants, all this
kind of stuff. She never glorified it. Now, she was poor again, like in the beginning
of her life, and now she had to nourish five stupid children. And she did it. She did
it. So she died worn out in the age of 62.
Q: What year?
A: Fifty-nine, on my birthday. We had another interview and — this morning, where
I answered this question for you.

morning.
A: I don’t know much more about it. I know my — my own [indecipherable] and I
knew by the friends, for instance by Tante Margot(ph), and all the other, said that
very often was in the ghettos.
Q: Okay.
A: Always on — and you have to imagine, the Jewish people were the last

general shows up, they had the desperate hope that if they sell her, for a cheap price,
maybe she will do something that they can survive. My mother didn’t do nothing
about it.
Q: So she just took advantage of her ability to —
A: Yes, yes, yes.
Q: Now, was the Schoberhof filled with all of these types of items, of paintings, of
goods —

Q: So all of that was there?
A: Yes. It was one of the most precious museums at that time, if you look around
Europe. And — but this where all the wa — always — all of this was handed over to
the Americans. And only the Raphael is missing still nowadays. I assume that this
Raphael is hanging in a farmer’s kitchen.
Q: In Germany?

was not big, this size. And got some bread and butter and something, some
chickens.

laborers, it wasn’t stuff like this that they were finding.

also put some guards around the Schoberhof.

still at home, were they off someplace else? Were you all together?

A: Because, they say to my sister Sigrid, what we have done to the Jews, they will
never forgive us. So far that the Germans are telling you, nobody knew anything.
When it was — Sigrid wrote it in a kind of, we know this. So it was like — and

What we have done to the Jews, so they will kill us now.

brought to trial, that he’s 1n the first row, why is it that you visited him only once, in
September of ’46?
A: It was prohibited that — you ti — can’t visit the defendants.
Q: Okay.

verdicts, there was suddenly the permission, that the family of the defendants, not

lap of my mother. He was sitting behind the window, with a small gitter, that we
could understand each other. And I was sitting there, and my father laughed —
Q: Screen, mm-hm.
A: — and said to me, hi Niki(ph), nice to see you. Soon we will celebrate a happy
Christmas in Schoberhof. And I said to myself, why is he lying? Why is he lying?
He knows that he is going to be hanged. Because I knew that.
Q: Yeah, you told us earlier that there was di — it was, by then, common knowledge.
A: Yeah.
Q: And you’re seven years old, and you re — and you think this to yourself.
A: Yeah, it was really disappointing.
Q: Did he have any other words to any of the other children?
A: The strange thing is that my brother Michael never told anybody what our father
told him. Also, not to his children. That’s really strange. Now he’s dead, a long time
ago. And to Norman, he was alone, without our mother, because he was grownup,
nearly. And to Norman he said, I’m — I can’t leave you anything but the manuscript
which I wrote in the prison. And remember always, I am a man of law, I’m not a

my brother about this command, is that wise for a life?
Q: What does it mean?
A: Don’t talk too much. Don’t talk too much. Because he was sentenced to death
because of what he was talking in the first-hand. And I always say, that was an
advice of my father to be a coward. And my brother Norman said no, it was just to
be silent. And I was silent, and I said, so you was a coward, huh? As your father
said to you you should be.
Q: So that was — that was a point of contention between you and bra — and your
brother Norman.
A: Yeah. And then he wrote in his last letter to my brother Norman, this is
[indecipherable] we have to die, in this war. We will follow millions of our
soldiers, of our brave soldiers, who were — already has been killed in this war. And
what true ar — should I do with the rest of my life, for instance? Should I be dealt in
revenge from immigrants, traitors? So I prefer to be dead. So the immigrants were —

can’t fight this dictatorship, but we don’t want to do anything with it, and so they
emigrate. So they wa — they were the brave ones, and the — the really good ones. So
he — he hadn't got any idea, and he never acknowledged, after a year of trial, where
the Americans, the English and the French, and the Russian have shown them a lot
of documents, even a movie about Auschwitz. What kind of horrible crimes this
bunch of criminals has committed? And then he is writing something like this. And
he wrote to his lawyer, Mr. Zeidel(ph), and also to our mother, please make sure
that the future will see the true Frank. I was never a criminal. And my mother la —
something is like — he never acknowledged anything.
Q: And do you remember how your mother reacted to it?
A: No. [indecipherable] But there was this 18" of April in 1946, he was on the
stand, trial. And he was asked by Mr. Zeidel(ph), his defendant — his lawyer —
Q: Lawyer.
A: — and asked him, have you ever had something to do with the extinguishing of
Jews — extermination of Jews? And my father, after a short silence, he said yes. I
never ordered to build up a concentration camp, but if I now look back what we
have done, and my own diary is a witness against me. What we have said, what we
have done, I only have to acknowledge this guilt. A thousand years will pass
without taking away this guilt from the German people.

Q: Your father said this?
A: Yes. Now I ask you, when I am asked from my lawyer, have you personally
something to do with the extermination camps, why I suddenly distribute my guilt
on 80 million other German shoulders? And I just have finished a book from a
German defense lawyer, and all the defense lawyers were sitting there, as he
remembered, and saying, what is this Frank doing? At first he admitted his
personal guilt, and suddenly it’s vanished about 80 million shoulders. So this was
also, the lead for the German people, how to react. We never acknowledged our
guilt. We have built a lot of monuments, and we are a beautiful example for the
other world, what we have done with our past, and how — how great we were in
acknowledge — it’s just the surface. The German people, still I am very much afraid
of.
Q: Why?
A: They never acknowledged our crimes, never. It was just a— we have to do this
because the world is looking for that the Germans have to do something. So we
built some monuments, and the German historians did a very good job. There is no
German crime which was not thoroughly researched and written down. Everybody
can read it, but also, if you read it as a normal German, you will never acknowledge
this, really.

Q: Why?
A: Because the Germans have a lock — a lack — a lack of empathy. The Germans
can’t put themselves in the soul, or in the situation, let’s say, of a Jewish mother
who has two children, who is forced by German soldiers or German
[indecipherable] police, into a cattle car, is driven through days and nights without
any food or water, embracing the little childrens, and then thrown out of the cattle
car, to the ramp of Auschwitz, for instance, and then they took away the two
children. They can’t do this. And I am reading in schools or somewhere, I always
said, have you ever tried to do this? Every German knows what really had
happened, what we have done. Have you ever put yourself in the situation like this?
And they all went no. They don’t do that, they can’t do it. That’s the special thing
about the Germans.
Q: But in this, I — this takes our story away from your life, and the postwar
development of it, but we’re talking now about German society. And this is a very
dim view of Germans, as a people. And it doesn’t sound — how shall I say it? I’'d
need — I need —
A: Honestly.

make such an overall, arching statement that Germans have no empathy”?

was suddenly proud. But now, we do have about 600 — was last year about 600
different burning downs of homes for refugees. We have beaten up people, we have
even killings. So, you have to see the German people like a dark, a dark ball. And
on this ball, let’s say we are 80 millions are this ball. Out of this 80 millions, and I
make it very positively, let’s say are 10 million Germans who are on this dark ball.
They are running around. They are really, true democrats. They are really looking
that we stay a democracy. But this ball is still very, very ignorant, and very, very
against everything was — what is hurting them in their — yeah, in their bad
conscious, I would say.

had to — Father O’Connor accompanied Andrews and the guards. Said to him,
Father, my mother used to give me the cross on my forehead before I went to school
every morning. Please do this, as well. And when I was telling this Philippe inside
the cell, I suddenly was very near to my father, and the first time I think I really had
some pity for him. Suddenly I understand that’s the action of a ham actor. And

A: Yeah, because you have always pictured of his victims, in the brain.
Q: Tell me how life progressed for your family after that. What happened with your
mother, how did she —
A: My mother published the book of my father, it was at first published by a
publishing company, but it was a total flop. And then she took over, founded her
own publishing company, Eine Falak(ph), Brigitte Frank. And at first she
addressed every Catholic priest. She printed the book — I will never forget it, for 4
mark, 50 fennig, and sold it for about 19 marks, 50 fennig, and she never paid a
penny of taxes. So, she made quite a fortune, I would say. About 200 — 250,000
deutschmark, or German marks.
Q: That’s a lot of money then.
A: So she la — she — she suddenly had again, a fur, and was sitting in her beloved

wrote, my little children, they are starving and so on. Please buy this copy, and you

I have a different approach to my mother, and I found out, which I’ve never written,
because my books were finished, I found a letter which I didn’t really see before. In
this letter to a friend, she wrote, when I remember the times gone by, we really were
merciless. And that is, at least, a very honest acknowledgment also, what she has
done.

up to say what I have just said. It’s so unbelievable. He must have read the same
thing that I quoted before. They are in there. But he was always defending him.

A: And we are told that they knew more about different situations in the family.
They were telling them, laughing about it, and I was very interested in — to hear all
this, what I don’t know because I was the youngest one. It was always very funny
when we were together. Always — also when we are struggling against each other,
we never lost our — all right, we’ll say we never lost our love.
Q: Well, that was my question, 1s what kind of relations you had with each other
afterwards?
A: Great. Very good, very good. And when my book came out, my brother Michael
attacked me in public, heavily, that I am a liar and nothing is true what I have
written, and all this kind of stuff. But we decided, you can do this, Pll do — go my
way, and we have nice children, so we don’t let destroy our personal relationship.
And that was a good idea.

every weekend together. It was two or three times in a year.
Q: But she took her own life.
A: She took her own life, yes.
Q: And why?
A: She had cancer, but as the doctors told me is she could have survived about five,
six, Seven years. But she has written in her diary when she was 16 years old, I don’t
want to became older than Fatti(ph) — our father. And this was a self-fulfilling
promise.
Q: Prophecy.
A: Which she did.
Q: Did she have children?
A: And she did it in an awful, very awful manner. She had from different — two
different husbands, two sons. And with — from the second husband, her son, he was
eight years old when she committed suicide, and she did it the following way. She
took this eight year old boy into her bed in the evening. Told him, now it’s nice day,
let’s sleep together. So he slept during the night, and when he woke up, his mother
was lying beside him, dead. Because she committed with lot of tablets and alcohol,

Q: Did — did this burden, was it visited on your children, the other generation, the
children of your siblings?
A: I don’t know the word burden.
Q: All right.
A: If you acknowledge something, you — you — mostly you are like me. When I
think of my father, when I think of the victims, and when I think of what he could
have done to — to leave his job —
Q: Yeah.
A: — and to go into the inner immigration, that’s for — I’m always furious about him.
Still furious. Why has he done it? But it’s not a burden.
Q: Then maybe I’m choosing the wrong word, but nevertheless, it’s an influence.
A: For sure it’s an influence.
Q: It’s — it was an influence, and it was something that became part of your life.
A: I never — I never had a father who was a carpenter, or the engineer, or a teacher.

A: For sure. The best way I did for my daughter, which she told in an interview — I
was really surprised — she said that my father build around me, a wall, because of
what he has written, and what he has done. But he doesn’t mean it the way he build
up a wall that I don’t know anything. On the other hand, that I can live secured. I
know everything, what my father found out about my grandfather, so I — I can lead
my own life, my happy life.
Q: That’s a huge thing.
A: I was very satisfied when I heard this.
Q: Yeah.
A: She never said it to me.

Johannesburg, and she knew my book, it was published in the meantime. She al —
also had read it, but she said only something like, so you have something written,
haven’t you? Not more.
Q: So she didn’t comment on it.
A: But — but I— I know that she was very furious about it, like my brother Norman,
by the way, he also was very furious about the book.
Q: Why?
A: Because of this advice of our father —
Q: To stay silent.
A: — he never wanted to be a — a — in public. And so he also wanted never to be in
public, a discussion about what his father has done. That was the main reason.
Q: And this was quite public. This was quite public.
A: It was, yes.
Q: And di —
A: And it was the first book in Germany, and like, was also — it — it sounds a little
bit vain, but it was the only book in German literature of — no, not literature, in
Germany from an heir of some top Nazi, who attacked his father. And with very
foul language. That was a significant thing.

12 weeks.
Q: And — and this had been after you had been looking at the documents, and
reading about this —
A: I had nearly everything together, but it never will end, I — in the meantime, I
have a lot of more documents.
Q: Around the same time, Peter Sichrovsky wrote a book, called “Schuldig
geboren: Kinder aus Nazifamilien.” Do you know any of the children who he
interviewed for that book?
A: Peter Sichrovsky was a friend of mine, and I asked him, and it’s all invented.
Q: Really?
A: It’s all invented. I would say so. It’s all invented. It’s too — too perfect, and never
anybody of those people showed up, never. And there’s also another proof that
everything was invented. I know him. Later on he wa — he became very right-

having actual proof, that he did —

right, I know this.
Q: Did other children of other Nazis get in touch with you after your book was
published?
A: Yes. In a negative way. The son of Hess, for instance, we were invited to a talk
session for the Bavarian Broadcasting System, and when he — and — and he said,
okay, I will come. And then he heard that I — also I will show up, and he
immediately canceled his appearance. And there was American author, Gerry
Posner, who also, by the way, files closed about the killing of Kennedy. And he

daughter of Hermann Goring, Edda Goring. And they said to me, Niklas, it’s
better if you call her first. I terribly need an interview with her for my book, it
would be great, you know. And I said okay, give me the number, and I dialed, and
said — somebody got to the phone saying Goring. And I said hello, Mrs. Goring.
My name is Niklas Frank. Besides me is standing Gerry — and then she interrupted
me, said, one moment, one moment. Are you the one who was — has written this
unbelievable ugly book about his father? And I said yes, and bang.
Q: There went the telephone.
A: Was a— was [indecipherable] that. And the son of Bormann, who was a priest,
but later he wrote all the book about his father, is not a priest any more. And ye —

him, and in this interview for his book, he said he would like to — to — to get
together — to come together with Niklas Frank. And “Stern” magazine, the chief
editor told me [indecipherable] that’s a good story, let’s do it, and you talk to each
other, and so — and then they arranged it. But in the meantime, Mr. Bormann
junior, whose first name also is Martin, Mr. Bormann has read “The Father,” and
didn’t want to have to do anything with me.

Q: Was there — why do you think that’s the case? Because you were so vociferous,
so unrelenting about your father? Were there — and what — were there reasons that
were ever given to you?
A: Marty Bormann, for instance, yes, he — had a lot of lessons in schools, yes?
And he always used to have a picture with him, of his father. And he said to the
auditorium, I know my father was a criminal, but I also know that he was a most
wonderful father. And if you say this in Germany, immediately, the site of the
crimes which your father has committed, is gone, and in the German brains, is still
alive, a wonderful father. What about those bloody crimes, they are gone. But the
wonderful father. This Peter Sichrovsky you mentioned before, he is Jewish. He
was personally saved by an SS officer, out of a cattle car, as far as I know, yes. He
was blue eyed and blonde hair, yes? And I told it, in a big auditorium, only once,
that there also was an SS man who, for instance, saved a Jewish boy, was looking
like an Aryan boy, blue eyes, blonde hair. And you can see it, as well, about 300
people in this, they all leaned back, very happy suddenly. We haven’t done anything
bad, we have saved the little boy. So the complete crimes, were gone. So I will —
I’ve never done this again.
Q: But this is what Norman also says. I mean, in the book that you write about your

whatever my father has said or done, it’s gone. It’s still the love. Therefore, he
became an alcoholic, and my brother was drinking milk. If you don’t acknowledge
the truth — I tell you how my mother was. When the death — when the sentences
were delivered from the judges, it was broadcasted lively, yes? My mother has
written down with her pencil, all the names, Goring, Ribbentrop, Funk, Keitel,
Seyss-Inquart, Howe, all the names. We’re sitting in front of the radio with a

pencil, and who was sentenced to death, she made a cross. By 20 years, 20 years;
life, L, and so on. And when it came to her husband, Hans Frank, getting the death
penalty, she made, in all coolness, a cross. Great. That’s acknowledged. That’s
acknowledgement of what is reality. Therefore, I love my mother. She was not
pretending that, oh, this innocent guy. She knew exactly that he has deserved it.
Q: So, how come her children didn’t? I mean, a mother can influence a —
A: It’s a—it’s a big taboo around the world. You should honor your parents, and
love them, whatever they have done.
Q: So, you mean, the 10 commandments.
A: I acknowledge this taboo. Yes, something like this. But I can’t do it. It’s for sure
and — they — they didn’t — they didn’t run around the table, and — and bury it there.
So it was my advantage, and they had the advantage that they have very lovely
memories of our father. So you have — they have the bigger — the bigger struggle, if
they would have succeeded. Their struggling would have been much stronger than
mine. I couldn’t stand this guy, but they really have loved him. He was very funny,
my father, he was very funny. He was very Bavarian style, and if he was at home,
and he was in good mood. So they had a heavy task, and my brother Norman, he —
he tried it lifelong. But he was open, at least, to my documents. And we were sitting
together, there was a lot of speeches of my father still recorded. You can hear him,

yes? And we were sitting and hearing them, my brother was so furious like I was.
H-He — he couldn’t stand this crap what my father was speaking.
Q: So all — of all of the children, he was with you on that. He was somebody who
could say yes, this isn’t —
A: Yes, yes.
Q: — this is no good, this is — but you’ve done something else, is that you’ve made it
all public. That is, your relationship to him, your relationship to your mother, you
relation —
A: No, it was so — I don’t know. I didn’t mention my first book because bi —
Gitty(ph) was dead already. All the other were still alive.
Q: Okay.
A: I never mentioned a sibling of mine. Never. Because they are not the address. So
as ever — I never mention it. I wrote it as if I was only child of them. That’s — it’s an
etiquette thing. You can’t do this without permission of this guy. So, when I wrote
my mother, only Norman was still alive. And I — when I wrote Norman, Norman
was already dead. Before, I would never have done it.
Q: Okay. Let me rephrase it then.
A: In the good English.

critique, your —
A: No, that was —
Q: — whatever it is, you put that through the, you know, in your relationship with
your father first, then with your mother, and then with Norman.
A: Yeah.
Q: And one — in one of the reviews it’s sort of like you — you say that, okay, I’ve
undressed us for the world to see. Someth — that’s a paraphrase, but that’s
something of what it’s like.
A: Yes, because what always disturbed me very much, that is the silence in
Germany. This not acknowledging what we have done. We shouldn’t go around
with a doggish eyes, always feeling ashamed. Life is much too strong, live your life.
But acknowledge it like [indecipherable] football. Acknowledge what we have
done. We are not personally responsible, but by chance, we are Germans. So you
have to — and if you acknowledge this, then will happen the second thing. You
become very, very infuriated whenever you hear again something about the crimes
we have committed, yes? Like I told you before, looking at children — faces of
Jewish children who were forced to go to stay, th-there’s a — every German, because

of our sc-school system, they learn a lot about the Holocaust, so every German has
pictures in his mind. So that’s the second thing, you don’t — will be ashamed, but —
and that would be also, wrong way, but bef — become furious, and get a little bit
more civil courage. The more you know about the cowardice of your parents and
grandparents, the more you will find out what I found out, a thousand times with
myself. Ah, Niki(ph), now you are becoming a coward. Don’t do this like your
father. Be strong. And it’s not committing a crime, it’s just a day in the “Stern”
magazine, and all this kind of stuff. You can get yourself more — yeah, more civil
courage, and staying as a — as a democrat.
Q: What do you — what do you hope, or what do you think the contribution of
making your life and your relation to mother, to father, to — to Norman, public in
the books, what do you hope that it gives to the audiences, to the public?
A: To do it themselves, in their own family. That’s — that’s the only reason why I
did it. We have to talk about it. We have to talk inside the families. I always
recommend it when I am finished with my — I always read out of the books, and
then we have always a very lively discussion. And then I am always telling them,
look at your home, look at — ask your grandparents, and — if they are still alive, ask
them, what’s really — what have you experienced, what were you — and — and if they
are strong, they will say to you, my dear grandchild, I was such a coward. I knew

exactly that mine Jewish neighbors were thrown away, and I have to confess, I took
a big, big wonderful painting out of this Jewish family. If this is, that would be
great. And I have to acknowledge, I have a lot of letters, mails, personal calls,
which say, the first time I started to look in the history of my family.
Q: That was my next question, yeah.
A: And I found out is that — is for me, really satisfying. Last time was — my wife,
she 1s not very keen to have telephone calls. And there was a man who was 65 years
old. And I — he asked me three months before, gave me a call. Niklas Frank is a
very rare name, he-he found me in the telephone book, and told me, I am so
desperate. I know my father was this and that, but I can’t find anything. He was re —
really a simple man, I have to admit. And I told him what he has to do, writing to
this archive, and this archive, always giving the exact dates of his father, and so on.
And then he did it, and unfortunately my wife was on the phone, I was abroad, and
he was so crazy to thank me, and that it was so wonderful. It’s the first time I found
out what this guy had done. It wasn’t so — so really famous. But, he was so happy.
That was a — if I get this, it’s really good.

compare it with the world.
Q: Okay.
A: No, be serious.

A: If you compare it with the world, you have nothing in the end. You can just say,
every human being has an ugly face in it. It is saying nothing. If you are talking
about my life —
Q: Yes.
A: — and about the jailed Germans, then I am the biggest chauvinist you can
imagine. It’s only the German crimes, because we have done the worst thing in the
world, and we should know better. If you don’t have civil courage, we will do it
again. And if you look now to Germany, with the refugee problems, we are only a
good [indecipherable] democracy. We have never proved since ’45, after we lost
the war, that we are really a democracy, that we have really a civil courage. That is

—I don’t want to hear nothing, not even about Austria, or France, or Greece, or
Poland, or — or here, the republicans and the democrats, or the thousand mer —
thousand American dictatorships. It doesn’t interest me. I am a German, and I want
to make sure that the Germans, we are like the Jews, we are a chosen people. Not
through God, through our crimes. And we should know exactly how — how far it
can lead if you don’t have civil courage. It leads my father to the gallows, and it
leads a million of innocent people into the death. So never mention this again, that
other people also have done this. Bad.
Q: I think you’re right. I think this — I think this is the conclusion of our interview.
A: Thank you. See ya.

much for that. And thank you very much for the rest of the interview, and sharing
your thoughts with us, and sharing much more.

and I always say, are you a German? You are a German. How did you deal with
your parents, your grandparents? There may be love, big [indecipherable]. But
what have they done? Have you ever looked at it? How do you feel? You have the
pictures and — in your brain with — with the killed people. How do you react? Why I
am example for you? Everybody has to do this. That would be good.

Beginning Part Two

Q: This is Leslie Swift, recording a segment of an interview with Niklas Frank, on
June 6"", 2016, and we will be focusing right now on — mostly on Niklas’s book,
and what he talks about, his father and his family, in the book. So Niklas, wa — we
spend a lot of time studying here at the museum, what leads people to other-ise
Jews and — and other — other people, and — to the point where they are no longer
human, and thus disposable. Can you trace for us, to the best of your understanding,
this person — the personal journey that led your father from being someone who was
trained in the law, and presumably respected it, to the acceptance, and even
enthusiastic participation in mass murder?
A: I think — I know my father wasn’t an anti-Semitic. And he wanted to have a
career. And if Hitler would have chosen not the Jews, but let’s say the Italians, or
the Gypsies, or — Gypsies had had already chosen — or let’s say the Swedish people,
he would have said the same sentences against them. It was just that he wanted to
be near to Hitler, and he wanted to have a good career.
Q: So he didn’t have this underlying anti-Jewish feeling that some of the other true
believers did.

A: No. [have his youth diary. He wrote it — it’s not very thick — he wrote it in the
time when he was 17 til the 20" year of his life. And there was not a single remark
against the Jews. And it was already after the first World War. So when Germany
really was on the button, and big inflation and took away some parts of Germany,
and all this kind of stuff, he only complained about the French, and not about the
Jews.
Q: About the occupation of the [indecipherable]
A: Yes, not — not only the occupation, I think something like they took away our
girls, the French.
Q: And, at several points in the book, you insert brackets that serve as pleas to your
father to choose another course, one that would have him stand up to Hitler, and
prevent him from becoming the man that he eventually became. Do you think that
he — why do you think he didn’t take this path? Was it cowardice, or a combination
of things? What — what about Hitler was so attractive to him?
Q: You have to remember the situation in Germany. Before the first World War,
Germany was really a leading nation, in industrialization. We got the most Nobel
prizes. The American students, for instance, came, studying medicine, to Germany.
We really was a brilliant country. And suddenly, everything was gone, everything
was gone. And it was, for sure, the Treaty of Versailles after the war, which made

Hitler possible. My father wrote in his youngster’s diary, Germany needs his
honor back. We need a strong person, who can fulfill this task. Maybe it’s me. But
then it was Hitler. So, the middle class in Germany, and I would say most of the
people, were really looking for becoming a nation again, full of honor. This was the
one side. And the other side was really the economical situation, which was very
bad. And there was about 10 million unemployed people, growing, and we had the
inflation. And then suddenly there were the people in the brown dress, marching in
good rows [indecipherable] in German, the word, yes. And they had the special
program, not looking to the right, and to the left, just we have our program, and
hitting everybody who was against it. For instance, the communists, yes. So this
was it — something which a lot of people attracted, in Germany. And Hitler was a
brilliant speaker. He was really very good. He wouldn’t have succeeded if at this
time was already TV, for instance. It was his personal appearance, and this very,
very strong speeches he delivered everywhere. And when he came to power, he
really managed that the unemployment was nearly gone. And there was a big, big
improvement in Germany. There’s a very famous German-Jewish historian,
Sebastian Haffner, he is dead since many years. He wrote a book about Hitler, and
he wrote in it, if Hitler would have died through a traffic accident in 1938, he
would be remembered as a great, great statesman, because he brought back Austria,

and it was a— a— now really in a good employment sitting. People, German people,
were satisfied. And on the other hand was this really, I would say tilt to
homosexuality, this relation from my father to Hitler. It was really, really, really
personal.
Q: And so, you mentioned before that y — you don’t think your father was a true
anti-Semite, the way that many of the — the original Nazis were, and it was more a
case of expediency than anything else. And — and I just wondered, does that — does
that make him better, or worse, in your eyes? That — that he didn’t have a belief, but
just sort of went along with the tide?
A: It didn’t change anything. If you are an ardent believer, an ardent anti-Semite,
you also have your 10 commandments in your head. You don’t have to kill innocent
people. And if you are —1f you are only somebody who wants to make a career, it’s
the same. For — for me it wouldn’t have changed anything.
Q: Okay. And in the book I noticed that God comes up a lot. And what — what
usefulness do you believe God served for your father? Do you think he was a true
believer in any sense, even at the end? And do you have any personal memories of
him speaking about God, before 1945?
A: No, I don’t have personal memories, but if you count how often all the speeches
of top Nazis, starting with Hitler, going down til — til my father, how oft them

mention God. You would say that was the most religious part you ever worked in
Germany. It’s always the same old trick. What you are doing, you have to — always
have to go out in your sentences. No.
Q: Yeah. And — and so, from what I’ve read on the subject, God and Nazism, the
concept of God and Nazism was really cynical and prac — and sort of a cynical in a
practical purpose. But God was not allowed to really supersede Hitler. And I’m just
wondering what are — what are your own conceptions of God, if you feel okay
talking about that. I mean, do you — are you a believer? Do you have any notion of
that, or — you know, it — unless that’s too personal.
A: Starting with my father, when my father was in prison, he used to write a lot of
letters back home. They always were read aloud from my mother, and I really was
full of contempt for those letters, because there was so much — so often mentioned
God. And as a child especially, you immediately feel that’s all a lie, that’s not really
true. And my brother Norman said, when Hitler was dead, he was looking for
another guide, and he found it in God. And myself, I was brought up very — in a
very Catholic way, because Schliersee, especially upper Bavaria was, at this time,
very Catholic. And I had my big struggle with God, because as a Catholic, you
always have those confessions, and when it came to the sixth commandment, it was
really horrible for everybody, I would say. Especially for boys. And I loved — I

never really believed in God. I never really. And in the meantime, it’s — it’s — there
is a—a very offending word in German. It’s Kasperldiada(ph), I don’t know the
American version. Yeah Kasperle(ph) is — is funny figure in — on the strings,
puppet on the strings, for children.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah. And Kasperle(ph) was a name of a little, with a big nose, who was always
very funny. And this Kasperlediada(ph) is something like a [indecipherable] for
this kind of stuff. I don’t believe in — in — in any religions. For me it’s an — it’s
inventions. Maybe human beings have always this — they wanted to have a
connection to the other world. I don’t believe in another world. Til — to the
[indecipherable] of my soul.
Q: Well, I’m right there with you, so — just a little editorializing. So, when your
book came out, Ina got into a little bit about th-th — the reception of it, and the —
what people — some people were shocked, and — and that kind of thing. Were you
surprised by the — by the reaction, and did you lose any friends, or did — did — did
your relations with — with other people that you knew change when the book came
out?
A: I was very much surprised. I was especially surprised about my fellow
journalists, because I thought everybody of the journalist know exactly why I have

written this book, because it was against [indecipherable] in Germany. But, they
also only part of the German people, so they accused me the same. The friendships
didn’t change. No, they didn’t change. But, what never came out up til now, there’s
nobody is really in private, asking me questions about this. Never. Til nowadays.
They know it’s something like — there is something ugly with Niklas. Don’t touch
it. It’s more this way.
Q: You mean, asking you questions about th-the details, or —
A: The book, about the book, about the details about comparing themselves and
their parents, and so it never came out also with my friends.
Q: And was that an ex — so you — that was an explicit motivation for you to write
the book, was it because —
A: No, not against my friends, and so. It was the silence.
Q: No, but to — the silence in Germany, that — that — that —
A: It was the only reason.
Q: — you — you wanted to — you wanted to break that, and break it in very shocking
way, In a very —
A: Not shocking. I didn’t know that’s really shocking. I was very honest when I
wrote this. So, if you are furious, your language isn’t the best one. So I kept it. The
publishing company tried to change it.

A: And I said, no, not a word. If you don’t want to print it, maybe I find another
publisher, but I will change nothing. And they — they didn’t change it, in the end.
Q: Okay. And was it a bestseller?
A: In the whole, I would say there’s two pocket editions, and about 55,000.
Q: Did you — did you receive any correspondence or fan mail that was — was really
thankful, for you to have done this?
A: Yes. There was — but was only rare in comparison to the accusation I got from
the people.
Q: So, one of the things I really liked about the book was your use of black humor.
A: Thank you.
Q: [—I-I really -I -I —I —I myself have a very difficult relationship with my
family, and that’s one way I get through it is to — to be funny about it, you know.
But one of my favorite things that you said was that you referred to ha — Hans
Frank as Rosemary’s baby, which I thought was — was great. But, can you just
speak a little bit about that, about how that helps you cope, how being able to be
funny, while at the same time talking about this really horrible subject matter.

A: I-I only can repeat, I wanted to be really honest, and I don’t — didn’t want to
make any how [indecipherable] compromise. I didn’t want to make any
compromise. But — but if you look at our history, you can’t come up with any
compromise. So, this I wanted to write, that we have to acknowledge what our
people have done.
Q: And I ha —I have to say that on — one thing that struck me also, about that use of
black humor was it — that because we work at the Holocaust Museum, and we deal
with this material every day, this horrible material, we also use that as a coping
mechanism, so I sort of recognize that in the book as well. But it — here comes a non
sequitur — so I was reading, and — and your father at one point early on, worked for
the film workers’ union?
A: Yes.
Q: And what — what — what exactly was that?
A: There was a union, it was very short. I found it in one of the document. I
couldn’t find any more about this profession.
Q: But — but, like —

A: And maybe — but it was very short time.
Q: And then — and while you were talking to Ina, you — you mentioned that your —
your father’s mother lived in Poland some of the time, is that right? She lived with
you?
A: Yes. He wasn’t quite a happy guy, my father, when he was young. His mother
left him, went with his little sister, to a new lover, to Prague. So he lived with his
father alone. And when my father became famous and rich, his mother suddenly
showed up again.
Q: And did she, that you recall, have any opinions, feelings about th-the situation in
Poland, either ger — you know, sort of writ large Germany’s actions in Poland, or
specifics of what was happening to the Polish people, and — and to the Jew? Was —
was there any kind of sense of that?
A: No. I don’t know anything special, but I know that she — a lot of letters I have of
hers to his son in — in prison, and he alw — she always defended him, as innocent.

Q: Oh, okay. Okay. And then at one point you said you — when you were talking to
Ina, you said that your mother was very practical and pragmatic. She sort of really
saw things the way they were. But then, in the book, you say — it’s just sort of one
line where you say, your mother thought that unconditional surrender was wrong,
when it came right down to it, she — I guess sh — did she think that there was some
way of preserving Germany in — in some way, or —
A: Not in a political way.
Q: Okay.
A: My mother never was a member of the party, and when the power of the Frank
family was at the highest point, she said to my father, and the other siblings were
around, and she said, I know exactly. I will — it will come the time where I will
nourish my children with my typewriter machine again. So she — and on the other
hand it’s clear, if you were — had a luxury life, and suddenly you would like to have
to go it — let 1t go on now. So she tried, but was never — she was politically not
interested. She hated the screaming speeches of my father, and she didn’t like
soldiers, all this kind of uniforms, no, she didn’t like.

Q: Yeah.
A: Erika(ph) always answers to me, yes. Sorry.
Q: Yeah, so — so I'll just go over quickly, the — the history of that, so that we have
that on the record. We found out about this from Erika(ph) Noble(ph), whose uncle
was friendly with your father at Nuremberg, right? Was he an interpreter, or —
A: No.
Q: What — what was the story on that?
A: It was Lieutenant Stein. He was a — who arrested —
Q: It — okay, th-the gu — the man you were talking about, right? So s — so, do you
know how — how it ended up with him? Did he take it from — from your father?
A: My mother was very clever. She immediately became friends with Lieutenant
Stein(ph). So my mother gave him the diary, the used diary of my father. The
original has vanished, and on every page of the reprint is printed, copyright
Lieutenant Stein, Walter Stein, which not is so really honest, I would say. He also
took away the leather coat of my father, which I bought back from an aunt of
Erika(ph) Noble(ph) for 500 dollars.
Q: Okay.

very often together with my mother.

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay. Was there any suggestion of any romantic —
A: No, no, no, he was — no, no, no.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: No, no.
Q: And so — so the way we found out about it was we got an email — I got an email
out of the blue, from Erika(ph) saying I have this footage, maybe you’re interested,
and we jumped all over it, because it was just amazing. And then, by the time we

sort of were trying to make arrangements for her to send it to us, she had sent it to
you, because she felt — and that — this makes sense —
A: Correct.
Q: — that it belonged to you, because you were the — the heir, you know. And then
we were so upset, because we wanted it, and — but understood, you know, where
she was coming from. And then, you know, many years later now, we’re — we’re
making this happen. But — but I st — I d —I hadn't quite gotten the story of — of how
it got from here to there to here, you know, so — so it’s good to have it on record, I
think. And then, to continue though, to talk about the film, which we’ll watch
tomorrow, so we can talk about it together, but the d — do you th — ha — did the film

anger, or any other kinds of emotions, or in any way changed your viewpoint on
your — about your family, seeing them in these intimate situations?

A: I was very glad to see my brother Norman with his carriage with the horses,
that’s nice. And the other pictures when they’re sitting in front of Kressendorf, and

they — everybody knew what’s — really what’s going on, and they are sitting there in
the sun. That always gave me — well, it infuriates me.
Q: Infuri — so it actually made — made it worse, in a way, to see this.
A: As in —1n the beginning of this film, there 1s this — my father 1s sitting in the
Wawel, and the adjutant is kem — coming to him, he’s — he’s ah, he’s pretending to
be a rocking — hard looking and signing something. Ooh, terrible.
Q: Yeah, yeah. And do you think that the book would have been any different, if
you had had the film to refer to? Do you think you would have added details from
the — from the film, or anything like that? No. Let’s see. So I —I find the film
personally, especially interesting for a lot of reasons, not least because I’ve now
spent a lot of time studying the concept of amateur film, home movies, and things
like that, and what it can tell us, especially how it can contradict, and complement
the official records, such as, you know, newsreels, propaganda pieces, Nuremberg
footage; all of these places where your father appears in official capacities. And yet
here he is in this amateur film — not that he’s more authentic there, but that it’s a
different view.
A: Yeah.
Q: And so you can put those two pieces together, and get a bigger picture. And, di-
di — I already asked you this question, an-and the answer is no, but — but to see these

two pieces together, does that complicate your — your view of your family life at
all?
A: No.
Q: Yeah.
A: No. I found it really interesting, this material, that I have the — especially the
scenes with the Jews.
Q: Mm-hm, that is — that’s incredible.
A: And there is one scene where —
Q: We have nothing like that. Do you remember any — were you on that trip, do you
remember that at all? No, no. So, let’s see ... I think some of these questions have
already been asked. So I — 0-okay, so were there specific turning points for you, that
you can remember, as your opinion of your father developed over time, or — and
was the process, in coming to terms with your mother and your brother and your
other siblings, a — a different process, bec — per-perhaps because they were still
alive, and he was dead?
A: Well, we start becoming older, we started to talk about it a lot. Whenever we
met, we talked about our father, and all the — more about our father, and also about
our mother. It — it was a — what it meant, which I would say it led to — to nothing.
We repeated each other. I have more and more new documents, but — but we were

still friendly, and we were really in a good mood. And I never accused them, saying
you have to change if you — and come on, and —
Q: You weren’t trying to convince them.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. It seems that —
A: And for me it’s not they have to — my siblings I have to compare with the normal
surroundings I had with other people.
Q: Yeah.
A: Nobody is really — really talking about it, and really saying something, the same
as my siblings.
Q: Right, right. And so some of the scenes in the book could be considered — I
mean, obscene is a word that’s — that has judgment attached to it, which I d —I don’t
mean to imply, but there are scenes that are — that could be called obscene, and I’m
just wondering what are — what are you trying to say to your father with that, with —
with those scenes? Are — are you trying to vent anger at him, are you trying to say —
A: Not trying, I really was angry.
Q: Right.
A: And if you are angry about one, you are losing your — your education.

Q: Okay.
A: You have to imagine that the nearer the 16" of October came, yes, when I was a
child, the more — not of my mother, but of my siblings, and the relatives, was the
urge to celebrate. To celebrate a man and the innocentess of a man which I, even
then, despised, yes, without really knowing what he has done, when I was young.
Nine, eight, 10, 11 years old. And this is a big pleasure on a little soul like mine,
when you are young. And it was just a relief, it was just a relief.
Q: A relief, okay, okay, okay, interesting. So, it seems that it’s clear that your father
constantly craved Hitler’s approval, and was always disappointed because Hitler
didn’t really have much respect for him, if any at all. And — and that reads to me, at
least, as a father-son relationship, the — the f — the father constantly disappointing
the son. And I — I wonder if that is — is a theme in the book in the sense that, you
know, this relationships between fathers and sons, is there a parallel there? Because
you — you rid — you were rejected by your father, and then you rejected your father.
But, your f— your — your father never rejected Hitler til the — til the end. And I-I’m
just wondering if you see any parallel there, 1f you see any cause — cause the whole
book seems to be about fathers and sons. Mostly about your relationship with your
— with your father, but there’s also — I kept thinking, there’s this — there’s some kind
of filial relation between Hitler and — and Hans Frank that’s not being fulfilled,

the way Hans Frank wants it to be fulfilled. So that’s not really a question, it’s just
sort of an observation, and a — and a — and — and a— I — I’m just wondering what
you think about that — that theory. You can tell me it’s bullshit, if you want.
Q: Can be — can — no, no, no, can be. Always the reader finds out something which
the writer didn’t know of, that you can read it in it. I remember writing those 12
weeks, where for me, as if my father was — would have sitten on the opposite side,
like you now, and I could tell him everything, what made me furious. This was the
situation. And whether it’s in a transitional kind of art, that something 1s reflecting
Hitler and my father, and me and my father, I really don’t know. I — I hesitant — I
had nothing in mind. When I was sitting down the first day, in the morning, I had 10
or 12 weeks holiday, so I could write it, from “Stern” magazine, and I didn’t know
exactly how to write it. I had a lot of files. And then it started with the first
sentence, and then — then I knew I had to address him personally. To you. And that
was it.
Q: That’s — I think that’s a very important point, because I think that — that really
strengthens the book and — and makes it so much more personal, that you’re — that
you’re actually addressing him. That was — that was my feeling when I was reading
it. Let’s see. Oh, one other — another thing that’s sort of related, is — is it seems to
me that you — you s — you take several opportunities to inflict posthumous pain on

your father by — by sort of constantly pointing out how little he meant to Hitler.
You know, he — he — I —I mean, you do that in general, but — but there are several
points where you’re saying, you know, you didn’t — you didn’t mean anything to
Hitler. Hitler didn’t — rejected you in the following way. So I — I thought that was
sort of an interesting device to — to — to use. Now I’m just sort of giving my own
opinion, so I’m going to try and stop that.
A: I’m thankful that you’re giving this opinion.
Q: Let’s see. Oh, so okay, this 1s — this is interesting. What — what did or do you
think about the sort of minor criminals who s — who escaped with their lives, and
even went back to normal life? Did you ever pursue any kind of — legally, or as a —
to cover them journalistically, or try to expose them?
A: No. I tried in all my articles to defend democracy, but I started as a cultural
editor, so I wa — mostly together with the German writers, and actors, and so. And
later on, when I was a war correspondent for “Stern” magazine, it was also quite
another thing to deal with. And no, it — it’s now — now I am doing it, with my last
book on this earth, about denazification. I went into the — into the archives in
Germany, too, and telling them, I don’t give you names, but you hand me over files

Furher of villages and of some areas, what they have done, and how do they defend
themselves? And it was really great.
Q: Great.
A: It’s really great what you find out. You find really out that this is very strict way
from there, to — to nowaday Germany. Because personally you can say, everybody
who is accused can defend himself, yeah? That’s for sure, that’s — that’s a human
right, inside the democracy, for instance. But how they did it, it’s so full of
cowardice, again. It’s so unbelievable. So I always said, before we had this cro —
big problem now with refugees, I used to say to the people, when they asked me, do
you think that this will happen again? And I always used to say yes. We only — if
we have about five to six years really heavy economical problems, for instance, we
will have another Hitler, and we will build up, not the gas chambers, because they
are known — too well known, but we will get other things to invent, to make the
guilty new ones dead.

A: In Germany. No, I don’t think [indecipherable] elsewhere, just in Germany.
Q: Just in Germany.
A: Because now you can see, that I never thought about refugees, because it was a
brand new problem, and you see it exactly how the silent majority of the Germans

really think, how they really behave, what — and that — wow, that I’m very much
afraid of.
Q: And — and what — have you followed at all the — the more current war crimes
trials against the, very old at this point, Nazis —
A: Yes, I followed it in the newspapers.
Q: And do you think it’s worthwhile to still be prosecuting these people?
A: For sure, for sure.
Q: Yeah. And why? What do you think is — is the benefit?
A: The benefit is that maybe a little bit more people who are reading the newspaper,
or who are attending the trial, find out what we have really done, and maybe they’ Il
think it over again, and acknowledge what we have done. But most of them are very
old now, about 95 years old, and the — it’s most — most of them are gone.
Q: Yeah, yeah. And so, turning back to your book, there’s — I think this is a really —
and this is the — the English translation, but I imagine it’s similar in — in German.
You say you already had a full tank of that poisonous bile, which for me, in my
days of the Third Reich, was turned into chocolate and lollipops. Can you tell us
what you meant by that? Does this — does this hint that you felt any guilt from
benefitting from these spoils?
A: No. As a child — today I’m always [speaks German] Ina?

Q2: I shake my head.
A: I shake my head, wondering what that I was living there, swimming on a lake of
blood, the same like my parents did. It’s just [indecipherable]. I enjoyed it very
much to have a good chocolate, to have all the toys, to — to drive in big Mercedes,
to — everybody was friendly to me, it was a very good life.
Q: And do you remember when you re — realized, or started to realize what the
trade-off was there, that —
A: It was after the war —
Q: After the war.
A: — when the first now democratic papers came out, newspapers, in Germany
called — the first one were from the American military [indecipherable] new
newspaper. And there were pictures of killed Jews, also children of my age then, six
to eight to 10 years old. And always was underlined Poland. And I thought they
were — that Poland was ours. And suddenly my father, and the whole family was
connected to these corpses. That was the first shock. The same, by the way, as
Norman told me. When Norman saw these pictures, he said to my mother, there is
no chance for Father — for our father. I think we know — now go into the dark. He
was very pessimistic when he saw the pictures.

Interview with Niklas Frank
June 6, 2016
Q: And do you think that that — that the experience that he had growing up, do you
think that contributed to him becoming an alcoholic?
A: For sure. For sure.
Q: Because he was the oldest, and —
A: Not because he was the oldest son, but he never found out a way out of this trap,
to love his father, and on the other hand acknowledging that he was a criminal. But
he was the wittiest alcoholic I ever, ever came across.
Q: So, you also write in the book that, paraphrasing, that your father stated, or made
some decree or something, that Jews were vectors of deceit, disease, and they were
subhuman. Do you think he really believed that?
A: No.
Q: And — and it was more of a — a sort of an expedient policy —
A: No, it was —
Q: A directive?
A: —T hope that Hitler reads it.
Q: Oh.
A: I hope that somebody is telling Hitler what — that I have this strongen
sentences. He was an educated man, he doesn’t only say, we have to kill the Jews
wherever we find them. He also has said this. But he tried to be, also, an educated

man in these kind of sentences. He — he didn’t say this one famous sentence also.
Somebody has told him that in — in Czechoslovakia they make a placard — placard.
Q: Mm-hm, placard, yeah.
Q2: A poster.
A: A poster telling about eight persons who has been killed as hostages, yes? And
my father said, if I would print posters for every 50 Polish people I let shoot, the
woods of Poland wouldn’t be enough to get the paper. Now that is a well-educated
sentence. It’s not, I kill much more Polish people than you kill over there,
Czechoslovakish people.
Q: Right.
A: Well that is his kind of thing, or the other example was the flat footed Indian.
Q: Right.
A: He wouldn’t have done something ugly with them. That’s great, that’s
[indecipherable]
Q: And so he — he was also in — he was educated in a lot of ways. He was a piano
player, you said. And there was something in the book, I believe, about him
composing a song about — he — he composed a song — something to do with
composing a song of — of occupying territory, or something like that? Does that —
A: Yes.

Q: Am I misremembering this?
A: No, no, it’s a poem of him.
Q: Oh, okay. Okay. And was it — was it set to music, or 1t was a poem?
A: No, no, it was not set in music.
Q: It was a poem, okay.
A: We got [indecipherable] wrote, and Hans Fitzner(ph), they wrote something
Q: Okay, okay. And so, I— ’'m-—I’m really fascinated by your mother’s fascination
with furs, and I have to, full disclosure say that part of it is because I’m a
vegetarian, and I find it very interesting that someone would be so — just meatful —
I mean, an addiction to furs, almost, it seemed like. And I — I — I just — I guess the
connection that I’m making in my mind is — 1s that he — here’s the fact that she’s
literally stealing the skin of an animal from another animal, that animal being a
human, and it seems to have a very — a v—a very deep metaphorical meaning,
somehow, to me.
A: For vegetarians.
Q: Well, for anybody, but yeah, especially for me, being a vegetarian. And — and
again here, I’m just stating my — my sort of reading of it, but I just — I just wanted to
say that, because I thought it was so interesting that she — I — an-and obviously, she
worked in the fur trade before, so she was —

Q: Right, right.
A: But, by the way, when it came to the divorce, my mother and my father had a
different lawyer for the divorce. Then the lawyer of my mother came to my father
that he wanted to — to get a fee. And my father said, I won’t pay you. My wife can
sell some of her 100 furs.
Q: Did she have a favorite type of fur?
A: No.
Q: Oh.
A: I liked very much the maulwiirfe fur, she called.

A: In—in Germany they are also nowadays, are really protected.
Q: Well, they should be. Okay, so — I’m — I’m almost done. So — so —
A: I’m not in a hurry.
Q: I— okay. By — up to page 154, there is no, that I noticed, there’s no talk of filial
love, or worship. The normal feelings of a young boy for his father, from the very —
from the young age, before you realize, before any — any child realizes that his
parents are not perfect, and that they’re flawed, and etcetera. And do you rem — do
you remember having any of those feelings for your father, before you started
realizing what was really going on?
A: No, just th — around the table —
Q: Just the chasing around the table.
A: — and — and the foam on my nose. That’s —
Q: Mm-hm. That’s it.

A: Yeah, you have — for instance, you have the foreign minister, the defense
minister, the economy minister and if you don’t have something like this, we have
no portfolio, you are just a Reichsminister.
Q: Okay. So that’s before he became —
A: Governor general, yes.
Q: Okay. And is it a— it — so it’s a lesser title, because you don’t have a portfolio.
A: It’s a— what is good money accompany with it, and when — ’33, Hitler took
over power. My father became the Bavarian minister for justice in Bavaria. He
opened up, or didn’t — did not forbid it, the concentration camp of Dachau, yes?
And he was responsible for the unification of all the country laws into the Reichs
law. And this was finished in November, December, 1934, one year later. And then,
he was — he had — he had no work to do any more. So Hitler had him — let him be
Reichsminister.
Q: Okay, okay. And, let’s see. So — and at one point in the book, you say that your
mother was disturbed by Kristallnacht, and you don’t give much more information
about that. Do you know why she would have been disturbed?

Q: Sure, sure. Okay, okay. And then — so — and — and then you also mention at one
point that Frank, obviously before the general government, worked with Roland
Freisler, and if there’s any — any legal person that Americans know about during
this period, and that’s not much, that’s for sure, it’s Freisler, because of what
happened 20" of July, and all that. So, in what capacity did he — did he work with

Freisler, and did he ha — do you remember him having a personal opinion about
him, or —
A: My — my father founded the Academy for German Right. It was also
acknowledged by Hitler, and it was public — something like university. Not
university [indecipherable]. So, therefore, he worked together with the most
important lawyers and judges. Also, around the world, he always had some
tagungen.
Q2: Conferences.
A: Conferences, thank you, conference where the international lawyers came
together to Munich, where [indecipherable]. And he was personally good friend
with Freisler. Freisler also visited us in Kresnev(ph), in Poland. That’s not my
memory, that’s — and when Norman showed up, how well educated those two
killers were. My father and Freisler immediately started to — to go on with the
conversation in Latin. Can you imagine to speak fluent Latin?
Q: Because they didn’t want Norman to understand?
A: Yes, yes.
