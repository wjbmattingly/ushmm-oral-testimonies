Not a big park, because Berlin has very big parks, that\u2019s not one- one of them. But it was like a comfortable neighborhood, and I know that Albert Einstein lived nearby somewhere.

And then I had a friend named Levia Aronfeld, who I\u2019ve seen in New York, I\u2019ve run into her, and she had -- I -- I recognized her, which was really quite something. And another person, Marion Faulk. There were quite a few. Eva Simon. I re -- just remember these names, and I did have birthday parties, yes, that I remember, had birthday parties, my mother made me birthday parties, and she had these lovely little cups and saucers, each one was different from another. I have just a couple of them left, I have them in my den, cause they -- eventually they chipped and broke, and this and that, but I li  I loved them, and it\u2019s serving -- served us cocoa in those cups, you know, each one, they were very pretty, china, you know, each one was totally different from the other. We called them Zameltussen. And maybe something will come to mind about holidays, but -- I remember a Christmas tree that she sa -- bre -- she got for when we had a maid, because she wanted it, you know, and she did it for her, we had a Christmas tree.

And he came back a day or two later, and he had tickets to -- on -- on a ship called the Startendam, and we went.

And they said that when I would learn English, that it would be sort of automatic that I would catch up with myself, which was not true. And I remember feeling very -- feeling very bad about that, you know, w-with -- with these young kids. Again, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a filmy kind of dreamy memory, seeing myself in that class, but I was not happy to be with children that were that much younger, and I didn\u2019t speak any English, and also, I don\u2019t remember other children that I was -- could be friends with, or drawn to, because there were other little German girls or boys in the class.

She said I was too young, if I wanted to come with my mother. And I said, \u201cAt this point, my mother couldn\u2019t possibly travel.\u201d And - But because of it, I think they gave it to me. And I did go on the trip to Berlin, in 1989, in the spring. March, I believe it was, before the wall came down. And it was a very interesting trip, with many -- with wonderful things that they did for us, and yet you had such -- such strange feelings, everybody did, you know. And I have a cousin who lives -- second cousin who lived in Berlin at the time, and the free time that we had, he showed me the railroad tracks, you know, over a bridge, that\u2019s where the Jews were shipped to Auschwitz from, and a little doorway that looked like a closet, you know, you\u2019d walk right by. And he said, \u201cIn there is an Orthodox shul,\u201d which you\u2019d -- you\u2019d never think there was anything in there. And told me -- So, I had very mixed feelings. At night I couldn\u2019t sleep from all the things that were -- that my -- my feelings were, you know, accosted with. And we met the mayor of Berlin, he talked to us, and there were cocktail parties. We met a senator, a woman senator, and they made these speeches, dear former citizens, and it was very strange. Very difficult to explain the -- can\u2019t say love, but the -- some kind -- some kind of memories, and yet the -- the anti-German feeling that you -- that sort of rides over everything. It -- It was very strange, and we went to see -- everybody ran to s -- to wherever they lived. And there was a man who was [indecipherable] from this area, I think he was from Maryland, and he lived near where I lived, and we went to -- by train through eastern Berlin, to where I lived, and the address existed, but not the building, so they must have kept the address, but -- you know, but it was some modern, ugly building, cause of -- obviously that whole area was bombed out, and like rebuilt."

She wanted to come with me today, you know, but that was not appropriate. But she is interested, she reads books on it. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

My other daughter is not all that interested, and also I tried, you know, even though it\u2019s German, but it is a language, when they were young, I tried to speak German to them. My mother always said it doesn\u2019t hurt to know another language, which we all know. But they really fought me on it, and I just gave up after awhile. My grandchildren are sort of interested, but I think they\u2019re interested because it\u2019s a school project, you know. I\u2019m suppose -- because they in turn are learning about the Holocaust, or in Hebrew school, or they have to do something in history, and sometimes they question me the way you\u2019re questioning me now, but not that -- not that closely, especially my youngest one, Michael. But how did -- did I speak to them about it? I -- I guess it was maybe -- they would - they did become interested, but I think they spoke more to my parents, probably, than to me. And they became interested when they were adults, but then they didn\u2019t really say much. My father didn\u2019t want to talk about it, and -- how he came here, and this and that. I -- I -- We lived in -- in Forest Hills, and I\u2019m trying to think back, I -- I don\u2019t know how much it really came up, except that the friends that I had, as I said earlier, they were from Germany as well, or German speaking, at any rate, and they would grow up hearing mixed things, but they knew a little, but nothing much has really remained, they are really just very American, Americanized."

I -- I never felt that I wanted to move there, or live there. As a matter of fact, when I was there the first time, which is -- was in 1963, after a very wonderful trip to Europe. Europe was very luxurious in 1963, and then hitting Israel, it was big disappointment. I was not very happy there. No, I - it\u2019s -- I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t have a -- I\u2019m happy that it exists, but I don\u2019t, personally no, I don\u2019t have - and I have relatives there, and I care about them, and we are in constant touch through the years, letters and sometimes phone calls.

He went two years ago, and they were lovely to them. And they stayed with them when they had time to visit people on their team tour, each one. And they were saying that I should come, we talked on the phone a couple of weeks ago, that I should come, they have a new house, I should stay with them. And I\u2019m considering it, maybe, to go back to Israel. But otherwise -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really because of them, and to see Isra -- and then my other experience was in 1993. I\u2019d had the bad luck to go on a poor tour -- poorly organized tour, it really wasn\u2019t a tour at all, and I -- if it weren\u2019t for my cousins there, it would have been a pretty disastrous trip, cause I was really on my own. It was sold as a tour, but it was -- when you got there, it was really like a day tour.
