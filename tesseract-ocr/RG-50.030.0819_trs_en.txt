July 14, 2015
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Mr. Robert Max, on July 14", 2015, in Summit, New Jersey. I’m very grateful to
you, Mr. Max, for agreeing to speak with us today, and I want to make a note at the
beginning of this interview, that you are doing so barely a week after you have
buried your wife and partner of 67 years, and I — if —I would like to begin the
interview with your thoughts of why you decided to do this at this particular
moment, when such — when you’ve suffered such a loss, and then we’ll continue
with our usual interview.
Answer: Mm-hm. The loss of my wife was severe. It was a shock to me, but it was
immediate. My wife was my partner in everything that I did, my entire life, for 67
years. She would have wanted — she would have wanted to be here, she would have
wanted to see the interview going on, because she knew all of the experiences that I
will talk about. And — and that bolstered me, and I — I decided that yes, she would
definitely want me to do this, and thus — I did not make the call, but I might have
made, to you, Ina.
Q: Yeah.
A: And in the mem — in memory of her, and — and I’Il be thinking of her while ’'m
talking with you —

go forth, even at such a moment, so —
A: Thank you.
Q: So we’re going to start our interview, like we do, at the very beginning. I want to
find out about your life growing up, before you joined the army, and then we’ll go
into all of these experiences, that are the core of the story.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: So the first questions are very simple. Could you tell me your name at birth, and
your date of birth?
A: Mm-hm. My name was Robert Roger Max, and I was born on July 10", 1923.
Q: Where?
A: In—1in Newark.

July 14, 2015
Q: Okay. And was your family name always Max, or was it shortened from
something else?
A: There’s a lot of question — questioning and doubt about it. Some tell me that it
wasn’t Max, some tell me it was Marx, and I learned just a few years ago, that it
was really Manczyk, m-a-n-c-z-y-k, and we had relatives in Brazil, the Mancezyk
family.
Q: Wow.
A: So, it was a revelation to me, but all the years I’ve lived with Max, so I couldn’t
see changing it, so it remains.
Q: You stayed that way, yeah. When did your family come over from Europe?
A: My —I don’t really remember wa — I don’t know. I don’t know when they came
over. But I know my grand — on my — on my father’s side, my grandparents came
from Poland — I’m just [indecipherable] my mother’s family came from France,
and my in-laws came from Poland. Ptezuk(ph), Poland.
Q: Ptczuk(ph).
A: Ptezuk(ph), p-t-c-z-u-k, something like that.
Q: Okay.
A: Tough to pronounce, even tougher to spell.

July 14, 2015
Q: Yeah. Well, you know, so many of these places, particularly in eastern Europe,
have five iterations of — of the same name — I mean, the same village, or the same
town, the same place, in different languages.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: Whether it would have been Polish, or Yiddish, or Russian, or — or German, or —
or something else. They all, you know, me — very small places often had five
names. So, Ptezuk(ph) —
A: Ptezuk(ph).
Q: — who knows how else it’s called, and where it would be.
A: Yes. Well, my wife Shirley sp-spent years, years, trying to trace where it is. She
never had found it yet, so conceivably, it doesn’t even exist any more. But she
remembers her mother telling her —
Q: Yeah?
A: — that’s where they were — that’s where they were from.
Q: Tell me a little bit about your own family that you were born into. Did you have
brothers and sisters?
A: I had an older brother, who was eight years older, and a sister who was two years
younger.
Q: Okay, so he was born in 1915, your brother?

A: Essentially, they delivered milk to homes, and to stores, in the days when people
got home — milk at home.
Q: How cool. I remember hearing about those, yeah.
A: Yeah, yeah, yes. And he was president of the co — of the company.
Q: Okay, so it was his.
A: Pardon?
Q: It was his company.
A: It wa — it was not — it was — there were five brothers. His grandfath — my
grandfather, his father, founded the company, and then turned it over to the boys,
and bought himself a fancy Cadillac, hired a chauffeur, and spent the rest of his life
traveling America. And the boys worked hard.
Q: Knew how to live.
A: He did know how to live.
Q: Did you have — did you know him?
A: Yes, I—I di-did, briefly, and just sparingly. I just b-b-barely got to — to — to — to
know him. He died at a very early age; he never reached 50.
Q: Oh wow.
A: Well, he lived so well, you know, he smoked, drank, and — and rode in his
Cadillac.

Interview with Robert Max ”
July 14, 2015
Q: Wow.
A: Yeah.
Q: Tell u — tell me a little bit about — about the home you were born into. Describe it
somewhat, you know, was it a house, what kind of a place was it? What are some of
your earliest memories? Tell me about those.
A: [ll tell you the address, it was 329 South Orange Avenue in Newark, New
Jersey.
Q: Okay.
A: And it was a—a-—a tenement house. There were two may — two families. We
occupied the first floor, and — and when I say tenement, there was a house adjoi —
immediately adjoining it. One of my father’s brothers, my uncle, was in the next
apartment.
Q: Was it a brownstone looking kind of place?
A: No, they weren’t brownstones, just wooden shingled homes.
Q: Okay.
A: Not particularly fancy, but that was it, and we were on a major thoroughfare,
with trolley lines, so forth. And the house was directly across the street from a
reservoir, which year — years later, when I went back to see if the home was still
there, the home was, but the reservoir was gone.

Interview with Robert Max "
July 14, 2015
Q: Wow.
A: They had built homes on the other side of the street.
Q: But while it was a reservoir, was it accessible to people?
A: Not really, because it was a — a county reservoir, providing water for the citizens.
We just knew it was there, but all we saw were brick and stones and mortar, and we
knew inside was water. That was about it.
Q: What about your parents’ own home? How many rooms did it have?
A: It’s hard for me to remember, I was very young when we moved from there. But,
in fact, I don’t really rem — I think there were two bedrooms, there was a living
room, there was a dining room, and that was — and the bathroom, a bathroom, and
that was about it.
Q: Okay. It sounds very modest for the owe — well, the part owner, partial owner of
a company.
A: Well, the — it was not really a big business, and we have five brothers all
working together, they all drain off the business. So we — let’s say friends,
acquaintances, always thought they were wealthier than they really were. So we
lived in a — yes, in a modest home.
Q: And you say you moved from there at some point?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Robert Max "
July 14, 2015
A: We moved from there to another section in Newark, the — the westernmost —
most section, in the Vailsburg section of Newark, which is bordering on the town
of South Orange. And I will tell you, when we moved, it — well, the family got
together, had a going away party. We were still in Newark, but they considered that
so distant, that they had to have a party for us.
Q: So the rest of the uncles stayed on — there?
A: They remained in — no, they moved to the suburbs, too.
Q: Okay.
A: It was very common in Newark during those years, for je — for Jewish families
in particular, to move, when they’re able to, to move to the suburban areas. And
each of the — as I recall, each of the brothers did move to a different suburban town
in New Jersey.
Q: Did — was the strai — did you live — in the original place, was the street that you
lived on almost exclusively Jewish? Were you in a Jewish neighborhood, or was it
mixed?
A: It was totally mixed.
Q: Okay.
A: I—I never lived in the Jewish neighborhood. I was going to say I never had the
privilege of living in a Jewish neighborhood. I suppose I would have liked it. But

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Robert Max "
July 14, 2015
no, we — we were in mixed neighborhoods, where our neighbors were — I know a
number of them were Italians, and Poles. I don’t recall if there were any Jews even,
in the area where we were. [indecipherable]
Q: So you could have been the only family.
A: Hm?
Q: You could have been the only Jewish family.
A: Just the — the next door — the house next door, as I mentioned before, was wa —
one of my uncles. And we were the — I think the only Jewish people in the area,
yeah.
Q: How old were you when you an — when you moved?
A: I try to remember, but it was probably kindergarten age, because I remember I
entered another school. No, I do — no, I did, before we moved, I did have
kindergarten 1n a local school there. So I would — would have been what, six or
seven when we moved.
Q: And in that — in those first six or seven years, are there any incidents from your
childhood that you still remember today, that kind of stand out?
A: Yeah, one that I keep — keep thinking about, certainly around Christmastime.
Now, we were observant, we belonged to a Reform congregation, but my father
always insisted as dressing up as Santa Claus.

July 14, 2015
Q: Did he really?
A: Yes. And he — and I — and I re — remember. There was an alleyway along —
alongside of the house, and I remember his going up that alleyway, going, ho, ho,
ho, ho, ho, imitating Santa. And — and gifts and all that. So, really in a — and — and
it was a very strange thing, because we were very closely related to the — to a
synagogue, and yet, we observed Christmas.
Q: Did you know it was him, or did you think it was Santa?
A: Oh, it took me a while to get to know it, but after a while I knew it, and, you
know, he was exposed, and he stopped doing it after that, but —
Q: Yeah.
A: You know, when I was — when — in the very, very beginning, I — I wasn’t quite
sure, but after a while, it was — became obvious. Were —
Q: Well, did it — did it feel strange to be observing Christmas when you were little,
or this is something you just think about now, as an adult?
A: It was just a natural thing.
Q: Okay.
A: Because we were in that kind of a neighborhood, and everybody else observed it,
and so we did, too. Even though we, again, continued to practice our Judaism, we
still observed, to be part of the neighborhood.

July 14, 2015
Q: What’s your first memory, or maybe amongst your first memories, of going to a
synagogue, of becoming part of the community, the Jewish community?
A: Mm-hm. Well, going to synagogue, we belonged to a congregation in Newark,
New Jersey, B’Nai Jeshurun, was extreme Reform. A very, very, very li-liberal
congregation. And I remember my parents going there, and then when I was old
enough, I started to go there, too. But we moved before I — there was anything
significant, but we maintained our membership in that congregation. It was on High
Street in Newark. And I don’t remember anything particular about — about it, just
that my mother was very particular about Friday nights, and Saturday mornings.
And people don’t always think that, well, you were a Reform Jew, so you’re not
that ritualistic, I mean, you’re not that tied to it. But m-m-my mother was.
Q: Yeah.
A: And that carried on through my youth. Friday nights were always — always
sacrosanct. You went to temple Friday night, and that’s what I did.
Q: And that’s some — that’s something that — that Just stayed constant from your
very earliest years?
A: From my earliest years. As a matter of fact, when we moved to the Vailsburg
section, I was athletic, and I was part of an athletic group. Just a group that
eventually just — was just below semi-professional. There were oth — there was only

one other Jew in the group, the others were all Christians. There were Poles and
Italians. This is in the Vailsburg section of Newark. They knew, though, and they
respected the fact that Friday nights I would not hang out with them at the local
soda shop. And they respected that very, very highly, as I respected their Christian
faith, too. And I — well, some — some — some — sometime later, when it came time
for my first Bar Mitzvah — this is something that I — I — I remember so vividly
because it was so unusual. I invited all of the — the athletic group to my Bar Mitzvah
service. And when I say the temple B’Nai Jeshurun was ultra, ultra liberal, the Bar
Mitzvah boy did not read from the Torah. All I did was prayer, the prayer before
and after the reading of the Torah, and a speech. Now it’s Saturday morning, and
I’m at my Bar Mitzvah, and I — I get up to make a speech. And I do, the typical
boys’ Bar Mitzvah, so today I am a man, etcetera. And when I finish — these guys,
there must have been 10 or 11 of them, they got up, and they started to clap. Yo,
Bobby. They cheered, they whistled. The decorum, mostly on a Saturday morning,
elderly women, very reserved, and so forth, they looked, and I saw the heads — I
could see from the — from the bema, the heads of the people just dropped, oh my
God. They’re just wa — wa-waving their heads from side to side. They had never
seen a demonstration like that before. However, as I say, my — my friends,
Christians, were very ver — very, very well aware that Friday night I would not hang

out. But I — as — in recip — reciprocating for their coming to my Bar Mitzvah, I
attended Catholic midnight mass —
Q: Oh, did you really?
A: — that year, yes, I went to the Sacred Heart church in Vailsburg section in
Newark, to be, because they were all Christians, and they were there at the church,
so I said, I will come to your church now. And I did.
Q: That’s a very unusual story.
A: Its a—
Q: You know, it’s a very unusual sort of ex — set of experiences for the early 1930s,
or the mid-1930s.
A: It —1t would — I — I think it was probably unique, because most everybody I
knew, as — over the years, as I’ve grown up, most everybody I knew, certainly in the
Jewish world, that ber — that grew up in Newark, grew up in the Weequahic
section of Newark, which was — I — I — I think of it as a rich man’s ghetto, because
it was all Jewish, but there were nice homes, and well-to-do people. Others that
were not well-to-do, too, but it was preserved very, very well, as long as they were
there. So I always felt that I missed out on something that was significant. I never
had — I — I—I did not live in wa — in a Jewish section, did not live near Jewish
people, but I never had any acts of anti-Semitism, despite the fact that I — I evolved,

Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
circu — circulated in a Christian world. Just never ran into it. And somehow I — I felt
even deprived, because of the experience. You have to know what anti-Semitism is,
you have to feel it yourself, I’ve — I’ve always believed, and I fe — I didn’t feel it. It
wasn’t until later on in life that I really got to understand it. Well, I studied it more,
and became active in community life things. But no, I was deprived of one of the — I
shouldn’t call it a joy, but one of the experiences that many young Jewish boys went
through.
Q: Well, it’s a — it’s a nice — it’s — as deprivations go, this 1s probably one that one
would want to have, you know?
A: As nice a one as I could have wanted, yeah.
Q: Yeah. Let’s talk a little bit about family dynamics. Your — you had an older
brother, eight years older. Wha — what was your relationship with him like?
A: Like father and son. My father worked very often in the eve — evenings. And
Lester — eight years older, it was a pretty big spread. He took over as — as my
father. At the age of three — I have pictures of that remarkable — he bought me a
New York Yankee baseball uniform; cleats, a glove, bat and ball.
Q: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.
A: And he wa — he wou — the house that we lived on, that I mentioned, on South
Orange Avenue in Newark, had a backyard, and there was a fence separating it

July 14, 2015
from the house behind. He pitched to me. Now, I shouldn’t say — and — and I swung
the bat, but really, he was a good pitcher, and he would hit the bat. He kept my
batting average — and the best that I can remember, one season he had me batting
.575. Now that was even bigger — much, much bigger than Ted Williams .400
batting average, you know”? And he kept record of homeruns, the fence was about
maybe a hundred feet away, li— and so, every now and then he would hit the bat
perfectly, and I would swing a little bit, and we go over the fence. So we kept my
homerun record, and all of that. He taught me baseball, took me to Rupert Stadium
in Newark, the trolley was right across the street from our house, took us down to
Newark, and followed the New York Yankee, the farm team, the Newark Bears.
But — so he — he re-really — I — I—I guessed, introduced me to sports, all sports, and
I think acted very much like a — a —a father. When he —
Q: He sounds like a wonderful older brother.
A: It wa — 1t was — it was a — just a marvelous rel-relationship. And during the war —
you know, World War II was partially — par-partially financed by the American
people. There were signs all over, buy war bonds. And so he bought war bonds for
me. I was just — just a young kid yet. So I already had war bonds going for me. He
was that —
Q: When did he buy them? What year would have this been?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Robert Max "
July 14, 2015
A: Oh, that would have been — well, surely after war was de-declared, so the early —
Q: It — after 41.
A: Huh?
Q: After °41.
A: After ’41, right.
Q: Okay.
A: And — and the bonds were av-available, so he bought some. And when he went
into the service too, he bought bonds, even he had allocation taken out of his pay,
which was very moderate, and he was married at the time, and he had an allocation
taken out in war — in bonds bought for me. Very, very strong relationship.
Q: What els — what did he teach you? What do you — what are some of the — you
know, clearly, he showed an absolute adoration of a little boy —
A: Mm-hm.
Q: — to buy him a baseball suit —
A: Yeah.
Q: — and — and make sure that he bats, and — and builds his confidence, and — and
has a great homerun score, and a batting average score. What kind of a personality
was he, and what are the things that he bequeathed to you from that?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
A: Well, try — he was a — he was basically a — a good person, so what he was doing
for me, I don’t know that he did a great deal in philanthropy, or charity, and all that,
but he was just basically very good. Had strong, strong ties to family. And he
remembered my birth, which was in a — it was a private home, they called it Essex
General Hospital, but it was somebody’s home, and I was born in a bedroom in
that home. And he reminded me time and time again, that he saw me at birth, lying
— just — just after birth, lying out in the hallway of that house, in a leather covered —
lea-leather seat, a chair, a little — he said, you were about this big. He used to
describe it to me often. So, I — I guess in a se — in — 1n a sense, he — he — he was
there at the very, very beginning, and just — I was the first child after him, and he
took a responsibility. He was eight years old at the time, and was mature enough to
say, this is my little brother. And somewhere within him, he must have said, and
I’m going to see that he — I’m going to care for him, cause Papa’s not around
enough, and Mama has her things to do. But I’m going to see that he gets well cared
for, and he did, the rest of his life.
Q: Wow. I would usually save this for another part of our interview, but I’d like to
talk to you about your brother a little bit more. You say he all — I’d like to find out
what his destiny was. So, let’s start with the war.
A: Mm-hm.

Q: Let’s say, by that point he was an adult, and he was married.
A: Right.
Q: Did he volunteer, or was he drafted? Wha — how did that — what happened?
A: Okay, he volunteered.
Q: Okay. And where did he serve?
A: He served the European theater, and I— I —I—I possibly should be telling you
this later on, because in sequence — it’s out of sequence.
Q: Okay.
A: But I think it’s — it’s more important that it relates to the kind of person he was
[indecipherable]. If I get into th — in — in— I’m —I’m jumping ahead very far, I —
Q: Would you — would you prefer that we wait a little bit? Because I do want to find
out what happened to him, but we can do it now, we can do it later.
A: Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah, I think ma — maybe we — sequentially — al-although —
sequentially, I think we’ll hold it until later on.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: And —

Q: Okay, then in that case we’ll hold on to it.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: Can we break, just for a second? [break] So here we are, we were talking about
— we were talking about your brother Lester.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: And we’ll postpone some of the discussion on what his experiences were, for a
little bit. Let’s go back to talk about some of your other family members. You had a
little sister.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: Her name was Ruth.
A: Right.
Q: And, tell me a little bit about Ruth, and about the relationship that you guys had.
A: We grew up as typical brother sister. She had her group, I had my group.
Q: Did she tag along behind you?
A: No, she didn’t. She was independent. She had, as I say, her own group of young
ladies, and I had my athletic group. They didn’t — they didn’t mix, really. We were
two different — different types of — of groups. So I really didn’t have much
interaction with her. We were, in a sense, a close-knit family, but not that we played

together. We went together. We would make many trips to Atlantic City, Mother,
Father, Sister and me, but not my older brother. Again, eight years older, he was
like in another world, and as I mentioned, he was like my — like a father to me. So
he had his activities going. He went to college long before I was eligible for that,
and so we — we were not that close, other than the fact that, as I mentioned, he was
so, So close to me. So, we had our relationship, and my sister was pretty much out
of — out of it.
Q: What about your parents now? Tell me a little bit about their personalities. What
kind of people were they?
A: I said before that my father was president of the company. He was appointed so
by his father, because he was the oldest. He was not a leader type to the younger
brothers. Plus, a bookkeeper really ran that business. My father was content to fix
milk boxes with hammers and nails. So it was in — it was in a — an uncomfortable
role for him, and he signed checks as president of the company, and people outside
in the — at our Jewish world, knew that he was president of the company, and there
was prestige that went with it, and all, but act — in actuality he did not play that
active arole. When I say that my brother took over because my father was often
away at night, he was running trucks. He was delivering milk.
Q: Your father?

A: My father, yes, he’s president of the company, but he da — so, he was just a
different kind — different kind of per — of a person, and —
Q: Was he a quiet person?
A: Yeah, he was pretty quiet. I wouldn’t say substantially so, but you know, not a
boisterous kind of person, not a happy-go-lucky, jovial type person. Pretty sedate.
But, I always thought, a good father. He — he always did things for me. We had
special trips we — 1n those days, going — take — going out and — in the evening,
getting in the car, because we didn’t have air conditioning, you want to cool off
during the summer, you take a ride in the car. We used to go down route 20 — it was
route 22 then, it’s route 29, national, now. And route tw — 222, I’m sorry, national
now, we used to call it route — local, New Jersey, route 29. And it was called — I
called it the hamburger route, because my father used to put us in the car on a
summer evening, and go down the road, and there was a hamburger stand down
there, and I liked the hamburgers. To get me to go to Friday night services, after
services, there were two places we went on Friday nights. One was Eddis’s(ph), a
malted shop in Newark, and the other was a pizza — I can’t remember the name of
it, star. Star Pizzeria. There is one today, it’s in Orange, but it’s not the same
family. Star Pizzeria. And because my father helped them with a connection, that
they got their liquor license, they used to have — Friday nights, after service, we’d

go into the kitchen, these big, huge ovens, and they were cooking, making these
pizzas there. And they were pizzas not quite the way they’re made today. They were
made oh, olive oil, and spices and tomato — tomato — just — just —
Q: Sounds delicious.
A: And very, very thin, very thin crust. But anyway, that’s — that’s the kind of
relationship we — we had, in taking — so he was good to the family. Took us fairly
frequently to Atlantic City for a weekend. I loved staying in hotels. Sunday
morning breakfast was just great. So he was — he was good to us.
Q: And — and your mom? Tell me a little bit about her, what was she like?
A: Again, a— a— avery good mother. Wonderful cook. Really cared for her — her
children. She used to take me and my sister to Newark, downtown Newark
frequently, when Newark was one of the great cities in America. She would take
us there for lunch, to a movie. There were more movie houses then, than there are
today, and all that. But I would say both, they were both really, really good parents
to us. One thing that I’ve always regretted. If they wanted to talk so that we didn’t
understand, they’d talk Yiddish. And —
Q: That was going to be one of my questions.
A: Yeah, they talked Yiddish, but never enough in our presence, for us to acquire.
And I always — always felt that in a — in a sense, they let us down, because they

I had to learn it mostly in my own way, starting to read newspapers —
Q: And did you?
A: — listening to radio. Pardon?
Q: And did you?
A: I did. Oh, I— I - at a pri — fairly early age, I st — I did read newspapers, more
than just the comics, and I did listen to — I listened to radio — radio news broadcasts.
But there were a lot of — a lot of things that I always begrudged the fact that they
didn’t admit — they weren’t conscious — conscious of it. They could have instructed
us on a lot of things. I usually go to the polls during elections and all that, and we
were never taught politics. I always wished that, you know, they — they knew no —
something about — we had a Jewish mayor at one point, Mayor ma — Meyersee(ph)
— whose name — well, slips me for the moment.
Q: Mm-hm, in the 30s.
A: But anyway, the only — the only Jewish mayor in newar — in Newark’s history,
and all the — so my father knew some of these people, but there were never any
introductions, never any background with these people, never what the political
scene was like, and so forth.

Q: Okay. And what — was that because your parents didn’t have that kind of
interest, even though they might have had the connection?
A: I don’t think it was the interest, I th — I think it was just not the awareness.

Very, very different, as the decades went on, parents, you know, dinner table, you

somewhere around 90, which was extremely high in those day —
Q: Yeah.
A: — in those days. She — she never learned to read or write English. She — she

A: English? Yes, yeah. She acquired enough. Not a very, very good English, but
couldn’t — could not write. And I remember Shirley, my wife, getting a letter once
from her. It was in hebe — it — it was in Yiddish, and she had to get somebody to
interpret it for us. So, she could write in Yiddish, read Yiddish, whatever reading
she did. Her produ — her dominant responsibility was running a household, and a —
and a kitchen for, I think it was 10 to 20 people. The people who wor — my

owned what — a good — big part of what became Irvington Center.
Q: Oh, wow.
A: And we always begrudged his — his act-activities, his — his traveling, and all that.
What he did was to sell off parcels of land there, that later would have enriched his
family so much, because it grew in value. He kept selling off parcels of land so he
could go with his re — maroon Cadillac, and the chauffeur, and travel all over the
country.
Q: And your grandmother, or not?
A: But — but she, now she — she had to carry the burden, because all the people they
had working on the farm, and the — and the — the brothers and sisters, she cooked.
She was a marvelous, marvelous cook, but that’s what she did, virtually all day,
cooking and cleaning and laundry. That was her life.
Q: Oh my God, it’s a hard life.
A: Yes, yes, but sh — physically very, very active, until they had a — they had a
house at — in Bradley Beach, New Jersey, in addition to living here, on
[indecipherable] Street in Newark. They had a house, and a small house in the
back. Ma — the — my grandmother ha-had the — her house, the families used to come
down and occupy the big house for weekends, and so forth. She did all the cooking,

she did all the cleaning, she did everything herself. There were never any help. I
don’t think any vi — any of the daughters or daughters-in-law even helped. All of
that. And her career, her active, physical career, doing things like that, ended when
one of her sons, one of my uncles, drove down to Bradley Beach, and drives into
the driveway, and there is this house in the back. She’s up on the roof nailing
things. She’s almost 90 na — 90 at that time, well into her 80s, and she was nailing.
And he said, Mom, Mom, come down from there, you know, don’t ever — and they
prohibited her from doing anything like that. She deteriorated after that. But she
was always regarded as a great, great lady. Without, again, the s — the reading —
writing skills, and the reading, any of that —

the Kahns, they’re k-a-h-n, the grandparents, they lived on Chestnut Street. I

business on farms, and all their sons were in the cattle business, except one, A-
Aaron, who was in the milk business, 1n competition, in a sense, with my father.
But he used to drive up to our house. I mentioned that I — I was born on South
Orange Avenue in Newark. And fairly often wou — I would look out the window
and see a horse drawn wagon, big milk — big bottle of milk painted on it, and all
that. That was Uncle Aaron, would come by on his route, would come by, stop in
and have a cup of coffee with us. And after, he became — no education, but there’s a
painting in my bedroom that he did. After he retired from that activity, he became a
painter, and did marvelous flower paintings, and all that. So, that was the —

my uncles, and all. But they, every — every day, every day, the bi — the bi — the big
deal at the dairy would be, oh, the trailer’s coming, the trailer’s coming. This huge
trailer would come from upper New York state, and back — back in, and unloading,
it was unloading all the milk, came from upper New York state.
Q: Did they process —
A: Because the farm was gone from Irvington, so they had to get it from a place
upstate.

him much of a chance. They wa — the uncles were — were not kind, not particularly
congenial toward him, and we — my brother and I talked later on, and said, if they —
if they had, if the brothers had had the sense enough to allow my brother and me to
come in, the next generation, and run the business, it would have been a successful
business. But when you — when you have brothers in the business, and they spend a
good part of their time arguing or fighting with one another, and who’s taking more
vacation time, and tho — those kinds of things happen there. And unfortunately, it
didn’t become a big business.
Q: Yeah. Well, you know, it also depends on — on the f — the — the previous
generation from that too, you know. If your grandfather wasn’t really interested in
making sure that things were divided equally, that kind of set things up too,
sometimes.
A: Yes. Yeah.
Q: Okay, let’s move onto a few other things. This world that you describe, sounds
actually like a lovely world, in — in New Jersey at that time, you know, of growing
up with this large family, and — and a wonderful older brother, and — and warm
parents, and so — at home, were discussions about what was going on in Europe
ever part of the conversation? I mean, the large things. When Hitler came to power
in 1933, you were 10 years old.

Q: Do you ever remember your parents, or anyone in the family making any
remarks about that?
A: As I mentioned earlier wa — that was one of the things that I regretted; we did not
talk about world affa — affa — affairs. And I was not introduced to — to that until I
was ol — a little older, and able to read the papers ma — myself. No, we didn’t talk a
lot about what was going on in Europe, and as I say, I wish — I wish we had done a
little bit more of that.
Q: Was it — was there any talk anywhere? Like in school, or in your world? I guess
I’m trying to get a sense of how did events that were going on in Germany, when
did they become part of at least something you were aware of?
A: It’s very vague with — in my mi — my memory, very vague. And the best I can
think of, probably not until high school, til I got into high school, that I started to
become interested in world affairs, started to read newspapers re-regularly.
Q: Yeah, that would have been —

my — on my own, in newspapers.
Q: Did you have a radio at home?
A: We did have radio. We listened to radio a great deal. I very often listened to Joe
— Joe Louis’ bouts. And oh, he was amazing. I — I— I think about that, when people
— when we talk today about — when those days we didn’t have TV. We certainly
didn’t have computers and all that. What did you do? Well, we listened to radio.
What — what — what — what did you see? We didn’t see. We saw in our own minds.
And I —I fought every round with Joe Louis in those bouts, just listening on a big
box radio, and I could point — the announcers had to be very good, and they were.
And I could really, really feel that I saw Louis in those great bouts, in the Louis —
Braddock — or mac — Max Baer, Jimmy Braddock championship fight. Well,
Max Baer was our hero. Remember, he wore the Jewish star, and — and he was a
braggadocios ki — kind of guy. Glamorous sor — sort of. And then defi — defeated by
this small time boxer, really, from New Jersey. But, listening on radio, it was — it
was — it was very real, and we could see it — you know, we didn’t — listening now 1s
quite different, because we ha — we’ve been exposed to TV. But, it was real.

Q: This — sou-sound has a magical quality.
A: It has. It has. And even ba-baseball games, except for one incident I remember, a
baseball announcer — and you know, President Reagan wa-wa-was a baseball a-
announcer, sportscaster and all. But the Newark Bears were the yank — New York
Yankees farm team, A number one farm team. They had an announcer by the name
of Earl Harper. And I used to listen to baseball — again, my — I mentioned my
brother had really introduced me to baseball, maybe a New York Yankee. And so I
used to listen to the Yankee game certainly, but I listened to the Newark Bears
games, too, and Earl Harper was the announcer. They had to describe what was
going on in the field, to gi — give you on — the only representation you could get,
what, literally, was happening. So I remember Earl Harper, I sit down, and I was
listening, he said, the si— the wind-up, the pitcher wind-up, the stretch, the pitch,
and there goes a booming drive, going — look a — deep, deep center field, and — and
— and a— and Roy Schalk steps back on the grass and takes it. Roy Schalk was
second baseman. So that description of this long, long drive going out to center
field, was really caught by the second baseman, who just stepped back onto the
grass, and all that. So sometimes you got vivid descriptions that weren’t very real.
And they could color them if they wanted to, and some of them did, or they could

ma-make errors, and sometime they did that too, but — but anyway, radio was real to
us.
Q: And so, were there other types, non-sports programs that the family listened to?
A: Yeah, I think my mother had her favorite morning drama — drama. So morning,
when we’re cooking, preparing lunch, and preparing for the evening meal, there
were — there were drama shows on radio, and she, I think, used to listen to those. I
used to listen to a lot of music. I became a musician. And I got fascinated with Big
Band Swing, which was the music of that era. So I listened to a great, great deal of
that.
Q: What about December 7", 1941?
A: Yeah. All I remember about that is the president’s speech, the da — the day aft —
after.

ambassadors, Nomura, began with a C, and an N, and a C, but the two Japanese
were in the White House at the time. They knew the attack was coming, as it was
reported later on, and they knew it, and they were negotiating with the president.
So, it was really a dastardly, dastardly act. Their planes were already on the way to
Pearl Harbor, and they were still talking with the president of the United States,

what we did get, on newscasts, was, you know, it was sufficient for us, at that time.

A: Mm-hm.
Q: That’s important to know. That’s a difference between today’s world, and — and
— and the one 60, 70 years ago.
A: Oh, a very different world, yes.
Q: Yeah. And one other question that I’ve got is background question. What kind of
image did you have in your mind, of what Europe was, based again, on family.
Because most Americans, when they came, most Americans at that time, would not
have been immigrants from the second or third generation, they would have been
earlier, you know?
A: Mm-hm.
Q: And Europe is very distant. What was — how was Europe painted for you, given
that your mother comes from western Europe, and your father’s family came from
eastern Europe?
A: Even though they came from there, I had no — no knowledge really, of central
Europe, of eastern Europe. To me, Europe was Paris and London, Spain. Strictly
the western — the nations in Europe. But just — just Europe seemed so distant. It

was another world. Today it’s very different, it’s in our — it’s in our backyard, and
you travel to it all the time. But it was very, very rare for anybody to travel even, to
Europe. So, it didn’t play much of a role in our lives. Just a fascination, something
out there that’s very alluring to us, but we’d — we didn’t think, we didn’t travel the
way people travel today. You wouldn’t think of traveling to Russia, my gosh.
Q: Travel from Russia.

Q: Yeah.
A: — not there.

Q: How does your life continue? You’re in high school at that time, is that correct?
A: Mm-hm, right.
Q: How were those last years of high school, and what — what was going on with
you?
A: Well, obviously, I was aware that the Japanese had struck, and we were in a war
in the Pacific islands. It didn’t affect me very, very much, until, you know, four
days later, December 11, 1941, that Adolf Hitler declared war on America. Now it

was a different — different story. First of all, Hitler, Nazi — Nazi Germany, Jews,
all of that began to register on me, as I — as I mentioned, I read newspapers, so I
knew what was going on. That started to register. In 1941, I graduated high school,
then 1942, headed for college.
Q: Where?
A: September of 1942, I guess that’s when it was. Pretty sure. And I was what, 19 at
the time. Oh, I’m s —I’m sorry. My first year, I did not go to Ohio University. My
first year wa — I went to New York University. It was convenient, I didn’t have to
go traveling any place. I could just — oh, about a half mile from my home, I could
get on a bus, and travel to Newark, take a train into New York, and I went to New
York University, the fi-first — first year. And that’s when I read newspapers a great
deal, during — during travel to and from the city. And that’s when I — I knew what
was going on, and — with Nazis. I knew the concentration camps were be —
beginning, Hitler’s plan of the — his gru — his — his book.

into the office, and there was a — a man leading the music. And you know, they had
a band, a swing band, and his name was Jack Leonard. He had been with the
Tommy Dorsey orchestra. He preceded Frank Sinatra as the vocalist for that
orchestra. So he — like ma — like so many of the musa — musicians, so many, many
of them, the bandleaders and all, they all volunteered, and went in the service.
Glenn Miller, you know what happened to him.

A: Oh yeah, yeah. Glenn Miller, of course, had probably the most — certainly one
of the most popular bands. We called them swing bands, dance bands. They had one
of the most popular ones, had a unique sound, that he created for his orchestra. And
he — I believe he volunteered. He became a captain, then a major, and he was
leading — he had a— a— a World War II band, a counterpart of what he had in
civilian life. And they played some of the same music, again. And he used to travel
to the bases, where the troops were, overseas, and play concerts, jazz co — swing

concerts for them. Glenn Miller disappeared in a flight from Great Britain, over to
Normandy. They never, never di — were — never discovered, what happened. He —
he was off, they were going over to France to entertain the troops, and the plane
disappeared. And there are many, many stories and beliefs as to how it disappeared,
but somewhere over the English channel, Glenn Miller —
Q: Disappeared.
A: — was hit, and was — and disappear — dis-disappeared. But my experience in the —
in music, some of the — some of the members may have been from his band, too, but
I — when I ca — when I came — oh, I didn’t — didn’t tell you how I got to be there. I —
I played in local bands here. So I played clarinet and saxophone. So I get there, and
I’m called into the office. And they tell me that Jack Leonard would like to see
you. I says, why would he want to see me? So I went to him. He said, kid, I see you
play saxophone, clarinet. How could he know that? We didn’t have computers in
those days, how did he know? Somehow it was on my record that I had been
playing with bands. He said, I— I’m going to give you a weekend pass. I want you
to come play in the — play wi — in the band here. And he give me a weekend pass.
Go back to South Orange, come back with your instruments. And I did. It was a
totally different life. No more KP. I didn’t have to even make my bed. Every —
everything was cared for me. I was now a musician among the elite, I guess. All I —

I didn’t have any chores, no potato peeling, nothing. And I practiced in the morning,
went to rehearsal. We rehearsed in the afternoon. We would broadcast on radio at
night.
Q: Live?
A: It was a great life. Huh?
Q: Live?
A: Live, yes, live broadcasts, and I — it was as great a life as anybody could
imagine. I me — war’s going on, here I am playing music here. I can play — I could
possibly play — play the rest of the war, just sitting there, and playing with
musicians. I was intimidated, in a way. I looked around me — cause I — I used to
follow these big bands, and I knew — I knew who the — who the — the side men
were. And these were not musicians, frankly, like today’s musicians. They were
trained in Juilliard, and places like that. They could orchestrate, arrange, compose.
So they were great musicians, the best of their day. And there I am sitting with
them, and trying to keep place with them. The very first number we play was a
number from Benny g — Benny Goodman orchestra created, called “Six Flats
Unfurnished.” That means the music is written in the — 1n six flats, and six flats, it
makes it tougher to play. And here I am, sitting with all these great musicians, and

playing a tough piece. And oh, tha-that was — that was — that was difficult. At any
rate, that went on. Could have — could have remained.
Q: How long did it go on?
A: I don’t think more than maybe a few weeks.
Q: Okay.
A: It could have been a great life. I think I could have spent probably the entire war
playing music. My name came up to be shipped out for basic training. Jack
Leonard intervenes, and gets the name stripped off. And I say, Jack
[indecipherable] he said. I said, I — I— Jack, I — I do want to g — want to go — yeah,
I’m — I’m in the army, I’m 20 years old. I just can’t imagine — I don’t say to him,
but I can’t imagine that I’m going to spend the war here. I know many of my peep —
my age, are going overseas, and they’re — some of them probably losing their lives
[indecipherable] and whatever. But my place is not here, it’s there. So I say, Jack,
I want to go out — I—I want to — I want to go on the list again. I said, I’ll go out, and
you know, eventually I’Il come back here. He said, kid, you leave here, you’re
never coming back again. And he was right, of course. I — I — I couldn’t dictate to
the army where I go. But so — so that was it, and I — I left the band. He took care of
shipping my instruments back to South Orange, and I was off, basic training.

A: Alabama, yes.
Q: Well, what time do we have right now? Then, why don’t we break at this point.
A: Oh, good. Okay. [break]
Q: Okay. So, before the break, we were talking about your first days and weeks in
the military, and how you were in this wonderful band, but that you did not feel
right staying at it, and asked that your name be put on the list to be called up for
basic training. Take us from there. Tell us where you went, and what this training
involved.
A: Well, so shortly after I made that determination, that I was — I was ready, I —I
wanted army life, I was put a — placed on an or — a shipping order, to be shipped
out. And we took a very circuitous route. I don’t know why in America, they felt
there may be threats, and we didn’t go directly down to Alabama, but sort of
weaved — weaved around. And I was told it was for security purposes. But we got to
Fort McClellan, deep into Alabama. And immediately I knew that I was going to
have a very, very hot summer. Temperatures at Fort McClellan in Alabama, rose
at times to over a hundred degrees.
Q: Oh my.
A: So, it was a very, very hot, difficult summer. But was a — it was a standard
training camp. What — what — one of the difficulties we had was that it was staffed

July 14, 2015
by what we called cadre, c-a-d-r-e, cadre. These are old-time army men who have
been through the wars. And here was a bunch of young, college, smart-aleck kids
coming down. They were not going to let us get away with an easy training period.
Training was three months. They gave us the most difficult forced marches. One of
the — one of the ultimate requirements was that we march, fully loaded with
equipment, backpacks, and all — all th — and all the — the equipment that we would
normally carry into battle. And we ru — march over Bain Gap. Bain Gap was a
very, very hilly mountain. And some had trouble making it. Certainly in the — in the
hot temperatures in which we were marching. We did it. I think just not everybody
made — made the march. That irritated them, and they said, you’re going back,
you’re going to do it again. And they made us march over Bain Gap, twice.
Q: The same day”?
A: No, no, no, no, we di — different dates.
Q: Okay.
A: But the — us-usually part of the training was for building your endurance, your
ability to survive in combat, where you have to do forced marches. But because we
all made it, they — you know, thi-this was emotional, more — more than tactical. So,
you got to march again, so we had to go over it again. The obstacle courses they set
up for us, were very, very difficult. Yeah, you’re climbing walls out of — you — you

run, cl — pull yourself on a rope, and go over. And jump over ponds, and you had to
jump far enough, otherwise you landed in the water. Rather tough exercises. So they
put us through a very strenuous program. I believe at that time I — oh, I— I was a
physical en-enthusiast. I took the Charles Atlas bodybuilding course, because I was
very small, and I had to build up — if I was small — I may be small in stature, but I
will not be small in body and strength. So I took the Charles Atlas bodybuilding
course, which was very popular at that time. So I had some things going for me
already. That, plus the training that we got at Fort McClellan, I — I think, to a large
extent, saved my life later — later on. One of the difficult things that also happened
at Fort McClellan, is that it was a— a —1t was a cu — a prisoner of war camp for
German soldiers. And I didn’t know, but they apparently, when they were captured
overseas, some of them were sent over here, to s — to POW camps. Fort McClellan
was a POW camp. Now, their treatment of prisoners — our treatment of prisoners, I
should say, as opposed to theirs, very, very different. They — as we were marching
on the-these — these tough — these obstacle courses, the marches, they would stand
in the fenced-in area, laughing at us, because we were being — we were the ones
who were being pushed, and they were living a — a wonderful life. They were
bronzed. You know, they had no shirts, and they were absorbing the sun. They
didn’t have to march in the sun, they just absorbed it. They had the rights to go to

the post exchange, where they could get cigarettes, candy, any — anything that was
available. They were living wonderful lives, and there they were, ridiculing us, and
laughing — laughing at us. And so in — as I write, later on, I say, hm, but look at how
things turned out. The guy they were laughing at, turns out to have survived, and
many of them, I’m sure, did not. That was compensation. So Fort McClellan,
again, was very difficult, but it did prepare us well for what lie ahead, and — lay
ahead. And then, after three months —
Q: How long did that last? Three months?
A: What?
Q: Three months?
A: We’ve had three months there, and really, it was a wa — it was a very good, a ver
—very good life. On Sunday mornings, we were pretty free, to do what — we could —
we could go to the mess hall, and order up — what we used to order — to get at home.
On Sunday morning, get breakfast. I used to be able to go up and tell the chef — I
don’t think we called them chef, we called them cooks, but I could tell him I wanted
eggs, bacon, toast on the side, yeah. Yeah. And we were getting that. And this was
army life? My gosh. It was a tough, tough camp, but sa — some of the relief on — on
— on Sundays, made it palatable. The heat was so great, that it was not uncommon
for people to pass out on the parade ground, when we were being marched, and all

that. And the only time in my life that I ever came about as close as you can get to
passing out, I — I sustained myself. Hundred degree temperatures, sun pouring
down, and we’re standing out in that sun, and we’re marching and marching. And I
—I felt weakness, and I — I just didn’t want to drop out. I remember getting to the
barracks, to the steps, and fine — just about making the few steps I had to my bed,
and then throwing myself on my bed. But had the great satisfaction that I didn’t
pass out on the parade ground. So again, very, very good, good basic training.
Tough but good, at Fort McClellan.
Q: And after three months, what happened?
A: Then we moved on. The army developed a — a program they called the Army
Specialized Training Program. It was to train soldiers, those who had some college
education — I believe that was the criteria that was used, you — you had to have
some education. You were being trained in one or two schools, either engineering —
they always needed engineers, or foreign languages. Foreign languages would have
been much more appropriate for me, because the last thing I — I — I was in — I was —
had any talent for, was engineering. That’s the way the army did things, though.
They always wanted to train you the army way, not some habit you might have
picked up in civilian life. And so, because I knew nothing about engineering, that’s
the school I went to. So, from Fort McClellan, I went to Alabama Polytechnic

Institute. Later became Auburn University. We had a campus life, we — we lived
in dorms on the campus. We still had marching drills, but we had classroom studies.
Q: Was this training to be an officer as well, or — or was that still part of being a
private?
A: That came later on, when we — I— when we tried to go to officer candidate
school.
Q: Okay.
A: [’ll come to that in a —
Q: Okay.
A: — ina few minutes. Because it all started where we — where we’re at now —
Q: Okay.
A: — at Auburn University. We — so we attended class. We didn’t — we di — did
military drills, and — and got some lectures on military stuff. But we attended class.
The — they had to reach far and wide to get in st — enough instructors for those
programs. And I remember the instructor I had in engineering, was an English tea —
professor in college. So, he was only a few pages ahead of us. And some of the guys
who I was with, were really engineering oriented people, and they were being held
back. For me it was o — okay, cause I knew nothing about engineering, but that’s the
way they did things. We — so, in addition to our studies, we had our weekends

reasonably free. There were four of us from the New York area, people — people
that I knew, and we formed a — a group — like, we — we were what was a — musical
promotors. We — on Saturday nights, we would have concerts. What were the
concerts? The big bands of the day were the — we had a-all on record, in my
dormitory room, and we would invite everybody in, we’d have drinks and — and —
and —
Q: Play music.
A: — was just — huh? Music, we had music. And I remember the kickoff — I think it
was the kickoff concert we had, was — we called it an awa — it — it was the bu — the
— the — the — the finest black musicians of their day. And there were many, many,
really some of the top, top musicians. And we had all them, you know, Count
Basie, Duke Eli-Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald. You know, all the great, great artists.
And — and that was all records, so people poured into the dormitory. So that was our
— our release, our relief from the pressures we were under.
Q: Here’s a question. You grew up in Newark in a mixed community. It wasn’t just
Jewish, it was also Gentile, it was also different ethnic groups, and so on. What
about army life? Were there — was — did you get exposed to people, and populations
and different kinds of young guys that you never would have met otherwise, and
were they — how was that for you, and describe that a little bit.

A: Yes, because the people — th-those who — those of us that they brought together
were from all parts of the country, and so obviously we met new acquaintances,
who became some of the — who became buddies, and friends. And enemies, too.
The reason I knew that the — when I say enemies — the reason I knew that we were —
that I had gotten some real good out of the training at Fort McClellan, was that
while we were there, we had one guy, he was about — he was over six feet tall, well
built, and all that. And he was too — I don’t remember what we called him, but too
G.I. He — he — he fa — every — everything — the script — you had to be right,
militarily do this right, march right, you know, everything like that. And it bothered
the other guys. I mean, we were normal — normal boys, you know, thrown into army
life, and he was very militaristic, and he got on their nerves. And one day, I— we
got into an argument, and I just was determined on ma — I’m many inches shorter
than he, I’m lots smaller, lighter in weight, but I’m going to take this guy on. And I
did, and I beat him. You know, wrestling, and stren — very strenuous wrestling, and
I brought him down. And — and — and the — and the guys cheered, you know, and —
and it helped build relationships. I remember his name, Bob — Bob Loring(ph).
And I remember that. But the — anyway, so our experience there was interesting, but
it was going nowhere. The battle losses in Europe were becoming very heavy.

Alabama when Normandy was — you know, after D-Day on Normandy?
A: June — that was June 6", 1944.
Q: Forty-four, yeah.
A: Four — no, I think — I think on the landing — oh yeah, it had to be — yes, it had to
be after the landing, because our troops had — had landed, and they were engaged in
battle, acro — acro — across France, and all that, and our losses. Even though we
moved rapidly — the British and American forces did move rapidly after — they were
bogged down in Saint-L6. And then after they broke out of there, and then they
moved right across. But the — 1n doing so, the losses were heavy, and with those
losses building up, the army looked at programs like ASTP, and said, we have to
abandon them, because we need ground troops overseas. So they did. And we were
Q: ASTP was your engineering school.
A: Engineering school, American special — Army Specialized Training Program.
The navy had a counterpart to that. The — so that program was to be abandoned, and
we were going to go into the infantry. That didn’t sound very glamorous, so a whole
bunch of us applied in two directions; one, to officer candidate school. Now, we —
we didn’t know at the time, if you — if you go to officer candidate school, you

graduate, you become a lieutenant, a let — lieutenant’s place was at the front, not in
the back. If you were a major, you could be in the back, but as a lieutenant, you
were more exposed than anybody else. But we just liked the idea. I did, anyway. I
wanted to become an officer. And I always had — had second thoughts about that,
because I was small. I wanted to be good. And I was so young. By this time, I was
21. And I said, many of the people I will be leading, though, many of these guys,
they’re going to be older than I, they’re going to be bigger than I, and I — can I
command their respect? It was — there were doubts that I had. But nevertheless,
rather than fight in the — in the ground — ground — in the ground troops, it would be
nice to be an officer. And the other thing that we went for, air ca — air cadet — the air
cadet academy in — it was in — in Georgia. We a — I just became fascinated, and
most of us did, with aircraft. Like, you wouldn’t have to be on the ground, and in
the mud, and all that, you’d be flying in the air. You know, like 1t was a—a-— an
easy job. It certainly wasn’t. The dangers that they were exposed to were as bad as
anything on the ground. But anyway, a whole group of us applied for both. I
remember going to the interview for a — for a— to become an officer. It was the
most austere setting I can ever, ever remember. I walk into this room, and all I see is
a long, long table, as far as I can see, of men sitting. Brass, all officers, high-ranking

officers. I’d never seen so much brass in my — in my life. And not a smile on
anyone’s face.
Q: Oh gosh.
A: And I had to be interviewed by them. I’m 20 — you know, 21 years old, I had
never been subjected to anything like that. It was grueling, but I think I did well,
and I think everybody thought they did well enough. On the — then we had to take
written exams. We never did find out how we did on the written exams. During that
same time, I don’t rem-remember who was there before or after, we applied to — to
go to air — the air academy and become fliers. So we did the same thing there, appli
— applied there. In each — oh, and — and we became so infatuated with aircraft, that
we s — instead of doing our studies at ASTP, at night we’d run through the halls,
flying like planes. You know, we’re young guys still, we’re — we’re airplanes now.
And we learned the silhouettes of every plane. We could identify every American
and every German plane. Which was important to know, whether it’s your enemy
coming at you, or one of your —
Q: One of yours.
A: — or one of your — one of your own. So, w-we — we were all air-minded by that
time. We were all ready to go off to the air. As it turned out, because of the huge
needs now overseas for ground troops, both programs were canceled, and we’re all

sent on our way. We went to — oh, oh, for — for — for more — now, combat training,
first was basic training, combat training, so I then — I was sent to — to Indiana,
Camp Atterbury in — near Indianapolis, in Indiana. And there were got combat
training. I learned to be able to, in the dark, strip down my — strip down and put
together my rifle. You had to be ab — you had to be able to do that, because who
know — under battle conditions, it may be nighttime, and yet your battle — your —
your rifle was your best friend in combat. If you were without that, you were in
trouble. So we learned to do that. But one of the things that the army did again, as
they did with ASTP, they assigned you to units in which you had no experience. I
was assigned to the motor pool. I knew not much more about an automobile engine
than the fact that — I knew there was a carburetor, I knew there were spark plugs,
and I knew somewhere, something created a spark, and that ignited the gasoline,
and that created the power. That’s all I knew, but I — about wha — what was under
the hood, I never had any experience with. So I’m assigned to the motor pool. So in
addition to ki — getting combat training, I got training in mechanics, and that. And
so that — that’s what I did for a very, very short time. Again, they had to abbreviate
it, because we’re now needed overseas. So I shipped out of there.

how everybody, everybody, every business, every everything — everything was
devoted to the war. General Motors stopped making automobiles, they made tanks,
instead. The luxury bo-bo-boats were converted into troop carriers, and so I was on
this luxury troop carrier. We sailed overseas, and landed in — landing in Liverpool.
When we got to liver — to Liverpool, that was just a weigh station, waiting to take
us across the English channel. We made it to Liverpool, and I remember standing

up on the deck and looking down, and there were people holding newspapers, s —
Mauritania, the SS Mauritania, which what we sailed on, SS Mauritania sunk.
Well, there — there were Nazi submarines all across the Atlantic, and the navigators
on those ships had to weave their way across to try to avoi-void them. Many of our
tr — many of our supply carrier ships were — were — were bombed, wa-was — were —
were destroyed in the Atlantic Ocean, never getting overseas. And some troop
carriers were hit. But anyway, we get there, and th-the paper said, Mauritania
sunk. And we’re looking down, we’re here. So we trained a little bit more.

going to battle for — with. And sailing across the English channel was not a simple
thing. You started off in a Liberty ship, which 1s a very small, small version of
these large, bi-big ocean liners. Started off in one of those. But to get to shore, you
had to go — you had to descend from that ship, to an LST, yeah, a landing ship tank.
There was different versions of that, they were called different names, but I think
the one we were on was an LST. And you probably have seen pictures of landing
troops during D-Day —
Q: Right.
A: — those — those little boats that came into shore, as close as they could get, then
these big doors come down.
Q: Correct.
A: And then the soldiers are off, into the water. St — the big — the most difficult part
of that trip was fir-fir-first of all recognizing, you know, now — now, this 1s for real,
because you — you — your — you’re di — you’re going to face the enemy pretty soon.
Now you have gas masks, rifles on — on your — on your shoulders, and on your
back. And so this is — this is combat. The treacherous part of that trip was the
exchange you made from the liberty ship, down to the LST, because you had to
climb down on a net. And we were warned in advance, one false step, and it may
mean your life. So you had to place each foot perfectly. We had about 30 pounds of

equipment on our backs; rifles, gas masks, everything we would carry into battle.
So, you had to si — watch your step. I was very, very careful. Some did not make it.
I heard stories about many on D-Day who slipped and fell between the ships. Now,
the little ship 1s bobbing, and there — the two ships are crashing together. Some were
crushed before they ever even got to shore. So I climbed down cautiously, and got
into the ship. Now, for some strange reason, this — I mentioned earlier, this group
with me at — that ran the concerts, the — one of them was with me yet. He turned out
later in life to be in adver — an advertising executive for one of the big advertising
firms in New York. But he wa — he was that kind of a person. For some reason he
bought a camera, he brought a camera. We’re going into combat, and Herb has a
camera. And he says, Bob, tell you what to do. As soon as that door goes down, I’m
going to be right up front, I’m going to get off first, and then I want you to come
out, and I’m going to take a picture of you landing on Omaha Beach. And he did.
He got a — and the — and the door goes down, you know. And this — this is crazy,
really crazy thi-thinking, to begin with. You’re going into combat, maybe just hours
away from the enemy, and you’re taking a photograph. Anyway, Herb did take that
photograph. I never did see it. Along the way, we separated, he went to another unit,
and — and I saw him in New York after the war, and Herb — he was with a big

A: We still —
Q: You know, this is a — this is something that a — kids will do, because —
A: You're so right.
Q: Yeah, they’re so adventurous.
A: We were not — we were not yet mature soldiers. It would take a little seasoning,
under ca — under combat conditions, for us to wise up to what it was all about. And
that, as a matter of fact, was characteristic of my early days in combat. I still did not
recognize that this is a very serious business. But anyway, I was assigned to the six

fire was not too far away. I was assigned to the Sixth Armored Infantry Division.
We rode half-tracks.
Q: What’s that?
A: Half-tracks are — are vehicles that have — they have an area — there’s the — the
driver’s ca — ca — ca —cabin. Next to the driver sits the officer in charge, and the
driver — and then there’s an ope — big open area, wall — sides on — on the thing, but
it’s open on the top, and there are benches on each side. Anywhere from four to

Q: A tank.
A: —a tanks. They had those kind of tracks, and wheels in the front. But the tracks
to give tr-traction, and the wheels to be able to guide and make quicker turns than a
tank could make. And that was our — that was our home. That’s wha — where we
fought from.
Q: Oh, wow.
A: Until they became obsolescent. And I’Il explain that in a — in a— 1n a moment.
But anyway, there we were, and we were assi — and I — I was assigned to that — to A
company in tha — 1n a platoon, and — and to that half-track. First days in combat, it
was, you know, it was still — still not real yet.
Q: This was still in France, though?
A: We’re — we’re in France now. Now we’re driving across France to engage the
enemy. We — the first day in camp, we are shelled by enemy forces. And those
shells come over. It’s a frightening feeling, but I still — still, 1t didn’t register on me
yet, because they — they passed over — the ones you hear are okay, the — you know,
they pass — they passed you. The ones that hit you are the ones you don’t hear. You
don’t hear the ones that hit you, because that — that sound passing overhead doesn’t

get there. They — they come right at you. Anyway, those shells were passing
overhead. We had a ca — a few in our half-track who had fought 1n the north African
campaign, they were used to this. And they knew when shells come in, that’s
dangerous. And they jumped — dropped to the floor, and I — I looked, and I
wondered why. Well, th-they — they knew what — the seriousness of it. I still didn’t
know. We — there were some German soldiers came out of the woods, they were g1-
gi-giving up, with their hands up, threw their rifles away. And we had a machine-
gunner on our vehicle who was firing at them. And I yelled, we all yelled, stop,
stop, they’re surrendering. And so other troops, other American troops came by,
took them away, and we continued the — the — we were a-a-approaching enemy
terri-territory, and shells started to come in. The last place you want to be in a half-
track is on a road that’s zeroed in by en-enemy heavy artillery. And so we pulled it
off the road. Now, we’re off the road, but we’re still being shelled. We sought
cover. I jumped out of the half-track, because we were targets in there, no — no — no
roof. And I — I jumped be — on the be — and I lay down on the back end of that.
Some of the other fellows were in the front. I waved to them, there in the front,
looking back toward us, under — under the front axle of the vehicle. And they’re
looking — and I’m waving, they’re not waving back. And again, I still hadn’t gotten
the reality of warfare. This is very, very serious business. And then I see them

taking stretchers, some of our men had been hit. It begins to have an effect, I said,
you know, this is a — a serious business. The next morning, I found out how serious
it was. We — we pulled into a field, there were tanks, and there are half-tracks, and
we were told to dig in. Mean, you — you build a bu — you dig a bunker. I was still
not oriented yet to military life. I was a defiant, young, 21 year old, and ah, bunker.
You know, we’ll be moving on, and all the — all the effort of going through a
bunker. I didn’t dig a bunker. Shellfire is in the morning, early. We call it incoming
mail. The enemy always strikes at dawn. Incoming mail, those are the bombs are —
these — these shells are — are landing. All of a sudden, my rifle is blown out of my
hand, my hand stings. I look at my rifle lying on the ground, there’s a hole in the —
in the ba — in the barrel of the rifle. So, a shell — a shell pierced the rifle, could have
pierced me, but didn’t.
Q: Close.
A: Yeah, but a quick, quick lesson. Suddenly it hits me, this is very serious
business. Every moment you’re out here on this — on this field or any other battle
field, your life is in danger. So, quick, quick realization. From somewhere,
somebody came up and handed — and ga-gave me a rifle. So now I was in combat. I
never, never disobeyed that command again, to di-dig when — when we’re — when

we’re stopped for a while, you dig yourself a foxhole, and it could save your life,
which it did — did. So that was my introduction to combat.
Q: Was that the first time you saw casualties, where you saw people being killed?
A: It — 1t was, and it was a strange, strange feeling. After a while, we abandoned the
half-tracks, so we were on foot. And I remember proceeding on foot. We were
facing an enemy, we were firing, they were firing. The man in front of me, the man
behind me were both hit. And wa — my — first time I had seen anybody killed in
even civilian life. And I stopped and I paused. Troops were moving on, and I just
paused, and I looked at these two men, and I started to think, all the wonderful
things in life they will never see, never feel again. I — those thoughts just ran
through my mind, not very formally, but tho — those kind of thoughts. And then I
found myself thinking about their families, they’Il never be the same again, cause
the father, the brother, an uncle, aunt — an uncle, they were gone. And so, now I was
really introduced to warfare, and I took it very seriously from that — that point on.
Q: Sounds like it was a wake-up call.
A: It was — it was my wake-up call.

A: No.

either of them.

A: Why did what?
Q: Why did you abandon — why did —
A: The half-track?
Q: Yeah, why would they abandon them?
A: Because they were sitting targets. They’re a v — a large enough vehicle, that you
don’t have to be that accurate with shellfire. And whereas with troops — first of all,
troops have — have a way of separating, or getting into foxholes, and all that.

Q: And a tank — and a tank has enough protection?
A: A tank has much, much more protection. We had no protection. We had no — no
top. Tanks are — are — the armor 1s much, much thicker than we had, and they had
protection on all sides. So, we didn’t have any of that protection. And that was just
— those things that we rode in, those half-tracks, they were just vehicles to move us
faster. Otherwise, troops had to be moved by trucks, to get them up to s-speed, and
part of — part of it was marching. But a good part of the time to get — get them up on

to cross the Hans-sur-Nieds river. The Germans — we had driven the Germans over

they were sitting up on a hill above, and zeroed in right on the spot. A — very, very
easy to zero in on any troops, or any vehicles certainly, coming across. So we
crossed — and I remember scuttlebutt among the troops was that we’re going into a
very dangerous battle. How we knew, or how they knew, I do — I don’t know, but a
very dangerous battle. We have to cross a river up there, and we think the odds of
getting across are not very great. So here’s my introduction really, to combat

A: There was a — a — it was a — a structured bridge, structured by probably the
German troops, I don’t — yeah, they had to be by the German troops, but as

bridge, facing enemy fire as we — as we did. And they retreated, we dro — drove

general — a famous general, Third Army. Patton. One — a great, great — a great —a
victory for General George Patton, and the Sixth Armored Infantry Division,
which was our operation. We were operating within the thir — his Third Army. But
it was a—a-—a victory. And then, obviously, we moved on from there.
Q: What was the weather like at that point?
A: I don’t remember it very well. I don’t think it was yet what we — it was probab —
we were probably in November weather, October, November, as we fought. So it
wasn’t real cold yet. That was about to come, as we moved into December, and
headed toward my next major battle. And that turned out to be the Battle of the
Bulge.
Q: Okay, before we get there, as you’re crossing the river, and the German army is
retreating, were you involved in combat, or was it there was — there were m —
soldiers and infantry in front of you who were engaging with them, and you were
following behind?
A: No, I don’t remember where I was positioned, but we were firing.
Q: Okay.

subjected to heavy fire.

north and south along — alo — a long, long, long corridor, so to speak. And that was
their major thrust.
Q: But you didn’t know it at the time, did you?
A: Didna — didn’t — had no idea what it was, and what it was going to be called. All
we knew, that we were facing heavy, heavy artillery.

where do you think you were?
A: I—I was in — in Belgium, very southern tip of Belgium, near Bastogne, in —
near — right outside of Marvie, m-a-r-v-i-e, Marvie, Belgium, southeastern corner,
just above Germany, just north of Germany. And so, heavy, heavy shellfire poured
in on us. We were bogged down. The unit that I had — the — the company —

A: Lots of forests. It was — it was called — th-the battle itself, I had fought through
two other major battles across France, this was my third battle. It was called the
Ardennes campaign, because it was being fought in the Ardennes forest, heavily
treed. And that was southeastern Belgium, and northwe — northeastern Germany.

Germany. Cause the east would be near Poland.

A: Oh yeah, yeah, oh of — oh, of — oh, of course. Of course northwestern Germany,
of course.
Q: Yeah.
A: The surprise — and what — the — I— I— I —I—I was — I learned to believe, let’s
say, from what I read later on, that the Americans expected a major thrust, because
the Germans could be driven just back — back just so far. And they had tremendous,
heavy artillery. Their tank corps were probably superior to the American. And so I
th — I believe that our top command expected that, but nevertheless, the — the
magnitude of the attack was just overpowering. The company that I had trained
with, the 106" infantry division, in the U.S., on that first day of battle, lost 75
percent of its troops, killed, wounded or captured, or missing. Seventy-five percent
in one day. The word was that that division that I trained with — and I left early, to
be shipped over as a replacement, they were not ready yet for combat. They were
green. And you read the accounts of — of — of that unit, the 106" infantry division,
and you realize how poorly prepared they were. They were scattered, they ran in all
directions. Some of them shot their own men. They were just firing at anything they
saw. They were such in — in that kind of disarray. And I hate to think about that
with an American unit, particularly one that I trained with. But nevertheless, the
Germans were well-equipped, well trained, well prepared, and they — they — and

then they — they drove 1n-into us. The report that I read later on, when I was
reported missing in action, was that the unit I was with had been subjected to heavy
enemy fire. And in the process, troops were scattered, and got lost. And thus, I was
reported missing in action, because I was — I was not present, not account —
accounted — I couldn’t be accounted for.
Q: So, what happened to you?
A: Ah, that’s — see, they didn’t — they didn’t have that — they didn’t have that. All
they knew was that I was — I was missing. When you tally up your troops afterward,
you say, this guy’s missing. They had no idea what happened to me. We had been
fighting, the German attacked, and I was with the unit, I was on the line, I was
fighting. We were face to face with the enemy, we were fi-fighting. And then I and
others were — were ordered back behind the lines, because this had been going on
for days, and I was weary. So yeah, they figured the troops need some rest, go back
behind the lines, get some rest, get some food, and then you’ll resume later on. So
when I got behind — behind the lines, I was now with all allied forces, the ger —
Germans were far removed, I heard somebody say, we need volunteers. We’ve lost
radio contact. The Germans have apparently knocked out our radio contact with
front line troops. So we have to establish where our — our lines are. We need vala —
volunteers to do that. I was still 21, I think, so I was young, and adventurous. I’d

just begun to learn what war was about. But I also felt that 1t was a mission.
Something moved me, and — and I said, yeah. So Pll vol — Pll volunteer. I saw a
Jeep in the di — in the distance, and I said, I'll get that Jeep. And I signaled to five
others, and they joined me. We said, we — we — we'll be a volunteer task force,
we'll go as far as we can go, and see if we can identify where our lines are. High
command cannot pri — plan strategy, unless they know where the lines are. So,
that’s what we started out to do. So, we’re in this Jeep, it’s now — the vision is not
very clear, it’s an overcast sky. I remember driving the Jeep, the roads are covered
with 1— snow and ice. We round a curve, and just about — maybe about 10 to 15
yards ahead of me, there’s a German 88 millimeter cannon pointed right at the Jeep,
right at us. And it’s mounted on an 80 — on a— a— a German ta-tank. And so, you
know, anybody pulled that trigger, we were gone. And I can talk, and I do talk man
—many, many times, the number of times that you are exposed to killing, to being
killed, and that was — that was one of them, and there were many, many others. So
it’s, you know, miracles take place, and you don’t get killed. But that was one that
they certainly — somebody should have pulled the trigger, and we would have been
gone. They didn’t. I jammed on the brakes, we skidded off the road. All of a
sudden, fire from rifles — apparently mi — rifles and machine-guns, small arm fire, is
pouring in from our right. And we — none of us were hit immediately. I — I say, we

have to — we have to defend ourselves yet. Have to find something, we can’t do it
from the Jeep here. We see a shack across the road, and I say, we move toward that
shack. We did. One of the men had the perception to real-realize, we go near the
machine-gun — some — somebody’s firing a lot of — lot of ri-rifle fire at us, or
machine-gun fire. So he too — he detached the one from the Jeep, and brought that
with us. So we start racing for the shack. One of our men is hit and killed on the
way over. We get to the shack, and the enemy fire is still pouring in. We have to set
up the machine-gun, some way, to fire back. And so there’s a big bay window in the
shack. The man who took the machine-gun, I think it was him, he sets it up in the
window, and he starts firing. Within maybe a minute or so, he’s hit, and he’s — he’s
killed. When I talk to student groups, I — I say sometimes people — un-understand,
you do things under battlefield conditions, you do things you would not normally
do, because you do it on your instinct. Something tells you that you have to take —
you have to do something right now. So, my instinct, without thinking about the
consequences, I was wide open, I would be killed just like the other man was, your
instinct 1s a — 1s a— jump behind that gun. Which is what I did, and I started firing.
And I fired the machine gun at everything I saw move. I hit some, probably killed a
number of their men. And that went on — that had started early in the morning — that
went on until late in the afternoon, we’re running out of fire. We didn’t — we had no

idea what we were against, at the time. I learned later on that there were at least a
hundred — somewhere between a hundred and 200 si — over there, dug in, in
foxholes. And we were — we started out with six of us, one was killed immediately,
so there were five of us, fighting them, and for a good part of the day. That
machine-gun really kept us going. When we ran low on ammunition, we had to
devise some strategy, how do we get out of this? We had two wounded. There was
another window, so two a — two of them were hit. I — I looked, and I saw a trap door
in the floor of this shack, meaning there must be a cellar beneath. So the strategy
was simply this; we had to make them believe that they killed us off, or that we —
we — we took off toward our — our rank, toward our — our la — our American and our
British lines. And so, I figure, we'll climb down into this cellar, and then when it’s
dark, under cover of darkness, we’ll emerge. If we can take those two wounded, we
will certainly do that, we certainly wanted to do that. And we — so that was the —
that was the idea. We would infiltrate through their lines at night, under cover of
darkness, we possibly could do that.
Q: So there were two of you who were not wounded yet?
A: Ah, well there were — we started out with six, five me — six, one was hit. So there
were five of us. So there — there were two wounded, and three able-bodied. So we —
that wa — that was the strategy, then we would come out and make our way back

through the lines. Because we had no ammunition, we absolutely ran out of a-
ammunition. Of about — I — I don’t know, it was about a half hour or so — no way to
measure time, but I figured somewhere around there, I push open that trap door,
maybe we could come out now, maybe it’s dark now, and what I saw — and I always
tell people when I — when I talk to them, there’s some things in battle, 11 combat, or
captivity, that you don’t remember, that you block out, and some of them are
blocked out of your mind. Either you don’t ca — you don’t remember them, or you
don’t want to remember them. Some that you have a vague re — recollection of, and
others that remain visible to you, perhaps for the rest of your life, as this one does
today. So as I stand before you now, I can tell you, I see that rim of black, automatic
guns, all pointed down, right at my face. And behind each of those guns is a white-
cloaked, camouflaged German soldier, holding that gun, trigger finger poised, ready
to fire at any moment. [doorbell]
Q: Let’s cut. [break] All right, so — so be-before the interruption, we’re at a

70 years later, I can still see them there, stark as can be, in addition to all those —
those guns, pointed right at me, the stark nature of the black against the white. And
they motioned, come up. And so we come up, and we take the wounded up with us.
What — for whatever reason, they — this German sergeant takes me aside, the others
take the other Americans, and they’re off. I never see them again, and the German
sergeant is in charge of me now. And he’s got a rifle barrel in my back, pushing me
around. Usher him around the shack, to make sure there are no booby traps there,
and then he pushes me, rifle in the back, across the road. This road, as I write about
it, I call the moat. It was like a moat, it was — separated us, one from the other, and
W-w-we were in our castle, that little shack, and the moat protecting us from the
enemy. But we crossed the road, and just then — we get onto the other side, and just
then, art — heavy artillery comes in. I never knew, and don’t know to — to — today,
whether it was British or American, but it’s coming in. We had called for it early in
the day, and now it just starts coming in. It’s dusk, it’s — nightfall is coming on, and
these shells are landing. The German sergeant jumps into his bunker, his foxhole,
and I motioned to come down. Nein, nein, he said, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein,

the worst things you can have, because you get shell blasts when those things hit,

piece in the wrong place, and your —
Q: You’re gone.
A: — you’re dead.
Q: Yeah.
A: And that’s the nature of things. I — I — I keep thinking of it so often — people
remind me sometimes 1n talking, you had so many opportunities to die. That was
another one. I mean, the fact that you weren’t hit, with all these shells coming in,
was amazing. Anyway, so the German is in his bunker, and the shellfire 1s coming
in. I say to him, what are you going to do with me? I figure he doesn’t — he speaks
German. And he looks up at me, and he says, I have to kill you. In English. So here
it is, the good fortune, you get a German who s — soldier who speaks English. So
now, you can converse. I have to kill you. The assumption is that he will. He’s
going to turn his rifle on me, and he will shoot.
Q: And that’s what he would have done, had he not been interrupted.
A: Chances are yes, because the order had been issued, high command. This is late
in the war now, and they’re not to take any more allied prisoners alive. They just
can’t cope with them. They have to deal with the enemy. So they just shoot them.

assumption was, he was going to pull his gun, and fire.
Q: I want to interrupt at one point, before we go on. Do you have any kind of
thinking on why you were separated out? The four were taken by other guys, and
why you were separated out?

moved them away, and I was left with him. I think just chance.

because again, the order had been issued. They weren’t — they just weren’t taking
any prisoners alive any more. They couldn’t — couldn’t afford to do that. So, that
was it, and when he said, I — I have to kill you, I assumed he would turn his rifle on
me, and I looked down the road. Now, it’s — it’s night, it’s dark. There’s a burning
tank in a field nearby. And the ro — and that road we crossed over is lit up. Also at

two silhouettes on each bunker, one is a German helmet, and the other is a machine-
gun. So I know, that as far as I could see, the — there were bunkers. I had been a

experience, if ever there was a time to use it, this is it. And I was gonna sprint dow
— try to get out into the road and sprint down that road. Then I suddenly realized,
you'd be shot out of the starting block. They had all these guns trained on you. I
mean, there was no way you could es — you could escape. Behind me, if I tried to
run there, there were guards there. There were other foxholes, so I — it was just no
place to go. And so I—I se — I realized I had — the only option I had was
conversation. But I’m talking to a German. And so, what he — and then I
remembered, just a moment ago he said, I have to shoot you, this man speaks
English. Maybe we can converse, and you know. So he says — he looks up at me —
we pau — we paused for a while. I’ve given up the idea of running. He looks up and
he says, why are you Americans here? This is not your war. I said, how — I said, you
made it our war, how can you say that? Conversation goes on. The reason that I
think this sequence would be so good on film, as opposed to just in print, you know,
you have to see a relationship developing between this German soldier, and this
American soldier. I’m his captive, he’s supposed to shoot me, and he doesn’t.
Q: What did he look like? Do you remember what he looked like?
A: The one thing I don’t remember, because I kept seeing that helmet on the — he
didn’t look up all the time, like that. Sometimes he was looking straight ahead, and

we were talking. And I—I comment on that in my book, that while lying in the
hospital and thinking of some of these events that occurred, I try to remember his
face, and I can’t, because again, I saw so little of it. Maybe his chin under that
helmet, but not the whole face. And the conversation goes on. He reaches down into
his pocket, and I figure he’s got a pistol there. He’s a noncommissioned officer,
he’s probably allowed to carry a pistol, he’s going to shoot me with a pistol instead
of the rifle. Instead, he pulls out a wallet. He opens the wallet, and then he turns it
towards me, he shows me pictures of his wife and two children. And he says, next
year, we will be in New York City. That was his plan. He foresaw it. He was a
good Nazi, he believed that they were going to win the war, and he would — they’d
go on vacation, and they’d take, of all places in the world, New York City. To
them, it’s like Paris is to us. And so, the conversation wears on, and we’re talking.
And I—I ke —I—I feel a change in attitude. This guy is not the — he’s not the
enemy an-any more. And I don’t think he sees me as the enemy either. And we’re
talking. His English is more than good enough. I mean, I understand everything he
is saying. And so, we converse. After a while — and as I say, attitude 1s changing,
we're — we’re not antagonists. The way we were —
Q: Are the shells still falling?

Q: So, he’s in the foxhole, and you’re on the ground above it.
A: I’m standing above him, looking down.
Q: So you’re standing?
A: I’m standing. Oh yeah, I’ve — I was completely vulnerable while the shells were
— were landing. Oh, I — I was standing all the time. I didn’t get an invitation to sit at
the edge of the foxhole and dangle my feet into it, nut — nut — you know, there was
no — no invitation. I just — I stood all the time. But again, there’s something
changing in our relationship. And finally, he looks — he looks up at me, he says, for
you, the war is over. And I assume he’s going to turn his rifle on me, kill me. His
next statement is, I’m going to send you to a prisoner of war camp. He knew, and he
knew that I knew, in the POW camp, you don’t have to fight any more, you get
shelter, food, good treatment. They did — I’m quite certain — I— I—-I-—I-—I-—I know
this, that they — they did follow the Geneva con — the rules of the Geneva
convention, and if I did go back to a prisoner of war camp, that I would not have to
fight any more. And that was his way of ex — of recognizing gallantry. And he said
— he went on to say — he says, we had many more men than you, but you fought
well. And as I said, how — I didn’t think right at the moment, but later on when I —
when I thought back about that, what gallantry. You know, here’s a German soldier,
my archenemy, and he’s going to save my life, because he understood and

appreciated the way we fought against these extreme odds. And he said, you killed
many of our men, but you fought well. And so he — he, in earnest, was about to save
my life. He orders over two guards to take me away. As they do, there’s — we’re
stopped along the way, and I can look — I can see by the things on the man’s
shoulder, or wherever they were, that he’s an officer. And there’s a German
conversation that goes on. I don’t know what the conversation 1s, but I soon
recognize what it was. No, I’m not going to a prisoner of war camp, they don’t take
prisoners any more, I’m going to become a slave laborer. Because one of the things
that they needed — and there were ma-many, a-as you well know, non-military men
who are forced into slave labor. And slave labor in many of the camps, existed.
Anyway, that’s what I’m going to be.
Q: And how do you understand this?
A: What followed. I didn’t understand what they were saying, but when I realized
afterward, that no longer did I have those guards, somebody else took me, and
pushed me — al-always I — did I — rifle barrel was in the back, kept pushing me with
the rifle barrel, until suddenly, I’m confronted with a bunch of soldiers; I don’t
recognize the uniforms. As one of my friends, who’s a historian told me, he a — he a
— told me those were quite likely Russian troops, that had — then he describes how
Russian troops would be in that area. And chances are they were, because they were

completely foreign uniforms. They were not German, they were not British, they
were not American. And so I see all these uniforms, and others from different —
obviously some other countries involved in there. And I’m pushed by rifle butt, and
I — I fall to the ground. I see all these people around. I don’t know what it’s all
about, I have no idea yet. So we — we sit there, we’re sitting on snow, and finally, a
rifle butt to the back again, up, and then the rife — he sort of motions up, up, and
we’re into a forced march. Before they did that, though, they stripped me of my
winter coat, and the gloves. This is Germany’s coldest winter on record. The
temperature during that period, I was told later, was between zero and five degrees
Fahrenheit. The coldest on record. So now I’m going to go without any gloves, no
winter garments, just a thin jacket. That’s it as I go ahead, forced marched with
these others.
Q: Did they ever find identity papers on you? Did you have identity papers, did you
have —
A: All I had on me was my dog-tags that had a J. Some had a J, some had an H. I
had a J. I had two other things on me. One was a Mogen David, a Star of David, a
Jewish symbol, and the other was a miniature mezuzah, what we Jews put on our
doorposts. I wore them with my dog-tags. I was 21, and I was defiant. There was no
way in the world that I was going to remove those. I was told, though I didn’t see it,

but I was told that some destroyed their dog-tags, because they didn’t want to be
identified as Jews. But, I— I—I1-I stuck steadfast to that, and I wore them. I didn’t
—]—J-—J-—TI didn’t know what I — what I was getting into at this point, and nobody
was talking in English, so I had no idea where — where we were going, what we
were going to do.
Q: Did they know you were Jewish?
A: Not at that time, beca — remember this, they have — each — each of these soldiers
has a responsibility. Theirs was not ideology, theirs was not to eradicate all the Jews
in the world. Theirs was to get work done. That work was rebuilding their railroads,
bombed by allied planes. That was the only mission they had. So — but I didn’t — I
did not know that. I did not know what we were going to be doing, what I wa — I
didn’t know what I was. I just knew that I was — I was thrust into something with a
bunch of other men. I was nameless, numberless. I was just a body, working hands,
and that’s what I would be. And only later did I learn that I was there for slave
labor, and whether I lived or died, made no difference to them whatsoever.
Q: How did you learn that you were there for slave labor? What told you that?
A: Well, later on, when I saw what we were doing.
Q: Okay.
A: Now, it’s ti— I don’t know this yet.

Q: Okay.
A: And we’re being force marched. Darkness descends. When they took off my
gloves and coat, I assumed that they were going to — I was a prisoner, I was their
prisoner, I was going to go to a barracks someplace, and I’d have shelter. That
wasn’t on — on their minds, at all. So when darkness fell, they motioned, down,
down, and pushed some of us down on the ground. On the ground. We’re on a road.
Off to the side they push us, and say — I don’t remember what they said, but it was
obvious we were going to lie there, and that’s where we were going to sleep. The
roads were covered, most of the time, with snow, or ice. Sometimes they’re just
dark, dirty — you know, dirt, you know, but most of the time was snow or ice. And
they had guards patrolling. That’s where you spent the night. For the next 80 some
odd, out of 90 nights, that’s where I slept, without a coat, with no gloves, hands —
hands tucked in here, to try to keep warm. Toes moving constantly. Toes and
fingers cons — constant movement. Otherwise, they would have frozen. Which they
did later anyway, I had frostbite. But this 1s one of the remarkable things that
happened during that period. Desperate, you’re freezing, almost freezing to death,
really, because much more of that, and I would have. The only thing that could
sustain me, was mental or emotional. And what I thought of was food. And one
thing you never really want to think about when you’re starving — I think everybody

would s — would s — would re — remember that, you don’t think about food. But that
helped to sustain me. It’s not only physical pain, but emotional pain that I was
going through. And so, if I could draw some kind of an emotion, that would give
me some hope for the future, maybe that would help to see me through whatever
this is that I’m — I’m getting 1n-into.
Q: What did they feed you?
A: What did they feed — feed me?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Crusts of dark brown bread. That was the standard. And that — most days — I’m
not sure if we got that every day, but that was — that was the food. There were two
camps we passed through. Labor camps, not prisoner of war camps, but labor
camps. E-Even that would have been better than what we had. Cause I had the
maximum of exposure you could. But in the — in these camps, we — which we just
passed through, only spent the day going through them, I remember in jeros — in
Prum, p-r-u-m, Germany, a labor camp, we were given six, one inch in diameter
crackers, sort of dry cracker, and that was it for the day. We went on marching. We
got to Gerolstein in Germany, and there they gave us a can — and I don’t mean a
canteen, the way the military has, but a ti — old — like an old, tin Campbell’s soup
can. And old tin can, and in it was some hot water. There was a little piece of potato

at the bottom, that was the flavoring. So that was called soup. And we drank that
hot water, that was it for the day. I don’t have to make any more clear than that how
our — how our nutritional needs were not being met, and malnutrition set in rapidly,
and you could feel it happening. But that essentially is — 1s the — 1s the amount of
food that we had.
Q: How does one feel malnutrition? [technical interruption] How does one feel
malnutrition set in? What happens?
A: You know —
Q: What happened to you?
A: Consciously, you know, of course, that you’re not being fed adequately. And just
from logical standpoint, you begin to say that, you know, you — you — this can’t go
on too long. So intellectually, you realize that something is going to be happening to
your body. Then you start to feel weakness. The marches are more difficult, they’re
getting more and more difficult. You feel pain in your stomach, cause there’s
nothing to fill it, and that radiates through your body. So y-y-you — you know that
there’re physical aspects taking shape now, and you know — I mean, I — I knew that
bodies do deteriorate if you don’t get — you know, I was brought up as a child, eat
your cereals, eat your vegetables, and so forth. You have to, to build your bodies.
So I knew I wasn’t getting any of that, so my body had to deteriorate. After a while

— that — that takes a lot of days, and maybe weeks before you really see it. And I
could feel my shoulders, they were very boney, and my arms were starting to lose
some of the flesh that they had. And so I began to realize that, yeah, there was some
kind of deterioration going on here. But weakness probably was the greatest
recognition that I had, that something was happening to the body. Then, as we were
being force marched, sometimes from location to location, when we worked on
railroads, people were dropping out along the way. And I realized that they were
dropping out from weakness, from the malnutrition. Must be — must be a—a
chemical [indecipherable] condition, whatever it was. But they were —
Q: They were starving.
A: — they were dropping along the way. Dropping out was not a good thing, because
you were no longer useful as a slave laborer, and so either — in some cases — why
they made the decision, I don’t know, but in some cases, they left the man there to
die. In other cases, they shot the man. Yeah.
Q: Did you see these things?
A: Pardon?
Q: Did you see those things?
A: I saw them. One of the — be-before I leave the subject altogether, I just want to
go back to that period of sleeping at night, and the food. And I thought about food.

It sustained me emotionally, to be able to go on. Why? Because I figure someday
I’m going to get out of this, I d— I don’t know how, but someday I will — I will —
this will be over, and tho — and the wonderful foods — when you’re starving, you
think about food. And I said, I ca — those wonderful foods, the things that my
mother used to make, things we got in the pizza parlor. You know, all — all the
wonderful thing, someday I’m going to have that again. And that emotionally
helped to carry — carry me. So rather than — rather than drop out and die on th — on —
on li — lying there, I was able to sustain myself with the belief that someday I would
have access to those foods. Months later, when I was hospitalized, I asked a nurse to
bring me a little book — booklet of some sort that I could write on, I recorded that. I
have that here.
Q: Oh wow.
A: It’s —I call it my little brown book. I recorded 84 foods. They’re in that book, if
you want to see later, it’s r— it’s right in an envelope over there.
Q: We’ll — we’ll take a look and we’|l film it. That’ll be great.
A: Yeah.

A: I have that book, along with the dog-tags with the Jewish emblems on them. I ha
— have those here. So, might be nice to do that. But those — so I remembered the 84
foods, and that did, emotionally, it helped to sustain me.
Q: I also — I’m sorry that I’m interrupting, but I also have another question. You had
said that your basic training in Alabama, in a hundred degree-plus heat —
A: Right.
Q: — prepared you. Yet, when you were under the strain and you were in — captured,
you were at minus something Fahrenheit temperature. What about the basic
training, then, was transferable from one climate to the other?
A: It wasn’t the climate, but it was the bo — the strengthening of body.
Q: Okay.
A: They built our bodies, as I told — the exercise drills, were ve — were reasonably
extreme. And so, I was probably in the best condition of my life, physi-physically.
So that’s all. But wha-wha — what’s — what’s odd about that is that I went from the
extremes in temperature in basic training, from a hundred —
Q: Right.

A: And that was — that was a gr — a great, great vari-variation. So these forced
marches went on. We stopped along the way, to work on the railroads, but to work
on the railroads, we had to move railroad tracks, long, heavy railroad tracks, one
area to another. If their sup — to keep their supply line going to their troops, they
had to maintain the railroads. And so, we had to get tracks, sometimes from one
abandoned railroad, to another that was in service, and needed. Mostly at night, we
were forced marched again, we had to carry those railroad tracks on our shoulders.
Now, this is when I knew they — they became boney, because ri — they hurt. We
would carry them sometime, from one town to another, many miles. And I would
have one on my shoulder, and somebody in front would have ano — have the other
end of it on his shoulder. So we had to carry those railroad tracks, town to town.
Q: Did you ever speak with any of the other prisoners?
A: Speech was not allowed, conversation was not allowed. If you — if they caught
you talking, they turned their gun on you. I don’t remember seeing anybody shot,
because we maintained the code of silence pretty well, I don’t remember seeing.
But I have no doubt that if they — we were caught, we would have. What we did do
though, 1s to — when we could, when we saw there were no guards right around,
who could see it, we would exchange the sabotage work that we did on the
railroads. This was, again, youth, my youth, that I was yo — figures they’re not

going to do this to me, I’m not going to build anything that they can use. And the
others had similar attitudes. So, when we were required to build the railroads, these
— these tracks, put them together, we didn’t always line them up well. We didn’t put
the pins in where they should. And that was with — with some pride, that we did
that. So, when we had the opportunity to exchange something, he — thi-this guy
would tell me what he did, and I would tell him, with delight, that I didn’t put those
pins in there. And we — we felt we were — we were giving it back to the Germans.
So that — that continued, more and more star — started to decline in health. I have —
can I show that shoe? It figured so —
Q: Can — can we cut for just a second? [break] Okay, okay, so we’re rolling. So tell
me, what about — what is this shoe?
A: Symbolic of the torture — the torturous mind, that I also had — had to live with —
physical torture, yes, but the mental, sometimes was even worse. I contracted
frostbite, particularly in my right foot.
Q: Okay.
A: And as we marched on and on, it became more and more painful. My foot was
now exceeding the size of the shoe. And I wanted to scre — yell out, the pain was
that great. I didn’t dare, cause had I done that, I probably would have either been
pushed aside and left to die, or prob — quite possibly would have been shot.

shoe.

that I wore, which was — had been battered around quite a bit.
Q: Okay.
A: So, I-
Q: What does it mean to you, the shoe?
A: It says to me that — it reminds me of what I went through, reminds me of the
struggle that I had, and the struggle that I was able to survive, because this — the —
the — the emotional stress that this gave me, was as bad as the physical. To make the
decision. I’m being force-marched, I can’t drop out. If I do, may be my death. So
what do I do? The pain is so incredibly great. [— I — I—I’ve gotta get this shoe off
my foot. Fortunately, there comes a break.

A: Fortunately, we’re stopped along the way, and we’re forced to sit down on the
side of the road, fortuitous as could be, because I could not have gone any long —

any — any longer. And so I made the decision. That was the emotional tug, do you
take a chance of — of dropping out along the side and trying to get that shoe off? If
they see you, you’re shot. Do you do that, or do you continue, and try to stick it out?
Take the pain, as bad as it is? And then comes this break, that we’re stopped, and I
can now take my shoe off. I take it off, I don’t want them to see it, so I throw it over
a hedge, or some kind of a bush. The only winter garment I have is a scarf. I take
the scarf from around my neck, and I wrap it around the foot. So I have one shoe
and one scarf, and that’s the way I conduct myself the rest of the time that I was a
prisoner.
Q: So you walked on a scarf?
A: I walked on a scarf, on snow and ice. Periodically, we got some sunshine, and
some of the snow would melt, so that became wet. It didn’t help the swelling in the
foot, but at least there was expansion that I didn’t get from the shoe, so I could
survive the pain. And so, that went on and on.
Q: Did they find out that you were Jewish?
A: No.

interrogated me, I would have — I would probably have been required to show my
dog tags, at which time the others, that were attached to them —
Q: Sure.
A: — would have — would have shown. So I had no reservation in that, but once you
become a slave laborer, you’re not — you’re not anything. You’re not registered, and
they don’t care about your dog — dog tags, they don’t care what you are, you just
work, or you die. That’s just as si-simple as that. So ha-had they insisted I — I —I
identify myself, of course I would have. But the fact that I didn’t, what it would
have meant, would I be — have sacrificed my life? I don’t know. Would I have been
sent? Chances are I might have gone to a slave labor camp. Chances are
[indecipherable] something like Berga, where so many of the Jewish soldiers were
sent.
Q: Jewish American, yeah.
A: But that would have been — that would have been a lifesaver. As bad as the
treatment was, the treat — treatment at Berga was harsh, terribly harsh. And — but
yet, I would not have been subjected to the exposure that I — that I was. So that
might have happened.

German. We got to know what they — what they meant. And usually the ri — the rifle
p — the point of the rifle usually was the indication of what we were supposed to do.
Go this way, go that way, get up, up, down, down. They used that most often, but
there were a few German expressions that they use, and we got to know what they
meant.

A: — the next — the next stage. Now the tide of battle turned. The allied forces had
regrouped, they were driving the Germans back. They had to move us faster. They —

camps, that was where — that was our destiny.

Q: Okay, go ahead.
A: There’s one thing I wa — wanted to mention too, that I didn’t, that made travel
during these forced marches, more difficult. Most of the marches were at night. The
railroad tracks were carried at night. Some of them were in the daytime. When they
were, often, we were fired upon by allied aircraft. From 10,000 feet in the air, you
can’t distinguish the s — the soldiers marching, are they British, American, or
German uniform? You can’t tell from the air. And they would fire on us.
Q: Did they ever hit?
A: Huh? Oh yeah, yeah, they hit some. Some were killed. And that was very, very
difficult to take. Even worse — well, I shouldn’t say even worse, but also,
emotionally, what really hit me so much, and maybe the others, the physical aspect,
of course, the danger of being sh-shot and killed was bad enough. But when I saw
those planes finish their run — and mind you, I knew something about the air force,
because we all — I and those who were with me at the time, wanted to become
pilots. And I s — they swooped down, and they — they did their firing. When their
run was over, when they be — they proceeded ahead of the train, then I saw them
make the big U-turn, I knew they were heading back to their base in England.
There were officers in those planes, and I knew they were going to the officers’

couch, warm room, cocktail, food, cigar. Nice, nice life. The frustration in realizing
what they were going to, and we had — I had — had no future at that time. I didn’t
know what was going to happen. I didn’t know if I would be alive, dead, escaped,
whatever. Didn’t know. So that was terribly frustrating, emotionally. It tore at me in
some respects, even more than the physical aspect of it. So now, we’ve co — we’re
continuing, we’re working on these railroads, or sabotaging them, and the tide of
battle does turn. We’re now forced into these cattle cars. All it has, one big sliding
door, no windows, no lights. And we’re pushed in — they’re called 40 and eights.
Eight horses can fit in, 40 humans. We were about 80. We were packed in, bodies
stacked against body. And I knew — some people used to criticize me, on something
so cliché, you said you were packed 1n like sardines? Well, it’s a — it’s a— it’s just
probably the be — most apt description I can give, because just the way they I-lay,
one over another. That’s the way we were stacked. And there was no room to sit.
Once a day, that door would slide open, and they would throw in some crusts of
bread. By this time, we’re all quite weak. It — we couldn’t attack one another with
enough strength to harm, or certainly to kill one another, but we had be — we did
become a—a-—a pack of of animals. We clo — we crawled and clawed our way to
those scraps of bread. As soon as a man got a scrap in his hand, he thrust it into his
mouth; the hunger was fierce. The — we had no — no bathroom facilities, we used

our helmets. You can guess what the atmosphere was like in that car, 80 humans.
Some started to die, some did die in the car. Some wou — became mentally
deranged. Were they out of their minds? I don’t know. But they certainly were —
had no mental stability. And that’s what we lived with for six days and nights.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: So when I say this kind of slave labor is distinguished from any kind of
treatment in captivity, in probably — in possibly any war. Finally, on the end of the
six days, that big door 1s swung open. They pull us out, and now it’s a forced
march. I only have one shoe, and I can’t endure another march, certainly on snow
and ice. I have to make a decision. I always knew that one option was escape, if a
time or situation presented itself. And I said, this is it. We were being — we were put
in — in lines for forced march. I looked and saw where the guards were positioned,
here, here, so forth. It occurred to me that if we came to a curve 1n the road, there
would be maybe five to 10 seconds where we would be — not be vi — we, where we
were situated, would not be visible to a guard. There were two others near me. I
don’t recall that I had any particular connection with them at all, but they were the
nearest to me. And so I told them what I had whispered the — watch, and they made
sure the guards don’t see, and I would call them, when I give a nod, like this. And
we got to that position, when the guards were separated that far, I gave a nod, and

the three of us threw a — threw a — there was a — a hedge, some — something — some
growth of some sort, we threw ourselves over it, and just lay there. I think the
troops behind us, recognizing what we did, used discretion, and said, I should clo —
we should close up. They closed ranks, I think. I’m not sure of that. But the fact that
we were not detected, that there were no soldiers out searching for us, suggested to
me that maybe that’s what happened. And that saved us. So they marched on by,
and they were gone. We had gone through a town while we were on the train, not
too long ago. And we could see through the cracks, there was something there, it
was a some — something, it was not just the treed areas that we had been through, so
it was probably a village of some sort.
Q: So, the train, when you were packed in like sardines, was moving. The cattle car
was moving during those six days?
A: When — when we were — at which point?
Q: When you’re packed into the cattle car —
A: Yeah.
Q: — like sardines, you’re not stationary for six days —
A: Oh, no, no, no, the car —
Q: — it’s moving.
A: — oh, it’s moving.

Q: It’s moving, okay.
A: Mm-hm. Oh, it’s moving all — all of — most of that time. So we — we then decide
to go back into this town, it’s not far away. The other two are able to walk. I was on
twos and fours, the foot, I couldn’t move fast enough on foot, so sometimes on
fours, and sometimes on all fo — all fo — four — fours, my — just my feet. We crawl
into this town, and as we — we’re coming down a hill. I have a picture of it, on back
behind the screen, I have a picture of that town. I never went back. I kick myself
many — many, many times for not having gone back, and you’ll hear in a moment
why I wanted to go back there. But somehow, the story of what I went through, got
out someplace, and in the mail I got two photos of this town, of wise — ri —
Reichenbach.
Q: Reichenbach.
A: Right, r-e-i-c-h-e-n-b-a-c-h, Reichenbach. I get photos, tourist photos of these
towns, from — I don’t know where they came from, somebody, somebody sent them
to me. And I look at it and try to envision where it was we were — I remember we
crawled down a hill. We get to the bottom of it, and I hear familiar sounds. The kind
of sounds I heard on the battlefield, tanks, vehicles, moving. We get closer and then
I see German tanks. I see soldiers all around. We had escaped into a Nazi staging
area.

Q: Oh, good God.
A: If s—1if sighted, we would be shot.
Q: Yeah.
A: That was the order, no prisoners to be taken alive. And so we had to crawl
through back alleys. We — we did that. We’re now at the edge of an alley, there’s a
big open area, and in the distance, there’s some houses. Simple houses. One house
just catched my attention, it’s painted white. And I say to these other two, that’s a
safe house. They look at me. How do you know it’s a safe house? I don’t know how
I know, but I know. So they s — no other choice, all right, we’ll go along. We wait
until we see no — no soldiers nearby, and we crawl as fast as we c — we — they ran, I
crawled as fast as I could, out to the door of that house. We needed some kind of
shelter, it’s still cold. Needed some food. Knock on the door, and a young man,
probably in his early teens, comes to the door. He takes one look at me, you know,
P?’m-—IT’m-—I’m filthy, beard, hair is shaved, I — I contracted lice. And one other
element that we had to fight, lice had covered — covered my body, and many of the
men had that.
Q: Even in those cold temperatures.
A: Even in those temperatures, lice on our bodies. But so my head was shaved. So I
had bristles, I just — just — dirty face, and just torn, the clothes were torn. And he

doesn’t know what to do. Looks at us. And I try to explain who we are, I don’t think
he knew. He starts to close the door. I have one good foot and shoe, I stick the left
foot in the door. And then I hear voices from the rear. They sound like elderly
people. And he motioned for them to come to the door. They do, and it is this
elderly couple. I notice the man takes a look on the jacket, I have a U.S. emblem,
and he looks at it, and there’s a— a smile on his face. I say, what — what — what —
what’s he smiling about? We’re desperate here, and he’s smiling at us. He comes
walking out to the porch, to look up and down, to see if there are any soldiers. He
then takes us — he then motions — he sees no soldiers — if they’re captured — 1-1f — if
—1if—1f the g —1f the German soldiers come by, and we were in their house with
them, not only would we be shot, they would be shot as traitors. In all likelihood,
that’s what would happen. So he has to look out and see if there are any soldiers.
None there. Motions for us to come in, and his wife joins us. She sees our condition,
and almost without saying anything, she goes, I guess, to the kitchen, and she comes
out with three ladles of so — ladles and some — some kind of cups of some sort, of
hot soup, with a piece of meat in it. Perception on her part, she sees the condition,
and she recognizes, more than anything. To us, just seeing a living quarters, it was
so startling. I re — I remember just — just standing there, even before taking the food,
and just looking. There were curtains, drapes, carpeting, furniture, lamps. We

hadn’t seen that in a long time, we were living just in the outdoors alone. So that
was striking. But then, the food was so delect — just absolutely delectable. I —
normally when you’re hungry, you — you gulp it down. But I — I savored it, just the
taste of food, was so great. After they fed us, we talked for a little bit. Amazingly,
they spoke reasonable English. Why did they want to save us? Some years earlier,
this couple had traveled to America. They spent time in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Their experience with Americans, and America, was so good, when he saw that
emblem, that’s what made him smile. And that’s what probably — probably got
them to take the risk of bringing us into their home, and take — and take — you
know, and feeding us. After that experience, they then knew that they couldn’t keep
us there. They got a piece of paper, and they drew a map, showing us alleyways to
go through. We could hear shellfire, not — not small arms fire yet, but we knew we
were fairly close to allied lines. And they knew too, that the allies were near. So, if
they could get us to a safe place, they thought that in a few days, the way the allies
were moving, from reports they had, I guess, heard, or whatever, we would be
rescued.
Q: The two were — who were with you, were American, or not?
A: Oh yes.
Q: Oh, so you were three Americans.

A: They were two — there were — there were three americ — three American boys,
yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: So, they drew a map, and we followed that map, crawled through back alleys, to
—to a barn. We craw — got into that barn, we pulled ourselves up into a hayloft. I
don’t remember how long we were there, two days, three days, just don’t
remember, no sense of time. But I do remember — I think it was a — the first
morning, I heard some scurrying down below. I separated the hay and looked
through a crack. I saw a scene that is as clear today as that — as that scene I
mentioned earlier, of the Germans standing over us with the guns. That is so clear. I
see a stool, I see a cow, and I see sitting on that stool, 1t must have been a German
soldier. Now, he had his top of his uniform off, and I could see that long, white
underwear, extending out of his black pants. Underwear, and black suspenders
stretched over the underwear, and then the big, black boots he was wearing. And
he’s milking a cow. I stirred a little bit, and some hay falls through the crack. This 1s
— this is like a mo — a movie, you know, because — an-and I have to w — I watch, I’m
almo — almost breathless, waiting to see where that — if it lands in front of him, that
hay, he — he — he 1s likely — all likelihood, he is going to know there’s something up
there, and whatever the consequences might be. Might he shoot, might he summon

troops? Whatever it would be, it probably would not be good for us. Because again,
no prisoners taken alive. We were obviously Americans. But it [indecipherable]
behind him. So, it’s of no real consequence, but I have that image of him. Must
have been a day or so later, we’re lying in that hay, and again, aware that we’re not
far from the allied troops, I’m looking down an alleyway, through — must have
been, you know, maybe it’s a knothole, but I s — I can see down there to — down
there. At the end of that alleyway, something goes by — someone goes by, and he’s
wearing a helmet. Could be a German soldier, but then again, that helmet looks
familiar. It looks like our helmet. I’m not sure, and I wait, and I tell them. They —
they — they don’t know whether to believe me, I said, I think the American are here.
You — you’re delirious. You’re delirious, then — they couldn’t be, we’re not that
close yet. A few minutes later, a vehicle rolls by, and I see — [phone ringing]
[break]
Q: Okay, so you think that it’s the American army troops that you see through that
little peephole —
A: I see —
Q: — your guys don’t.

helmet.

Q: Yeah.
A: I think it might well be. And they think I’m delusional, because they couldn’t be
that close yet. A few minutes later, I see a vehicle go by, and it looks like a Jeep.
Not only is it a Jeep, I see that white star on the hood. That’s an American Jeep.
Yes, they are here. This time, they believe me. I say — we roll out of that hayloft, we
literally roll, we’re so weak at this time, and I’m almost deli — delirious. We’re so —
you know, we — the condition we were in. And I remember just rolling down that
alleyway, and there, American soldiers, Third Armored Infantry division.
Q: Excuse me.
A: I don’t even hear it. Fortunately, I don’t. But the Third Armored Infantry
division, again, Patton’s Third Army, the — we were the first Americans they had
come across. They couldn’t treat us with enough kindness. They tried to feed us.
The first thing they thought of — they were obviously not nutritionists, was
chocolate. Bad, very bad. And then, any food they could get into us, they did. I — I -
as I say, I was in very bad shape by then, I was mildly delirious. I couldn’t — I
couldn’t carry on a conversation with them. As I think I mentioned, we were the
first Americans that they came across, so they treated us as well as they could.

Q: Okay, I’m interrupting at this point. I don’t need to go into many graphic details,
but it’s an unanswered question. When you say the chocolate was bad, what was
bad about the chocolate?
A: The sweetness of it, it just — we reacted, the stomach somehow, whatever the
system is, that does whatever it does with your food after you’ve eaten it, 1t just
didn’t take to chocolate very well. It — I think the fact that 1t was rich, instead of just
plain, ordinary taste, probably a leafy vegetable would have been easier to take. But
that made — the other two, I think, were sick, I was just delirious —
Q: Okay.
A: — so I don’t remember what happened. But, the troops almost cradled us in their
arms, because again, you know, we were almost out of — out of it.
Q: You weren’t able to tell them your story, at this point.
A: I couldn’t — I couldn’t — I couldn’t talk, I— I couldn’t — I didn’t want to tell them
anything, I was just, again, semi-delirious, and just hung there. They saw the — the
right foot, with the —
Q: Scarf.
A: — rag wrapped around it, and they knew there was something wrong there. They
rushed me to a field hospital. It was a hospital very similar to, those who have seen
the TV show and the movie, “M*A*S*H.” Field set-up, doctors work — working

under very, very difficult conditions, but providing great, great service to men
wounded on the battlefield. So, I don’t remember where the operation took place,
whether it was in the field hospital — because my mind went blank. I did learn
afterward, that from that field hospital, I was sent to the first general hospital in
Liege, Belgium. And from there, transferred to the first general hospital in Paris,
France. I don’t remember any of that, at all, because as I say, I was delirious by
that time. I don’t remember where the surgery was done on my foot, whether it was
in Liege, Belgium, or in the field hospital. But they did, they had to cut away. The
foot — bottom of the foot was all black, and it would have continued on up my leg,
and I probably would have lost part of the leg. So the timing was just right, and they
— they caught it, but then I spent as — I’d say, a month — a month to a month and a
half, in the hospitals in — in Europe.
Q: So, you lost a part of your foot?
A: Yeah, the flesh of the foot, oh, 1t was — it was bandaged for a long while, and the
flesh had to grow back.
Q: So you didn’t lose toes?
A: Pardon?

I would have lost —

A: — some part of my foot.
Q: Of course. Gangrene sets in.
A: Gangrene, it would have set in.
Q: Yeah.
A: I had both frostbite and trench foot, and the combination 1s wicked, because
trench foot, you know, that’s wet, and then frostbite freezes it, so an awf-awful
combination to go through. But, in this ho — in the hospital, in — in Paris — as I say,
I was there for about a month, they couldn’t get my fever down. In one of the ex —
one of the times when we were in these forced marches, when I was a slave laborer,
twice during that time, at night, instead of sleeping — when I say 80 out of 90 nights,
six of them were in the —

wa — one man who came to be my friend, my buddy, long after the war — we
correspond every Christmas, we send greeting cards to each other, and Myron
would send me — Myron Berringer(ph), a farmer from Rushville, Indiana. On that
card he would always say the same thing, year after year after year, things sure
aren’t like they used to be. And all of that. Myron called me over, lie down
[indecipherable] under the cow, under the udder of the cow. He milked directly
into my mouth —
Q: Oh my gosh.
A: — from that cow. So, along with 20 other diseases I contracted — out of that little
brown book that I mentioned before, where it has the 84 foods?
Q: Right.
A: I have about 20 diseases, illnesses, fevers that I contracted during the 10 months
of hospitalization. One of them was undulant fever. Now we didn’t — in the hospital
in France, in Paris, they didn’t know what it was, but I had a raging fever. It was
caused by that incident with the cow, it was undulant fever. No doctor, no military
doctor was able to discover what it was. That kept me from going — getting back to
America, because they couldn’t — they were going to fly me, which they did, I — I
flew in a hospital plane. They wouldn’t do that until they got the fever down, and
they couldn’t get it down. Finally, they did force it down enough to get me on a

plane and over to America. Years | — years later, I— I — I finished college, I’m
working now, and I broke out in a sweat. Like the body just opened, water just
poured out, and these little red dots all over. The doctor called it petechiae, and this
was a result of that incident. How was it discovered? The doctor that I — I had that
night, was substituting for another doctor. He was young, he was an intern, and he
immediately saw — thought that I had a contagious disease. And I was — and he
ordered an ambulance, they took me immediately, that night, from home, to 1 —
Belleville, New Jersey, to a — a hospital where children with polio were. It was an
isolation hospital. And I was put on the isolation floor, with these children. I was
there a full month. My wife Shirley could only see me during that month, through
glass. I was isolated because he thought that I had this contagious disease.
Q: Did you?
A: No. No. Fortunately, the doctor in that isolation hospital was very thorough, and
very smart. He said, you have this raging fever, and you’re going to continue to get
these attacks. We have to find out what you have. We — so he says, I’m going to ask
you a lot of questions. And he was so thorough. He took me through the whole
campaign.
Q: Did he really?

that you have something that’s called — well, whatever feve — Ill think — PII think
of it in a—1in a few moments. But you have that disease. Now, it’s a
Mediterranean disease. But, I said, I wasn’t in the Mediterranean. He said, but it
also — this was a very intelligent doctor — it also can be contracted from
unpasteurized milk. And that is the disease you have, and we can treat that with
certain such medication. He did, and he cured me of it.
Q: And you’ve never had it since.
A: Never had — never had an attack again. The — I just can’t think of it.
Q: So, you were — you had the operation at one of those three hospitals that you
mentioned to me?

Q: The — one thing that I wanted to ask you is that you mentioned earlier, your
brother Lester figured in some way in your story here, in your experience here.

A: Okay. When I — in the ba — in the bulge, when I was captured, I was reported as
missing in action. Standard procedure, a telegram from the War Department to my
parents. And months go by, these three months go by, and there’s no word. I
learned later on that my mother had a nervous breakdown, because the assumption
was, if he’s missing in action, after two month — two months [indecipherable] and
there’s no word, he must be dead. So that was the — the a-assumption. There’s a
man in charge of communications, another soldier, an American soldier in charge of
communications for another unit, perhaps another — probably another di — I think
another division, and a company within that division, he’s the communications
person. When the report went out that I was missing in action, he learned of that. He
started to send communication to other units in the area, have they come across a

radio contact with troops through that area, he got word that I was alive. I have the
original letter now, right behind me, that he wrote to my parents —
Q: Lester did.
A: You can guess — it was my brother, my eight year older brother Lester, who had
followed my route as a slave laborer, maintained the contact, so that when I did
show up in a hospital, reported alive, he was among the very, very first to get that
information. And he sat up that night until he couldn’t think any more, and wrote to
my parents. And I have the original of that letter.
Q: That’s amazing.
A: The — the — the odds of something like that happening, the first man to learn that
you were alive, happened to be your own brother. With millions of troops —

of communications. But it turns out, the one who cared for me as a child now, is the
first to — to have pursued the search, and then to learn that his brother is alive.

A: Now, the war in Europe ends, and many of — many of the soldiers in that war
are now assigned to units going to Japan. He was assigned to go to Japan. So
while all this is going on, he’s on a boat. He’s — he’s — he’s on a boat going across
the Atlantic first, then he has to cross country. Before he gets — I’m not — not chu —
before he get — gets to battle any — any battle station, the war with Japan ends, and
so he’s free to come home. And he — I don’t ne — I don’t remember — I don’t
remember how we first became — he’s — how he saw me. I do remember that my
parents came by, and I was so misshaped. My f—I remember, I was in a private
room because I was — many serious illnesses, and so I — I was in this room, and the
door is open, and from what I learned later on, my father looks in that room, sees
me, and just goes right on. Doesn’t recognize me at all. You know, the — obviously
the face is sunken, and slightly distorted. I have no hair, because it was shaved. So I
don’t look like the one he remembers. Many of our relatives who came past the
door too, never recognized me. I think my mother did. I think, you know, mother’s
instinct. I think she — she — she did, but that was the beginning, of course, of 10 — of
nine more months of hospitalization.

A: — one of the boroughs, on Halloran General Hospital. It was a military
hospital, at the time.
Q: Were n— when were you in shape — did the army ever ask you the details of
what had happened to you when you got missing — when you went missing?
A: I-
Q: Were you ever debriefed, in other words?
A: When I was debriefed? When I — not overseas, when I was in the hospital over
here, a military officer from — came from Washington to interview me, but the
interview was more about the war crimes commission, because I witnessed a killing
of an American soldier. As I’ve said, 1f you were unable to work, you were either
left to die, or you were shot. There was an American soldier who could not get up.
He was just that weak, that sick and this German soldier takes out a gun, shoots
him. I learned later that this German soldier’s name is Eisenhauer, spelled h-a-u-e-
r, instead of o-w-e-r. Somebody — I don’t remember how I learned it, somebody
told me, because he was a notoriously bad actor, and so be — I— so I gave testimony
about that incident. I don’t think I talked about my conditions. I don’t — don’t recall
that I talked with anybody na — na — officially. I just don’t recall. Though, while I
was in the hospital, I remember being awarded the — the Purple Heart, and then a
second award, with oak — the Oak Leaf clover, and then raised in rank from PFC to

corporal. So, the — you know, there was procedures, and officers came by, and — to
do the things while I’m — while I’m lying in bed, and all that. But I just don’t recall
anybody questioning me —
Q: About your experience.
A: — about the experience. I don’t remember at all. And that’s why I ne — I never
talked about it, for all those years, it’s 53 years —
Q: Excuse me, let’s cut the camera, I’m so sorry. [break] So, yes, you said that —
was there anybody, or — put it this way, who was the first person you ever really
told what had happened to you? When was the first time you did that?
A: Actually, I — I— I deviate from what I — what I’ve said to you, that I never talk
with it — talked about it. When I got back to college — I’m trying to remember the
name of the unit, but they were a bu — a bunch of old men. And they — they met in,
you know, there — there — there are groups that meet. And I think I told you that
when I got back to college, I had been interviewed on —
Q: Right.
A: — network radio, and all of that. And — and so there was — there were people
there on the campus, who knew the experience that I went through, and something
must have gotten out to this senior men’s group, and all that, so they asked me to
come to speak. The problem was, first of all, I didn’t know what I was talking

about, you know? I hadn’t really — really, really pulled together my — my — my
experience over there. But, I did — did talk to them and tell them. The problem was
that most of them couldn’t hear what I was talking about. Some of them had — you
ever — in — in — in those times, there were still some who used ear trumpets.
Q: That’s right, that’s right.
A: And — and what’d I say? And they couldn’t quite get it. And I guess that was
when I decided that nobody’s really interested, and I — I don’t want to talk about it.
Why I to — and I just gave a few — a few highlights, that I was a soldier, and I fought
on y — but I—I didn’t go into any of the details at all, about it. Was just a—a
soldier’s s-story. But that was the only thing, and from that point on, that was when
I decided, it’s not pleasant, I don’t want to talk about it, and I f— 1 —I stopped, for
53 years after that, I didn’t — but wa — over here, when did I decide that I should be
talking about it? In this room, my — I had two grandsons have, at that time they
were seven and nine years old. And one of them said — we’re sitting here, and one
says, Poppy, were you in the war? And then, between the two of them, they fle —
throwing questions at me. What di— where did you sleep, what did you eat? Did
you have a gun? Did you ever fire 1t? Did you ever kill anybody? And just
something is triggering in my mind, as I say, my guess, if these kids are asking,
maybe I should be talking about it. In 1988, Shirley and I, we had set up a

foundation at Ohio University, to bri — well, it was b — bl — bla — based on religious
lines, to bring religious elements on campus, so there should be no anti-Semitism
and so on. It was a very — a very good thing We f — and so we founded this — this
organization. One — in ni — 1n 19 ay — in ninety — we did it before that — in 1988, we
invited Elie Wiesel, Elie Wiesel, to come to campus for a weekend, to talk. He
agreed to do it, because there was a woman, a young woman, a student, a graduate
student, who had written, and — a — a—I guess her — her papers for her degree, on
Elie Wiesel, on either hi — one of his books, or on his life. She died a short time
afterward. It was — it was an unfortunate illness, from something she ate. He was
aware of that. I don’t recall how he was made aware of it, but she was someone
special to him, and he was made aware, perhaps by his rabbi, who had been a rabbi
at Hillel [indecipherable] University. And when he and — when he — and he agreed
to come, but only on the condition that we memorialize her name. And so he came
to the campus. I don’t have to tell you — oh, he insisted on certain things being done.
One, that he speak [phone ringing, break]
Q: So you were talking about Elie Wiesel.
A: So — w-w — So w-we — so he — he is the weekend guest, and of — and — and
Shirley and I are also the guests, of the president of Ohio University. We — the
president’s guest house is turned over to us. Elie Wiesel has the master bedroom,

his rabbi has another bedroom, and there’s a third bedroom for Shirley and me. Elie
Wiesel comes to me, he says, Bob, take the be — master bedroom. I said, I — I — oh, I
—I-—Icouldn’t possibly even fit — think of doing that. That’s your room. He said
no, no, no, listen to me, believe me, take the master bedroom. We do. Next morning
—and so we go — go to bed at night. The next morning, we come down for
breakfast. We had ordered — this 1s a little town, we’d ordered from a — a — a larger
city in Ohio, kosher food. Comes the breakfast, he eats a few grapes, you know, he
doesn’t eat much of — much at all. He eats a few grapes, and all this kosher food that
we brought in, from Columbus, Ohio, nothing. He eats nothing. But he said, I hope
you slept well. I said well, you gave us the room. I said, did you sleep well? He
said, well, he said, I didn’t — I didn’t stay in the — 1n this building. Wh-Wha-What —
wha-what — where did you go? He said, there was a little motel down the road. He
asked somebody to make arrangements for him to go to the motel. They didn’t have
any rooms vacant. He had a little hole someplace. There was room enough for his
typewriter and him, and I guess maybe a place to lie down. I said, you spent last
night there? Why? Why would you do that? He said, I didn’t want to wake you up.
What do you mean wake us? He said, I do my writing, a lot of my writing —
Q: At night.

Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
A: — at mid — in the mid — middle of the night, in the morning, 2:30, 3:30, any time
like that. He used a typewriter. He said, if I were writing at night, I would keep you
awake. Imagine this man, I would keep you awake. So I went out of my way to go
down to this little motel, I spent the night there. I was pleased, and I could do some
writing. He slept very, very little. My guess is probably maybe three, four hours a
night, at most. Ate very little. And —
Q: Quite a story.
A: — it was a — but this aft — huh?
Q: Quite a story.
A: Incredible, the per-per-personality of — of — of this man. So here we are, now it’s
Saturday afternoon. We’re in the living room of the president’s guest house. There
are three people there, Shirley, me, and Elie Wiesel. And I’m — I’m really
mesmerized by him. I am not — up to that time, I still had not, other than that thing
with the el-el-elderly group, I had still not talked, and I didn’t want to talk. If there
was anybody I suppose I should have talked with about my experiences, I guess it’s
Elie Wiesel. I think I was intimidated, or either that, or I didn’t think it would be
very important to him, based on what he had gone through, and what he had done.
And so, I never talked about it with him. But just being in the room with him, and
talking other things with him, was, you know, I mean, a — a — a thrill beyond

July 14, 2015
anything I can imagine. When I was influenced by the two boys, I attribute it also,
the fact maybe that sm — meeting with Elie Wiesel suggested to me, just as he had
been talking about his experiences, maybe I should be doing th — maybe I should be
doing the same thing.
Q: Did Shirley know everything?
A: No, I don’t think I ever talked with her about it, no. She only learned while we
were d — writing the book.
Q: Wow.
A: Although that she did go to a lo — so — a lot of the presentations that I talked. So
she learned, she learned that way abou — about it. And occasionally, you know,
we'll be having dinner or something, and something would occur to me, and I
would make some reference to the war. But — so — so, I think, when the kids started
talking — and then I’m thinking Elie Wiesel, and then I reali — I —I realized, we
have a Holocaust council here in the — in our federation, and Holocaust education 1s
mandated in New Jersey. Now, I’m not a Holocaust survivor, but I survived maybe
the equivalent to sa — to most of the survivors, and maybe — maybe in some sense,
maybe even worse. Not those who went to the death camps, of course, nothing
compared with that. But at least, may — and maybe — maybe this is a story that
should be preserved. I didn’t know it was unique at the time, and I really didn’t

know until Heidi became my editor, and she did a lot of research, and the man in
charge of — of th — of press for the city of Newark, was also a World War II
historian.
Q: Yeah, you mentioned him to me.
A: I mentioned him. And so he di — he did a lot of research too, so he — he thought
there was something unique about it. But an-anyway, it was that combination. And
then somehow — and I don’t — I don’t know how, the head of our Holocaust council
got word of my experience, and induced me to start talking to the school kids. So
when I learned that that’s what they were doing in New Jersey, so these young
people would grow up as being witnesses for the future, that seemed an imperative,
and that’s when I decided, time to start talking. And if you don’t — may — make you
feel any happier, I don’t hear that over here. You feel — remember, you feel it. Oh,
dear. So that was the — that was what urged me.
Q: And that was 50 year — more than 50 years later?
A: Oh yeah, that was 53 years later, that I started talking.
Q: So that would have been like 10 years ago, you would have started talking?
A: I’ve been doing it for about 10 years, right —

Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
Q: One other thing that I want to ask is, those 90 to a hundred days, what was
different about the person who came out of that, than the person who went into that?
A: Was a totally different individual. I went — I went in as a—a—as a kid, very
unsophisticated. And I knew something, because I did read newspapers, did know
about the war, and about concentration camps, and things of that nature, and a little
bit of politics. But — but I was really very, very unsophisticated, and had no
particular design on life, I didn’t know wha-what I wanted to be. So, very unsettled,
I was still a student, and that was — that was all. My Jewish life was pretty much set
by my mother, so I knew I had to go to synagogue, even though it was done in
extreme form, like a Orthodoxy, and all that. But my shi — but my mother insisted,
and I was brought up, you know, as a — as a good Jew. But when I — af-after going
through what I did, I don’t know what the maturation design was, but when I lie in
—1n the hospital bed for those 10 months, I had many sleepless nights. Now, a lot of
them were because of physical conditions, and the pain was such that it was hard to
sleep. But the others were just emotional, I — just thinking, thinking, thinking,
constantly. Some of that thinking would go back to incidents that took place during
the war. I constantly had an image of this elderly couple. I had an image of the
helmet of that sergeant, and I kept reaching for — trying to — trying to get his face.
And I couldn’t — couldn’t — couldn’t get away from — from remembering that, and

what — what — what I went through with him, and how — and the great good fortune
that I had, that it happened to be somebody like that, who was a humanitarian, as —
as — a-a-as well as a— a good soldier, I guess, and you know. He recognized valor,
a-and so, I — I had thoughts about them, and some of the instances, sometimes I
would get an image of that tank, like an ogre, a big monster, with that cannon. But
more — more often though, my thinking was about the future — wha — wa — what ha
— how — how — how — wha-what-what 1 — what is ordained, what am I supposed to
do? I mean, it’s — it’s — it’s going to be a total change. Sure, I’m gonna go back to
school, then I have to go to work, and all of that. But my life, somehow, it just feels
very, very different. I’m not the person I was before. I’m much more mature, for
one thing. I was a kid when I went in, now I’m reasonably mature, and I start to
think. I was very, very lucky, as — as when I — when I talk to senior audiences, very
often men will come up and surround me, and say, your life was a miracle. You —
you should have been killed many, many times, but you’re still here. So that — that
thought ran through my head, and there was something urging me inside. I— I don’t
know what it — I don’t know what it was, but I— I knew I had to respond in some
way, to what I had been through. And that some way happened to turn out to
devoting the rest of my life to Jewish causes, Jewish interests. When I was 83, I had
my second Bar Mitzvah, which is in the book, incidentally, my second Bar Mitzvah,

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
136

Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
how that — how that came about. It’s — it’s quite rare. Very, very few Jewish men
have a second Bar Mitzvah.
Q: What is the purpose of a second Bar Mitzvah?
A: The purpose of it is, back in — in David’s time, bibli — [phone ringing, break]
Q: So, you were saying —
A: According to the psalms —
Q: Okay.
A: In King David’s time, longevity was considered to be 70 years. If a man lived
beyond 70, he started life all over again. And so, 70, and recognizing that the age of
Bar Mitzvah for boys 1s usually 13, so you figure, if 70, life begins again, 13 years
added to that, 83. So at age 83, a Jewish man becomes eligible for a second Bar
Mitzvah.
Q: And how does that change from the first Bar Mitzvah? What’s different?
A: Oh, it’s a world of difference. It’s a to-totally different world. It’s always been
my belief that 13 may be a little bit too young for a boy to understand the ritual that
he was going through, and the me — what it meant to become — because you
assumed new responsibility in life, a more mature responsibility, and you’re
responsible for your actions, and your future. And you — I —I find that hard, at 13,

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
137

Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
to be able to think that way. So 83, not only you have — you’re well beyond that
point —
Q: Right.
A: — you’ve been thinking — thinking of your — your life, and planning for many,
many years. But your whole perspective on life is different, because you’ve had a
life experience. In my case, I had an unusual life experience, the military life, and I
had a ga — an interesting Jewish experience, too, because my family, my mother
was rigid about it. We were not Orthodox, but we were Reform, but nevertheless, it
occupied a big, big part of her life, and became part of my life.
Q: It’s like an identity.
A: So a ritual was important. Pardon?
Q: It’s an identity, it’s the forming of an identity.
A: Exactly. I had — had a strong Jewish 1-1-ident — identity. So that I knew that I
wanted the thing — to do things spiritually, but more in terms of aiding pe — aiding
people. If I survived what I did, there are other people who had difficult times, and I
ought to be able to do so — do things that would be helpful to those people. The bar
— Bar Mitzvah was more symbolic than anything. It allowed me to restate my — my
—my Jewishness.
Q: Yeah.

Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
A: And, as I say, 1t had meaning, it would — had me — real meaning. It was the first
time I had read from our sacred Torah. And that had a lot of meaning, because when
I was 13, in Reform congregation, we didn’t — the boy didn’t read from the Torah.
This was my first opportunity to do that. So I learned to read Hebrew without the
vowels underneath, and you had — were either experienced, or were very adept at
learning how to do it. And I did learn. It was my wife Shirley, who came up with
the idea. She said, Bob, you’re 83 now, you know, you could — you could have a
second Bar Mitzvah. I'd like you to have it. And so I did it, to a large extent, for
her, because she wanted it. We had a rabbi at the time, who — who agreed — agreed
abs-absolutely. And I spent sessions with her, preparing for it. And we — it was the
most — probably the most exciting event in my life.
Q: Oh my.
A: Well, I guess I have to say, second to my marriage. But — but it wa — 1t wa — it
wa — So exciting to be — now I felt more totally encompassed within the realm of
Jewishness. The things that I did in life, first of all, I— I became president of two
synagogues, and wherever I went, we were so deeply involved. Shirley every bit as
involved, and you see in her obituary how totally committed she was to Jewish
causes. She sat federation boards, women’s division boards, worked for
organizations that were nationwide — Jewish nationwide, worldwide. Served on the

https://collections.ushmm.org

139

— on those boards, and on committees, and all that. So, totally engaged. Well, that
was my — my role, too. I assumed the presidency of the state association of Jewish —
all Jewish federations in New Jersey, there were 16 at the time. You know, those
kinds of roles.
Q: And you think — yeah — you think that if 1t hadn’t been for this experience, that
your life probably wouldn’t have taken that direction?
A: I think that is probably the case. I— I would not — I do — I—I don’t see how I
would have had any opening to that. I knew things about Jewish life, and Jewish
philanthropy, that I learned only late — later on. I didn’t know as a — a youngster,
and maybe I never would have come across it. The fact that I became president of
Hillel, a Jewish international organization, did help me a great deal, in
understanding that a Jewish life is important, and saving j — other Jewish lives is
important, too. So, when it came time to set up different type of operations, I set up
— I —I-congregational life was — was important. I sat on a number of different
boards. I did fundraising for United Jewish Appeal, because that money went not
just to people in need, an-an-and in many ca — 1n some cases, not even to just
Jewish causes, cause many of the things that we did as Jews, went for the public at
large. Many of our operations are required even by statute in the state, to serve other
people’s needs. Jewish family service, Jewish vocational service. Social service

July 14, 2015
agencies like that do provide services to people who are not Jewish. So, that was
what I was committed. One of the places I — I became very much involved in, was
the Daughters of Israel Geriatric Center. This was a home for the aged. I had aging
parents. I ha — I— I got to know the age — the aged there. They had lived full lives,
now they were in the last stages of their lives. I served there for about 15 years, I
was vice-president there. So — but getting to know them. So one of the kinds of
things that I set up, with another member of our Jewish community who had owned
some department stores and all that, we decided we wanted to do things for elderly
people, the late stages of life, and many of them had given up life. The retirement
age — and I think it may still be today, still recognized, when you’re 65, back in
those days, when I was a youth, that was automatic, 65 you closed the book, no
more work, you retired, and lived the golden years. I never have found out what
those golden years are.
Q: And you’re age what? Ninety-something now?
A: Huh? Yeah.
Q: How old are you now?
A: Ni-— ninety-two.
Q: Amazing. Amazing.

141
Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
A: But I never found out what the golden years are. I — I realize in some other
people’s minds, it becomes stopping work and just enjoying yourself. You know,
travel, go see your grandkids, take vacations, things of that nature. Those are the
golden years. But I saw people in housing, senior housing in New Jersey. They
were not Jewish, just Jewish based. These were people who had given up on life. I
developed a program that would hand — may enable them to re-reengage with life,
reinstitute things that they had done earlier in their lives. Some had been great
cooks, some had worked in the industry, some had been musicians, and all that. But
now, you’re over 65, so you stop doing all of that, and in the process, you lose the
essence of life. You still have some years ahead. And so I wrote this program out,
and my par-partner, he and — he had access to people who would fund it. We got the
funding, developed. That was a non-profit corporation. We didn’t charge for the
services. We went throughout New Jersey, to homes for the aged. The experience
was not lectures, I didn’t lecture to them, but there were big charts they had on the
wall. And each of them would go to their chart, and they would plot out — I would le
— give them leading questions, what were you — and they — and those questions
brought out their interests in life. What things that they did before. Some of them
were musicians, they gave that up, some were great-aunts and uncle — whatev — but
whatever it was that they were interested in life, some were great cooks. Whatever

they did, which they were doing no more. So they plotted that out. And I—I go —
guided them through that. And many of them adopted new careers, absolutely
careers. The most — probably the most dynamic one in all of them was a Holocaust
survivor in a home for the elderly in Cranford, New Jersey. A Holocaust survivor
was just waste — sitting out her — her closing years. And she was only about 65.
Q: Oh wow.
A: And she was re-ready to just —
Q: Pack it in.
A: That’s it. That was it. She didn’t talk. I don’t think that — I don’t know that
anybody else there knew that she was a survivor. But that came out. One of the
leading questions that I would throw at them —
Q: Right.
A: — brought it out. This was part of her life experience. She then started to talk
within — with the group, started to talk about her experiences, which she had never
disclosed to anyone. Some months after that series of seminars, I got a letter from
her. She had found a new life. She was speaking, not to Jewish — Jewish
organizations, the YMCA. Those were people and children who wanted to know
about this thing, too. They knew there was something like a Holocaust.
Q: But what was it, and —

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection

143
Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
A: But what was it? They had no idea. And they knew there was a war.
Q: Yeah.
A: Course, they got a little exposure to that in school, but what was the Holocaust?
And so, she was invited to many places. The place there wa — the Young Man’s
Christian Association [indecipherable], and places far and wild — wide. And so she
wrote me this letter.
Q: That must have been so gratifying.
A: Oh, I mean, those are the kind of things that were so, so gratifying. And — and
that’s — that’s the kind of stuff I’ve — I’ve done ever since. Raised a lot of money for
Jewish philanthropy and all, but —
Q: So, I wanted to turn in a little bit different way, but taking from this route of, you
know, how life changed, and how — what kind of a person it made you, through this
experience. Did you have conversations with God, while you were in captivity? Did
you have any before? Did you have any after?
A: I don’t know about during captivity. It’s always been my belief that I’m a
mortal, and I don’t have access to God. But I learned, through reconstructionist
Judaism, when — when I decided we wanted to go that route, and I took a whole
group, and we formed a new congregation, I learned that there’s a spark of God —
when we are created, all of us, all the human being, there’s a spark of God in each

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection

144
Interview with Robert Max
July 14, 2015
of us. And you can do something one way or another, with that spark. And I’ve
always looked to that spark. Now, that wasn’t during — during the war, because I
had not been exposed to reconstructionist Judaism yet, and I — I didn’t know about
that. But I did appeal to some something, beyond mankind. I didn’t know what the
force was. I didn’t think I had the right to talk directly to God, but I appealed for
some kind of help, support. And then, as I got to know later on, then I — I — I reali —
but in the hospital, there was a moving force. I could never identify what it was,
something with — inside me, it’s a quality, a character — each person has some kind
of character within him. It was a character in me, I think 1t might have been an
essence of guilt. The fact that I came through. Not the fact that I sacrificed so much
with the danger, and the torture of living as I did, and all that, but a feeling of
maybe guilt, that I— I — I was blessed. There are a lot of people in life that are going
through torment in their lives. May not be what I went through, but 1t may be the
loss of a family member, it may be a — a sickness, that your — your — you’re
confined to. Whatever it is. But that’s where my leanings ought to go, whatever I — I
—I can do that will help other people, you know. It sounds like pie in the sky.
Q: No, no, no. I mean, this is very real.

[indecipherable], she was very social. She did wonderful things for — for the kind

of organizations, I did, too, but she was very social. I — I’m not that — that kind of a
person. To me there must be purpose. And I think that was a word that would
describe most anything. There’s a purpose in life, and I have to find what that
purpose is, and always fulfill that purpose. I couldn’t do it just sitting around a ca —
a — and drinking beer with — with the guys at night. That didn’t serve any particular
purpose. But, sitting at a table, meeting with a group of people, functioning people,
who were doing good for some organization, an agency, social service agency, or
any other type, that felt right to me. So, always purpose in life. Your meeting, your
— your time. Your time is worth something. Use it in some good way. Just lounging
around isn’t going to do anything for anybody else, and in the process, doesn’t do
anything for you too — either. So there was some self-redemption that came out of
it. Some — something selfish, yeah, I would get something out of it. And I do, and I
have. When I leave one of those schools, and I see these kids come up to me and
talk, and tell me about their grandfathers, and all that, and then I — I get the letters
from them, and they say, your story was so real, I— I went home and I talked to my
parents. I’m going to talk about it, just as you said, I will talk about it with people,
as long as I can. I — oh, kind of remarks like that, that’s what moves me. Social
context just don’t. So that — that was — that was what evolved, and if you ask me to

describe it clinically, why that happened, I couldn’t. A psychologist, psychiatrist
might, but I’m not sure they could either.
Q: Oh, this is why I asked from the spiritual perspective. It is — it is —
A: Spiritual yes, preserving Judaism, because I got — even though I’m not — I’m not
very well informed on it, but from all that I have read, and all that I learned about
what Judaism stand for, it’s all the good things in life. And it’s — it’s — it’s dealing
with mankind, and it’s devote — devoting part of your life to mankind. All the — all
the — th — the good — the good things we do for one a — one another, man’s — I’m
trying to think of a title of a book — man’s search. Oh, this great — great — oh, just
can’t think of his name. His — his book, a book that he wrote some time ago,
‘“Man’s Search for Meaning.”
Q: Is that Viktor Frankl?
A: That’s exac — exactly.
Q: Okay.
A: Great.
Q: Okay.
A: Great. Viktor Frankl.
Q: Oh yeah.

A: I read his book. I read that very book of — of his, and that — that struck me. Just
fairly recently, this maybe a year or so ago. And I said — and I—I wrote, and I
wanted to put it in the text. And Heidi and I went over it. Didn’t — somehow just
didn’t quite fit in the — in the text. Was a little bit too emotional. But, whatever. But
that gave me the rationale. I said, Frankl, what he preached, way back then, that’s —
that — that’s me. That’s — that’s what I became. So I was a di— a disciple of him — of
his. Didn’t know him, didn’t know his work.
Q: But it spoke to you.
A: He spoke. He must have spoken to me, yeah. So — and that — that became my —
my remaining life’s work. But helping others find meaning in their life. That’s the
meaning in my life, 1s helping others find meaning in their lives. And that’s what he
— that was the theme that he — he preached. And the fact that he was a concentration
camp survivor himself, and went through all that. And his experience, when he saw
people who gave up, Jews who gave up on life in the camps, others who pulled
themselves through, by maintaining that conviction about life. And he, of course,
was one of them. But oh, that — that experience.
Q: It’s pretty powerful.
A: That did it.
Q: Yeah.

A: I’m glad you remember his name. When — when you get to be 92, that happens,
face it. It’s on the tip of my tongue [indecipherable] just won’t come.
Q: Well, I want to say, I’m very grateful to you for speaking with us today, for
sharing your story with us today, for sharing your thoughts as well, and your
reflections on it. And I’Il say that, for this part, this will conclude the formal part of
our interview with Mr. Robert Max, the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum interview with Mr. Robert Max, on July 14", 2015, in Summit, New
Jersey. Thank you very much.
A: Thank you.
Q: Okay. And now what I’d like us to do, is get the letter, and have you read the
letter from your brother.
A: Oh.
Q: And so, we’ll disconnect — [break] So, I — I wanted you to be able to read the
letter that your brother wrote to your parents, on learning of your rescue. So, I pass
the floor to you, please.
A: Okay. It’s dated Germany, April 26, 1945. “Dear Mom and Pop, I’m so happy, I
could cry. Just a few ye — hours ago, I received a letter from European theater of
operations headquarters, telling me that Bob was okay. Here is the first paragraph
of the letter: Dear Corporal Max, I’m very happy to report that your brother, PFC

Interview with Robert Max

Robert R. Max, ASN 15311529, was liberated by our advancing forces, from a ger
— German — from a German prisoner of war camp, on 4 April, 1945, after having
been previously reported as missing in action on 4 January, 1945. I’d previously
written to Bob’s company clerk, and his answer was written before the report of
Bob’s liberation was received, at Sixth Armored Division headquarters. So, along
with the letter from ETO headquarters, came a letter from Sixth Armored, dated
eight days earlier, stating that there was no further news of Bob. The letter read, in
part, PFC Max was with his company as they attacked enemy positions, about one
and a half miles northeast of Marvie, Belgium, on je — on 4 January, 1945. An
enormous amount of armored enemy artillery, mortar and small arms fire, was
encountered, and squads and individuals became separated at times, because of the
necessity of seeking protection from this fire. After this engagement, PFC Max was
not present. A search was made of the vicinity, but he could neither be found, nor
accounted for, and up to the present date, there had been no further information on
your brother. Well, further information came today, and I don’t think I’ve ever
received anything that made me happier. Captain Budrogy(ph) informed me that all
prisoners of war, for more than 30 days, are returned to the United States. If that is
so, there is an excellent chance of your seeing him soon. I wish I could, too. If he is
going to be reassigned, I’d like to get him into my outfit. Better still, I'd like to see

him stay in the States. I intend asking Captain Budrogy’s(ph) advice tomorrow.
What can I add to a letter like this? I’m overjoyed, and can’t think of another thing
right now. I know how happy you both must be, and I know now that God must
have heard your prayers. All I can say is that we have a lot to be thankful for. Call
Diana when you receive this letter. I’m too excited to write any more tonight. When
I calm down, I’m going to write Bob at Central Postal Directory, APO 640, U.S.
Army, and within few days, I’m going to send you the letters for safekeeping. Right
now I want to enjoy them myself. Write soon, and God bless you. Love to Ruthie.”
Q: Lovely. Thank you very, very much.
A: Yeah, that — I can imagine the emotions under which he wrote — wrote this. I-I-It
wasn’t easy, because again, the relationship was that genuine, that he felt this kind
of deeply, and he, like my parents, thought that I wa — I had been gone. But he kept
up the search, and eventually —
Q: He found out.
A: — he found out, mm-hm.
Q: Thank you. Thank you very much.
A: Ah, dear. It’s — it’s — it’s — it’s a privilege to real — to — to do it, leave it in some
other permanent form, and itll be recorded in here. I don’t know how long this
piece of paper will remain, it’s getting pri — pretty thin now.
