It was so lovely, it\u2019s -- the first time, of course, we were together. And then we were also some weekends, I think, together. And they saw that my husband repaired everything, whether it was on the roof, or whatever was to be repaired, he was very handy. And I, of course, cleaned the house. So we got the key. Until six -- 69, we -- my whole family went there. We always spent all of the holidays there together, the whole family. They came from New York, the Streichers with the -- then with the children, afterwards with the grandchildren. We had the house all the time, very seldom they went because they had a yacht, where they were in summer. In winter we couldn\u2019t, in the -- when it was snow.

They [indecipherable] another to -- pupil to ask me, would you care to use my car? I go on the cruise. So we had a car of another pupil. I thought that the [indecipherable] were terrific to us, really terrific. To let the house have us. All the time we were there. They moved then to Maine, so got -- first they lived on Brattle Street.
