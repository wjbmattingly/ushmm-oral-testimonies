In preparation for this interview, I watched the videotape of the interview you conducted with the Holocaust eyewitness project of Washington, D.C. in 1989, and listened to part of the audiotape interview you conducted with the Jewish Community Council of Greater Washington on March\u2018 1985. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in those interviews. Instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on those interviews and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side A. What was your name at birth?",

But when we stopped at our \u2014 in our train because the railroad tracks were bombed, we couldn\u2019t go \u2014 excuse me \u2014 much farther. So what had happened, while we were waiting there for repairs, the SS had this speech to us, he said hey, you ought to be very happy, because this is April 20\", 1945, it\u2019s Hitler\u2019s birthday. And we, we were thinking why in the hell should we be happy that it\u2019s Hitler\u2019s birthday? But of course he said we will give you an extra piece of bread to celebrate it. And no sooner did he finish as the whole sky became black and we were actually bombed. Our trains were hit by the allies. Not direct, but next to it.

And we ran over to him and he said, don\u2019t worry, you are free. And that\u2019s how we actually were liberated, which was already like not exactly April 20\", because it took us like two days longer. But apparently, the Russians were already there. I always say, had the Germans left us in that camp, we probably would have been liberated by the Americans, because I think where we were liberated was almost very near where the Americans and the Russians met, near the Elbe river."

The only thing what they did for you, we would go to them and say take \u2014 let\u2019s go to a German bakery with us. And they would go with us and they would requisition from the baker, bread for us. So we \u2014 and we, our type of eating was very crude. Bread and water, that\u2019s all we needed, you know, to keep us alive. So that\u2019s what we got, we got mostly bread and water. Because even when we got into a German house, even if we saw some food there, you know, because what was happening after the war, a lot of German households became empty. Why? Because the Germans were afraid of the Russians and they were running towards the American zone. So they left a lot of their homes with no one there. So when we would go in, we would find maybe some food over there. I remember in one place, they had to spe \u2014 these beautiful, you know, like fruits, apples and cherries put in in jars, like we put away sometimes fruits. We were afraid to eat them because we thought that maybe they poisoned it. So we wouldn\u2019t even touch this.

Like we would sleep where the horses would sleep in \u2014 in some kind of \u2014 what do they call them, the barns, like. Or the pigs, or some others, because we were actually very much afraid of \u2014 of raping, because during the war, you see, 1-in Germany, I never worried about being raped by a German, because this was something that they were not allowed to do.

First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very \u2014 from the bombs, she was a little bit more in \u2014 and sh-she \u2014 you know, like she lost a couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us. You know, like I had a little bit of a 1-injury, you know, like a shrapnel? A piece of shrapnel got into my hand, but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, I never felt it. You know, it wasn\u2019t dangerous for me. But with her, we had to put her in in a hospital. So she actually stayed in the hospital. We couldn\u2019t, you see, we couldn\u2019t keep on staying in the same town for too long because we were actually afraid of this. So we actually had to leave her in the hospital, but there was another friend that she met that stayed with her. So she was like more or less taken care of. But we kept on going and probably took us probably like about three weeks til we got to the Polish border. And when I got there \u2014 and you know, as you were walking \u2014 you see, when we were liberated, would you believe that most of us didn\u2019t realize that most of our families were murdered?

But that was, in a way, kept us \u2014 hey, you stay alive because you promised that we\u2019re gonna meet at home. You know, like my boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, when they were separate \u2014 when they separated us in Auschwitz he said to me, if we stay alive, just remember, meet me in mine hometown. But also, he didn't know that my mother told me this, when we were, you know, it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said, just remember, if God forbid we should get separated \u2014 you see, never thinking that what\u2019s going to happen, that it\u2019s going to be this mass killing, but just separated. If we go, maybe I was someplace else or something, she says, remember, after the war, we\u2019ll meet in our place, you know, in our home.

You\u2019re afraid of a little horse? I mean, he was that \u2014 he probably w-wa \u2014 I wish all through the war I would have had the dealing with the horse and \u2014 other than with the people. I said, and you\u2019re afraid? So they were afraid to go near the horse, so I was the one that fed the horse, I was the one that took him in \u2014 now I probably wouldn\u2019t know how to deal with it, but at the time, you know, when your life is at stake, or whatever it is that you have, I came to the conclusion that human nature, you would do what you have to do for survival."

And this girl grabbed me, she says, let \u2014 g \u2014 run. And she and me started running. And where do we run? There\u2019s no place where to run. We run into where the ghetto used to be in Radom.

And as a matter of fact, I didn\u2019t even stay, that same night I was going to spend the night in that center, but I found a cousin of mines who actually was already there. She just came down to see who else was coming, because she actually was able to take back her apartment. She came back with a stepmother and she, when she saw me, she said, don\u2019t stay here, you can come and stay with us in our apartment. So I went with her in the apartment.

And I watched, for the first time in my life, I watched the people of Prague, the way they were greeting their president. They were hanging out from their windows and they were \u2014 with such love and I figured, if people can have so much love for their president, that\u2019s how much I knew about \u2014 you know, it somehow \u2014 I always say, with g \u2014 all going through all that war, I still, when I was liberated I was still this Pollyanna, what they used to call me when I was a kid, that I could never see any bad in other people. So here, I looked here at these people greeting the president and I turned around to say, they must be wonderful people. I never knew about Czechoslovakia except what I learned in the history books. I mean, after all, when the war broke out, I was 13 years old, how much did I learn about other countries, you know? But I always was \u2014 loved, you know, geography and history. So I knew a little bit about them, but I didn't know about them, but I didn't know about nature of people. But when I saw them greet like this, I said you know, we should stay here. But you know why we didn\u2019t? We probably wouldn\u2019t mind. Because we heard that you had to be born there in order to become a citizen \u2014 to be a citizen. Otherwise, if you weren\u2019t born there, you never become a citizen. So we were worried.

So I\u2014 I understand that he actually saw to it that some of the borders were opened. You know here, right, we thought that we did such a act that we were able to smuggle ourselves into the other country so easy, but it \u2014 apparently this was maybe already as a fact.

So that\u2019s what we wanted to do, and the next thing we knew, we came into this, like what they called it later, displaced persons camp. It was called Foehrenwald, which was near Wolfratshausen. It was like about 15 kilometers from Munich.

However, I am not as religious or adherent to the kashrut, to being kosher as much as I was then. Because I found out that you can live and it doesn\u2019t have to be everything exactly kosher. And \u2014 and besides, I myself \u2014 had maybe my parents lived through, I would have kept it on for them, because somehow older people stick much more to it.

So no, this they definitely changed me this way. But as far, they couldn\u2019t kill the spark for Judaism and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s whether because I was so young that it really \u2014 like it, like went above me. I-It didn\u2019t touch me as much. I always say, when you were a young kid, you don\u2019t have the \u2014 the bonds with your family are not yet so complete that you can cope with \u2014 with these thing a little bit better than let\u2019s say, older people. I always say that had my sister survived, let\u2019s say you know, my sister actually had a choice, you know, she didn\u2019t have to go with her baby. They actually wanted her to say that this baby isn\u2019t mine. Because you see, they needed her in the \u2014 in the camp. They liked to staff the camp with the doctor, a dentist.

And you can imagine, if she would survive a-and she had to live with something like this. I mean, you can\u2019t do that.

I\u2019m sure I must have seen it, but you know, a kid looks at a picture of some uncle that lives in New York that she never saw, didn\u2019t pay any attention. But I picked him out. I walked over to him, and sure enough it was my uncle. But my uncle was a tailor, he had a tailor shop in Manhattan. Had one of the finest tailor shops in Manhattan, he and a partner. They used to make clothing for J. Edgar Hoover. I mean, in those years when we came over to this country, my uncle\u2019s suits used to cost like about f \u2014 between 500 and seven - 800 dollars. I mean, unbelievable. Everything was handmade. So when I came \u2014 and of course I found my uncle, he showed me how to use an electric sewing machine, I never used it. So when I came to Washington, I already knew how to use an electric sewing machine, so I knew, so I actually got a job right away at that place here, and then I switched to another place and I worked til my daughter was almost born.

They all \u2014 most of them are professionals, or if they are not, they do something, they\u2019re really very worthwhile citizens. And the way she put in that book \u2014 but this book that she went on this journey, I think she must have come to terms with her mother or whatever, because she went to find from where she came and she found out that her mother wasn\u2019t such a horrible person, and she made that up, that she was, in her mind she assumed that because her mother, you know, maybe didn\u2019t do certain things for her, that she figured all the kids of survivors are no good. So I had a little bit of a problem, but no, I \u2014 as a matter of fact, I would love to get ahold of that book.
