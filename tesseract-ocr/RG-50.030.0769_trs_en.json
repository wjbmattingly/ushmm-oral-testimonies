And I and another guys were able to get some old guns. I had a old American western Colt, about this size.

And then, of course, we saw the four guys coming towards us, about 20 feet ahead of us, and they saw what was happening, so we started running.

And then, on the way back, we're told not to go through \u2014 near the station, because the German were arresting people left and right. And next day they killed 20 women and children on that spot.

And you have things happening, which shouldn\u2019t be happening. People being hurt which shouldn\u2019t be hurt. And I think it\u2019s the \u2014 for example, the scout movement, which I think 1s extremely important in training the character of the young people, is being maligned. There\u2019s many high school kids, who when they try to be patriotic, or \u2014 or \u2014 are being discouraged for \u2014 or \u2014 or even thrown out of school for carrying flags, or saying \u2014 believing in God, or in \u2014 in\u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n things which are good, and higher, and which will prepare them for \u2014 and \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Julian Kulski m September 25, 2014 an-and not spoiling the children. I think it\u2019s a terrible thing to \u2014 just because the parents have an easier life, they make it so easy for the children that they go and look for satisfaction with drugs, and smoking and sex, and \u2014 and \u2014 and all kinds of bad things, because they lack ideology. And I think they\u2019re starved for the ideology. And I find that when I talk to the groups of young people, they are just starved for my words, they \u2014 because they don\u2019t get it at home, they don\u2019t get it in school."

On the other hand, I think there\u2019s still enough adults and teachers, who are teaching history, recent history. For example, when I was there last month, I saw 100,000 young people doing a marathon on the day of the Warsaw uprising. There were three days of festivities; theaters, plays, movies.
