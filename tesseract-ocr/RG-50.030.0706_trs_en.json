And then what happened 1 \u2014 th that was 1947 \u2014 \u2019\u00b048, the infl \u2014 at that time, the influence of Soviet Russia was tremendous. Why? Because that goes to polit \u2014 politics. The Czechs always felt that the west let them down. Th-The \u2014 the che \u2014 the \u2014 the west means England, not the United States, the United States was out of this world. But England, France, partially Italy, that instead of helping the Czechs, so to speak, maintain their Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Frank Hyde oe May 4, 2013 identity, freedom, they let them down, and then in turn, Hitler marched in, and the whole situation has changed. So the Russia influence was very strong. We, Georgine and me, we didn\u2019t care for it, because we have seen what happened when you don\u2019t have freedom. We both survived Auschwitz, we came back in 1945, and were living in Prague as best as we could have done it, until \u201947 - \u201948. But when the situation became very, very difficult, we didn\u2019t like it. We thought again, we might have to go through the same thing. Maybe not the extremes, but hardly the freedom which we were hoping for. Well, we decided to get out of Czechoslovakia, which was 19 four \u2014 late \u201947, early \u201948. I couldn\u2019t get out, because I was, quote, military age. So I thought that if I somehow split with Georgine, that by myself I will be easier to get out than two of us with luggage and all and that stuff. That\u2019s how we thought of it. Well, I met somebody by the name of Hyde. His name was Walter E. Hyde. Through him, I got a English passport. So Georgine left Prague in February48. I couldn\u2019t get out that quickly. In the meantime she went from Prague to London, stayed in London for a while. From her mother\u2019s side, they were here, surviving the situation in Ecuador. Now, of the f \u2014 all these countries, I\u2019 Il tell you why Ecuador. That was Georgine\u2019s uncle from her mother\u2019s side; he was a dentist. But he didn\u2019t care for dentistry, he was more like a businessman sitting on the board of directors here, sitting on the board of directors there. And somehow he became http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Frank Hyde oS May 4, 2013 consul general of Ecuador. Well, how he got Ecuador, I can\u2019t tell you. But that\u2019s how it was. So it was \u2014 unfortunately, the situation became worse, before Hitler and all that stuff. He was trying to convince Georgine\u2019s mother and father to go to Ecuador because he was able to give them the visa to go to Ecuador. Well, my mother, you know, they were in a different situation. They had a house like a house, and those days there were no mortgages in Prague. So to leave your house, to leave your business, that was unheard of. Why should I go to Ecuador to listen to those idiots down there, or something? This is my home. Well, unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work out in the long run, but since they survived in Ecuador, in Quito, they came after the war here, like most of people usually do. So when Georgine was in England, she heard, of course, of her aunt and uncle, that they were here \u2014 they were in Ecuador at that time. But they know they were living in \u2014 in Ecuador. They came here and that uncle of hers had some earlier connections to somebody who was a manufacturing person. And because of the Cold War which existed already at that time, somehow the United States government was pumping much more money into Puerto Rico, as a prevention that Puerto Rico wouldn\u2019t go too much left, like some of the countries did."

They tried to reunite families who were split, you didn\u2019t know where \u2014 last time saw him here, last time you saw him there. So it was very difficult, but the French were helping.

And, before Hitler came in, she decided, with the husband, to go to, at that time Palestine. There was no Israel.

Anyway, so when the order came to get inside those boxcars east \u2014 but you have to realize, that was not Germany of the 1940s, that was Germany of a defeated country. The railroads were ripped up from the bombing of the United States. So the transportation wasn\u2019t like that you hop in here and you wind up there, no. It was very difficult. Not for u\u2014 I mean, we were just prisoners, and we had to do whatever we were told, but it was not so easy for them either. So we were traveling for two days, eastward. Then we came to a place in Germany, or maybe western Poland, or something. Next to us was a train with German soldiers. They were heading west, we were heading east. It\u2019s like that, okay. I was like this, they were on this side. So my particular boxcar, we were told to get out of the boxcar so that they could count how we are still in the boxcar are living, because some people are die out of hydration, age, malnutrition, sickness. So they always counting. So while we were standing alongside our railroad car, next to us was a German car, right? I mean, the British bombers came by, and they started to dive, and started to shoot. Now, you know when you are up there and you starting to shoot, you don\u2019t shoot like this, you shoot like this, you know? So that you kill as many opponents you can kill. So there was a panic at that moment. We were out of the car. So, we \u2014 wi \u2014 wi [indecipherable] if you want to call it free. That\u2019s not the right word, but no supervision at that moment. So that was a hill, and I always call it Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Frank Hyde . May 4, 2013 the same like here. You know, you have a hill behind you, and you had to run up the hill, because you wanted to get away from the shooting. So we were \u2014 remember, I was \u2014 1945, I was what, 24 years. So, you had the different stamina to run than you would have now that I\u2019m 91. So we were running up. When I say we, there was always somebody who was closer to you. I remember one guy, his name, but I don\u2019t remember the other two who were running, Czechs, with us."

Eventually they hit the train. So there was a tremendous commotion. But we wound up on the top of the hill. So that \u2014 what are we going to do?

But you know, the \u2014 during that kind of a situation that\u2019s happening here to someb \u2014 not want to touch that that base, but when people \u2014 my father-in-law, when \u2014 when they heard that this one was transported to some camp, and this one \u2014 so, as a precaution, they gave \u2014 they had a housekeeper of the house, which was living in the basement, so to speak. So they gave her some money. How much? No idea. He had a factory. Remember, the time goes back now, \u2014 70 years. So plastic was a novelty. So, in Czechoslovakia, when you had \u2014 when you bought a drink, let\u2019s say like a Coke. Was not a Coke, like a Coke. So it has a top that you closed, you know, but it was the old-fashioned thing, which was very difficult and maybe not nice looking. So he did a lot, with a partner, plastic \u2014 you know \u2014"

Well, there are lots of people who didn\u2019t come back. In that connection, I would like to refer to a story which appeared in \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u2019 not more than maybe two weeks ago, and I gave it to Elise to read. Why? Because it turned out that New York state, there are unclaimed insurance policies, monies which were left around in banks. In the bill \u2014 b \u2014 in the billions. And the story was that New York state can get this if it stays unclaimed, because there is a law, if you don\u2019t claim X after so many years, it becomes the property of the state. So naturally, New York state, I can imagine if they could get a couple of million, perhaps billion, oh my gosh, you know?"
