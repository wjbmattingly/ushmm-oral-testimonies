In the streets and then after Kristallnacht when the others were transported you know to god knows what destinations. My father was contacted by some Aryan friend of his or formerly friends and now Aryan. But they were still friendly and was told that he had to leave the country by December 31\u201c', 38.

But we also needed a document called an unbedankleischtide [ph] to get out of the country which had to be gotten from the Nazis and which wasn\u2019t available so quickly. We might not have it by December 31\u201c. So we decided, my parents decided to split the family up. And so that my father and my little sister who was adorable would go on New Year\u2019s Eve and try and cross the border because the guards would be drunk. They thought. And we would stay and wait for the paper and then see if we could exit properly and perhaps ship some of our stuff overseas and so await us later on. At any rate they did proceed accordingly. In the meanwhile the people from -- the cousins helped us get a visa into Cuba, which was obtainable at that point by depositing $500 per person as a guarantee in Cuba and sending us tickets to go to Cuba.
