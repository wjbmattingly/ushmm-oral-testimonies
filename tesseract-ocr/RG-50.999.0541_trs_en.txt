>> Edna Friedberg: Good morning. Come on. You can do a little better than that. Good morning. Let's
have some energy.
>> Good morning!
>> Edna Friedberg: Thank you. Welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. My name
is Edna Friedberg. | am one of the museum's historians. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the spring
season of our First Person program. We are in our 16th year of First Person and our guest today, our
honored guest today, is Dr. Alfred Munzer whom you will meet in a few moments.

The 2016 season of First Person is made possible by the support of a number of generous
donors, including the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation and the Helena Rubinstein Foundation but
particularly today the Arlene and Daniel Fisher Foundation. We are very pleased they are with us today.
So if you could just wave.
>> [Applause]
>> Edna Friedberg: We love having this program. We are grateful.

First Person is a series of weekly or sometimes in the busy season twice weekly series of
conversations with individuals who survived the Holocaust. Each of our First Person guests serves as a
volunteer here at the museum. So they are talking not only about what their personal experiences were
but how they came to be connected with this museum and what it means to them to have you line up
outside and come to hear about their lives.

Our program will continue through mid-August. If you have friends who are coming to town
and would like to see the schedule, please visit our website to find the hours. We also have a podcast
series and we are posting videos of these programs. You can look in the coming days and weeks to
see if you would like to share a recording of this program with friends at home. Please look on our
website.

Additionally, inside your program booklet is a card that says Stay Connected. If you would like
to hear about these and other programs that the Museum does including possibly in your community --
we do travel around the country with exhibits and public programs such as this one -- please fill out the
card and we would be glad to add you to our e-community.

| will ask you -- I'm sorry. If you do that you will also receive an electronic copy of Al's
biography which will enable you follow up on some of the details that you will hear today.

| ask you to please silence all electronic devices right now. Thank you.

A little on our format. Al is going to share his first person account of his experiences during the
Holocaust with us for about 45 minutes after which we will be sure to save time for your questions. So
please keep those in mind as we go on.

To begin, we prepared a brief slide presentation. We begin with this very cute picture of Alfred
Munzer as a little boy. | want to explain a little bit because it's a particularly appropriate photograph for
today of all days. Today is a special day. Tonight marks the Jewish holiday of Purim on which children
dress up in costume. And by coincidence, we didn't plan this but when we scheduled Al's talk today,
this photo is a photo of Al dressed for Purim on that day. He's holding a charity box, which is to raise
money for the Jewish community in Israel. It says the Jewish National Fund. And he is dressed as that
box as well. Today he is not but there he is.

This beautiful, beautiful shot is a photograph of Al's parents on their wedding day. Simcha and
Gisele were married in 1932 in The Hague, in the Netherlands. They had three children, Al, baby. The
photograph of their three kids, the beautiful girls, Eva and Leah, and Al in between.

For historical context so you understand, the backdrop of which Al's life unfolded is that of
World War II. On this map you will see the arrows indicating that the German Army invaded The
Netherlands in May 1940, which, as you will hear, is actually before Al was born. Immediately life
became difficult for Dutch Jews. And these invasion routes show not only The Netherlands but into
France and across low countries, Belgium and Luxembourg.

Al survived, thanks to the courage and generosity and love of a man that we see here named
Tole Madna. Tole Madna was an Indonesian immigrant. For those of you who are less familiar with the
history of Indonesia, it was formerly a Dutch colony. So there was an Indonesian immigrant community
in the Netherlands. And that is why you would see a face here not what you would think of as a typical
Dutch rescuer. We will hear more about that in our conversation.

Al spent the rest of the war, first years of his life, in hiding in Tole Madna's home. He was
cared for by Tole's Indonesian nanny, pictured here on the left, a very extraordinary woman named
Mima Saina. Al is on the right, in Tole's arms. We will hear about them soon.

After the war, Al came to the United States with his mother, in 1958. He learned English. He
went to college. He went on to medical school and became a very accomplished pulmonologist. |
always embarrass him because he's modest but he eventually served as President of the American
Lung Association. So a man who has devoted his life to service. He remains deeply involved in
antismoking efforts around the world, working with the WHO, World Health Organization, to implement
an international treaty on the control of tobacco.

We at the museum are very fortunate to be the beneficiaries of many of Al's volunteer hours
as a speaker, as a translator, giving tours. He and his spouse are cherished members of our
community.

With that, | would like to ask you to join me in welcoming Dr. Alfred Munzer.
>> [Applause]
>> Edna Friedberg: Thank you, Al, very much for joining us today.
>> Al Munzer: Delighted to be here.
>> Edna Friedberg: Let's begin at the beginning -- actually, before your beginning. Please tell us a little
bit about your parents and your family background.
>> Al Munzer: Sure. Well, my parents were born in Eastern Europe, a part of the world that was part of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire and which after the First World War became part of Poland. My mother
was born in a small town called Rymanow, and my father in a neighboring town called Kanczuga. They
were childhood sweethearts.

These are tiny little shtetles, as they are called but nonetheless, | always like to tell the story
that one of the people who came from my mother's little hometown, from Rymanow, was Isidor Rabi.
Isidor Rabi came to the United States, became a physicist, and ended up being awarded a Nobel Prize
in physics in 1946 for the discovery of electromagnetism. So here you have a very prominent Nobel
Prize winner coming from one of those tiny towns.

But opportunities in those towns were very limited. After those towns became part of Poland,
after the end of the First World War, there was also a lot of anti-Semitism. So young Jews typically
would leave their homes and seek their fortunes in a larger city. That big city with a lot of attraction was

Berlin. My mother had two older siblings who lived in Berlin and so she joined them in the 1920s. That's
when she came to Berlin, before she finally joined my father at the end of 1932, in Holland.

My father, on the other hand, came directly from his little hometown to Holland where he
started a men's clothing business in the Netherlands.
>> Edna Friedberg: And there's a sign still in place. Right? Is there not?
>> Al Munzer: Yes. To my great surprise -- this was a few years ago. We were walking around The
Hague and came to the house where | was born. We lived above, in an apartment, and my father's
business was downstairs. And there was still this sign of my father's business in the portico, a beautiful
glass sign. An incredible shock to see that, a direct connection with my father, which, of course, | really
did not have very much otherwise.
>> Edna Friedberg: So your parents came to Holland leaving, trying to escape from persecution, and
being an intolerant place of opportunity. What did you know from your mother about what life was like
for them in Holland during the 1930s?
>> Al Munzer: My parents made many friends in Holland. Most of their friends were not Jewish. Jews
had lived in Holland for hundreds of years, were fully integrated into Dutch society, and my parents fit
right in. As | said, my father's men's clothing business flourished. He did very well. They had many,
many friends.

Among their neighbors were two women, one of whom | especially remember. | called her my
Aunt Jo. She was a very devout Catholic woman. After the war, when | first met her, she would show
me notebooks written by one of my little sisters. So she was really -- just this woman was so intimately
involved with the lives of my parents that she had actually these notebooks and could tell these stories
about my sisters.
>> Edna Friedberg: Speaking of your sisters, when did your parents start a family?
>> Al Munzer: Well, my oldest sister, Eva, was born in 1936, July 1936. | usually like to explain that
while people were having these very happy circumstances in Holland, trying to live normal lives, just a
few hundred miles away the Nazis really came to full power. So, for example, on the day that my
parents -- very close to the date my parents were married was the day when Adolph Hitler had
approached the aging president of Germany and was made chancellor of Germany starting the Nazi
era. That was just about the same time my parents were married.

And similarly, my sister Eva was born just as the infamous Berlin Olympics were held, which
Adolph Hitler, of course, turned into an instrument of Nazi propaganda. So you have the juxtaposition of
a very happy family event and then just a few hundred miles away the increase, the rise, really, of the
Nazi era.

And then two years later, in November 1938, is when my parents celebrated the birth of their
second child and that was my sister Leah. That, too, corresponded to a horrible event in Germany
because my sister Leah was born just two days after what is commonly called the Night of Broken
Glass, Kristallnacht. It's the night when the full fury of anti-Semitism was unleashed in Germany and
hundreds of synagogues were ransacked and destroyed and thousands of Jewish businesses were
plundered.

So, again, a very happy occasion in Holland. And while my parents must have been worrying
about the relatives they had left behind, especially in the case of my mother, her older brother and older
sister who were still living in Berlin at the time with my parents celebrating this happy occasion of their
second child.
>> Edna Friedberg: September 1, 1939, Germany invades Poland, sparking World War Il. As |
mentioned in the introduction, the following spring The Netherlands is invaded. What can you tell us
about what this meant for your family and other Jews?
>> Al Munzer: Well, my mother has described the events of what happened as to the invasion to me.
On the night of May 10, 1940, my parents had been asked to shelter a man who was a member of the
Dutch resistance movement. He supposedly carried a briefcase, my mother told me, which contained
plans to preemptively destroy the railroad center in the city. The Dutch resistance felt if they could
destroy that railroad center it would slow down the German invasion.

That morning, my parents and their guest listened to the radio and heard that the port city of
Rotterdam had been bombed and destroyed. And a few minutes later Queen Wilhelmina of the
Netherlands came on the radio and announced, basically, that Holland had surrendered. She called on
their citizens to do their duty wherever they happen to find themselves. My mother told me that the first
person to speak up was the man who was a member of the Dutch resistance movement. And he said,
in Dutch, "Thank God, it's over."

As far as he was concerned, he would just have to accommodate to living under the
occupation but he could be satisfied that he had tried to do what he could to start or stop the German
invasion. But for my parents, as they looked at their two little children in a playpen at the time, they
realized that they were going to be all alone. And they knew what had happened to their relatives in
Germany and in Poland especially. They knew they were going to be all alone and that things were
going to change very rapidly.

And, indeed, in very, very short order all of the restrictions that had been put in place on Jews
in Germany were put in place in Holland. The first thing that happened, my mother told me, was a ban
on the ritual slaughter of animals for kosher meat. And it's something that some people felt, well, that's
a pretty benign thing, nothing very serious. Maybe some people would even view it as, quote, humane.
But that was just the first step of isolating the Jews. The next thing was the Jews had to take on a new
middle name: the men, the middle name Israel; women, the middle name Sarah. They had to register
their property to make confiscation ultimately much easier. And they had to register, of course, as Jews.

The other regulations that were put in place were much more restrictive to their personal lives.
Jews were prohibited from using public transportation, my mother told me. And they were prohibited
from going into public parks. That led to a particular incident with my mother, actually. When you have a
regulation that doesn't make much sense, like being prohibited from going into your neighborhood park,
you ignore it. So my mother ignored the regulation and she took my little sister, Leah, in her baby
carriage, to the park, a neighborhood park. One day a German woman approached the baby carriage
and my mother's heart, she told me, almost stopped. And then the woman looked at the baby, my little
sister, the blond curls and blue eyes, and she turned to my mother and she said, "Uh, you can tell that
this is good Aryan, German stock." And my mother, of course, had a sigh of relief, thanked the woman,
and never went back into that park again.
>> Edna Friedberg: In fact, your parents actually enrolled your sister in a Catholic school, did they not?
>> Al Munzer: Yes. |'m not entirely clear about the timeframe that was but | do have photographs of my
sisters being enrolled in a Catholic school to hide their Jewish identity. I'm not sure whether that
happened before my sisters were placed into hiding or afterwards but it certainly was an attempt to hide
their Jewish identity.
>> Edna Friedberg: Early in 1941 your parents realized something surprising, that your mother was
pregnant, with you.
>> Al Munzer: That's right.
>> Edna Friedberg: Tell us what your mother told you about that time.
>> Al Munzer: Yeah, early in 1941, as the family tried to go on with their normal lives, my mother found
out that she was pregnant again. And she consulted her obstetrician and he told her in no uncertain
terms that she had to have an abortion. He told her that it would be immoral to bring another Jewish life
into the world.

Now, my mother wasn't particularly religious at the time but she turned to the Bible for advice.
And my mother told me that she read the story of Hannah. And Hannah, you might recall, was a woman
who was desperate to conceive and would go to the temple every year and pray that she might have a
child. And she made this pledge: If God will give me a child, | will give the child, that child, to the service
of God all of the days of his or her life. And it was in reading of Hannah's desperate desire to have a
child that my mother decided that she could not possibly have an abortion. Her obstetrician fired her as
a patient. And so November 23, 1941, | was born at home with the help of a nurse.

>> Edna Friedberg: And in addition to the profound leap of faith and fears your parents must have had
to bring a new Jewish life into the world at that time and place, eight days later they did something else
extraordinary.
>> Al Munzer: Yes. Because traditionally little Jewish boys are circumcised in a Bris, a ceremony when
they are 8 days old. And my parents’ friends advised them very strongly, well, don't have him
circumcised; it will identify him as being Jewish. But this time the answer to my parents’ dilemma came
in the form of the worried look on the face of a pediatrician who had just examined me. And my father
turned to the pediatrician and he asked him, "Is there anything wrong with the baby?" And the
pediatrician said, "No. It's nothing serious. It's just that your baby needs a minor operation that we call a
circumcision." And so my parents told the pediatrician of our Jewish tradition and eight days later our
family gathered probably for one of the very last of ceremonies in Holland, really the first milestone in
the Jewish life for the Bris ceremony. Like any other family, they had photographs taken at the
ceremony. They were very small photographs, actually. At least the only ones I've seen. And it shows
the whole family gathered in the living room and a second picture with me on a pillow.

What's special about those photographs is that they were only about 1-by-1.5-inch in size and
my mother was to keep the two little photographs hidden on her body through her subsequent state in
12 concentration camps. She developed this feeling, this superstition, that if she ever lost those
photographs, it would mean that | had been killed.

Fortunately my mother survived, the photographs survived, and, of course, | survived. And
those photographs, of course, are so fragile, so valuable, that | did not want to keep them in the house.
And that's why | entrusted them to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and they are now
part of the story of this museum.
>> Edna Friedberg: Thank you. And it is a sacred duty for us to care for them. So thank you.

Over the first 10 months of your life things became increasingly dangerous for Jews. In the
Netherlands they were forced to wear yellow stars, riskier and riskier every day. Your parents
eventually became convinced they needed to go into hiding. Tell us a little bit about how they arranged
to do that.
>> Al Munzer: Well, many of you may be familiar with the famous story of Anne Frank, another Dutch
family, Dutch Jewish family, that went into hiding. Of course, they went into hiding as one unit. But my
parents decided, like many other families, that as a form of insurance so that if one person was taken in
the family and was killed at least the others might survive that we ought to split up.

The first to go to hiding was my father. He had received a notice to report for labor duty in a
camp in Holland. He knew that that meant eventually being sent to a camp much further east, as they
were called at the time. So he was the first one to go into hiding, pretending to commit an act of suicide
which gained him admission to a psychiatric hospital.

Then my mother, through the intervention of two -- the same aunt, our neighbor, Aunt Jo, as |
said, was a very devout Catholic woman, and she put my mother in touch with two priests, a Father
Cummings, and Father Ludders, [ph] and they, in turn, told her about a woman who had had a dream in
which she saw the Virgin telling her to take Jewish children into hiding. And so my two sisters, Eva and
Leah, were placed with that woman with that very devout Catholic woman. And that's when they really
assumed, you know, their Catholic identity even though they may have attended a Catholic school
before.

That left my mother alone with me in our home. My mother described being extremely
frightened being alone in our house. She was afraid of the doorbell ringing because she thought it might
be one of the German soldiers coming to the home so she dampened the clapper of the doorbell. And
then, of course, she spent the whole night watching the clapper because it wasn't making any noise, to
see if it was moving. So this was just the incredible tension that she felt being left alone in the house.

Jewish boy children were more difficult to place but finally a neighbor of my mother, a woman,
Annie Madna, agreed to take me in. And so my mother took me to Annie who lived right across the
street from us. But Annie had had some run-ins with the Nazis herself so she first passed me on to her
sister. And then it turned out that the sister had a neighbor who was a member of the Dutch Nazi Party

and she was afraid that they might hear a baby crying so she returned me to Annie Madna. And then
finally Annie Madna passed me on to her ex-husband. She had been married to an Indonesian man,
Tole Madna. They were divorced. She passed me on to her ex-husband. And that's how | came to be
with Tole Madna.

At that point my mother joined my father in the same psychiatric hospital, hiding, in her case
pretending to be a nurse.

So | was adopted, for all practical purposes, by Tole Madna and especially by the nanny who
had taken care of the three Madna children earlier. Her name was Mima Saina. She was an Indonesian
woman, completely illiterate, sooke no Dutch, couldn't read or write, only spoke the Indonesian
language, had come to the Netherlands to do work in a restaurant which Papa Madna, as | used to call
him, Tole Madna, was manager of and eventually she became the nanny for his children.

This woman, who was illiterate, had a heart of gold. She would literally walk miles every day
just to get milk for me. | was in the home completely illegally and everything was very, very strictly
rationed. So you had to have coupons for any kind of food that you wanted. So if you wanted milk for a
baby, you had to have coupons. And since | was in the home illegally, there were no coupons. So she
had to scrounge around even to get milk for me.

Actually, a few years ago | was in Holland and a woman approached me and said, “You know,
you used to drink my milk.” And | said, “What do you mean?” And she said, "Well, all school children in
Holland were given a little bottle of milk every day. And my mother told me to save half that little bottle
for the baby next door. And you were the baby next door." So here you have a 6-year-old child
participating in saving another life.
>> Edna Friedberg: If | can interrupt just one second. Your sisters were not physically hidden, though. |
want to make sure that the visitors understand that you could be hidden in the open and you could be
visually, literally, hidden.
>> Al Munzer: Yes. They were hidden quite in the open, actually, as Catholic children, attending
Catholic school. In my case, | was not allowed out of the house at all. There were only two little kids
who were allowed to come into the house and play with me. They were neighbors, the neighbors' kids.
And the reason they were trusted is that they were Germans but they were communists. They were
German communists. So they were very anti-Nazi. So they were thoroughly trusted to come into the
house and play with me.

I'm told that | slept in Mima's bed and she kept a knife under her pillow, I'm told, vowing to kill
any Nazi who might try to come and get me or even, she said, kill me rather than have me fall in their
hands. An amazing, amazing woman.
>> Edna Friedberg: When you describe the Communist neighbors, the little girl next door, it's just a
reminder of how tenuous the situation was for you and for children like you, how it took networks of
trust.

| would invite you, if you have time today, down the hall on this level. We have a special
exhibition called Some Were Neighbors, and it's exactly about that, about the connections between
friends, co-workers, teachers and students, all the personal relationships that could allow a small baby
or an adult to survive.

Al, as a parent, it's hard for me to imagine the trust that your parents had to have in what were
essentially strangers. What contact if any, did they have with you, with your sisters, with their rescuers?
What did they know?
>> Al Munzer: Well, my mother -- my parents knew the Madna family quite well. They all lived in the
same neighborhood. Papa Madna, after the war, always prided himself that he had a suit that came --
that was made by my father, actually, his workshop. So, you know, there was a really good connection
and they were really trusted.

My parents did not know the woman who had agreed to take in my sisters very well. And that
ended up being a major problem because about a year later or so, after my sisters were in hiding, her
husband, the husband, announced his wife was hiding two Jewish children.
>> Edna Friedberg: So he turned her in.

>> Al Munzer: So his wife was taken prisoner, along with my two sisters. His wife eventually was freed
but my sisters, who were then 6 and 8 years old, were taken to a prison first, near Holland, a building
my mother could never stand to look at again. It was a real problem for her after the war because she
knew that that's where my two sisters had been taken. They were then taken to a Dutch concentration
camp, and then almost immediately shipped to Auschwitz where they were killed. February 11, 1944.
They were 6 and 8 years old at the time. So there you have the two completely divergent stories.

The memories that | have of being with the Madna family -- there aren't too many memories. |
was much too little, 9 months old, when | had been left with them. So | have very few memories but
they are fun ones, happy ones. | remember Papa Madna playing at the piano. | remember Mima
singing lullabies to me. | remember one time getting very angry, actually, at my two foster sisters. They
were doing their homework and writing. So I, as a little kid, like any other kid, tried to imitate them. |
took a pen and started scribbling. And they all broke out in laughter because obviously the scribblings
made no sense. And | got very, very angry because they were laughing at me. It was one of those few
memories that | have.

But there were other memories. | remember, for example, having to go into hiding into a small
cellar. But even that was a happy memory because the one thing that stands out was playing with all
the Christmas decorations that were hiding there. And that's the thing that stands out. So my memories,
you know, of those years were very, very happy ones.

Now, my parents, interestingly enough, were allowed one more visit with my sisters before my
parents were also deported. And that was for Christmas Day 1942. That's when my two sisters were
taken to the psychiatric hospital where both my parents at that point were hiding, my mother a nurse,
my father as a patient, and there was a mini reunion of the family then. But three days later the
psychiatric hospital was emptied of all patients and staff and they were all deported and taken to a
concentration camp.
>> Edna Friedberg: So they could not know that would be the last time they would see their girls.
>> Al Munzer: Absolutely. No. No. There was still that hope that eventually there might be peace.

After, my parents were taken to the same concentration camp that | mentioned earlier,
Westerbork, then to another concentration camp on Dutch soil called Vught where they both did slave
labor for the Philips electronics company. And my mother described being in that concentration camp
where there would be a morning line-up every day at about 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. She says one day
Heinrich Himmler, Hitler's second in command, came to visit the camp and he gave a big speech. He
exhorted all the prisoners to keep working for the success of the German Reich and that as long as
they kept working, nothing bad would ever happen to them.

My mother told me way in the distance while he was speaking she saw a spire of a small
Dutch church. She said it would be so wonderful if peace were to come at that moment and she could
run to that church and fall on her knees and thank God for being freed. It didn't matter to her whether it
was a church, a synagogue, or a mosque, just a place to thank God for being freed.

Of course, you know, Heinrich Himmler lied and three months later the concentration camp in
Vught was emptied of all prisoners and they were all sent to Auschwitz. And that's where my parents
were separated.
>> Edna Friedberg: You described your time in the Madna household to me as life through the mail
slot. Can you describe what you mean by that?
>> Al Munzer: Yes. As | said, | wasn't allowed out of the house at all. And the only view that | had of
the outside world was what | could see through a mail slot. There were some people who were really
neighbors of my parents who were very anxious to see how | was doing and they were not allowed into
the house either but they, too, could look into the house through the mail slot to see that | was around.
And that's really the limit of my outside view.
>> Edna Friedberg: For years.
>> Al Munzer: The first four years of my life.
>> Edna Friedberg: You said that not many of the Dutch neighbors knew you were there but many in
the Indonesian community did. Given that this was a period of time when Jews were being actively

hunted by Germans, what story did the Madna family come up with to explain the presence of a white
toddler in their Indonesian household had you been seen?
>> Al Munzer: They had three children who really looked very, very different but who did adopt me as
their little brother. Actually, there was a vote in the family to keep me there. That's something | found
out fairly recently. The plan initially was for me to be shipped to the family in some of the Dutch
farmlands where most Jewish children were hidden. But the Madna children were so fond of me they
wouldn't part with me. And that's how | ended up spending the years with them.
>> Edna Friedberg: At great risk to their family.
>> Al Munzer: Absolutely, a tremendous risk to the family.
>> Edna Friedberg: You've said by the winter of 1944, 1945, you're a little older, you have some
clearer memories, that that winter was particularly hard and bitter. Can you tell us a little about what
you recall?
>> Al Munzer: What | remember was being hungry. There was very, very little food in Holland during
that last winter. All | remember is one day seeing the table set for breakfast and | got up from my bed,
walked over to the table, hoping that | was about to be fed. | remember falling asleep with my head
falling on the plate and one of my foster sisters coming to get me there and finding me there. That's one
of those other memories of being with the Madna family.
>> Edna Friedberg: That winter a lot of the Dutch population survived by eating tulip bulbs.
>> Al Munzer: That's correct. Yes.

You asked me of the stories Papa Madna would come up with to explain my presence.
Because the house had been searched several times. He told some of the German soldiers that | was
the illegitimate child of his ex-wife and that she now had a new boyfriend who did not want me around
and that's why she had passed me on to him. That was one of the many stories he concocted.

I'm told that another time the family decided that it should be Mima answering the door.
Because she spoke no Dutch no German, there was total miscommunication between her and the
soldier who came to the door. So he gave up and just walked away.

Papa Madna was a man who was fabulous at making up stories. He could tell a story like the
one | told you just with a straight face and be very, very believable.
>> Edna Friedberg: We are running short on time but there are several more things to cover. Tell us
briefly wnat happened to your parents after they were incarcerated.
>> Al Munzer: Well, my mother -- both of my parents, as | said, ended up in Auschwitz. That's where
they were separated. My mother was sent on to work through slave labor in another electronics factory,
Telefunken, in a concentration camp called Reichenbach. My mother described witnessing that camp
being bombed by the allies and saying a prayer of thanks to God in Hebrew as she saw the factory
going up in flames.

But that was not the end of her ordeal because the Germans then evacuated all the prisoners
and moved them further west on what were called Death Marches. And many people did succumb. But
eventually my mother was freed at the Danish border.

My father's story was different. He remained in Auschwitz for about six months and then went
on to another concentration camp in Austria called Mauthausen, a real hell hole of a camp.

If you visit the exhibit upstairs, you will see an exhibit of these huge boulders that the
prisoners were forced to carry in that camp where they would very often be tripped. Many of them lost
their lives that way.

Then my father went on from Mauthausen to three more camps, Gusen, Styr, and finally a
camp called Ebensee. It was high in the Austrian alps, a beautiful soot where "The Sound of Music"
was actually filmed.

My father worked in abandoned salt mines assembling rockets, horrible, horrible work. He did
see liberation. He was liberated by the U.S. Army but he was so weakened that he passed away two
months later, still in Ebensee. He lies buried in the concentration camp of Ebensee.

And | visited his grave, which was an amazing experience. It's the first time, the only time,
when | fully came to grips with the loss of my father. | broke out in tears as | stood at his grave. An

incredible experience. Something similar happened when | visited Mauthausen. There was a
monument put up by the Dutch government. And there | found, totally to my surprise, my father's name.
Again, the same reaction. It really suddenly hit me that | had lost my father, that | never had a chance to
know my father.
>> Edna Friedberg: Just last year you learned additional details about your father through documents
in this building. Right?
>> Al Munzer: That's right. Yeah, every day still documents still appear. | came across a little slip of
paper of when my father was in Auschwitz. It his number as a prisoner. And then in German it said
"Premium Employee." No name, just a number. And then a signature, “Premium Employee.” So | asked
a researcher what that meant. And the researcher told me that it meant that the Germans -- the
factories had to pay the wages of the slave laborer they employed to the SS, to the Nazis. And it meant
that your father was considered a premium employee and they had to pay higher wages to the SS. Just
an amazing example of the tremendous bureaucracy that was set up basically to kill people.
>> Edna Friedberg: That story is just one example of what we are constantly, daily, discovering. It's
easy to think about the Holocaust as an exhaustively researched topic but every day we find new
things. We expect the size of our collection to double in the next 10 years, double. That's mindboggling,
a little intimidating to historians, but each of them is a story like your father.

Tell us about your mother's liberation.
>> Al Munzer: My mother was liberated through the intervention of a man who was the head of the
Swedish Red Cross. He had negotiated the freedom of several thousand women. My mother described
coming off of these cattle cars on to Danish soil and being greeted by the count. And she says she and
her fellow prisoners were so ashamed of their appearance but the count insisted on embracing every
single one of the prisoners as they came off the train.

And then she was sent to recuperate in Sweden. And she remained in Sweden for about three
months. And in August 1945 is when | was reunited with my mother. And that's the first really clear
memory that | have. | remember being asleep in one of the back rooms, my sister coming to wake me.
>> Edna Friedberg: Your foster sister.
>> Al Munzer: Right. | still call her my sister now. She's still alive. That's -- exactly. But she carried me
into the living room. | was cranky, crying. And the whole family was gathered in the living room, sitting
in a circle. She passed me from lap to lap like you do with a kid who is crying. And | remember that
there was one lap | wouldn't sit in, one woman | pushed away. And that was my own mother. Because
she was a total stranger to me. And | already had a mother and that was Mima Saina.

My mother realized that it would be very difficult to separate me from Mima and so her plan
was for Mima to continue to care for me while my mother went out looking for work. But sadly two
months later, October 1945, Mima had a cerebral hemorrhage and passed away. And so | have very,
very few memories, actually, of Mima, a few words of the Indonesian language which was my native
tongue. That's how she spoke to me. And | remember visiting her grave because Papa Madna took me
there so many times. But other than that | have really no direct memories of Mima at all.
>> Edna Friedberg: You did describe Mima singing lullabies to you. Can you tell us about one?
>> Al Munzer: One of the amazing experiences I've had through the Museum was about two years
ago. | was meeting up with a group of Indonesian students visiting the United States, a group of about
30 students. | told them the story, with photographs of Mima holding me, Mima in very traditional
Indonesian dressing. And then at the very end of the story, | said, you Know, Mima used to sing a
lullaby to me and it was called "Nina Bobo." And all 30 students started singing the lullaby in unison. An
amazing, amazingly moving experience for me.

And after that, young women with head scarves, traditional -- you know, Indonesia is now the
largest Muslim country in the world. These young women in head scarves coming up to me, hugging
me and kissing me and saying "We are all one family." An amazingly powerful message. It shows, you
know, that the message that we convey in the museum and my personal story has still a tremendous
impact.

>> Edna Friedberg: You now have gone to Indonesia. And the Museum does work in Bahasa, the
language of Indonesia, and Al is a close partner in that work.

I'll ask you two more things before we open it to the audience. Tell us about an incident at the
movies that happened to you and your mother when you and your mother were in Holland not long after
the war when you went to see a movie.
>> Al Munzer: We often think that, you know, the end of the Holocaust or the end of anti-Semitism.
>> Edna Friedberg: Of hatred of Jews.
>> Al Munzer: Yeah. But my mother and | were standing in line to go to a movie. This must have been
1946, sometime. There was a man standing behind us and he saw my mother's tattoo from Auschwitz.
And he said in Dutch, "There is one they didn't get." After that, of course, my mother always wore 3/4-
length sleeves. She did not want anyone to see the number that she had. It sadly shows that anti-
Semitism, hatred of Jews, did not end with the Holocaust. Neither did it end hatred at all.

The saddest part of the story of the Holocaust, as far as I'm concerned, is that it did not spell
an end tohatred. Hatred and genocide continue to this day.
>> Edna Friedberg: | think on that note we should open it for questions. We have runners with
microphones because we want to be sure that everyone can hear. Please raise your hand and | will get
a microphone to you.

First this woman and then this young man.
>> My English is not very good. | come from Germany. | would like to know where your father went --
why your mother immigrated to the United States. Was it anti-Semitism still, even now, active in all of
Europe? I'm sorry for this.
>> Edna Friedberg: Did people hear the question? I'll repeat.
>> Did you understand? I'm sorry. My English is not very good.
>> Edna Friedberg: Even for American accents | always repeat. The question is about why your father
first immigrated to The Netherlands and then why you and your mother left The Netherlands. Was it
because of anti-Semitism, discrimination against Jews?
>> Al Munzer: My father left his hometown, Kanczuga, basically for two reasons: one, a lot of anti-
Semitism, and the second in Poland there were very few opportunities so he decided to build a new life
in a country that had a much more liberal atmosphere and that was Holland. That's how he came to
Holland. And that's the same motivation that my mother had in coming to Berlin in the 1920s.

And the second?
>> Edna Friedberg: Why you left Holland. Came to the U.S.
>> Al Munzer: | think my mother just really wanted to get away from all of the memories of the Second
World War, of the Holocaust. After we came to the United States she never went back to Holland. She
traveled a lot, really tried to start life all over again and was very successful at that, | think. But there
were certain things that she did not want to go back to and one of them was going back to Holland. She
never did.

By the same token, my mother never had a strong anti-German feeling. She always -- she
impressed this on me, that we judge people as individuals and never as part of a group.
>> Edna Friedberg: Thank you.

Yes?
>> Thank you. You started to touch upon my question with the movie theater story. | Know there's no
brief answer to this but as briefly as you can, | was hoping you could elaborate a little further on life
after the war in between the time of August 1945 and when you emigrated to the United States.
>> Al Munzer: Very good question. | grew up with the Holocaust in those immediate Postwar years. So
| heard talk all around me of people who had not come back -- that's the expression that was used --
and others who did come back, like my mother. And somehow, you know, my sisters did not come
back. | didn't know what had happened to them. Aunt Jo, as | told you, used to tell stories about my
sisters and how wonderful they were. My mother told me stories like that. And as a child, 4-year-old, 5-
year-old, | was actually slightly jealous of my two sisters. | did not understand what had happened to
them. Many of my classmates had lost brothers and sisters. Many of them had lost both parents. So |

grew up really with the Holocaust and it took many years for me to really understand what that meant. |
guess | gained that knowledge very, very gradually. But | thought, you know, playing in a city that had
been reduced to rubble was the most normal thing. Playing on the beach, hiding in bunkers, | thought
that's what kids do. Sadly kids still do that in war zones today.
>> Edna Friedberg: Other questions?

Yes? The woman in green.

>> There were pictures that were shown of your sisters and your parents getting married. How did you
get those photographs after the war?
>> Al Munzer: How did | get the photographs after the war? Fortunately in Holland there were some
good people and there were people who kept many of my parents' possessions including a very prized
possession of boxes of photographs. | have gone through those photographs. | sat down with my
mother, went through the photographs. And that's how | have been able to tell the story of my family.
>> Edna Friedberg: It's our tradition here that our First Person guest has the last word. So, Al, is there
any closing thoughts you would like to share with us?
>> Al Munzer: | think the one message that I'd like to leave is that, yes, the story of the Holocaust
obviously is a horrible story. It's a terrible event. But what I'd like the message to leave you with is there
were people in this huge sea of terror, of horrible events, of hatred, there were a few people who were
willing to stand up and do the right thing, like the Madna family. | would hope -- this is the thing | leave
children with when | talk to classrooms. | said, you Know, whenever you hear people using the word
"hate," remember where that can lead, that that can lead to people ultimately being killed. Let's do
everything we possibly can to imitate the Madna family and stand up even in a sea of hate.
>> Edna Friedberg: Al, thank you very, very much.
>> [Applause]
