But again, 1-1n the morning, he would say his prayers with the tallis and the \u2014 oh, whatever. And so in one sense we were Jewi \u2014 because we were Jewish my father said that it was important for all of us to know ar \u2014 and understand who we were. And I remember my younger brother would go to chayder, I didn\u2019t go to chayder, I had a private tutor at home.

But my father had to report m-more precisely how many \u2014 how much grain wi \u2014 came in, or how much potatoes, that was important. And by the summer or spring of next year, my father, I remember him worrying that if we had too much land, would they think us being rich, and would we have to be shipped away? So I remember already him worrying what will happen if the Soviets would stay \u2014 would have stayed, because the imposition and the taxes or the contribution of grain to the Soviet Union was quite different than before, and he couldn\u2019t hire the \u2014 as many people as he did before.

I don\u2019t know what to be fearful, I couldn\u2019t tell you specifically, but it felt that the police was more on the Jewish side. As a matter of fact, one of my mother\u2019s brutha \u2014 brothers, which h-he is in the photograph, he served on the police force as a consultant for awhile. So, that never happened before. No Jew would ever s serve in government or a thing like that before the war.

But what happened, the Jewish community would get papers, a month or two months old, from Lvov or Krakow, or sometimes even from the United States, and that\u2019s how they sort of got their news.

So we already knew that he might not sur \u2014 I mean, we knew that we were all in major danger, so I think, now that you mention it, that was probably one of the reason that we moved from building number one to building number two, because This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Because every building had a bunker, and in building number one, the bunker was between the two houses, so it was a wall was walled off, and we\u2019d crawl into a s \u2014 into a small place to get into th \u2014 this wall. And in building number two, the one that we moved, the bunker was in the cellar. So when the killing began, everybody went into the \u2014 to the building, that was during the Purim massacre, and \u2014 and they didn\u2019t allow the baby to come in with us. He was, by then, four or five weeks old, he was still tiny. And you know \u2014 and I know he was tiny in \u2014 in the recollection of what he did, he was just lying there, he cou \u2014 you know, he couldn\u2019t even smile yet. So he was very tiny. And so we all went into \u2014 into the bunker in the cellar, and we couldn\u2019t bring the baby, so we left the baby on a big bed, surrounded with pillows. And my mom was crying and they kept holding her down. And we stayed there, I don\u2019t remember how long, but we stayed there til it was almost dark, you know, from the morning. And when we got upstairs we found the baby dead. But not just this, the baby\u2019s cries were so loud, that the baby jeopardized the people next door, who were hiding in that compartment in between the walls, between one wall and another. So here were the people, here were the two \u2014 you know, and the cry from this bed \u2014 from this room to the \u2014 the police, it \u2014 this was not \u2014 this massacre wasn\u2019t a German massacre, it was the Ukraine police and the German and the Poles that did it.

And then during Passover a month later, there was the big massacre, where they rounded up hundreds of people and they shot them in the Borschev massacre. And they lined them up and they shot all the people. I\u2014 I might be confusing a little bit because of such a long time, whether it was just at the Purim massacre, or the \u2014 or the \u2014 or \u2014 or the one just before Passover, where they lined up hundreds, everybody in Borschev and they shot them in the big grave. And again, this wasn\u2019t just a German \u2014 a German there with the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the Ukraine police with their shooting. And that grave, it\u2019s still there, but what I recollect, maybe that\u2019s a childhood memory, was that the grave itself was very long. It was about \u2014 longer than this house, which is this \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long. Well, anyways, it was almost a half a block long. And when I went to market pe \u2014 the \u2014 the peasants were talking about the grave, how it was bubbling and the \u2014 and the blood was just going up and down, bluh, bluh, bluh. So I went to the grave, and wanted to see it, to the Jewish cemetery and wanted to see the grave itself. And sure enough, it wasn\u2019t as strong as the first day, but still, you can see the heave of the grave, kind of, just the moving of the grave. And \u2014 and I let it be, and there \u2014 one of the Sturmers(ph) \u2014 the people, the wife of Mr. Sturmer(ph), her name was Chana(ph), she said to me, she says, I just want you to remember that I saw you in a blue coat, walking around, and I saw where you were coming from, which means This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, do you know, I always thought that that was just a memory kind of thing that I remembered kind of, and wouldn\u2019t say it til anybody til 50 60 years later, Chana(ph) Sturmer(ph) affirmed my memory. So, I don\u2019t mean I was happy, but it was like the memories were really memories, because I didn\u2019t talk much about the Holocaust or anything like that, 1t was just like 1t was unshared. It was something that I knew, and it was mine. And to have somebody say, I saw from where \u2014 you know, in this blue coat, and all of a sudden, I remember the blue coat, and it was unbelievable.
