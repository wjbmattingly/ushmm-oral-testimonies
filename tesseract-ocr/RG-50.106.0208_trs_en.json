The name comes back from steel and iron\ncompanies in Philadelphia. There was an Alan Wood Company and a Lukens Steel Company\nand about four generations ago, they kind of merged and a Lukens married a Wood and their first\nson Alan Wood was an officer in the Civil War. We have his uniform, as a matter of fact. And\nthen he was the first. The second Alan Wood Lukens was my uncle and he was killed in the first\nwar and I was named for him. He and my father and their other brother Lewis, all three went\nover in the first war together. They were all three Princeton graduates, two years apart from one\nanother. And as I say he was a captain killed in action, where they got the Silver Star. And then\nmy father and uncle were in different outfits, but -- and I was born in 1924.\n",

She was there. Her father was a very well-known architect, Frank Miles Day, the president of the American Institute of Architects who had built the whole campus at Colorado, enormous amount of construction at Princeton and Yale. And died in 1918. I never knew him but we have a letter from Woodrow Wilson to him, asking him to please design a house in Washington. He died in 1918 so of course I never knew him. But he\u2019s still quite famous. His picture\u2019s at the Octagon there at, where the architects are in the city."

But anyhow, I, as I say I was a ski enthusiast and I decided along with another group, a whole group of Ivy League skiers that we would volunteer for the Tenth Mountain Division. And so I arrived out there in March of 43, at Camp Hale, Colorado, a camp that was set up in the Colorado mountains. And an awful place as it turned out because it \u2014 the new barracks built and it was all depending on coal stoves. They had the railroad line ran right next door and that all depended on coal. And so half the people were sick most of the time. And then to shape up his whiz kids, called us, they brought in some tough army types from Hawaii who\u2019d never seen snow but to teach us the old army drill. We were still allowed to ski on weekends at the nearby place. But it was a very rugged training. And mountain climbing and rock climbing as well as skiing. And that went on for about eight months. And then somewhere along in there, there was a kind of an SAT quiz for one person to win and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 7 June 11, 2013 learn, go to a language school. And I won that and but I didn\u2019t realize that I had until suddenly some sergeant grabbed me and said get on the train. You\u2019re going east to learn Turkish. So I didn\u2019t go very far. And I met some other people in the same boat at the University of Nebraska where we had two weeks of great fun going to the football games. And after that we were transferred to Indiana. As soon as we got there, we learned that they had canceled all the language programs and that we would be engineers and that program \u2014"

That was supposed to fool the enemy by, same as they did in the first war, 80 division and so on. I don\u2019t think they were fooled but, so that was a lot of fun. I got to know the village. And in 1995 my wife and I went back to the village and I had written ahead. And it was a wonderful celebration and the lady who had, I had given cookies to was 12 years old, was now 62 and big matriarch of the village. It was a wonderful dinner with her husband and everything. The lady who ran the barn where we slept on the hay was still around. And the little and the when I was there the boulange, the baker whose first name was Allan, like mine, had grown up and taken the place of his father whom I\u2019d known. So all those people were there for this celebration in 95. On Easter day so it turned out.

            "answer": "I really don\u2019t. I\u2019ve got them somewhere and I have my, actually I kept a diary the whole time. But anyhow we went along pretty quickly and then the heavy fighting was about the beginning of April as we got closer to Munich. At that point we had gone so fast that instead of making us come back to stick with the third army, they then, we swapped with another division that had gone the other direction and ended up being in the seventh army, which was the one General Pabst that had come up through Marseille and all. So we ended up with that. And our big target was Munich. We were heading south. We were the only armored division there but there were two infantry divisions, the 42\u2122 and the 45\" that were near us. But and we had some, we were shot at by German 88s. We lost some people right along the line. Every night they had the famous bed check Charlie which was a German plane that would come over every night and drop some bombs. And there were some 88s, the big German cannon that were fired at us. What we had in our artillery was called an M7. It was a 105 tank mounted on a \u2014 or that was the bottom part was a 105 and then a 105 Howitzer on top of this German tank. It was a very unwieldly weapon. We had four together in a battery. I was the one that had to do the trigonometry and the sighting of where these four would aim. So we were most of the time, somewhat back in artillery. But not but then as things went fast, we many times we were find we were up right on the front lines and where prisoners were coming out. We took, I took some prisoners actually along the line. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 11 June 11, 2013 Anyhow this was all happening and we \u2014 toward the end of April. And as we got close to \u2014 we didn\u2019t know anything about Dachau at all. All we knew that was we were heading for Munich and we knew the big SS headquarters north of Munich which later became an American base was very heavily fortified. And it was really the SS headquarters in Bavaria, the whole area. So anyway, we were heading along quite well and \u2014"

And with the bombing going on or the shelling against us every night we had to dig foxholes and try to hide. Anyway, to come to that. We suddenly, we were on the right hand edge of Flike, of the 20 armored division. Most of the division was to our left or east, after the SS barracks. But all of a sudden we came to the camp of Dachau. We had no idea it was there. Neither did anybody up through colonel in our line of command. But the people in the camp of course were listening to BBC and they knew how close we were. So anyway, all of a sudden we come to this enormous camp, totally surprised all of us where we saw these watch towers and the whole camp was ringed by a moat and an armed barbed wire fence. So we got that close. We used our tanks to smash the barbed wire and to make across the moat. Just at that time there was one tall building which was where the German headquarters were and they had a white flag out and they thought, we thought that was fine. We\u2019d just go on in. But then despite the white flag, they had snipers and they started shooting at us and they actually killed our poor colonel. He was at that point his, I don\u2019t know his jeep had broken down or something. He was standing up on another jeep and I didn\u2019t know him well but of course that was a Shock for all of us. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 12 June 11, 2013 Later on in life, way much later, I got to know his son quite well who was a West Point colonel and who helped me when I, much later, when I was head of the 20\" armored division veterans and we had a reunion at West Point.

Reminded us of being in Colorado. The flat area and then suddenly seeing all of the snowy peaks. So some of us were allowed to go in, told we could but they didn\u2019t help us very much. So we just -- I got a ride I guess right to the entrance and at that point they wouldn\u2019t let us in, at some \u2014 https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 13 June 11, 2013 but then there was a Polish guy in our company, battery that spoke Polish to one of the survivors who opened the gates for us. And then we walked around. We counted 37 of these cattle cars full of dead bodies. They were, these were what the French used to call 40 and eight in the first war. They were made for 40, 40 men or eight horses. But actually they had something like 200 men in these. And the Germans had the \u2014 Nazis \u2014 the crazy idea that somehow if they moved all of the prisoners from other camps, that somehow they could congregate them there in Bavaria. And the world wouldn\u2019t know what had happened. And the other crazy idea was that they would have a, do a last ditch stand in, in Bavaria. So that was the reason for sending people on the trains. There were very, very few that made it. The ones that had gotten in that day were -- managed to get off. But there were only just a handful really that were still living on those trains. The ones that were lucky like a couple of my friends that I got to know later were sick enough so they were put into the infirmary and that\u2019s what saved them. Because the train didn\u2019t come all the way in. Those cars did finally, most of the, a lot of them stopped a couple of miles away. The trains were broken down or whatever. And then they got, they had to march in with dogs and they would sometimes often shoot the ones that couldn\u2019t make it. At least the dogs were snapping at them. So\u2014"

            "answer": "I think there were, there were two different things. It\u2019s hard to recollect what I thought but the first is the combat part, seeing, hiding from shells ourselves. Digging in foxholes every night. Seeing the wounded and seeing prisoners coming out. That was the nice part, seeing releasing prisoners. But so the whole war time part was kind of in a different mode from the, from Dachau. Dachau was a totally different thing cause we had no idea what, cause even though Buchenwald had been released, we didn\u2019t get the news of that. We didn\u2019t really know much about it. It had been in the Stars and Stripes. Eisenhower had very gallantly I thought forced the local people to fill in the graves and do that. And even though it was, I\u2019m not sure the dates of Buchenwald, early April I think. We didn\u2019t know about it. Stars and Stripes didn\u2019t get to us and they eventually of course did. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 14 June 11, 2013 But so we had the one thing was the whole combat part and the second was Dachau. So the few of us that were lucky to get \u2014 and not lucky, were fortunate I guess to get in there. We counted these awful 36 cars, rail cars and we were then taken down, toured them and there were I think 20 some barracks, each originally for 200. Each one had about 2000 in it. They have still they kept one there as a souvenir and smashed the others. Inside the camp when they knew we were close, the French particularly led a -- well what would have been a mutiny, headed by a French captain who later became a general and a friend of mine, he just died. He was the \u2014 General Dapeche, head of the, at that point he was a captain. And what they decided to have a kind of a mutiny, kill their guards, but then turn the camp over to us. And keep these distraught prisoners from killing every German in sight. So they did manage to do this, but at the end -- the German guards were all the worst. They were called kapos and these were German criminals who were told that in order to avoid jail or execution they would have to be guards at the camp. And they were really horrible people. And so at the end, we saw lots of their bodies. We didn\u2019t know where they had been killed by our troops who were just there the day before or whether they had been probably killed by the inmates. Anyway by the time we were there, we were led down and saw the crematorium where it had been decided to go ahead and, by the Polish prisoners doing it, were ordered to keep on using it because they had to do something with all the bodies from the train. And then the others who had died."

They had about 4000 Russian prisoners and they still celebrate it or celebrated that. And they were all told at one point to race down in the field. And if they got down to the other end, they would be free. And they were all shot in the back. But when we got there the m\u00e9lange of people, it was a little hard to make out. But mostly were Eastern European. And the ones in better shape though were the French, because most of the French had been in the French resistance and when we came into Normandy, what they tried to do was to turn over their respective villages to us. And many of them got caught doing it by the Gestapo. They were too eager. So they were then sent to Dachau. But because of that, they had only been there nine months compared to the longer periods of most of the others, and particularly the Eastern Europeans. And they were the ones that had sort of organized this sort of mutiny to turn the camp over to us."

            "answer": "Well I think we all had the same reaction pretty much. The curious thing, there were really very few from the 20\" armored. Just as we were invited into what they called combat command. And combat command B which we were in, only had our \u2014 we were the only artillery part of that. There was a very small part of our division and that was just by a fluke because the division was headed south and three quarters of it were after the SS and going straight to Munich. So it just happened that we were on the right flank. And then at the same time, after we had used our tanks to open up the barbed wire and all, then you had the, both the 42\u2122 and 45\" division that came in, in strong numbers. And that became a kind of a hassle later on because there were two colonels, one from each division that each thought that they got there first. And then Marguerite Higgins who was the first correspondent who came from the Tribune, and she rode in and I think it was the 45\" and they claimed to be the first there. And so did the 42\". We got very little credit for a long time. When I went back in 1940, 95, for the 50\", there were only three of us from the\" armored who sort of hooked on. My great, close Princeton roommate that I went back with who had been in the same outfit who has since died, he and I and one other guy that turned up, piggy backed on. The 42\" division really ran the reunion. There was a German American who lived in Munich who did all of the work so we found out about it and hooked on to them. So we got in to all of that, that way. But they were still arguing about who got there first and who did what. But I was able then, because I knew the ambassador and the counsel general, to get them to agree. They had no problem with this, that there would be a plaque for the 20\" armored as well as the other two that already had it. And that took a while to get through and eventually we put the big plaque up and I actually sort of inaugurated it when I went back in 2010, right at the gates where it says Arbeit Frei, the main gate.

We went to this crematortum and then we kept talking to the prisoners all the way and then we were taken up to the big building where the SS had had its headquarters. They were all gone. Maybe they had been shot or they mostly had fled. And that\u2019s where for example, I picked up that Nazi flag that the officer, and some other souvenirs like that. But anyway we weren\u2019t, I mean all this took about two hours of running around and then after that we had to leave. So that was our initial feeling about it, as much as you could have.

Oh yeah we were all shocked but then we went on and we thought there\u2019d be a big battle over in Munich. There really wasn\u2019t. It was declared an open city just before that so we drove right through it and it was very, mostly a smashed city but there wasn\u2019t any fighting to speak of there. And then we headed towards Salzburg. And we had some, a couple of big battles there. But then the Germans, several days before the war end, began to give up and then we had these tremendous lines of prisoners. Another guy and I were, we sort of fanned out as we went and we ended up taking a bunch of prisoners. And as we were heading between there and Salzburg, a couple of days before the war ended, we saw the, all of the Hitler Youth walking toward us from the village where the previous post was. And I\u2019m sure we passed his Feldhausen or something, his village, cause we saw these kids and we just made sure they were disarmed and just told them to keep walking. We didn\u2019t know what do with them. So anyway we drove down and about two days before the end of the war, we were told to stop briefly and no more firing. But keep taking prisoners. And we did and then so finally we arrived at Salzburg on May eighth. And it was a different, second armored division which were -- we were all clothed in American uniforms and everything else, except for the French thing on the shoulder, converged with us. And that was a lot of fun for me because I was able to speak and they had liberated a champagne factory and killed a lot of chickens. So we celebrated V-E day together in Salzburg. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 18 June 11, 2013"

They would do it and then some of these poor soldiers, it was quite clear probably later than then that they were sort of poor Hungarians who had been drafted in this and that kind of a third rate soldiers just thrown into the Wehrmacht at the end. So I don\u2019t think any of us thought much about it. We just kept taking prisoners and disarming them. Told them to keep walking, pretty much is what happened. Then a weird thing happened right after that. Our 20\" armored division was told to go after Tito. This was absolutely crazy because it meant driving over the Alps on a narrow road where over these tiny bridges where any one bridge could have stopped our whole progress. So we got all the way up kind of to the divide over Austria, from Austria to Italy, I guess it was, and were told to stop. So we were way up there. I remember climbing the highest mountain with some friends, the Dochstein and it was a kind of a little summer resort. So we sat there for about two weeks and had a great time and then we were told to come back down again so we came back down and were parked by the Chiemsee a wonderful lake between Munich and Salzburg which later became a kind of an American rest camp. So we hung around there for quite a while and that was fun. And then we were spread out to different villages in the occupation and that part we liked. We were here and there. I was sort of a local burgermeister for a while. We spread to different villages. Although I didn\u2019t know much German then. But that was interesting. And that\u2019s when Jack Benny and Ingrid Bergman came out on a USO show and I won a lottery to have dinner with Ingrid. Pll show you the picture later. That was fun."

All of that. It was an interesting period. It didn\u2019t last very long because through the month of June and in, well into July. And then we were told to get ready to come home to go to the invasion of Japan because we had had such a relatively easy time compared to other divisions. So finally we took a train ride across Germany and France. It took about a week to Camp Lucky Strike which was near Le Havre where they \u2014 that was the embarkation point.

Wasn\u2019t very fancy. But that was very exciting. We had the whole breakup of the main Congo and then my friend, I had to communicate the request for American assistance which turned out to be UN. All of that took place that summer. And then right in the middle of that, this was all in July. In the middle of August, suddenly De Gaulle decided he would give independence to all of those countries. And so then I ended up being the US representative to four independences. One every 48 hours in charge of Central African Republic, Brazzaville, the Congo and Gabon. And there I remained in charge of those for a while until eventually an ambassador came for the four and State Department said you don\u2019t want to work under him. You\u2019ve been in charge. Why don\u2019t you pick one of the other places and be in charge. So I picked Bangui, the Central African Republic. I moved up there at the end of 1960, got the embassy going there in February, moved up from Brazzaville. And my mother came down and then left for the, for England on the tenth of May, 61 which is when the plane went down. Over Algeria."

And got married back in Greenwich in her house on the 29\" of December 62. Went right back to Paris on the France. And then we were there I guess not that long. Til that summer, when I had the chance to go to a good job in Morocco so then we went there. And we had two years there. Three children born \u2014 a boy and the two girls. And then back to Washington fairly briefly and then I ran African personnel and then suddenly a chance to go and be number two in Senegal. So we did that for three years. And 45 years later is when we went back when our son was there. I had three years as number two there. And then three years as number two in Nairobi. And then Kissinger mixed everybody up so I went back suddenly to personnel, did that for about a year. And they suddenly moved me into being in charge of Spain and Portugal. That was fascinating. It was \u2014 and Franco was dead, dying in Spain and the Portuguese revolution and had a big fight, not personally so much, with Kissinger but he tried to win the Portuguese revolution himself without any \u2014 and I ended up and my friend ambassador Carlucci saying that the way was -- the socialists were the hope of there, not the old line right wingers. Anyway to make a long story short , that annoyed Kissinger. That and other things and he decided that Portugal and Spain shouldn\u2019t be under France so he abruptly moved that section of the State Department under northern Europe. My boss the assistant secretary told me that one day and said I\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t got a job because it\u2019s been abolished but I need somebody good and to be number two in Copenhagen. So we did that for three years. And that was fun. And at the end of that again there was sort of a hiatus but then they said we need a good guy to be counsel general in Cape Town. So we had three fascinating years down there. Came back for two years when I was in charge of western Europe for intelligence and research. And at the end of that made me ambassador to Congo. Did that for three years until we retired in 87."

Until they decided that was, they didn\u2019t have money for that operation. It was stupid. They abandoned that and they started up again after the attacks in Nairobi. But then I did other stuff for the State Department. I did a lot of teaching classes. I did declassification. I got involved in other things here. I was head of the Explorers club.

I mean some people jump faster than I did. I don\u2019t know. You never can tell. At the same time I was offered a job in Morocco.

We got to be very good friends. I went to see him in Belgium twice. He wrote a very long paper in French about, sort of an autobiography. He wanted me to translate it. Well, I couldn\u2019t do that, but I said look, they can do that at the Holocaust Museum so I will give it to them. And I did. I took it over. I manufactured or helped him write a thank you note to him, did all that. And they https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 28 June 11, 2013 seemed to be happy to have it. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019Il ever use it again. But he was happy. And then one of the times I went after. Not only did I get a letter to him, from them but \u2014 and I went to one of these stores and picked up some medals. Whenever, at one time we had a ceremony and I handed him a couple of American medals. Made him happy. He has since died. I was on the phone with him a lot. But then to go back into some of the people I\u2019ve kept up with. I don\u2019t know how much time you want to talk about that. But it was basically when I went back in 95 that I heard some of the stories of the extraordinary stories of the prisoners. Gail Schwartz: This is a continuation of United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with AlanLukens. This is track number two and you were talking about how you have kept up with many of the people. AlanWood Lukens: Yeah and not only the Belgian I was just talking about, the great friend. But two others that\u2019ve I\u2019ve particularly met and one I\u2019ve been in very close touch with ever since. A Frenchman named Joaquin Cote was among a group of French resistance youths in a mountain town about half an hour away from Geneva, an Alpine village called Hagrepoche. In Christmas of 1943, there was a small castle there and 35 of these young people mostly men but some girls, decided they could have a Christmas party. The Germans were too far away and that they would be safe on Christmas day in this small castle. So they had a party. Unfortunately one of \u2014 there was a Vichy-ite there who heard about this and informed the Germans. They came up all drunk in the middle of the party. They killed all but five people, burned the chateau. Five people played dead but they were arrested the next day. One of them was Joaquin Cote. They were sent from camp to camp. A horrible situation all the way through. Four of them died along the way. Only Joaquin Cote made it. I met him in 1995. And because of that became great friends. I went back in the 2000s, in 2005 and in 2009 I guess it was or somewhat. Suzy and I went over to their village and he had died, but the son has been a very close friend ever since. They stayed with us in Washington and we went over there, went to several services, made speeches and laid wreaths and so on. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 29 June 11, 2013 We\u2019re going to see him this year. He and his wife are close friends. That was one story. He kept saying well I was the one that saved his father. Well I didn\u2019t because he, obviously, was one of the many survivors. Through him there two or three other veterans from that village that I\u2019ve seen. They\u2019ve given me their stories and so on. Another curious story from another friend. He was on a train in Germany being hauled as prisoners on their way to Dachau. The train got stuck in a little valley between two tunnels. They were all French on board. They were afraid that they would be attacked by allied planes who were bombing German troop trains. And the tore up their clothes and put it on top of the freight car, red white and blue tricolor to help the allies spot them. And then finally one of these guys that I met in Tskuri, he and a Polish friend walked back along the tracks about two miles to, through the Germans to the Americans, where the Americans were. They got a bulldozer to go down the tracks, open it up and pull this one car back to the American camps where they were all of course welcomed and eventually brought back."

A wonderful man and he was down to 70 pounds or something. Now he lives in southern France. But his story was really unbelievable that every day the Germans, the Nazi guards would count the number of bodies or the number of people standing and thereby decide how much food would be rationed. And so many were dying each night that they would carry the bodies out, stand them up so that there would be a larger ration. He told us that story. It was really extraordinary. I keep up with him.

But and I learned a little bit of German here and there. And then but one interesting thing I hadn\u2019t mentioned but I will quickly. At that first one in 95, I sat next to a German general at a big dinner the night before. He was the head of the medical department. And that was quite a dinner that I did get into or some of us did. Anyway he asked if I would talk to his medical students men and women, about what happened. I said yes, of course I would. So I by that time, the next day or something we went to Salzburg for a little thing. I took the train back. And a day or two later a German colonel that made the hotel which still struck me as odd, took me out and had lunch at the German headquarters with about 25 officers and they brought up, that was kind of bizarre. They found a kid of my age, then age, 21. A private in the German army, kind of made him sit there to see what it was like. That was a little bizarre. But they were all very nice and they were all, some had been also in NATO fans. We had given a big award to this German general, his medical thing. So at the lunch he invited me to go into this auditorium where there were about a hundred medical students, boys and girls in their 20s I guess. And he said that they had almost all spoke English. Well I don\u2019t know. I spoke in English obviously and fairly slowly and I told them all about my experience. And got a standing ovation at the end. I don\u2019t know how much they got out of it but it was fascinating to do that. On the way back from this last time on Lufthansa, I sat next to a German general of all things. And he was very nice. After all, as you\u2019ve said you get used to the fact that they are our allies and that and I made a point in my speech everywhere for and there that, particularly that we were all, this would never happen again. And that it\u2019s there somewhere, anyhow. We\u2019re all allies and that we would all together believe in the slogan of never again. And I complimented him on the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 34 June 11, 2013 fact that at all of these events, they brought in all kinds of German high school and college kids. And I\u2019d say most of the crowd there in 2010 were Germans. Well maybe half German and half survivors. It was hard to tell, a couple of thousand people there. But now they have a wonderful ladies, German ladies that run the new welcome center. And they were the ones that I dealt with beforehand and got on the program. And they were very worried. It was funny. Ahead of time, that the initial rivalry between the three divisions would make it odd. I represented all American troops unless I get a clearance from the other divisions. So I did. I knew the guys in each one. I called up and said look I\u2019m going to be back there. And I just speaking for the 20\". I happen to be -- all of us who were there in 45. Do you mind? Oh no, no that\u2019s fine. You can represent us. They were -- track them down. One from each division somewhere in this country. And but it\u2019s funny that the German organizers were afraid that somehow this would come up, that if I spoke \u2014 anyway we cleared all that. But so I think enough time has gone by so that anybody that was there at all and still living -- cause an awful lot have died. But I certainly got into this because at the end I became president of the retirees of the 20\" armored division. I did that for about five years. I organized several of our reunions and the biggest one was at West Point, just before this, actually the same year, 2010. And that\u2019s \u2014 they had one more we didn\u2019t get to and now they\u2019re going to \u2014 they wanted to go back and have a final one at Camp Hamilton Kentucky. I\u2019m not sure I want to go back there."

It was kind of curious. But and I didn\u2019t, I criticized the other people, maybe as a contrast that I had such a fascinating career afterwards. To some of them, this was not the Dachau but the fact of being in the 20\", and in the war was probably the \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to sound disparaging but the biggest thing in their lives. They went back to their small places where they lived and brought up and that was fine. That wasn\u2019t true of all of them. There was one guy in Tucson when we had our thing there, that he had done a lot of speaking and he had \u2014 he just died. He was a very good man and we went, at our reunion there. He rallied around and found all of the survivors and a number of Holocaust who were Jewish refugees and people so that was very interesting. So it didn\u2019t apply to everybody but I would say to some that it was that Dachau was not, except for those of us who saw it, was not the main \u2014"
