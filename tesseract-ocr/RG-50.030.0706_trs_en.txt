Q: So —so I will start —
A: You go ahead.
Q: — asking some questions.
A: Go ahead.
Q: And we’ll go from there.
A: Go ahead.
Q: And I’II start at the very beginning. Could you tell us where you were born, when
you were born, and if your name was different at birth?
A: Yes. I was born on August 8, 1921, which is now 91 years ago, and my Czech
name was Pekarek.
Q: Pekarek.
A: P-e-k-a-r-e-k, Pekarek.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: That was my father’s name, actually it was my name. And should I continue?

Interview with Frank Hyde ,
May 4, 2013
Q: Yeah, what was his name, first name?
A: His name was h-u-g-o, Hugo Pekarek. And the whole family was Pekarek, I
can show you some pictures of a cousin of mine, Pekarek. And we changed it only
after the war.
Q: Okay. When you were born, wh-what town were you born in, or what place were
you born?
A: Capital of Czechoslovakia, which was Prague. I was born in Prague, I was
raised in Prague, until the situation has changed.
Q: Can you tell me what part of Prague, what section of Prague?
A: I was born in the old section of Prague, which was very similar to what we call
in New York, the east — Lower East Side of New York. The bil — remember —
Q: Yeah.
A: — that was 1929 when I was born. So the buildings were usually four flights up.
The more modern building at that time, had an elevator. Not the building I was born
at. You had to walk the four flights, and we were living on the top floor. Why we
were living on that top floor? Because when my mother married my father, her
mother was living in that apartment, and in those days people were living together,
SO we were born in that apartment where my, actually grandmother, was already
living.

Q: So tell m—
A: And that was on the fourth floor.
Q: Do you remember the address?
A: Sure.
Q: What is it?
A: I have to say the way it sounds in Czech.
Q: Sure.
A: The number was 11, and the street was called Bilkova. That’s b like in boy, i-I-k-
o-v-a, Bilkova Ulice. Ulice is street.
Q: And was it in the center of town then?
A: Very much so, yes. In —
Q: Was it —
A: — the old section of Prague.
Q: Was it near the cemetery, the old Jewish cemetery?
A: There was a Jewish cath — I would call it cathedral. There was a Jewish section
very close, yes, on the next street, so to speak, we had to go sa — Jewish holidays
[indecipherable] we used to walk with my father, I remember very well, to the
temple. So the temple was, you would say like, you go s — the main street, which
was called after Paris, the town in France. So the street was Paris —

Q: How do you say it in Czech?
A: — of course in Czech it sounded different than when I say it in English. But the
name was still the town, Paris.
Q: What was the Czech version? How did you say it in — what was the street name?
A: Pariz, Pazheesh(ph) — Paris, in English —
Q: Pazheeshka(ph).
A: —1s Pariz in Czech.
Q: Okay, so it’s Pazheeshka(ph).
A: Pazheeshka(ph) Ulice, yes.
Q: Pazheeska(ph) Ulice.
A: And when you cross that street, that was that old section, which was the Jewish
section. We had a Jewish temple, Jewish synagogue and very small cemetery,
because it was in town. So the cemetery was not bigger than this room where we sit.
But that’s where, usually, the Jewish people congregated on holidays. I don’t see
where it’s actually Jewish, or religious, no, but there were holy days where my
father, whether he wanted to show his son, or whatever, so we went to the temple,
and spent some time in the temple. When I was 13, I was — I had Bar Mitzvah. But
then, because of the circumstances, you know, which unch — fa — unfortunately

started, you are not so proud to be Jewish. That was — you know, it was always a
handicap, so to speak, in my life.
Q: Even in Czechoslovakia, before Hitler came?
A: No, before Hitler came, everything was normal, nobody cared whether you are
Jewish or Catholic or [indecipherable]. The only question — we used to play soccer,
because soccer was the sport in Europe, so the question was only, what position did
you play? Nobody ask about religion, or where you came from, or — was — was not
the subject to talk about. You were Czech, the Czech name, and you were Czech as
everybody else, and look, that was not an issue, and — as much as I remember —
Q: Okay.
A: — it was not an issue when you were growing up, no.
Q: And — in your life, it wasn’t.
A: I-In my life —
Q: Yeah.
A: — yes —
Q: That’s right.
A: — I’m talking about my life, yes.
Q: Okay.
A: Very gradually, you know, the situation has changed. May I continue?

May 4, 2013
Q: No. Because I’m going to ask questions. I want to, in the beginning of the
interview, I want to establish — I want to establish the world you were born into, so I
ask about the people that you knew. And we’ve talked a little bit about your father, I
want to know more about him, I want to know about your mother, any other
siblings. So if you will allow, I will ask questions about —
A: Well, I tell you — tell you, well, I had a sister, was three years older.
Q: What was her name?
A: Mi-Mariva(ph). We were calling her Mimi, m-i-m-i.
Q: Mimi, mm-hm.
A: There was a brother who I have never met, he passed away of some kind of a
child disease. My parents — my mother was born in 1892. My father, 1878, about 14
years apart. But in those days, people were at home. You know, my mother was
always at home, cooking.
Q: What was her name?
A: I—i-d-a, Ida.
Q: Ida. And her maiden name?
A: Naturally in Czech, that was her name.
Q: Yeah.

May 4, 2013
A: And you know, the very — I remember my mother, you know, she was always
cooking. The main dish was lunch, not like in the United States. The distances were
different, so people were eating lunch at home. And in the evening was always
something which they either warmed up, or something special, you know, some
sausage or something, which was the thing which people ate in Prague at that time.
My father was — he was representing a factory which produced sweaters, cardigans
and stuff like that. Prague, of Czechoslovakia is a reasonably cold setting. If you
wanted t-to really get warm, so to speak, you had to — not fly, there was no planes —
you had to travel down to Etherlis(ph), through Austria, and that’s where the warm
weather really was — existed. But coming back to my family, so my father came
home, usually in the evening. We had dinner — I mean, what we had for dinner, he
had for dinner, and everything was normal. It was a very normal life. My mother —
now it might sound strange here, because everything is pre-cooked, and pre-packed
and stuff like that, but you know, when my — I remember there was a bed in the
kitchen, and I was a very sick child somehow, so I was very much staying in that
bed during daytime. And I remember my mother when she was making pasta. Well,
the pasta had to be made from scratch, you know, it was eggs, and whatever she put
in, I don’t remember, but it was on a plate, and she was cutting it, you know.
Q: And how did you — what did you call it, in Czech?

A: The pasta?
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Ah, now it escapes, the word. How would you call pasta? It will come back to
me.
Q: Okay. Did —
A: It was — somehow I, lately that I want to say something, and I miss the word, and
then it comes back, you know?
Q: Yeah.
A: But that’s how she was making the pasta, which goes — which went into the soup.
Q: Yeah.
A: And that’s how I remember my mother. Then — then —
Q: And now it’s a delicacy.
A: Oh, sure. That was how it —
Q: Homemade food 1s a delicacy.
A: The grocery store was downstairs, but to buy pasta in a grocery — nu-nudle.
Couldn’t think of what it was, but you know, it’s something you didn’t hear for —
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: I’m out of Czechoslovakia since 1948.
Q: Yeah.

A: So we talking about 52, plus 13, 65 years. So what — to remember, all of a
sudden, a word which you have not heard for —
Q: So many years.
A: — 60 odd years, is very difficult to remember, you know?
Q: Yeah.
A: But this how it was, and I remember my mother, after lunch, with everything had
to be spotless, and cleaned, and God forbid something was on the floor, had to be
polished, you know, and was a —
Q: Did she have any help at home’?
A: Sorry?
Q: Did she have any help at home, or did she do this all herself?
A: She was the — by herself. It was nonexistent. In the afternoon, we were kids, like
I said, so in the afternoon we went to a certain spot on the mountain. There was a
mountain nearby. The boys played soccer, of course. I don’t remember what my
sister was doing, whether she was there too, or whether sh-she was [indecipherable]
Q: Would you mean — by mountain, do you mean like a hilly area? Would you tal —
be talking about VySehrad?
A: Well, yes, it was not really a very hilly area, but there was — yes.
Q: Is this VySehrad?

Q: Letna.
A: — ]-e-t-n-a, Letna.
Q: Okay.
A: Na(ph) Letna.
Q: Okay.
A: And there was a grocery shop, you know, and that’s where the women gathered,
they were talking whatever they were talking about, I don’t know, but we were
talking about soccer, you know, playing soccer.
Q: Of course.
A: Then they went home, evening, and you had the dinner at home. That was
summertime. Wintertime, well wintertime, you went somewhere to skate. Now in
those days we didn’t have an ice skating stadium. But tha — because it was a cold
country, the tennis courts is where you s — that were — you know, they just put water
on it, that froze because of the cold weather, and then during the day you went to

skate on a tennis court. Now, it was not tennis court for us, we were ca-calling it ice
skating rink, you know.
Q: Of course, of course.
A: But this — that’s how life used to be.
Q: Your — your parents, I’d like to know a little bit about their personalities. What
kind — was your father outgoing, an extrovert, an introvert?
A: No, I think he was — I remember the place where he used to go, what they used to
call coffee shop, and I remember at that time, that coffee shop in — when he took me
to see, or whatever, it was so terrible full of smoke, because in those days people
were smoking, irrespective of health, or whatever, they were smoking. So when I
went with my father to that room, the thing what impressed me most, my memory,
was the terrible smoke. And you know, he said, you speak to his people who were
playing cards with him, and stuff like that. Then, most likely my mother picked me
up, and we went wherever we went.
Q: Did —
A: You know, he was not a com — extra — he was a regular father, 1n my opinion.
Unfortunately, what happened later, naturally wi— no, I shouldn’t say split. The
circumstances split us. You know, because I got married very young. Can I dwell on
this subject with you?

Q: We’ll come to that. We’|l come to that. Your — are — were you closer to one
parent or the other?
A: Well, I think as a boy I was closer to my mother, yes.
Q: Okay.
A: I remember very distinctly as a boy, we used to go shopping. The Macys was
called [speaks Czech] I don’t know if you heard it from some other person.
Q: I’ve lived in Prague.
A: Oh, you did live in Prague?
Q: Yeah.
A: Well, then you know what I’m talking about [speaks Czech]
Q: [Speaks Czech]
A: From [Czech] were like somehow a small street, and there was a butcher store.
But he wasn’t selling raw meat, it was more like a salami type of a place, you know.
And I remember with my mother I stopped there, with her of course, and we bought
pork, which was spesh — the Czech — one of the main dishes in Prague was pork. I
mean, pork was not like here, you know, pork — people don’t eat pork. And I don’t
eat it now either. My f— every day I fish. But, you know, that changed over the time.
But back — at those — at that time, when I was maybe 13, 15, I remember that I went
with my mother, whatever she was doing, on that [speaks Czech] I don’t remember,

but we went in — down south, and there was that butcher store where we stopped by,
and had some bite of whatever, and go to [indecipherable] back home.
Q: So you a— so you would —
A: So she was closer to me than my father.
Q: Your father. But if you ate pork, that means that your parents didn’t observe the
dietary — the pa — your parents didn’t observe the dietary laws —
A: Not at all, no, no, no.
Q: Okay.
A: We were born Jewish, yes, but it was not like that we had a Jewish household,
no. It was a regular household.
Q: Okay.
A: No — nobody asked these questions, that’s how everybody was living. But you
came to the bil — call it building, house, on a— on a regular day, especially Saturday,
the house was like a — smelled like a restaurant, because everybody was cooking the
same thing. We were doing the same thing like our neighbors, whether they were
Jewish, or Christians, or what — that was not the subject, nobody cared about this.
Q: Did —
A: I’m talking about when I was a small boy —

A: —I don’t know how it developed later on.
Q: Of course, of course. Well, Czechoslovakia was a new country at the time.
A: Yes, it was originally 1918.
Q: And was there a great feeling of patriotism because it was fine — was there a great
feeling of patriotism because it was fi —
A: Oh, definitely.
Q: — because it was a new country?
A: Definitely. Not only that, but our constitution was identical to the US.
constitution, because the U — you know, the United States president at that time,
Wilson, was very instrumental of carving out Czechoslovakia. You would have to
know more about the history, but Europe was occu — no, I shouldn’t say occupied,
say ruled by the Austrian-Hungarian empire.
Q: Yes.
A: And that was the House of the Hapsburgs, king of Hapsburgs, or whatever he
was, emperor, I don’t remember that part. And everything — the language was much
more German, because the Czechs were part of that Austrian empire. But then one
of the — one of the principle politicians over there at the time, Masarek(ph), he
petitioned — came here, and he petitioned Wilson, and I don’t know who came after

him, or before him, to es — to give the Czechs the [indecipherable] determination
right.
Q: Yeah.
A: So they calfed(ph) out of that Austrian empire afterward, during World War I,
Czechoslovakia. There was no Czechoslovakia before. There was — the state was
called Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. Those were three states which were, so to
speak, the bone of Czechoslovakia. So when, apparently here, or there, when they
realize it’s too small to be independent, somehow they attached Slovakia to it. And
that’s why it became Czechoslovakia. The original three states —
Q: I see.
A: — and then another two or three states to the — I say to the — to the —
Q: To the east a little bit.
A: — to the right — to — to east, so to speak.
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: So, the very eastern part of Czechoslovakia was very close to Russia, and that’s
why it was so, later on, during World War I], Czechoslovakia — Czechoslovakia
was ceded to the Russian sphere of influence.
Q: We’ll come to those things. We’ll come to those things.
A: Well, that’s the truth.

A: That — schools?
Q: You — your school life. What kind of —
A: Well, the —
Q: — school did you go to?
A: — school — I went to a German school, because at — wi — you know,
Czechoslovakia, that time there was no Czechoslovakia, so when Czechoslovakia
was founded, just like here, you had a better chance to get a position when you
speak Spanish, and certainly English. So there, my mother, I remember her saying
all the time, whatever you want to do in life, you have to talk Czech, which was our
language —
Q: Right.
A: — but you have learn German. So, I went to a German school.
Q: Did you speak — at home —
A: Yes?
Q: — I just want to establish, you spoke Czech with your —
A: Ch — oh, sure.
Q: Okay. Did your parents know Yiddish at all?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Frank Hyde "
May 4, 2013
A: Not at all. The first time I heard Yiddish, you would not believe it, when I was
going to Auschwitz. I never heard of Yiddish. There was Czech, or German. Now,
if you didn’t speak well German, maybe you had some kind of a mishmash of
German, but not Yiddish. I have — my friends they was all Czechs, I mean, who
spoke anything else but Czech?
Q: Your — did you know anything of your family history, beyond your father and
mother and maybe grandparents?
A: Yes, th-this — somehow — my father used to say that his family came from — that
would be west — from the southwest of Bohemia. And he was — he thought that his
ancestor were Catholics, but there were — you know, there was all kinds of reforms
going on under — not Martin Luther King here —
Q: I know.
A: — but the original Luther.
Q: Right.
A: And there was also somebody in — in Prague by the name of Jan Hus, h-u-s.
Q: Yes.
A: So there was a certain split in the — in the religion.
Q: And certainly within Catholicism.
A: That’s correct.

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Frank Hyde
May 4, 2013
Q: In the Middle Ages.
A: And — and he thinks that instead of choosing the sides between the two split
Czech — Catholic religion, that they chose the Jewish religion. This why our name is
not Jewish, you know, our name — the Jewish, let’s say, names in Prague, they were
the Feldmans, like my wife’s single name, or the Schwarzkopf(ph), just like here.
Q: They were like more Germanic names.
A: Exactly. Now look, here somebody is called Schwarzkopf(ph), you know he is
somehow Jewish.
Q: Or German.
A: Or German.
Q: That’s right.
A: Well, that was exactly in Prague. So to know somebody by the name of Pekarek
and be Jewish, that didn’t exist. And I will tell you a small story when I was a kid,
and I went to the German school, not speaking German. But I remember that my
teacher, that was the first grade, second grade, you know, I was what, six, seven
years old. Somehow she is — there was some question about religion, and she assign
me to the class, or to the time to have religious schooling, to the Catholic class,
because of the Czech name. Well, I didn’t speak any German, but somehow I
objected to it, and I said that I was Jewish. Th — so she sent me to the Jewish class,

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Frank Hyde ot
May 4, 2013
or whatever, but I remember the name, that was not a Jewish name at all. Now, this
— we were Jewish. This — we were born as Jewish people, but then, unfortunately
what happened — I told you I was not a very proud Jew, no, because everything what
happened was because of the Jewish faith. And lots of things happened, ma-maybe
we come to it.
Q: Yes, we come to —
A: But so —
Q: I guess —
A: The name I change for different reason. If you want me to tell it to you now, Pll
tell it to you now.
Q: Yes, let’s do — let’s — let’s do it — let — tell —
A: Well, we were — my name was Pekarek.
Q: Pekarek.
A: I married Georgine, she was Pekarek, of course. And then what happened 1 — th-
that was 1947 — ’°48, the infl — at that time, the influence of Soviet Russia was
tremendous. Why? Because that goes to polit — politics. The Czechs always felt that
the west let them down. Th-The — the che — the — the west means England, not the
United States, the United States was out of this world. But England, France,
partially Italy, that instead of helping the Czechs, so to speak, maintain their

Interview with Frank Hyde oe
May 4, 2013
identity, freedom, they let them down, and then in turn, Hitler marched in, and the
whole situation has changed. So the Russia influence was very strong. We,
Georgine and me, we didn’t care for it, because we have seen what happened when
you don’t have freedom. We both survived Auschwitz, we came back in 1945, and
were living in Prague as best as we could have done it, until ’47 - ’48. But when the
situation became very, very difficult, we didn’t like it. We thought again, we might
have to go through the same thing. Maybe not the extremes, but hardly the freedom
which we were hoping for. Well, we decided to get out of Czechoslovakia, which
was 19 four — late ’47, early ’48. I couldn’t get out, because I was, quote, military
age. So I thought that if I somehow split with Georgine, that by myself I will be
easier to get out than two of us with luggage and all and that stuff. That’s how we
thought of it. Well, I met somebody by the name of Hyde. His name was Walter E.
Hyde. Through him, I got a English passport. So Georgine left Prague in February
1948. I couldn’t get out that quickly. In the meantime she went from Prague to
London, stayed in London for a while. From her mother’s side, they were here,
surviving the situation in Ecuador. Now, of the f — all these countries, I’ Il tell you
why Ecuador. That was Georgine’s uncle from her mother’s side; he was a dentist.
But he didn’t care for dentistry, he was more like a businessman sitting on the board
of directors here, sitting on the board of directors there. And somehow he became

http://collections.ushmm.org

Interview with Frank Hyde oS
May 4, 2013
consul general of Ecuador. Well, how he got Ecuador, I can’t tell you. But that’s
how it was. So it was — unfortunately, the situation became worse, before Hitler and
all that stuff. He was trying to convince Georgine’s mother and father to go to
Ecuador because he was able to give them the visa to go to Ecuador. Well, my
mother, you know, they were in a different situation. They had a house like a house,
and those days there were no mortgages in Prague. So to leave your house, to leave
your business, that was unheard of. Why should I go to Ecuador to listen to those
idiots down there, or something? This is my home. Well, unfortunately, it didn’t
work out in the long run, but since they survived in Ecuador, in Quito, they came
after the war here, like most of people usually do. So when Georgine was in
England, she heard, of course, of her aunt and uncle, that they were here — they
were in Ecuador at that time. But they know they were living in — in Ecuador.
They came here and that uncle of hers had some earlier connections to somebody
who was a manufacturing person. And because of the Cold War which existed
already at that time, somehow the United States government was pumping much
more money into Puerto Rico, as a prevention that Puerto Rico wouldn’t go too
much left, like some of the countries did.
Q: Right.

A: So he was — he was offered to build a factory in Puerto Rico. So since that uncle,
who was a dentist representative of Ecuador, he told him, well, if you just came
from Ecuador, you speak Spanish, you want to manage my factory
[indecipherable] from Prague. So they settled to Puerto Rico for some time. So
Georgine, not having any other family, from England, went to the United States,
went to Puerto Rico.
Q: Rico.
A: So we stayed, of course, I was in Prague. Not divorced, that was not the question
[indecipherable]. But I managed to get out of Prague. By myself it was easier than
together with Georgine. So, when I got out of Prague, naturally I had nowhere to
go. But the train took me to Paris. Well, I have to say something in favor of the
French, irrespective of their view today, of that view. The French, at that time, were
extremely helpful. They tried to reunite families who were split, you didn’t know
where — last time saw him here, last time you saw him there. So it was very difficult,
but the French were helping. And they were helping also, the people like myself,
who all of a sudden, from Prague, was in Paris. We were called DPs, displaced
people. And I got to Paris couple days before July 14", I’m sure you know what
July 14" is. Well at that time, of course, that time was the different. That was 1948,
and de Gaulle was still around, and he was running down Champs Elysees, I

http://collections.ushmm.org

remember like today. When I did go to France, to Paris, I was supposed to see
somebody who somebody knew somebody in Prague, and I was supposed to see
those people. So those people took me to that celebration of July 14". Now,
spreading out this story which I’m just telling you, my sister — or rather, my mother
had a sister, who had married a Viennese person, all Jewish, but she didn’t like the
situation as it was. And, before Hitler came in, she decided, with the husband, to go
to, at that time Palestine. There was no Israel. You had to take the boat, which was

was there. So when she came back to Prague looking for her family, but there was
no family except us, my sister, me. But she didn’t like it because she said exactly
what we have found out later on. That it’s too autocratic, too left-wingish, and she
thought there was no future for Czechoslovakia to survive again. So somehow she

Australia. Now, my sister, you know, she was very much into languages. So, for her
to speak English, French, Italian, although she was born in Prague, she spoke all
these languages. So, she was — for her to go to Australia was no problem, she spoke
English. So they went to Australia. Well, the trip to Australia by boat, that’s a long
distance, this is not around the corner. So when they arrived in Australia, I was in

Hyde provided you with the — and you chose Hyde as your name, or did you change
your name when you were in Australia?
A: No, I changed my name only after we got the passport in the [indecipherable] if

A: A depression, that’s correct. So, he promised jobs, and he promi — he didn’t say
how, but what he did, you have t — again, I’m talking about history, after World War
I, the French and German were not always friends.
Q: Okay, excuse me, I’m going to interrupt. What I am interested to know is, did
Hitler have an influence before he marched in the country, before he marched into
Czechoslovakia, and took it over, when you say things changed gradually, was it
such that it — internal life in Czechoslovakia changed for the Jews, even before
Hitler came? That’s what my question is.

A: — border. That was occupied by German minorities. But since the constitution
was like here, everybody was alike, and there was no ant — anti-German feeling, or
anything like that. But, let’s go back to that recession which we had. So, when that
was all the world was the depression, and Hitler promised jobs. Now, how did he
deliver the job? Because, like I started to say, after World War I, the League of
Nation, which was the forerunner of the United Nations, they thought Germany, not
Hitler, there was Hindenburg, which was the president.

stop him, maybe they didn’t have the power to stop him.
Q: Yeah.
A: He has grown. So there was no — no anti-Semitism in Prague, or anything of that
nation. Everybody was Czech, and on the contrary, if you didn’t speak well Czech,
you were — somehow you — you were not liked, if I can say that word. And in that
connection, I would also like to tell you, into my house where I was living,
somebody moved in from Poland, ab — what used to call 1s — a Polish Jew. His name
was Ehrlstein(ph). Well, the name tells you already, German Jew, so — he became a
leader of the Jewish population at that time, because somebody has to represent the
Jews —

Prague longer than other people who were already deported, in camp number one.

A: Not until 1937 - 1938.
Q: Okay.
A: It was the same.
Q: All right, what happened in 1937?
A: Well, the Czechs were forced to give up some of these border countries. So there
was a resentment against the rest, because officially Russia was — officially. They
were not doing much, but officially they were. So, the negotiations were primarily

people were pushing — well, at that time they were negotiating with Prime Minister
Chamberlain. Now, naturally, in those days, when you gave your word, you were
supposed to keep your word. So Hitler, through Chamberlain, through
Ribbentroph(ph), and Italian Charnow(ph), Hitler promised the dema — the
demand on the Czechs to give up those border countries, is his last territorial
demand. Chamberlain believed it, because in those days, when you signed
something, you were believing. So he went back to - Chamberlain went back to
London, where he came from, and showed a piece of paper, and this piece of paper
is a guarantee of peace in our lifetime. Well, he didn’t realize whom he was deali —

now all the European continent really turned pro-German. The Austrians, they want
to be German. They were German speaking people, but they were so different from
actually Germany, that it was not — you know, th-thinking about, he promised jobs,

A: Anti-Semitism to a certain extent, because they were always connected, the
Jewish were looked at — German speaking people, rather than Czech speaking
people. The names were German. So it started to deteriorate. To what extent? Not
that much, but then started the transportations.
Q: Well, how did — my question is much more personal than that. It is, when did
your life, your father’s life, your mother’s life, how did things happen in the family?
Hitler marches in, and by what point —
A: Well, it’s changed primarily because young Czech pe — young Jewish people, th

married. The single Jewish people, they were — well, they were taught to meet
somewhere, and that’s was something what I always call like Madison Square
Garden. We don’t have Madison Square Garden in Prague —

you s — you saw the changes which gradually occurred. At home I don’t think I have
seen so many changes. Maybe I didn’t pay attention to it. I was a young man, they
still u— before Hitler came, you know, we still went to dance. And there was a
resentment, but there was still freedom enough to go and enjoy — don’t forget, I was
what, 18 years. So what did 18 years do here? The same thing they do over there.
We went to dance. I remember the place where we used to go. It was called coffee
shop, but not the type of a coffee shop what we call here a coffee shop. It was much

dancing. But that gradually has changed, because —
Q: Did your father lose his job?
A: Sorry?
Q: Did your father lose his job?
A: No, I don’t think he lost the job at that point. I think he retired, he was forced to
retire. So he was home, my mother was always home. I don’t know how they were
making a living, I was — but I remember the first salary which I got when I was
working for that Jewish firm, naturally my obligation was to bring it home. That was
understood. It was never thought by me tha — or by the parents, that somehow I
would take it and spend it somewhere. We were — that was ex — you know, that was
anticipated and expected from you. Life was very different in those days. But it has
changed, you know. I lost that job because ultimately he found out that I was Jewish,

or whatever, and it was [indecipherable] how could I have worked with somebody
with a swastika, and all this stuff. Soon it became —
Q: What was his manner, though? Excuse me —
A: — it became worse.
Q: Okay. The manner of that person who ended up taking over the firm, with the
swast — did he — was his manner arrogant, was he —
A: No, no — well, that was his mentality. But you know, th-the — the life has
changed, what has changed? The laws have changed. So th — we were playing that
soccer. Everybody realize there was no restriction, no nothing. But gradually the
non-Jewish population was put on such pressure, not to socialize with Jews —
Q: Yeah.
A: — that all of a sudden your friends, were afraid to be your friends. So, the
relationship has ceased. Everything became a separate society. The Jewish people
were — we had to wear Jewish stars, we had to be home at eight o’clock. So there
were certain restrictions which were put on the Jewish population, which became,
you know, like what they call here [indecipherable] it didn’t happen overnight, but
it was, you know. The first thing, for example, that I remember, as a kid I used to
play the violin. Well, don’t ask me what day, what year, but all of a sudden we were
supposed to submit all those musical instruments to a certain place. Well, but it’s not

that I didn’t agree, you — you were afraid not to agree. So you did what you were
doing, because the Catholic population, they could not help you, because they were
afraid themselves. So, the — the — the hostilities, or the violence, increased. So that
there was a distinct difference between the Jewish population, and the non-Jewish
population. And the very first transport, as I remember, a cousin of mine, he was
much older than I was, but that’s not the issue, the only reason I’m saying it,
because with his wife, somehow they had no children. She — she lost a child and she
couldn’t have more children, or whatever, they were one of the first ones to be
deported to a Polish ghetto which was called Lédz, l-o-d-z, is a town in Poland.
They survived there until a certain time, when that was also liquidated, and he
wound up in Auschwitz. Lost his leg in Auschwitz and everything else, but they
came back after the war, and — because so few people survived, I was reasonably
close to them at one point, you know. Remember, the age was different, he was born
1900, and I was born 1921, so it’s 20 years different. So when we came back, I was
only 22, 24, he was already close to 50.

older, you know. Now, what the Jewish people did, or at least our group did, there
was somebody who — the father had the wholesale business, and the wholesale
business was in a building which he owned, in the old section of Prague, not far
from where I was growing up. And they used to go to that house to dance. But

was to delay the deportation, because you knew where you were, but you did not
know what will come once you go. So you did anything to delay the deportation. So
if you — 1f you look at the calendar, you will remember that in 1941, when we got
married, Pearl Harbor happened.
Q: That’s right.
A: So we thought, oh my gosh, now the United States will go to war with the — it
will be over before we go.
Q: Yeah.
A: So everything was done to delay that thing. Now, since you were married all of a
sudden, whether it was this girlfriend, or this — or vice versa, from the girl’s point of
view, we got married. Now, of course, the circumstances were very, very different
already. Number one, we had to wear a Jewish star. Transportation, there was hardly
any in place. Now the streetcars, which we had at that — remember, we talk about
1939 - 1940, so different now, no doubt. But at the time we had streetcars. And the
streetcars, the entrance was in the middle. So there was a front part, and a rear part.
So the Jewish people had naturally to be in the rear part.
Q: Of course.
A: So when we got married, well, we had to go to the rear part, to — I don’t know

Jewish person. And they were living in a certain place, I can’t remember the street
any more, but I remember where it was.

you didn’t work, you didn’t get your stamps, which you needed to buy food, so we

You were told what to do. Now, you have to realize that some of these Jewish
people, including her father, mother, when they were deported, they left behind this,
let’s say. So that had to be emptied, because the landlord wanted to rent it. so he
couldn’t rent it when all the stuff was there. So I was assigned to a unit which was

apartment and they were stored in a large synagogue in a suburb of Prague. I was in
that unit which was doing this —
Q: Work.
A: — work. Now, since we had pictures from the Jewish family — at that time, if you
remember, maybe you don’t remember, because your age, west Europe was already
under the attack by British, maybe American planes. So some of these planes hit
German households. So the German government gave these burned-out families,
something what we have here, what we call food stamps. Now, they were not having
food stamps, but they had stamps to buy certain things, to reestablish them in
Prague, or wherever they were living. Now, let’s shall — talk about Prague, because
that’s where I was active. So when they came, and they had these stamps, coupons,
or whatever it was, that they could buy two paintings. Now, naturally they didn’t
pay for it, they gave you that stamps in return. But there was no gallery, like here in
a gallery, you know, you — that was a pile of paintings, that it was segregated
between certain items of paintings; animals, or flowers, or whatever. They — in
German they call it stil leben.
Q: Stil leben, yeah.

A: So, I remember that when these people came in, they wanted to have a stil leben
for their dining room, so I had to hold it, because they wanted to look at it. So when
I was holding it, you know, that’s how you hold stil — why do I mention it? So when
we got married, in October 1941, and I was still working for that Jewish
organization, assembling the sewing machine, pictures, and all that stuff. So when
we had to report to, quote, Madison Square Garden, there was naturally an SS guy
who directed the — the people, the traffic where you had to check in, where you had
to go. Somehow he remembered that he was buying — buying a painting that — which
I was holding. So, h-he called me out from the deportation, and he said, you stay
here. So naturally then — remember, I spoke perfectly German, I had German
schools, and then you —
Q: Right.
A: — improve it, because everything was German. So I was telling him that I have
also a wife here. So somehow we found where Georgine was, and the delay, again,
everything was always delay, delay, delay.
Q: What about your parents? Were they —
A: My parents, they sta — that was a difference, I —

Week, or something, whatever. You talk about my parents. My sister worked for the
Jewish government, the government which was connected to the German
government. Don’t forget, the Germans didn’t do any orders, they gave the orders to
the Jewish government. So there was a Jewish police, there was a Jewish this —
everything — not everything, of course, but within certain — so my sister was working
for that Jewish organization, call it the Jewish government. And that was primarily
because, if you remember I told you, that person who came into our house where we
were living. So he knew my mother, he knew my sister —
Q: This Edelstein(ph)?
A: Edelstein(ph). So he was delaying their deportation. So they stayed
[indecipherable] in Prague much longer than I and Georgine, or her parents.
Q: Got it.
A: How long [indecipherable] how long, but you know, eventually they also came
to Theresienstadt, just like my sister. But sh — my sister, from the job in Prague,
she had the same job in Theresienstadt, because —

people they killed. I tell you they knew exactly how they killed. They had system,
and if you read back, you know, the papers what I have here — I will have to look for
it to show it to you, tru — they knew my transportation number when I was, well,
with Georgine, when we left Prague for Theresienstadt, the — the transport had a
name, the transport had a number. We had a number. I don’t remember the number,
of course, but I have papers here to show you. So, my parents were actually deported
later.
Q: Okay.
A: They — they perished, of course, just like everybody perished. But they — later th
— they lived a little longer, let’s say, before they got into Auschwitz, and Auschwitz
was, of course, the end of it. Because you, when you were in Auschwitz, and you
came with a train, and in front of you stood that doctor, whatever his name was. And
he decided as you go this way, or that way. Natch — now, you have to realize, I like
to tell you, we know now when we say the word Auschwitz, we know what it 1s.
But you have to go back to 1941, when we got married, ’42. So when we were living

horrible. But it was a paradise compared to what happened. Why do I say it?
Because, you know Theresienstadt is an old town, named after Queen
Theresienstadt, or whatever she was [indecipherable]
Q: Theresa, mm-hm.
A: And naturally, those were barracks for the Czech armed forces. Now there wasn’t
that much space, nor that many beds or anything. So they constructed bunks, three
on top of each other. So that was a terrible shortage of space. When you went to the
bathroom, you had to have your container for soap, you went there, you know. It
was not a bathroom in a sense, like you go here. So, it was very difficult. The
crowds. You had to wait in line to get your food, you know. So when you come
from a normal atmosphere like here — and I don’t mean my house per se —
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: — and then all of a sudden you have a regimented life, you have to be there seven
o’clock, or nine o’clock, or whatever. And then you slept three on top of each other,
which one are you going to go? On top, in the middle, or down below? So there
were arguments among people, Jewish people, but don’t forget, they were not only
Jewish people there —
Q: Of course.

A: — there are also Jewish people from some other places, because it was supposed
to be a model ghetto, and hit — and Hitler was running the border over. So it became
extremely crowded. Now, in that Theresienstadt, the first x months, I can’t tell you
how many months, but I was assigned to distribute coal, because I was working in
the coal firm, so I was assigned to a coal job. What was the job? Well, all these
people who were living in these places, they were assigned boxes, with the two
handles here, two handles over there, and that you had to fill this — this up with coal,
and they took it in wherever they were staying. The houses were condr — houses —
th-they were n-not houses like —
Q: Barracks.
A: — you know, when — shacks. But that was converted so that some people could
have — like there is mostly men, or mostly women, and they needed heat, so they
were getting the coal. So, at one point, the — you know, when — when the coal
normally was sold, or delivered, there used to be a little hut with a scale outside. So,
because of my coal co-connections, I was given the use of that thing. So Georgine
moved back in with me, in that —
Q: Hut.
A: — hut, they call it. In the — in the public [indecipherable]

Q: Okay.
A: But s-slice.
Q: Slice, okay.
A: Slice this, you know, then that — that they — look, we used to go to play cards
with that friend of mine, who was, of course, Catholic. He was my — playing soccer,
I was the right wing, he was playing next to me, whatever we used to call it. So we
were friends. So we used to go to — they were living very close to where I was
living, when we talk about park.
Q: Yeah.
A: So, in the evening, whatever during the day, he was working, I was working. So
during the evening, we went to see, in his home, such an old house, I remember like
today. And we were playing cards, you know, killing the evening. There was no
television, of course, you know, in those days. So we played cards. The mother
divorced — his mother. And me — and wa — she was dating somebody who was
German. But he was very — you know, not every German was a Nazi at that point.

A: But, they deteriorated. Then it came that we could not stay longer than eight
o’clock, we had to be home. So we had to go from his house to my house, to go
home, because you didn’t like to take a chance if somebody would catch you on the
street. So it gradually became worse and worse and worse, you know? And then, all
of a sudden, you couldn’t see him any more, because he was afraid if he was — if
somebody will see him with a Jew —
Q: He gets into trouble.
A: — that he will have a problem.
Q: Yeah.
A: But talking about the German language and all that, Auschwitz, you know, when
I was comparing it to that here, 9/11, when we had that World Trade Center
coming down, I know where I was, I’m sure you know where you were.
Q: Yeah.
A: And I saw the first plane hitting the thing. Well, at that time my assumption was
that the guy lost his bearing, or something happened to the plane, and he hit the
building. So the same was with Auschwitz, you know, when you — when you don’t
know, and you are confronted with these unknown things, what happened? So,
coming back to Theresienstadt, they got there in March ’43. And from March °43

Q: Right.
A: — or anything in between, men. So, we were assembled, and we had to — we had
to go to these open boxcars, which were full of coal that had to be taken out, the
coal, and we had to go in. Then they took off March — September 28, eastward.
Now, we knew that the American allied soldiers were coming westward, but they
didn’t get far enough for us to get out, whatever. So when the train was full of
people, open boxcars, well, you know what people do, you know. People have to go
to the bathroom, there is no food. I have to interject here something, because my
friend out on Long Island, he always says, well, what about food? And I always tell
him, Fernando, there were no dining cars, you know. But there’s something else. So
after we were traveling east — northeast, there was somebody, as I remember it like
today, in a stripe — remember, Theresienstadt, we had our clothes. So that was also,
you know, where you put it, and all that stuff. So there was always a shortage of
space, and you intermingled stuff, and it wa — it was really a source of trouble. But
when we were traveling east, there was a guy in str-striped uniform. And we get out
of those boxcars, where are you from? Because we wanted to know what camp is he

something.
Q: Yeah.
A: Didn’t mean a thing. Well, we continued traveling for I don’t know how many
days. And finally we got in to something which we — was called Auschwitz. But
you know, again, the Germans, what they did, they tried to intimidate you right from
the first moment you entered this whole area. The train didn’t s-stop, yes, but not
that everybody had to get out of the train. It took, I think, two days before they
finally set everybody out of those boxcars, and get out. And the train was going
around, around, and you had no idea, because there were no signs. You didn’t know
how — where — how come that we go around. Nobody was there to tell you anything,
of course. So finally when we came to a stop, which was like, I would say, the
couple of days after, October first, second, I don’t know for sure. Well, we to get
out, you know, orders in German. And my — we were together, her father, the two
uncles, the two doctors, and also some other relatives from her mother’s side.

A: So, well, we had to get out, and then you were confronted by that top German
guy who was — welcoming you, whatever. And he — my father-in-law, he was saying
that he’s a — he was not old, but in his mind, he was old. He was only 50 years, fif —
exactly 50 years, but you know, he lost his house, he lost his business, and
everything else. So he felt he’s old. So he was telling him in German that he’s an old
man. So he had to go this way. Well, the two brothers, the doctors, me and someone,
this way. Well, once you are split, you try to find out what happened to the people
who are the other way.
Q: The other place.
A: Well, they to — they told you here is gas chambers, crematoriums, and the only
way out of here is through the chimney, you know. So, if you find out what
happened to him, and well, then we were in Auschwitz. First the shoes had to be
disinfected, so they put it into water. Well, this was intimidation, you know? So now
you had shoes wet, icy cold. Auschwitz is in a very cold area of southern Poland,
standing in those freezing temperatures, wet shoes, no coats, no nothing. They give
you pants, but those pants are like, you know, his pants were, if he — I don’t mean

forces horses. Don’t forget the time is still horses. So, if you had to have equipment,
horses had to pull it, not a car. Gasoline was very difficult. So the — the — the — the
stables they had, seven floors, of course. And they were contructions(ph) for the
horses, but contructions(ph). The size was just about like the table. Not high, I
don’t mean that, the s — the size. And that was on the floor, and the edges were a
little higher. So think of it as on the floor, but the end was a little higher.
Q: Okay.
A: Why was the end higher? Because the people had to put o-oats into that
contraption, so the oats were not all over.
Q: Right.
A: Then the horses ate the oats, or whatever else they were eating. Now for us, the
height was good because we put our head on it. There were no beds, like at
Theresienstadt we had bed — we had beds, we had bunks, but that was still —

Q: Yeah.
A: Naturally. So he was — he came up with this story that if they do nothing, they
will not survive, because the cold weather, the food, no food, nothing. So he said
that the best will be for us to say that we are locksmiths. And I always say that’s the
only lie I lied in my life, because I said I’m a locksmith. So we s — but he figured
that if we say we would be locksmiths, that they would send us into some kind of a
factory, and it would be inside, rather than somewhere outside, digging roads, or
something.
Q: Right, right.
A: Well, he was right. They were always — they were always counting how many are
alive, and all that stuff, in Auschwitz.

A: Of — of course, old people, we used, of course [indecipherable]. Of course, the
old people were dying, but they were buried.
Q: I see.
A: Sure. And I think they started with Auschwitz from Theresienstadt, because I
think really the Germans were concerned that maybe some disease, or some uprising
might happen, you know, over the multitude of people, you know, and now, of
course, they had th — they had the weapons, we had nothing, of course.
Q: Yeah.
A: But they would have to shoot.
Q: Yeah.
A: All that blood, and all that mess which would probably happen. So they started
with the deportation out of Theresienstadt, you know? I think that was the main
reason, apart from getting rid of the Jewish population.

one. Of course, she came back to Prague, where I was, you know, first thing

they told you will be transported someplace, so the tr — they call the names. Now,
lots of people changed their names, not legally. Why? Because they were afraid in
case they would be punished or beaten up, or whatever. They might have
ramification to the family somewhere else.

stayed behind, unfortunately, and because I stayed behind, you always have to do
something what they told you to do. So for maybe about a month, or six weeks or so,
I had to — I was assigned to a group which was taking out the dead bodies from the
gas chambers, which had to be taken to the crematorium. You didn’t like to leave
dead bodies in the gas chambers, you had to go to the crematorium and burn them.
And then, you know, th-the ashes was nothing. So the — the transportation took place
on a—I don’t know how you would call it, it had two Vs on each side, and a piece of
wood was like this, you know? We were not so strong, I can’t tell you how many we
had to push always to get to the gas chambers. Take the bodies out, put them on that
stretcher [indecipherable] and transport them to the crematorium. Well, that went
on for some time, I would say maybe about a couple of — maybe about a month or
SO.

A: But instead of sleeping, we had to empty a tray of briquettes. You know what
briquettes are? Briquettes are about this big. So we had to empty that tray from the
briquettes. Well, then — then that [indecipherable] the tables, and they threw the
briquettes, they chased us in. So again, you know, you are in a train, like my friend
always, what about food, what about food? First of all, we were already dehydrated,
the body was stopped, like you sitting here —
Q: Right.
A: — or I’m sitting here. I don’t know how many pounds we had, but food was not
really the item which bothered you, so to speak. So then she starts back into the

train, and the train took off east, just like from Theresienstadt east, this time from
Meuselwitz, Germany, east. Away from those upcoming American soldiers.
Q: One point here, I just want to establish. So, if I understand properly, you were in
Auschwitz for about two months or so?
A: No, I was there longer than that. I got to — in Auschwitz in September 28, so we
got there like, I would say, October first.
Q: Right.
A: And out of Auschwitz, somewhere around Christmastime.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: So I would say about three months.
Q: Three months. Three months.
A: And then from Christmas to the quote, liberation where I’m trying to tell you —

A: —1n Meuselwitz.
Q: In Meuselwitz, okay.
A: Now the Meuselwitz didn’t have any accommodation, like I just said —

interested in producing it. Anyway, so when the order came to get inside those
boxcars east — but you have to realize, that was not Germany of the 1940s, that was
Germany of a defeated country. The railroads were ripped up from the bombing of
the United States. So the transportation wasn’t like that you hop in here and you
wind up there, no. It was very difficult. Not for u— I mean, we were just prisoners,
and we had to do whatever we were told, but it was not so easy for them either. So
we were traveling for two days, eastward. Then we came to a place in Germany, or
maybe western Poland, or something. Next to us was a train with German soldiers.
They were heading west, we were heading east. It’s like that, okay. I was like this,
they were on this side. So my particular boxcar, we were told to get out of the
boxcar so that they could count how we are still in the boxcar are living, because
some people are die out of hydration, age, malnutrition, sickness. So they always
counting. So while we were standing alongside our railroad car, next to us was a
German car, right? I mean, the British bombers came by, and they started to dive,
and started to shoot. Now, you know when you are up there and you starting to
shoot, you don’t shoot like this, you shoot like this, you know? So that you kill as
many opponents you can kill. So there was a panic at that moment. We were out of
the car. So, we — wi — wi [indecipherable] if you want to call it free. That’s not the
right word, but no supervision at that moment. So that was a hill, and I always call it

the same like here. You know, you have a hill behind you, and you had to run up the
hill, because you wanted to get away from the shooting. So we were — remember, I
was — 1945, I was what, 24 years. So, you had the different stamina to run than you
would have now that I’m 91. So we were running up. When I say we, there was
always somebody who was closer to you. I remember one guy, his name, but I don’t
remember the other two who were running, Czechs, with us.
Q: Right.
A: So we got up on top of the hill. Now we were realizing that we didn’t have any
German guard watching us, right? We were free. Free, without any passport, without
any papers, striped uniform. So free is a different thing for free. And that — and the
train, which I told you, the British bombers started to bomb. Eventually they hit the
train. So there was a tremendous commotion. But we wound up on the top of the
hill. So that — what are we going to do? Are we going to stay here, get organized, or
going back, or whatever. So we decided four of us, cold as it was, that we will stay
overnight, and then we will think what we do the nec — next day. So we decided one
day to stay up on the hill, and maybe two nights, I don’t remember for sure any
more. But we decided to go back, because we thought, we had no papers, we had
nothing. Where are we going to go? Not that we had anywhere to go down there, but
at least we were not fugitives from —

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Frank Hyde .
May 4, 2013
Q: Right.
A: — where we were. So we went down the hill, and as we were coming down the
hill, believe it or not, our train took off. So we — we really lost the train. The
prisoners who were still there. We took only about one car, which was where we
were. The rest was still inside. So, we left the train — so we, when we saw the train
moving, we ducked a little, to be sure that they don’t start shooting. And they left,
and we went back to the hill. So we were on that hill [indecipherable] Fernando
will buy the food. I said, oh Fernando, there was no food, there was no service,
that’s for sure. But anyhow, we went back to the hill, and we stayed there another
two days.
Q: No food, nothing, yeah?
A: Thinking where to go, how to go, what excuse.
Q: Yeah.
A: You know, the roads were all occupied by what we have here, National Guard, or
what do we call it here?
Q: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
A: So we knew once we get down, that we will be confronted. The only thing, we
spoke very well German, and we came up with a story that we will say we were

Czech workers on the train, apart from prisoners from Auschwitz. So, we were
different. We thought we are different from —
Q: Those.
A: — and that our papers, in that commotion, we lost our stuff which we had, and that
would have shown that we are Czech workers. So finally we decided we take a
chance, we have to do it, because we don’t live indefinitely on top of the hill. So we
went down, a short enough distance, like you would say, maybe further down,
maybe [indecipherable]. Sure enough, there was a station, this we — soldiers with —
three, four soldiers with guns. So we put our hands up right away, that they don’t
start shooting. That’s the approach, then w-we told them exactly what I’m telling
you, that we were Czech workers, on work in Germany, in that factory where we
were, and that our clothes was damaged in that attack, and that’s what we saved, is
what we have on. Well, you have — you have to put you into jail, you have to see the
magistrate the next day. So we were now in — in a regular jail. Well, if you have a
brain injury — and I hope not [indecipherable] but it was the first time a regular jail.
There was discarded clothes. So, what we did, we took, instead of our prison
clothes, we took the discarded clothes which was left there by whoever. So when
this local magistrate, the next morning, we had ill-fitted clothes, but it was not —
Q: Striped.

May 4, 2013
A: — striped. The story was that we are Czech workers, that we were — of course, we
spoke German, that we were caught on the train, which was bombed by the British
and we got — you know, we were trying to get somewhere, out of, you know, where
we were. Now, the most unexpected thing happen. The magistrate said that, you
suffered enough, You are free to go wherever you want to go.
Q: So he didn’t believe your story?
A: Well — well, he let us go. So we were free. So then, coming back to Prague, how
do you get back?
Q: Well, did you then have a paper, or a stamp, or something.
A: No, we had nothing.
Q: So you could have been stopped the next town over?
A: Yes, well, we were not stopped, you know, the situation was like here after 9/11.
You know, it was not — it was not so rigid any more, you know.
Q: It was chaotic.
A: I-It was halted, you know.
Q: Yeah.
A: Now, I would like to also tell you at this point that the cars which existed, which
were allowed to travel, didn’t use gasoline. What they did — the Germans are very
inventive. The — the cars which were allowed to take what I am telling you, they had

to cut out the passenger seat. The driver, was a driver, but the passenger seat was
taken out, and they put in something like you would say, a contraption, with wooden
chips. And the wooden chips had to be put on fire, and they produce a little bit of
steam, and the steam produce the car to go. So when we tried to get to Prague hi —
not hijacking, ja — jack — how you call it here, when you —
Q: Hitchhiking.
A: — hitchhi — hitchhiking. So we tried to get to Prague hitchhiking, because we
have, of course, no money, no paper, no nothing, four of us. So, a truck, which was
something I remember like today, like a pickup truck, he stopped. Where do you
want to go? Of course we said Prague, and he said he goes to Prague, too, but his
truck — where we were was a very hilly country. So he said, most likely the truck
will not make it, you will have to get out, and have to push the thing to get over the
Q: Hill.
A: So we took seven days to get back to Prague, because he had only that thing on
the side, producing the — the s — the steam. But we got to Prague April 20", Hitler’s
birthday, and they were still celebrating. That’s it.

A: Well, her sister was in the place where we thought we will meet. So since we
didn’t eat anything since that in — you know that in — that left, April seventh, April
20, 13 days.
Q: You hadn't eat anything for 13 days?
A: Who should have given me some? So she gave us — I remember like today, tea.
Well, I said [indecipherable] something else. And shower, bathroom, because we
had lice. If you know what lice does, you know, they crawl all over you. So,
naturally she was afraid that we bring the lice into her home. So first was the
bathroom, you know, staying there because how many hours, to kill the lice. And
then a cup of tea. But you couldn’t get out of that house, because we didn’t have any
papers, so we were afraid if you get — we — I was afraid, if you get out, you know,
that somebody could stop us. And then what? Don’t forget the hair — th-the hair, you
know. But during the camp, they shore it, so people knew that you are from
somewhere else. So we stayed inside until May five. And quote famous Czech
revolution started May five. Ended May nine, was horrible. Because people take
vendettas, you know. Because you did this to my family, I did this to you, you
know. Was very, very, very, very bad, very bad.

A: People, you know, people found out where the Germans were hiding, and they
killed them, of course. But if they would have killed them with one shot, is one
thing, but that was not the case, it was awful. Those are the unfortunate results of
war, you know? The people who depress people, you know, that comes out. But
then, April — May nine, it stopped. The nation came back to order. There was police,
real police, you know. So gradually things get to order, and I — and I have to again
say the French, they were having all kinds of ways to reunite families. Don’t forget,
you didn’t know where —
Q: They came to Prague’?
A: — Georgine, didn’t know where she was, of course not. But they had s — like we
have here — not here, in New York City —

A: — stands where you could have both newspapers. So those places, they hung up
signs that you’re looking for somebody last seen in this camp, in September, or
something, you know, that he should report to this and this address, and stuff like
that. So it took a little while to get it back into order. But those who survived, well,
they had some arrangements, you know, like I told you about these two doctors.
They all were supposed to meet in her sister’s house, and they did, one at a time.

Q: There are more questions, but —
A: Somehow — I don’t know how I got the apartment, whether it was given to me,
whether I could occupy it without a lease, or whatever, I don’t remember. I had an
apartment the old section of Prague, new building. No elevator, but it was on the
second floor. I don’t remember whether I — I don’t know how I maintained it, I
didn’t have any money. But eventually I got the job, you know, the one — the one

years since you’re out of there, you know.
Q: Of course. So, was it in a residential neighborhood, or was it a city

A: No, that was a residential neighborhood, yes.
Q: A city neighborhood, or —
A: Yeah, it was very nice, and again, you know, when — when these deportations

Nobody ever thought that you will not come back.
Q: Come back.
A: So yes, you — you will come back, and you should have someplace where you
will quote, meet.
Q: And Vlasta(ph), was she able to stay there because she was married to a non-
Jew?
A: She was married to a non-Jew, but that actually it was a surprise that she
somehow managed not to be involved, because that was not an excuse. She was
Jewish, so under normal circumstances of that time, she would have had the same

Czech. She married somebody by the name of Krejcik(ph).
Q: Krejcik(ph).
A: Now Krejeik(ph) is like a small tailor, in English. So the name was, of course,
Czech, and she was married to him for quite a while. Well, they would have been ol-
older than we, but I remember him, and she came here couple of times, we have a

no problem with that part, no. And specially the bathroom. Now, you know, these
are human, so when you go to the bathroom, you know what happen. You have to
clean yourself, and —
Q: Right.
A: — wash up yourself. There’s something which didn’t exist in Australia — ah, in
Australia, in — in — in Auschwitz. There were no bathrooms, you know, there was a
piece of wood, and you had to sit down and do what you did, and there was no
water. So you really — you personal esteem, or hygiene, or whatever you want to call
it, was absolutely nonexistent, you know. Just think of it, what she was talking
about, that underwear. Well you, when you are in that kind of a cold weather, and
you are not properly dressed, your nose is running con-constantly. So, at one time
they were, probably as a make you feel miserable, or whatever, out of that prayer
shawl, they made shorts. So — which I started to tell you earlier. Somehow, when

time, to Colgate University, undergraduate school, and we used to get — get up there

What did you know of him?
A: Well, of course I remember the name, H-Heydrich, of course. Well, one
experience comes right to your mind. When he was killed, and they were looking
around for those parti-partisans, they used to call them, who they suspected killed
him, well, we were living in an apartment — we were married, of course, and we
were living in an apartment which was assigned to us, because the parents had to
move out of the house where they were — lived. And they were assigned to another
Jewish family, which was, as soon as you remember Prague a little bit, near the
Charles bridge.
Q: Bridge.
A: So we were living in that neighborhood, and I do — I don’t know what I was
doing, but most likely working for the Jewish organization — I shouldn’t call it that
way, but that’s the way it was.

A: And I remember we were, of course, sleeping, and all of a sudden somebody
burst into that room — I don’t know if they were soldiers, or SS soldiers, that I don’t
remember, but they were moving the furniture, which was not ours, which was, we
had the furnished room. They were looking for some hidden escape routes which
these partisans might have taken. That was the middle of the night, whether it was
10 - 12, that I don’t remember, but I remember very well when they came.
Naturally, we were scared to death in bed, sleeping and all of a sudden somebody is
there with weapons, and go — moving the furniture to see whether it’s a hidden
staircase to go somewhere where that person might have been hiding.
Q: Right.
A: But ultimately, of course, they didn’t — didn’t find anything, they left. But it was
very difficult. The — the conditions became worse. I don’t mean living conditions
like eating, no. It was more the freedom of moving around, yes. Because you were
supposed to have the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing it, without
having the documents which a non-Jew had to produce, you — it was punishable.
And the office which I was working at, was just across from the headquarter of the
Gestapo. So we had the — I have seen many things which normally people would not
have seen, you know, that —
Q: Such as?

A: Well, the trucks with the prisoners, and the mistreating of prisoners getting into
the building, and all this stuff. Was awful. That building was originally a bank, and
it was owned by a Jewish person. The name was called — like you have here
Citibank, so that was called the Petschek bank. And he was known, you know, like
you know here Rockefeller, so he was known there as Petschek the banker, you
know. But what you have seen, yes, e-every 12 o’clock, a new guard came to
replace the guard from the day before. So you have seen the power, the might what
they had at that time. The streets were — that particular location was at, that had all
American presidents there. It was a Hoover Street, it was a Wilson Street, and there
were more of them. So why they hurried there, I don’t know, but that was that bank
which they used for the Gestapo, you know.
Q: Was — was the Gestapo headquarters, now was that parallel to Vlasov’s
ginanisty(ph)?
A: Yes.
Q: Then I know the building.
A: Vlasov’s ginanisty(ph), you are absolutely right. Vlasov’s ginanisty(ph), it goes
this way —

probably just to show gratitude that they made —
Q: Made.
A: — established the Czech Republic, or Czechoslovakia at that time, you know.
But wi — again, the life was, before the Nazis came, that was — we had the same
freedom like here. There was no religious discrimination of any kind. If you were
Jewish, you went to a Jewish temple, if you were Catholic, you went to a Catholic —
Q: Church.
A: — church, or wherever you went. That has changed. People became more — well,
maybe afraid. Maybe that some of the true feeling also might have come out, you
never know.

Heydrich was — you know, we had something called I-a-n-y, Lany. Lany was like
we have here in the United States, Camp David.
Q: I see.
A: You see, when the president wants to relax, we — whichever president, they don’t
go into politics, you went to Camp David because that was the summer, or the
relaxation for the existing president. So we had that Castle Lany. And Heydrich
was known that he travels between Lany and Prague, because he wanted to enjoy
the same thing like —
Q: Right.
A: — the president enjoyed that Lany, you know, the castle which was there. But
somehow those partisans which were dropped by the British, they found out his
route, and eventually, naturally, killed him by — I don’t exactly remember any more.
The car was passing, and somehow exploded, or whatever. But it was big
repercussions, yeah, because he was really the right hand of Hitler. So when they
killed the right hand of Hitler, you know, they wanted to show — and you know,
they traced it back — I don’t know if you heard that story, they tri — they traced it
back that those partisans were staying, or were dropped off in a town called Lidice.
And out of sympathy, naturally, here in the United States, in Chicago, there is a

suburb called Lidice. Now, I don’t know if they have changed it since then, or
whatever, but there’s a strong Czech community in Chicago, and they wanted to
show that somehow the — the west stands with that particular event. But, of — of
course I remember it, and there were pictures of Heydrich left and right. He was the
right hand of Hitler, no doubt about it.
Q: Now in — now, when they burst in in the middle of the night, that means it wasn’t
the same night that heyd — or the same day that Heydrich had been attempted —

took all these men, people — and not only men, boys — from the town of Lidice, and
they burned it down. Females had — I don’t know whether they took the females, but
it was awful, awful. And that kind of event warns the rest of the people, you know,

A: — you know, talk with Jews, and — and the fear was spread all over. So it’s not
like th-the people were against you. No, I told you, my best friend, he was playing
soccer with me. Who cares whether he was Jewish or Catholic, or whatever. But the
fear was there. So, out of fear, there was a certain — call it segregation.
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: And — and it was imposed by — by the system, you know.
Q: Okay, now let’s jump to after the war. When you came back, how did life
develop for you out of your sister-in-law’s apartment? After that, you get better, it’s
A: Well, I told you, somehow — I don’t know how I got the apartment, because there
were also Germans who were thrown awa — not thrown away, but they made them
go back to Germany, or whatever. So I don’t know how I got the apartment.
Certainly didn’t pay for it, I had no money, I was a kid. Was it allotted to me by
someone? I don’t remember that part. I know I stayed with Georgine until — and
then her aunt, the one they were talking about, the close, she came to visit us when
she was expecting George, the one who is a doctor near Washington, D.C. She was
expecting him, and that was the first time she came to Prague and the first time they
met her, so to speak.
Q: Also, excuse me, we haven’t talked about how did Georgine come back’?

A: Well, Georgine, I don’t know how she came back, physically, but I think, which
I mentioned to you, the French were trying desperately to put people together.
Q: Okay.
A: Now, if you think who paid for it, definitely nobody. That was the government’s
somehow obligation, or whatever. Georgine was sick, and I remember very
distinctly, when she came, there were two of her good, best friends who really made
her survive. Did I remember the name? One was, I think, Ruth but they call her
Chekruthka(ph), and I forgot the second one. But they were not from Prague, so
they stayed in Prague for a couple of days before they got the connection to
wherever they going. One was through Moravia —
Q: Yeah.
A: — which was the other state of Czechoslovakia. And I think they lost, you know,
like always you lost track of each other, because people have different interests, and
Georgine, she needed surgeries. She developed a thyroid condition. The thyroid 1s
not only that it takes away your breathing, but also she developed a
[indecipherable] on the — on this side. That would be her left side, I think it was. So
she had to have that taken out. It was not taken out in Czechoslovakia, but she was
treated from it. Always the truth, 1t was taken out when we came here, in New York
City. Not at the hospital, there used to be small op — small practices. That was done

on Park Avenue. Don’t hold me to it, but I remember it was on 83" Street, I think,
between Park and Madison, closer to Park. And it had to be taken out, because the
doctor said here that she would — she would have difficulties. Now, come to think of
it, why was it not done in Australia? She had it in Australia. But, you know,
Australia of 19 — when we got there, 1949, was a different Australia than 2013.
Q: That’s right.
A: They were very backwards. Not because they were dumb or something, it was the
location. They were so far away from anything, that 1-1t —
Q: That’s right.
A: — it was — it was a different Australia. That’s why we also changed the name,
because when I said my name is Pekarek, it was like talking to, you know, God
knows what. So 1-it was — it was very difficult. Then, since she was here, she read
her — that the treatment here is much more progressive, with nuclear energy.
Q: I want to go back to when she comes back to Prague.
A: Yeah, please.
Q: Yeah. She’s sick. Did you meet her — did she return back to your — her sister’s
apartment as well, and that’s where you met her?
A: Yeah, but we had the — we had the apartment which I told you I got in central
Prague.

she’s very sick —

Q: Right.
A: And we — even if we had the left le — leaning government, it was theirs, they got
it back. And — since they were quite well off, and they had connections to the
United States. How? The original owner was a very old man. He had quite a few
children. In those days, you know, there were not so many precautions not to get
children, or pregnant, or whatever. So he had, I think, five or six of them. And two
were living here in the United States very — before the war started. One was in
Philadelphia, and I don’t know where the other one was living. So, they got the
thing back, but because it was so left-leaning, the whole Czechoslovakia after
World War II, because the Soviet Union, we were your protectors, and the country
was really very much to the left, which we didn’t care for. So this firm had
difficulties with the labor force, because they were delivering coal, c-o-a-I-l — you
know, coal?
Q: Yeah.
A: What you — you know, don’t forget, nowadays, you have have gas, you have all
kinds of things.

A: — for a company which was selling coal.
Q: Okay.
A: And the owner was an old man, he had several sons, but two of them worked in
the firm. And it was a very successful firm.
Q: Okay, so now when they come back, they reclaim their firm, do they — if — what
did — do they eventually leave it, because you’re talking about this left-leaning
government?
A: Yes, yes, that’s what I wanted to tell you.
Q: So tell me.
A: One of — so when — when — when this more left-leaning, more left-wingish. So
eventually — I don’t remember if this was nationalized or not, those things escape
me. But Hinnek(ph), he was one of the sons, he wanted to get out, but there was

nowhere to go. To get a visa permit here was very difficult, and the two
[indecipherable] of his, well, you know, it’s very difficult to make a living here.
Thinking about millions which they had over there, they didn’t have the millions
here. So he had difficulties coming, but I promised him when I went to Australia
that I will try to see whether I could get him some documents to get to Australia.
Believe it or not, I did manage to help him, and he came to Australia eventually,
with his wife, two children, and he was driving a cab, of all things. Quite successful,
but naturally money-wise no comparison to what he had been. But I’m pretty sure
they must have had some money here, or something.
Q: Okay. So let’s go back to left leaning government in Prague. The owners are not
happy, they don’t want to stay. What makes you not happy? What specifically?
A: The left-wingish thing. Look, you — for example, there were elections. You had
to go with everybody in that firm, and to sing the name of the leader, his name was
Gotwald(ph), and — and he was the only one who was running. So, having that
experience from World War II, we have seen that the country is deteriorating.
Q: So it was — between ’40 and ’48, I was always under the impression that it was
still not a communist country.
A: No, but it was very left-wingish, yes.

Q: Okay.
A: If you liked it or not, he was the only one, and naturally he was the communist
leader. So it was — it was not hundred percent communistic, but it was getting there.
Q: Okay, so here’s the other question. You said that when the Nazis came in,
because of their policies, it affected the relationships people had with each other. So
that if you were —
A: Yes.
Q: — had a frou who was nonjew — a friend who was non-Jewish, it became — you
became estranged even through no desire of your own.
A: There is — it had nothing true with it. If you —1f you were not one of — for
example, look, your kid couldn’t go to school, to a college, if he was from a
bourgeois — they call it bourgeois family.

Q: Well, what was your family considered?
A: Well, I had no children to begin with, but there was no family left, you know, so I
didn’t have that kind of a problem, but you didn’t like it.
Q: Okay.
A: It smelled too much from controlled leftists. So Nazi — Hitler was too controlled
from the right side. This was the same damage on the left side.
Q: I have — there’s one question I forgot to ask you before.
A: Great.
Q: When did you find out what happened to your parents?
A: Well, that’s a good question. I think my sister survived, and I think she said she
gave me the date when they were, so to speak, transported from — from one camp to
the — to Auschwitz.
Q: So, from Theresienstadt?
A: Yes.
Q: I see.
A: And when — once they got to Auschwitz, there was no way that they could have

people, you know, now my father was born ’78. So when he got to Auschwitz, say
1944 - ’45, so he was close to 70, where I’m now 90, but that was a different time.
Q: Yeah, he was 64 - 65.
A: And — and you see here, you are a free person whether you live until 90 or 105.
Q: Yeah.
A: You know?
Q: Yeah.
A: But that was a controlled society. Jewish on top of it, so when they got there, they
had no chance.
Q: Okay.
A: They had no chance. So my sister knew the date, and she told me. I forgot the
date, of course, but she told me when the day came, she couldn’t hold them as a
dependent any more, and she was the — and they were deported.

you saw things developing back in Prague.

Q: Yeah. What did you — what actions did you start taking? How did things develop
A: Now see, that I couldn’t take any —
Q: — from thought to action?
A: —I—I didn’t take any, except that I want to get out with Georgine. And being of
that age, military age — now, for example, when I came back, I had to join the army.
Not that I wanted, that was a compulsory —
Q: Right.
A: — so for, I don’t remember how many months, I was — I was within the army
office, but still I was in the armed forces

exempt from that service. So I came back to the apartment which I had —

don’t know, most likely by bus, because we didn’t have a car. Have a car was a

luxury in those days. So she must have come by bus to visit me, and naturally there
was a question of money, because when you are in the military, you don’t make —
what do you make? Nothing. So there were some difficulties. Do I remember what
difficulties? Not really. Somehow we made it. You know, maybe some money was
left over from the father — her father. But you know, the — during that kind of a
situation that’s happening here to someb — not want to touch that that base, but when
people — my father-in-law, when — when they heard that this one was transported to
some camp, and this one — so, as a precaution, they gave — they had a housekeeper
of the house, which was living in the basement, so to speak. So they gave her some
money. How much? No idea. He had a factory. Remember, the time goes back now,
60 — 70 years. So plastic was a novelty. So, in Czechoslovakia, when you had —
when you bought a drink, let’s say like a Coke. Was not a Coke, like a Coke. So it
has a top that you closed, you know, but it was the old-fashioned thing, which was
very difficult and maybe not nice looking. So he did a lot, with a partner, plastic —
you know —
Q: Screw top.
A: — th-the tops which we today take for granted, you know, and [indecipherable]
Q: Yeah.

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Frank Hyde _
May 4, 2013
A: So it was a novelty, and he was doing extremely well. So he gave his
housekeeper X — no idea how much — dollar, but you keep it, and then they come
back — you know, you give it back to us. Well, there are lots of people who didn’t
come back. In that connection, I would like to refer to a story which appeared in
“The Wall Street Journal’ not more than maybe two weeks ago, and I gave it to
Elise to read. Why? Because it turned out that New York state, there are unclaimed
insurance policies, monies which were left around in banks. In the bill — b — in the
billions. And the story was that New York state can get this if it stays unclaimed,
because there is a law, if you don’t claim X after so many years, it becomes the
property of the state. So naturally, New York state, I can imagine if they could get a
couple of million, perhaps billion, oh my gosh, you know?
Q: Yeah.
A: So that was the story, and I have no doubt, insurance companies, banks, and I’m
telling to you out of experience, Georgine knew that her father had the life
insurance policy with X — I forgot the name. So when we came here, we tried to get
in touch with those people, we found some document showing that he had this, and
he had that, and whatever. So the answer which we got, if I would look for it, I
would find it. I’m not going to take the time now —
Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: — and I will not take the time then either. But they responded that we have to
produce a death certificate. Now, to get a death certificate for somebody who passed
away in Auschwitz, is like — I don’t have to tell you. So nothing happened. But that
means that that policy was never consummated. So, if he was entitled to those
benefits, 10,000 - 100,000, whatever, that was never paid. So really, the unclaimed
amounts which are there, must be in the — well, I’m telling you, the story was — they
mentioned ski — I think, two billion dollars. Because I’m sure my father-in-law
wasn’t the only person who did this.
Q: But you’re talking — when you’re talking about where they were unclaimed, it
was in the — Czechoslovakia where it was unclaimed?
A: Yeah, yeah, in Czechoslovakia, yeah, yeah.
Q: Yeah, yeah. Okay.
A: Yeah, but there’s — if the money would have been somehow, say inherited by
Georgine, or — or somehow —
Q: Right. That’s right.

A: Oh yes. Oh, definitely, because you didn’t know what the other person would do
to enhance his position, whatever he was doing, he or she, yes. It was not the same
Czechoslovakia, no. And that is in a way part of what you’re asking me, why didn’t
— it was not just this threat from the Soviet Union, we didn’t have anything, so what
would I have taken, and we just came back. But it was everything, you know, the
distrust of each other. The quality of life wasn’t the same. By far not the same.
Religion, the religion we didn’t practice a religion anyhow, so that didn’t make any
different. But the life was not the same, no. You talked to a neighbor, you were
afraid in case you say something, it might be turned over against you. If you were
more on the liberal side, rather than communistic side. If you said you don’t like —
I’m just saying —

it was not the same country for two reasons. Unfortunately, the German occupation
did it, and the Russian threat continued during it. So that was not that

because we were thrilled that we are free. We were free. So, for us, we didn’t see it.
But she s — she was, like I say, a different oy — age, from a different country. She
saw it differently, you know? The way she was living, I remember certain things,
that she was living in Vienna, she married in Vienna. And she came to Prague with
her husband, and sh — I can’t tell you the year. Oh, it must have been before °39,
before Hitler came. She was saying that this is a unstoppable wave, that anything
what is somehow German, will become Nazi German. And I think she was right.
Why? I told you earlier, because Hitler provided jobs, and even the people who
were — who had nothing to do with it, became pro-Nazi. I like to say Nazi
Germany, because I don’t blame today’s generation for what happened 50 - 70
years ago. Le — I mean, these people who are today Germans — I mean, of course
they are German, because they were born there, I mean, they questioned their old
grandparents. I mean, how could you have not known, or why could you have

for the British consulate on Rockefeller Center.
Q: Yeah.
A: How long, I can’t — I don’t remember, short while, then she got another job. But
that’s not the issue. So she was lucky that she could have stayed home. She stayed
home when she became pregnant. Well, that was another reason why she had all that
surgery, because they were saying, if you treat it with nuclear energy, she will
become sterile. And as a young woman, you know, you didn’t like that. So she had
the surgery rather than the —

few months to get to that place. So she was very happy, she was a hundred percent
mother. And having seen all these children perish in Auschwitz, she devoted her life
to children. Truth is the truth. So she went when John was six, kindergarten, or
whatever that system is here. She started to be on the school board. Not as a teacher,
she was never a teacher. And through her persistence, integrity, or interest,
whatever, she was on the school board for 32 years.

doctorate. She has a couple of honorary doctorates. What I’m telling you, like I just
told you, I am not a person who will make things bigger than they are —
Q: Yeah.
A: — this is the truth. Where it is now, I don’t know. Elise has a tendency to change
things. Which is fine, I’m — she’s a very hardworking person, and I told you, I like
all three of them. What happened to it, I don’t know, it was always hanging here. So
maybe they put it inside, or something, I don’t know.
Q: Okay.
A: Was a proclamation of one university, honorary doctorate in, like they called
letters, or something? Like writing.
Q: Did you — did you talk with one another about what you both went through, a lot?
A: Very little.
Q: Very little.
A: No, no, because she has the same like I went. Luckily, we both came back.
Q: But you know, here’s another thing that’s unusual. You got married, so that you
wouldn’t be called up for the army. Everybody —
A: At that time we don’t be deported —

Q: And then when you’re together, you’re young, but somewhere after
Theresienstadt, you’re separated. And you go through the kinds of experiences that
can shatter a person.
A: Yes.
Q: You both survive, you come back, and then you spend a lifetime together. That’s
unusual. I mean, so many people — that is, so many people can come back from such
traumatic experiences, and they’re changed inside.
A: Well, we — we changed to a certain extent. She got involved with the schools.
Q: Okay.
A: And I was ma — much more, say for going to the Metropolitan Opera. So I —
financial were different. So I bought a subscription for two of us. Naturally, we were
married —
Q: Right.
A: — we were vi — di— we used to go, there was a show here on Broadway,
whatever it was, not important. So we had tickets, two tickets to go to the
Metropolitan Opera. But now all of a su— oh John — Frank, I won’t be able to
make it because I have to see Commissioner so and so from the education
department. So I had two tickets, I went, and I sold one, or gave it away, or whatever

I did. So that went on for about three years like that, that I had two tickets, very
seldom we used them.
Q: Yeah.
A: Seldom. But we still had the same interest, we had the same background. We
knew our parents, her parents, it was the same. She knew my parents, of course. So
nothing really has changed, really. And proof is what I’m saying is we are —
Q: Seventy-one years.
A: And then — and — and financially I told you what it cost. If you multiply by 50,
and multiplied by five, six years, you don’t talk about 10 dollars.
Q: No.
A: Do [have any regrets? No. I consider this is my responsibility, no.
Q: What it — just for the sake of the interview, we’re talking about Georgine, who is
no longer able to participate in —
A: Very little.
Q: — normal activities. Who is we — not well.
A: Well, my — there was a story in the papers. If you want to read it, we have made
copies, that goes back about two, three years. You know what, I tell you something,
I have to go to my office, and give you a copy.

Interview with Frank Hyde

A: Our life has changed, my life in particular. Because now, I go to eat dinner at
four o’clock. I come home when Bibi comes, she comes usually at six, I come
usually home at 5:15 - 5:30, because it’s only a mile. So I come home. We either
bring them, or they [indecipherable] or whatever, that’s not the issue. And then she,
when Bibi comes, six o’clock, summertime, wintertime, I go to sleep. And again, I
told you, my hours have shifted.
Q: Yeah.
A: I get up at two o’clock, three o’clock.
Q: Yeah.
A: Do I complain? No, I just — this is fine, this is the life it is, my obligation. She’s
sick, so either you get [indecipherable] not me [indecipherable] or you do what
you have to do. And I feel this is what I have to do. We married, we were kids. My
responsibility was the same as it was 50 years ago.
Q: When you —
A: Before you go, I give you the story from the newspaper.
Q: Okay.
A: Free of charge.
Q: Okay.
A: They — they made copy — made a bunch of copies.

Q: And the story from the newspaper is about what?
A: Well, is what I’m telling you, that we were separated because of Auschwitz.
Q: Oh, I see, it’s about you. The story from the newspaper is about you, okay.
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, about — well, it was about both of us, but actually it’s more
about what I’m doing with — you know, I was always working.
Q: Yeah.
A: Some of u — I mean, one of us had to make a living.
Q: Did you feel like you were a different person when you came back from
Auschwitz, though?
A: Oh sure — oh, from Auschwitz, of course. I was a grown-up man, I was a kid
when I went in. No, no question about it. You understood what life is, what brutality
is. Don’t forget, there were instances where some prisoners wanted to escape.
Russian in particular, I have to say the truth. You know, we had to witness when
they were literally beaten to death. Why did they ask us to witness this? To
discourage other people from doing it. And that’s pi — after all these years, I’m still
seeing it once in a while. When I start thing like now, talking about it. Sure. Was
awtul. So you have grown up, no question about it. You were a child, you were
inexpere — when we came out, we were children. I wanted to buy the house. They
were talking about real estate ex — I had no clue. So this friend — not friend, she was

a client of mine, said well, do you have any money? Remember, 3,000 dollars down
payment. Was a different down — different time.
Q: In the 1950s here.
A: Yeah. So I said, not really. Sh-She said to me — I will never forget her, well you
can’t just get a mortgage without having some money in the bank. For me that was,
you know, a revelation, what is she talking about? So she loaned me 3,000 dollars,
which was 10 percent from what was needed for the down payment. Of course I paid
her back, this is not the question. But that’s how it was.
Q: Well, one of the things that I find — something that I can’t imagine, because I’ve
had a normal life, rather than this kind of life.
A: Well, we didn’t have the normal life. You said the right thing.
Q: You know, is one of the things that — when somebody goes through something
like that, and they see this kind of brutality, can you ever really laugh again? Can
you — when do you start enjoying life again?
A: Well, you know, truthfully, you try to push it away, you know, and you
concentrate on what we did together. You know, we went shopping together. She
was normal, don’t forget, she was a normal person.
Q: Yeah.
A: So — not that I’m putting her down or something —

Interview with Frank Hyde
May 4, 2013
Q: No, no, no, no, no, no
A: — I’m just saying the true, we used to go to Lord & Taylor, I remember. When
we bought the house, we — we bought a car. And you just look out the window
there’s a tree, stupidly we planted it right next to the house. Well, we went — I had a
Chevy, and we thought to make it more — more trees. So we bought a tree which
was bigger than this thing here. Well, now it’s 50 years ago, now it’s tremendous,
you know. So we were sharing life together. She grew into it, I grew into it, but we
grew into it together, not separately. Separately was only the circumstance which —
which made us separate, you know?
Q: Got it.
A: And that was a story in the paper, you know. I couldn’t get out of
Czechoslovakia because of that military age. Well, I managed to get that British
passports, so that was not a pretense of some kind of divorce or separation.
Q: That’s right.
A: It was just to survive. We was just so panicky with survival.
Q: Yeah.
A: And — and the only way to do it was well, you go first, and somehow I managed
to get out by myself, because I will take a suitcase and go. But now, if we are two,
it’s a different thing.

Q: Yeah.
A: And that’s exactly what happened, so when I f — got to stay, I told you before,
she took the plane and came back. Of course she came back.
Q: Is there —
A: — was not some kind of a second marriage, or something.
Q: No. Is there — no. Is there — is there anything that you’d like to add to what we’ve
talked about today, that you think it’s important for —
A: If I would take it back?
Q: No, no, no. Is there something you would like to add?
A: Oh, add. Well, the only experience I would like to tell you about, when I was
working for General Motors, which I told you, photography here. When I went to
General Motors, no English. So, since I had some experience from the concentration
camp Model As.
Q: Yeah.
A: So my sister go to General Motors, they pay good salary, 10 pounds, or whatever
it was in those days, and I was having [indecipherable] which is something like
this, and then the tube goes in like this. And I was working on brake drums. Now the
brake drums, where they come out of the foundry are very rough, which is

Interview with Frank Hyde

Q: Right.
A: — brake pedal and stuff. So naturally, since everybody knows how not handy I
am, I am still saying that GM went down financially because of the automobiles wh-
which I fixed up. But they are still recalling the cars which I did. Well, of course
that’s a joke —
Q: Of course.
A: — because there are gauges, they called the gauges —
Q: Right.
A: — and it was after every so often you had to check to be sure that it’s that way.
Q: Yeah.
A: But I'll leave that story a-apart from what I was doing. Well, then we came here,
you know, here was — you started to work, you went to school, learning English,
accounting, expressions, and English to begin with. I told you we thought in
Prague, five o’clock tea, we speak English, you know? Was very different —

Arabs. If there are terrorists, yes, but we talk about normal people. He was in real
estate, then we became business friends, very pleasant person. And I went with him
to Paris. [indecipherable] if it was two days, four days, if I don’t remember, you
know.
Q: So have you been back to Europe?
A: I went back to Paris twice.
Q: Only?
A: But not Prague, or anything like that, no, no.

A: Well, she was not keen, Georgine, and then she always had something, well you

not that she was hiding behind the school —

A: — Georgine’s friend. And she is the one who is alerting me to the thing that
Monday she was stop eating, because she will forget how to eat, you know.
Q: Yeah.
A: But she knew that reporter. Georgine also knew him for quite a while. And they
somehow thought it was a great story, you know.
Q: It is a great story.

marriage. Not too many people are married 70 years.

Interview with Frank Hyde ms

Q: Okay.
A: — airplane bombing, or whatever you want to call it. Of course I know where I
was. I was with a client in — in his house, and I don’t know why he had the
television on at that day, that I don’t remember. But we had it on for some reason or
another, and then I saw it. Well, I saw that the pilot made a mistake, of course. Why
would I think that it’s a terrorist attack? And the same things with Auschwitz. Why
would anybody think that a sophisticate nation like the Germans would come up
with something like this because of religion, or where you come from? Unheard of.
And the same is with that 9/11, where did you think that that would be planned?
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: Now when you see it again, you know, the — you know what happened. And if
something in the future would come up with some crazy person like Hitler was,
maybe — maybe the world will not make the same mistake. There was a wonderful
story, “Wall Street Journal’ — I’m not trying to sell the “Wall Street Journal,” but
that’s what I’m reading, so that’s what I’m talking about. They were talking about
the preemptive stri-strike. If someone like this happened to be somewhere, they were
talking about Iran, that you shouldn’t wait until it’s too late. And whoever wrote it
was a historian, or whatever it was. Was a couple days ago, I gave it to Elise to read.

heavy industry, and the military.
A: And the story said, maybe five million people would not have been killed. Well,
you know, she would have something what you should have done. God knows. But
maybe you not have the will of the way into Auschwitz, you know? God knows. I —
I don’t know. I lived through it, it was there. I — I told you I — the times, from time to
time, when I — when I was [indecipherable] and all that stuff, you know? God
knows. But people make the same mistakes, ye — they don’t learn from history, you
know.
