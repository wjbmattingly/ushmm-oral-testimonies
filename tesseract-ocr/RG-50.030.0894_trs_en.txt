August 24, 2016
A: Not at all. Agnostic.
Q: Agnostic, okay. Had your — were your grandparents agnostic as well, or Jewish —
A: I didn’t know my — that — we were always Jews.
Q: Always Jews, mm-hm.
A: But that was more a — a— how can I explain that? Actually, there — there was mu
—not much said about it, or I didn’t have any, you know, recollection of a f— of any
religious upbringing, because they were agnostic. And they were very political.
That’s one of the thing.
Q: Okay. So you knew you were Jewish, but —
A: Yeah.
Q: — didn’t celebrate any of the holidays, or —
A: Well, I really knew it in — after 1937, when Jewish children could no longer go to
school with Gentile children. And I then went to a Jewish private school, attached to
the synagogue, but it was foreign to me, you know? And then, of course, as I
became older, I became fanatically Jewish.
Q: Oh.
A: You know, I di — it was very important to me.
Q: Mm-hm. So you mentioned that your father was a very proud German.

A: Right. He was — you know, it — businessman who was much admired in Cologne,
which is the city where I come from. And he was very active in Cologne politics.
Q: And you — you lived in a house by the Rhine?
A: Right.
Q: Could you tell us a little bit about the house, maybe, you know, how big it was,
what did it look like, and —
A: Well, it’s interesting, because we visited Cologne years ago, with the children,
and it wasn’t there any more, th — it had been bombed, so I can’t really — I can only
tell you what I remember, which was it, you know, typical European, three story
house, near the Rhine. And that’s all I remember.
Q: But you can see the —
A: I have a very selective memory, you know. There’s some things I don’t
remember, because I guess I, you know, don’t want to remember. So —

very proud to have been in the army, and he was a — I’ve forgotten what his rank
was, but as a Jew though, he could no longer — he did — the rank could not be higher
than sergeant, I think. I’m not quite sure of that.

mother wanting to leave Germany, and my father kept talking about it’s blowing
over, and it would be okay, and wanted to stay. He was a very proud German. Much
good it did him.
Q: But he — he believed that it would — it was just a phase, it would —
A: Yeah, it was just a phase, right, exactly.
Q: — you know, just — yeah, just stick it out, wait and see.
A: And I remember many, many arguments. And then, in 1937, Jewish children
could no longer go to school with Gentile children, so that’s when I became a Jew,
really.
Q: Yes, ma’am.
A: What?
A2: There is something that is important. You asked about my mother’s family, and
their life. Their life was — my grandmother was an opera singer —
Q: Oh, wow.
A2: — and also an artist, and had salons in their home. So it was a very — they were
very socially — socially accepted, upper middle class family, and the factory that
they owned was my grandmother’s parents’ factory. You might want to ask my
mother more about what the factory made, and —

August 24, 2016
Q: Wow. You were so impressed, and —
A: Well, my parents were so agnostic, that I didn’t have very much of a Jewish
education or upbringing, until I left. S-So — and then I really, you know, because it
was the Jewish community in London that sponsored 10,000 children to leave. So I
was one of those.
Q: So before these new laws start being passed in Germany, did you have both
Jewish and non-Jewish friends?
A: A lot of non-Jewish. My father was in business in the carnival industry, which is

A: Right. It — 1t was — it started — it was attached to the synagogue in Cologne, and
all the children from the Rhineland went there. They had to travel a lot in order to
get to Cologne, you know, all the surrounding cities, because they could no longer
go to school with Gentile children.
Q: Yeah. What was it like having to move, leave all of your friends at school, and
completely —

children that — that — the Jewish community in London got the children out.

A: Yeah, we di— we went to Europe with the children, because it was time that they
found out where their mother came from. So we went to Cologne. And it’s really
kind of a funny da — story, when we stayed in a hotel in Cologne, which was where I
was from. And we went to see where — the house I was born in, and my parents were
born in, you know, in Europe you — that’s what you do, you stay in the —
Q: Yeah.
A: And the house was no longer there, and the street was no longer there. And I
remember getting — going back to the hotel, and the clerk at the hotel was sort of
rubbing his hands, and what did you think about, you know, where you were from.
And my husband said, we went — we — we — the street wasn’t there, and the house
wasn’t there, when we went to look for it. And he sort of rubbed his hands and said,
this is what the English did to us by night, and the Americans by day. And it was
Cologne flattened, and — and I remember my husband handing back the photograph
and saying, fantastic, precision bombing. And we left, right after that. So, that was
our experience in Germany.
Q: Did you go back to the cathedral?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah? What was it like, after — no.
A: Was standing. No bombs had hit it. That was really fantastic, precision bombing.

A: Yeah, but that’s it. I mean, that’s — no. I don’t even remember, I don’t have
friends who — you’re the only one who pursued it a little bit. You know, I just — I
think part of it is because I was an adolescent, and I — it was more important for me
to, you know, disappear into the community. So —
Q: To integrate, and —
A: Right, exactly.
Q: Yeah. Is there anything you wish people knew, about living in Germany, or in
England, during the times that you did?
A: Yeah. It’s very foreign to most people. They don’t — you know, my age, do not
remember any of that. So it’s like, you know, that new experience, to tell them about
it, but I da — hardly ever do, you know, talk about it.
Q: And why is that?
A: I don’t know. Because it is — it’s not something people have experienced, and it’s
hard to, you know, tell them about that time.
Q: Yeah. Is there anything we haven’t talked about, that you would like to add? Any
— anything we didn’t cover, in the rest of the interview?

age, if there are people that you interview, will have had the same experiences. It
