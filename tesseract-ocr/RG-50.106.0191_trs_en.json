            "answer": "German and I even spoke the local dialect when I played soccer with the kids or the boys but at the dinner table we were expected to speak reasonably correct German. My parents cautiously spoke French when they didn\u2019t want the children to understand whatever it is they were talking about. Later they switched to English.

Yes, I liked to think I was independent but on the other hand up to the age of 13 or 14 you are necessarily dependent and in our home, my father made the decisions. That does not mean he disregarded my mother, but he clearly was in charge. He is the one who decided that I would attend a secondary school known as a gymnasium where one of the foreign languages was Latin. And as he said, in my day we had to take Latin and Greek."

            "answer": "Within walking distance there was an elementary school with two wings. One wing, the larger was Protestant. The other wing, smaller, was Catholic. I attended the Protestant wing. I could have been excused from religious instruction which was part of the curriculum. I was not and I attended and to this day I remember some Protestant catechism. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Arnstein 6 October 23, 2011 It was within walking distance. It was a public school, strangely enough, co-educational. There were 20 boys and ten girls. And I have a photograph taken in third grade or second grade.

He broke his neck skiing in the Italian Alps at age, 18, something like that which meant that my grandfather had to decide on a burial plot to bury Uncle Ernest whom I never knew of course. And he picked a plot in the Protestant section of the cemetery. Not the Jewish section. I cite that as an example. And that, of course, it\u2019s then where my grandfather was buried in the family plot. So was my maternal grandfather. That it\u2019s an indirect answer to your question."

One was schlemiel, and the other one was plite [ph] which means bankrupt but it 1s so part of the German language. Anyway I did not know those were Jewish words. Oy, well there was once in the edition, there was instant Yiddish."

            "answer": "No but I do remember after the Nazis came to power, about 1935 my sister and I went to Gelingen [ph] which 1s a village not far from Stuttgart where there was a Jewish training center, presumably preparing people for Palestine. And all I remember from that 1s that I did not like the taste of horseradish and that is all I remember."

            "answer": "Oh I remember the first two books I owned. One was in German of course, Classical mythology. In a version which 1s kind of poetic. It 1s so good that it has, that version has been translated into English and published in the United States. By an author named Schwab, S-C-H W-A-B. Ihave fond memories of that. And the other book was in German, Ein Come from Rome [ph] , a battle for Rome. It deals basically with the invasion of the Goths, the, and of course, I identified with the Goths, the victorious Goths. I still remember those two books were a present from a cousin from Nuremberg."

But no, there was a cousin named Uncle Emil who owned the factory and he arrived with a black chauffeur driven limousine but it was an Opel. It wasn\u2019t even a Mercedes.

            "answer": "First of all nothing changed in, among the boys in my neighborhood. We continued to play soccer and we continued, this was before bicycles. We had scooters but then gradually. Nothing happened in any significant way until the Nuremberg laws which meant that we could no longer have a full time housekeeper and that probably led to an explanation by my parents that we were different."

She was engaged to a gentile Bavarian who was terrific. He, they took me skiing. They owned a small Fiat. At the age of 12 on country roads, I was allowed to drive. So no wonder I think well of him. And they of course, she converted to Catholicism. She became a Catholic, a convert. It didn\u2019t do any good and moved to Stuttgart and became kind of an older sister to us, or she was appreciably older but she became part of our household and most significantly she owned a car and we were mechanized for the first time. I cite this only as a reasonably vivid recollection of the influence of the Nuremberg laws and the realization that we were different and Marianne was different. The other significant difference is that swimming pools started to have signs saying no Jews allowed. And \u2014"

Easter 1938 I had not done my homework or I was late for class or some minor offense like that and the home room teacher took me to task and said George, or Georg of course, you who are a guest in this country. And that, that scored. I remember it today. My father had offered me earlier, had raised the question didn\u2019t I want to transfer and go to school in Geneva, 1n Switzerland. Where there were family friends with a son my age who were going to look after me. Easter 38 I went home and I told my father I\u2019m ready to go to Geneva.

And I was number 11 or number 12 1n size and when the teams were chosen, I was also chosen, something like 11\" or 12\". That\u2019s significant. There are 11 soccer players to a side. But the point I\u2019m getting at is there were two guys who basically deliberately followed me. And the teacher, alias umpire, didn\u2019t see it.

            "answer": "Oh yes, of course. You know for example, my father being the owner of the building, was expected to fly a flag prominently on patriotic occasions and he chose the local colors, provincial colors which were red and black, the city colors were black and yellow. But not the swastika and not black, white and red which were the alternate national colors. And we got away with it."

He was promoted from approximately corporal and made lieutenant. He was wounded twice. I don\u2019t know how badly. He had impaired, what 1s it called, taste buds but no other evidence of permanent damage. He had medals. He wore them once and put them away in the drawer. I saw them once. In fact I still own them. But he was not terribly patriotic. And there are two explanations for that. His mother, my grandmother was born in San Francisco. So he had -- she came to Stuttgart at age 12 more or less. Her English was there but not fluent. Nevertheless that made a difference. He, she was one of six sisters, three of them married Germans. But one married a Frenchman, one married an Englishman. So my father had first cousins in London. He had first, a first cousin in Paris which is how he spent a year there learning English and learning French, which also probably explains why he was less patriotic than one would think of a German lieutenant. While we\u2019re on that theme let\u2019s finish it. After Kristallnacht the night of broken glass, I was in Geneva. I only read about it. He was arrested the following morning. He was sent to the local police station, our part of town, told to empty his pockets and what came out among other things was orders for reserve lieutenant Arnstein to report for either a physical exam or I don\u2019t remember those detail. It didn\u2019t do any good. He still wound up at Dachau. But as long as we were on the military theme I thought I\u2019d include that. Kind of confusing.

I knew my father listened to radio Strasbourg which broadcast in French and in German. Deliberately. I also knew that this was either illegal but anyway one didn\u2019t talk about it.

The socialists also had a symbol, not the swastika of course but three parallel arrows and I remember three arrows were painted on our sidewalk. Which meant the following morning somebody had to scrub and remove them. There was an annual winter relief drive where they collected nowadays we\u2019d collect canned goods, but in those days it was clothing and things like that. That used to be done by the army. It was now being done by brown shirted storm troopers. So there were changes and there is that terrible word which I don\u2019t know how to translate and I don\u2019t think anybody else does either. Gleich Schaltung.[ph] which kind of means coordination, coordination, https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Arnstein 13 October 23, 2011 penetration, where everything was made over and the example of the winter relief drive is an example. It used to be the army and theoretically neutral and now it became storm troopers. Gleich Schaltung spelled G-L-E-I-C-H one word. S-C-H-A-L-T-U-N-G. I do not know how to translate it.

His name was Herman. His father was a minor government official. He joined the junior version of the Hitler Youth. He then join -- well I wasn\u2019t there when he joined the senior version and he became a lieutenant in the German army. And I looked him up at the end of the war when I was a GI. And he had just been discharged from an American POW cage. So we explored our old neighborhood together. (Laughs) He had been gone and I had been gone."

I also remember one incident where Herman and I were going a block or two away, possibly on our scooters and ran into a couple of other boys who started making anti-Semitic remarks like oh https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Arnstein 14 October 23, 2011 you can smell a Jew a mile away and this and that. And Herman would knowing full well that I was Jewish which I realize contradicts some of my earlier comments, kind of goaded them on into saying oh we can smell one. We can see one.

I have a report from a distant relative who claims he invoked the help of Senator Wagner. That\u2019s senior. I don\u2019t know how true that is, but maybe he, anyway they reclaimed their citizenship.

In other words they had common grandparents and who supplied the affidavit which was rejected by the American counsel in Stuttgart, on the grounds that the cousin in San Francisco was too old. Thereupon the cousin\u2019s daughter co-signed and that made it legitimate.

I don\u2019t remember that clearly because after all money was not discussed with the children. But so within two weeks, I transferred, as I recall. Very quickly I transferred to Geneva.

I have since recovered some of this information because the grandson of the owner of the shoe factory published the memoirs of his grandfather. All of this was in the past year. And I have some of the details wrong. But he had a good job with this shoe factory, probably as the, the leather buyer or I don\u2019t know that. What I do remember is it was still dark and a winter night at 7:30 in the morning when he joined a car pool. A car pool, probably he, the brother of the owner who had a car and they drove out to the suburbs to go to work. But that somehow or other sticks in my memory. But by the time the Nazis came to power, maybe the factory ran into problems. I don\u2019t know. He reestablished his business on a minor scale. Instead of having a separate office and storage facility he operated out of his mother\u2019s, my grandmother\u2019s apartment where he had an office. My aunt, his sister, unmarried was kind of secretary. And I don\u2019t know those details because money business was not discussed in front of the children.

In33 we went to Fronten [ph] which is in the Bavarian, in Bavaria close to the Austrian border. In 1934 Hitler had imposed a thousand mark duty if you wanted to cross over from Germany into Austria. In an attempt to of course choke it off. And that was our last summer in Bavaria. Then we Started going to Switzerland for summer vacations. But I remember that very vividly, how the change was from one year to the next. We could go into Austria one year. And then no longer. Austria being a piddling distance away. So the change of going to Switzerland was fairly significant in the sense my father wanted to read different newspapers.

Hans and I got in a discussion, disagreement when I told him, yes I have since found out there was a Stuttgart chapter of B\u2019Nai Brith and it had a clause saying no Polish Jews admitted or wanted. And he said oh no you\u2019re wrong. So we pulled down the book that, I was right. It\u2019s probably the only time in my life that Hans was wrong."

My Aunt Nellie, single unmarried sister of my father, her lift came. Well because she\u2019s unmarried, she lived with her mother, my grandmother. To this day I have inherited a few things that go back to my grandmother and I sometimes fail to make the distinction whether it was my home or hers. There is a certain continuity.

            "answer": "No. Or marginally. But following on that question, we were hung up in New York for six weeks, because of an idiosyncrasy of the German currency regulations. You could prepay your voyage to San Francisco in German marks, provided it was by ship. You could not go by rail. We were prepaid to San Francisco and then the American company would not recognize the ticket. And so we spent six weeks in New York and then they relented on a winter luxury cruise that was not sold out, from New York to Havana. To Panama, to Acapulco, to Los Angeles, to San Francisco. We were in a third class cabin but these cruises give you the run of the ship and it was an unlikely beginning. And I remember it did not have an outdoor pool. It had an indoor pool. They built an outdoor pool by throwing together some wooden frame and lining it with a canvas. And to this day I remember crossing the Panama Canal, floating in this outdoor pool and saying if I ever amount to something, I would like to do this again, which my wife and I did some 25 years ago. Not in a canvas covered pool. Sorry that\u2019s a detour but hung up in New York, I actually enrolled in public school number 12345, in the eighth grade which I flunked because I didn\u2019t know enough English. I was farmed out to some relatives who had emigrated earlier than we did. And lived in Jack, not in Jackson Heights. In the part of Manhattan that there \u2014"

As they crossed the Rhine from Kale [ph] to Strasbourg, my father got up and spit in the Rhine or did something symbolic that I don\u2019t remember the details.

I don\u2019t remember. They handed me a box, cigar box size. Wrapped as a gift. Told me to put it under the seat, not tell anybody and retrieve it afterwards. And that is how a good deal of jewelry was smuggled out. I don\u2019t know all those details because children are not initiated into financial affairs. But he used various devices to accumulate some money. There was another fortunate thing. The provider of the affidavit, a first cousin of my grandmother\u2019s, obviously an old lady because she was turned down, being too old for the affidavit, died within half a year after we got there. And my father was in her will to the tune of one half of one percent or some ridiculous sum like that. Which turned out to be $4000. I mean it, I use the word ridiculous. Obviously I \u2014 There were things like that. And another cousin helped my mother invest the money or he borrowed some money from my mother at a high rate of interest. They did various things to help. There was another fallout which I consider very fortunate. Not only did I go to a good high school. A cousin lived within four blocks of home in a very elegant district. We didn\u2019t. They had season tickets to the San Francisco Symphony. When they couldn\u2019t go, we got the tickets. So I kind of grew up with Pierre Monteux and the San Francisco symphony. And I swear by Pierre Monteux to this day. These are the kinds of things that I think you were looking for. One other thing that fits in with your questions. In New York a cousin on my mother\u2019s side who I have since found out was born in Switzerland, but I thought he was native born American, because he was genuine American and had married a genuine American. Told my mother oh of course you\u2019re coming on either Saturday or Sunday to Temple Emanuel. Literally the first time in my life that I had been to a synagogue, of which I remember essentially nothing except that it was not that different from the Protestant services I had gone to occasionally with one of the maids or\u2014 There was organ music and there was a I think a choir but significant in terms of this interview, I think is literally the first time in my life that I set foot in a synagogue."

            "answer": "Not at all. We lived in within five blocks of Temple Emanuel to which some relatives belonged and it was there and oh I got a gift membership in the Jewish community center which had a pool and a library of comic books which helped my Americanization. That\u2019s about it. Oh, no. One other significant thing. After Pearl Harbor you may recall there were enacted a series of laws or regulations, the evacuation of the Japanese, which meant that native born Americans of Japanese descent, including my classmate Torsho [ph] were evacuated. We technically enemy aliens, were merely subject to a curfew. We could not travel more than five miles from home unless we were going directly to or from school or work. And we had to be home by eight PM, which means that I could not attend my own high school graduation in the San Francisco opera house, which was held at eight PM. And because Drummond law observing tradition, my mother said, my father was dead by then. You can\u2019t go and I didn\u2019t go. There are 27 people who have told me since then but you could have passed. It was no great deprivation for me but it answers your question of did I feel Jewish. Well this also meant that we couldn\u2019t go out Saturday night like other adolescents. So there were three or four of us who got together on Sunday afternoon because that\u2019s the best we could do on weekends."

I made it as far as the change station in Junction City, alias Junk Town. My name was not called. Why? Nobody knew. Go, go back to Fort Riley. So I did where I found out the following morning I could not be shipped overseas because I was not yet a citizen. That shipment wound up on the Anzio beach head. So they didn\u2019t know what to do with me, still not naturalized, so they sent me to advanced communication school. I was trained as a radio operator where the instructors were delighted that there were three of us who were interested in cryptography, crypto analysis. Nobody thought the fact that here an enemy alien was inducted and a crypto analysis which I never used. And in due time I was shipped out to camp McCoy, 76\" cavalry, reconnaissance troop mechanized. And then I was naturalized at Lacrosse Wisconsin and was ready for, we were then sent overseas anyway. But and didn\u2019t wind up all that well. We were committed during the Battle of the Bulge.

We were invited to the Russian parade which was across the river. Which I don\u2019t remember very clearly but it happened. There, during those six weeks, quasi-peace time in the sense that no hostilities. There I was exposed to a lot of German conversation and probably sought it out because I was curious to learn what they were like and what they were feeling. We lived in German housing that we had taken over. Long detour. This was in Limbach in Saxony. Well we had taken a corner house. And we hung an American flag from the balcony. I still have a picture of two Gls standing and the flag, not me but two fellow troopers. Four years ago I went to Berlin to meet a German historian who was also interested in this six week occupation of the later German Democratic Republic. And we had exchanged e-mails and he was fascinated. Some of the photo \u2014 oh he doesn\u2019t know much English so he found a correspondent who could correspond in German. And had photographs. He https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Arnstein 36 October 23, 2011 checked up on me. He asked me did I remember where we were billeted in Limbach. I said well it was across from a park and I vaguely remember. Maybe it was called Allee esse Strasse [ph] number 15. Here is a photograph of the house. He went. It was number 13, not number 15. But because he had a photograph. He interviewed the residents and he found a woman who said oh I was a seven year old girl and there was a German who spoke with a southern accent. It was this American who \u2014 He didn\u2019t\u2019 check up on me. He kind of wanted to authenticate. That\u2019s a lengthy detour of your question, did I interact with the Germans. Yes, after the end of hostilities a whole lot. I found a photo shop in Limbach which still had chemicals and paper and by that time a lot of Americans had acquired cameras. Liberated cameras. And asked me could I arrange to have the film developed. And I had duplicates made for my own collection. Thus I have probably the largest collection of photographs. In a different small town, I arranged for laundry service. We had to provide the soap of course but the underwear came back ironed and all of this is by way of answering your question, did I have much interaction with the Germans. Not during the combat period. Except when necessary. And of course eternally they said oh I never was a Nazi or I was this, I tended to cut them up s, cut them off short. Got to be a litany."

And by working she was reasonably well taken care of, along with half a dozen others. Those were non-Jewish volunteers. The displaced persons, Jewish, that\u2019s where I discovered that I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish but if they spoke slowly and if I repeated everything twice in German we could communicate. I didn\u2019t know there was such a language. Well I guess I did know that there were Americans who spoke Yiddish but whoever they were. I have since learned from Hans Hirsch that there is a variation called western Yiddish which my German ancestors probably spoke. Hans knows far more about that than I do. But he has educated me."

            "answer": "No. I should but I didn\u2019t. Now I do remember clearly in Yayna, [ph] for example, a town in east Germany, former East Germany. We had advanced without military government personnel. There were no, we had advanced too far. There was no provision for military government. And I was asked to improvise. And facetiously and in quotation marks, I became the chief of police of Yayna. Nobody had issued orders for all arms to be turned in for example. So I issued the order and sent out the town crier. That is how the order got amended by various Americans or all cameras had to be turned in. I did not issue that order but in fact I never acquired a camera. But we at that point I, your question was dealing with the DPs or Jews. I very clearly remember that we took over a former German garrison just explicitly as quarters for the Jewish liberated refugees, whatever you want to call them. Displaced persons today. That we tried to provide food for them because they didn\u2019t have ration stamps and things like that. But I was chief of police for six days so there\u2019s a limit to what you can accomplish. We had to improvise because while there was quite good American preparation for military government it had not extended that far east. I have actually written an essay about that particular episode because it is that unusual. And I have since read a German historian and I don\u2019t quite agree with his description of that six week occupation. I\u2019ve probably gone too far afield."

I managed to get to Paris twice. Illegal passes. And I knew I was going to be sent back to Germany because to be repatriated you had to have points. You earned one point for every month of active service. You got a second point for every month of overseas service. And you get five points for every medal or Purple Heart. Well I didn\u2019t have enough points. I had to wait my turn. So I was sent back. And assigned to Eisenhower\u2019s headquarters. US Forces, European theater. US FET. Where I was a clerk working under WAC Captain which I did not resent. Interesting now. Some of my colleagues resented it. And one of my duties was to drive a colonel to the airport or something like that. And I remember the colonel said and how do you like your job corporal. And I said frankly sir, I don\u2019t. I am bored. I have skills. I am bilingual and I am not being utilized. Incredibly enough within a week I was transferred to a suburb of Frankfurt. It was called the UT, U S Information service. It later became the US Information Service. And it was then called the Information Service Control Command. Where I wound up in a fascinating assignment. A daily, because I had a minimum of journalism exposure. A daily digest of all anti-American activities in the American sector. The werewolves, I don\u2019t know if you have ever heard of them. There were some Nazi fanatics up in the Alps who were doing terrible things to, I mean never amounted to anything but there was much talk about the werewolves. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Arnstein 39 October 23, 2011 And the other thing I remember is any number of Germans came home and found that their girlfriends or wives had been seduced by Americans or by American chocolate or cigarettes and thereupon they either cussed out the Americans or did actually something anti-American. That was the daily confirmation. But what impressed me, it was for circulation only to colonels and up. And here I was a corporal. That lasted a while. I have since tried to go to the archives and find my immortal prose. I haven\u2019t been able to find it and it\u2019s not worth the effort.

It was anti Allied. It didn\u2019t amount to anything. It was trivial. And it was probably reported more thoroughly than it was in fact. After a few weeks in Bad Hamburg editing this daily digest I asked to be transferred to the provinces and I was assigned to Regensburg which is on the Danube in Bavaria. The district information command which was doing de-Nazification work. In those days to work on a newly reconstituted newspaper or radio or no television. Or even appear on the stage. You had to go through a de-Nazification which was a questionnaire with 101 questions. And there were three of us, three Americans. In Regensburg who did this kind of de-Nazification. We also did what was no longer called censorship of the newspaper. But post publication scrutiny. Which means we read the damn thing and if we found anything objectionable we were supposed to object. Never happened. I remember with a colleague named Bill Clark who knew German but his German was atrocious. And my German of course improved daily and became much more adult. We went to the nearby town of Straubing [ph] because there were rumors that the local theater had put on an anti-American play. I don\u2019t remember the author, I think it was Kleist and it dealt with the French revolution or something like that. We enjoyed the performance, went back to Regensburg and said nothing. Straubing sticks in my memory because I ran into a German Jew and his daughter who had survived the war. I think he was married to a gentile, who alleged that he remembered my ancestral factory, 80 kilometers to the north. I did not pursue it in any https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Arnstein 40 October 23, 2011 meaningful way. It was one of the few cases where I actually encountered some vague link with my patrilineal ancestry. Well in due time at the end of Regensburg I had enough points to be repatriated. And -"

What are your thoughts about Germany today? You said you\u2019d gone back obviously on visits and lectures. Just generally what - George Arnstein: Let me detour. My wife was a powerful influence on my life, which I\u2019m sure happens in other marriages too but unusually so. She was smart, competent, sensitive, et cetera. On our first trip to Europe which she was eager to do, we also stopped off in Stuttgart, ostensibly to liquidate a wicker basket which had been deposited by my great aunt Clare with a bank in Stuttgart when Clare, American born, great aunt, and the bank had charged annually a modest deposit fee, rent. And my wife said we\u2019ve got to liquidate that. Fine, we \u2014 among other things. She also said and this is typical of my wife. I want to know where you came from. So we looked at the house we lived in. And things like that. We also went to the bank. It took half an hour to produce the wicker basket. And it contained linens, towels, 12 pieces of silverware which however is not sterling because the German standard is only 875 and sterling is 92% or something like that. And there also were a couple of arm bands and I said oh these. She said oh I think there was something. They turned out to be gold and one went to my sister and one went to Sherry. She spotted them. The linens we gave to former maids whom we also looked up. The pieces of silver, we took to a local silversmith, jewelry store. We would like to buy, we had German restitution funds. We would like to buy 12 place settings and they said we can\u2019t do that because we don\u2019t have enough silver and we can\u2019t import any. You have to have old silver to trade in. And I said well we just happen to have this pile. And literally that\u2019s how it happened and that is how today I own place settings for 12 1n almost sterling silver. You ask about my feelings about Stuttgart. This is an example of my wife\u2019s influence in, to some extent, reconciling me and on that same trip. Oh."

And so it befell to me and I inherited all these documents, from my aunt Nellie, from my mother, from my grandmother. I still have an enormous collection of them. And I successfully pursued any number of restitution claims. Successfully has its limits. They were put into blocked mark accounts because Germany in those days had no foreign currency. They were essentially bankrupt. So you could use the money within Germany but you could not, oh you could sell it in Switzerland at a terrific discount which we did a couple of times. And of course I shared everything with my mother and sister. The result is that we were wealthy when we were in Stuttgart. And in the process I engaged a lawyer in Stuttgart and got a letter from one of his interns for lack of a better name who identified himself as a former classmate who is now an apprentice lawyer. And he would fully understand if I did not want to correspond, continue the correspondence. The point is I did, and we\u2019re still friends today. His kids have visited here and et cetera. PS, his father was a printer with the pre-war Social Democratic newspaper. In other words, left leaning. So that is another, shall we say point of reference where we had access to a, oh they weren\u2019t living in Stuttgart. They had been evacuated during the war.

And in the affirmative, if you want to put it that way. Germans today are two generations removed from https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Arnstein 45 October 23, 2011 then. Every once in a while I run into somebody who of course is of my generation. And there I tend to have problems. Nothing hostile. They all behave very properly. And I behave I hope properly, but I simply don\u2019t relate to them the way I relate to younger people. There 1s an American foundation, the Obermeyer Foundation. Arthur Obermeyer is a third generation American of German Jewish descent from southwest Germany. And he has established an annual award, honoring those Germans who are doing something to keep alive the German Jewish memory. It\u2019s mostly restoration of cemeteries and that kind of stuff. And four years ago, Hans Hirsch and I and a couple of others nominated somebody successfully. And I thought ok, I\u2019ve done my thing. So Hans asked me, you\u2019re going of course. I said it hadn\u2019t occurred to me but I went. Found it very interesting and [Il spare you the details. I\u2019ve since done it three more times, mostly because we have identified various people and we\u2019re currently waiting to see whether this year\u2019s nominees were elected or not. The trip to Berlin was interesting to me also because I wanted to meet this German historian who is also interested in the six week occupation. It turns out he was conceived during that occupation of an American and a German mother. That\u2019s his motivation. And he doesn\u2019t speak much English. He has since discovered his American father and has been accepted by the family in Ohio or wherever. Still doesn\u2019t speak much English.

            "answer": "Yes, I still have certain German habits, customs that, the way I was brought up is, emphasizes deferred gratification. Maybe fewer white lies, maybe too much adherence to telling the truth, even when it\u2019s, when it shouldn\u2019t be told. Now my wife taught me an awful lot and certainly has Americanized me. I think that\u2019s as far as I can go."

            "answer": "I have for the past dozen years or so longer than that. My wife. Been very active in doing family history, genealogy. My wife teased me. Until I started compiling her family history which is quite limited of course because eastern resources are. But I discovered a cousin of hers who had fled the Soviet Union, lived in Germany. I corresponded with that cousin who said oh, you Sherry have an uncle in Leningrad, whereupon we took a Baltic cruise. First lined up a local recent immigrant who made a phone call to the uncle in Leningrad. And basically arranged that we would meet in Leningrad when our ship stopped there. The uncle imported a cousin of Sherry\u2019s who lived in Moscow. A retired teacher of English who had never been in an English speaking country to serve as interpreter. In short my wife has forgiven me my interest in families. I\u2019m being glib of course. Why did I engage in what is clearly unequivocally Jewish family history. I learned a whole lot about my ancestors, who spoke probably western Yiddish who are clearly were observant. I had a great grandfather who was a either a parnas [ph] or but it\u2019s all historical interest. It doesn\u2019t do anything for me. In the emotional Jewish sense. I am ethnically Jewish as non-observant as can be. The only time I go to a synagogue 1s for weddings or funerals. Hans has forgiven me but clearly that\u2019s it."

I walked the stations of the cross in Jerusalem because the fellow passengers were Protestants. My wife had a non-cousin in Haifa I think and visited him. My wife had a much more traditional Jewish upbringing. She belonged to B\u2019Nai Brith youth and no Hillel youth, but I don\u2019t want to put words in her mouth but I think she kind of saw marrying me as a liberating experience. Part of it may of course have been simply loyalty to a marriage and I don't know. But she certainly adjusted more to my way of life and thinking than I adjusted to hers."

Because I pursue that kind of stuff. And I tipped off a cousin in Connecticut who collected far more than I did but she had wealthier relatives. And tipped off a cousin in Florida who failed to follow through. It has been ongoing but nobody in my immediate family ever collected monthly payment. No these were always rather small lump sums."

Sometimes I even worry that the, maybe going too far in outgoing any kind of a protest but that\u2019s their problem, not mine. Yes, the Germans have learned their lesson I think. Who else is supposed to have learned? The Austrians certainly not. They\u2019re opportunists. I happen to have Austrian Jewish neighbors. He was much younger than I was when they came here. He\u2019s fully, far more Americanized than Iam. And we sometimes make our unkind remarks about Austrian opportunism. I assume you\u2019re familiar with the story.

It was a very meaningful experience. I don\u2019t want to call it an emotional experience but it and I don\u2019t want to call it vengeance either. But I was clear what the war was about and I was glad to be doing it. Something towards it. I am amazed with hindsight and I was in a small outfit, 160 men. How fully accepted I was.

First of all it certainly enhanced my vocabulary to do de-Nazification questionnaires you had to enlarge your vocabulary and your view of the world. I also, it also refreshed my memories. One reason why I am probably better able to remember things during an interview like this than others 1s because I had a refresher course at age 20, 21 which living in an environment that evoked all kinds of things that \u2019d forgotten or would have forgotten.

But in terms of people that I knew personally, there was a classmate of my father\u2019s who\u2019s also a distant relative who committed suicide in Los Angeles because he found out that his nieces and nephews had been deported.

            "answer": "Well as I told you, Herman came out of a PW cage. This was September 1945. The war ended in May. We explored the neighborhood together and we did it amicably, successfully and nostalgically. He told me that his, he was a lieutenant. His company commander who was a https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with George Arnstein 52 October 23, 2011 captain was a guy who lived across the street, and he was four years older than we were. And he was killed. He, period, paragraph. My wife and I went back and visited Herman and his wife. This must have been my wife died 14 years ago so I tend to time everything before and after. This must have been 18, 20 years ago. And it was a very good visit. He and his wife and my wife and I took a trip out in the country and we visited a ruined castle on a mountaintop because Herman and I had bicycled there in a one day trip. And we were all staggered that we had managed to do that at the age of 12, 13. But these are selective. When I visited, oh the city of Stuttgart had a program to invite its former citizens. My wife was by then too ill to travel and so my sister and I and her husband went whenever. And I was interviewed and there was a story in the newspaper with my picture, whereupon there promptly was a phone call from a former classmate in the hotel who\u2019d like to get together with me. Well he was one of those I did not wish to get reacquainted with. He was the cousin of one of the guys who had followed me during the soccer game. Now blood 1s thicker than water. He was a cousin so maybe he was less enthusiastic and less nasty but I chose not to tell him off, not to do anything. I just not to get reacquainted. Does that illustrate. In 1945 probably during that same visit with Herman, I remember walking past the house where the teacher lived who had made that precipitating remark and there was the doorbell and there was his name. Should I break his goddamn windows. No. I chose to ignore him. So I don\u2019t remember exactly what your question was but my feelings are very clearly no, I do not want to exact revenge. I merely want to take advantage of whatever present memories I have."
