He then helped to bring the rest of his family. He and my grandmother Mirel, M-i-r-e-I had seven children. My father was the sixth child of that family. And my father\u2019s name is Simche, S-i-m-c-h-e Weber. They changed his name also to Lakritz. He was also known as Simon Weber, or Simon Lakritz.

They both immigrated to Germany and a-arrived and lived in different city, my father in Kiel, my mother in Cologne. I was the first of three children born of my parents. I was born, as I said, on June 1, 1934 in Kiel. After th -- me was my sister Rosa, R-o-s-a Weber, and her name also was subsequently changed to Lakritz. She was born on July 28, 1935 in Kiel, and she died I think the first or second day of her -- her first day of her life. She is the only member of the family who 1s buried in Kiel, who has in fact a burial place, other than my mother in the United States. My brother then followed and he was born on September the second 1936 and he was born also in the city of Kiel. That is the extent of my immediate family. I will go into the extended family when I\u2019m asked."

            "question": "Okay. Tell me a little bit about your parents. What did your father do, what kind of work did he do?",
            "answer": "My father worked for his father. My grandfather, Artur, otherwise known as Arthur Weber, had established a business in the city of Kiel. From what I understand -- I don\u2019t really know the whole nature of it but at -- at -- after the f - end of the first World War, when he arrived -- whenever he arrived in -- in Kiel, I\u2019m not sure when, he established a -- a wholesale business, and I believe initially it was of material after the war. In any event, he then changed that business to basically a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Lakritz , April 3, 2008 business of collecting during the -- th-the beginning of the Nazi regime, of collecting items that the German economy needed; raw material, reusable material. And so he became a wholesaler of schmatter and of all types of metal and all kinds o-of things that they could recycle. And he, during the time when Jews couldn\u2019t find employment, he employed many, many Jews of Kiel in this business, and they would go through the streets of Kiel with a handcart and call out something. And I\u2019m -- I\u2019m relating basically what I -- what I understand. And these people would buy the used material that was recyclable, that Germany needed and then they would sell it to my grandfather, my grandfather was their employer and I guess he was the contributor to the livelihood of many, many Jews who also came from Galicia and -- like he had. And they formed a community in Kiel, which is important to understand, I mean the history of my family, which is recorded in Kiel and in books and in theses. His relationship to the other Jews, and to his own kind of Jews who immigrated to Germany is important. He was a very devout Jew. A Hassidic Jew, and -- as I think most of them were when they moved to Galicia, from Galicia to Germany. And he was a member of the one synagogue in -- in -- in -- in Kiel. And as a devoted and daily religious man such as my father was also, he belonged to that synagogue. But the Jews of Germany who were integrated Jews, and my gr-grandfather kind of Jews, clashed. And they clashed culturally, they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Alfred Lakritz : April 3, 2008 clashed religiously in their dress, in their manner, in their form of employment, economically, in -- in -- in all the other way. So those two groups in Kiel, separated. And my grandfather, having a compound property an-and -- and a -- and a big warehouse, and it was a big business, anyway, he created his own synagogue, and I take pride in the father -- in the fact that my grandfather, whenever I\u2019ve told that story, 1s the only person that I know who had his own synagogue and his own congregation. And that synagogue, and the photograph of his synagogue 1s reproduced in the books -- in the history books, published by the state where I was born and by the city of Kiel, and I was given the books, an-and -- and the photograph of that particular synagogue is repeated over and over, even in the museum of -- of Kiel and -- which is outside the -- Kiel. And it is a example, I suppose of that there were Jews, and that there was an existence. Anyway, tha -- I want to lead up to why this is significant in my family, because I come from these people. They are ordinary people, they are very religious people, they are very good people. They are very honest people, hardworking people, family people, loving people. And all of these people were killed during the Holocaust. Thirty-one members of my father immediate -- im-immediate I\u2019m -- I\u2019m speaking now, members of my father\u2019s family were killed in the co -- various concentration camps of the Nazis. All of that is verified by documents that I have collected. And I\u2019m This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I have all of their names and birthdates and places of where they were killed, and all those children but- seven of those children, survived. Seven children of this large family survived the war. And one of the survivor had been interned in Auschwitz. He -- he is the only one who survived the concentration camp of -- of all of my immediate cousins. All of my cousins otherwise, but the other -- my brother and I and I think four, survived. And the survival of these other cousins is interesting. Two or three of them went from Kiel o-or Cologne, or wherever they were living, right now I don\u2019t recall, and they went on the Kindertransport to England, okay? Of those, one, Max Wiedman, who is my -- also my first cousin, served in the British army and then in the Intelligence, because he spoke, of course, very well the language of Germany. He served in Germany an -- as a -- an Intelligence officer after the war an-and after- before the [indecipherable].

Now, one of my cousins grew up in Cologne, and she was sent by her parents to Palestine in 1937. She -- I think her name is Ruth, right now. She became one of the early kibbutzim in then Palestine. She became a labor leader. She was extremely active in -- 1n politics in -- 1n -- in -- and in the kibbutz movement in -- in Palestine. And she, like the son of the Auschwitz survivor, and Max Weidman who was in England, us four were the surviving children of this family, other than my brother. But those four reunited in Kiel when we invited by the city of Kiel and by the state of where -- which we were born, to return. So those four, okay. The only one of the surviving children who were born in Kiel who were not killed, was my brother Herbert and he chose not to accept the invitation and not to go to Germany, to our birthplace.

Tough part is coming. One of the things that hurts I think the most about what happened to my family, and I\u2019m sure many families, 1s that they were totally, completely innocent, because they were totally good people. And the injustice of what happens to my family, as it is to thousands and maybe millions of others, who were just as innocent, just as good, just as nice, is what makes, in my view, the Holocaust such a monstrous crime. Now, my parents as I said, right, my father worked directly for his father. A good son, a loving son. His parents, my grandparents were wonderful, loving, religious, good people. My father and mother were tremendously good people. And they didn\u2019t do anything -- and I have to say this at the beginning -- anything to deserve anything of what happened to them.

They all understood that the German government, the German rulers had decided to -- because they came and arrested all these people, right, and said all you can do is take whatever, yo-you know, you can carry it in hand. You\u2019re leaving everything behind, right? You\u2019re abandoning everything, we\u2019re transporting you, we\u2019re shipping you back to where you belong in Poland. And they were crying.

And I\u2019m sure maybe my father was crying. And I -- this was a real shock to me, yes. And later I-I was told -- of course I didn\u2019t understand anything that was going on -- later on I was told by my mother -- not then, of course, years later, that that day Poland had had it. It did not want to accept any more Jews being transported or expelled, you know, from Germany into their country for whatever reasons they decided to do that. And our train, as far as my mother is concerned, our train was the train that was not allowed into Germany and it was sent back. So we were sent back to Kiel.

Okay, so in my family, what happened 1s, I believe that early 1n this ballgame, the persecution of Jews was directed against my family as it was against others, and I will tell you why. For some reason my mother became very concern about their -- the future. For herself and for her children and for her husband. So she wrote -- I had a great heeha -- a great-uncle, her uncle, Uncle Max Fass, who lived in Oakland, California. And he had become a very successful businessman. And she wrote to him, and I have one of her letters that she wrote to him, asking him to sponsor us to immigrate to the United States. His application was approved, visas and -- and our permission to enter the United States was approved in 1935. He had paid for the transportation with the Hamburg America line. We had everything.

So then they demanded proof that his parents were civilly married and they had not been, apparently. So what they did is this: they demanded of my grandfather that he sign an affidavit, and I have a copy of it. I have the original an -- I mean, I have a -- a -- a -- a copy of it. And in that affidavit, okay I cannot describe totally every word, but what I understand from this affidavit that he was forced to sign, he was forced to say that my father was his bastard child. Remember, this was the sixth child of his wife and himself, right? This is a devout, you know, couple. My -- my grandmother didn\u2019t even have her -- you know, she followed the -- the Jewish Orthodox custom of wearing, you know, a wig. I mean, this is about as gross a monstrosity, you know, other than -- to debase human being, right.

So I went to the consulate, I was received with extreme courtesy, both by the legal officer and the vice-consul. Both were extremely nice to me, I -- and I explained to them who -- of course, who I was, an-and what my interest was, you know, and as a lawyer, you know, practicing in Los Angeles, they were extremely professionally connected to me. They were connected also intellectually, I mean, they -- you know, and they were young, you know, people, as I was. And so our discussions were very frank.

And I now am in this milieu, in this -- and how these people deal with the world as it\u2019s evolving out of their control, and the minimal amount of their choice, or the choices that they make either actively or passively, with regard to people like me, is part of the reflection of their religious education, their family education, right, and their laws.

In other words, if there is no God, if there 1s no religion, obviously then there\u2019s no commitment, there is no covenant, there is no obligation, right, and religion is a farce. But if there 1s, why did this happen to us, you know? And so this is a dialog, a philosophical question which has to be posed, right, and maybe it has no answer, and that\u2019s okay. Nor is there proof that there is a God. But the point 1s, all of these things intersect, intellectually, morally, religiously, philosophically, in my life. And then what happens?

Okay, now, this is a very, very, very interesting and traumatic episode in my life. The Berny family owned a lot, an empty lot across from the schoolhouse. And they gave my father the task, the job to raise a garden for them in this lot. And I remember going up to him and bringing him lunch, and I remember him kissing me. He was all sweaty and had beard and all of that. Oh, that re -- that reminds me. I remember also the city of Marmande had given us a garden.

I remember the other boys -- other boys, they grabbed me and they tied me or something to the fence and they said that I was the Christ killer and that they wanted to punish me or whatever it 1s, and -- I told this story also to this French historian and she reported it in her book, and I am sure this happened. That\u2019s why she reported it in her book. That in this environment of Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, you have this play of attitudes of people. Here is this family being helped and sheltered, allowed to survive, when nobody was allowed to give work to the refugee Jews, and yet they did. And at the same time, the children of others of the age of six and seven, equal to me, target me as a Christ killer. And obviously they didn\u2019t come up on this on their own. Obviously this was taught to them. Obviously this underlines what was happening and the crimes of the Catholic church are now descended on me. And they descend on my father, because what follows, right, is a choice made by French police, and French government and French -- and I have that whole testimony laying around that I will tell, about one of the men who had the power and didn\u2019t exercise it to save my father\u2019s life, but who confessed to me that if he had known that the chief of police, his friend, right, he was the exec -- my friend Guyaux, right?

I gave him a plaque as I gave to others. And this man said to me -- admitted something to me, and he says, there\u2019s nothing they can do to me any more, I\u2019m too old, but I could have saved your father\u2019s life. And if you blew a bomb right there in front of me, I -- I don\u2019t think -- among the many, many shocks that I\u2019ve had in life, this was one. And he -- and he explained to me why. He said to me, when they ordered the arrest of your father, and I participated in the arrest -- cause he was the chief officer of the city of Marmande, and Saint Pardoux is within the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the power and the sphere -- the space -- the jurisdictional surrounding of Marmande, under its jurisdiction. He said, I could have saved him, but I didn\u2019t know that the police, the chief of police, was of the same mind as I, that we didn\u2019t want this killing of innocent Jews. We didn\u2019t want to make the choice between refugee Jews and French-born Jews. But I didn\u2019t know that, and he didn\u2019t know I could trust him, and I didn\u2019t know I could trust him. And so when your father was ordered to be arrested in March 1942, he was arrested, obviously, with the consent and the cooperation of the city of Kiel, and the police of Kiel and of him."

So he didn\u2019t become a full fledged priest or monk, or you know. He chose not to. So when we revisited one time, my wife and I, the first time we went there, I took my children, and I couldn\u2019t enter the building, that chicken coop, it was locked and there was nobody around, you know. But another time we came back and they were there, the Bernys. And so they -- he took me around. And he said to me, you were an extraordinary child. He says, you learned the patois, which is the local French. You learned it in no time at all, you could speak it as well as anybody. And he says, you used to sit on my lap and I would read you stories, you know. He says, I was amazed that you could speak French, you know, you could speak the patois, and obviously I understood my parents who spoke German. And they were learning, you know, French too. And so, I guess he really liked me, and well, a lot of people, you know, a-as a child that I was liked. But above all, my brother was liked more.

And I became obsessed that he should never be separated from me for a moment, because I was afraid of what was going to happen. If he was separated they may take him away from me, an-and no way. So, I succeeded in most terms, but there was a period of time when he was housed someplace and I was housed in another one, but that became an obsession with me, that I would go into freaky periods if they suggested anything that I should be separated from my brother, or my brother should be separated from me.

But I also remember that by that time I was a bed wetter and boys, other boys were making fun of me and they were trying to get me to stop and -- and the way they hope was they wouldn\u2019t allow me to change my bed, and so every night I had to sleep in a bed that was full of, to put it in plain vernacular, piss, right.

The fact that my parents, right, decided that we should not come home, and that strangers had a better chance to save us than they did, cause they were helpless.

And you will hear, as we go along that that history goes to today. That there is a memorial now in Kiel, Germany, where there was no memorial, only because of me. Because when I visited Germany, I asked them, you know, I -- the only memorial that you have that remains, of the presence, and the persecution of Jews in Kiel is a little marker on the side of the curb of the street where the synagogue was burned, the main synagogue of Kiel. Other than that they had no memorial to the Jews or to the -- to the concentration camp, or to the - the whole Holocaust, nothing. So when I went there, I asked them, I will pay for it.

You said you had no communication in the beginning even, from your parents.",
            "answer": "Okay, there are many things I remember about that period. It\u2019s difficult for me to recall any particular conversation I had with my brother. It 1s not difficult for me to recall a number of events that I remember very specifically. The one thing I expressed earlier, and I say it again because it helps to explain; I had an obsession and fear, absolute fear, that I would be separated from my brother and he from me. I mean, this was an absolute fear. And obviously that fear is clearly tempered and explained by the fact that we were suddenly separated from our parents, right, without any comprehension or explanation by anybody. So now what happens in this episode to my brother and I for two and a half years 1s that we are in the company of other Jewish children, so they are contemporaries. Some are older, right, many years older, cause we\u2019re very little, and some of them are about our age, and we play and -- and -- and do things like little children.

And one of the points that I tried to find, I tried to find where I loo -- I was hidden in the upper plateau of a big city called Evian, on the lake -- on the shore of the lake Geneva. And so one of them was this big house in -- in -- which is in one of the pictures, and I wanted to find this place. Now anyway, so one of those weekends we went someplace else, and this very nice woman w -- we had to find lodging, we had no reservation, so she offered us a room in -- in her big house, whatever it was, a hostel and so on. And some story about that her son -- I was looking to locate this place and that her son might know something, you understand, that he was cognizant of the history and th -- and th-the -- during the wartime and the resistance that occurred there and the -- the Jews. And so we went to her place, and she showed us the room, and it was terrible. Anyway, so we didn\u2019t want to stay there.

We knew that we weren\u2019t allowed to go out and play, we were not allowed to do anything in the exterior, everything was done in the interior.

So I think they separated us there. In other place before that we were all with Jewish children, so it didn\u2019t matter.

I mean, there\u2019s no way you could move. So my mother one time told me about that they had to go somewhere, all right, even at the risk of their lives, but 1t was that important.

I said earlier that in my understanding of it, they were put there for easy picking, all right, by the French police. And the whole system was geared around keeping them there, locked in, with no escape and no means of escape. So now you can understand this couple, right. Now they say, oh my God, we have sent our children away and they\u2019re going to come arrest us. Now, okay, then comes the second judgment, well better they stay there in the protection of this organization then, cause we are trapped. We cannot escape, right.

Well, they had hidden her for th -- a lot of that two and a half year period. And I went to publicly thank this family that I visited many, many, many times.

Anyway, I told these newsmen this, and -- and newspaper men and they considered that to be what I consider it, th -- not fully appreciating the content. Anyway, so shortly after that, by this Jewish organization we were taken and reunited with my mother. And I remember my mother there on the same platform of the same railroad station, standing just about exactly the same spot that I last saw her, say two and a half years before, with her close friend that she developed, this Madame Rozinsky, and her son, who became my close friend. And they were Jews of -- from Alsace-Lorraine and they were spared. They were spared in the town of ma -- Marmande, and two doors down was another Jewish family by the name of Alco, all of these were our friends after the war, and they were spared because they were French born.

She has no idea if her children are alive or dead, except th-there are a few photographs that are given to her. And she, of course, knows nothing of what happened to her husband.

She\u2019s a seamstress, she is known by the farming families, you know, who use her. And one day she 1s asked by this Italian farmer\u2019s family, the Ros family, R-o-s to make a wedding dress for their one -- their second oldest daughter. So my mother makes this wedding dress for her, and she did, I guess, a reasonably good job. Then they ask her to make the suit for the groom. So she makes that. And from then on they are totally connected, and they become her protectors. So, they take her away, she is all alone, right, obviously a woman in tremendous pain and they give her a family and a home and a place. So this is two people who had immigrated from Italy when things were bad in northern Italy in the early 30\u2019s. And they became tenant farmers in -- in the southwest of France at a chateau called LeCook, and -- by a woman who was Madame deFerrier, a noble lady of -- not noble in act, of course she was noble in act, but her name was of the nobility. And the tenant farmers that they have 1s this family, Ros. And this couple, the Ros\u2019 are two magnificent -- magnificent human beings. They are farmers with a little education. They have six or seven children, right now I\u2019m not counting them, and they have this farm. And so they take her in and from time to time, you know, one of their son, you know transports my mother by bicycle to their farm, which is up on this hill, at the mas dejeuner.

So I guess in the sense they consoled themselves because they have some connect in that sense. Anyway, she spends a lot of time there, and they even hide her. One time I was taken through when I returned. When I was a child growing up there I wasn\u2019t interested in any of this, but when I returned with my wife and -- and children to LeCook, LeCook had been sold to a German couple, but they were -- they allowed us to come and visit that site. And I was then taken through the chateau, as I had been as a child, we used to play there all the time after the war. But I was shown a room in this chateau that had a secret wall, and my mother was hidden in that wall. So when police came to LeCook to check what\u2019s what, and so forth, so forth, they would hide her in this wall, you know, which was a fake wall. So, in my family so many things happened that happened to other Jews in other places and so on, even that happened. Anyway, these wonderful people kept her, nourished her, gave her support, moral and physical in that sense and helped her over this period. A photograph that I have of my mother shows her extreme pain. And she is in one picture shown, that\u2019s all I have, when she is with her sewing machine [indecipherable].

He says, I have the information that you need. So I said, yeah? He says, I\u2019m going to bring it to you. In a little while he came back with these two gigantic books, and he says, there 1s what happened to your family. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I open the book and it\u2019s called Gedanta volume one and two, the collection of the Jews of West Germany killed by the Nazis as reported and recorded by the Nazi -- I mean, post-war by -- and in this book I looked under Lakritz and I don\u2019t find my father.

How in the world they restored to him his name of Weber as a memorial to him is -- I -- I totally without any comprehension. How they went through the records and restored to him his name, is unbelievable. So the connection to my pursuit of my name, my identity, my roots, here it is confirmed in the Gedanta book, handed to me in the Yad Vashem.

I and my brother were allowed with nothing, not even speaking the language, but at the end of three years of residence in this country, we were admitted to the University of California at Berkeley, the most pra -- predominant public institution in the world, right, and certainly predominant against an -- a-at that time against any university in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We were treated totally equally, fairly, justly. So in every sense the United States gave to -- every opportunity to us. We owe every bit of gratitude, you know, and thanks to the United States. I mean, look, we came here with nothing, with hope. And this beautiful land, this beautiful country, right, gave us every opportunity. But we had to earn it. And we lived through three years of high school without tutors, without aid, without assistance. We had to earn it. We earned it. And you know what, the rest of the way also we earned, without assistance, without help, right. This is a sink or swim society. Well, we survived. Thank God. But it is only in this beautiful land, right, that gives opportunity to so many people, and has, and does, you know. So I make a judgment on this country. I condemn for what happened during the war and the immediate post-war period, and I praise this country for the period since then.

            "answer": "It a -- and I would tell you in truth two things. I was a very caring and -- and loving father. I am still, but I had my faults. And part of my fault was that I grew up with a certain amount of insecurity and that insecurity strived for security to counterbalance. And as I evolve there was a mixture as a person, both of striving for certain security in terms of at least economic security, and striving to deal with anger. Throughout my life I think that the experience of my childhood has affected my personality in the sense that I am much more explosive or ex -- more explosive than I would have been otherwise. I\u2019m easy to get upset and I am -- once I explode, which 1s -- doesn\u2019t happen often, cause I -- I control it, or 1t doesn\u2019t give me rise to anger. But when I do explode, I explode. And so I was a father who was loving and caring an-and -- and -- and they could depend on. But if something went wrong or something was not right, they would hear about it plenty. And so in that sense my children have a certain amount of resentment to when I wasn\u2019t as kind or as considerate or as sensitive or as -- you know, I -- as I should have been.

As a trial lawyer I also see it, you know, that I can easily fire up and take intellectual insult or attack, you understand, by somebody\u2019s -- I think -- and I do it -- once I am attacked in that way, I become very foraci -- ferocious, I become like the bulldog who -- at your ankle. And I will have the last word. So, yes, in one sense, you understand, I have this anger. One thing that has helped me, truly, is many years ago I started to write some of my history, some of my memories, and that became a -- like a psychological therapy for me, in many ways. To recount for myself -- this is strictly, you know, me, some of these events, some of these experiences, some of those feelings, you know, that I have. And part of retelling and reminding myself and crying along the story, I think has helped me to -- to reconcile myself with the injustices that happened to my family.

And after 47 years of -- as a lawyer, continuous practice of law in the state of California, I think I have done that with honor and -- so the aftereffect of the experience of the war is I haven\u2019t gone out and -- and -- and get a gun and shoot the Nazis or the Germans. I have not taken retaliation against them or others. I have accepted the fate that we had, never to forgive, never to forget. And that\u2019s an absolute. And I remember having lunch with this nun who was the as -- who was the assistant of the Cardinal Mahoney, the guy who is the Cardinal of all of southern California, one of the preeminent Cardinals in this country, and they had selected me for their -- I was the poster child for the 2000 -- the year 2000 of the reunification, or the year redemption between the Catholics and the Jews. And they had one edition that was devoted, and I was the centerfold story, in full color, in full everything. And a -- after it was done, she came and visited me in my office and we went to lunch together, and I expressed some of this feeling of my anger. My anger at what Pope Pius 12\" didn\u2019t do. What the Catholic archdi -- hierarchy did not do. The choices they made, and other Catholics eminence and nuns and -- and [indecipherable] you know.

And she says  and I said never to forgive, never to forget. She said, of course you should never forget. But she says, for your own soul, for yourself, you should forgive. So I have to say that between my own therapy in writing about it and talking about it and myself and -- and so forth, and the message that she gave to me, somehow I matured and so I could bring myself to go back and accept the invitation of the state I was born, the city where I was born, to visit. And I did it. I was very curious to see where I was born, where I come from, you know, this part of my trip, you know, to get my roots. And I got it and I was very happy. I had no resentment, on the contrary. The mayor was a perfect English speaking person, who had married an English girl. All the people there spoke English perfectly."

Right. They, you know, perished, you know, not by choice but by the hands of criminals and monsters. You know, whether they were the complicit one or the active one, but I\u2019m going to live.

Everything I have related in terms of factual event is confirmed by documents, records that I\u2019ve collected and I\u2019m sure others, by French historian, by German historian, by the work of -- the records of the German government, of the French government. And I want at least the future to understand that what I have stated 1s the truth.

I made a -- a decision to do it. The Catholic archdiocese of southern California helped me to locate this -- these -- these nuns, this order of -- turned out to be the order where Bernadette was a member, and they utilized the Catholic archives in France and elsewhere. Incidentally, that congregation was th-the congregation of nuns in La Soeur de la Charit\u00e9 [speaks French]. Well, I\u2019m sure nobody will translate that properly. Anyway, they have acknowledged my -- my -- my being hidden by them. They have included me in their -- in their archive. Now, everything I have said, all right, the arrest and -- and detention and death of my father is recorded by the French government. It is recorded by the German government. It 1s attested to by [indecipherable] in his research, including the very shipment that he was in, and his death, ultimate death in -- in Majdanek, by Lublin. The fact that I recited, that I was honored by the Catholic archdiocese to be their poster child, right, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was published in their distributed publication called, \u201cThe Tidings\u201d, and this was published in January 2001, because of the second Vatican and because of Pope pi -- Pope Pius -- John Paul th-the -- the -- the second. I have included m-many of the pages of the -- the 1 -- the historical research done by the French historian that I referred to in -- of the Jews of ther -- Lot-et-Garonne, which confirms that what happened to my parents an-and to me. The German state where I was born, not only did acknowledge what happened to us, but they also acknowledge the -- the death of my grandfather, my paternal grandfather and the - the -- the last of my uncles, where they were sent and they were killed, at Riga. And the memorial is there, they are listed 1-in the deaths of that camp, right, and I was sent all that documentation and th-the -- the efforts that they -- they are -- the city of Kiel is one of the sponsor of that particular monument and maintenance, in perpetuity they told me. As I said, the city of Kiel, at my request created finally, a memorial to the Jews which basically I have to say that all of these efforts, throughout, that what\u2019s happened in Kiel has centered basically on my family, because the museum in Kiel is center -- as I said, of -- of memorial and photos and so forth, which ha-has my -- my cousins, my family in it. So, I have to say that my family is honored. It\u2019s sad to have that as an inheritance, but we don\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. We move forward, we prevail, all right. We -- we meet the challenges, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

So in what you ask, you know, the question of how did you emotionally, as I understand, I mean, cope with different thing? Well, I'll give you the proof. The proof of the pudding is what is the bottom of the balance sheet, right. What is it that you did with your life? What is it that your brother did? What is it your mother did? Well, Pll tell you what my mother did. She sacrificed everything for her two sons. She worked like hell. Every day she would travel, you understand, by the bus, you know, from Oakland to San Francisco. Every day of her life, right, until she retired. Every day she worked to earn enough money, right, so we could go to school, you know? Not depend on -- on charity, on poverty, or anything, you know. We -- she did it. Now sure, we had a little bit of help from my inheritance, we had a little help that was given to her 1n-in -- in some reparation, you know, by the German government. Some by a pension of France, right, cause they were ab absolutely guilty of complicity, you know, to the murder of my father. I mean, that\u2019s absolute. I condemn them as total accomplices, okay. The fact that my father\u2019s name is on the memorial of the dead in my town, right, the only Jew that is so honored, you know, 1-1s -- 1s a -- 1s -- 1s a proof of the fact that some French people recognized the enormity of their complicity. But to some degree, we have to understand, you know, they had limited choices. They could only act at the peril of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, you know, in this whole ballgame, right, who are the only real, real monster? Of course, it\u2019s the German. This educated, right, most advanced culture of all became induced and seduced by these -- these -- these monsters. So they\u2019re all accomplices, they\u2019re all murderers. Under the laws the way we have it in the United States, if you are an accomplice before the fact or after the fact to a murder, you are guilty of murder. They are guilty of murder, period. All of them. That\u2019s it. Now, again, the -- the -- the importance of my statement here is that there is balance. And those who survived, some of them have survived that they can see, still see the evil and the dark of what happened, and yet live a beautiful life, without forgiving, without forgetting. I will never forget the murderers of my father. Never forget the pain and suffering they inflicted on my mother. And it would be a dishonor to me or anybody who lived through what I lived through, not to honor their mother and father, or their relatives, right, for their horrible, horrible death, you know. And that is the legacy. And I ask myself, why was I allowed to live? You know, why was I spared? Well, I believe this is one of the reasons. This collection of work, my testimony here, right. I didn\u2019t give it earlier because I didn\u2019t have all the documents that I wanted, right. Now I have it. Now I give it, and I give my judgments, too. I answer your inquiry, but I\u2019m willing to give it to you in a sense of saying I condemn what should be condemned. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The United States of America, to its credit, has learned from the serious, horrible injustices that were done to the Jews of Europe. And in its greatness and kindness and generosity, as was true in the past but not to the Jew, they became very generous to others. And that 1s a credit, because in the United States, after they recognized what they had done wrong or been complicit with, they were among the first, if not the first to recognize the state of Israel. They are, and stood, often alone between 1945 and -- and now -- or \u00b048, to be more correct, and now, to stand and protect Israel, provide them arms and money and -- and support, politi -- many, many, many time the lone country, the lone voice. Many, many time France and England, right, who should have supported, right, Israel, they voted the other way or they remained silent. The United States of America, to its great credit, also grew up and learned. And the fact that we today even consider that a black could be president of the United States, or a woman become president of the United States finally, I think in great part is the lessons that were learned by the United States to the wrongs that they committed to the Jews. So the generosity of this country, and it is a generous country, I think in part, is a debt of repayment to what they didn\u2019t do to the Jews. But that doesn\u2019t diminish my love for this country."
