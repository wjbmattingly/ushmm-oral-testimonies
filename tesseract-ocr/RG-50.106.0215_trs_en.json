And my mother was widowed when she was 39 years old and never remarried. And she took over his business in Berlin and then lost it through the Nazi taking over of her insurance business.

            "question": "What did you do after school? Were you interested in sports? Did you have any hobbies?",
            "answer": "I was at my gymnasium, I was interested in sports. That was swimming and track which I participated in. I was never very good at it. No, I had what you call letters in it and so forth. But the one thing that I remember very, very closely is right across the street from us lived our physical ed teacher who was an officer in the SS, who took to me. I was the best marcher. You know when we marched and I also was the best saluter. And he was a very friendly to me. He lived right across the street. And every once in a while he wore his SS uniform. But I had absolutely no fear or any kind of, other than that he was one of my teachers and he was friendly with me. And I really didn\u2019t feel any kind of persecution or otherwise until I was told that you had to leave the Hohenzollern gymnasium. And I was very disappointed because it was a very good gymnasium. It was close to where we lived. And I had to go to the Jewish gymnasium, way across town and I bicycled. But this was a really relatively short time. What happened was after my father died in 1936, my mother took over his business. We lived happily in Berlin. In 1937 her first cousin who lived, from Kansas City. They came to Europe. They didn\u2019t come to Germany. They met in Marienbad in Czechoslovakia. My mother went down. She didn\u2019t take me along and I really don\u2019t know why because she sent me off to camp. And they met in Marienbad in 1937. It was her first cousin. Interestingly about her first cousin who emigrated to the United States before World War I as a young person. He had worked for my grandfather and somehow he had gotten into financial trouble. So my erandfather said get out of here. I\u2019ll pay you to go to the United States and sent him abroad in order to keep him out of trouble. He never forgot that what my grandfather had done for him. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 9 And therefore, they came to Germany, to Marienbad to Czechoslovakia. And met. It was sort of a family reunion. He and his wife and their son Jeff who was my second cousin came to Marienbad. And they made the decision that the following year I was to go to Kansas City for one year and my cousin Jeff was to come and stay with my mother for a year. Sort of be a family exchange. It developed during that following year he wasn\u2019t going to come but I was going to go for good. And I had an affidavit and I had a visa. My mother did not yet. She had, she had an affidavit from her cousin but she didn\u2019t have a visa yet. It hadn\u2019t come up yet. So I went by myself in 1938. She took me to Hamburg and put me onto the Manhattan ship and I went off as a year old to New York. Yeah, but going back to Berlin."

            "question": "Stay with Berlin.",
            "answer": "That so I really I should say something else about Berlin. I am sure that if my father had lived we would have all succumbed in the Holocaust because he felt he wasn\u2019t German. He had served in World War I. He had an Iron Cross, actually an Iron Cross that was bestowed belatedly by Hitler. So he was, this was never going to happen to us. We would have never left Berlin and we would have all succumbed if he had not passed away. So this is one of the, my personal history that I feel that the only way that we really survived is because he had passed away at an early age."

            "answer": "Only on one occasion and it was not really anti-Semitism. It was the week before I left. My mother had purchased for me a pair of long trousers, knowing that in the United States young boys wore knickers but also long trousers. And I had them on, was right across the street from where we lived and where I was accosted by four or five young boys who didn\u2019t like what I was wearing. Whether I was Jewish or not I have no idea. And they beat me up. And I came home and my mother, in her usual way, said this did you good so you had this experience of being beat up so you know what will happen to you if you know, things like this. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 10 And that was the only occasion that I personally felt it was, that I had any kind of bad experience in this.

Hitler came aboard and I certainly was conscious about him. I don\u2019t remember that there were any things. Sorry. I don\u2019t remember that there were any things that happened to us personally because in any way. I heard about him pretty early but it was one of those things that my father said this doesn\u2019t concern us. We\u2019re Germans. He\u2019s not an important figure. Of course and actually his, while he was alive, his business was fine. I mean he had no problems at all. This was 19, between 1933 and 1936. He died in 1936. So I really had no bad experiences.

And her older brother who was a physician was the hardest hit by this because he lost his father, his brother and his, and his brother in law all in one year. And that I remember, very hard. And they all departed at the time when I left. My mother was the only one who was left by herself. And what happened on Kristallnacht which was after, two weeks after I left.

And I was in Camp Sibert in Alabama in chemical warfare which meant you did everything in basic training with the, as the infantry does except with gas masks on. You walked, jumped, ran with gas masks on. Then I guess the army decided that there wasn\u2019t going to be any chemical warfare.in this war. So they closed the camp and I was sent to New Orleans to be in a port battalion as a stevedore, loading and unloading ships, army ships. And I was doing this and I said I\u2019ve got to get out of here. And so I applied for training, STAP, advanced specialized training program as a soldier. I was a private. And I was accepted but you had to have some kind of security clearance and they came to me says you can\u2019t go to ASTP, you\u2019re an enemy alien. So they assigned a, my sergeant you know who supervised me and you know he said you will go down to New Orleans to the district court and you will be sworn in as a citizen. You will be made a citizen. But you have to have a witness who has known you for three years to do this. And of course I knew https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 25 nobody. My sergeant well I\u2019ve known him for three years. He\u2019s known me for three weeks. And we went, he says I swear that I\u2019ve known him. I\u2019m a witness so he could get a day off that way and we went into the city of New Orleans and I was sworn in as an American citizen on that day."

And it was a, I was used to army life by that time. Camp Ritchie was different. It was a camp close to Washington where your training was not six days a week and one day off. It was seven days a week and the eighth day off which was called ban day because the commanding general of Camp Ritchie was a brigadier general by the name of Banfield. So you worked six, seven days and got the eighth day off. And the course I think was eight weeks long. It was also a sort of a peculiar camp because many of the soldiers there were privileged kids of senators and congressmen and people in the administration and on weekends very often, on ban day, there were limousines coming up to take sons and daughters. There were some very fancy people who were soldiers there. The permanent staff at Camp Ritchie were primarily, they were you know not, they were not German specialists or anything. They were not \u2014 there were a lot of refugee children. I mean youngsters at Camp Ritchie.

They were the enemy. They were all Italian speaking kids. Italian Americans. The German speakers, there was a permanent staff there. And the man in charge, master sergeant, Manmar Hudeen [ph], a very well-known former wrestling champion was the master sergeant in charge of our barracks and so forth. His name was Manmar Hudeen. He was a huge guy and I do remember distinctly, he was a very nice person. And but his name was Manmar Hudeen. There was the, there were some pretty well known children of well-known people. In the camp. And I became, I just cannot remember him now, a well-known writer, author who later on in late life was in East Germany. He defected to East Germany. I will be able to look it up but I just don\u2019t remember it now. But we were, and it was a pretty fancy kind of a camp. I mean being a private in the army in Camp Ritchie, I was very impressed. And our training consisted, our intelligence training, consisted of fighting the battle of Gettysburg from the intelligence point of view. And we were taken out at night and put on trucks and we were taken into the Gettys \u2014 we were at Camp Ritchie is you know, in the Gettysburg area. And they let us out of the trucks and said find yourself back to Camp Ritchie within the next three hours. This is your compass. Well we all had learned by that time from other kids, you went to the next farm, rang the door. Farmer would, saying we\u2019re from Camp Ritchie. What campus, what direction should I take. They said take as with so and so and you will find your way back. Now they would ask what https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 27 language are you in.

The fact that I had a German background really came only into play because I was in Camp Ritchie and I spoke German. I had no feeling at all of having been a German citizen at one time. Forgotten that you know. I mean I was, I felt absolutely and thoroughly as an American, just like any other American. And by that time I probably didn\u2019t have much of an accent anymore. Maybe slightly. But which I still have. But or we, which has come back in my old age. I mean I notice it myself being sort of a linguist that Ihave. My, actually my accent sort of returns slightly now. Yeah. But I had actually no feeling of ever having been a German you know at that time. I was so Americanized from Kansas City, Middle Western kid. And psychologically the other thing being going to Kansas City immediately in the Middle West I was thrown into an American Middle Western family. There were no other German refugees around me. I had to learn English and I was, I had nobody to speak German with. So I didn\u2019t and I you know only spoke English, learned to speak English. And I was if you, if I landed in New York and lived in New York among other refugees, I would have felt like Kissinger you know. With a German accent and so forth. I deliberately tried to lose my German accent because I didn\u2019t want to be, I wanted to be with you know integrated so to speak. And therefore I had really lost any contact with Germany. My mother, for just a year, you know a year and a half and then she left and she came to the United States. So my, I had absolutely no feeling or contact for having really been a German. I was thoroughly Americanized. And I never had anybody really to speak German with or to exper -- have related experiences with and I didn\u2019t know anybody who \u2014 because I was thoroughly Americanized and my family was American. My uncle was the only one who spoke German, well a little bit of German. And he was gone all day long. So I was, I was Americanized and I had no feeling, not being an American.

And we had seven days of nothing but physical training. Seven, eight hours a day of physical training. And only jumped from platforms. Learned how to jump from platforms. And the second week, five days, every day to jump out of an airplane. Locally. And they took us up in the airplanes and the US Army had purchased a number of farms which were the landing areas. And we were told that when we jumped we had to jump in that area because if we jumped across into another farm, they had to buy the farm or something like that. And so for five days, we jumped, one jump a day. And we were qualified. One of which was a night jump and that was scary. So we jumped.

They were open because they couldn\u2019t, they so you just and there was a lot of noise. And we were scared as hell. And we had been issued just before we left, new first aid.

We had been issued new first aid kits which had a vial of morphine in them because if you jumped and got hurt that you could inject yourself with morphine. We were flying towards Normandy at night, scared.

We had no food with us or anything with us because we were supposed to be there for eight or nine days. I mean we had a little bit of food with us. No equipment.

How many are in your unit? And things like that, just very simple questions. Because it was a very fluid situation. But we actually got taken out very quickly. And went back to England and then we waited. We were in England. I was in the Redding area in a camp until the Holland invasion, in September 17\" I believe. September 17\" was the invasion of Holland. And that was a more difficult jump because it was day time. And there were, the other thing I wanted to mention is we also had glider troops. The 101\u201c Airborne division had a glider regiment and I was actually assigned to the glider regiment but as a jumper. And the replacements that we got after combat and injured were all soldiers who were from the glider regiment, because the gliders were much more dangerous than jumping. You know and so people, you had to volunteer to be a jumper, https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 35 but to be a glider rider, you were assigned. So after the Normandy invasion all the survivors of glider volunteered to become paratroopers because 1t was so much more dangerous to be a glider rider. And so we went into Normandy, into Holland and we, the 101\u201c Airborne Division was situated around Eindhoven. The 82\" Division was Nijmagen and the Sixth British Paratroop division was across the river. I can\u2019t remember. And that was the occasion where the British were annihilated. And the reason they were annihilated is we were supposed to, three divisions were supposed to jump and maintain the road open for the second British army to move through and across the line and liberate Holland. What happened is Marshall Montgomery apparently just, they were so slow. And here we were holding the road open and the British came and they stopped and they had tea in the afternoon. They stopped, got off their tanks. And sat with us and had tea and then they never made it to, to Arnhem. Arnhem. They never made it and the British were annihilated across the river. The whole division was and it was, the reason was that Montgomery never came and did that. We were in Holland for 70 days. We were supposed to be there for ten days at the most and then again were to be removed. We stayed there for 70 days. And the big problem was food. Because we hadn\u2019t brought any food with us. And we literally lived off the land. And the land were apple orchards. This whole area were in that part around Eindhoven were apple orchards. And we lived off apples. And so did the local population because they didn\u2019t have anything much either. So what there was of farmers and people who were around, they couldn\u2019t give us anything. For once in a while, they got a chicken or something like that but we were there for 70 days and before we were taken out. And brought back to rest camp in France called near Rels [ph] called Mumalo le Grand [ph]. That was our camp, was a French, old French, French camp with actually straw mattresses still. And we were there briefly and then started to Bastogne to counterattack, the British counter attacked and we went to Bastogne, and were there throughout the siege of Bastogne. We went there on the 18\" of December, 17\" of December and then we were completely isolated and Eisenhower declared Bastogne the expendable to stay there and not give up. We were completely surrounded by Germans. And it was General Patton, the Third army decided he was not going to, what Eisenhower had determined to make us expendable. He decided that he was going to send in a tank battalion to rescue us. And that tank battalion was headed by Colonel Abrams who was later General Abrams, in Korea. And they came through with his tank https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 36 battalion and on Christmas morning reached us. And broke through the German \u2014 the Germans had us completely surrounded and we didn\u2019t take any prisoners there because we were going to be their prisoners. And my one claim to fame in the army was when they came to have a surrender, the 101 Airborne surrender. I was working on, I mean I was with my colonel by the name of Harper, I was a regimental commander and we were actually right across from division headquarters. And they sent, the Germans sent in a team to make a surrender. And what happened was the surrender, the team two officers and two enlisted men were held when they came across with the white flag. And they were held in an outpost. And brought in the letter to surrender and my colonel and I were with our division commander. At the time was, he was assistant division commander because General Taylor was in Washington at the time. I mean he was not there. And McAuliffe was the assistant division commander. And so they presented this surrender demand to the commander and General McAuliffe and I were standing by them. He said oh nuts, what am I going to tell them. And no idea of \u2014 he said oh nuts, what am I going to tell them. And Colonel Kennard, his chief of staff stood by him and said tell them just what you just said. He said what did I say. He said you said nuts. He said all right, ok, nuts. And he wrote it out nuts. And then he sent my colonel, Colonel Harper and me back to the surrender place with the German officers, two German officers waiting. And we went down there and handed them the slip which said nuts. And the German officers said in German, what 1s this?"

And on Christmas morning there was bright sunshine. And suddenly the C-47\" came over massively, throwing down medical supplies. Food. And everything, all of a sudden on Christmas morning. It was great. And then after a few days we were sent, we were liberate -- No, we were there for another week or so. And then we moved out of Bastogne and we moved by that time we were very much emaciated. I mean troop wise, we were one third of our strength. We moved over to the right and down the line on the west side of the line, we moved down. We saw no combat. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 37 Practically no combat. It was towards the end of the war. The last three weeks of the war. And we went, we moved down and ended up on the day that the war ended, on May 6 at Berchtesgaden. We actually took Berchtesgaden. There was nothing to take. And being still prisoner of war specialists we headed immediately for Hitler\u2019s, and we went up to the Berghof and then we wanted to get up to the Eagle\u2019s Nest and we found out that we were not the first. There was a French company that had preceded us and they had gone up to the Eagle\u2019s Nest and taken all kinds of furniture and equipment and thrown it down the elevator shaft that had been the elevator. So we had to crawl up there by foot to get to the Eagle\u2019s Nest. There was nothing there anymore. But they had managed to throw stuff down the elevator shaft so you couldn\u2019t use the elevator to the Eagle\u2019s Nest. That\u2019s the end of that story. And then we were there for about a month. Oh we ended up in the Berchtesgaden Hof which 1s the fancy hotel in Berchtesgaden. And we were there for I think four days. When we were kicked out of the Berchtesgaden Hof and all the high level POWs, the generals and the ministers that were captured around there were put into the Berchtesgaden Hof. This is where they held them as prisoners. And we were in a hotel across from the Berchtesgaden Hof which was a lovely sort of a country hotel with cabins, you know individual cabins. And we landed in that hotel and we gave the proprietor and the kitchen staff all of our K rations and everything we had and they provided us with food for a month."

I was able, because I had had enough points being in these various combat situation and having gotten by that time a Bronze star, and combat infantry badge. I had enough points to be one of the first to get out. So I was sent back to a camp near Paris, Le Desine [ph], a suburb of Paris and I was there for about a week and then was shipped home. And I was actually got home by December eighth. You know I was one of the first people in my own acquaintance to get out of the army and get back.

I think they had Kendall Hall School for Girls or something in Peterborough, New Hampshire. And I was admitted only for summer school. I was not admitted for the actual college at that time. So I went up there and don\u2019t think I distinguished myself academically. However, on the weekend before the fourth of July in some reason or other, the cooks of the school quit. Left. And left, the school was without a cook for the long weekend. For the Fourth weekend. So before they could go down to Boston to hire a new chefs for that weekend, I volunteered to cook for the school. And I think that is what got me into graduate school for the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 39 next year because they couldn\u2019t refuse my application. So I went to SIAS and at the first week in Washington, my wife Mimi had come down. She had been graduated from Carleton College. She had sort of a record there. She had a absolute A, four years of nothing but A\u2019s. She made Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year. And she was a valedictorian of her class. She had actually literally never had anything but an A as long as she was going to school, until graduate school and we had met and that\u2019s when she got her first B and she blamed me for that.

And I was trained for, paid $200 a month plus lunch which was very important for ten months and then I was assigned to go to Germany where they had three branches, primarily serving the military in Germany, primarily. Not completely. But they had three branches in Germany \u2014 in Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich. And I went there and Mimi and I had decided rather than getting married in Washington and then immediately being separated because there was no housing available, that we would wait, that I would go over there and I would find housing for us and then she would come over if we married and live happily ever after. I went to Stuttgart and most of my customers were military. And through them I got a place, an apartment to live and I was going to be able to have an apartment and so I told the bank that I was bringing my fianc\u00e9e over and they said oh no you can\u2019t get married for three years. I said what? Says yes, we want to be able to move you around to the other branches, you can\u2019t get married. And I walked out of the bank, not having enough money to get back to the United States. Fortunately the State Department was taking over from military government the administration in Germany. In other words, we were establishing an embassy for military government and they were hiring people on the spot and they preferred hiring people who had not been with military government. And so I was hired. Practically from one day to the next and they wanted to put me in finance and I didn\u2019t want to be in finance. I had been working for the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 40 bank and I didn\u2019t want to be in finance. So I was told that you don\u2019t want to be in finance. Would you like to be in cultural and press affairs. And having been journalistically trained and worked a little bit in journalism, I said yes. So they sent me out to Bad Hamburg which is a suburb of Frankfurt where there was to be the headquarters of the America house program in Germany. And the director of that program was a woman by the name of Patricia Van Douten and you go out and see her and maybe you\u2019ll get hired. So I went out there to and couldn\u2019t\u2019 see her but I was admitted to her deputy, Max Kimenthal. And as we started to talk I had no idea what an America House was. This was an America House program. I didn\u2019t even know what an America House was. But I was there to be interviewed. And he started talking to me and had a telephone call. And he said excuse me for five minutes. I\u2019m going to have to go out and see someone, but why don\u2019t you sit here at the coffee table and then whatever you have, read and I'll be back in five minutes. And there was a paper which said the future of the America House program in Germany by Patricia Van Douten. I said so I can read this and see what, I write it. He came back and he said if you were a director of an America House what would you want to do. And I just regurgitated what I was reading and he stopped me after about four or five minutes and he says just a moment Mr. Tuch, I want to \u2014 and he came back, went out and came back with Patricia Van Douten who was a formidable middle aged woman and would you start again Mr. Tuch. And I told the story and they hired me on the spot. I was sworn in that day. It took me two years to admit to Pat Van Douten what I had done. But that\u2019s the way I got into the foreign service. I was temporary and then after two years I took the exam and then I became a foreign service officer. The action by \u2014 or the same day that I was sworn in, another young man was also sworn in and his name was Natel, Wallace W. Natel. We were sworn in on the same day and were he was just a year or two older than I was. But we were given certain rank, very low rank, the equivalent of a second lieutenant type of thing. But he wasn\u2019t even given that because he had been a conscientious objector in the war and he had been a fire fighter, a paratroop fire fighter in Colorado. So a fellow paratrooper. So we immediately became close friends because we both were paratroopers. And we remained friends our whole life. And he was assigned to Darmstadt and I to Wiesbaden and after three months he went to Hanover and I went to Frankfurt and that\u2019s how he became. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 41"

I was there for five years. And the reason I was assigned to Frankfurt 1s that the then director of the Frankfurt America house who was a frustrated conductor of music, musician. With the budget for his information center he went out and hired himself an orchestra and performed a performance with himself as the conductor. He was fired the next day. Those were days when you know nothing was permanent. And I was assigned to replace him from Frankfurt. We were there for five years. And then I was in Washington and my job there became President Eisenhower had given his atoms for peace speech and that became a major program issue, atoms for peace. And I was assigned to build atoms for peace exhibits in Japan, in India and Portugal and I was doing that. And at the end of that we were starting to assign officers to the Iron Curtain countries. And I volunteered immediately for the Soviet Union. And I was given Russian language training. And the State Department at that time did not have a good Russian language program so I was made an exception and I was sent to CIA which had a marvelous program. And at that time the CIA language program was in one of the temples behind the Lincoln Memorial on Ohio drive. And I started there and we were 12 students. I was the only outsider and we had five instructors. It was a marvelous course. We had five linguists. These were all Russian linguists of different backgrounds. There was a lawyer and different, and one linguist. And we were allowed to speak English only with the linguist, with the Russian lang -- And we had two students and one linguist and we changed every hour for five hours every day. So the two of us were with a different linguist and the sixth hour was with the linguist. Well I was there for a week and suddenly word came down that I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, at CIA. I wasn\u2019t allowed to know who people were. And they finally compromised. Since I had already been with my five colleagues for a week, they finally compromised that I could stay there but I couldn\u2019t go into the cafeteria. So for a year I had to bring my own lunch and I couldn\u2019t go into the cafeteria. But I had a terrific experience in learning Russian. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 42"

So I resigned from USIA. I was commissioned in the State Department. Before that happened I was actually, I was with the Voice of America in Munich. As a correspondent and as a writer of commentaries and a correspondent in Munich with the Voice. And then finally I got a visa and was assigned in August 1958. August 58 I was assigned to Moscow. And we were there and I was the first public affairs officer, the first we didn\u2019t call them that. I was the first cultural and press attach\u00e9 in Moscow since World War II. The first one because there was a break sort of in the ice. There had been the Camp David meeting between Eisenhower and then Khrushchev had been to the United States and so they thought that there may be a break and we had signed the first US, USSR cultural agreement in January of 1958. And I was there to, was assigned to carry out that program in August 58. And that\u2019s when we started having exchange programs. And actually my experience from then on is in my last book. And I was thinking I should probably donate a copy of that book to the Holocaust Museum and give it to you and here it 1s. This is my last book, my fourth book.

There had been a strict State Department rule that foreign service officers should not serve longer than two years at that time because of the Cold War situation. But Tommy Thompson, our American ambassador, such a marvelous person, always thought that two years is too short a time for us really to get involved and he asked, since I was actually still in USIA, I had been over. He asked George Allen who was the director of USIA and a former ambassador, and foreign service officer and a close friend of Tommy Thompson. He asked him whether he could ask me to stay a third year. Unbeknownst to me. And he said yes of course and so Tommy Thompson asked me whether I would be willing to stay for a third year. And I felt so flattered to be asked anything by Tommy https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 43 Thompson, I immediately said yes. And then I went home to confront Mimi and our two little children. But she was at that time such a conservative in her life style and even politically at that time, she thought anything is better than a change. So let\u2019s stay for a third year. And we were the first family to stay in Moscow for three years, which of course 1s standard now. It became standard and so we stayed there for a third year. Then I came back to Washington and I became  Ed Murrow was the director of USIA and I became one of his assistants, responsible for the Soviet Union at least in Europe and I was that for three years. I mean actually more. He died, he passed away. And then I was under, and I assigned myself since I was in charge of Soviet Union and Eastern Europe I assigned myself to be public affairs officer in Warsaw. I went and stayed in the area, and we had a fairly large program in Warsaw and I wanted to go to Warsaw. And Mimi and I studied Polish for several months and the new director of USIA came in, Carl Rowan, former you know. And he says he wouldn\u2019t let me go to Warsaw. You have to stay here in this job. Because there is nobody to replace you. So I stayed. I didn\u2019t go to Warsaw, but the next year I assigned myself again to Warsaw and we studied Polish again. By that time Carl Rowan had left and Leonard Marx became the director of USIA. And Leonard Marx called me in and says I\u2019m going to make a proposal to you, an offer to you that you can\u2019t refuse. And I said what\u2019s that. I was ready to go to Warsaw. Within about three weeks. And he said you\u2019re going to go as deputy chief of mission to Bulgaria. To Sofia. And I couldn\u2019t refuse that. So Mimi and I studied Bulgarian for two weeks. And went off to Sofia and where I was DCM, Deputy Chief of Mission. But we didn\u2019t have an embassy yet. We had a legation. So I was consul of legation. And the minister who became a very close friend of mine, had to leave after one year. He was recalled. It was a, well it\u2019s ok. He had an accident where he killed a pedestrian when he was driving an embassy car. And this went on and the Bulgarians were awful about this. There\u2019s this American killing our children and so forth. And he was finally withdrawn and I was charg\u00e9 of the legation for a long period because the person who was to replace him, Jack McSweeney, didn\u2019t want to come to Sofia as a minister. He wanted to be an ambassador. And so he delayed and delayed and they finally told him if you don\u2019t go to Sofia, we\u2019re going to cancel your assignment and he finally came which was about five months, six months later. And so he came. And after Sofia, I got a plush post. I got to be PA or Public Affairs officer in Berlin, my home town. And we were in Berlin for three years and we had a really personally a https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Hans Nathan Tuch November 7, 2013 44 wonderful time because theater, opera, everything was just gravy. However, the job was, became really terrible because the situation in Germany, in Berlin specifically had turned entirely where the young Berliners felt that we were, became the enemy in Berlin. And that\u2019s quite a bit in the book. And the situation that developed and working in Berlin became very, very difficult. And frustrating. And it really didn\u2019t turn around.

            "answer": "I feel, I have a deep feeling the fact that the post war German government starting with Adenauer and subsequently have done a terrific job of redemocratizing their society. And becoming a valued member of the international democratic community. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with individual policies of the German government, especially now. But I feel sociologically and historically they have done a terrific job with the help of the United States. I must say what the United States, what we did in the 1950s to reintegrate Germany into the international democratic society was also a very tough and very remarkable job, where we helped the Germans do it. I mean they had to do it themselves but we gave them a tremendous amount of assistance in doing it. And were very successful and were appreciated by the Germans for doing that. I would say in the 19, especially in the 1950s. Until the early 1960s and I just have felt very personally committed to participating in the reorientation of the German society into a western democratic society. I mean that was a very, I\u2019m grateful for that and I participated in this. And I think 1t was successful and I actually wrote about this, well it\u2019s in this book. But it\u2019s more actually in my previous book which is on public diplomacy and is a \u2014"

Actually the cousin, he passed away last year but he was a very well-known physiologist who came to the United States I think almost every year to lecture at different universities. And his claim to fame was that when the hiyacking of the first TWA plane, he was the one hostage that they kept. They kept him and he was finally released. He was exchanged. Finally was a TWA flight that was I think was in I think Lebanon. And he was the first hostage of the plane. But his wife who was a cousin once removed of mine, about ten years younger. She is. And we are in touch with one another."

And it\u2019s their fault. I tried my damnedest to be in touch with them. They just don\u2019t answer. And when my aunt who happened to be my favorite aunt, their mother, died in Tel Aviv, they didn\u2019t even call me about it. I found out from my cousin in Jerusalem about it and I was mad.

She lives here and I worked with her on the ten years ago when we started this program, I interviewed a couple of the people, and my job really was to try to place the tapes in schools and I did manage it in Kansas City. I worked with her at that. She\u2019s marvelous and she\u2019s still very with it. She runs our public affairs program here. Edith does. So at any rate I feel what you\u2019re doing 1s terrific because you are getting at people and their experiences. I mean I don\u2019t think I have terribly much to contribute to this program."
