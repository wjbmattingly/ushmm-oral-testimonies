And then, by the age of around two, we were put in hiding in a place called Vales(ph) Galant(ph), and I have absolutely no memory of that time. And after I think about \u2014 well, I guess around 1945, we were brought by relatives to an orphanage. I just today learned that we were in several places, but I only know of one place, Taverne, an orphanage in Taverne, a Jewish orphanage, where I was until the age of [indecipherable] until 1948, when \u2014 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
