Why don't we start with your arrival in Westerbork and a--
Westerbork?
Yeah, and then going on the train to Sobibor.
(Clears throat) I came from um, Fircht (?), from the concentration camp, Fircht, I came to
Westerbork in 194...2, 43, and, uh, uh, when I came there, I found an uncle and my mother was
there with the five children, and we came together with these girls that I met, we stayed together
with them, and, and a whole bunch of uh, Dutch girls, we stayed always very close together. Also,
when we were in Fircht, in a concentration camp. So we came in Westerbork, and we were in an
uh, barrack, in an, uh only people were, were, were punished and they were hidden. In Holland, or
something this, uh, this way. So we, we, had no chance to get out, and my uncle tried to get us out,
and Westerbork was a very safe camp. I mean you could stay there, 1t was very good and uh, very
good accommodations and everything. So we, we uh, we were there 8 days, 7 of 8 days, and uh,
then we had to go on a transport to, we didn't know where we went, we had to go to Fircht, it was
the first transport that was with uh freight wagons, and, we went with 60 people in a freight wagon,
and also this uncle what had 5 children, 5 little boys, he went together also in that um, in the train.
I didn't see it, my, I later I found papers in Sobibor, that he went with this train, with this transport.
And we went in, and the, it was very uh, organized done in Westerbork, they did everything very
organized, and when we were in the uh, train, there was uh with all the people and younger people
together, and, uh, there was one bottle in the middle and I think that, and that was the bathroom. I
don't think that, that uh, we, uh, had uh, a way to sleep, we had to sit on the floor, and we went 3
days and 3 nights to Sobibor, uh, when we stopped sometimes the train, and every freight wagon
has a little window on top, and everybody tried to look through it, so when you had chance to look
through it, and you saw people was, was standing like, and they did like that, and we thought they
were just an-anti-Jews, and they know we, we Jews they didn't like us, but we had no idea that they
told us that we go to our death. And, every time when the train stopped, the Germans start shooting
on top of the train, and with, with dogs around us, and it was very panicky, and, uh, it was very
scary, and we hope, you know, we, we girls, we really stuck together, and we helped each other to
stay a little bit in good mood. After 3 days and 3 nights, we thought we were in Russia, everybody

looked so poor, and, uh, we had no idea where we were, and then we come on and we see the big
sign, Sobibor, and when we came in, everything looks very nice, little windows and flowers and,
and uh the house were painted green and red, and, it, 1t looks very nice, and when they open the
doors, these big doors that we had to go out in, start screaming and hitting with the whips, and uh,
we had to go out and out, all, all the people, and there was a little trolley, a little wagon what uh,
the coal miners use that goes, you can uh, uh rip it open that people can easy go out, so all the
people that couldn't walk, they showed them in there, and all the children what got lost from the
parents, they had to go in the trolley, and this trolley went straight to the gas chamber. That was a
special line that went there, and we had to throw away our little suitcases what everybody took with
them, the most important things were in there, and we had to throw away our suitcases, and I
remember vividly that one woman throwed away also an, by accident, her child fell, and she said,
"Oh, my baby!" And, a German say, and he hit her with a whip, and he said, "I will take care of
this baby!" And, so we walked farther, and all the Germans were standing there on the side, all the
SS was, they were always watching all of us when we passing, and so we stayed together with
these young girls, and we were a bunch, I don't remember the amount, and they took us out, and
they say, "Stay on the side." And all the other people went forward, one went right, and one went
left, and we saw everybody going, we saw the woman going to the gas chamber, walking already,
and a man was standing on the side, that's what I remember, and they spoke to them that uh, uh, we
hear them speaking the German that they say, "Here's a card, and now you can write home, that
everything is fine here, and now you going to have to take a shower, and we will take care, good
care of you..." that we hear that he was talking to them. And then, he took us girls, and we went to
Camp One. Sobibor was divided into 3 camps, one camp, 3 was the gas chamber, Camp 2 was the
working camp, and Camp | was the camp where we slept and also where the little uh, place, little
barracks, or little houses together with the buildings, and there were the tailor and the gold ma-
maker, and the uh, different people were sitting down and worked in these places and also we slept
there, the man and the woman slept there, and when I came on, I saw some people from my
hometown. One boy was, especially his parents were my parents' best friends. And I say, "Hi!
How are?!" and uh, they didn't even look at me, and they were afraid to say anything, and was sort
of strange, they have to recognize me. They were all married, uh, men, they were in their 20s, 25,
26, and their wives went already, of course, to the gas chamber. So, when they went away, and
then, we went too, uh, Camp 2, and we had to sort the clothes, and I didn't know what I was doing.
We had to sort the clothes for the people that went to the gas chamber. And, uh, that what was we
were working. First quality, second quality, and the third quality, and uh, we, uh, in the evening,
then, 5 oâ€™clock was the appel, and the roll call, and then we had to go and went to camp One, and
that same evening the, the Jew, we had to dance. There were some Jewish what came there, and
they had some instrument, uh, the violin I think, remember, I don't remember exactly what

instrument it were, and they had to play the music and we had to dance, and Chaim asked me to
dance. This is the first time that I met Chaim. And after that we danced, I, I saw these boys, and
they told, and we had to dance when the fire was already burning and, and you could smell them
here, and, and, and the bone, and, and it really lighted up the whole sky from that they were
burning the bodies from the transport what we came with. I, I don't remember with how many
people I came, I think it was 1500 people, and in, in 3 or 4 hours they could kill all these people
from every transport. So after that we, that was just a sadism from the, from the SS's that we had to
dance, and the fire was burning, and we didn't know anything what was going on and they enjoyed
that, just, we know, how difficult it was for the people that were alone there, that they had to , they
insisted they had to ask us. So after the dancing, I went to the barrack, where, there where we slept,
and I saw these boys, and they told me what was going on. They told me that the fire was uh, all
the people that were uh, went to the gas chamber, and they told me that, and that they were burning
them there. And, I couldn't believe it. I, I think IJ, I didn't, it didn't, I couldn't believe it, and I think
it took me a long, long time that I was alive and every time when I come, came in transport, that I
saw people uh, that I, 1t was something just that uh, I couldn't believe it, and I, I, it took me really a
long time to realize what was, that it was true, and, and, and that all the people what, what we saw
passing by with the little window where we were assorting our clothes, that uh, half hour later they
would all be dead. So, I, I, they told me that they came with their wives, and uh, that their wives
all went also to the gas chamber. When we were, a, a week, or two weeks in camp, there were 72
Dutch men, and there was one German, what was a traitor. He went to the German and told things,
and he told sometimes things what was not even true. And he went to one of the SS, was one of the
Germans, and told them that the 72 Dutch boys want to run away. And we, of course, never found
out if it was true, but we didn't believe it because nobody, everybody knows that uh, for a Dutch
man to run away in Poland, so antisemitic, that there was no chance that he could stay alive
anyway. So, the 72 boys, they took them aw--they had to um uh, stay on roll call, and uh, they took
them away and they shot them all. That was the first thing what I saw that they, we didn't see it,
but we heard the shooting. Uh, after this, uh, we, we went every day to work, and the most work
what we did was assorting clothes, and

Beep.

(Clears throat) Uh, when we came out, the, uh, the people had, they didn't know that we went to the
con, that that we were, there was a gas chamber, nobody, from Dutch people we had no idea where
we went. I thought I go to my mother and my brother's. Well, my brother and my mother were
already sent to Poland, and I had chance when I was in Holland, to get away. Out of that
concentration camp where I was in Holland. I didn't want to go away really. I was the youngest of

4 children, and I, I want to go to my mother, and my mother was already sent to Poland and my
brothers too. So when I went in Poland, and this uncle in, in Westerbork, where we were, we met
in Westerbork, he say that he can get me out, and, from the beginning when I was there, and I say, I
really don't want to go out when I want to go to my brother and my mother. In Pol--I don't know
where they were, I thought they were in a big camp where all the people from Holland went to. So,
um, when I went to, in, in, the, in the train, and they, the transporters there, we all thought we went
to a camp and we had no idea that there was such a thing as a gas chamber or a concentration camp
or a, perhaps a concentration camp, but a, but a camp where we all would work, and then we also,
all families together, and, uh, was a little bit childish perhaps, but that's the way we saw it, we, we
had no idea. But, in Holland, first of all, the Germans took, took the people away, and took them,
and sent them away to Westerbork, and later to Poland, but they were not so harsh to them, that
they were in Poland. In Poland there were much harsher things what they did, with, to Jews. So,
when we went on a transport, all of us girls, and all of the people thought we go to Poland. When
we came out in Sobibor, when they give us this, give the people the card to write home, the people
wrote home because they thought that it will be okay, when they thought they will uh, go, take a
bath and take a shower and not what the Germans told them that they have to take a shower
because there is a, a typhus is growing out of the, is a sickness, and they, they, uh, really thought
they take a shower and go to the family, and go and work there. Because I say, myself, that the
men run to the shower, it was a hot day in the camp,--------------------, and they say, "Come boys,
come boys! We're going to take a shower!" They were Dutch people. "Come, we're going to take
a shower!" And they run to the gas chamber, and, and they were already had all the clothes off,
and they were nude and I saw them running to the uh showers. So, I, and I remember also vividly
now that I was already a, a month or so in camp, and they give us cards that we should write home
that we are in, in a camp, but we're doing well, and, and, and nobody wrote back home from the
Dutch people because they know that um, in Holland they would think that it is okay to come to
Poland, and not to try to hide or do something about it. And, when the Dutch transport ca-came,
everything was more organized. Wha-what everything with the Jew, well the Dutch people walked
to the gas chamber. They had no idea that it was what they went to. And every time when there
came a Dutch, Dutch transport, they walked just, and did exactly what the Germans, sometimes
even they took their hat off. Once came a whole transport with children--500 children, was in one
transport, and 1t came from Holland, there was a Dutch transport, and all little children, they came
from a home??? I didn't see it, they, they locked us up in a, in an, in our first, in the first camp
where we slept. Things like that they didn't let us see. When the polish transports came, was a,
they, a lot of Polish they didn't want to go to the gas chamber, and that was many times that they
shot them, and there was shooting and screaming before, before we, uh, did anything, the assorting
the clothes. Well, they let us, not, especially the Dutch people. The -------------, like my husband

had sometimes to work and take the bodies out of the trains, but, uh, they don't let us see it, they,
they locked us up in the ca--often when there was something going on like that we were not
allowed to see it. The Polish Jews knows what is going on. Uh, I remember once there came a
whole transport from Belgitz, and they made an uprising, and, uh, and I remember that uh, when
we had to assort the clothes, everything was filled with blood, and they locked us up, and we
thought now we will die of course too because they locked us up and we were, were not allowed to
to go out of our barrack where we slept, and uh, the, the, we have shooting and screaming, and it
was unbelievable, and later we had to sort the clothes, it was full with blood, and, and uh then also
in the one of the pants, my husband found in Yiddish written, 'Take revenge," the comment, in
Jewish, "Take revenge." Uh, because, uh, we tried to run away and he told in, in uh Yiddish in uh,
inside of his pocket we found that writing what I remember. It, it was, it was, hell, but, for me, I, I
was, I, I, I met Chaim from the beginning, and we fell in love, and I think that softened our both
lives, what I really think, that, that we closed ourselves a little bit off from really what was, what
the horror things, what we didn't don't want to see. It, I remember like the Dutch people, they
came, many times they came, and they found out that the wives went to the gas chamber, and they
laid down and they died in a week, and also the Dutch people, when you want to eat something,
they were so hungry. See, we worked with the clothes, assorting. And we assorted the clothes and
what we could steal from them, for, what the Germans wouldn't get, we stole also food, and we had
a little bunch of girls that we lived together with. It was one girl what was my buddy, Oola, Oola
Stan, she also survived after the, the camp, and I ----- had a cousin there, what I met, and we shared
always the food, and I was very, I was never afraid, and I remember, it was really heavy. I put all
between my bra and in my uh, underpants food and, and took it with me to where we slept, and we
shared it them with these girls. So, we were not that hungry when there came a transport. When
there didn't come a transport we were very hungry. Sometimes we hided under our pillow, and the
mou-mouse and the rats eat 1t up many times and found some whole nest under my pillow from
these little mouse. But, uh, we, we were not that hungry as the people that worked in the woods,
and then we had to eat sometimes and they just didn't let us eat, and sometimes we were hungry,
Chaim always say, "You have to finish the soup," which was just water, we give it away to them
because they were much more hungry than we, but they got, the people what didn't work in the, in
the, uh, assorting clothes, they died very quickly, especially the Dutch people, and, the intellec-the
bo-boys that came straight from the university, when they came to the camp, somehow they get
sick and died in a very short time. I remember one boy, he came from a very rich family from
Rotterdam, the, ah had a very big uh, business in spices, they did business with Indonesia, and his
wife went to the gas chamber, and this boy, I remember, died in, in, in, 1n a week, just that he
couldn't, that, all what he saw what was going on. Also once, and I got also later on typhus, and
when you have typhus, uh, you don't remember much, you know, like you have very high fever,

and, and you don't remember much what is going around you. In that time, Chaim and my
girlfriend was -------, they, they took care of it, even, you couldn't be sick in SobibÃ©r. When you
were sick, you got shot. When I remember, when I had typhus, one day, I was home, and, one of
the SSs came, and he say to all the men, "Out! Raus! Raus!" and hit them with a whip, and all those
sick people they were standing outside, and had to go out, and they were standing outside, and I
remember boys from the Zionist Organization I belonged to whatever, camping with when I was
young, I was young at that time too, it was 80,90, and I was sort of standing there, and, and all in
the underpants, and they looked so terrible, and I came out, and he say to me, "You go to work!"
And I went to work, and they took them away and they all shot them, all these boys they shot, and I
was just lucky, it was just like a lucky star above me. Every time uh, something really, I thought
â€˜now I'm going,â€™ and...I, they didn't shoot me, I went back to work. Chaim took care of me when I
was had typhus. I remember I couldn't eat and he brought me food, and, and um, I couldn't go
walk, and he brought down into the bathroom, there was a bathroom, it was a little hole in the
ground, and, so, it, it, but, see because we were together, Chaim and I, we, we held, we were not
insane, and, and, I, I think that saved us a lot that we could, could just uh, be more than people what
were alone. And it was, it was just, all these what going on, it was just, it was just a dream, it was
like, like you live in a dream. I remember a Dutch man came where we slept.
We have to reload.
How do you know?
Beep.
Correction, this is SR-2, but CR-3 is up, Sync take 3 1s up.

First I want you to, whatever you were going to tell me, it started "A Dutch man--."
Well, I remember, one day, in uh, uh, a Dutch man came to, the camp, uh 2, where we slept, no

Wagner was standing there in the camp, and he was one of the worst SS's what you can have, and
he say, "What you doing here? And he took an an shovel, and, and, he hit him on his head, and
just, his head fell in 2 pieces. It was just unbelievable. The, the crime! What was going on! It's
just, I can't, I can't believe...I, I don't, I remem-, I don't remember everything because we, we didn't
want to remember everything. But many times the Germans, they hit, we, the, the Dutch people,
the Dutch people, they had for the punishment, they had to run around, to-the whole day, and they
were never allowed to stay quiet. So, so long they had to run for punishment, and work, till they
dropped dead. And that was something what they invented. All the time they invented something
new--the German, and most they had it against the Dutch, what I remember, and...to, against the
Dutch men. Uh, somehow, uh, a woman, they didn't punish so much, somehow, they had a softer
heart for--once I got hit with an, uh, with a whip. I remember one, one in uh, uh, uh, a Jew did tt,
and a Kapo. A Jewish Kapo hit me. I, I say, uh, was in the camp where we slept, in Camp 1, we
slept, and he say, uh, I say, "Oh, the, the Kapos, they show off, and go to the guy--" so I was
screaming, and he heard it, and he came out and he hit me with a whip over my shoulders. I think
it still hurts me know. So painful was that it, 1t can--and once after that I had, a, uh, but most of the
time they didn't do anything to woman. But the men were all the time they uh got punished, the
Dutch people, they got more punished, and, uh, it was unbelievable to see how the uh, uh, uh,
really suffered.

Why did he punish you? What had you done?

I was saying something um, uh, bad words what is a international, an international, and I didn't
know that he is a, a Pole, a Jewish Pole, our Kapo, that he understood it, and so I say a very bad
word, and, and he came and he hit me. I say it about it, and then, he hit me with the whip. Also
once, I, I, somebody, and we had to work always in the woods, and once a k-an uh, SS, hit me, and
we, we didn't wear much clothes, uh, regular clothes, because the clothes from the people that went
to the gas chamber, we, every day we, we took something else out and we wore. We didn't, wear
uh, uh, uh clothes from people that were in like, in, in Auschwitz. We wore regular clothes. So,
very, we wore very thin clothes, and when they hit you, you have nothing under it, it's very, very
painful, --------the whip. And, I, I, I was planning to run away, and then I remember, there's
nowhere to run. And, uh, w-we had to walk uh when didn't came a transport, we were, uh, -------,
we were also very happy many times when there came a transport because we know when there
wouldn't come transport that we go to, we, we will be dead, they will shoot us when there wouldn't
transports come to Sobibor anymore. And we know that that transport is going to, to the gas
chambers, to, to, concentration camps, so every week when there didn't came transports, we were
worried. And they let us do work, like cleaning a woods, the woods, big woods, where there are

from ---------------, and we had to clean that. And they looked for work for us, or we had to uh, cut
down trees, and uh, and we had to bring them uh, uh heavy tree from one place to the other. Or we
have to fill up these trolleys with sand, and we had to uh, push away a bunch of ----------- when we
had to work, that very, that, that kind of a work, in the woods, we had to work. So, when there
came a transport we know we had food, and we had, and we had clothes, and we know we stay
alive because we had work. When there came no transport on the end, when there didn't came any
transports anymore, we know that's the end of our um, of our, that will be the end, we didn't know
what was going on, we thought there wou-wou-won't be any work camp, but we, that was very
scary, SO, SO, when, we were always, it is unbelievable to think this way, but we were happy when
there came a transport and, b-because the transport came anyway, and the Polish transport was
much harder to handle than the Dutch transports when they ------------.

Tell me about your work and also how you could sabotage in your work, what acts of sabotage...?
Yeah, well, we had to assort the clothes, and right away when I came, somehow Chaim worked on
the same table, and we had to assort the clothes of first quality, second quality and I know
everything went to Germany, and I try, every piece that I saw, I tried t-to tear it apart, the clothes,
and I thought that was the only thing that I could do of sabotage. And also when I found money
and jewelry, I didn't give it to the Germans, I give to Chaim. I laid it on the table in a corner, and
Chaim took it most of the time--well Chaim had a friend that worked where the fire m-men, and
they, they burned all the papers, so the man knows that we have to look always on the bottom of
there was some money there, and he put it in the ground, for, and, and hide it in the ground. So,
when, when the, the, I didn't even think for what they did it. I did, I didn't even think that we ever
use it for ourselves. I was just thinking, only thinking what I thought, how can we do eh, on the
sabotage against the Germans. And it was very dangerous when the Germans would see it that we
do that, uh, you get shot because when you, the same thing, I, I took always food with me to the
camp where we slept. And when the Germans, uh, see, saw that I would do that, they just shot you
because once a boy opened a can sardines, and I remember so well, we had all to stand all out of,
everybody has to come to a big whole-uh, area, and we had to stay there, and the, and the boy lay
on the piece of wood, and 2 men had to carry him and he was half dead. Uh, just was full with
blood, and his arm, it was just unbelievable, and he say, "When everybody ever open a sardine or
anything again for food, that will happen to you," and later he, he shoot him, shot him. And, so, it
was very, very dangerous. I remember once, uh, there were a bunch, there were uh, people what
worked in the woods with the Germans, and some killed some Germans in the woods, and they run
away. When the, when the Dutch people, they didn't know where to run to, and they were standing
there, and they brought the Dutch men, they brought to us also, we had to stand on a big tre-uh, uh

place, and, I had a lot of food with me, in, in, in a coat, I remember, in a coat, and one of the girls
was crying, and her husband was with, with one that was standing there, and I know the German
wouldn't ask her, and I say, "Will you hold my coat because I know when they, uh, uh looking over
what I have with me, they will shoot me right away, and I know they will not shoot her because uh,
they will not look at her because they know she was crying, and they have sometimes a little bit
feelings with, for something like that, and uh, it, it, it's very, it was very, very dangerous to do
anything what, what was not allowed. Uh, the, what I had, when these men came back, and we all,
the whole camp had to also stay together, the whole camp, and there were um, 10 or 12 uh men,
they put them also there together, and they, uh, they shot them each separate, uh, because, uh, that
they were, that they run away from uh, uh, from Sobibor, and killed some from the uh, Ukrainians.
These people, people, they run away, they made it, they made after the war, they died already. I
think they died, one died for sure, and uh, they made it out of the camp. Uh, it, it was the o-the,
very dangerous to do anything at all what the Germans uh, uh wouldn't allow, of course. (Sigh)
Of those people, how many escaped and then how many died from the escape?
Uh, two uh, uh run away, ---------. Two, I thi-two uh, uh were escaped. When, after the war, when
we had to go uh, when we were in Lublin, one of the men say to us "You can come and live with
us." And, we stayed with him. And the other, I, I don't know where he is, I never heard about, I
think he went to Israel. But two, and uh, it was um, eleven people were shot, and, and we had to
see that, that they were shot. But, you know, I had a system, Chaim and I, we always made that we
stayed next to each other, and I never looked. I saw them falling, but I didn't look on the moment
that they were shooting, and I did it with all the things when shooting was very, many times they
showed that they shot people, or, I, I try not to look all the time, because, I don't know, that was my
s-system 0-0-of surviving, of surviving, uh, not to see when, when somebody was completely
almost half dead, and, and, and like the, the Dutch people that were almost half dead, and full with
blood, that, that they hit them, the way you see them in the eyes, you, you, you want to help them.
So, when you don't look at them...

Why did you use your system of not looking into their eyes?
Because when I would look in their eyes, and I would their eyes, I would go to them, and help
them. And would, I, you know, I would start crying over it, so when I don't look in their eyes,
don't, don't I, don't feel, I could, you could not do anything anyway. You couldn't do anything
anyway. So when I don't look in their eyes, I, I, I don't feel that I, I don't have to do anything, that I
think it was just a shield for myself, to save myself, you know, excuses, or, uh, it was a sh-I just,
that, that, I, I remember, I always, I, I always, I never looked at anything real, that, that's my system
of, now too, I uh, we never look uh bad movies, we never see terrible things, we always, you know,
that's our system, I think, we just survi--it's our way of surviving, uh, and not, not, the, also I
remember that, that man what they cut his head in half, I, I saw it, and then I didn't look anymore, I
just look at the world, I don't look anymore, because uh, we had to stay once on a roll call a whole
night, and uh, and, everything what happened around me, I just stayed next to Chaim, and we just
both, just, don't try to see everything what is going on, and...
Tell me about Frenzel.
Frenzel took me out of the transport. And I don't know what it was, he was also the one that told
me when I was so sick, and had typhus, and he killed all the other uh, people, say "Back to work."
Frenzel... don't know, he saved me, my life sometimes. And he was a terrible man. And, he was
the one that we had to dance the evening, and, he was, he was, uh, uh, he, he, would, he'd give
Chaim those 45, with the, with the whip. But when I did heavy work once, he took me out, and let
me do a whole day, we had to, uh, with soap that people brought, we had to make it in little pieces,
and we had to, had to do uh, work with soap, and, and um, but also I, it, I, I was afraid for him,
scared to death for him, of course because the man, they can change like that, uh, with, with, with
the idea, what you have, and I was afraid that uh, that Frenzel, uh, that people would, would see
that, that they, that he was to me. But, I remember once uh, we were standing altogether in Camp
One, and one of the woman say, "Selma is a spy," because Fre-what Frenzel did to me. And Oola,
my buddy, say, "Are you crazy? She cannot help that Frenzel helps her with things like that."
And, uh, so it's 1t was very dangerous that an, an, SS what kills any people sometimes took me out
for, for work to do, but...that was, I don't know why, it was just my luck perhaps. When Chaim and
I w-worked together always, also the SSs, they laughed about Chaim and me. And they say, "The
Braut and Brautko??" Chai-Chaim and I always worked together, and, and we were always

together, and, and they always laughed about us. So it was really more a joke perhaps from the SSs
when they know that we will die anyway. They didn't think that we will make it uh, uh once to
freedom.

Tell me about the uprising.

I had, on the end, uh, of camp, the, I had the uh, typhus. And, I was very sick. I don't remember
much about it. So, that was time also that we went out of uh, of where we slept, we went, they
made, the camp got very big. Somehow, the last month of the camp, we go a lot of people from
Minsk, from the, from the ghetto from Minsk, came to Sobibor. And the camp, amount of people
grow, I think that 400 to 600 people, one, uh, there were only 125 people in the camp all those
months, 4 or 5 months that, that before the camp was so big. So there came the transports from
Minsk, a transport. Also, once I walked, and there was a girl that was in Svole, my hometown, in
Holland, and she went back to Germany also, but she came also from the Minsk transport also to uh
Sobibor, back, it was very unusual to see somebody that you met in your hometown once. And, I
had, uh, and on the end, I had typhus, and the camp got very big, and we came to an, we went to a
new barrack, new place where the, we all slept, and it was bigger, and, uh, I was a little, a little bit
better, and one day, Chaim say to me, "Go, we, go, and..." uh, and, that was a day, two days before
the uprising. He say, "Go and try to get a pair of boots, and get some warm clothes, ---------, and I
will tell you later. So I say, "No, I don't want to go," he say, "Go." So, I went, and I went to uh,
by, a place where there was an German SS, and he was pretty good for the Jews. He got also not
punished after the war. And he got me a pair of boots. And I got a leather jacket, and I got some
warm clothes, and the next day, Chaim told me to come to a place where all the clothes was for, all
the medicine and everything was in that big house. He said, "Come there on 4 0 clock." Chaim
was the only man that told his girlfriends to go with him. He's the only man that took his girlfriend
with him. All the other Polish people, Jewish people, that were already had, all girlfriends, and
they all, all left them there. And, uh, they, they, some were sick, but nobody took his girlfriend.
Chaim was the only one that took his girlfriend, and he say, "Come down 4 0 clock." So, I walked
to that place at 4 o clock, and I remember vividly, very well, that one of the uh, Visupski was his
name, I think his name was Visupsky, he killed just a f--when I came in he killed just a few SSs
already. And it was very tense, and he said, "Here's a pill for your nerves," and he put it in his
mouth, and he spit it out, said, "I don't need that." So, we were in there in that, in that house, it was
a big, big, house what I remember, looks, I don't remember, it was very big, perhaps it was not that
big, and there were all the medicine, and, if the house ware was there from the transport, the people
put, the German put it there, and Chaim and I, we were standing there talking with a young man
outside, and it came so far that the one young man had to go and kill Neumann, no, not Neumann,

uh, another name, forgot his name, had to kill him, and, he say, "I'm afraid." I said, "Chaim, are
you crazy, there the, already eleven, ten or eight are dead!" Said, "You have to go!" Said he, "I'm
afraid." And to Chaim, went inside, and took a knife, of --------------, and took a knife, quickly a
knife, put it in his pants, in his shoes because he had boots on, and went away. I didn't even see
him going. And, I, I remember, I didn't see Chaim, and I didn't see Chaim, and I went looking for
him, and I hear from, from a room where he was killing them, a noise, like he was killing a, a pig,
when I heard, I heard, I heard sometimes a pig-killing, when we lived in Holland not far from
farmers, and screaming, and I went quickly back, and we went back to the place where, where we
had, where Chaim told me to be, and we had to go on roll call, and I went on roll call, and I think,
"Oh God, what will I do without Chaim?" And then we walked, and then Chaim came out of this
house, full with blood, and I thought, "We, we going into the world, I had no idea, I know that we
would run away, but I no I-, I thought we were going wherever a lot of people, so I cleaned quickly
all the blood from his face, and he had a big wound on his arm, and I took something, I don't know
what, and I put it around his arm, and then we walked, and then came a truck, a big truck, but an SS
came on, and, the same Visupsky jumped on this truck, because when he would have gone to his
office, and see that they killed already there an SS, where Chaim went, so he trav-uh, the, uh,
Visupsky jumped, jumped on this truck, and they killed him. He never, he got, he didn't got out
alive. And we went to the camp, to the first camp, Camp One, and there were all the Jews, say
already, "Hurrah!" and there came a Ukraine and they killed him another one on the bicycle, and
we went, "Hurrah!" and they start shooting, they start shooting from all sides, and Chaim took my
hand, and all the people were already there, Chaim took my hand, and there was a little house, and
then we saw Frenzel had a pill or something in front of him, and start also shooting, so everybody
stopped at the little house because that house was there, and then we had to go farther. Chaim took
my hand, and he say, "Come!" and we run, and all the people start on running, also again, and we
start run, and we run, I think to the exit, and we heard people screaming, and we heard people
falling on manhole against us, and we were lucky, we just run and run and I remember, uh, I
thought, oh I had a necklace around my neck, with all Jewish emblems on it, from all the people
who, that went to the gas chamber, and, somehow I found it, and I think, I better take it off, and I
remember taking it off, and throwing it away, and we run, and I took my coat off, and I took
everything off all the warm clothes that I, that I had on, I took everything off, and we run and we
run and we run and we run, till we were middle in the woods, and we saw Kurt Thomas, and Kurt
Thomas say to me, "Where's Milly, his girlfriend?" You better not put it in, -----. Anyway we
run...(laughs).

What was I saying? Oh, were running.

We run and run and, we came to a spot and then we saw a whole bunch of people from Sobibor,
and we were happy to see some more people, and, but they were afraid for me, because they didn't
that a Dutch woman, you know, that, I will be traded, or, you know, and how can I will make it.
So, they want to shoot Chaim. Somebody was crazy, I don't know who it was, he was just crazy
and want to shoot Chaim, and I jumped in front of Chaim, and they didn't shoot me, and so Chaim
and I, we went alone, and we went away, and we went, Chaim, we had some money because, from
the money where were hidden in the ground, and he had some money with him, a lot of money I
think, I don't know how much. In that time we thought it was a lot of money. And he went to a
farmer, and the farmer say, "Yes, you can stay overnight here." And there was, we stayed in the
attic, in the farmer's house, and there was a little town, and somehow, people, the Germans went
from house to house, from farm to farm, and they skipped where we were. And all the people in
most houses, dragged them out, and they shot them. Because they run away a lot of people from
camp, but most people got caught, so I think that not more than 40 or 50 or 30, we don't know
exactly the amount, that were alive after the war. So, uh, we, we stayed there overnight, and that
was the first night that I was together with my husband alone, was still my boyfriend, and there was
no bathroom and it was horrible, and I had diarrhea because we have typhus, you get diarrhea, and
when you're nervous you get diarrhea, and I somehow never forgot I had to go to the bathroom
there, and, and years and years and years later, years and years later, I still felt awful that I had to
go to the bathroom the upstairs and just left it such a mess, in these people's house there, that was
just for me, one of the things, crazy, but that was...From there, we walked, and we walked, at, at

night. In daytime, we hide in the woods. And many times, uh, we walked at night, and there came
a dog after us, got barking, and we didn't, we walked on the stars. Chaim wanted to go to his
farmer, and we walked on the stars. And, we couldn't, we, we went the wrong side, I mean, who
car-who cares, we went, and, we came in the woods, and, sometimes we saw an animal, and saw
his legs, we thought it was a ----------- that was looking for us, and we slept the whole night there,
and, and, uh, once we went in a very big woods, and, and before we went in the woods we saw a
body laying there, and we were scared to death to go in there, but, we didn't know where we were
going really. We just walk on the stars. And, uh, we walked two weeks. We didn't have to eat,
and I remember, I jumped once in water, and I took my boots off at night, and daytime when we
hid, hid somewhere, and I couldn't get my boots on anymore, so I had to walk, I have, Chaim had
to cut it open, and I had to walk on the side of my, of my shoe, the whole, whole time, and, and,
when the shoe got small, I couldn't, the boots got smaller, I couldn't get 1t on anymore, and, so it
was, and, and, and, we, we couldn't wash, we didn't have to eat, we, uh, we were hungry, we had
little bit food what we could find in the fields, we were eating. And, we tried to find the Partisans,
and we couldn't find them, and we hide daytime, sometimes we tried to get to a farmer, but never
could f-find a farmer uh, where we could stay. Chaim, my husband, remembers that we could stay
with farmers, but I don't remember that we ever stayed with any farmer at night. And, we hide uh,
once in an hay...stack, and w-we had kids coming to it, and they say to each other in Polish, well, I
didn't understand them, my husband told me, that we go jump on this haystack, and we lay under
the hay, and uh, they came on top of us, and they ran off and say, "Jews! Jews!" How they know
that so quick, I don't know, but they say, "Jews! Jews!" And they ran away, and we quickly went
off, and there came 2 farmers with a car where we were walking in a field, and they took us, and
they ask us if we want to take, go with them, and one took Chaim, and the other took uh, I with
them. And when we drove away, Chaim, they didn't unders-know that Chaim spoke Polish, and
they say to Cha--to each other, "Somehow, we will take the money from them," or something like
that, and Chaim say to me, "Selma, jump!" and I jumped and he jumped and then we run, and we
run, and we, I remember also vividly we went once, and we were so thirsty, and we went to a
farmer, and we asked if we can have a little bit of water, and he say, "No." It was a very beautiful,
uh, farm. Could see the sitting bay and the fireplace, and he said, "No!" and closed the door in
front of us, so, uh, we hadn't, we had no -------, we didn't see Partisans, we didn't know, we, that
we're hungry, we didn't have anything to eat, and we didn't know what to do, and once we came to
a farm, and he took us in, and Chaim ask him if he can hide us. Slept in the barn, we always slept
in, always when we slept in the haystack, and he say, "No." I cannot, I didn't understand all these
things, of course, with the, with the polish, I didn't understand a word, Polish. And, he says, "You
know, by my brother." So, he dressed me up like an old woman, and I was 20, (ha ha), and, with a
old woman, and, uh, he brought us, uh, Chaim was uh, in a wagon, and on the, on the, and branches

over him, and we were lucky, well, it was very, very dangerous what the man did. One went, a
German would ask him, "What, what are you having there?" he would shoot him and he would go
his farm and shoot his whole family, and burn down everything. So, he brought to a farmer, his
name was Adam, and when we came there, we, he let us in a room. We had very bad scabies, and
this 1s sickness on the skin, from dirt. Ver--I had it very bad, Chaim not so bad. And we had lice,
of course, Sobibor, and, very, very bad, I had it over my whole body. And, uh, uh, when we, he,
we could wash us, he let us wash, and he saw that Chaim had a lot of money, he had it under the
bandage on his leg, and he saw Chaim had a lot of money, and I think, he didn't think that he wants
to help Jews, he's thinking that it's for the money. Perhaps he did it also for, it's not, no, I think
perhaps he did it also to help these people. Chaim say he, because he saw me, I was young, and,
and he, and he, he always thought somebody from, from Holland or from New Yo--from our,
America, he always wanted to go to America, the farmer. So, because of me, what Chaim thinks,
he took us in. And also of the money. We give him all the money what we had, and, uh, so, we
cou-we were, we stayed above the cows, in, in the barn with the cows, and above they had beams,
and on the beams was hay stacks, and above was, and, a hay roof, with holes in it. Thank God we
could look through the holes, we didn't have anything to do the whole day, and we were not
allowed to move. Once we moved, and he came down the farmer on the bottom, and he moved,
and the farmer said, "What is that?" Say, "Oh," he said, "We have some rats, uh, rats, upstairs,"
which was true. There were rats all over. So, we were not allowed, we were there 9 months, and
we were not allowed to move, we were not allowed to talk, and we had a little pail in the front of
us, our toilet, and we were under the, what I said before, the lice, and he tried sometimes to burn
our clothes in, in, when in the hot stove, to kill the lice, but it didn't work, and uh, we did, is a
medication in Poland, and of course here too, that when you can put it on the Scabie, and it dies
right away. So, we were very sick from it because I had it on my back and on my body, and it, it
was, it itched, 1t was very, very painful, and I was, I was very sick. I was, I could almost not walk,
and, and so we asked him, we have one watch, and when we give him the watch, if they want to go
for us, and pay that in Helm, there was a little town not far from we lived, and want to pay us the
medication. And finally once they did it where the, the, it was so in our skin, that uh, it, it, the
ointment didn't help anymore, and we were very upset of course, we, we blamed this man. We
didn't get much to eat. And we didn't wash ourselves, I think, just once, in all the nine months, we
never washed ourselves. Well we didn't, ah we didn't care. We were not hungry, real hungry, but
we got once a day we got food, and, we, we saved always the bread, and we put it between our
heads, the rats came at night, and they took it away, so we didn't do that anymore, and, and we, we
felt very uh, uh, miserable there because we thought that they were not good for u-us. Now, after
all these years, and af-right after the war we know that they were very good for us because they
really saved our lives, but it was very dangerous because when the neighbors were all big

antisemites, and I knitted sometimes for her, when she was spinning, she made, uh, weaving her
own, uh, yarn from linen, and I knitted clothes for this little boy that was 2 years old or 3 years old,
and the neighbors ask her how you got these nice clothes, so, that was already dangerous, when
she, they know they couldn't afford to buy it. So, we, we didn't do anything the whole, there, from
the beginning, we were allowed to knit. Chaim was knitting, and I was knitting, but later on we
were not allowed to do anything uh, for them, so they, they were very, very poor, and it was a very
uh, I go too much into that?
(Sandy says something--can't hear).
I go too much into that?
No, we have to reload.
Beep.
Okay, you were just concluding with the family, who, in a sense, rescued you and Chaim by hiding
you. You were telling me they were poor, and...
Yeah, yeah, yes, we were uh, they were very poor, and they did the best that they could really, and
we want, perhaps, we felt so sorry for ourselves laying there, and, uh, on the end, I remember, uh,
there, there was a little boy that was running after the birds, and it was already, we heard already
the Germans coming up a, uh, we hear already nearer coming the, uh, war coming, the front. We
hear already bombs near, coming to us, and a little boy went after these, and uh, at once he sees us.
And thank God a day later, were, were the Germans run a-we saw the Germans running away, and
uh, we got freed. Uh, it was a very difficult time. Uh, uh we were, we didn't have anything to do.
Also once we were watching always the storks, the storks on the chimney, and we were watching
the storks when we didn't have anything else to do. And, the storks went away. And, the uh, the
farmers, uh, they think that it brings some-something to them, or a fire or something is coming to
them when the storks going away. So one day he say to me, "What are you doing the whole day?
Are you perhaps watching the storks?" And we say, "Yes." So, so, he, when the, when the storks
going away, you have to go. We cannot have you anymore because then is uh, something bad will
happen to us. So, we stopped watching the storks, and thank God, the storks came back. And, I
was very weak. I didn't know that I was pregnant. I didn't have, I didn't have my period all these
years that I was in concentration camp, and I was very weak, I couldn't walk anymore, and I didn't
get heavier, and, I, I couldn't s-s-sit up almost anymore, and we didn't know anything that was

going on, and the, the woman uh, where we were hidden say, say that I was pregnant, I said, "No,
that's not true. I have, I don't grow, and well, I didn't walk, and I was just laying. And she say,
"You have to go. We don't want you anymore. And later we talked that it is not so, and now, and
then, in July the, July, we went down, and then I found out I was six months pregnant. And that
was, we never told this in 40 years, and that was very bad of course, well, we thought, what will we
do? We had nothing. We went, it was free, we were free. We had no money, we had nothing,
absolutely nothing. No, no clothes, only what we had on, and that was it. So, we went to Helm,
and then we found, we thought we were the only Jews alive, of course, we thought every
concentration camp was really like Sobibor, but, and then we found more people alive in Helm.
We came in a home in Helm, and then Chaim had to go in the army. And I was there in Poland, all
alone, I didn't speak Polish, we had no money. So Chaim started working in a hospital. We saw
that helps. And, I also never forget, once...they all went back to Sobibor. All the Jews went back to
Sobibor because all the Jews, we put so much money in the ground, and everybody went back to
Sobibor to get, take the money out of the ground, and they starting fighting there and killing each
other. So I said to Chaim, "That's not worth it. You don't go." So, we didn't go back to Sobibor to
get the money uh, out of the ground. But all, most Jews did it. And one Jew did, and one of the
Jews, Chaim knows already a little bit around, he was always in business, and so we walked a little
bit around, and one gave him a hundred dollar bill, and Chaim say, "I know a place where I can
change it for you." So, perhaps I can change it for you, but of course, the number was gone, and
that was not valuable. So, we put it that night under our pillow. And middle in the night,
somebody stole it under our pillow out. So, the next day, Chaim told him, and he didn't believe it,
of course. So, the first morning that Chaim made with, I don't know with what, with working in the
hospital, not to go in the army when we saw that we get free in the army, and later this was not.
Then he start selling, I think, gasoline, what he brou--I don't know what he did really exactly, I
don't remember, and we paid this man off. So, so that was a ver-a very bad situation. I have to tell
something that, 20 years, 15 years later we were in Israel, and we came together with all the Jews
from Sobibor, and I say to the man, "Do you remember the hundred dollars that they stole under
our pil-pillow?" He said, "Yeah, you still owe me the hundred dollars." And the next day, he came
with somebody, and we paid him the hundred dollars because he say he nee--my husband say,
"When he needs the hundred dollars so badly that he has to come to Israel, if, to our house, then he
needs it very bad." So, when we went, went away from Sobibor, from this farmer, we stayed with
uh, in Helm a very short time. Well, you don't want to know that.

I want to ask you a couple things. I want you to talk about how you lived for one minute to the
next when you were in the camp. I want you to go back, and tell me how you feel you survived.

Okay, I don't remember. Uh, I, I, how, we survived in Sobibor was most because we had each
other. I don't think that, I would have been like all the Dutch people who died very quickly after
that, that, I think that we had each other, and also we were very close, and uh, I found a cousin
there, a first cousin. And, and, and a girl where they came from Holland, Oola. Oola was there.
We stick together, and we helped each other very much because, uh, I got typhus, and she took care
of me, and I took care of her when she was sick, and we took care of each other. And the, the, the
tense atmosphere in Sobibor was so bad that I, I, I don't want even to think back on that, how, how
bad it was. Because every minute of the day, we were called to do something else. Like, when,
even when we walked from Camp 2 to Camp 1, we had to, we never could walk regular, we had to
sl, uh, uh, --------------------, throw ourselves on the floor, and we had to go up, and the man with
the whip on the back of us that we had to do that till we almost not could walk anymore. Uh, when
we came on, we had to stand in line for food. Sometimes there was no food. And sometimes, the,
the, the once I remember the coo-the cook, they, they killed him almost when he was sitting middle
of, of the place in the middle from where we, were sleeping, and, uh, we, we, uh, we couldn't get
food on that day, and I remember once, an, a young man, he was 16 years old, and he was the
favorite of one of the SSs really, and he was sleeping, and one of Wagner came into his room, and
he said, "Go,---------------, " and he hit a little bit some with his whip when he had this whip laying
next to him. And the, the SS took him out and shot him. And, that, that was, every minute of the
day was a, was, a Such a, in, in danger, in danger about your own life that, I, I, that we tried not to
think about it at all because I remember that we had to go in the woods once, and, and pick uh,
blueberries. And on the end of the day they had to show our tongue of we, had a, if we eat one of
the blueberries. And we would have eaten all of the blueberries, they would have punished us with
40 whips or 80 whips, but they didn't shoot so much woman, the more the men. Uh, and it it,
everything that you did was, what was, was scary, and was dangerous. Also we had uh, uh, to pick,
uh mushrooms in the woods, I remember. And, I put it in my underpants all over. And they ask us,
"Did you hide something?" I was very heavy from the water, --------------, in camp, so they didn't
see it that I had it, was full with mushrooms, but when they would have looked at it, they would
have should, they would have done something to punish me. Uh, but--------------, every time you
saw somebody else got punished and got hit, and we have to look all the time when they give 45
whips or uh, the, all the time we had to look that they did things like that, and I think that we didn't
get insane, it was because we had each other, Chaim and I. We were always together, we try, not
when we work most of the time, in daytime when we had to go in the woods, but then I was worry
if I was here. Once we were, uh, on a roll call, and, uh, there was and, uh somebody ran away, so,
they took ten, every ten people they took out, out of the roll call, and Chaim was #9, and I was
standing there, you know, it was, you were always, always uh, uh in danger. Many times we had to
stay the whole night on roll call uh, because there was an a dog or a cat or some one of the ----------

, and they thought that we run away. And, and, Chaim and I, we al-always stayed together, and,
and I think that that made me uh, that made us that we are we stayed uh, I think, I really think that
saved our lives.
Before the war, tell me about...
Beep.
I want you to tell me about the choices that you think the Germans and Ukrainians had as guards.
How you mean?
Did they do things of their own free will, or was it all ordered, and then what choices did the Jews
have?
The, the Germans could do with us what they want. They had no orders whatsoever. They could
kill us, they could harm us, they could punish us, they could do anything they want. The
Ukrainians, I don't know much about because they, I, I don't know much about because they, I
didn't speak Polish, and I couldn't talk with them at all, and they were always more on the outside--
I really don't remember much about it. But, uh, they were such, also such antisemites, they, they
were there of free will, and the Germans were in, in Sobibor for, because of the free will, they
didn't have to come. They didn't have to go in the, in the war, fighting on the front when they went
to a concentration camp, so they went by themselves to the SS. Uh, the Germans, they had free
will and they could do anything, and they did. They had, that was there biggest pleasure, to tell
each other, uh, that we killed, uh, one of the SSs called, uh, told once that he could kill, he had a
very big whip made, that he could kill a Jew in 10 whips, instead of 40 for somebody else, or 50.
Uh, once he had uh, Frenzel telling that he uh, that he throws babies in the fire, uh, what, from the
transports, what he came on, what was too much work to put them perhaps uh, in the gas chamber.
Uh, they could do anything they want. There was not such a thing--humanity--what were in these
Germans, uh, at all. Perhaps one, one, what was, what give me the boots, but uh, like Frenzel and,
and Wagner, and Wolf was, what, what was sometimes nice to us, my, also he was eating bread,
and he said, "Here, would you like to have a piece?" and we said, "No," most of the time, and they
let us singing and dancing all the time when the fire was there, we had to do, no, I don't think there
was one decency in these people's bloods whatsoever, uh what I don't uh, uh, in the Ukraine, uh,
they, they, I don't know much about it. The Polish Jews, they know more about that because they
could talk their language, but, uh...

What about the Jews, did they have choices? Talk about the choice to leave or not to leave.
No, it was no choice. We had no choice for anything. We had no choice. I remember, once, I
walked, I don't know how come, I walked by myself, and I saw people from my home town sitting
there on the side, the, the cantor from our temple, and then I saw ----------, and I said, "Hi" to them,
and then I remember I better don't say anything when I, when he say Hi to me, then he, then they
will say uh, "Oh, you want to sit there too?" and that's the end o-of me. We didn't have, we didn't
have anything. We just were like a, a herd of, herd of sheep, and we had to everything what they
say, and God forbid we, we did. We tried to everything what the Germans say, I remember, once,
uh, out of the window that I saw a whole family from my hometown, uh, walking, whole family,
father, mother and children, and I, I just, I, uh, uh, was maybe sure that they wouldn't see me, but
when they would have seen me, wh-what would I have said? Uh, and, and I know that uh, I see
them still walking, and, and, after the years I forgot the names, but many times I saw people that I
know from, well, from face, uh, walking to the death, to the death. But we didn't have anything to
say in camp. Nothing. We just made sure that we were always in the background, and that we
didn't, uh, especially Chaim always told me, "Be in the background. Don't let them know who you
are," and we tried that so much as possible, and I think that was of the things that uh, (clears throat)
that saved, that we were saved, that we were not muscled?? to death, because, uh, a lot of them
were muscled to death, uh, especially Dutch people. But somehow the, the, they saved a lot, the,
the Dutch uh, woman, the woman, I saw how uh, the men was more, more uh, in danger of it, and
Chaim always tried to push me, when I am already quickly go in the front and do things, and come
up for people. No, he always told me, "Stay out of it, stay out of it. Leave it alone." And you
couldn't do anything anyway. There was nothing that you could do. Uh, you could nothing do.
Was nothing, nothing. You had to just take care of yourself. And, to sabotage to, against the
Germans, both of us do sabotage. Where we once, where, in the camp where we slept, that that
was the only thing we could do, stay in the background, and, and don't show yourself so much in
the front. That's all.
Before the war, can you tell me about the J on passports, and how the underground removed yours,
and then -----------------------.
I don't remember much what they did. When I was home, and, and there came a Catholic priest
what lived on our street, and he came to me and he say, um, "What do you, how do you think you
can save your life?" And I say to him, "The only way is that I uh, wo-be, be as a non-Jew, and that
somebody picks me up." And he, and somebody else came to pick me up early in the morning, that

was coincident, my English teacher, and he pick me up early in the morning at 5 0 clock and went
with the bicycle, and that was the last time that I saw my mother and my, and my brothers, my
family, I never saw them again. And, I think I came to a nurse from my hometown. Darot was the
name. And she, through her, they, they, she knows what, she was in the underground, and through
her, they took the J from my passport because that's the only way that I, that I was, by a woman that
was, say, where I was, she was good. Because she, I went after 3 months, waiting, hiding with her,
she took a whole family in, and I had to go to another family, and the other family were traitors,
what I found out after the war, I didn't know. And I was hidden there 3 months, and, and they, uh,
had 28 Jews hidden there, and they all got caught, and they didn't do anything to them, and so and,
and, uh, you want me to tell you about how I was caught? Caught. Uh, I, uh, when I was hidden
there, I was all alone always in the house, and I was, uh, 19 years old, and I was very depressed,
and very, I had to clean the house, I was the maid there, and I was a spoiled brat from home, I
never had to do anything, and I had to do everything there, and they went away the whole day, and
we didn't, I didn't get anything to eat. Well, there was not much food in Holland. There was, it was
very, it was a ver-a really starting to get ve-uh, no food, and uh, where the people were very
hungry, and I uh was alone, and there was in the street where a lawyer, there were Jewish people
hidden. And after that, it was a few months, they say I could go there, and visit them. And when
the minute I come in, the Germans come, so there was it, somebody told the Germans. And, the
Germans, and the police, the Ho--the Dutch Police came, and they, and when I was there, I say to
them, the, the, they ask me the passport, and I show my port, uh, passport, and I say, "Oh, but I'm a
nurse, and I come here to help these people, and they loo-hold my passport to the light, and they
right away saw there was a, there was the J, from Jew, was in there, and so there was nothing what
they could do. So, so uh, they right away took me, and also the family that was there, there was a
father and mother and 2 children, and they all had asthma, I remember they were so sick from--
asthma comes up when they, when you're nervous, and they were so sick, and the woman where
they were hidden, uh, was an older lady from 80 years old, so the Germans asked me where I was
hidden, and I didn't want to tell them. Because the, uh, the day bef-uh, before I was, came another
Jewish family living upstairs, and I thought when they find out that I was caught, that perhaps they
have a chance to get away, and that was happened, and, uh, they uh, somehow got the note that I
was, that the German took us, of, of the police, and, uh, see they had time to get run away. But
they, after the war, they sent me a letter that, of, of thanks, And, but the woman where, what they,
were, or the lady where they were caught, she told the Germans where I was hidden, and they went
later over there, and they took uh, what it was, I don't know exactly, but I went down to Utza in the
police station, and I stayed there 8 days, and I had a chance to get away, but somehow, I didn't. I
didn't want to go away. First of all, I had no money. And I thought, I didn't know the underground
was already that strong, and I uh, didn't want to go in, in or out if the Ger-the police give me little

notice here. We probably like to take you out, we probably like to take you out. And, I didn't get
along with my sister-in-law, she's still alive, I didn't get along with my sister-in-law, and I visit
once my brother, and they were locked up in the little room with the 2 kids, and it was dirty, and it
was miserable, and I say, I rather go to my mother in Poland than go to my brother when I get out, I
have to go to my brother, and be hidden there, and, and help him with the little kids--I didn't know
that there was a gas chamber or something like this, so I go rather to my mother in Poland, than I be
locked up in there, with my brother there, so I didn't get out of the, uh, out of the, uh, police station.
After that, they sent me, we were in, in an um, in, in Amsterdam in jail. In 3 months I was in jail.
And (clears throat), the, we were 10 woman in a little room, and it was very interesting because
everybody tells the life story, and they were all, well, there was a professor's wife, one was a girl
from the street, and one was deaf?? And, uh, and, we, it wasnâ€™t, we didn't feel any danger, and,
and, and anyway, I didn't, I thought we go to, I had, I didn't think anything. And we got, my family
from Amsterdam where we were sent me sometimes packages, and one of the g-guards that opened
the door recognized somehow that I wa-that my brother was in hotel school, and that uh, she knows
him, and from that time out we get double food, all of us in the cell got extra food. So, we didn't
have it that bad in, in the, in the jail, jail. Uh, 1t was uh, we had to walk every morning so like a,
like you see in the Sing-Sing, where there always some-sometimes movies from, and we stayed
there, or, I stayed there 3 months. And then I went out of there, and we went to a concentration
camp, and in the office, I met a whole bunch of Dutch girls. I met these Dutch girls, we stayed
together till Sobibor. We, and, we from there, we went to uh, Furcht, we were in a concentration
camp in Holland 3 months, and uh, I was also very lucky, there comes a man to me, and he say,
"Are you not the daughter from the ho-from the Weinberg-from the hotel in Zuola, and I say, "yes."
Said he, "I have a job for you." And he was the big shot already. It was, the camp was just
opened, and he uh, give me a job assorting clothes in the, in the laundromat, and I worked in the
laundromat, and it was very good because I was that, uh, uh, big, I had that uh, to tell people what
they had to do. And, I could get away from there too. I could have gone in the laundry, in the
basket sit in, very easy, but, I didn't know that there was an underground in Holland, and I didn't
have money. When I would have had some money in my pocket, I would have done it. But, I
thought, when I come out of here, where do I go? They can right away see I'm Jewish, and, and,
and, and, I don't know why I thought this way that they right away could have seen that I was
Jewish, that's what I thought because in my hometown, was a not so big town, they would have
right away seen, had, uh, recognized me, and, so, I went, from there, I went to uh, after 3 months, I
went to Westerbork, and in Westerbork...

Thank you.
