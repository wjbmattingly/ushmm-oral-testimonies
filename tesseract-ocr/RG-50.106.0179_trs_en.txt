wanted — oh yeah, already wanted to take, because the German said take off your
coat and stay in line. And — and it was cold, and I kind of tried to take out the coat,
and I couldn’t take it off, so I put 1t on back, and I stand wi — til our line was come,
we are going to be dead in a minute. So the line was going slowly, slowly, slowly,
and so we stay, my father, mother, we stay all together, and my uncle, and the two
little babies. And suddenly, you know, this is the worst moment in my life. I know
why I was always — use that. That particular moment, I will never forget that. I
don’t know from where, I don’t know why, suddenly arri — arrived four Germans on
horses. White, beautiful horses. And on every horse was a general, a German
general. Not a Hakenkreuz, because some of them was Hakenkreuz, they were the
worst. No Hakenkreuz, just German uniform. Til today I don’t know who they
were. That was a miracle. And he said out — not chasen, out, out, out, not

schneiderin, and — and there’s was my father, my sister and my brother stayed on

in Rumbula. That is the — the name, Rumbula, where the killing was. And that, I
am the only witness alive, of today. The only. I will show you in the corridor, I have
a little memorial there. So, how chasen — my mom — so we stay — we’ll stay with
the officer. You know, every little thing maybe will be different. At least my mom
has both — both girls, you know. She was very happy. We are schneiderin and we
shall stay. So, there was a running other woman, other woman, and it was a group
with about 200, or 150, I really don’t remember. The people know each other from
a [indecipherable] shtetl, you know, you know each other. And so — so was, we
stayed there behind the four fe — horses, beautiful horses, I will never forget these
horses. And they — there — the uniform what the — the Germans has, was like
Wehrmacht. This is a different German, the kind of. No Hakenkreuz. I really
looked at that, it was no Hakenkreuz. They was Wehrmacht officers, but they was
officers, definitely big — big shots. So, when the group was about 150 already, we
moved. The other, they moved. He — we — he took it out of that. They basically save
us, kind of, in a way. So, he say, you follow me. This group goes on — this is the
other group. You come after me, we will go ahead. So the four horses went the
front, and we went under. We was tired, and hungry, but we went, because we

thought maybe this a good thing, maybe we’ ll work as schneiderin, and that’s very

went this way, we went this way. So we walk and walk and walk, and where we
walk, I am from Riga, I know every corner. It is the prison. It is Termin(ph) prison,
the name was Termin(ph), Termin(ph) prison, the name of the prison. The — the —
that the — how you call that? The prison [indecipherable] get up — you know, it is
from wood, such — with eyes that went up, and th-the — the horses and the people
were standing here, with all these 150 or 20, I don’t remember how many, went in
and — and this a [indecipherable] prison. I was never in prison, I didn’t know, but
you know, you know how a prison looks, yes. But the four — the — the — this — the
Germans on the four horses stayed outside. We never saw him. We never worked as
schneiderinin(ph). Til today, I kn-know that they saved our lives, because they
took us away from the [indecipherable]. Otherwise we — we stayed in the line,
because it were only lucky we — we stayed in the back. Otherwise, we would be
killed, like other people. So, now we’re in the pri-prison. What are we going to do,
150 people about, or 20, I don’t know. So, usually in a prison when you are, you get
your own kamera with a little whatever. No, the Jews didn’t get that. They took us
on — on top on the prison, with a open sky, and it was November, I remember that
