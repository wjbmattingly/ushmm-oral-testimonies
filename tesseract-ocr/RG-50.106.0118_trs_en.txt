gave Rumkowski a pla — places where to open houses for they took out the Jews, th-

little by little they took out every day, every day, every day they loo — took out from

world?
A: Nothing, we ca — five o’clock we had to go home. Five o’clock — after five you
couldn’t work. So we got only with the neighbors, but we got neighbors a few. We
were sitting and talking and — an-and planning, an-and — and praying, and we
believed we — we — we — th-that — th-th-that we will survive, yeah, but no — no — no —

childrens. So, you know, not — not everybody was giving out the childrens, so they
were sitting in the houses. So later the SS with the Jewish police came and they took
out the childrens from the houses. This I was hiding on a roof, so they didn’t came on
the roof.
Q: What did Rumkowski say to the people?
A: I can tell you, he was not a bad man, but he got to listen to the SS because he was
the alteste der Juden. The SS gots with him t-t-to deal, what to do, what di— so he
had to listen to them, if not, they would kill him. So he came out, he said we have to
give over the childrens.

going?

came to Auschwitz, I saw none. Here is the end.
