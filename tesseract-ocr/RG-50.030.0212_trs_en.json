The Jews had a curfew, by eight o'clock, nobody was allowed, but the...you know, there was a death sentence. If somebody was caught outside strolling around or wandering around, he was shot. There was no less punishment than that, but the non-Jews, the Christian population, had a right to go in and out from the ghetto at will. And we used to hear at night a truck coming in, and our heart used to pound and scared. And I remember this was a girl with me, a girl by the name of Zelda. She was a very talented girl.

We did not at the time, but now we understand that everything went to the front because it was very cold, till the day...and every day was terrible news coming into the ghetto. Nobody wanted to believe. We said \u201cWe are...we are good people. Why would they do it?\u201d And I remember there was one man who was sitting down there on the side and he said, \u201cOur time didn't come yet.\u201d I didn't like it at that time, whatever he said...yes.:09:34 And, and the day came. The day came. They surrounded our ghetto and it wasn't over. It was two weeks I remember before Rosh Hashanah. They surrounded our ghetto, police, because...police and Germans and the terrible news came in. We saw it right away that something horrible is happening. People start running. Bunches of people start running from one street to the other one. And...and the Ukrainian police, the collaborators of the Germans and the Germans used to fire at us like they were too smart and, and laugh like it would be some kind some kind of game, some kind of joke, some not real. My mother at that time in the...1n the late afternoon, my mother came up to me. She said, \u201cBrenda, you must go into hiding.\u201d I said \u201cWhy?\u201d I said. \u201cYou must go into hiding. There is a place at my uncle's house and, and at least one of us...we don't know what's going to happen. You have to go down there.\u201d I didn't want to in the beginning, but then she persisted and I went along with her plan. I went down there and if you want it I'll describe this the, the hiding place. Overnight I stayed down there and what did I find. It was in a barn. They lived right by the gate of the...by the...not by the gate but by the fence of the ghetto. A few jumped over the fence. You were over...over...out of the ghetto, out of the peri\u2014 the, the...whatever the ghetto was...was...the border. In this in this barn where they had a cow, there was a double...a double wall was erected and down there was underneath was a little opening. You just opened this thing. You went in and if you walked into the barn, you didn't know nothing, because people crawled in down there, and what did I find down there behind...behind. I find down there may be about eight to ten people was sitting, one next to the other. And especially I remember this old lady, this eighty year old lady, but she did not...maybe she was older...an old...a, a really old...and she...Mr. Lurja, Mrs. Lurja was her name. She was a very nice lady, and she didn't understand what it's all about. She was asking us questions. We didn't know no answers for her to give. \u201cWhat's going on? What's happening?\u201d And we lived through the night when we heard that the youth of the ghetto wanted to actually to burn the ghetto. If somebody tipped of the Germans that the ghetto, that, that that's the plan of some of the youth of the ghetto.

We went back into hiding and in the morning we send out the son of this old lady, Mr. Lurja. He was a very respectable, nice man. He was a business man. We sent him out to find out what's going on. When he went in into the town, into town, into the whatever, into the, the town the whatever everybody has been gathered. He came back running. He said, \u201cEverybody must go out from that from, from hiding. If anybody will be caught, they will be shot on the spot.\u201d At that time we didn't know the verdict was the same for the people who were hiding or the people who went down there. I for my part, I decided to leave and to go and meet up with my parents. I went. I met up with my parents, and I remember when we walked out from the house, and this is...this, is something that stands out in my mind, and there's the lady who closed the shutters across from us, from our house, and she said \u201cI hope my hands don't come back and open the shutters again.\u201d And we came to the...to the clearing...it was like a clearing, where everybody gathered up there. It was a big...right by the gate of the ghetto, and what did I find down then there? I find all, all the people, a lot of people gathered down there. My mother with our family. She had something in her hand, a little...some food, whatever not, and there was this German standing down there with a red face. He must have been drunk. It was early in the morning, about ten o'clock, and he had a list of names and calling them out alphabetically, and then putting them in groups, taking them behind the, the, the gate and there surrounded, they were surrounded right away by police, by Ukrainian police who were collaborators with the Germans and the Germans and they were taken away. If my name was Szyr, I was almost to the end to leave the ghetto, and then he, he called out names and who was not present he, he, he, he marked it off with a pencil. We didn't know at that time what, what, what was the reason, but then we find out. He wanted to find out how many Jews still remained and how many they have to still go after them. And there was this little boy. He was sitting...his parents are already taken. He was sitting and crying and the German was ready for him. He was ready with his pistol. We grabbed this little kid and we dragged him along with us, and we dragged him along in our group when we went and I remember this German with this arm band, and he had a white skeleton. They were the Sonderkommando .:15:46 \u00b0 special commando (German); Nazi units assigned to liquidate targeted populations, such as Jews, within the territory of the Soviet Union.

That was...when I came it was during in the day time. It was double barbed wired. It was in a valley not far from the school where I went to school, near, I remember, the church. The Catholic church was right on the hill standing, and in this valley, this was erected with three barracks, a toilet for men and for women in the middle, and there were Germans and Ukrainian, a German-Ukrainian. When we came down there, we saw already people were killed, laying by the...by the barbed wire, and we didn't know what it's all about, but then we find out first that they brought in all the people from the small towns, all surrounding Sarny.

From the big fire we run out. I ran to the first...my first instinct told me...and there was this, this nice German, and I must mention about him. There was one German who was standing with this gun against us and in this sea of hate, this was still a nice human being. He was not from the from, the from their party. He was one of the guys who they asked him to stand with the gun, and, and he stood down there. He was in his 50s, my father's age at that time, and I remember my friend, my girlfriend. I saw her at that time just for the first time. She went up close to him. He had the right...he had the right at that time to kill her, and I stood right behind her, and he grabbed his head. He said, \u201cOh my God, I have a daughter your age. What they are doing to you?\u201d And he yelled to us and he said, \u201cYou dummy Juden*. You dummy, run from here. They are going to kill you.\u201d But we knew already and that's why the plan when the barbed wire was cut, cut by that and then we ran out. We went...the first instant my mother saw me going behind the barbed wire, she threw my sister over, and she ran behind me. My first instinct was to go to a Christian family we knew over there. We were friends with them. And I remember, and this, is also a standout in my mind forever... went up from there to their house...it was not far. They could hear the shots. They could hear the yells even. I went up to them and I said, \u201cHide me.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I don't have -- I'm afraid.\u201d I could understand that. And then was a fenced in little yard. I opened this fenced in...the, the, the gate, and there was her husband with a whole bunch of Poles standing and telling jokes, and this is...1 wanted to make it a parallel. Their friends have been murdered. They are telling jokes and when they saw me and my sister standing down there, they covered, they stood, they, they got white in their faces and they saw the reality of the situation.:21:46 We went from there...we joined...we went over and it was easier now to, to explain than it was. I'm...I...I lost my sister. In the meantime I went over myself. I went to the village where my grandparents lived and I knew some of the peasant people who were very nice. My first thing was to go this neighbor. I went to the neighbor, and when I walked into this house of that neighbor, this Ukrainian neighbor, I find my sister in there, and I find my uncle. And this, is like a...like, you know, like fantasy, like, like, like a...but this what happened. How my sister wind up down there...she told me that she went with a whole group of, of my cousins. There are some other people who knew this that, that, that surrounding that village, and they told her this guy is a nice man, so go into this house, so she went in and then how we met. From that point...yes...from that point we went and we met up with Szymon's\u2019 group. We were down there for a little while when we stayed with this guy. Then I wore...I...he gave me some clothing of a Ukrainian...yeah, looked like a peasant girl, yes, and from there we went into the deep woods, into White Russia."

The village was on fire. Our partisans were retreating. My unit was coming out. My house where I was stationed in that village, was right -- I could see it from there when we came out from the woods from far away.

They used to come, for instance, if you had to occupy a village, they were the first ones to scout out and to see if nobody's down there from enemy, from enemies, or when we retreated, they used to look to if none of our partisans were left, mop out -- take out all of them. When he saw, saw me running up to the village and thought that I got crazy. And he ran up to me. He said, \u201cT'll kill you.\u201d He thought that I'm running to the Germans.

I grabbed my, my, my bullet belt, I put over my head.:34:59 I remember, and I went over the, over the clearing. It was a clearing there, and I went up into the woods. I pinched myself to see if I'm alive or it's just something -- if it's not real. When I came back to my unit and I met up with my with my general, with my group, they said, \u201cOh my God, you live a long life Brenda.\u201d You know, they could not believe it. My only explanation -- I could not figure out. They could see me. They saw me. They should sniper me down. My only explanation was at that time that I wore a uniform from a German pilot. I was on the horse. I had his -- even his, his, his little hat, cap, and I had a poncho. That's like for the weather, for rain, like you put -- the, the army people put them on and you tie up to here, during the Second World War. The kids now wearing it. It was in style but in different colors. When you -- when you lay down on the ground, you're camouflaged. You're a part of the ground.
