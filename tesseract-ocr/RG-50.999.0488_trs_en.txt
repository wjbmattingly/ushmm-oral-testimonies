>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson and | am the host of the Museum’s public program First
Person. Thank you for joining us. We are in our 15th year of First Person. Our First Person
today is Mr. Frank Liebermann, whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the
Louis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein
Foundation to whom we are grateful for their sponsorship. I'm pleased to let you know that
Mr. Louis Smith is here with us today.

[Applause]

Thank you, Louis.

First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share
with us their firsthand experiences associated with the Holocaust. Each guest serves as a
volunteer here at the Museum. Our program will continue twice weekly through mid-August.
The museum's web site, www.ushmm.org, provides information about our upcoming First
Person guests. Anyone interested in keeping in touch with the museum and its programs can
complete the Stay Connected card in your program today or speak with a representative at the
back of the theater when we finish our program. In doing so you will receive an electronic copy
of Frank Liebermann's biography so that you can remember and share his testimony after you
leave here today.

Frank Liebermann will share his First Person account of his experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows, there will be an opportunity

for you to ask Frank some questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about
to hear from Frank is one individual’s account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief
slide presentation to help with his introduction.

We begin with this photograph of Frank Liebermann. He was born in Gliwice,
Germany in 1929. He was the only child of Hans and Lotte Liebermann. On the left we see
Hans Liebermann and on the right we see Lotte and her granddaughter Joannie.

Both of Frank's parents’ families had lived in this part of Germany for several
generations. Frank is pictured with his paternal grandparents, Bernard and Jenny Liebermann.
Hitler came to power in 1933, and when Frank began school in 1935, Jewish students were
separated from the non-Jewish students and fear of anti-Semitic attacks became frequent.
Pictured here is Frank's first grade class on the first day of school. The cones they are holding
contain sweets to make school sweet. Frank is in the second row, the fourth from the right. |
don't know if you can see my cursor, but there we go.

In 1936, Frank's father was no longer able to practice medicine as a result of
anti-Jewish laws. In 1938, the family tried to obtain visas to come to the United States. Hans
traveled first and Frank and his mother followed a few months later in October of 1938. Here
we see Frank's mother's ticket for the ship they took to the United States.

The Liebermann family settled in Ohio and Frank went on to graduate from Western
Reserve, now Case Western Reserve University, in 1950 with a degree in chemistry. After
graduation Frank started a long and successful career in the textile industry in New York City.

In that same year he married Marianne, his wife of nearly 64 years. Frank worked in textile
manufacturing until 1992 when he and Marianne moved to the Washington, DC, area to be
closer to their children. Frank would last three months in retirement before going into the travel
business which he continues today, specializing in Europe and U.S. travel, including Alaska.
He just recently joined a new agency, Signature Travel, in Maryland.

Frank and Marianne have three children, two daughters and a son. Their daughters,
Nancy and Joan, live in this area and their son Jerry is in Seattle. They have five
grandchildren with the youngest about to turn 23. As Frank notes, are now gainfully employed.
His grandson is preparing for his Ph.D. in modern European history. Frank notes that Aaron is
motivated by the family's history. Frank, Aaron, and Aaron's sister Elissa went to Poland, the
Czech Republic, and Slovakia in 2013. They stopped in Gliwice, the city in which Frank was
born and is now part of Poland.

I'm glad to say Marianne and their close friends Tom and Peggy are here with us
today. Actually, Marianne wasn't able to make it. Tom and Peggy in the front row, good friends
of Frank and Marianne's.

Frank volunteers with the Museum's Visitor Services where you will find him
Thursday mornings. As part of his responsibilities, he speaks with various groups visiting the
Museum. He also has spoken to wounded veterans at the recently closed Walter Reed
Hospital.

With that | would like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Frank
Liebermann.

[Applause]

Thank you for joining us, Frank, and for your willingness to be our First Person. We
have so much for you to tell us in our hour. We'll start right away.

You told me that your earliest memories start in 1934 when you were 5 years old.
You also said of that time, that “all-in-all it was a good time” for your parents. Tell us why that
was so and what you can about your family and their life in Gliwice and about yourself in those
first years of your life.
>> Frank Liebermann: My father was an ear, nose, throat surgeon. We lived on the main
street, which is common in Europe because they had street car connections. Very few people
had cars at that time. We had an apartment in back of the office. One of the exciting things
that happened in 1934 is that we got a miniature convertible, literally miniature.
[Laughter]
Smaller than a VW. We used that to visit my grandparents, living about 50 miles in one
direction; the other ones about 20 miles further east. On my first trip, I'm told -- oh, | have to
say, horses were still used widely for making deliveries. And the first time | went to the country
and saw cows, | said, "What funny looking horses."

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: The fact that you had a car was unusual, that the family had a car; right?
>> Frank Liebermann: Definitely. It was not used -- my father took the street car to the
hospital. That was a better way of getting around. In fact, we were to walk about three blocks
to get to a garage because you couldn't park it anywhere.

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection

>> Bill Benson: And your father, as you mentioned, was a surgeon. Tell us a little bit about
your father's family business.
>> Frank Liebermann: You mean my mother's --
>> Bill Benson: I'm sorry. Your mother's family business. Yeah.
>> Frank Liebermann: In 1933, my mother's side of the family celebrated the 100th
Anniversary of their business in Germany where they had a wholesale leather business with a
tannery. When things started getting bad, they were one of those people who said, "Things
will blow over. We survived starvation during World War | by bartering. This, too, shall pass."
We were the only ones who got out.
>> Bill Benson: Frank, you started school in 1935, attending a public school. You told me that
recess was the most dangerous time for you. Can you say a little bit about that?
>> Frank Liebermann: We had to leave the building. The playground was divided between
boys on one side, girls on the other side. Our teachers stayed in the middle to try to give us
some protection. We had three classrooms within the school of what was a public school. In
fact, we got permission to arrive a little bit later and leave five minutes earlier so that we could
safely get away from the grounds in order not to be subject to being attacked.
>> Bill Benson: So Jewish kids had three classrooms in this large public school.
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: How large was the Jewish population in Gliwice?
>> Frank Liebermann: About 1,000 families.
>> Bill Benson: It was a major city.

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

NOT A VERBATIM RECORD

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection

>> Frank Liebermann: The city was about 120,000. So it was a pretty small proportion. The
Jewish population in Germany was about one half of one percent. So it was easy to target.
>> Bill Benson: Right. Frank, before we move on to the events that led up to your leaving
Germany, tell us a little bit about your mother.
>> Frank Liebermann: In what --
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about her from those early years. She met your father after he was
well established.
>> Frank Liebermann: Oh. They met through a friend at a fraternity social wnen she was 16
and waited until my father had finished his residency and specialty training. They got married
in 1928. She was 20.
>> Bill Benson: And then you were born, of course, a year later.
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: One more point about that time, about your family. | think you told me that
you could trace family living there in that area as far back as the 1700s. So your family had
been established for many, many years in this part of Germany.
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Back a couple of centuries. --
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes. In other words, really going way back, Jews were never allowed
to own land. They stayed in small cities and then gradually integrated after Napoleon, really,
who furthered integration. They felt very much part of the community. The Holocaust got
everybody totally unprepared.

>> Bill Benson: And leading up to that, in 1936, circumstances for your parents turn more
ominous, became more difficult if not dangerous. Tell us what was significant. What changed
in 1936?
>> Frank Liebermann: After World War | there was a war between partly England, France.
They kind of tried to fill in the vacuum between Russia and Germany. This is when
Czechoslovakia was established as part of the Austria Hungarian Empire, in other words, was
separated. Poland was established after having been dominated by foreign powers for very
many years. In order to protect the minorities because populations were mixing, there was a
treaty that for 50 years minorities would be protected on either side of the border. That treaty
was over in 19 -- treaty was over in 1936. So even though the Nazi laws started earlier in the
rest of Germany, the border area was relatively still minority-friendly and then lost those
protections very suddenly in 1936.
>> Bill Benson: Just because that treaty expired.
>> Frank Liebermann: Expired.
>> Bill Benson: In that same year, in 1936, your mother made a trip to Israel for a very specific
purpose. Tell us about her trip to Israel in ‘36.
>> Frank Liebermann: She went together with one of her brothers to explore whether -- if
there was a way of making a living. They came back with the realization that in Israel -- | think
there was one doctor for every 100 people and that doctors were becoming chicken farmers
because there's no way of making a living. And that kind of vetoed the idea of going to Israel.
The way we got to the United States was because my grandfather was a genealogist and he

found this relative.
>> Bill Benson: Before we turn to that, as your parents began trying to think of how they were
going to get out of Germany, Israel wasn't going to work, one of the memories you have is that
your parents told you that it was urgent for you to learn how to swim.
>> Frank Liebermann: They said there's a strong possibility that we'll take an ocean voyage.
The pool is going to close in July of 1936 with the end of the minority protection laws. It's
imperative that you learn how to swim before that. As it got close, my grandfather came with
me to the pool and said, "We are not going home until you take a test;" which, at that time,
required 20 minutes non-stop swimming or treading water.
>> Bill Benson: Was your grandfather able to go home?
>> Frank Liebermann: We went home with a certificate.
[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: During that time, 1936 and 1937, tell us about your father, how your father
was doing from a work standpoint with the anti-Semitic laws taking full effect.
>> Frank Liebermann: Well, he was an ear, nose, throat surgeon. He lost his hospital
privileges in 1936.
>> Bill Benson: So they were gone.
>> Frank Liebermann: They also had an SA. They were the brown shirts. There were two
kinds of Nazi front line organizations. The SA were pretty much the beer hall thugs, if | can
use that expression. The elite were the SS. And eventually the SS got rid of the SR, but they
were used pretty much until close to World War Il, and there was an SR, brown shirt, in front of

the office questioning anybody who wanted to go into the apartment house asking what their
business was and if they wanted to go to my father's office, they took their name and said if
you go in there, you'll have repercussions on your job. So it got pretty serious.
>> Bill Benson: So not only does he lose his hospital admitting privileges but the intimidation
was SO severe on his practice.

Frank, if you don't mind, I'm going to adjust your mic just a little bit if it's ok. See if
that makes any kind of difference at all. There we go.
>> Frank Liebermann: | can't tell.
>> Bill Benson: During -- so your father's business is obviously really suffered. How was he
able -- how was the family able to make ends meet during that period?
>> Frank Liebermann: We had to live frugally, off any savings that they had accumulated.
And eventually my mother's father and grandfather said, “Look, maybe you should move. I'll
support you.” Even though we had records of the business where the volume went down
between 1933 and 1938 when the business was confiscated from 100,000 to 20,000. So, in
other words, economic blockade was very substantial.

Also, by the way, bank accounts were frozen. You could only take enough money
that was deemed by the government as necessary for living. And it was strictly forbidden to
take any money out of the country.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about the little space for a garden that your parents rented.
>> Frank Liebermann: Since it was dangerous to go to any parks or any specified
playgrounds, outside of town they had what were known as gardens which they now have in

Brooklyn, by the way. They are parts where people in the neighborhood can grow fruits,
vegetables, whatever it was. But these were a little bit bigger so that these became our
supervised playgrounds. There were five families who participated. Everybody, the families,
took turns taking us there to see that it was relatively safe.
>> Bill Benson: That was the one little safe haven to go play as kids.

Your family didn't keep a kosher kitchen yet you shopped for meat at a kosher
establishment. Why was that?
>> Frank Liebermann: There were a thousand families. Some of them were religious. A lot of
them were not. But the people who kept kosher couldn't buy enough to keep the butcher in
business, so everybody used the kosher business in order to help the community.
>> Bill Benson: In January 1938, your father made a trip to the United States that became --
made it possible for him to move to the U.S. in June of that year. Tell us about his trip in
January and the events that led up to his leaving for the United States in June of 1938.
>> Frank Liebermann: As we got -- as we located the relatives that my grandfather found, my
father took a trip to New York and also had the family job of finding out if there were any other
relatives because on my mother's side there was a family -- one of the family married Michael
Gratz who became prominent during the revolutionary time in Philadelphia and founded a
college. Rebecca Gratz was pretty well-known, but she never married. And he looked at the
archives in Philadelphia. Her brother went west, which meant Louisville, Kentucky.
[Laughter]
At which there were no further records. So that part of the trip was unsuccessful. But he also

did register for the state boards in Ohio which passed half of all people taking the exams.
>> Bill Benson: State board for?
>> Frank Liebermann: For medicine. And then came back with an affidavit from the relative
who was located that we wouldn't be on welfare for one year. Now, the affidavit which was
used as a generic term committed you to get a number from the United States to apply for a
visa. The quota, by the way, for the United States at that time was 25,000 people from
Germany, limited pretty much to the proportion of the population as it existed in 1921.
>> Bill Benson: So the ability to get that visa under the quota was exceptionally difficult.
Your father, tell us about his attempts to get his visa and, particularly, if you don't mind, about
Fraulein Schmidt.
>> Frank Liebermann: We got a number in January when he applied. The quota -- we knew
that the quota had not been filled. He called a friend of his and said, "What can | do to
expedite my visa? After all, | can't work and we want to leave now that we have a chance."
They said, well, it would be a good idea -- the counsel has a secretary by the name of Fraulein
Schmidt. Fraulein means miss.
>> Bill Benson: And this was the U.S. Counsel's office.
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes. “Geta nice big box of candy.”
[Laughter]
Which he dutifully did. Another month passed. Nothing happened. And he called again. He
said: By the way, did you put 100 marks into that box of candy?” The second box with 100
marks got us an appointment for a physical. We got the visa in the middle of June. My father

booked the next available ship to leave for the United States. The visa was good for 120 days.

Every person had permission to take 10 marks out of the country. That in 1938,
currency values -- of the exchange was $2.50. That's probably about the equivalent of
about $40, $50 today.
>> Bill Benson: That was the limit?
>> Frank Liebermann: That was the limit of what you could take out because the bank
accounts were frozen.
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about your father leaving for the United States when he
finally did get the visas, he canceled the lease that he had on his medical office and that
prompted a visit from the Gestapo.
>> Frank Liebermann: Again, | mentioned frozen bank accounts. The equivalent of a lease
was that you took a mortgage -- you gave the landlord a mortgage. In other words, you gave
him a sum of money in safe keeping. And as long as he had that money, you were protected
in your apartment house, store, whatever it was. When he canceled it, he got -- the mortgage
was transferred to another bank where he had his account. Somebody at the landlord's bank
reported to the Gestapo that a large sum of money had been withdrawn from the bank and
they should check it out.

So the two Gestapo people came into the office and said, "You're under arrest." He
said, "For what?" Said, "We got a report that you withdrew that sum of money." And he said,
"It was transferred to my bank. Please, call the bank." Upon calling them he was fortunate
that the president of the bank came to the phone and confirmed that the money was there, and

they left. But that gets pretty scary.
>> Bill Benson: And moreover, that money was not available to your father.
>> Frank Liebermann: No.
>> Bill Benson: It was gone.
>> Frank Liebermann: No. For all practical -- a frozen bank account means that it's yours but
you can't do anything with it.
>> Bill Benson: Right.
>> Frank Liebermann: You can't take it out.
>> Bill Benson: So with the frozen bank account, with the equivalence of maybe $40, $50 in
today's money, as the money that he was allowed to take out of the country, how was he able
to figure out a way to finance his way to the United States and knowing that you and your
mother would remain behind for a period of time?
>> Frank Liebermann: At that time you could still use money to buy an ocean ticket. If you
bought -- if you went first class, you were able to get a fairly good spending allowance which is
supposed to be used on the boat; like you go on a Caribbean cruise. And they encourage that.
But at that time you were still able to take it out when you arrived in the United States. So
basically that's how he existed.

And that's the reason -- the visa was for 120 days. That means that if my mother
and | stayed in Germany until October, then we wouldn't have any expenses until he was
almost ready to take the state boards. At that time he had a room for $5 a week in Cleveland
while he was studying giving you an idea of this was still very much during the Depression.

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7

That also is part of the background.
>> Bill Benson: So, Frank, your father gets here. He starts studying for his boards. He's living
ina $5 a week place. You and your mother are still in Gliwice. You have a visa that's good
until sometime in October. Tell us what you know about how your mother was able to both
take care of you and her during that time and her preparation to get out before the visa
expired.
>> Frank Liebermann: Basically, at that time you could still pack your belongings providing
you pay 100% tax on everything that you take out. Among other things, she got a sewing
machine so that if necessary if she had to sew clothes, she could do that. It was taxed at the
full value, but the money had no meaning. So we did get out quite a bit of our furniture. They
had that furniture until they died.
>> Bill Benson: That she was able to get out. During that time -- go ahead. I'm sorry.
>> Frank Liebermann: | was going to say, in September we got a barrage of telegrams.
“Please get an earlier ship." We had no idea what it was because censorship was absolute.
There was no free press. It was a capital crime to listen to outside radio stations. We had no
idea whatsoever what it was about. Furthermore, when we -- we weren't able to get any
earlier ship. When we finally did get to the boat in Bremerhaven, there was no ship.
>> Bill Benson: The one that you were scheduled to leave on.
>> Frank Liebermann: The one that we were scheduled to leave on. And we only found out
what happened once we were on the ship. During this time you had Munich where Daladier of
France and Chamberlain of England negotiated with Hitler for peace in our time by giving away

a large part of the Czech Republic without their knowledge or authorization. And that changed
the balance of power in Europe because the potential allies lost 14 divisions at Germany's
under belly.

During that time Hitler threatened the allies or what became the allies by calling back
all of the ships at sea and saying that if | don't get what | want, I'm going to declare war. That
ship was called back from already the beginning of the Atlantic Ocean and lost four days
before all of that blew over.

The trip took six days.
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about that -- | do want you to tell us about that. While it was
just you and your mother preparing to go, during that time you broke your arm. | would like
you to share that, what happened.
>> Frank Liebermann: Ok. We were playing tag. | broke my arm. And that happens to have
been -- that was not in that garden. That was a place where | went with my bicycle, a little bit
out of town. You would normally call 911. My instincts told me that's not a good idea. | was
able to ride home with one arm. | got home. My mother called up the orthopedic surgeon in
town and said my son seems to have broken his arm, can you set it. He said, “No, | don't treat
Jewish children.” She frantically called other people that she knew, including the hometown of
my father where she located an orthopedist who said, “I'll take care of you, but here's what you
have to do. Take a taxi to Bolton, which was a town, and go to the back, in through the
backdoor, the freight entrance of the Catholic orphanage. I'll meet you there." He set my arm
at that time. He gave instructions to my mother that once it was out of the cast -- | think it was

supposed to be on for five weeks. How my pediatrician should treat it in order to get the
movement back.
>> Bill Benson: And, of course, the surgeons and the physicians that your mother had tried to
get had been essentially colleagues of your father.
>> Frank Liebermann: They were colleagues. They went to meetings together. But the
control that the Nazis got unbelievably fast is hard to imagine.
>> Bill Benson: So October 1938, shortly before your visa was expiring, aS you described, you
went through the scare of the ship not being there but you were able to get the ship eventually
and you made it to the United States. What do you remember about your trip across the
Atlantic.
>> Frank Liebermann: By the way, | will mention real quick. It took six days for the ship to
cross. Since the schedule was always seven days, it took four crossings in order to get back
on schedule. We were the fourth crossing. This is how we got to New York.
>> Bill Benson: And what was that trip like for you, the excitement of reuniting with your father
but also leaving behind what you were leaving behind?
>> Frank Liebermann: We had, by the way, the cheapest first class cabin which was right in
front of the bow. This was during hurricane season. | spent hours watching the bow literally
dive into the waves and then come up kind of with a jerk when the water was off. My mother
never left the cabin. She pretty much had a breakdown.

On one day there were only six people in the first class dining. The other five were
in the captain's table. | had a little table all for myself.

>> Bill Benson: So you make it to the United States. You go to Cleveland. You're reunited
with your father. What was that like for you? Do you remember?
>> Frank Liebermann: It was happy that we got together, especially when we found out about
Munich. And what he was trying to do to get us there. He had rented a one-bedroom
apartment in this Cleveland. He had another month and a half of the state boards, which, by
the way, he fortunately passed on the first try.

lt went pretty smoothly from that point of view with one big exception. My parents
went to a movie the first time. | think they had a Wednesday special, something like -- | don't
know if it was 10 or 25 cents. And they asked a neighbor to look in on me. That was their first
time out. At about 9:00 the telephone rang. My grandparents called that this was
Kristallnacht; that my mother's brothers had been arrested, the business had been confiscated,
what can they possibly do to help. Obviously he wasn't able to give an affidavit to anybody
because there was no money.
>> Bill Benson: He couldn't guarantee their financial --
>> Frank Liebermann: He couldn't guarantee their financial -- their finances. So he took the
next bus to New York for the gentleman who gave us an affidavit. A little bit of background, his
father had gone to my great grandfather in 1905 saying that he urgently needs | think $3,000
or $5,000, which is a very substantial amount of money for a week. Because he was in
trouble. He never heard from his father again. He took that money, came to the United States
to establish himself. He did give my father the visa, but when he came back he said, "I can't
take any more responsibility." Obviously this was too close. He turned it down. We weren't

the movie, you were home and got the call.

remember. 9:00 for them is 3:00 in the morning. | knew something was wrong. At that time
you don't know about person-to-person calls.
>> Bill Benson: Right.
>> Frank Liebermann: They came back at about 10:00. That's when we got all the details.
>> Bill Benson: And that night happened to be, as you said, Kristallnacht, what we call Night
of Broken Glass.
>> Frank Liebermann: Night of Broken Glass.
>> Bill Benson: November 9 through 10, 1938.

Frank, several other things I'd love for you to tell us about before we close in a little
while. We still have some time. You, of course, as you said, were able to bring some
belongings out of Germany that you had to pay 100% tax on it. One of those items was a
bicycle. Will you tell us about the unpacking of the bicycle?
>> Frank Liebermann: My parents had friends -- at this point I'll say acquaintances.
>> Bill Benson: At that time friends.
>> Frank Liebermann: Who had a bicycle and motorcycle shop. They said, you know, it would
probably be helpful if we put them -- put Frank's bicycle into one of these packing boxes; that it
takes as little room as possible in the lift. That's -- very similar to what is now called the

container. So she said fine. | took the bicycle over there. They brought it back. It was
packed. And when we got to the United States, we got a letter. | don't know exactly at what
time but when they knew that we had our date and address. They said that when you unpack

My father was livid. It was well packed. There were black cloths over it. But that
could have cost me and my mother our lives for a lousy few gold pieces.
>> Bill Benson: So used you to smuggle those out of the country unknowingly.
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: After your father passed his boards, you moved, | believe, to Dayton.
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Your father wanted to establish himself there. Will you tell us that story about
getting himself established in Dayton?
>> Frank Liebermann: He moved to Dayton because there were no Jewish ear, nose, throat
surgeons. It was a recommendation of a school friend who lived in Cleveland, by the way, and
had an office -- shared an office with an ear, nose, throat surgeon. So he was pretty anxious
to get us out of town. But it was a very good move in this retrospect.
| said he passed his exam. He opened an office, found an apartment; opened an
office on Valentine's Day 1939. He promptly applied for membership in the Medical Society,
which was kind of a license to be -- license to legitimacy. He didn't hear anything for a couple

of weeks and then found out that there was an emergency meeting on a Friday night in which
the Medical Society of Dayton passed a law an ex post facto, urgency, requiring citizenship for
membership in the Medical Society. The vote was 51-50. Somebody did get upset about it
without their knowledge.

The next day he got a call from a reporter of "The Dayton Herald." “Doctor, do you
have time? Can! see you? | need to ask you a few questions.” He came over to his office
and asked for his documents, where he studied, his medical credentials, and said "Thank you
very much" and left. The next day "The Dayton Herald" had an editorial, "Freedom of
Opportunity in the United States." The following Monday he had 11 new patients.

One of my favorite sayings is, “If you get a lemon, make lemonade.”
>> Bill Benson: Mm-hmm.
>> Frank Liebermann: And what was meant to be benign really established him.

By the way, in ‘41, he volunteered for the Army and was rejected because Dayton
practically doubled in size during that time. They didn't want any doctors over 40 and were
looking for younger men. There was a severe shortage of doctors. But he did volunteer twice
a day giving physicals for the boards.
>> Bill Benson: And staying about your father, as you mentioned a little while ago, Frank,
when he learned about what happened on kKristallnacht, he went to New York to try to see if he
could help. He couldn't. But that did not stop his efforts to rescue people from Europe. Tell us
about that.
>> Frank Liebermann: He became very active in what is known as the International -- a

Jewish resettlement organization. In the ‘60s, he received the international HIAS, international
award of merit, together with President Truman for efforts in rehabilitating refugees from World
War Il.
>> Bill Benson: In fact, he personally was responsible for well over 100 refugees.
>> Frank Liebermann: 107, which he gave affidavits to.
>> Bill Benson: Personally.
>> Frank Liebermann: To guarantee that they would not be wards of the state.
>> Bill Benson: Personal affidavits for 107 people.
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Wow.
Frank, from what you know about what happened to the rest of your extended
family, tell us what you know.
>> Frank Liebermann: My mother's -- two of my mother's brothers got visas for Shanghai and
booked on an Italian boat. There were two countries which gave refuge: Shanghai, occupied
by Japan, and the Dominican Republic. The rest of the world was pretty much closed. They
were on the ship on the day that Italy declared war on England and France after the fall of the
marginal line in 1940. The ship went back and we never heard anything from them again.
| did finally get closure. The Germans kept meticulous records; which, by the way,
the Holocaust Museum was instrumental in digitalizing. We found that my grandparents were
at sea until they were deported to Auschwitz. My mother's brothers were all in Auschwitz labor
camps. And you saw records that they were treated for Typhus. When they came for

treatment, call it the medical office, they were gassed.
>> Bill Benson: And you personally have seen records.
>> Frank Liebermann: I've seen papers about it.
>> Bill Benson: You returned to Gliwice.
>> Frank Liebermann: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: What was that like for you?
>> Frank Liebermann: I've made peace with Germany. | remember one -- it's three
generations. Particularly the people who come here, basically, do it because they can't right a
wrong, but Germany is probably owned up to the Holocaust better than any other country in
Europe, possibly with exception of Denmark.

So | decided -- | went hiking with my grandchildren last year. | had gone -- oh, about
12 years ago, Gliwice, the town created a memorial to the contribution of the Jewish
community to the growth of the city. Because the Pols were trying to recreate their history.
Coal was discovered in that area. It was owned really by the gentries during that time. That
area was kind of a no-man's land partly belonging to Germany and to Poland. So the land of
gentry didn't want to get their hands dirty and leased the land to entrepreneurs, a large number
of whom were Jewish who started the coal mines and the industrial hub of Silesia. We were
invited by the city of Gliwice for the opening of the memorial, which, by the way, had the
ambassador -- the Israeli ambassador, the ambassador -- one of the ministers from Poland,
and the German ambassador.

becomes very fragile. This is what happens. That's what makes the Museum very timely even
today. Because there are a lot of bad times.

So | went hiking with my grandchildren. There's a beautiful mountain range between
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and then we ended up in Krakow and Warsaw. And on
the way, we stopped off in Gliwice, which is now a thriving university town. | Know the house
even though the street names are all different, street numbers are different. | couldn't go near
it. Because of the fear the right of return. But | wanted to show my grandchildren, wanted to
know where we came from. | had a wonderful time, a unique time, to spend with them.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Frank.

I'm going to turn back to Frank in a moment to close our program. Obviously we
could have spent a lot more time not only hearing more details about what Frank's told us but
also some of the adjustment of the family once they had moved to the United States.

We thank you for being here with us for what we were able to hear from Frank today.
| remind you that we will have programs twice weekly through the middle of August. The
Museum's website will provide information about First Person in 2015.

It's our tradition here at First Person that our First Person gets the last words. So I'm
going to turn back to Frank for his last word. Two comments before | do so. One, because we
didn't have a chance for question and answer with you, when Frank's done, he'll step off the
stage. If anybody would like to ask him a question or shake his hand or take a photograph,
whatever you would like to do, please, absolutely feel free to do that. And secondly when
Frank is done, our photographer, Joel, over to my left is going to come on the stage. He'll take

a photograph of Frank with you as the backdrop. I'm going to signal to you to stand if you don't
mind and if you would do that, we'll get this terrific photograph of Frank with you providing a
great backdrop to that.
On that note, I'd like to turn back to Frank.
>> Frank Liebermann: | want to refer to my trip with my grandchildren. We were back in
Gliwice. | kind of pinched myself that if it hadn't been for international events, | couldn't
possibly imagine myself being part of that. With all that happened | feel wonderfully fortunate
I've lived the American dream. I've got three children, five grandchildren, and all good things
to be grateful for. | wish the same for all of you.
