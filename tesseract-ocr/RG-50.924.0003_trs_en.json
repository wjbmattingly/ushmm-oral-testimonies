It was maybe like if television would be on at the time maybe people would know more and get more involved and maybe these tragedies wouldn\u2019t happen. People would speak up. But...so they quest [sic] mostly about our life and they taught us a lot about American life. I feel that we were more Americanized because of them than other survivors who mostly survivors stay together with other survivors and we got more Americanized and our friends were Americans and so on. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 18 HELEN LUKSENBURG page 3"

He was by streetcar like a half an hour away in a smaller town there and I knew he\u2019s cousins. So I\u2019d mentioned once to his cousin\u2014that was during the war. I was 14-15 years old, a teenager, and/that she https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 21 HELEN LUKSENBURG page 38 should introduce me and she never did. So one guy who worked in our factory went to work where he was working. So I said to Joe I said, Bring him over. One day he comes with him and he brings him to my machine and my cousin was sitting across like you are sitting and she said\u2014and he/we started to giggle. We were girls and we started to giggle. He remembers two young girls giggling. That\u2019s all what he remembers. He...mind wasn\u2019t clear at that time. He just lost his parents and he was homeless. He had to give up his own room and people moved in because he was a single person. He wasn\u2019t entitled to a room and [EXHALES] so that was the end. I come to the camp and who do I see through the fence he 1s in that camp but I didn\u2019t approach him or anything. Once we...didn\u2019t have water in our bathroom so it was a backdoor from the men\u2019s\u2014 We were divided by fence. The mens [men] was a thousand men and 600 women. They were building the factories and we were working in them. As soon as one was finished, we operated it.

And he was...Sleep on his pants because it was important that the...stripes have a...crease in them and never took off that little cap. He was ashamed because that head, hair was shaven. A couple days later our barrack was the first barrack by the fence. Somebody comes to the barrack and says, Somebody wants to talk to you by the fence. I go out. Here\u2019s that and started to talk with me, nothing could go on. And from that time on he used to come to the fence and we\u2019d talked. And one day I was by the fence talking to him and I didn\u2019t notice that was a German officer up the hill watching us. He came around into the barrack and the German came in. And he said, / counted five people by the fence. If these five people don\u2019t come up every other fifth person will have their hair shaven. There were women 30 years old. I was at https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape 21 HELEN LUKSENBURG page 39 the time 17 years old who never spoke to a man and I...always felt very responsible person and I came forward. Why should people who never even were there and never talked to a man be punished because I had a rendezvous. So I came forward because I was such a brave Jew. He took me by the neck, rouse, and pushed me out. Nobody else came/followed me so I run into the next room and cry, wanted to go back. Why should innocent people be punished for my foolishness? She didn\u2019t let me. She was sleeping after nightshift there and she said, You admitted it. Why should you go back? The next morning the comradeship was so great that not the men were watching us who to tell whose head/hair was shaved. They couldn\u2019t tell. We had little triangles, black triangles, purposely to put on like a turban that because the soot, the black stuff, doesn\u2019t get into our hair when we were working. So everybody took the...people who had their head shaven made a little lock outside and everybody was wearing a turban that you couldn\u2019t tell who...head was shaven or...who was. The comradeship, we were each other\u2019s and still remain like related like family because we were thrown together. Everybody was in the same situation, everybody lost everybody, [EMOTIONAL] the whole family, so it was very important the comradeship to us."
