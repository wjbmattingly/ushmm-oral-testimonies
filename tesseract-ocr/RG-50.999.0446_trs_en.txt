>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon, and welcome to the United
States Holocaust Memorial Museum. My name is Bill Benson and
| am the host of the museum's public program, First Person.
Thank you for joining us today. We are in our 14th year of First
Person. Our First Person today is Mrs. Susan Warsinger, whom
we shall meet shortly.

This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through
the generosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation, to whom
we are grateful for again sponsoring First Person. | would like you
to know that Mr. Louis Smith is here with us today. Right there.
Thank you, Louis.

First Person is a series of conversations with survivors of
the Holocaust who share with us their firsthand accounts of their
experience during the Holocaust. Each guest serves as a
volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue through
mid August. The museum's website at www.ushmm.org provides
information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.

Susan Warsinger will share with us her First Person account
of her experience during the Holocaust and as a survivor, for
about 45 minutes. If we have time toward the end of our program,

we'll have an opportunity for you to ask Susan a few questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the
decades. What you are about to hear from Susan is one
individual's account of the Holocaust.

We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her
introduction.

Susi Hilsenrath was born in Bad Kreuznach, Germany. She
was the eldest of three children. Here we see Susan's family.
From left to right is her brother Joseph, mother Ani with * in her
lap, her father Israel, and Susan with her arm around her father.

Here we see Susan and her brother Joseph.

On November 9-10, 1938, known as Kristallnacht, or Night
of Broken Glass, Nazi thugs smashed the windows and
furnishings of the Hilsenrath family's home. Months later, Susan
and Joseph were smuggled to France.

In May 1940, the German Army invaded France. Susan and
Joseph were evacuated from a children's home in Paris to
Versailles, where they were temporarily housed in Louie XIV's
palace. Soon German soldiers arrived and the children fled with
their guardians to the unoccupied part of the country under the

Vichy government.

The arrows indicate their movement southward.

With the help of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Susan
and Joseph received permission to immigrate to the United
States. Information written on this tag that Susan wore identifies
her name and states she is sailing for the United States on the SS
Serpa Pinto.

After crossing the Pyrenees to Spain, the two children sailed
to Lisbon, Portugal, and arrived in New York in September 1941.
Susan and her brother Joseph are highlighted here on this
photograph from a newspaper. Susan lives here in the
Washington, DC area. She has three very accomplished
daughters, and as she notes nine wonderful grandchildren. She
spent 29 years as an educator in the public school system.

Susan's volunteer work at the museum includes being
a member of the Museum's Speakers' Bureau. She is also a â€œ
two guide leading law enforcement officers, including FBI agents
and law enforcement officers from all over the United States and
from throughout the world through the museum's permanent
exhibit. She gives tours to special groups such as college-aged

leaders and individual tours to visually and hearing impaired
people. During the summers, Susan participates in the museum's
program Conversations in the Wexner Center, where she
welcomes questions and conversation in an intimate setting as
she discusses her experience during the Holocaust. Susan is
also giving tours for the museum's new exhibit, Some Were
Neighbors: Collaboration and Complicity in the Holocaust. And
she is a member of the writing workshop for survivors here at the
museum. You can read some of Susan's writings online on the
museum's website.

With that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First
Person, Mrs. Susan Warsinger.

[Applause]

Susan, thank you so much for joining us, for being willing to
be our First Person today. We have just an hour. You have so
much to share. Weill start right away. Why don't we begin with
you telling us about your early years, those years before
Kristallnacht, those years before the war, about your family, your
community, your own life in those early years.

>> Susan Warsinger: Well, many changes happened in my family
after the Nazis came into power. |'m going to tell you all of these
stories from a child's point of view, because that's the way |
remember it. So you will just have to bear with me if | get to be a
little bit childish every once in a while.

| remember we moved a lot. We lived, had lived in a very
nice house. All of a sudden, we didn't live in a spacious house
anymore. It seemed to me like we were always moving from one
abode to another, which was on an economic level.
>> Bill Benson: With each move?
>> Susan Warsinger: With each move. What happened was my
father had a thriving linen store and all of a sudden he didn't have
it anymore. He was boycotted. How many of you have been to
the permanent exhibit? If you remember, there's this one big
exhibit with an SA man standing in front of a store, and he is
saying, "Buy only in German shops, buy only from German
people," as if we were not German people. So my father lost --
can you hear me when I'm talking this way or do you want me --

he had to go to a farm to sell strawberries and cherries to the
people who were in our town. That's how he had to make his
living.
>> Bill Benson: | remember you telling me that when he would
come home after he was forced to go and sell cherries and
strawberries, that you Knew when he had been able to sell a few
by just the look on his face. | think you said he was smiling when
he'd come back, you knew he had been successful that particular
day.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah, yeah. We had some special signal, |
remember between us. | remember, | don't know, maybe it was
how many baskets he sold or something. It was just a private
thing | had with my father that | remember.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about the town. What kind of town was it?
Was it a small town?
>> Susan Warsinger: Bad Kreuznach is a spa. It's a place where
people come to recuperate from all kinds of illnesses. A lot of
people come there for pleasure, because It's a beautiful town. It

living there. And then --
>> Bill Benson: Your family had been there for a long time?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah, my parents got married there.
>> Bill Benson: How large was your family? Your extended
family.
>> Susan Warsinger: Well, we had a lot of relatives that were
living in Germany. I'll tell you at the end. The only ones that
survived was my family, my immediate family.
>> Bill Benson: It was a large extended family?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes. All of those didn't make it out.
>> Bill Benson: What about your schooling in those early years?

really not very happy years for you.

public school anymore.
>> Bill Benson: And then what happened?
>> Susan Warsinger: Well, we had numerous Jewish families in
our town, so the Jewish families hired one teacher, and they hired
one room, and this particular teacher had to teach the kids from
first grade to 10th grade, all in this room. One grade sat in this
row, the second grade. We had 10 rows and he had to teach us
all of the subjects.

| tell you, we did OK. We learned a lot. We learned a lot
from each other.
>> Bill Benson: And it was happier?
>> Susan Warsinger: It was.
>> Bill Benson: You shared with me an incident where your
mother had sent you to get bread, and you had to go through a
park.

me to go to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread. So | felt very
proud of myself, because | was the one that was providing
nutrition to my family.

of the auditorium. In order to get to the grocery store, | had to

couldn't figure out why | couldn't go through the park. | went
home to my mother and | told her. She said, "Well, just walk
around the park to get there, walk this way, that way, go all the
way around."

So the next time she gave me the money to go to buy
something, maybe it was milk, so | got to the steps of the park,
and | said to myself, | was very tired, so | thought, well, maybe |
would cut through, because | just didn't want to take all the way
around. So | went through the park, and the caretaker came, and
he started to throw rocks at me, and he started to say horrible

That wasn't the worst part. The worst part of my
remembrance is he had a young girl who was just about my age,
and she saw her father doing what he was doing, and he was her
role model. So she copied what he was doing, and she kept on
throwing rocks at me, calling me a dirty Jew and all kinds of other
things.

So | would never walk through that park again.
>> Bill Benson: Susan, in 1938 your mother had another child, |
think your brother Joseph. She had no choice but to have him at
home. Why was that?
>> Susan Warsinger: Well, Jewish people weren't allowed to go
to the hospital. They had to have their baby at home. The picture
that you people saw before was my brother and |. We were sitting
on the steps, and we were sitting outside because my mother was
having a baby.

rabbi and his family. Tell us a little about that.
>> Susan Warsinger: OK. Is it OK with you? OK.

lt was a house, it was like an apartment house, it had like
four floors. On the first floor, my family occupied the first floor.
The rabbi lived on the second floor. A non-Jewish family lived on
the third floor. And on the fourth floor was an attic. Well, it was
one night my brother and | were very excited because the next
day it was going to be my mother's birthday, and it was November
9, 1938.

All of a sudden, these bricks, rocks were being thrown
through our window. My brother was a year younger than | am,
but he was the brave one. He went to the window, and he looked
outside, and he said to me that it was our neighbors that were
throwing the rocks and the bricks through the window. And he
said there are several policemen, and if you had gone upstairs to
see the civil policemen, they're wearing the big, funny hats,
wearing this blue unform. He was standing outside, like this, at
the edge of the crowd. He wasn't doing anything at all to stop the
people from throwing the bricks and rocks through the window.

SO we were very scared, my brother and | really were
scared. We started to walk across the hall to our parentsâ€™
bedroom, and just as we were doing that some people had
uprooted a telephone pole, and they smashed it through the front
door, and our front door was made out of glass. It was made out
of beautiful colored glass. They smashed through the front door,
and the glass was being strewn all over. So we ran to our
parentsâ€™ bedroom, and we said, "My goodness, what's
happening?"

They always tried to protect us, and they always never tried
to tell us what was happening. So my father said, "Well, let's just
go hide up in the attic."

So we went up to the attic, and the rabbi's family was
already there, but the rabbi wasn't there. We found out later that
the people who went through our apartment, they looted a lot of
our belongings. Also, when they got to the rabbi's apartment they
destroyed all of his artifacts and his books and much of his
furniture.

So we were hiding up in the attic. | looked out, there was
this little window and | looked out, and the rabbi was standing on

that you learned upstairs in the PE, they were holding him.
Another one came along and took ahold of him, cut off his beard
and sent him to jail.
>> Bill Benson: You saw that?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes, | did see that. | did.

So | went, | found out later that they didn't only do it to our
apartment, to the people in our building, but they did it to everyone
In our community. Not only did they do that to every Jewish family
in the community, but they did loot all of the Jewish stores that
were left that were selling to Jewish people, because nobody else
was buying from them. Also, they burnt down our synagogue.

Not only did they do that in our town of Bad Kreuznach, but they
did it all over Germany. That's why it's remembered as the Night
of Broken Glass, which is called Kristallnacht.
>> Bill Benson: November 9-10, your mother's birthday in 1938.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Hundreds of synagogues in Germany were
burned that night.

>> Bill Benson: Did you have any idea after that that it was
widespread, that that pogrom was everywhere in the country?
>> Susan Warsinger: No, | didn't know about it until much later.
>> Bill Benson: With the rabbi arrested, taken away, what about
your father?
>> Susan Warsinger: My father wasn't taken away. Now, let me
tell you why. My brother and | keep talking about it, and | should
have asked -- | mean my father has passed away, he's dead. |
can't ask him anymore. | should have asked him. But one of the
things that we think is either that he was, because he had been
born in Poland when he was a little kid, he came to Germany,
maybe because at that time the Nazis, the Germans were not at
war with Poland yet, because it was before they occupied Poland,
which was in 1939. Maybe because he played chess with the
chief of police. We talked about a third reason.
>> Bill Benson: Otherwise, thousands of Jewish men were
imprisoned on that night?
>> Susan Warsinger: Exactly. Exactly.

there?

>> Bill Benson: A few days.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Do you remember anything of that time, being in
that attic and you were with the rabbi's family, too?
>> Susan Warsinger: Since it was November, it had been the
apple-picking season, we had -- someone had gathered lots of
apples, piles of apples all over the attic. So we had plenty to eat,
because we kept eating apples all the time.

Then the kids, we played. We played all with them, we
made abacuses out of them -- abaci, sorry.
>> Bill Benson: Abaci?
>> Susan Warsinger: We made abaci out of them. We played all
kinds of games with the apples. We were innocent children. We
really didn't understand how serious it was. All | know is that
before the Night of Broken Glass, my father and mother used to
have discussions whether they wanted to leave Germany or not,
and my mother was always for it and my father said, "Oh, this is
going to blow over and everything is going to be all right."
>> Bill Benson: Hitler can't last?

>> Susan Warsinger: Yes, yes. But after the Night of Broken
Glass, nobody wanted to stay there anymore.
>> Bill Benson: That's when your parents made that very
profound decision to try to get out of Germany at that point?
>> Susan Warsinger: Right.
>> Bill Benson: After Kristallnacht when they made that decision,
what did your parents do?
>> Susan Warsinger: Well, my father realized that we have to get
out of Germany, and in order to come to the United States, this is
what everybody wanted to come to, is to come to the United
States, the land of democracy and freedom and where you could
be anything you wanted to be, you couldn't come to the United
States because the United States had a quota, and also every
country in the world had a quota, except for the Dominican
Republic.

So my father said, well, he found this woman who was a
French lady, and she had children of her own. She was willing to
do for all of the money that he had left, that he had saved up, she
was willing to smuggle my brother and me to France.

>> Susan Warsinger: Not the baby. The one looking out the
window.

you and your parents, they made the decision to let the two of you
go.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah. Yeah. | guess, for me, it was like a
big adventure. | didn't realize that | might never see them again.
But | think that it must have been a horror for my mother, who had
to send her children away.
>> Bill Benson: I'm sure everybody in this room can't imagine
what that would be like to send you away to another country.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah. | keep thinking about when | had my
three girls, | couldn't imagine sending them away and not knowing
what's going to happen to them.

Anyway, it turned out OK. So we went to France, and we
went on the train and we had to keep very quiet, because we were
supposed to be French children. So when we got to the border,

we pretended we were sleeping and everything turned out all
right. And we ended up in Paris.
>> Bill Benson: Was there an incident where German soldiers or
guards boarded the train?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: Do you remember anything about that?
>> Susan Warsinger: We were very scared. My brother
remembers that we were -- he was fast asleep. He thinks, this is
his -- we never asked our parents. He thinks that maybe she
drugged us so we would be fast asleep, so we wouldn't be able to
speak German, because she was worried that we would say
something in German and we wouldn't be her children. But! don't
know if that's correct or not.
>> Bill Benson: You got across the border.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Went to Paris. Once you're there with a French
lady who, in effect, smuggled you out of the country, what was
waiting for you in Paris?
>> Susan Warsinger: Well, my father had a third cousin, and he
lived in Place de la Vendome. He had a hotel. In those days

young.
>> Bill Benson: Single guy, right?
>> Susan Warsinger: Single guy.
Here he had these two children. My brother was very nervous.
Excuse the expression, he used to wet himself in the bed. He
was upset and anyway, so he, the cousin, had to go to work, he
left us in the room. He said, "You stay in the room until | come
back." Of course, my brother was very curious, and he was 7,
and he used to leave as soon as cousin -- he went on the Metro.
In those days the Metro was a big thing because it was the only
one besides in New York. So he went on the Metro. He went all
over Paris. He made sure that he came home.

to people. | want to thank the Quakers a lot for everything that
they did. They helped, and | think they paid for us to stay with this

We were not the only children. We were maybe 10 children
that were lost.

>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: It wasn't a happy place?

>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah, during the day we weren't allowed to
go into the house, and we had to eat in a cabin outside of the
house. She was French and her husband, she did the same thing
to her husband. She made him stay outside too.

| remember. The good part about her husband, he was eating
pon frietes. Those are French fries. That was the first time | ate
French fries, the most delicious thing | ever ate.
lt was unpleasant. She wouldn't let us go to the bathroom.
We had to go in a pot in the middle of the night. We weren't
allowed to use the bathroom. In the morning somebody had to go

>> Susan Warsinger: Well, in 1940, | guess, all of you know in
June of 1940 Hitler had declared that he was going to take over all
of Europe. He walked into Austria, then he said I'm going to take
over Europe. So he took over Czechoslovakia. He went into
Poland. So the next thing he did in 1940, which is June, the Nazis
were bombing, not Paris, but bombing all around. We could see
in our bedroom, we could see the bombs falling down from the
German planes. I'm sure you've seen them in the movies, the
airplanes. It looked like the Fourth of July. | remember.

brother and | were there. He remembers it very well. | don't know
why we were in Paris, not in that place. When they came walking
into Paris, a lot of Parisians were really scared, not only Jewish
people, but we called them, the German army, the Boche.
Everybody wanted to leave.

some people fraternized with the Nazis. But most
everybody did not. So they wanted to leave. | don't know if you
saw on the map, you see Paris here, and then just think of one of
these rectangles as France. Half of it was the occupied zone of
France, like half of that, and Paris is up here. It's the occupied
zone.

So then they made some kind of a treaty with the French,
and they said, well, the bottom part is going to be unoccupied, and
we were supposed to be free, but Petain was the president of that
part of France, and he was an ally, really, of the Nazis.

Anyway, so what everybody wanted to do was get to the
southern part of France. But before that, everybody wanted to get
out of Paris. So I'm going to ask the audience if they know what
beautiful town is right a little bit, 45 minutes west of Paris.

these Parisians. Where do you think they put us up? Somebody

>> Bill Benson: You're still on your way to Vichy, France?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah, yeah.
>> Bill Benson: Where did you go from there?
>> Susan Warsinger: OK, we went to a place called -- a small
town near Vichy, they had a chateau, an old castle. It was all
Jewish children there. We knew it was not safe to stay in the
occupied zone in Brout-Vernet. It was in the occupied zone, but it
would be safer to stay in the occupied zone. We ended up in the
Chateau des Morelles in Brout-Vernet. There we went with a
whole bunch of children. We went to school in the village, but we
weren't allowed to go to this school in the village with the kids who
lived in the village because -- and they were all farmers. These
kids were all farmers. They didn't want us to rub elbows with their
children. So we had, again, a school of our own, and we had a
French teacher who taught us and who was very good to us.

| went back to France when | was an adult, | found out that
this teacher we had was the mayor of a little town around there.
SO anyway, he was a very nice person, and he did teach us,
taught us how to write and conjugate and history. Things were
OK.

operating more or less like an orphanage at that point?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: With a number of other Jewish children.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Besides the fella who was the mayor, who was
running that place?
>> Susan Warsinger: Oh, a person -- who was running it? Well,
Jewish people were running it.
>> Bill Benson: They were running it, OK.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes. Everybody was really scared,
because people started to find out what the Nazis had planned
out. By that time, | think they were thinking of the Final Solution,
and they knew that eventually they were going to take all of the
people and put them in the concentration camps. They started to
take the people in the occupied zone. In fact you will learn in the
other exhibit that | will tell you about a little bit later, that they
rounded up 35,000 people and they put them into this big arena,

Thank you for bringing me back. In the Eiffel Tower, and like
3500 policemen rounded them all up, and they all sent them to the
concentration camps. They were eventually going to do that in
the unoccupied zone too.

In the meantime, we wanted to be back with our parents,
and we didn't know what had happened to them.
>> Bill Benson: Did you have any contact with them at all once
you had left them?
>> Susan Warsinger: No.

was meager existence there.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah.

celebrating your birthdays while you were there. Will you tell us
that?

>> Susan Warsinger: We got dessert maybe once a week, twice
a week, and what we did is if we knew somebody's birthday was
coming, the friends and the relatives, let's say it was my brother's
birthday, | and some of my friends and his friends saved their
desserts, desserts from their dinners, and we went and hid them.
We had these lockers, like you have in high school, we had these
lockers in the attic. Every kid had their own little locker.

So we hid the desserts up in the locker and saved it up and
saved it up, and when it was time for the person's birthday one of
us went to the kitchen and got one of those -- and got one of
those brown trays. We tried to design it with doilies and
somebody picked flowers and put it on the tray. Everybody
brought their stash, and when it was the morning of the birthday
we used to go to their room and put it -- we were in this big
dormitory, but we went to their bed and put the tray on their bed
and sang to them.

We didn't know "Happy birthday." It was different.
>> Bill Benson: That's very touching that the kids, you found a
way to celebrate and be as normal as you could.

probably that is a way to survive, because you have love, and

>> Bill Benson: Here you are with your brother in this home in
southern France. Essentially, one day you find out your parents
want to come get you. They want to get you out of there. Tell us
about that.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah. Sometimes the children in the home,
they got word from their parents where they were, and they got
them out, wherever they were, in England or Italy or whatever.
They got them out. So my brother and | always prayed maybe
that would happen to us.

So one day the director, which was a lady, the director, she
called me up to her office. Well, of course, she only called
anybody up to the office if they were bad, and so | couldn't
imagine why she was calling me, because | was such a
goody-good.

glasses, she looked at me, she said, "Suzanne." That's what they

| came to the United States | wanted to be very sophisticated, so |
changed it to Susan. This was a long time ago

Anyway, she said, "We have heard from your parents, and
they are in the United States, and they have found you here."
This organization called HIAS and the Quakers all have been
working. All these organizations that we give money to and
donate money, they really do wonderful things, they found us. My
father sent tickets, and we came to the United States.
>> Bill Benson: Before you tell us about getting to the United
States, how did your parents get out of Germany and make it to
the United States?
>> Susan Warsinger: OK. My father had a cousin, who had a
pickle factory in Brooklyn, and they knew about our plight, so
somehow or other, you know, the United States didn't want to
raise their quota because we were going to be an economic
burden to our society, and we were going to take away
everybody's job.

So she promised that she was not going to let my father be
a burden to the United States. She was going to hire him, make

So he got his affidavit. It was really lucky, because after that

not many people got out of Germany.
>> Bill Benson: Right, because the war is already well on at that
point.
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes. Before the Night of Broken Glass, all
the Nazis wanted to do was get the Jews out of Europe, just tell
them to leave and they said to the rest of the world, "Go take
them," and the rest of the world just shut their eyes. But after the
Night of Broken Glass, there wasn't anyplace to go, so not many
people were able to get out of Germany. So my father was lucky.
>> Bill Benson: But your father went first by himself?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes, because he couldn't get an affidavit for
his wife and the baby. He came here --
>> Bill Benson: Your mother and youngest brother are still in
Germany at that point?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes. Yes. Then he got my mother and the
baby out. | guess, again, | did not ask enough of my father and
mother how all of this happened. That's why I'm giving you

questions or ask your parents, so that later on after they have
passed away you know all of the history. The thing is, after we
came to the United States, you know, nobody really -- I'm
changing the topic but | think it fits in well.
>> Bill Benson: It fits in.
>> Susan Warsinger: Nobody really wanted to talk about it.
Everybody put it under the rug. The Jews didn't want to talk about
It, because it was such a horrible experience. The Germans didn't
want to talk about it, because they were the perpetrators. The
rest of the world didn't want to talk about it, because they didn't do
anything. So everything was under the rug.

It wasn't until like 1993, like when this museum was built, is
when the Jews were coming out. The thing is why are they doing
all of this? Why are we talking so much about the Holocaust? It
had nothing to do with you, nothing to do with you or you, but it
does, because we have to -- well, I'll talk about it later.
>> Bill Benson: Susan, you now know that your parents, they're
alive, they're in the United States, they're sending tickets so you
can get out of there. How did you get to the United States?

at that time. At that time, a lot of boats left from Lisbon.

Pinto. There were 50 children allowed into the United States.
Somehow or other they had found passage to get here. It was not
like a grand cruise ship the way we have now. It was a cruise
ship, but it was small, because they didn't have the big ones. We

know what kind of --
>> Bill Benson: A Portuguese ship?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yes. It was Portuguese. But they were
Americans on this ship. | don't know. We never talked to them.

Anyway, so we had to be in the hull at the front of the ship,
and we were in the hull, and all 50 of us were in this one room.
We had bunk beds and -- well, my brother is going to get mad at
me if | tell you this.
>> Bill Benson: You got to tell though.
>> Susan Warsinger: So he was -- | was sleeping on the bottom,
he was sleeping on the top. | don't think anybody was on the third
bunk. He had always been nervous, because he used to wet his
bed. So this is -- we switched, | got on top, he got on the bottom.
I'm telling you this for a reason. He found a stash of pineapple
that the boat was carrying. It was not too far from where we were,
where the room was, and we had never eaten any pineapple
before in our entire life. He felt that that was the most delicious
thing. So he kept on eating pineapple and pineapple, until he got
really sick on the boat. The boat ride was 14 days. The boat kept

going up and down, up and down, and sometimes the insides of
his abdomen came swishing over the railing of the boat into the
deep waves. He was sick a lot.

So then he went and he wet his bed, and he got arash. A
rash all over his torso, from here to here. It was really serious, but
nobody did anything about it. I'm just telling you this for a reason.

So 14 days were up, and they said it's 6:00 in the morning,
we were going to see the Statue of Liberty. So we were all very
excited. My brother was already up there the whole night waiting
for it to come. So we got up there, maybe a little bit before 6:00.
There was a fog. You could not see your hand in front of your
face. It was so terrible. It was really terrible, and we were all very
upset.

We stayed up there. I'm telling you, I'm not making this up,
at 6:00, at exactly 6:00, the fog rose just like the curtain in the
theater or when you go to the opera, the curtain rose and there
was the Statue of Liberty, right next to us. It was the most exciting
experience that | can remember from that time.

So we got to New York, and they had a doctor, doctors
came onboard to check us out. All of the other people got off. All

the doctors came -- no, two doctors. Maybe three, | don't know.
They came onboard, and they checked out. They checked to see
if we had some kind of infectious disease. So they got to my
brother, and they said, "This person has some kind of disease that
we do not understand what it's all about." So they said, "You can't
come into the United States."

So where do you think they put him? Ellis Island is right.

You guys are so smart.

[Laughter]

They said, "You have to go to Ellis Island." Of course, | wouldn't
let him go by himself. | went with him.

>> Bill Benson: Your parents are on shore somewhere?

>> Susan Warsinger: Yes, my father. And so | guess he found

out what was going on. So we went to Ellis Island and | tried to

explain to them what it was. | had tried to explain to the doctors
what it was, but they wouldn't listen to me.

So that was the best place | had been in a long time, Ellis
Island. | tell you. We sat on these long tables, and on the tables
there were these round plates with stacks of white bread. It was
this high, and they had like six or seven slices. You could eat as

much as you want. If you wanted to hold one in your hand, you
could take it and you could squish it up in your hand and make a
little ball out of it. We thought that was so exciting. We found out
later on that it was called Wonder Bread.
[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: Candy that you could chew all day? Right?
>> Susan Warsinger: Yeah. We found out kids had candy you
could chew all day. What do you think it was? Chewing gum.
Yes.
[Laughter]
Then also there was a sailor sitting next to my brother, who
offered my brother a drink. Here you are, these little kids, | wasn't
quite sure whether my brother should drink this drink. It was
brown, it had bubbles in it. The sailor said, "Oh, it's OK. It's OK."
My brother drank it. He liked it a lot. The sailor said, "It is
Coca-Cola."
[Laughter]
So it was a wonderful experience.
Anyway, his rash subsided, and we came onshore and my
father was there waiting for us.

beginning? Oh, yeah, he got together with some farmer who had
chickens, and he bought eggs from the farmer, and he brought
them home, he had this little machine. You put the egg in the
machine and there's a light. You call it candling. You looked to
make sure there are no bloodstains in there. Then he put them
into separate containers, then he sold it.

Washington. We went straight to Washington.

Well, | checked it all out, and on my mother's side they all
went to concentration camps and they died in Riga. My father's
family, they were Polish, then you could probably learn that if you
go to another exhibit, what they did to the Polish Jews. There was
father Dubois who went around to all of these little villages to find
out what happened to the Jews, because there was no record of
them. He found out from the people that were living in the town
that when the Nazis came into their little town, they made all of the
people go into the woods, dig graves, and then they shot them.

great-grandchildren, my brothers and their families, my friends
and the visitors here in the audience to rejoice in the fact that we

in making sure that no dictatorship would ever usurp our liberties.

What do we have to do? We need to remember the
atrocities that happened to families during the Holocaust and pass
this information on to our progeny. But besides remembering, we
have to take action to confront hate. Just as our museum strives
to motivate citizens and leaders to overcome indifference and
work to protect free societies and prevent future genocides, we as
individuals have to do the same. We have to take care of each
other, and what we do matters.

Now, why do | work in this museum, people ask me. How

part of our history so that they will apply it to themselves and
become better police officers, future leaders, and informed
citizens.

Hopefully, it will teach them that they should never just be
onlookers when they see injustice occurring in their lives.

When you visit the permanent exhibit, you will understand
that my part of the story takes place on the fourth floor. Be sure to
look at the exhibit that is near the beginning, on the fourth floor,
that discusses the boycotting of stores. Also take a look at the
propaganda section. The young students are reading a book
called "The Poison Mushroom." This is where little kids are
learning that a Jew is a poison mushroom.

Look for the Jewish responses. Look for the avian
conference and especially the part about the Night of Broken
Glass.

Also, look at the voyage of the St. Louis. This ship looks
just like the Serpa Pinto that | was on. And please also visit our
