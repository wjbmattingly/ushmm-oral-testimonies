day. We wanted my mom not to worry, so we thought we will run ahead of the — all

the — those sleds. So we ran, ran, ran, until we couldn’t see them. Then we got cold,

and we waited, you know for them to come. And next morning, I woke up, I

couldn’t stand up on my feet, my legs swell all the way here, like big, you know. So

my mom had to carry me, and she, you know, she shouldn’t heavy — lift me at all.

And so she begged that lady that was driving, if she could — one more person could

get the ride. So she — something she gave her that finally she agreed. So I was

sitting and my sister was walking behind. And in the snow, to walk, that’s not

picnic.
