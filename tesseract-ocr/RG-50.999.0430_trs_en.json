My name is Bill Benson. | am host of the museum's public program First Person.\nThank you for joining us today. We are in our 14th year of First Person. Our First Person\ntoday is Mr. Gerald Liebenau, whom we shall meet shortly.\nThis 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the\ngenerosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again\nsponsoring First Person.\nFirst Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of\nthe Holocaust who share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the\nHolocaust. Each First Person guest serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program\nwill continue through mid-August. The Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides\ninformation about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\nGerald, or Gerry, Liebenau, will share with us his First Person\naccount of his experience during the Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we\nhave time towards the end of our program, there will be an opportunity for you to ask Gerry a\nfew questions.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades.\nWhat you are about to hear is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a\nbrief slide presentation to help with his introduction.\nWe begin with this photo, this portrait, of Gerald Liebenau at age. Gerry was born to a Jewish family in Berlin, Germany in 1925.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nGerry's father was a window decorator for a major large\ndepartment store. In this photo, we see Gerry and his parents on the beach in Estonia in29.\nGerry was the eldest of two children. Here we see Gerry, his\nmother, and his younger sister Irene in this photo taken in 1937 or 1938.\nIn 1938, five years after the Nazis came to power, Gerry and his\nfamily moved to London, England, where they waited for visas to the United States. In\nFebruary 1939 they emigrated to the U.S. Here is Gerry's original U.S. Immigration\nIdentification Card.\nIn 1944, after graduating from high school, Gerry joined the U.S.\nArmy. We close with this photograph of Gerry returning to the U.S. from his post in Austria in46.\nAfter the war, Gerry attended Yale University before beginning\nhis career with the federal government, most of which was spent with the CIA. | am very sorry\nto say that Gerry lost his wife Vivian two months ago. Vivian was his childhood sweetheart.\nThey were married 64 years. They had four children, one son and three daughters. Their son\nJonathan teaches at the London School of Economics. Daughter Betsi is a school readiness\ncoordinator for Fairfax County, Virginia, Arlene is with the folk life division of the Smithsonian\nInstitution, and Janet is a primary school teacher who earned her master's degree in education\nseveral years ago. Their four grandchildren are ages 15 to 30. The oldest grandson just got\nmarried two weeks ago.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ;\nAnd daughters Betsi and Arlene are both here with us today. A\nlittle wave, Arlene? There we go. Thank you.\nGerry has been associated with this museum since before it\nopened 20 years ago, and volunteered for many years with the Museum's visitor services. He\nalso did translation work for the Museum, including documents for the Varian Frye Exhibit,\nwhich memorialized Frye's clandestine efforts that rescued some 2,000 persons from\nNazi-controlled Vichy, France, including intellectuals and artists such as Marc Chagall and\nHeinrich Mann. In addition to his work translating for the Museum, Gerry spent 10 years\ntranslating works of the renowned Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler that had not been\npreviously translated. Gerry and Vivian loved to sail and did so for many years. After they\nsold their boat several years ago, they continued their love of sailing as one of their children\nhas a boat.\nWith that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First\nPerson, Mr. Gerald Liebenau.\n[Applause]\n>> Bill Benson: Gerry, thank you so much for joining us, for your willingness to be our First\nPerson today. You have so much to share with us in a short hour, so we'll just jump in right\naway, if you don't mind.\nGerry, you were born in 1925, before Hitler and the Nazis\u2019 rise to\npower. Before we get into the beginning of your odyssey leaving Germany, tell us about those\nearly years, the years before -- when you were a youngster, before the Nazis came to power,\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nabout your family and your community.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: | grew up in sort of a middle class, maybe lower middle class\nneighborhood. The only thing it had that was really worthwhile living there was a beautiful\npark. Eventually | would go back to that.\nMy father changed his job. Just came out of the Army. He was\na soldier for four years for the German Army. He received the highest awards for his work. He\nhappened to be a heavy machine gunner. And when | went into the Army, | also became a\nheavy machine gunner. | don't Know how that ever fits together, but there must be some gene\nsomewhere.\n| grew up as a child, and | had a very early and happy early\nchildhood. | went to public school. My teacher was a very nice guy. | remember him to this\nday. Even know his name. The name of one of our football coaches some years ago.\nHowever that came together.\n| enjoyed my schooling. | was not a top student. My father\nreminded me of that when | would show my report cards, which | kept. There was interesting\nlittle information | have there, testament, of wnat happened to me over the years.\nIn 1936, the Nuremburg Laws kicked in, something Hitler\ndefined to separate the German people from everybody else. His idea was that Germans have\na pure blood, unlike any other people. He persuaded a number of people of doing that, that\nthis was ok. And since Jewish blood was not the same as German blood, it was impossible for\nJews to have any -- impossible for Jews to have any contact with Germans. He managed to\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nmake people believe this. | am sure most of the people didn't believe him. They sort of went\naround with it because it was just too dangerous to have your own ideas.\nThis idea, in 1930 -- and then these Nuremberg Laws, which\nwere designed mostly to eliminate everyone else who's not German, they dictated what your\nlife is going to be like. And among those things were that a Jewish child could no longer go to\npublic school.\nThen in 1936, | had to go to a Jewish school. And you can\nimagine all of a sudden, all of these kids coming to the same school. There were few, not\nmany, because not many people went to Jewish schools. All of a sudden they were flooded\nwith people who they never expected to get. It was not a comfortable time.\nIn addition to that, life became a little bit more tense. | Know that\nbecause | looked back on my report cards, and | got worse and worse marks. The only way\nthat can be explained is that the tension that | had at home kind of seeped into me, and | was\nalso affected by it.\n>> Bill Benson: If you don't mind, let me take you back a little bit and ask you a couple of other\nquestions, before we get to that point. Tell us a little bit about your mother.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: My mother was -- you want to hear the whole story? My mother was\nborn -\n>> Bill Benson: | do, actually.\n[Laughter]\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Her parents -- they had money. They had\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\na beautiful home. In addition to the house, they lived in the city. We used to go and visit there\nbecause they had beautiful beaches. It was my first exposure to really nice beach weather. |\nbecame affected by that for the rest of my life.\nMy mother began to study piano. Eventually she studied in St.\nPetersburg, which was sort of the cultural center of Russia. When the revolution started, her\nmother told her to come home.\nMy father, who was in the German Army, was stationed as an\noccupation soldier. He went to services at the synagogue. At the end of services a man said,\nwould you like to come to my home for supper? Which apparently was done in those days.\nMy father did, and saw that beautiful girl there who he fell in love with and eventually they were\nmarried. She at one point decided that St. Petersburg was not good enough. She wanted to\ngo to Berlin because that's where my father was. So they got together in Berlin. They were\nmarried in 1922. They lived a very nice life together. They had a very nice life.\nMy mother was also, because of her musical ear, a genius at\nlanguages. My father, who tried to learn English, never really could learn English. My mother,\non the other hand, picked it up as if it were part of her nature.\nTo go back to where | was before, tension grew in my family.\nAnd there are two ways | could tell this. One was the fact that my father trying English, which\nwas a hopeless task. You could not tune in to any station that was not a German station. He\nhad to listen to a London station because it was the only way he could hear any English, but\nthat didn't help him either.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nlt was a tense situation. | knew something was happening in my\nfamily. My mother became more agitated. We had one other outlet which was quite important\nto my family. My father was a sportsman. He was an athlete. He rowed. He was a member\nof a Jewish rowing club. There were several of those in Berlin. The club had a large -- most\nimportant, it was located right on the river, the river that goes through Berlin. Learned to swim\nthere and swam there for many years until | learned how.\nIt so happens, this was long before they started cleaning rivers\nand doing something about the environment. Right across from where we were swimming was\na chemical company. | have no doubt that they dumped the chemicals into the same river in\nwhich | was swimming. And if | lived a long life, and am fairly healthy, | imagine | was\nimmunized for all of these diseases that people go to the doctor for to be immunized.\n| noticed that the adults in that club started talking about how to\nget out of Germany. This was the subject taking on increasing importance in the Jewish\ncommunity.\nYou might wonder why is it that the Jewish community didn't\ncatch on earlier? After all, Hitler came into power in 1933. He let everybody know what his\nidea was. He wrote a book, \"My Struggle,\" in which he told everybody, we're going to get rid of\nthe Jews, get rid of the Pols, all of these, he told people. But nobody believed him. The\nJewish community in Berlin felt very safe. They felt safe because they lived there for so long.\nThe first Jew to come to Berlin was in 1712 or something like that, on the records, walked into\nBerlin. They've always been there. They've always been part of the community, part of\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nsociety. They were part of the government. They had senior government officials who were\nJewish. They couldn't believe that somebody would actually do something with all of these\nclever people and all of this knit community that Germany was that they would listen to a guy\nlike Adolph Hitler. And yet, they did.\nAdolph Hitler had one secret. He had probably the best\npropaganda machine anybody ever had invented. Many others came after along with him.\nSoviets did some similar things. But the Germans were unique in making it a science. What\nthey had to say about Jews, their blood, their physical stature. Upstairs, the top floor where\nyou begin your tour, you'll see doctors measuring kids' heads because they could tell a Jew\nfrom the size of his head and how the bones were structured. That's how much they\npenetrated the science and the culture of the German people.\n>> Bill Benson: Gerry, you mentioned that there were Jews in the government. You\nwitnessed an incident at the justice. Will you tell us about that?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Yes. Thank you. The park that was across the street from my building -\n| lived in an apartment block. The entire block was practically one building, one right next to\nthe other, four stories high or five, and we had an apartment way at the top. My playing\nground was the park. That's where | went. | didn't have to go far, across the street into the\npark. We played the games German kids played, Cowboys and Indians. That's all the\nGerman kids wanted to play. To this day, you have Cowboy and Indian clubs in Berlin that\npeople actually dress in exactly the same kind of clothing that they wore when there was real\nCowboys and Indians in the wild west. It's an enormous industry, this cowboy business.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection P\nOne day we were playing. All of a sudden there was a lot of\npeople gathered in front of a courthouse, a huge courthouse, at the end of the park. All of\nthese people were coming together, which not usually happened. As kids, we wanted to see\nwhat was going on. We went over there and saw after a while that the whole place was lined\nby storm troopers. Storm troopers were the active guys who were actually charged with\nmaking sure everybody stays in line.\nThe doors open. A whole lot of men in dark suits and briefcases\nin their hands walked out of the building. | went by these Nazi storm troopers. Then | knew\nsomething was up. Because it turned out they were all Jews. And it was the beginning of the\nsegregation of the Jews of almost everything that was going on in Germany. It was part of the\nNuremberg Laws. German Jews, Jewish children could no longer play with non-Jewish\nchildren. Jewish doctors lost their license to practice. German doctors were not allowed to\ntreat Jews. It was one of those things that covered everything, including eventually that Jews\nno longer could use the public transportation system.\nThere was other increasing pressure on the Jewish community.\nSo this talk that | saw in the club my father took us to almost every weekend in the summer\nwas beginning to make sense to me. As a young boy of 12 years, | knew more or less what\nwas going on.\nThe business about leaving Germany was almost impossible. It\ncould have been done earlier in the Nazi period before they got themselves organized. But by\nthe time people began to feel what was going on in their lives, they were no longer able to get\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nout.\nTo come to the United States, for example, you had to have\nsomebody in the United States vouch in a little document known as an affidavit that you would\nnot only become a charge of the U.S. government, that you never will be needing help from the\nU.S. government. And for somebody to do that with two kids, a husband, wife, that's quite a\nbig job to take on.\n| was lucky. My mother, who was a typical German housewife,\nonly job was to play the piano -- and she practiced all day long, | think. She supervised the\nmaids, the cooks. She made sure everything was going fine when my father was out.\nHe, by the way, by this time became a textile merchant, a new\njob he learned because he couldn't believe that anybody could work as a window decorator in\nthe hot summer or the cold winter. It was not a job for an old man.\nSO my -\n>> Bill Benson: This is when your mother, | think, began to think about relatives in the United\nStates.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Yes. Thank you. Sometimes it slides off.\n[Laughter]\n>> Gerald Liebenau: My mother, she had no real responsibilities, but all of a sudden she\nbegan to realize that she had an uncle, her father's brother, who was somewhere in the United\nStates. She had no idea where he was or what his name was. Because his name didn't sit\nwell, so he must have changed his name. She wrote a letter to her father with whom she was\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 5\nin contact and said, By the way, what is your brother's name and where does he live? And as\nluck would have it, he knew who it was. The guy was now named Morris Miller, and he was\nliving in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he had a business. As luck would have it, he also had\na son who just graduated from law school.\nSo the affidavit was something that he could do. My mother\nwrote a very appealing letter. She could do that. She could make tears come out of your\neyes. She told him \u201cPlease save us,\u201d because there was no other way we could ever leave\nGermany without their help.\nSure enough, he did send an affidavit. And my mother, who\nwas always sort of a leader when it came to talking with people, took it to the U.S. Embassy.\nThe attach\u00e9 who was in charge looked at the affidavit and said: That's not good enough. Why\nisn't it good enough? Well, he has his business. Can't make that much money in that\nbusiness. The business was secondhand clothing store on Lackawanna Avenue. That was\nabout as low as you could get. Not much money was being made there. But, obviously, he\nhad enough money to send his boy to law school. But that was not satisfying the council.\nAt that time the U.S. government, the U.S. State Department,\nwas not favorably in view of the Jews. They didn't like to see Jews come into the United\nStates. And there was a lot of pressure on these people who were issuing the exit permits,\nactually the visas, for people to come to the States, to give the Jewish people as hard a time\nas they could.\nBy this time you're talking 1938. We're getting close to the end\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nof any departure from Germany.\n>> Bill Benson: Gerry, | think you told me at the rowing club when they would start -- the\nconversation turned to migration, because the U.S. was so difficult to get to, that they were\ntalking about destinations like Argentina, China, places like that.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: There were very few countries that actually had an open emigration\npolicy. China was one of the few countries that did. And, yes, there was a Jewish community\nin Shanghai, of which there was an exhibit in this building, how they maintained their identity\nand eventually many of the Chinese came to the United States. Many of the Jews who live in\nChina, survived in China, came to the United States.\n>> Bill Benson: Fortunately, because your mother had the relative, you were able to get that\naffidavit. But as you were saying, it wasn't good enough.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: My father, who still has this idea that the Nazis were looking only for\nmen, he couldn't conceive of the idea that women and children would also be included in this\nbeginning of taking -- [Inaudible].\nIn this textile business, he had customers in England. The\nmanufacturing of certain cottons were done in England. He had high-quality material. And |\nguess because Germany needed foreign currency, they were able to take a business trip,\nwhich was limited in time, several months. Allowed to go to England and purchase these\ntextiles so that money would start flowing into Germany, which you would have to give up in\nGermany for marks. My father had no intention of getting back to Germany, Knowing full well\nhe no longer had a chance to survive in Berlin.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection |\nThat left my mother and her two children to take care of\neverything that had to be done, to leave a home and move somewhere else. Except she\ncouldn't go anywhere else, except she also had this idea if she could persuade somebody in\nthe American Embassy that all she wanted to do was visit her husband and the children, that\nsomebody might allow.\nLuckily we're talking about human beings, because they're all\ndifferent. Some people meld together. Others will do whatever they can to help other people.\nThis time she saw somebody who actually let her have a visa for us to visit my father. I'm sure\nthey knew -- knew exactly what we were doing. But in this case the man apparently was\nconscious of the plight that my family was in.\nSome time before that, the Nazis came looking for my family.\nAnd this is an interesting story because it tells you a lot about people. The Gestapo people,\ntwo of them who came into the house, the building, first went to the custodian. The custodian\nalways had a little room on the first floor where you come in, checked everybody out when you\nwalked through. They stopped and said where was the family. And she said, without\nhesitation, \"They're not there anymore. They left.\" And since it was four flights up, they\ndecided it's not worth going to. So they didn't. If they had come upstairs, they would have\nfound us. Not my father, but my mother, sister, and me. So it was interesting, Germans\nhousing people. There were several of them, probably many of them who would have done\ndifferently from what the Nazis asked them to do. But they had no choice either.\nSo this woman rescued my family.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\n>> Bill Benson: Before you get to London, you described to me what you called a magical\nmoment, when a truck pulled up in front of your house.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Another example of what Germans do, decent people do. My father had\na sense to pay a transportation company to move our furniture from Berlin to Scranton,\nPennsylvania. He paid for it. Got a receipt. And totally unexpected, one day a huge moving\ntruck with these massive containers, used to ship things in, pulled up at my apartment building\nand started taking our furniture out to be shipped to Scranton, Pennsylvania, which tells you,\nagain, that's not what the Nazis wanted you to do. They wanted to take that stuff and take it\nsomewhere else and sell it to somebody so the Nazis could make more money or whatever\nthey wanted to do. But this worked. He was paid. He had a job to do. He did it.\n>> Bill Benson: And before you went to London to join your father, Kristallnacht occurred. Will\nyou tell us a little about that?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: On November 6, 1938, a Polish -- young Polish man living in Paris who\nhad, obviously, some mental problems became angry because his family, in Germany -- all\nPoland was sent into concentration camp. He shot a German Foreign Service Officer. He was\ncaught. There was a lot of to-do made about it, but the Nazis took that act as a starting point\nfor their own final solution. They began burning down every synagogue they could and every\nsynagogue that was not next to a building close enough to start a fire.\nThe synagogue that | attended, my family attended, it was\ncompleted building in 1930. 1938 it was burned. It started again with a caretaker for the\nbuilding who called up the rabbi and said, Our synagogue is burning. The rabbi, who was\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nwell-known, a very talented and very gifted speaker, rushed to the scene. He sent a letter to\nmy family many years after this telling him this story exactly as I'm telling it to you now. The\nletter is now in this museum. He said, \"| came to a scene, and there were these firemen\nhosing down all the buildings in the neighborhood to be sure that they don't catch fire while the\nNazis kept stoking the fire that made sure the building would burn.\" | saw that building in 1946.\n| went to Berlin. | was stationed in Vienna, and | went to Berlin. | visited the site of the\nsynagogue. Sure enough, it was burned down. Everything that could burn burned in that\nbuilding. It was an immense building. It was larger -- it could accommodate more people than\nthis room has. It was a majestic building. And there it was.\nBut you know what? Every single building in that entire\nneighborhood was bombed to pieces. There must have been a flight going over that street\nand left a stick of bomb on every building. Somehow all these businesses trying to save their\nbuildings didn't quite work.\n>> Bill Benson: On that night of November 9-10, Kristallnacht, Night of the Broken Glass, for\nyou, | think you told me that you were coming home or somewhere and you saw an art store\nthat mattered to you, and that was destroyed, and that's when you realized what was going on.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Yeah. | was not there when the synagogue was on fire. But! went to\nschool that day because nobody knew what was going on anyhow. But suddenly | came to the\ncorner of the building of the street | lived on and a large art supply store had been totally\nsmashed. The windows were broken. All the things that | used to look at, because | really\nliked those things, liked the paper, the pens, all the crayons, all the paraphernalia that goes\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nwith making pictures. And | saw that building totally, the store, destroyed.\n>> Bill Benson: Jewish-owned business.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Jewish-owned business. That was only one of thousands of businesses\nthat were destroyed.\n>> Bill Benson: So soon after that, you started to tell us you then were able to get to England.\nTell us what happened to you, how you got out of Germany and what happened when you\ncrossed the border into the Netherlands.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: When you got to the train station -- we did get on. Our tickets were\ngood. Again, somehow this was my father's business as well to see that we get tickets. My\nmother and my sister and | were already thinking we've made it. We're on the train. The train\nis moving in the right direction. But suddenly at the Dutch border the train stopped. Everyone\nwas told to get out. At that point my mother lost it. She had all the courage and knew exactly\nwhat to do at all times, really thought this was the end. And she could have thought that way.\nWhy else would they take us all off the train? They put us into a hotel. | never shall forget that\nnight. | had to tell my mother to please calm down, never mind my sister. It was a moment |\nhad to grow up all of a sudden.\nThe next day, without any explanation, we were told to get back\non the train and continued into Holland. We came to England. My father had a small\napartment, a very small apartment. Apparently it wasn't big enough to accommodate all four of\nus, so | was selected to be handed over to another family, a very Orthodoxed Jewish family,\nand | was not an Orthodox Jew, but | knew enough to say I'll make a go. They were wonderful\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nContact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection ig\npeople. They took me in. They treated me like their son. And above all, they said, you know\nwhat, you have to become bar mitzvahed because you're turning 13 years old. At that point,\nevery Jewish boy has to be bar mitzvahed or he doesn't become an adult or something like\nthat. Sure enough, as it turns out, if | had wanted to come -- they said they don't know how to\ndo that in the United States. You can't trust it.\n[Laughter]\n>> Gerald Liebenau: If they had only known how much they saved my life. | didn't have to\nlearn whole portions of the Bible. | didn't have to have a big party. My parents must have\nbeen glad. But they were very, very decent people. | guess this is an aside. The Jewish\ncommunity in Berlin was very self-contained. They thought they were the best.\nLet me tell you about the Jewish community. Sometime in 1931,\nthe Jewish community felt something had to be done to let the Nazis know that the Jews in\nGermany were an important part of the society, that they had money, they were well-educated,\nthey had big names. After all, Einstein was in Berlin. You really shouldn't throw all of these\npeople. They're too good. They're too important.\nSo this book here -- this is like a telephone book -- has the name\nof every Jewish household, and it gives the address. | don't think it gives the telephone\nnumber. Their address. They gave this book out to let people know not only how many\npeople were in Germany -- remember, it's difficult to come by. But by 1938, they said there\nmay have been 160,000 Jews in Berlin.\n>> Bill Benson: All listed there.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection g\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Hmm\u2019?\n>> Bill Benson: All listed there.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: This was given out to everybody who had access to it. | am sure this\nmust have helped the Gestapo greatly to find all the Jews. It was like a guidebook of how to\nfind Jews in Berlin. Little did they know putting this -- but it shows you they had no fear. They\nwere not concerned about their life. They were sure that their life in Berlin was as safe as\nanywhere in the world.\nLet me put this book up.\n>> Bill Benson: Gerry, you were in England. And then eventually, of course, you would make\nit to the United States. How were they able to make that happen?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: This is kind of a murky chapter in my history. My parents now actually\nhad two affidavits. The second affidavit was from a friend of Morris Miller, my uncle. And this\nwas by a Jewish fellow who was not related to us, who owned movie theaters. Movie theaters,\nyou could get 20 people in. They were all over town. All you saw was cowboy movies. |\nguess this affidavit also was written by my cousin, the lawyer. And when my mother took that\nto Berlin, he also said, \u201cThis is not good enough because he's not a blood relative.\u201d So twice\nhe turned them down.\nWhen they got to England, they now had two affidavits. They\nwent to the U.S. Embassy. My mother did this again. | tell you, without my mother, | don't\nthink we would be alive today.

This guy said,\n\u201cSure, fine.\u201d And we got our visas, and soon we were on our way to the States.\nWe were traveling on a ship, a four-stacker, looks exactly like\nthe Titanic. Nothing happened. We had to be in the lowest class, third class, whatever it was,\nway down in the bottom. But we were treated well, fed well. It was all very nice. And one\nday -- we couldn't go anywhere. It was not like today when you're on a cruise, you go\neverywhere you want to go. There were very restricted places that people from birth there\ncould go to. But you could always go -- back in the boat there was lots of space. People could\nwalk. | used to go there. One day | saw a kid about my age, nicely dressed, suit and tie.\nPeople dressed up when they traveled anywhere at that time. There was no sport clothes or\nsneakers.\nSo | went up to him and | said, \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d | had\nlearned by this time a little English because | was going to school in London for a month or\ntwo. So | knew enough to say, \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d This kid says to me, \u201cD.C.\u201d | said,\n\u201cWhat's the name of the town?\u201d \u201cD.C.\u201d | said, \u201cWell, where is it located?\u201d \"D.C.\" By this time |\nsaid this guy has lost it. Guess where | ended up. D.C.\n[Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: One thing I'd like you to share with us before we talk about -- a little bit of time\nwe have left -- about when you got to the United States. Your father had been a very avid\nstamp collector. And those stamps actually became really important to your journey.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Well, it was the first clandestined operation | ever saw. | was nota\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .,\nparticipant in that. My father was a great stamp collector. He knew stamps. He knew what\nkinds were valuable. He had them. He was fairly meticulous in putting these stamps into a\ncollection. His books looked perfect. Every stamp was covered. Every stamp was perfectly\nput in. He hoped he could take this stamp collection and take it with him outside and then sell\nit in the States and maybe have some money. But Germans wouldn't let him -- you couldn't\nkeep anything. So he decided he'd smuggle some of those stamps out. He had a cousin, a\nrelative of some sort, who was a manufacturer of albums. And these albums had thick covers.\nYou could open the back of it and put things in there. He put a good part of his collection into\nthese albums and glued it back together and sent it as a package to a friend of his in Mexico.\nIt worked. When we got back to the States, he got the stamps back. I'm not sure that he sold\nmuch. He kept collecting stamps. And collectors don't sell. They're collectors. They don't\nsell. But | guess it did help in a few instances.\n>> Bill Benson: That was your first clandestined operation.\n[Laughter]\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: So you arrived in the United States. One of the things | wanted you to tell us\nabout, you're now in the United States and they put you in the second grade.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: In those days they had no use of English for foreign speakers, this sort of\nthing. They put me in the second grade. | was 13 years old. | was yay tall. | swear to this day\nthey put me in the second because the first grade didn't have a chair big enough for me. So |\nstarted second grade. | must have done well. | moved up. And by the time | got into eighth\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\ngrade, | was with my cohorts. All about the same age. | got to the high school. And all of a\nsudden my grades became great. | was at the top of the class. | must have had a real\npsychological sort of infusion when | was in Germany. | just had to get out of there. | did fine.\n>> Bill Benson: You ended up being class valedictorian, didn't you?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: | was one of the class speakers. My accent was horrible. But | did talk\nabout patriotism and fighting. Because as soon as | got out of high school, | was in the Army.\n>> Bill Benson: You had met Vivian by this time, in high school. You were supposed to go to\nyour high school prom, right?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: This is a terrible story.\n[Laughter]\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Yes. | did meet my wife, my future wife. By this time we moved to New\nLondon, Connecticut. New London, Connecticut, is a wonderful city. They have beaches.\nThey have all the summer entertainment you would ever want. We were very happy in\nAmerica. And that's where | met my girlfriend. It was on the beach. | went to the beach.\nThere was this gaggle of girls. | believed they must have pulled straws as to who's going to\nget this guy coming down. And my wife won. That was in the Army.\n>> Bill Benson: You can talk some more. I'll let you Know when you can't.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: People who want jobs, listen to this. When | was in the Army, | was a\nheavy machine gunner. They sent me to Italy, a little bit north of Naples. It was a terrible time.\nThey gave us uniforms and clothing for hot Italian weather. It was cold. It was the middle of\nwinter. I've never been so cold in my life. And all we did was take our heavy machine guns\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 3\nand walk up and down into little villages. | was getting very tired of that. And one day\nsomebody told me, \u201cYou're going to have to report to somebody in Naples.\u201d So | said, \u201cSure.\u201d\n| put on a uniform. In those days every soldier had a uniform. Not just for keeps. | report to\nthis guy. He said to me, \u201cWould you like to jump out of airplanes and kill Germans behind the\nlines?\u201d | thought for a minute. | was told that the machine gunner could live about 10 seconds\nbefore everybody kills him. | said, \u201cIt must take longer than 10 seconds to jump out of an\nairplane.\" | never had even been in an airplane. The idea of jumping out of it was totally\nabsurd. But what should | do? | said yes.\nThe next thing | Knew, | was -- | lived in a tent. The tent had\ncots. It was cold, drafty, and awfully uncomfortable. So when | got to this new outfit which |\njust joined, | was taken to a villa. | was on the seashore. Had its own beach, had maids and\ncooks. | said, I'm dead and I'm in paradise. That's how we got into the OSS. Didn't tell me\nwhat it was until | had enough clearances to be told where | was. And | was actually going to\nbe sent with a team to Austria.\nThose of you who saw \"The Glorious Bastards,\" that film depicts\nthe team that came out of my unit. We had the same commanding officer. | was going to do\nexactly the same mission. But! since learned these missions are rarely successful, and the\nhead of that team was very successful. He was an outstanding soldier, a wonderful operator.\nHe did save the city. He simply talked the mayor into letting the city go as an open city. By\nthis time, Patton was very close to Austria, and that helped. It was an amazing stunt. So! was\nready to fight. It was one of those things where the operation succeeded beyond belief.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection va\n>> Bill Benson: Do remember what it was like for you to know that just a few years earlier you\nwere a Jewish family having to flee Germany because of the Nazis and now you are a U.S.\nsoldier there and the war is going on? What was that like?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: | was too busy being a soldier. | had really no vision of my past. |\nbecame an American in a minute, a second, whatever it took.\nThe whole idea of why we're here today, that there was a\nhorrible thing going on in Germany, that millions of Jews were being killed in camps, that was\nnot normal. In fact, most people never even talked about it. | had some inkling of that when |\nwas Stationed in Vienna with the OSS. The war was over. | couldn't go on my mission. So\nthey took me to Austria in a jeep. It was very nice. The Austrians were just as happy to see us\nas they were when Hitler came into Austria. They couldn't be nicer. And | really had too much\nto do. | was very busy. Out of our mission was called Paper Clip, which was an Army-wide\neffort to collect scientists. And that's what we got. It was a very exciting time, to find people\nwho could help the U.S. government become a new family of weapons.\nThe Germans -- still talk?\n>> Bill Benson: You're still talking.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: You have no time for questions.\n>> Bill Benson: We'll get a couple in. | want you to finish up.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: The Germans, by this time, had developed a plane that could fly without\npropellers. A jet plane. | actually talked to a scientist, a woman who was about this tall, and\nshe was a major test pilot for the German Air Force. She flew these planes about which we\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nknew very little. So you can imagine she became a very important person for the Air Force.\nShe was sent to the States. She became a citizen. And did some very good work.\nlt was one of those things you had done something good and it was worth something.\n>> Bill Benson: Before we turn to our audience for a couple of questions, at what point do you\nthink you and your parents, sister, family, realized the enormity of the Holocaust and what it\nmeant for other members?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: | have to tell you -- when did people realize? The world became aware\nof it when the movies came out.\n>> Bill Benson: \"Schindler's List?\"\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Yeah. Probably the start of this. You began to see all of a sudden\nsomething happened about which they knew nothing. | was aware of it because in Vienna\nthere were Jews who had been rescued by various forces, U.S. forces, who came back to\nVienna. There was a service at Passover. | went there -- well, we had lots of food in our place\nand a lot of liquor. So | took some with me, took it to them. That was the first time | met\npeople who actually had gone through this. And they were still looking like they had never\ncome out. They were haggard, old, sick. It was a real revelation that this was the leftover of\nthe Jewish community of Germany. Austria.\n>> Bill Benson: Let's turn to our audience for a couple of questions. We have a microphone.\nPlease make your questions as brief as you can. If | think that not everybody heard it, | will\nrepeat it, but otherwise Gerry will immediately answer.\nA couple of quick volunteers. Yes, sir?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\n>> What was the population of Berlin, total, if the Jews were 160,000?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: The entire population of Berlin? | think it was around 4 million. Some\nfigure.\n>> Bill Benson: A question right here.\n>> | was just curious. As a child growing up, did you notice after like the Nuremberg Laws\nwere enacted -- did you notice a change in the way that your classmates treated you? Was\nthere a difference?\n>> Bill Benson: Did you notice -- after the Nuremberg Laws came into effect, did you notice\ndifferent treatment by your classmates toward you at school?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: That came with it. That's a good question. As a kid, 8, 9, 10 years old, |\nsaw these German kids in uniform, black pants, brown shirts, leather belts, marching down the\nstreet. | was jealous. | felt that they had something | never could get. But | was also aware of\nthe fact that these were pretty rough kids. Fighting started between -- you see, one of the\nthings that Hitler was able to do was to make the Communist regime the alternative to history.\nHe said to the German people, You're going to take me, you're going to get [Inaudible]. While\nthey knew nothing about Nazis, they sure knew about socialism and Communism. And that\nwas a fear most Germans had. One of the things, tactics, he used to put himself into an\nimportant position of being able to help.\n>> Bill Benson: | think you told me that as a kid, you saw street fights.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: There were fights between communists and Nazis. And they were quite\nrough. The Nazis were not a gentle -- they must have found these guys in beer holes, in\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nplaces where workers would go who had no background in politics, were easily led to believe\nthat their life was now going to become better because Hitler had some ideas.\n>> Bill Benson: One more. Back here.\n>> |'m just curious about -- | know your immediate family was able to get saved. But what\nabout extended family? Did they get saved as well?\n>> Bill Benson: The question was, what about others in your extended family? Your family,\nimmediate family, made it. But what about others?\n>> Gerald Liebenau: Well, if you look in this book -- | was able to find my family -- my father's\nfamily, he lost his brother, his sister-in-law. My mother's family actually was -- she lost a sister.\nHer sister was living in Berlin. She was on her way to her father in Estonia. And she was\ntaken off the train with her child. And best as we can know now, they were shot in the woods\nof either Lithuania or Latvia.\n>> Bill Benson: We're -- one more question right here in the front. Then we'll wrap up.\n>> Please forgive me if this is too personal.\n[Question Inaudible]\n>> Gerald Liebenau: No. | think they became increasingly aware of their losses. No question.\nThere was no more contact with my mother's sister. My father's brother and wife had a child\nwho was on a transport. The children were taken to England, by English. There were many of\nthose saved. They were simply put by their parents on a train. | think every one of them must\nhave suffered from that for the rest of their lives. They were taken away from their parents.\nThe communication between parents and children, we do have letters of that. They suffered. |\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nthink it affected their whole life.\n>> Bill Benson: I'm going to turn back to Gerry in a moment to close our program. | want to\nthank all of you for being with us today. | remind you that we'll have First Person programs\nevery Wednesday and Thursday through the middle of August. So | invite you return either\nsometime this year or on a future visit to Washington, D.C. If you live locally, come back\nwhenever you can.\nIt's our tradition at First Person that our First Person has the last\nword. I'll turn back to Gerry. When he's done, he'll step off the stage. If you want to come and\nask more questions or just say hi, absolutely feel free to do that.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: All the time.\n>> Bill Benson: Ok.\n>> Gerald Liebenau: What is it | can learn from this? My only thought is that we do have the\nbest system in the world. We have a constitution that protects us. It's up to us now to make\nsure that we are aware of the freedoms and those which might impede us. The Germans were\nnot. They saw their rights being taken away. They didn't have the gumption to stand up. They\nwere misled terribly. We have to take a lesson from that. It happened in Germany. It was the\nmost educated, most advanced nation, among the most advanced nations in the world. If it\ncan happen there, could it happen here? Hopefully not.\nThank you.\n[Applause]\n[The presentation ended at 2:01 p.m.]\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n",
