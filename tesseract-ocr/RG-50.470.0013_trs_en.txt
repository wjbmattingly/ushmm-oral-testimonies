I saw many blocks decorated. It took probably a minute, you
know, all the decoration must must have been waiting in
storage somewhere...inhale...eh in secret. It was
drizzling, rain drizzling when during that eh eh hour of
liberation, but half the time went by and it cleared-up.
And eh sun began to set down and there was a glorious eh eh
sun-setting but there there were also a very dark clouds on
the East. Usual eh eh East that's Communism, that's where I

that this freedom is not complete. You know. This is-~ only
personal freedom and not the eh eh freedom of my country.

were hundreds of fire fires eh light up and all those who

in that time when they were ey brought from the countries
like Poland, like Russia, like eh eh eh

this camp was primarily Polish you

were born on German soil during that war times, you know,
just the same way there were a lot of children who were who
were born in concentration camps, in women camps. You know
women always have a represent a special problem, problem
that I I don't know much about it. But when I read _ the

contacted by the government in exile, the guy in London, and
they eh agents who use to come and talk to us. They were
talking about the war, everybody in this times expect was
expect that there would be war with the RuSSians. Because
no body in their right mind eh after the liberation thought
that that the Rus that this is the end of the war. You know
half we expected war with the Communism. you know. And _ eh
Since this didn't account we started for eh eh places to go
