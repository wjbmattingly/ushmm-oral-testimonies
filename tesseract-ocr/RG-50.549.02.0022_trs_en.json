He was Orthodox and there was an -- a t-tone of Orthodoxy all throughout the city.

So he commissioned his secretary to start a school for -- for them and out of this grew a school that was called Filantropine, which was -- because of it\u2019s beginning was -- had the -- had a philanthropic connotation, but by the time when my brother and I went, my father was joking that it cost him as much for our education as a -- what a German workman would earn per month. Well, not quite, but, you know, something like that. So this school really- also [indecipherable] Samson Raffelhirsch school, they were always Orthodox and there was no question about it. This school, when -- when -- it had started experimenting with Sunday schooling and with Saturday schooling. They didn\u2019t write on Shabbat, but they ha -- they had school on Shabbat. And then they gave that up again. By the time we went -- this went on through the century. By the time we went to school, it was fairly - well, the people who went were -- who went there were -- not the very Orthodox. So my parents kept kosher and we kept Shabbat, we kept Eviomtop, but we didn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t as the other school. Now, but I remember we were 43 children in the beginning and I -- I don\u2019t know -- I think one confessed that she didn\u2019t -- that that family didn\u2019t keep kosher, and everybody else did. So, if -- if that answers your question -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s enough. I mean we -- my parents belonged to a synagogue that was burned down in 1938 in the Kristallnacht, that would be considered, probably Conservative by today\u2019s standards, even though it was different.

            "answer": "Well, you know, first of all, everybody wanted to go to the United States. People were talking about not going -- not wanting to -- well, of course, many people went for Eur - to European countries -- other European countries and of course, they were invaded there. I mean, Holland and Belgium and France and of course, the people who were sent to Poland in 1938, that the -- this expulsion of the Polish Jews, that brought on Kristallnacht, ostensibly, becau -- that\u2019s what the Nazis said. But they -- they were all destroyed, so there was really no -- no real point to -- of course we didn\u2019t know this at the time. Everyone always said, \u201cOh, look at this crazy man. Look at him in the -- 1n the newsreels, pounding the table and screaming away at --\u201d I mean, this has to end -- this can\u2019t keep going. Of course, it ended, but 12 years too late. So one of the things I f -- my father -- I felt my -- with my father, was j -- he -- my famil -- my father\u2019s family originated in the medieval Frankfort ghetto. And then, when all these things with the Reform and the Orthodox happened, the fa -- this branch of the family got tired of it and they moved to Bratislava and they became well known rabbis, the Sofa family. As a matter of fact, we had a megillah that was given -- made by the Sofas to -- for my grandfather\u2019s wedding. And it was given to him as a gift, my grandfather had it with him, my father had it. When my uncle went to Israel, my Uncle Abba, in 1936, he wanted to take it with him and my father said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s got to stay with the oldest brother.\u201d And of course it was destroyed. Otherwise that beautiful thing would have been now in Israel or perhaps with me or in a museum or somewhere. So, my parent -- my father reali -- my father kept his Czechoslovak passport, because for business, when he traveled, the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Czechoslovakia was at the time the only republic in Europe. They were highly respected and their passport was accepted everywhere and he relied on that to be able to get us out of Germany, which ultimately didn\u2019t work. But -- so he, in traveling, h-he was comfortable thinking that, well, he hears from everybody that the Nazis would stop -- of course later on the -- this -- he couldn\u2019t go any more. This was just in the very beginning. But he heard that well, the Nazis, I mean, who\u2019d look at this nonsense, this is going to stop soon. And I think that\u2019s why they sat. And people started going to S-South America and they wrote back such terrible reports. They couldn\u2019t wait to get back again and things like that, so I guess they didn\u2019t want to subject us to this."

My father relied on his passport and we made our way to the French border. The borders were closed, they wouldn\u2019t let us in. We had to sleep in a farmhouse overnight and then the next day we went back to Frankfort. I\u2019ve heard of people who followed that same route, but they were adults and they swam across the river -- a river -- illegally and made their way into France.

I think 1t was because it - it took on the color because the barrels that they carried it in were rusty. So, that\u2019s what - why it was tea. They gave us something that was like an inch of bread and like a slice This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Then they gave us a slice -- oh, probably also about an inch and a half of either liverwurst or salami. And towards the end of my stay in Auschwitz, one time | -- this was in the sum -- in the summer of 1944, when they were killing -- bringing in Hungarian Jews and they were killing them day and night. And I looked out at the crematorium and I saw the smoke going up and I visualized that my piece of salami was human flesh and I couldn\u2019t eat it any more. I -- I -- whenever there was -- whenever I got the salami -- we didn\u2019t get that every day, we got that like two, three times a week or so. Whenever I got it, I tra -- tried to trade it for a piece of bread, because I just couldn\u2019t eat it. And then -- I don\u2019t know -- I -- if we had three meals or two meals, but usually when we came back from work and -- which was in -- in -- the first work we did was digging in a field and they told us to f -- to dig here with this decrepit shovel that was all bent and you couldn\u2019t get anything. And then wi -- after they filled this in, we -- and it was very, very muddy in Auschwitz, there was a thick clay and mud. It was horrible. So they told us to dig here and then they filled this in. And then when there was a hole that we had dug, we had to fill it in again.

And I\u2019m carrying these potatoes -- I-I\u2019m sorry, the noodles with me. And then, on the way, we ran out of food and there was no one to supply us with anything. Every so often, in a field, we would find little potatoes. We didn\u2019t wash them, ba -- there\u2019s no -- no way of washing, w-we -- there was barely a fire. So we ate them ho -- half raw and full of sand and grit a-and we ate it like that.

So, my grandchildren now tell me, \u201cBut you say you would never eat another potato.

And they thought that their mother had remained in Selonika. As it turned out, later on when I met the cousin, he told me that she was deported a day after the girls. But, of course, the girls couldn\u2019t know that. And Mona had this beautiful, beautiful singing voice and she told me that she wou -- wanted to be an opera singer. One of the things that the Greek girls sang a lot was Ava Maria. As a matter of fact, a few years ago, I was in Israel and -- and Yaffal and I heard Ava Maria played, so I went in to follow the sound. There was a young man from Greece pla -- and he\u2019s a painter. But he was playing -- I don\u2019t know why they happen to love Ava Maria, which is so typically, you know, a Christian and a Catholic -- well, at any rate, while she had her strength, she alwa -- we b-begged her to sing for us and she did. And then Auschwitz, of course took it\u2019s toll, her sister died. And it was like, oh, all the starch was taken out of her. The -- the -- but while she was -- while -- while we -- when we first got there, we only spoke in English. That was the way that we were able to communicate. She spoke English and -- but in -- the Nazis didn\u2019t permit anyone to speak English, because they knew they were bringing in p-people from France and they had to speak French or This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But they didn\u2019t have any prisoners from English speaking places, so, of course it was -- they -- if they had caught us, they would have really beaten us up or who knows what. So we -- being young kids, that\u2019s what we enjoyed doing, while we were still -- still had some strength. So she -- her -- her -- but her sister died and she lost all courage. All -- everything, I mean, was gone from her. And, of course, everybody got weaker at the time, so that had something to do with it. And then this SS man, Talber, heard -- I think I must have talked about this, he heard that she was -- that she had such a wonderful voice and he wanted her to be his housekeeper. Now, the Nazis didn\u2019t encourage sex between the Germans and others. It was -- would dilute the race and it would take it -- whatever. So I don\u2019t know what was on his mind once she would have been in his home. But she refused. And -- remember, you have to realize what a sacrifice she made. I mean, clean sheets, decent food and water and soap. She refused all of this and he made sure that she would not live. So he copied down her number and he made sure that with the next selection, she would go. And she did. And then -- I always thought of her, because she was this wonderful person and we -- she was a fun person while she was still alright. And when I went to -- a few times we had some Christian friends and I went to weddings and I -- they sing Ava Maria at a wedding and I\u2019m sitting there crying and everybod -- they\u2019re saying, \u201cLook at this Jewish woman, crying over Ava Maria.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t because of that, 1t was because I was thinking of my friend, Mona.

And that the people from Greece, ah, couple of Greeks, we didn\u2019t get a - they didn\u2019t get along in Auschwitz when they were there. They were fighting, they were different cultures, different -- they didn\u2019t speak the languages and they didn\u2019t get along too well. So they certainly didn\u2019t get along in -- so then, still not getting along now. And Yad Vashem is not doing very much for them. I think recently they have -- some of their publications have written about the Greek people, but not much. So, there were very few, as I said, people from Greece. And -- but when -- in the last night, when Me-Menachim Begin spoke and we -- at the wall, someone behind me said that he was from Selonika and I turned around -- I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people there, or whatever. I think it must have been thousands. And I turned around and I said I had a good friend from Selonika. And he said, \u201cWell, too bad you don\u2019t know the name.\u201d I said, \u201cBut I do know the name.\u201d I mentioned it to him. And _ he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a large family living -- by that name, living in Selonika.\u201d But he didn\u2019t have any address and he said write to wherever and see if a Jewish community someplace will find it for you. So when I came back, this was first thing on my mind. I called the federation and they were in touch with, you know, ev -- there was so much excitement in the air over that event at the time. They were in touch immediately with the -- a group in Athens. There was no listing for the group in Selonika, but the Athens group finally got me the cousin\u2019s name. And we corresponded. And we met -- when he came, we met about a year or two afterwards. My mother was already very sick and she couldn\u2019t come. She would have This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Now, most of them have left, so they don\u2019t do this any more. And in Israel, five dollars a month doesn\u2019t exactly get you somewhere.

So, when I went up to the table, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should call it Isaac or Ithzak.\u201d And someone in back of me said, \u201cWell then, call him Irving.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, how -- wha -- how does Irving get to my father?\u201d And I don\u2019t even remember what I put down, if it was Isaac or Ithzak.

The only thing was then, someone approached me and I became -- and I went on to became a -- a member of the Board of Overseers for the Rabbinic school for the Jewish Theological Seminary. Took all my energy and money, so I gave up a little bit on Ethiopians.
