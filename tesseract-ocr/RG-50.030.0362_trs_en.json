            "answer": "My parents had a checkered career. They were both immigrants, they arrived from different communities in Lithuania in approximately 1907. My father was married at the time he arrived. And he and my mother met and they fell in love. And eventually they were married. But a lot of sturm und drang! over many years. And so I, I, I was born in22, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger sister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an older half-brother."

            "answer": "Well, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age. His mother died when he was very young. I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called \"A Century of Time.\" And his father remarried a woman who had two small children. My father, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the middle of the night and seeing, some feet away in the kitchen area, by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her children. He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls and bread from his father's bakery in the winter and putting 1t under his coat and running to the edge of town and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese. So it was that kind of poverty. He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that, partly because of the growing spirit of enlightenment, enlightenment that was spreading in the 19th century. And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another town, owning a bakery of his own, hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist movement \u2014 and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905. Anyway, to escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the United States, leaving behind a wife and one or two children. My mother came from another town, which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but ' storm and stress (German); \"life's hard knocks,\" hassles.

It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  2 there was apparently a big fire, which she had no memory of. I picked this up at the Museum of the Diaspora in Israel.:06:10 The population of the town declined by half \u2014 25, 3,000 people. And she was a child of very old parents who had previous marriages. So, at the time she was born, her mother was 50 and her father was 65. And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and her father was 80, and that was a family of butchers. And so, her mother and father decided to turn over their little butcher shop to a, an older sister who was married to a butcher, and in return for room for their stay, being taken care of in their old age. And the son-in-law, husband of sis\u2014 my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the parents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15. So she was sent to America. So, it's a story of great poverty, the background."

My father's older brother lived there with his wife who, it turned out, was a niece of my mother\u2019s, but older than my mother because she had been born to some older half-brother and they had a little baby at the time. And to keep things going they had boarders. So, there was a group of male boarders in one room where my father stayed. And my mother stayed with two or three female boarders in the kitchen on the floor. And that's how they met and shacked up."

We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through Workman's Circle schools. And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't read the English version of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward? and reads that.

And so, in, particularly at the high school level, when I was going, I was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars. It was in that sense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers. Mendele,* Peretz,\u2019 Sholom Aleichem, Ash\u00ae, poets, but not taught Hebrew. And it was an anti Zionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists. Anti stateism, stateists. And I\u2014 when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the infantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign. After the war ended in Europe, I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that time in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about ?

And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this Socialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed after the war. And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the senior people at the Workman's Circle complaining about it, and protesting against it, and declaring that I would never set foot into Workman's Circle activity again. Because I felt I had been misguided, politically. And just as a minor passing note, by pure coincidence, in the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists and some references in the Forward to Jabotinsky\u2019, who was a right wing Zionist, the Socialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor carrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky.:15:19 So, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just told you. And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the problem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben Gurion\u00ae and Labor and Mapai\u2019 and kibbutzim. So they printed it as the lead letter and the headline was \"Socialist Anti-Zionism \u2014 Zionist Poison.\" So, I'm waiting for the responses to come in from the Socialists now."

            "answer": "They had trained, they had trained the Jewish side of me, the Yiddish side of me and then not provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education. They were anti-stateist. They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl'\u00b0 and Weizman!! and that group also. So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it was clear that the survivors would have to go to a state and the only ones who were organizing to take them in were the Zionists from Palestine. They were the ones who were organizing the underground routes to bring them to European ports and transferring them to ships and sneaking them into Palestine. America was not open, the anti\u2014 there were no anti\u2014 there were no refugee immigration laws at the time. So, in that sense, the other thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of coming to grips with this six months later, after I went into UNRRA, I could greet the Chief Rabbi of Palestine with a feeling of love and no mixed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person.:18:00 \u2019 Vladimir Jabotinsky \u00ae David Ben Gurion ?

And I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my camp on a fellowship basis and what this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was my all inclusive Jewish quality."

            "answer": "Okay. There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly from my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or two. But a friend of mine and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to go in. And I remember us going to a naval recruiting station, oh like 1943, let's say. And the fellow across the desk is saying to us, \"Do you like a good fight?\" And we're; \"uh, huh, uh,\" and, and then he's talking that they need people for LST, for landing ship tanks, you know, to run the boats. And we leave the building and one of us says to the other, \"You know, I prefer terra firma, the firmer the better.\" So, independently of one another we were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my getting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I was in Europe. I arrived at the beaches in France, moved to Belgium. What?"

            "answer": "1944, then, September. And within weeks, transferred to, I was a replacement, transferred to the ninth Division at the Belgian boarder \u2014 Hurtgen Forest. And overnight the Hiirtgen Forest had some very special qualities; 1t was a tall forest and what the Germans were doing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the trees and detonate and the shrapnel would come down on you.:21:06 And one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded. So, that was my initiation into combat. But in any event, I guess it was probably by October began the onslaught against Germany. And I was with the ninth Infantry Division. Which it turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the area in which the DP camp I went later, was in. My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries. And life is very peculiar and funny in some ways. Anyway, so I was in battle for Aachen, Germany which 1s closest to the French border. I crossed the Ruhr River, Duren. I was in the Battle of the Bulge. We then moved into the Rhine when that was over. And we were in Bad Godesburg which is just south of Bonn. Home to many governmental, German governmental offices. And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word comes through that we've, the American forces have captured the Remagen bridge and they have sent people over it and we are put onto trucks, and by 11 o'clock in the morning we're down at the site and we're crossing the bridge under direct fire from the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Like the Palisades in New Jersey, crossing George Washington, under direct fire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the bridge. And we establish a beach head on the other side. Now, just to step back a bit, because I've since been back there and also a friend of mine in New York, was in the public relations unit of the division that took the bridge originally. And it's an interesting story about the difference between the American forces and the German forces. By that point in the war, Hitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making from his commanders.:24:04 In our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the American divisions, moving through the woods, bypassing the city of Remagen, came to the heights there above the river, they look out and they see the bridge 1s still standing. It was the only bridge still standing. And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the regimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to General Bradley!\u201d , General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says to him, \"Shall \u2014 which battle plan \u2014 shall I stay with the battle plan that we're on, or shall I start changing things, because of this discovery of the bridge standing?\" And Ike says, \"Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across.\" Now, that was the flexibility in decision making by able people. And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, \"Pour it on, get\u201d \u2014 he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, \"let's pour it on.\" And that shortened the war by two or three months. And so \u2014 and I've since, incidentally, read historical criticism of the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest \u2014 basically, as an infantry private, I adored my commanders. I adored Bradley. I adored Eisenhower. I thought they were the greatest in the world. And, and anyway, I fought all the way to Leipzig. We could have moved on to Berlin. But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't. And I, I feel great about having been a soldier. I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded.:27:01 It's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead and a standing soldier. I been, you know, battle after battle. I should, also, as an interlude here, indicate that there came a time in early April when we're moving towards the Ruhr Valley, that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to Paris. That was part of the rotation scheme. Letting different soldiers take a few days from the front line. And I went to Paris in April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended. And I'm walking \u2014 I'm choking up as I'm telling you this story \u2014 I'm walking along the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and word spread that Roosevelt had died. Again, you know, I believe all the things that the Holocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but, nevertheless, he was my Commander in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's being well led, and so it was a very moving evening when word came through that he died. And then two days later I was back at the front. Yeah. Anyway, then because of my '2 Gen. Omar Nelson Bradley This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

There I was promoted to Technician Fifth Grade. And I had terrific relationships with the military government, I don't know who. We were in, in a county, incidentally, Landkreis\u2019\u2019, at Ginzburg, which was between Ulm and Augsberg, and it happened to be the city, I didn\u2019t notice at the, time, from which the Mengele family'* comes. I didn't know this. And as part of my duties for a few months, I set up a hospital for German women who were presumed to have venereal disease.:30:02 And it was in response to the American soldiers who were, came down with venereal disease and they'd have to give the doctors the probable source of their particular encounter. And you'd get a name, and I was the chosen one. I set up the hospital and then I would drive to the particular community and try to identify the woman. I might meet with the local mayor or police chief or whoever, \"Who's Daisy around here?\" And I'd bring her in. And all the way she would complain, she's \u201ceine anstandige Frau,'>\u201d she's a respectable woman, and so on. And then I'd bring them in, go on the ward. We had a group of nuns taking care of them. They were tested. Then by three days later they weren\u2019t giving me any argument that they were respectable women. And, I remember once, a woman, who we finally discharged, came into the colonel or the chief of the group, wanting a letter that she was a her husband was coming back from the Luftwaffe'\u00ae, she wanted some letter attesting to her this and that. And the major, colonel, calls me in and tells me about it and I says, \"Look, all you can do is give her a letter.\" End of Tape #1 '3 District (German) Family of Josef Mengele 'S a decent woman (German) '6 air force (German) This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "Yeah. Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that I've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word. Which is my inspecting a \u2014 some hospital facility somewhere in this county we were in, which was a hospital for Jewish displaced persons. I have absolutely no recall about it. If you had asked me had you had any prior contact with Jewish DP\u2019s, I would have said \"no.\" Because I've been asked that question before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page memo of an inspection of this hospital. And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of Harlem hospital in 1961. It's a subliminal yearning I have. Anyway, so, anyway, that county experience was a very interesting experience. And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since when I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of places, so I was called to serve at Supreme Headquarters in Frankfurt military government. They had higher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to Frankfurt and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish \u2014 two years of German in college, and Yiddish \u2014 I was used as a translator of German documents into English.:03:16 And then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to Wetzlar north of Frankfurt to supervise the military government printing plant. That was printing military government documents. It was an old German printing force and I was there overseeing it. And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I discovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the executive director of the settlement house that I had lived in for a year and a half while going to graduate school, was in Germany, and with UNRRA and he was in Munich. So, occasionally, once a month, I don't remember, on a weekend, I would travel from where I was to Munich, which wasn't far, and I'd spend a day with him. And then, in November, I learned that he was leaving Germany for, the States. He was going into the State Department Office of Refugee Affairs and so, we rendezvoused in Wiesbaden one weekend, which was zone headquarters for UNRRA, and it was over that weekend, and his name 1s Dick Winslow, Richard Winslow. He later, a year later, two years later, became the Secretary General to the Unite States Mission to the United Nations, right after it was formed. A very able fellow. Anyway, over this weekend, he said, \"What the hell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a printing plant, when there would be so much more important things for you to be doing given your background and your interests?\" This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It had been founded in 19 \u20141892 or 1893. He had to prepare a 50th annual report. He turned that assignment over to me. I went into all the historical files and books and reports and this and everything. I did the draft of the 50th annual report. This is how he and I became so close. Then he did some revision and upgrading and this and that, and it was printed. And then I did other things in the settlement house community, I did a term paper for my master's program on city planning, on the South End planning board. A history of that and what it did. So, he had a pretty good sense of my intellectual and practical interests of experience and then the following morning he brought me into zone headquarters and Gertrude Richland(ph) was there from the Eastern Division. A marvelous woman, she just died about two years ago in Santa Barbara. She later became Chief Public Welfare Officer in Washington, D.C. And they recruited me, signed me up, and they had in mind for me to go to Fohrenwald because the then director was a Canadian woman, a fine woman in many ways, but having inordinate difficulties with the Jewish DP\u2019s. She seemed to be somewhat rigid and the plan was for me to come in, serve for several weeks as her deputy, and then two weeks later she would be transferred out and I would become the director.

We were marching thousands of German soldiers westward across the river. And I don't even remember how we got across the river. And so, I had a lot of contact. And down in the military government and in the county, I had a lot of contact with Germans. Remember, I was having contacts with the Biirgermeisters'\u2019 and the chiefs of police and the health officials and so on and so forth. But, in a certain sense, I was the conqueror, I had the power. And it's interesting to me, Katie!\u00ae, and I don't understand it considering my background, but you've seen some of the pictures. I was, here I was a private and a corporal, but in the pictures that I have of UNRRA, you see the qualities with which I express, I visually express authority.:12:03 So, you know, speaking to the DP\u2019s, you can see, I don't know where it comes from. And, SO, In my relations with the Germans and so on and so forth, matter of factly, I'm never hemming or hawing, or beating the bush, I'm always going about doing my business and I'm, I, not making any judgments about them. This individual, that individual. A woman has venereal disease, we deal with that. I was not with any group that was opening concentration camps, I was not with any group that was dealing with the SS or with the political dimension in terms of the war crimes trials that would later occur. I was not in that. Somehow or other in ways that I have absolutely no memory of, whether it's Stars and Stripes, whether American Armed Forces Radio, I learned about the Holocaust. I don't think anybody was sending me the New York Times or the Paris edition of the Herald Tribune, but somehow I was in gathering. And it was obvious from what I did with regard to the Workman's Circle, that it was, it was working on my system. And that I had strong feelings about it. Oh, powerful feelings about it. And when one thinks later about my last encounter in Germany with Dick Winslow and a colleague who was leaving at the same time, Roger Masteude, they were telling me to come in, I didn't jump at it. I asked a lot of questions. It was a gradual, two day, weekend process. I was doing a lot of soul searching, incidentally.. Now that I think about it. Doing a lot of soul searching that weekend on other matters. I was soul searching about what I felt was the inanity and the corruption of many of the American soldiers I was running into. I \u2014 at \u2014I mean, remember, I was an educated young kid, a City College!\u2019 graduate and proud of that, MIT\u201d graduate and proud of that.:15:04 And I was dealing with very \u2014 I was a private, I wasn't an officer \u2014 and dealing with these people in various situations. And that was not what was giving me my love for America. When I was running the printing plant I lived with some local group of soldiers.

My unit was in Frankfurt and I could see some of these guys were wheelers, dealers, black market. We were eating venison \u2014 where were they getting the fresh deer from? So, here were very close friends, spirits, over that weekend with Dick and Roger Masteude. And I was just getting out all the pain of that experience to them. And I guess it was partly that accumulated pain as well as my Jewish identity that finally enabled them to convince me to do this, and for me to say okay. "

            "answer": "Oh, well it's hard. It's my second nature. You know it's \u2014 people can't understand this about me, because of my secularism and my lack of the bar mitzvah. I never touched foot in a synagogue, literally, until maybe 10 years ago. It was just not part of my background. Now, I do different things that bring me into that, even though I can\u2019t believe what they're talking about. For me, it's history, not religion. And I can identify with the history, I can extract philosophical meaning from it and, belief. And be proud of that and share the pain. No, I think that this small group of people has made an enormous, an inordinate contribution to the world and to world civilization. For a variety of reasons and so on. You know, when I was a junior at college, sociology major, I was declared, whatever, an honor student.:18:06 An honor student was relieved of having to take certain courses for credit. But, in exchange, the honor student had to do a paper, a two year project. And submit it and that would complete the terms of the thing. And I did a paper on the Jewish ghetto as a form of either adaptation or a form of accommodation to the urban environment. Remember, I was an urbanist. And I spent a good deal of those two years in the library studying Jewish history. Going back almost 2,000 years in terms of Venice and Prague and other places. And up to Louie Wirth's book on the ghetto, he 1s professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. I\u2014 in 1940, 1940, '41, I was studying the various ethnicity data and the incidents of different social economic indicators and medical indicators of Jews compared to other immigrant groups. I immersed myself in that material. It was really in a sense, that piece of work that led me into city planning not vice versa. It was this feeling that if this history and this culture could lead to certain cultural qualities and changes, that made them so much better adapted to the urban environment than other groups, then maybe there's a volitional way in which you could do things in general that would improve the urban environment. And that's when I set in, I didn't know there were masters degrees in city planning at the time. I hardly, barely knew that there was a city planning commission in New York. I began putting it together in my own head. I went out, I found that the University of Iowa was virtually the only university in the country that had two summer sessions back to back. So, I applied and I went out to Iowa and I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I took a course in civil engineering. I took courses in calculus. I took courses in spherical trigonometry. In order, back then, sometime in early August, I'm in the library and I'm looking at the Sunday New York Times and somewhere I come across a little squib that, which indicates that Mass \u2014 MIT is going to start offering a bachelors degree in city planning. So, I write the chairman of the program a letter saying, \"I already have a baccalaureate degree, but I would like to enter this program if you would give me certain credit for my past baccalaureate,\" and I get a letter back from him saying oh, they already have a masters program. I wouldn't have to take the baccalaureate, he would, with my background, he would admit me to the masters program. And he was then the one, he gave me a scholarship, and he was then the one who guided me to the settlement house for, so I could live cheaply. My parents or I, we'd survive with food on the table during the depression, but that's how I got to the settlement house. And little did I know when this was happening that the chairman of the program, Fred Adams, was the son of the chief city planner who had, British city planner, who had done the major New York regional plan of 1929, 1930. And, so it was, again, it was in that Jewish context, I mean, that stuff surrounds you and penetrates you. I didn't have to go to shul\u2019! or synagogue\u2014"

You have to understand, Sept \u2014 September, 1942, I'm coming from the ghetto in East New York, Brooklyn, from the entire ghetto of my life, and I'm moving into Boston, into a settlement house, with a group, not only with the staff, that has no Jews on it, but, but a group of residents who are also living there, none of, no one else of whom is Jewish.

And I make a terrific adaptation. They loved me. I was getting such love back from this diversified group of people \u2014 all of whom were older than me. It's like what I'm telling you, what I told you earlier, about my mentors. I don't know how they, why, how they attached to me. They saw something in me. I never set out to get them as it were. And here the, we had, there was a Peruvian couple, or Chile, I don't remember. Chile. Oh, no. There was a Chilean couple, a Peruvian guy, two women musical students, one from Kentucky and one from somewhere else. People from Illinois and this and that. And they loved me. It was a supportive environment. So, I guess that experience of who I was in some way played into my ability to move into this international staff and manage with them.:27:03 Because you see, in a certain sense, intellectually, intellectually I was their equal. Analytically, I was probably ahead of most of them. Even in my ability to size up political situations. I was probably pretty good. Given, you know, given my military government experience of working, again, with the military. I haven't mentioned that the military government team must have included 15, 20 other people with whom I was relating all the time. Or when I was going into Frankfurt, into SHAEF~\u201d and related, so I had a lot of relationship experience. So, I guess I overcame the lack of administrative, working with older people, administrative experience. And I must have had some charismatic quality that I don't, still don't quite recognize, 'cause I'm insecure, Katie."

            "answer": "Well, the camp, I came in the middle of January. I was wearing a new uniform. An officer style, you know. The camp consisted of about 280 buildings. It was built by the I.G. Farben Company to house slave labor that they were employing in a munitions factory in the woods to the south. The buildings, because it was for slave labor, were not typical detached, semi\u2014 detached buildings. They, they had no kitchen facilities, no cooking facilities. The only communal facility in each building was a toilet or two. They, the buildings consisted of one large room on the top floor, second floor, and one small room on the ground floor. Food was dispensed in a kitchen area. People would go, wait on line, get food, either eat it there or come back to the room and eat it. Having gotten rid of the slave labor, the Army took over this village for DP\u2019s and it gradually became a Jewish camp before I got there. It was also cold. Bavarian winter is awful. I had spent the previous winter in the Black Forest \u2014 parts of the Black Forest. It \u2014 we slept outdoors, in, in fox holes. There was a constant flow of soldiers who, what did they call it, black, not black foot, black something or other, they's lose their digits, their toes, their feet."

I don't have much recall of that the first few days in that sense. I was absorbing.:04:51 Visiting the kitchen, seeing how they cooked. Visiting the hospital. We had two hospital buildings. And I don't remember now exactly, but within a week or two of my arrival, the, the, the cold was so substantial that it froze the pipes leading to the toilets. Four hundred out of 600 toilets were out of commission. The area of the toilets became like a cow barn, like cow barns. It was awful. It was awful. It took several weeks to deal with the pipe problem. As someone said it, \"gets worse until it gets better.\" But, you have to remember, and I'll, I'll, I'll be making notes on this along with, that that was happening to them eight and a half months after liberation. They were living under conditions like that, And, anyway, it was during that period that Jean Henshaw, the former director left. I assumed the directorship.

It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  15 There was a subsidiary group attached to the team, we had a few people from Joint Distribution Committee\u201d\u2019 attached to us, we had a group of three, four, five people from the Jewish Agency for Palestine. Remember, this is two years before the creation of the state. We're now into February of '46, and, and also because of my background, I'd never dealt with Zionists before. The Army later accused me of being a member of Zionist organizations, but little did they know I'd never been in the Zionist movement before. But, nevertheless, there's this group. And they, after, we had a large house for the team, over 20 members of the team. They came from Australia, Norway, England, France, U.S., elsewhere, I don't, and Israel, and Palestine. And we had billets. We were billeted in a large house at the edge of the German town, which was called Wolfratshausen. And, and so, and we'd have breakfast there, sometimes lunch, and usually dinner. After dinner they invite me to one of their rooms for a drink or whatever. And it was in the course of that, that I established with them and they established with me, very close relationships. But they, being sophisticated undergrounders, which I was not, at that time, start asking, you know, warmly asking me questions like you are asking the questions. \"Where did your mother come from? Where did your father?\" But that's all preliminary. They're sizing me up, could they trust me or not trust me? You're not asking me questions like that in order to ascertain whether you can trust me or not, you're asking me questions for oral history. They're asking me the questions to ascertain, can they trust me? And after several weeks of this process, it basically boils down to they trust me. They trust me. Okay. However, in underground activity, there's another rule.:10:05 And that is, you never share with anyone anything more than that person has to know. So, the person has deniability. Okay? So, I am not curious and they are not volunteering information. I notice things from time to time around the edges. Okay? For example, one of them says to me one, \"I don't know, Friday or whatever, would you like to go to Salzburg for the weekend and hear some music?\" And I say, \"Sure, but I don't have any \u2014 the appropriate papers.\" He says, \"Don't worry about it.\" And, en route, we drive north, which was not the right direction, to Munich, and we stop in front of a building and they go inside, I'm in the car. I've given them some of my papers. They come out with appropriate visa papers and all of that to cross over and come back to the American zone. We go to Salzburg, we drive to Salzburg. And we had a wonderful weekend. A month later, whatever, one of them says, \"How would you like to go to Switzerland?\" So, they were organizing my leisure time for me with false papers. I don't ask any questions. I just go along for the ride. These are the Jewish Agency for Palestine. The, Ben Gurion, at that time, was the chief executive of the Jewish Agency for Palestine. I get to know the zone chief of this group in Munich who years later, almost 30 years later, 25 to 30 years later, becomes, what do they call it, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. And, incidentally, and that's like 19\u2014 that was in '64, but then I discovered a few years later American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  16 that he lost a son, in the '67 war. So, it brings these things close to home. Anyway, that was the group. But I developed a closeness to the Joint\u201d* staff, Stanley Abramovitch was a rabbi from England, Becky Althoff was a social worker from New York, and we had a marvelous woman from Norway, Astrid Oksny. I tried to trace her some years ago and I found out she had passed away prematurely. Then in early March, the Americans are blowing up things in the I.G. Farben plant. And in the process, they destroy the water main that is carrying water to the camp. And I start calling desperately for the Army to get water tanks in and do something. We get a few tanks, the few tanks that come in we turn over to the hospital facility. But there's no cooking that takes place during that, toilets again. Then by the fourth or fifth day, I am out of my mind, and I start calling my headquarters and so on. Finally, a general appears and that leads to, but 1t shows also how in a period of crises, how hard it was to get the U.S. Army to pay attention to a real problem. And now, throughout all of this, these trials and tribulations, we also have a lot of very positive things going on. We organize a theater. We organize schools for the children. There's a yeshiva. We have hospital going, children are being, babies are being born, at an enormous clip for that size population. We \u2014 We're running an agricultural training center to the south. Where they're learning how to work on a kibbutz. Now there's little, probably a little military activity on the side, but I don't know about it. But it's a positive education of these people who until the previous May, have lived under the most forlorn situations. The children are giving performances. The adults are putting on plays and they're starting to publish a camp newspaper in Yiddish, and a magazine. And we \u2014 there's established a camp committee for self governance and there's, there are elections for membership on the camp committee and 1,000 to 2,000 people are voting in the elections in order to make the camp committee representative.:16:22 And I'm dealing with them. And we have over 1,000 people employed in tasks in the kitchen, in the warehouse, in the transportation unit, in the hospital. We're employing people. We have vocational training activity. Machinery and other things; sewing, that's going on. There are a lot of positive emotional rebuilding efforts here. But, the food is basically GI issue. It's canned. It's not fresh. They, the Army, doesn't want to take it out of the German economy. There's three ounces of protein a day. Whether a piece of canned fish or canned chicken or this or that. You have it at one meal, you don't have it at any of the others. So, a black market in food develops. And the Army 1s beside itself as if its going to destroy the German economy. But who's selling to them? The German farmers. They're probably selling to some of the military government units to, so, but in order to prove myself, my\u2014 and, basically, I don't like black marketing. I was telling you earlier how I was reacting moralistically to black marketing among the soldiers. I didn't want Jews to be involved in the black market, it offends me, it's a backwards step in community building.

Now, it occurs to me when I read all this stuff that, \"How did they get the cows into the camp?\" They were probably leading them past our DP police group that was on duty in the middle of the night. What am I going to do? But, at least once a month, I would get up in the middle of the night. All by myself. I'd drive into the camp alone. I'd pick up a couple of my DP police at the gate and I'd start driving around the camp, looking for lights in the basement. If there were a light in the basement, it meant, usually, that a butcher was killing a cow. And on the 29 days of the month that I didn't come around, word would spread in the morning, \"there's meat in 'x' building, 'x' street,\" and people would start flowing and buying meat. I don't know where they got the money, whatever. So, I'd come in and I'd confiscate the meat and I'd, we'd bury it. We didn't throw it into the kitchen. And I'd put the butchers into the brig. And during the day I'd visit them and I remember one of them saying, \"Herr Cohen, you don't understand us butchers. For us blood means nothing. The cows are yours.\" I'd say to the police, \"Give them an extra day.\" I didn\u2019t turn them over to the Army, I didn't turn them over to the German police."

I was, but, but, I want to tell you something, Katie, as I read these various memos and records, and having been in, in government for the years \u2014 I was, nine years in Mayor Wagner's\u201d cabinet \u2014 governance is constantly involving you in dilemmas and difficult choices. Impossible choices, hair-raising choices. And it's happening all the time. And if you can't make choices, you got to get out of there. You know, this antigovernment stuff, for me, is in some ways, a lot of nonsense.:21:04 Because a democratic society has to have a system where, without killing, you make choices. And, so, in a DP camp, the director has to make difficult, impossible choices. And, so, but, I don't want to get to this too soon in the interview, but, on something like April 12th of that year, a week before Pesach, I went to the Munich railroad station and I sent off a couple of cables to the \u2014 to friends in the States. I sent one cable to Dick Winslow in the State Department and another cable to William Wurster a prominent architect at that time, in Cambridge. And I tell them about the food situation. The impossibility of it \u2014 no fresh food for Pesach \u2014 we got a little bit from the Joint. And the end, the end of my sentence 1s, \"stir up the bees.\" And I get replies from both of them. But, I hadn't given it a thought at the time, but it's clear to me in \u2014 then and in retrospect, that Army Intelligence picked up the cables. And I'll come back to that later.

And now I'm suspicious, I don't know if she's my cousin or not. It would be advantageous to her if she is my cousin. So, I start interrogating her. Anyway, I don't know whether she found out about me through the grapevine, because people are always asking, \"Where did your parents come from?\" and then when they hear someone comes from that town, well, \"Oh, the director at Camp Fohrenwald, his mother comes from there, his father comes from there.\":24:00 Well, whether there had been some correspondence between her and family in New York, I don't know. She's my cousin. And, she comes from the Sheftel branch of the family tree, my mother\u2019s, the butcher side of the family, not the baker side. It turns out she has a brother in the camp to whom she doesn't talk, he's a butcher. He's probably one of my black marketers. I don't know at the time whether he's the one who made the threat. It's a small world. But, anyway, she has a sister in this camp that both of them are living in, just north of Munich and the sister has a young daughter, I don't know, seven, eight, nine, 10. And, I ask her, \"How did you survive?\" Well, what happened was, the Germans had occupied the town Ivye, and at a certain point they told \u2014 word spread, everybody had to come out to the village square with their pots and pans, the Germans needed the metal. My cousin, this cousin, didn't wait for that, she escaped into the woods and lived the rest of the war with the partisans. And her older sister must have left sometime earlier and gone into Siberia with her little girl and spent the war in Siberia. And, so it was a very moving experience. And, she has since, they migrated many years ago to Canada, Toronto, and became very wealthy. Now, another thing involving the black market, the so called black market\u2014"

Now, Malka, somewhere in this process, maybe in the woods or in battle with the partisans or whatever, lost the love of her life at the time, Bashke obviously, lost her husband. And \u2014 but, but it's hard to recall now. Malka was probably born after my mother left, and Bashke was probably born after my mother left Ivye, so there was no contact on that score. By the time they would have had any consciousness in terms, by virtue of age, they would probably not even have had any memory about my mother\u2019s mother, no longer lived in Ivye. She went, they took her to some town, I don't remember. So, there was a little talk about the family, but I don't really remember much of that. That 1s \u2014 the critical thing was, they were family, they were survivors, they had been through hell, and I didn't really find out too much about their day to day lives.:03:15 I have the impression about the older sister in Siberia. She'd be groveling in the soil, planting, picking, whatever. I guess that in those days, I, I, well, let me put it this way, what I realize now in my dotage, is that for every one who died and for every one who survived, there would really be 10 or 20 stories. So, in a certain sense there are 100 to0,000,00 stories. And we know only a few of them. And that was not an age for me when I was collecting stories and, and, in a way, it, it, it \u2014 the \u2014 it \u2014 my focus on what I'm about, puts a limit on certain of the human connections from time to time. When people want to be able to tell you and so on, and you're focused and you're doing one, two, three on the list, see? So, I don't really remember that much about that. In any event, the passage of time also dims recall. "

He was called the Klausenburg Rabbi. He was a, from a line of hundreds of years of rabbis, and he was born to be a rabbi. I'm gonna, I'll come back to this in a minute, but I want to skip to the last week or two. I've been trying to find out his first name. I actually had it somewhere on a piece of paper and I can't locate the piece of paper. So, I, I decided I would go to the Brooklyn telephone book and look up Halberstam and make a few phone calls and ask about the Klausenburg Rabbi. And what was his first name. Okay? So I go to the Brooklyn phone book, I have a 1992 Brooklyn phone book, it doesn't matter. Okay? And I see Halberstam, it's almost a column long. And what I see in this listing of Halberstams is how many have attached to their name, \"Rabbi.\" So, you know, with my statistical bent, I do a count. Forty-three percent of the telephone listings are people with the word rabbi in front of their names. That's the Halberstam lineage, okay? I use statistics to illuminate, not lie. I mean that is such a powerful fact, okay? So, anyway, we're back. So, now, he had lost his wife in the Holocaust, and maybe 10 children. This man had suffered. Deeply is not an expression for the suffering that must have been inside this man. And he was in touch with his confreres in New York, and they raised money.:10:01 And they piled all these supplies, canned food, dried food, kosher food, clothing, religious articles, books on a boat that came, arrived in Bremen. And the Army would not release the material to Rabbi Halberstam. And the cables must have flown between Bremen and Munich and New York and New York and Washington and political pressure brought on Congress people, on the State Department, on the Army and finally after a week or two, a compromise is reached. They will release his \u2014 that material to the director of the camp. So, I am once again confronted with those daily dilemmas, what do I do with that material? Can I \u2014 considering the pressure I am under from the Army on the black market, simply transfer it over to Rabbi Halberstam? So, I am summoned to his room. He was one of the very few people in the camp who had a room of his own. Somewhere I have it, well, I won't bother, but probably 10 by 10 would have been a lot. And I'm sitting across him, across the table from him, and he's in a Hasidic robe, big black beard, yarmulke hat, whatever.:12:18 Black piercing eyes. And, remember what I told you earlier, I have never set foot in a synagogue in my life to that point \u2014 nor for two or three decades later \u2014 and here I am confronting the Klausenburg Rabbi, a king \u2014 I'm an ordinary administrative bureaucrat. And we exchanged perfunctory greetings. And then in effect he says, \"Nu?\" I say, \"Nu, what?\" He wants to know why I don't turn the material over to him. I say, \"But Rabbi, if the Army had intended for me to turn it over to you, they would have given it to you directly. But they turned it over to me which means that I can't turn it over to you.\" He *6 Jekuthieh Judah Halberstam This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It would create so much trouble, I can't tell you.\" He says, \"It belongs to me.\" I say, \"I know it belongs to you, but I can't. I will distribute it among the people of the camp. You will get a good share of it, but you will not get all of it.\" He is so upset. His eyes are piercing through me. I finally say to him, \"But, Rabbi, the other people are Jews too, they have also suffered.\" He basically, didn't give a damn. I teamed something from that, I'd not encountered that before. Here I am, an all inclusive Jew, what I hadn't quite recognized were the meaning of these divisions with unbridgeable attitudes or whatever.:15:05 The meeting broke up and I left. And I knew it wasn't fair. I knew, to this day, I know it wasn't fair. The Army shouldn't have done what it did, put me in that position. But, again, I had to make a decision. I had to choose. And, and, I made that choice. I mean, I don't recall that subsequently there were any further ramifications from it, but 1t was that incident, you see. Constantly. Now, let me just say, not only was the black market, this problem. You've heard -You've about it, you hear me about it. But, the Army was also greatly preoccupied with the infiltration problem. The British clearly didn't want more Jews in Germany. And I have, I haven't gone into that here, but I've been to the National Archives and for selected weeks here and there over the last, during the last five years, maybe in the aggregate I've spent a month or five weeks of time at the National Archives, trying to get some better understanding of the context. And, incidentally, you find some very interesting material there on that. I mean, for example, you come across cables, in late '45, the State Department is cabling all the ambassadors in every country in the world, asking on a top secret basis, \"Is there any room in your \u2014 in the country you are designated to, is there any room for Jews?\" And then you see cables coming back \u2014 I don't think I've read all the cables coming back \u2014 but substantially, the answer is \"no.\" But, what you get in that period is the sense that Harry Truman and the State Department, under pressure from the British with regard to Palestine, want to explore what are the options? Then in other material, you find the secret memoranda flowing out of the Eastern countries, Poland, Sweden, Copenhagen, relating to the Zionist plot to move people into the U.S. zone of Germany.:18:51 And. some rabbi whose been to Poland, meets with the American Ambassador in Stockholm and he's telling him about what he found. Anyway, you come across all this stuff. And some of it is suggestive of a conspiracy. I've been exploring this in order to understand what I was in the middle of, you see? Finally, I don't remember the date now, there's a long memorandum, there are two I think, memorandum from Robert Murphy, whose the chief political officer at the office of military government, he was Ike's*\u2019 chief Dwight D.

You're dealing \u2014 what you\u2019re dealing with is the fact that the Jews don't want to live in a country that was a cemetery to their people, their relatives. They are fearful of the Poles because when they go back to claim property, there are killings. They know that the country is going Communist, they don't want to live under a Communist government. It's in this atmosphere \u2014 to get out of this that the Zionists are enabling. It's not a conspiracy, okay?\" So, that's at the highest level of military government. You come in at the field level, the second most important issue for this for the battalion leaders, is the infiltration.:21:00 So, they start passing rules that we can't give out food cards to people who haven't had prior food cards. We can't give out identity cards to people who haven't had prior identity cards. How do you think we feel if, 1f in a team, you all have to be Jewish if you're in this team, you're there for social humanitarian purposes. How do you feel being told you can't give out these cards to people who are infiltrating? Okay? Now, I should point out\u2014"

We were doing a midnight check and let's say, we found 2,500 people in the camp. The next morning, word would spread that there was a midnight check.

Because no matter what Robert Murphy at the top level says \u2014 remember the top leadership is smarter, they're more politically connected to what's going on in the States, so they \u2014 their attitude to Eisenhower and McCloy and so it's different at the ground. Well, let me just state something else, Katie. You're too young \u2014 You have to understand that in the 1930s \u2014 I didn\u2019t experience the 1920s, I was a child \u2014 but in 1930s and '40s there was a lot of antisemitism in the United States. A lot of ordinary citizens had anti-Jewish feelings. They're your troops. It's reflected \u2014 if you ask doctors who are, let's say, 75 years old and over, \"What was it like getting into medical school in the 1930s?\" You'll hear stories. My brother \u2014 I spoke to a fellow up on the vineyard who's a professor emeritus of physiology at Johns Hopkins, he graduated as an undergraduate in the '30s, first in his class at Johns Hopkins, was not admitted to the medical school. Went to the University of Maryland medical school and then sometime in the '50s, I guess, became the first Jewish professor at Johns \u2014 of medicine at Johns Hopkins. There was antisemitism, this is the \u2014 people don't speak about it now. I mean, it wasn't violent, it wasn't virulent like in Europe and certain various places, Germany, certainly Poland. But, there was lots. So when you \u2014 when, at the ground floor level they, the infiltration, the infiltrees, are an inconvenience. It upsets the system. They want discipline \u2014 order, that's all an occupation force understands. I, I, I, I came across a letter someone in 1948 was asking me would I be willing to lecture at some military training program in the States as part of an effort to enrich an understanding of this. So, you come into here, and it's, it's, it's tailor made for a clash. Okay? It\u2014"

            "question": "What did you want though? As you're running the camp, but you're also, you're Jewish, and as you said, you understand that these fresh arrivals could be fleeing persecution in a place like Poland. So, what do you want?",
            "answer": "Well, I want more camps. I mean it's no, no big deal. Okay? Let me, I want to address this. In Germany, at approximately the time I was there, there were a few, there were between 90 and 100,000 displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons. Of these, about,000 lived in camps and 25,000 lived outside of camps. In June of '46, which is towards the end of my stay, with the Army now for months ranting and raving about the infiltrees, don't give any \u2014 incidentally, I wasn't the only camp director or staff protesting these things. The, the UNRRA people in other places were also, we used to get together and organize group protests against some of this \u2014 but, in the middle of June, there's a pogrom in Poland, in Kielce \u2014 40 Jews are killed. I think in the next year, after I left, another 100,000 came. These are meaningless figures when you talking, when you're talking 6,000,000 dead, and 100,000 in Germany. Equivalent to one and a half percent. And if you have another 100,000, it's two-thirds of one percent, I think, if I'm doing the, no, it's two, two over 60, yeah, it's, no, it's two and a half percent. I mean \u2014 the proportion between what's happened here and the number of survivors, the ratios, makes the \u2014 you should want more survivors rather than less. And the political system worldwide has to adjust to that reality.

Could you just talk a little more about that frustration. What would you have liked to have seen happening that you could not provide?",
            "answer": "Well, you see, given the camp itself, which did not have individual kitchens \u2014 though gradually, people got cookers and things like that \u2014 I would have wanted them to move into the German market and get fresh food a year after the end, the war\u2019s ended. What are we getting GI issue for? I would have preferred that they keep looking for more housing facilities. So, in a room, in the large room, of the houses, of the houses, which could be the equivalent of about 350 square feet, which is smaller than 20 by 20, we could have as many as 15 to 20 people living. Four or five families in double-decker cots. Families separating themselves from other families by hanging blankets from the ceiling \u2014 including some single individuals living in the middle of family \u2014 and people, and so on, and children and so on. They should have gotten more housing. Reduced the population of the camp to, to 2,000 from 4,000, let's say. And the food was a problem. But they, basically, sometimes in a memo here and there you'll see, there are understandable humanitarian reasons, but then they go on to forget that they uttered that word. And it's a completely, it was a completely different outlook.:04:24 You see, you also have to remember, Katie, that the GI\u2019s were fraternizing with German girls and German women \u2014 widespread, extensive. The German types were more gemiitlich*\u00ae to them than the Jewish survivor girls and women, who were Eastern European. So, during the day you're out 1n the field and at night you're with a German Fraulein\u2019. I can't tell you whether it's 100 percent of the soldiers or 99 percent that so engaged. But, and the officers, I mean, when I was running \u2014 when I was in military government, organizing and running that venereal disease hospital, a couple of officers from some nearby battalion, got in touch with my captain asking him to release a certain woman who was their girlfriend, or one of their girlfriends, I don't remember. And I had to stand up to this at the time, to the captain, he \u2014 turns out he was a really wonderful guy, a lawyer from Florida and say, \"We can't do it. She's got to stay inside the hospital.\" But, here these schmucks are bringing pressure on us to release a woman with venereal genial (German) *\u00b0 young woman (German) This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, this was very extensive. And, I guess, the way in which I've developed temperamentally over the years, because I was a, a, what do you call it, a fast achiever, a young achiever, is fundamentally, I don\u2019t suffer fools easily or kindly. I, I have too much experience in extremely difficult situations. I know, I have confidence in my own sense of fairness and my own sense of integrity that, as anyone who has worked with me over the years knows, some of these truths about me, and I know them.:07:22 And so, when I get this kind of stuff \u2014 as my own confidence builds \u2014 I get more and more indignant. Maybe I was too young to be politic about some of my reactions, though, I don't think it was too much. There was one incidence described in the charges against me that I \u2014 that this officer says to me, something that they can\u2019t do better on housing for the DP\u2019s than they do for the GI\u2019s. And his \u2014 and I did this \u2014 the, the charges in front of a few enlisted men \u2014 and the claim is that I said to him, \"Fuck the GI\u2019s, I'm only worried about the DP\u2019s\" Now, later I go and I rendezvous with this officer, and I discuss the situation with him. And he denies that there were any enlisted men in the vicinity, in our vicinity when we had that conversation. And he also agrees that the essence of our conversation was that the GI\u2019s are young men, they're trained to live under very difficult and trying conditions, so it won't be terrible, it wouldn't be terrible if you didn't have quite appropriate housing for them. But, here you're dealing with survivors from concentration camps that have suffered so, who aren't trained for this kind of thing, who are families, children, wives. You can\u2019t make a comparison between what you do for the GI\u2019s and what you do for the DP\u2019s. So, in effect, that conversation gets turned around as a charge of my being uncooperative, using disrespectful language, etc."

With all these different charges on Zionism and so on and so forth.:13:03 I should add, unrelated to me and unrelated to Fohrenwald, on about May the ninth, there's riot in the camp at Landsberg. There's also a riot in another place, I think, Starnberg or something. Then on the evening of May 22nd, it's a Friday night, most \u2014 I and most of my team at our billets in Wolfratshausen the weekend is beginning. And, after dinner we start getting messages on the phone, there's trouble here, there's trouble this, someone is reported hurt at the German movie theater in Wolfratshausen. We send someone out to look at it, no trouble at the movie theater at Wolfratshausen. Then, at some point, I see somebody in the car area of the house, gesticulating and so on. And, he says there's trouble here, there's trouble there, I don't quite know what it all 1s, but what I do at that juncture \u2014 1s I instruct two of our staff to stay at the billets in case there are anymore phone calls \u2014 I take two people with me. I'm going to the German police station to find out what's going on. I send the rest of the staff to the camp to see what's going on there. OK? And here is what we discovered \u2014 and I'll tell you what this 1s, what this brief summary is based on \u2014 the following morning I instructed every staff member, let's say, 22, to prepare for me a chronological report of the night before, where they were a certain hour, give me a half hour later, half hour later, and tell me what was going on. Wherever they were. So I have a series of these memos which give me a panoramic view of the situation. And here is what happened \u2014 the sense of what happened. The essence of what happened. It's a Friday night, a couple of drunken American soldiers are going up the stairs of a building in the German village. They're going to the third floor where they've got a couple of girlfriends. On the second floor is a Jewish family that's living outside of the camp. They have some friends who are visiting them from the camp, there This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The American soldiers stop off at the second floor. And they start coercing the people, they move around with their knives or bayonets. They have their guns out. They're telling one guy to play his harmonica. They're asking, \"Are you Jewish? Are you Jewish? I don't like Jews,\" he says, and he rams one guy in the chin with the butt of a gun. Hits another guy in the head. One or two of these people got out of the apartment and got back to the camp. There are some,000 or more people in the camp theater watching a movie in the blackness, in the darkness. And one of them runs into the back of the theater, into the darkness, and he starts yelling, \u201cA shchita!*\u00b0\u201d \u201cslaughter\u201d \u2014 this is the classic phrase \u2014 \u201cMe harget yiddin in Wolfratshausen!?'\" slaughter, they're killing Jews in Wolfratshausen.\" And the group gets up. Now, then other rumors start. As people are moving towards the exit, that a Jew was seen kidnapped by Germans in a truck travelling south. So, people commandeer trucks and they start chasing something. They start stopping vehicles, passing and taking Germans out and beating them up. Some start moving north. I go to the German police station and I meet an Army officer there, and I tell him, we start piecing it together. I tell him, \"Look, you put your soldiers a mile or three-quarters of a mile north of the camp. Give me a chance to contain whatever is going on.\" And, at that point, I get back to the camp, and by that point, my staff and the DP, the DP police are, have a cordon and are getting them back. And then we have a midnight curfew, everybody off the streets. The official report on this incident, which I find in the National Archives, I didn\u2019t know that this existed at that time, describes the riot and indicates that there is evidence to indicate that this riot was generated by, or in behalf of, Mr. Cohen the camp director. And there is no reference in his report to the American soldiers. Okay? So, what am I supposed to do? Passive, \"bleh, bleh.\" But, but, this riot, you see, follows by 12 to 15 days, the Army effort to get rid of me. So, when the riot occurs, this officer who's writing the report, is linking it to the Army strategy to get rid of this uncooperative son-of-a-bitch, Henry Cohen. Now, from my point of view, the riot and the story, you know, some of it, beating up the innocent Germans. I cry inside, but for me it's a symptom of how close to the edge the pain still is, a year after liberation. Remember, May 22nd, the war ended May eighth a year earlier. For me it's a sign of how close to the edge. The riot in Landsberg, the riot here, the riot there. Our people are suffering. Look where they're living, look what they're eating. Look how they're being treated. And they're living among Germans.:21:02 And the Army, at that level, has absolutely no grasp, no empathy, no understanding of this. It's, it's, it's unbelievable, I can't, I indicated in that memo, here we are 50 years later, and I can't comprehend of that Army attitude. I can't comprehend it. I mean, I, I, I'm a soldier, I understand law and order, I understand discipline, I understand all those things. But, for such stupid, biased, inadequate people to be running the occupation. One worries about, one has to worry about a lot of other things that happen under their tutelage.

And she walks over to their table and she says, \"I want to sing to you.\" And Leivik says, \"What do you mean sing? Do you write songs?\" And she says, \"No, I sing.\" He says, \"You know we are in a hurry, we are doing another camp.\" She says, \"Well, you'll come a little later.\" And Leivik says to her, \u201cWho are you, where are you from? Are you alone? Is anyone here with you?\" She gave up on him, she goes against the wall, and she introduces the song she's going to sing, the Shavler, the song of the Shavler ghetto. And it's a song about a mother who has to give her child away in order to save the child. It's a very sad song. And then she sings other songs. And then she's asked \u2014 then they do ask her some questions about herself, and she says where she's from, she lost her whole family, she's all alone, she's now 15, 16, she's been to 17 concentration camps, when she was released she went to a city, she developed typhus fever there and she gradually worked her way west to camp Fohrenwald, and then she sings some more.

When I was leaving the camp, I let word out that if anybody wanted to write letters to relatives in the United States, I would take them with me and I would stamp them in New York. So, I had, I came back with hundreds of letters and many of them were not sealed, so I took the liberty of reading some of these letters. Not a single letter, that I read, was talking about me or camp administration.:04:30 Every letter was micro; what was happening to me, family, who\u2019s this, that, so on.

They live in their own little worlds. In my career as a university dean and students, the same thing applies. The students are in their little thing. They're not concerned with the dean, if they happen to be somewhere where the dean shows up, they get up and they'll shake hands with him.

Jewish leaders coming; rabbi, other rabbis coming, so, a lot of the pictures of that \u2014 I should say this, a lot of the pictures that you see at the Holocaust Museum and the ones that I have, are not really pictures of every day life or, and/or suffering, they are largely celebratory pictures; the Macabbi** games, the theatre performances, the visit of the General, the visit of Rabbi Herzog, that is, they're, they are the pictures are not really a representation of daily life in the camp. But, basically, I don't know what time I got there, you know, eight-thirty or nine o'clock, presumably, we had breakfast at our billet. Could have been one or another staff meeting, meeting with different people, you know, you're supervising 20 people, you have the hospital, you're having group meetings, you're going out to look at this or that. Occasionally, you have to go to Munich to check in or to district headquarters. I used to on occasion, visit the house where the district staff lived and have dinner there. It was an easy way, or an easy evening to compare notes on one thing or another. Also, there's a constant flow of administrative directives that are coming in. Food, clothing, transportation. There's a lot of bread and butter stuff that goes on. And, incidentally, there are times when, among visitors of the camp, I have pictures from Catholic charities coming with supplies and food. So, they were also helping out. And then there are celebratory events. Pesach*\u201d comes, you have to organize a Seder and there's a flag raising ceremony at Hochlandslager, and who should be invited and meetings with the camp committee, in groups or individually, the chairman of the camp committee who, incidentally, was a wonderful man. I used to always see him when I went to Israel. He passed away prematurely. He was, he became a high school principal in Israel. And I still see, incidentally, the two surviving members of the Jewish Agency staff in Israel when I go. And they're now in their 80s.

The two survivors in Israel, Zviah Lahar, who is a nurse, and she became the chief of nursing for the \u2014 one of the major kibbutz movements. She's now retired. And she lost her first husband in the Jewish Brigade during the war. And then she married a man, I forget his first name, Lahar and they live in Kibbutz Givat Brenner in Israel. And the other person is Liowa Lak who is really the chief of the team and a very wonderful man.:12:27 And he, along the way, worked with Goldie, Golda Meir when she was in Russia and he was helping develop contacts with the surviving Jewish community in Russia. Then he worked with some agricultural technical agency and so on. Two years ago, following the Hebron Massacre, there's a message on my telephone from Zviah, I get back to her, and Zviah is in tears about what happened. And she's calling me incoherently, \"Henry, come help.\" I mean, there was no logic to it. But it says something about our relationship. \u201cCome help, help.\" That says was that something about the sense of suffering she was experiencing as a result of that massacre. And these are people who were lost in the war and on. And, you know, you experience what we \u2014 1.e. what Israel is now Lebanon \u2014 and most of the world does not understand the complexity of that are at work here, in terms of \u2014 but I also, while I'm on that, let me before we were on camera, about Lustig saying to me, in an interview 15 years ago, \u201cYou know, Jews live in a camp. They go from concentration camp or a, a camp in Germany, and then en route to Palestine, the British get them into camps in Cyprus. From camp to camp to camp.\" And I was thinking about it last discussion I heard about the choices between Peres*? and Netanyahu*! \u2014 Likud*\u2019 Labor*? \u2014 that if the Israelis elect Peres, they will be electing a leader who because they, if they agree with him, will work to remove the walls of the camp Israel.:15:22 And if they elect Netanyahu, they will elect a leader who builds the walls of the camp. So we are still struggling with the camp metaphor, from camp to camp to camp. And I. think you know where my feelings are.

I, you know, I saw some going to America, some going to Australia, where there were relatives, and so on and so forth. But, to me, the bulk would be going to Israel.

Zone-wide, 70 percent wished to go to Palestine.\" So, that was the overwhelming desire at that time. I should add that Fohrenwald was actually the last camp closed in Germany in about 1954. At some point in the process, I didn't keep up with it, UNRRA went out of business, was taken over by the International Refugee Organization.:18:11 But, then it was turned over to the American Joint Distribution Committee and as they closed other centers, they brought surplus into Fohrenwald.

I, I wanted to mention something, when all of this trouble was developing, a number of us began to become concerned with one of the members of the team, a Dutch woman. Her name was Maria Van Bimbergen. She was supposedly the daughter of the chief justice of Holland before the war. She had \u2014 as far as I know, was the only one, one the team among the women, who had an Army officer friend, boyfriend fraternizing. And, as the charges kept flowing, particularly on some of the more confidential issues, we began worrying about her reliability. And we began complaining to Headquarters about her. And I notice in the memos that it's in my memo, and I think reference to her is also in Margaret Gerber's memo to the District director. And I came across something which refers to her at a certain date, seeing her walking in Wolfratshausen with this Army lieutenant or colonel or whatever. So, we, this was a great source of concern to us. And UNRRA didn't act on it, and that was a source of concern to me."

            "answer": "Oh, no, I didn't see it as choosing sides. I mean, some of the things that I was doing was almost measured choices, if you want to say down the middle. Like, my mid-\u2014 like my midnight checks. Or the \u2014 three o'clock in the morning looking for a meat, for a butcher, once a month or twice a month, which left them 28 other days.:11:23 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

That is, I\u2014 even with those things \u2014 the Army was complaining like crazy about me. But I think, incidentally, if you were \u2014 which you are not going to do really, but historians will, look at the files on some of the other camps. Whether or not they led to the removal of the director or not. You'll see similar themes being played out. Because I have folders based on meetings we were having at headquarters where we were being briefed about not handing out cards and new cards. On how among us we were upset by it and protesting it and so on. So, I wasn't the only one. And there was, for example, at Landsberg, you had older, older people in charge with more experience, like Lee Srole*? who was chief welfare officer. And they would get into the New York papers and Leon, what's his name, the head of the camp, so this was going on different places."

            "answer": "I think when, when one comes down to it, the most difficult thing about it was dealing with the U.S. Army of occupation. Dealing with the DP\u2019s wasn't as difficult. Dealing with Rabbi Halberstam wasn't that difficult. I mean, you know, the riot was difficult, but it wasn't \u2014 I could understand it.:14:50 And, I remember once, I don't know for what reason, the DP\u2019s went on a hunger strike protesting something. I convened a big meeting in the auditorium, hundreds of people there, and I, I set out to break the strike. And I say to them, \"Listen, I would rather be a teacher in Brooklyn than director of this camp.\" And they laugh and that breaks the strike. That was the relationship I had with them. That was not difficult. I had, I had confidence in my ability to deal with that. And they had confidence in me. I notice in the stuff around the Army effort to get rid of me, that there's a memo from Becky Althoff who worked \u2014 there were two memos from Becky \u2014 she worked for the Joint, attached to the team, and one is to Leo Schwarz, the head of Joint in Germany, to alert him to what was going on up there and enlist him in the effort to offset the Army. And the second, was talking about a small group meeting to plan a strategy, a group strategy, about * Leo Srole This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And that included Becky, some of the Jewish Agency people and one or two other staff people. And then they had a large staff meeting the following morning and they wrote someone wrote a petition or something, and there are like 18 signatures on the petition. So, that was not my difficulty. My difficulty was this anomaly of being an infantry soldier in the 39th Regiment and confronting this problem with those schmucks who have no understanding. I mean, look, one of these guys comes on an inspection during Pesach. I guess it must have been that guy who came for five days. And we walk into the kitchen. Now, the kitchen is closed for Pesach. They've been giving rations in one way or another. And, I walk with him into the middle of the floor in the kitchen it's empty and there's a pile of human defecation on the floor. And he, for him, that's a sign of poor administration and poor sanitary control. We walk to the johns and there's defecation in the john on the floor, maybe on the toilet seat, I don't remember.:17:48 We go outside and behind there against the wall, there's some defecation. The stupid guy, how does he think I feel about that? I understand how he's feeling about it. But he's not giving a thought, that is he's not giving a thought that, if I had my way, if I had found it two hours earlier, we would have cleaned it up. But the place was out of use for two or three days at the time. So, it happened. Nobody was going in there, so we didn't find it. You know, I won't tell you the whole story of this, in 1961, I am in \u2014 I'm working with my Mayor Wagner's office, I'm a senior management consultant on administration and I'm handling health, welfare, youth and so on. The Deputy Mayor calls me up \u2014 I won't give you the whole story \u2014 gives me something, \"Take care of this.\" It's about Harlem hospital, conditions in the emergency room. I've been in the mayor's office then five to six years, so I know what weight I have, okay? And I've been heavily involved for two years in dealing with various problems of hospital administration. I call the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health, whom I've been working with very closely for two years, and I say, \"Help me out on this one, I'll rendezvous with you at the emergency room at Harlem hospital.\" We go there, I won't detail what we find. At the end of the evening, 10 o'clock at night, nine o'clock at night, I call the Commissioner of Hospitals at his home in Staten Island, and I tell him where I am, what I have found and what I am doing, what I'm going to be doing about it immediately. And he raises his voice, \"What the hell are you doing there? You're not Commissioner of Hospitals, etc., etc.\" I just say back to him, \"What the hell have you known about this? Have you acted on it? I'm acting because of dereliction.\" Anyway, over the weekend, we took care of the problem and [inaudible] I report to the Deputy Mayor on Monday -\"All taken care of.\" On Wednesday, the Amsterdam News 60 comes out blasting us because it's a crazy paper, okay? Ten days later, the Mayor announces that he's promoting me to Deputy City Administrator and 10 days after that, he's announcing that the Commissioner of Hospitals has resigned and he's appointing the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health as Commissioner, okay?:21:20 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  42 So, I sort of know what heft and weight, and so on, 1s. I didn't know it all in 1946 in the camp. But, there's something in me historically, my development, which has enabled me, not that I don't take crap, but gives me some inner strength not to always put up with it. And that was what was involved here. Maybe I was too \u2014 whatever. But they were too \u2014 worse, you see. And I should add that two to three weeks after I left the camp, there was another riot situation, a march on the town, and one or two Jews were killed by the soldiers because they wouldn't retreat. That is, when facing a gun, they went forward, not backwards and we knew that. And we knew that we had to deal with them within the family so they didn't see us with guns. And they didn't see the Army with guns. And when they saw the guns, they got hurt. And I have newspaper clippings on that incident. So, I'm satisfied it wasn't a personality matter. Now, I have a memo that Ira Hirschmann, who was LaGuardia\u2019s emissary, Hirschmann had been a Senior Vice President in department stores in the '30s. He must have helped raise money for LaGuardia, later they became very close. During the war, Roosevelt appointed him with some special Ambassadorial rank to be stationed in Turkey, and Hirschmann was arranging for the escape of Jews from Hungary and Bulgaria into Turkey.:24:05 So, he was, in his own way, an old hand. And LaGuardia sent him over, he wanted to get rid of General Morgan*\u00b0 because of the British influence on the European operation. And he spent the day with me. And I quickly realized he was a guy I could trust and I get \u2014 put it all out to him. And in his memo, which is in June, \"the Army is out to get Henry Cohen.\" He starts out, \"Henry Cohen\" \u2014 this is something I didn't get until he came across it 1981, and he called me about it, that he had it \u2014 \"Henry Cohen, director, who appears to have done a heroic job under impossible conditions is now under fire from the Army. They made an investigation here, found the sanitary conditions unsatisfactory, which is correct, and in addition they felt that Mr. Cohen was pushing the welfare side too much, was neglecting the other side for the rehabilitation of the people. A devastating report has been sent to Headquarters by General McBride*\u2019, Ninth Division Commander, and they have asked for Mr. Cohen's removal. The staff has protested and the entire community had a mass meeting, as, as the people have developed an affection for him and his understanding of the problem. Not like the U.S. Army. It was two days after this mass meeting that a riot occurred at this camp. This is a concrete example of the Army bucking the job of rescue, failing to support and permit people who understand the human side of the problem to function\u2019. The people in the camp chose to go on a complete hunger strike unless Mr. Cohen was retained. He will probably be removed by the Army.\""

Roger Masteude, I was very close to him and his family for 25 years until he divorced and went west and his wife went west. But, I'm still in touch with him within the last month on the phone or by letter. So, I'm in touch, I've been in touch with a number of these people and, how did it shape me? I don't know, it probably added something to the experience and so on. Added to my heft in certain ways as an administrator and experience and politically. What's interesting, basically, is in my younger years in New York City, I really wasn't close to the mayors, with O'Dwyer*\u00ae and Impellitteri\u2019, but with Wagner I was. And with Lindsay~\u2019 I was. I wasn't the closest confidante, but I had a personal relationship with them. And, in each of these relationships, I was able at different times to talk \u2014 what I regarded as turkey \u2014 to them. If I felt it needed to be, certain things needed to be said, I would say them. And, I remember one meeting with Lindsay, had some problem, and when he left the room, my then boss, said to me, \"I don't think you made yourself very popular.\":11:28 But, to me it didn't matter, I had to say what I had to say. And, with Wagner, the interesting thing, we used to have lunch every year or two until his death, and in 1986, I think, I had, I had read a book, I had read a book about his father, the senator, and I, I realized for the first time as a result of reading it, that they were an immigrant family. You know, for me, he was Yale and Catholic, upper scale, and all that, I'm still the ghetto boy, and \u2014 but I suddenly realized that his father was an immigrant, too. And I learned about the family\u2019 And it \u2014 I'd never heard him speak about it. So, I had lunch with him in '86, and I took this up with him. And I said, \"Bob, this is the year of the immigrant, I think you ought to found \u2014 find an occasion where you can speak on the subject.\" And he did. He got an award that year from CUNY\u201d!, and the first paragraph of his speech was on his immigrant background. So, I've been able to do, to be direct. And Koch\u201d? I had never worked for Koch, but if I see him on something, not recently, but I, I might say to him \u2014 I did at dinner one night, in his third year \u2014 \"Don\u2019t you have anybody on your staff who knows how to let people you're firing off easy? Do you have to always get PR to let someone go? What about getting it once every other time, or once every third time, do you need it every time?\" Then I took up some cases with him. \"They were nice people. Why did you have to do it?\" So, you know, in the old days they used to talk about, they used to divide people into people who have the gyro\u2014 their inner gyroscope? And I happen to be a person like that. And, if you want to deal with me, you've got to \u2014 and it's uncomfortable \u2014 you have to put up with that part of me if you want to get something out of me.

But, what's happened in 50 years, as in most urban areas, 1S that the city has spread. The urbanization has spread.

So I mean \u2014 so people are talking when they're standing in line waiting for food. '\" There were programs in the community center and the theater \u2014 I don't know whether every night, I don't remember that \u2014 but, they must have been fairly frequent. On the other hand, there is also evidence that people didn't rely completely on the movies we were showing. They went to the cinema in the town. Incidentally, I, I, I neglected to say this, it hadn't occurred to me at the time, on the \u2014 at the time of the riot, one of the things that I realized was that there would be Jewish DP\u2019s in the cinema. By the time the movie was over, they would, word would be getting around. I didn't know what would be happening to them when the movie let out. So, we took a batch of automobiles en route to the police station, en route to the camp, and we stopped off at the cinema and, during a break in \u2014 when they were changing the film, I made an announcement that when it was over we'd pick them up and take them back. Most of them left then and there, they didn\u2019t wait for the end of the cinema. So, anyway, people did different things. They went to Munich, that is, they \u2014 you know, I'm not \u2014 there were\u2014"

Now, I know no one in this room has ever felt an overwhelming impulse to go to the bathroom, to urinate or to defecate. I know that no one in this room has ever had the experience of letting a little go in the underwear. But even under such pressures as that, people with an inner discipline, shoot desperately to a place where they can let go. Alright? So, one has to assume in these cases \u2014 not with the freezing in the winter, that was a different situation, I \u2014 but, here Passover, in April, one has to assume that someone or several, had certain impulses and there was not enough of an inner discipline to move them to an appropriate place to discharge.

            "question": "What did you learn from the experience? Running the camp?",
            "answer": "Well, one thing, probably, you asked me about Jewish matters before. See, I'm, I'm an amalgam of Jewish and universalist, and, and humanist. And, I believe very strongly in this. But, I also believe that one of the most powerful engines in homo sapiens is the existence, and probably the necessity, for the \"We/they\" relationships. So, when I think about the \"we/they\" relationships in the context of my being Jewish and universalist, it means to me, in terms of Jewishness, pride, fullness in certain ways, identification, values. But, in a certain sense, as \"we,\" we shouldn't kill them. We should find a way of relating to the \"they.\" All \"they's\" should find ways of relating to the \"we's.\" So, in a certain sense in the camp, the \"we\" part was strengthened, as, as against the need for balance in the \"we/they\" phenomenon.:03:20 And the Army that I was dealing with \u2014 which I don't generalize to the whole Army, became the they, more than the Germans \u2014 became the they, in a sense \u2014 and that probably does make me feel a little uncomfortable \u2014 because for me, I strong \u2014 I believe strongly that all people need to have a \"we\" relationship, but they shouldn\u2019t convert that \"we\" relationship into a hostile, hostility to \"they.\" You see? I mean, if you take for example, that thing I went through quickly with you, about Harlem hospital, where I was going in to do a lot of good, and did, the outcome in the Amsterdam News three days later, five days later was from their \"we\" into an act of aggression against the \"they.\" And it was so, so uninspired, so uncalled for. And, so you get this all the time, and, and because, sometimes it\u2019s because of the way in which they act. That is the Katyusha\u2019\u00ae rockets make our we act in certain ways. And that distresses me, even though I accept the counteraction. But, I basically prefer for the walls to come down a little bit more among people. Even though they need for their well-being, a \"We\" relationship. So, in, in \u2014 at UNRRA, because of the behavior of some of these officers and soldiers, they were building up some of the walls in me that I feel uncomfortable with. But, hell, even Rabbi Halberstam had a little bit of that, right?:06:03 So, I \u2014 but I've learned \u2014 what I've been leafing all my life, is the complexity of the \u201cwe/they\" relationships. I mean, people today focus, among other things, among a million things, focus on Sri Lanka.

Which was an athletic festival in, I don't know, probably May, because the weather was fine. It could have been June. And, we had hundreds of younger people engaged in acrobatics and all kinds of athletics and it was a really a marvelous day. [technical conversation | ",
                " This is me pointing something out to General Frederick Morgan who was the head of UNRRA in Europe. He had been Eisenhower's Deputy British Commander during the European invasion. He was the highest British military officer. And, and I took him to the hospital, there are other pictures of him in the hospital and the vocational training facilities and in different parts of the camp. ",
                " Okay, this is a picture of a Rabbi, I believe it's Yitzhak Herzog, who was the Chief Rabbi of Palestine. He came to spend the Sabbath weekend with us. And, the camp was just in a state of exhilaration over his visit because, for the people in the camp, this was a new beginning, new life. Now, I just want to point out, at his right shoulder, is an American by the name of Rabbi Wohlgelerinter.:08:48 I've never, never figured out whom the hell he was representing, but he was around all the time. Now, when you look beyond Rabbi Herzog's right shoulder, partly cut by his hat, is the Mizrachi Rabbi, I can't remember his name. He was a marvelous human being. We used to call him the red rabbi because he had red hair compared to the Rabbi Halberstam, who had black hair. Then at Rabbi Herzog's left shoulder is Gustav Lachman, who was chairman of the camp committee, a wonderful man. He became a high school principal in Israel. And then beyond his left shoulder is me in Army dress, or UNRRA dress. I should add that Rabbi Herzog was the father of Rabbi Chaim Herzog, who was the President of Israel. And, some years ago when I went to Israel, I put together an album with the pictures I had of Rabbi Herzog and I got an audience with the President. And we went over it, he was a young soldier, he was approximately my age, he was in the British Army, and he remembered clearly that visit of his father to Germany. So, we had a wonderful 15, 20 minutes together reminiscing. This is a picture of a flag raising ceremony in Hochlandslager. Where we were training some three to 400 young people as agricultural workers in kibbutzim. Standing in back of me is the Jewish Agency team.

And next to him is Zviah Lahar, whom I also spoke about before. She was the one who called me after the Hebron massacre. This was around Passover time. And again, a lovely occasion. What can I say about this picture? The thing that I always react to when I look at a picture like that, is how much eagerness and smiles are on the faces. Because that's the thing that I most want to see. And you see it in there, including that head in the back who is raising his chin so he'll get into the picture.:12:11 End of Tape #9 Conclusion of Interview This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
