ARVYDAS KLIORE
February 18, 2013
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Mr. Arvydas Kliore, on February 18", 2013, in Sherman Oaks, California. And
Mr. Kliore, thank you very much for agreeing to speak with us today.
Answer: My pleasure.
Q: Can you — we’ll be-begin at the beginning. Can you tell me when you were born,
where you were born, a little bit about your family, who were your parents, if you
had any siblings.
A: I was born in Kaunas, Lithuania in 1935, and my father was from the
AukStaitija region, from a small village —
Q: Called?
A: — near ki — 1-it’s Buteniai.
Q: Buteniai, which is near Krekenava, and — and the — th-that — the next bigger
city, I guess. And it’s between Kedaynyay and Panevézys somewhere. And his
father was the village carpenter, and also he worked on — I remember he worked on
the organ of the church in Padagai, which is a kind of historic church because it
was one of the flashpoints of the 1905 revolt against the tsar, and has since then
become a famous church in preserving liturgical items during the Soviet era. And
I’ve been there a couple of times, and this in fact is where my grandfather, his father
is buried.

Q: Was your dad also a carpenter?
A: No.
Q: No. What was — what was his profession?
A: My father was — he — he went — he was the first, of course, member of the family
to be — to go to higher education, he went to the teacher’s college and then onto the
university in Kaunas, and he became a teacher. So his — his profession was teacher,
although you know later he became more of an administrator and inspector of
schools, and then he — he was official at — in the Ministry of Education for some
time. Now, my mother was also a teacher, in fact, she was born in Slovakia
[indecipherable]. And she grew up there, but then went to Kaunas a-at the
teacher’s college and th — also university. We — we go to [indecipherable]. Also
became a teacher and 1n fact that’s how they met, they were teaching in the same
place in — in [indecipherable] in Lithuania, and that’s when they got married.
Q: Can you remember the dates of their births? That is, were they born after 1900?
A: Oh yes, they — they were born — ma-ma — my mother was born in 1908, and my
father 1910.

does not look like I do.
Q: Oh come now, oh come now.
A: Not identical.
Q: Tell me — tell me what your earliest memories are.
A: Well, you know, it’s — it’s hard to talk about the earliest memories, because I
don’t — there are memories which come and go. No really permanent memories, but
in fact, I do remember things at — after the Soviet — during the Soviet occupation we
were in — in, the first Soviet occupation, we lived in Kaunas, and then we moved to
Vilnius, where my father worked at the Ministry of Education.

February 18, 2013
A: No, this was at — after the Germans moved in and we — it’s — became possible to
go to Vilnius after that, yeah. Before then 1t was Polish and you know —
Q: I’m going to step back a little bit and get our — get some dates established.
A: Okay.
Q: PI still go back to — I wanted to dwell a little bit on pre-war. So I understand
that it’s hard to say, which was my first memory and which was my second. But as
a child, do you have any memories before any war, before any occupation? Just
something personal from your home life, from school perhaps, or children or
parents?
A: Well, I do —I have very few memories of Kaunas for instance. But do — during
the latter part of — of my parents’ life i-in Kaunas, we lived in Panemuné, which is
like a suburb of Kaunas. And I remember that, we lived in a— rented a—a-—a
house there, and there was — I remember there was a little park there with newly
planted conifer trees. And there was a statue of — was an [indecipherable]. And I
remember that — that — that — that the trees were about the same size as the height of
the statue. And of course, when I came back there 40 or 50 years later, the trees
were as high as the sky and the statue was about this tall —
Q: Yeah.

February 18, 2013
A: —so that’s one thing I remember. Another thing is, when I got my
[indecipherable] exercised a little bit when I threw a rock at the bus that carried my
father back from work or — Kaunas.
Q: Did you get in trouble?
A: Yeah, he saw it, and [indecipherable]
Q: When you were — when you and your sister were born, did your mother then stay
home and take care of you, or did she continue work as a teacher?
A: Well, she did work as a teacher at the time when I remember. I mean, I don’t
think I remember anything before I was about five years old, or so.
Q: Do you remember the Soviets coming into Lithuania in 1940? Do you have any
memories of that?
A: I don’t — I don’t recall seeing them come into Lithuania, but they were there,
you know, and I —I don’t think — I don’t recall seeing them actually, you know, any
soldiers or officials or any — cause we lived in the suburbs there then. I don’t recall
ever being in Kaunas itself, you know. Yeah.
Q: Let’s move then to Vilnius. You say your father moved to Vilnius at what point?
A: Well, it’s hard for me to say because I — I’m not quite sure.
Q: Okay.

A: But I know that it was slightly before the outbreak of the war, and — and you
know —
Q: Okay, so —
A: — and — and the German occupation.
Q: Oh, it was before then. It was before then.
A: Because one thing — yeah, one — one thing I do remember is the German army
parading down Gediminas Prospect in Vilnius, we were there already.
Q: Okay.
A: But I also remember, now that you’ve jogged my memory, that I went to pre-
school or school, first grade in Vilnius, and we had to draw red stars and — and you
know, Stalin’s picture and things like that. So that obviously was during the
Russian occupation, yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: So we were there already during that — the Russian occupation.
Q: Okay. Do you remember where you lived in Vilnius, what it looked like?
A: Yes, I— I—Ido, because, course we lived there until 1944.
Q: Okay.
A: And it was in Tilto Gatvé number 12, which is, know, a block or so, couple of
blocks from the Cathedral Square, the center.

February 18, 2013
Q: It’s the center of the city.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: Okay. And what kind of a place was that? Was it an apartment, was it a house?
A: It was an apartment, and it was one of those things typical of Vilnius. This was
not in the old town, it was in the — what’s called the new town, which is probably
200 years old anyway. And it has a courtyard, and it looked like an apartment
building from the outside, and you walk in through a little gate, and there’s a
courtyard. And so, our apartment, we walked through the courtyard, up some stairs,
and — but our windows were out to the street.
Q: Ah, to Gediminas or to Tilto Street?
A: Tilto Street, yeah.
Q: Uh-huh, so that’s a small street.
A: Yeah, it’s —
Q: Yeah.
A: And it had a lot of great little houses, most of which are gone now, but they were
still there when we were there.
Q: You — you say that you remember seeing the German soldiers marching into
Vilnius, right?

February 18, 2013
A: Well, I don’t think it was marching, I guess there were just — there was a parade,
I guess, aft-after they do — marched in. But I don’t remember them marching in. I
do remember when the war began, I was walking down Tilto Gatvé, and coming
home from somewhere with my mother, and we heard like a muffled explosion
somewhere. And I guess that was a German bomb being dropped somewhere. But
there weren’t too many of them, they didn’t, you know, mash up the city too well.
But then the Polish woman, remember running by yelling, paniczka(ph),
paniczka(ph), wojna, which, you know —
Q: And what does that mean?
A: That means, paniczka(ph) means like lady, lady, it-it’s war, you know.
Q: Yeah.
A: And so that — that’s what it sounded, but I don’t remember — there were no acts
of war in the city itself. The Germans just, you know, moved in and that the extent
of it.
Q: Do you have any memories of how the atmosphere in your home changed? Did
your parents look nervous, did they seem —
A: Well, I mean, everybody was nervous throughout this whole period. And I do
remember that there was a lot of social activity, that they would go together, you
know, and have parties, and you know, talk and why my — my father never used to

smoke, well then he started smoking with his friends, because they were — they
were always nervous and not certain of what — what was going to happen.
Q: And his job in Vilnius had been — can you tell us a little bit about that?
A: Well, he was — like I said that — at — at — at first he was ins-inspector of schools,
where he would go inspect and file reports on various schools that he was —
somebody who I guess oversaw the hiring and promotion of teachers. And then at a
va — at the la — last position he had, he was a director or deputy director for special
and vocational education.
Q: I guess the reason why I come back to this is that during the first Soviet
occupation, teachers were particularly targeted for deportation by the Soviets.
A: Yes.
Q: And so I’m surprised that they weren’t on this — that they weren’t targeted 1n this
way, that he continued having some sort of job in the educational sphere.
A: Yeah, I — and in fact, he — he took advantage of — of, I guess the Soviet
occupation to move into Vilnius because before that it was Polish, and there was no
such possibility. But I guess a lot of opportunities for people to work in Vilnius
became available just before or during the Soviet occupa — first Soviet occupation.
Q: Oh, okay.
A: Yeah.

Q: Well, I realize that the period of time that we’re talking about with you, really
will start from 1941 til 1944. And at that time you were between six and 10 years
old?
A: Right, right. Well, nine to —
Q: Okay. Nine, 10 years old. So how — do you remember ho-how life changed? I
mean, you saw — you had an image of — of German soldiers marching in a parade in
town, you have an image and a memory of a Polish lady ran — running and — and
saying —
A: Yeah, the war is —
Q: — the war is here. What were some of the other images, some of the other
fragments of memories that you have from the very first days?
A: Well, the first — it’s hard to say because na — we lived in this little street, away
from — only about a block away from a main street.
Q: Right.
A: But as far as a — a four or five year old, six year old child is concerned, it might
be la— two miles away, because you’d never get out there anyway. So, I didn’t see
very much of — I do remember, before the Germans came of — I was walking again
with the — well, we — either my mother or my ma — her mother, my grandmother
would take me for walks, you know, in Vilnius, and before the Russians left, I saw

some — right around Cathedral Square, there — there — there were a few trucks
passed with — loaded with people and with Russian soldiers with bayonets standing
in the corners of the truck. And I later found out those were the people who were
being deported to Siberia, being taken to the railway station.
Q: Did you ever walk — remember walking around in the real old town, which
would have been the Jewish quarter of Vilnius?
A: Yes, we — we do that all the time. My grandmother would take me to the old
churches, she was a devout Catholic and she would go — I remember there was — I
think it was the Dominican church, there was a stairway that the supplicants walked
up underneath.
Q: Yeah.
A: And they had little relics of saints’ blood or something like that and that they
kissed it and so on. And I remembered that — her doing that, and in fact I — I was
able to see that at one of our visits, you know, I-lately, about, you know, five, six
years ago. They’re rebuilding the whole thing and I actually got to see the same
staircase, only now it looked a lot smaller than it did before.
Q: Did you notice — I mean, since many of the churches were interspersed with
where the synagogue was, where the narrow streets in the old town were, where
there were Jewish peddlers in places. Did you notice these things? Did you notice

any part of the Jewish life that was going around? You were a child, of course, but
was that something that —
A: No, I—I don’t specifically recall, you know, seeing the — the — the Jewish life or
the peddlers or the — the stores. I— I—I guess we didn’t go into that section very
much. We went, I guess, near the Cathedral Square and the wa — or the Saint
Anne’s church and the Dominican church was in these areas.
Q: Did you know of anything, even at that young age, that there are people who are
Jews? Did your parents talk about anything like that at home? Do you remember?
A: Well, I don’t recall we were specifically talking about that, until later, when the
Holocaust started and I remember once my father saying to the Germans, we’re
offering, you know, for those who collaborate, you know, with them, offering the
chance to be the first ones into the apartments of the Jews that they — that they
deport to the ghetto.
Q: So he mentioned that at home, huh?
A: Yes, and apparently some people were taking it, you know, cause otherwise they
wouldn’t be talking about that. But my father was as — as poor as a church mouse,
but he never do — did anything like that.
Q: What a — did you ever see any Jews when you were a child in Vilnius?

like, except for one incident which does stick in my mind.
Q: Tell us about that incident.
A: Yeah. And this was something that has really etched in my memory, because I
do — I don’t remember very much from that time period, but this one of our walks in
the city. And I guess we were walking somewhere.
Q: Who were you with?
A: Pardon?
Q: Who were you with?
A: With my mother.
Q: Okay.
A: And whether I’m — and we were walking down some streets in the old town, and
at this time I guess the Jewish people were still not locked up in the ghetto, but they
had to wear a yellow Star of David on — on their clothing. And at that — by this time
they could not — they were not allowed by the Germans to walk on the sidewalks,
they had to walk in the street. And we were walking along and I saw this German
soldier run up to this elderly lady with a gi — with a yellow star on her clothing, and
strike her with the — with his rifle butt. And it turns out like wi — he was doing it
because she was walking on the sidewalk. And I remember very clearly I—I-—I-

it’s not something that you see all the time, and my mother getting very upset. She
started to yell at that soldier, you know, how can you be doing this to an old lady,
and crying. And so that’s something that I — a-an act, or a— a—a real act of violence
against a Jewish person, and by — apparently it was some kind of a guard that
walking around the streets, taking care of, insuring that nobody was walking on the
sidewalk when they’re not supposed to, you know?
Q: Did he turn on your mother, did he pay attention to your mother?
A: Yes.
Q: What did he do?
A: Well, I—I just stay with her, I asked here what’s going on, and this — she said
that these people are like beasts, you know, the — who would be doing that, you
know, to defenseless old people?
Q: But did the guard hear your mother and then turn his attention to her?
A: No, he didn’t, he just said something in German, probably something that’s like
stay out of it or something, but I didn’t understand it, you know. But he didn’t do
anything to my mother.
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did you walk on afterwards?

happen at home?
A: Well, I—I-—I suppose there was, but I don’t recall, you know, what happened at
home. The — my mother probably told my father what was going on and they talked
about it, but I don’t have that — that recollection.
Q: Yeah. What — did your neighborhood change after the German occupation on
Tilto Street?
A: Well, we don’t — we didn’t — our neighborhood, you know, the people who lived
in that — in the apartments facing that courtyard probably were the same people.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah. The only thing that I learned later, th — much later, while my mother was
still alive here in the United States, is that the building in the middle of the
courtyard — it was a couple of — series of small buildings within the courtyard,
which were quite old and I think they’re designated as historical monuments now.
Anyway, she told me that during the Holocaust, during the shooting of Jews in
Paneriai, those houses were used to — to store — to — to — I guess to — to house some
of the shooters. And — and she said that you know, every morning they would take
them out there you know, with trucks. And then in the — in the evening they would
— they would bring them back, and they all would, you know, stumble and fall out

apparently that —
Q: And the neighbors —
A: — that’s — that’s who they were, they — they — apparently th-these were people
that, I think they were called the — the Ypatingas Burys, a special, you know, troop
who did the shooting.
Q: Okay.
A: And where they got was people, and they were all young hooligans, hoods —
Q: Were they German?
A: No, they — they were Polish and Lithuanian and they were local — they were
local people from Vilnius who obviously were doing it to be able to get their hands
on all the vodka that they want. And they would start drinking in the morning and —
and — and not — and not finish until they were passed out at night, I’m guess that’s —
that’s how they did it, you know.
Q: Did your mother — did you have conversations — now this takes place in the
United States when you’re already older and so on. Did you have more extensive
conversations with her about these things, about these topics?
A: Well she — she didn’t like to talk about that very much, but of course she was

knew exactly what was going on there because this was not something like a public
record, but of course everybody knew what was happening to the Jews of Vilnius.
Q: But I mean later, after the war, when you said that when you were in the United
States, she mentions this — this incident, that these are the soldiers and they were in
the courtyard, and so on. At that time, was there more conversation? You were
already in the west, you were already — you know, it was safe and — and so on. Was
there more conversation about such things?
A: Well she — she was always very — a humane person. And it’s obvious that it was
difficult for her to talk about something as — as hag — ghastly as that, you know,
where — where you know, mass killing was — was carried out. And she — she was, of
course were very condemning of the — of the g-guys who were — the drunks who
were shooting there, you know. But other than that, oh there was — a-and — course
th-the — the whole drift was that we don’t have anything to do with them, these are

Q: Okay.
A: This was in December — in December we — we left Vilnius and then Lithuania
in December of ’44, when the front was advancing toward Vilnius.
Q: Mm-hm. What were the rest of the war years like? Was there any other
interaction with Germans that you remember? Did you ever pass the ghetto by whe
— after it was established?
A: I don’t remember that. We might have, but I don’t think anybody wanted to go
near the ghetto because it was full of German guards, and things were closed off
with gates, and people just didn’t want to get in — near that whole thing. I do
remember that I think it must have been about 1943 or so, when the Germans, I
guess in response to the failure of the Lithuanian — Lithuanians to establish a—a SS
regiment or something like that, began sending, you know, selected people to the
concentration camps. People who had nationalistic, you know, inclinations and
things like that. And a number of people from the ministry where my father worked
were shipped off to Stutthof, and you know, some of them died there. And so I
remember that for — for weeks, my father and — and his other colleagues, you know,
switched locations where they slept every night, so that they could not be easily
found if — if — cause usually when they come to arrest you they come — they don’t
go to your place of work, they — they come to — when you’re sleeping in your — in

your apartment or your house, whatever. So they — they were — well, you know,
scared of getting shipped off to Stutthof and so they — they did this. And so that
was, I think it was in this se-several, in the last months of — of the German
occupation with. Cause this was going on already and they were trying to avoid
that.
Q: Are there — are there any other memories, fragments of memories from that time,
about the war, about the occupation, about perhaps conversations that were had
about these things, that — that you can recall, when you were still in Vilnius?
A: Well, I don’t think that our parents, and of course nobody else talked to children
about what they knew what was — that was going on. Now of course, they all knew
what was going on, but they were not sharing this with us. Of course, I think that
my mother was always, you know, aghast that this was going on, you know. And
my father, you know, our — this was a time when there were epidemics now going
through. There was a typh — typhus epidemic which my sister and I spent a few
weeks, you know, trying to — to get to — Deet. And I remember that, you know,
before — before the, I guess ghetto, and — and the destruction of the Jews, our family
doctors were Jewish. Dr. Gehrler(ph) and doctor — I du — don’t remember the
name. And I think that — and then toward the end, I guess, they weren’t — they
weren’t there any more, so that was, you know.

take care of us. But I don’t — don’t know anything else about him or what happened
to him. He obviously wound up at some — in Paneriai or whatever concentration
camp, you know.
Q: Oh. When did your own interest 1n — in these events that people were so silent
about, when did it start to appear?
A: It was, I think, always there, because I knew, of course by reading the inter — the
na — the international press and — and some books about the Holocaust, and — and
the — the — the destruction of the Jewish population of eastern Europe. And of
course you would — could not see very much of this, or any of this in the Lithuanian
press here in the United States, because that was like a taboo topic, you know.
Q: Why? Why do you think it was?
A: Well, I think many reasons. I think one reason was that the Lithuanians who
controlled the press were themselves ashamed of what was going on. They did not
want to mention it or to — to — to — to even, you know, mention it in the — in their
papers. Maybe it would go away, you know, that kind of thing. Now of course,
there were some who were openly anti-Semitic, who said that this was all, you

know, some nonsense that the Jews are — are spreading, you know. But that — that, I
think, was the minority, most of them just didn’t want to, you know, hear about it.
Q: But why would they have a feeling of shame?
A: Because they knew that there was some — obviously they knew that there was
some involvement by — by Lithuanian people, not just the Germans.
Q: I see.
A: Because when you look at — at — I-I started researching this thing on my own a
long time ago. As soon as I got my degree and started working and se — then started
reading books. And when the computers came out, I w — I went to the web pages of
the various organizations that deal with the history of the Holocaust, and you know,
find out what was going on. And after — and — Lithuania became independent again
in ’91, there was — there were publications by the — the history, a kind of, I guess
history department or history institute, of various maps have to do with the history
of Lithuania. And one of them was a map of where the executions of Jews took
place in 1941. And I was amazed to see that the whole map of Lithuania was
covered with these places, which also mentioned a number that were executed in
each place.
Q: Yeah.
A: And —

Interview with Arvydas Kliore a“
February 18, 2013
Q: It’s a small country.
A: Yes. And so it dawned on me then that this not something that could have been
done by, you know, couple of hundred of Germans. I mean, they had to — somebody
had to round up the Jews in each one of these localities, drive them — march them to
the graveside, and then whoever shot them, shot them, but the — the shooters
themselves did not do this, obviously.
Q: Yeah.
A: So that suggested to me that were a lot more people from the police forces of
that — of the provincial police forces, who were involved. And obviously this is the
case, an-and I’ve been trying to find out who they were. And in fact, I’m reading a
book now by — just came out recently, I forgot the name, where a woman PhD,
Sutton, I think was it —
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Sutton, yeah. And when she shows a picture of the SS officers with the police
chiefs of the Lithuanian provinces sitting, a nice picture. And of course I— I —I—1t
doesn’t take much — I don’t have to be Einstein to figure out what they were talking
about there, you know.
Q: Yeah. Why is this important to you?

Interview with Arvydas Kliore _
February 18, 2013
A: Because I am Lithuanian, I was born in Lithuania. What happened in Lithuania
is important to me. And I want to know the truth. I mean, it’s — 1t’s — it’s kind of
hard to take to — to talk about the people who — who are, you know, accomplices in
something of this sort. But if that happened, I want to know about it. I want to know
who these people were. Where th — where the — are th-they now. Most of them are
dead, but, you know.
Q: Do you think that that curiosity, that need to know — it’s more than curiosity, do
you think that’s shared by many people in the Lithuanian community, whether it’s
here in the United States, or there?
A: Not too many. I think a lot of them take the attitude that oh, this happened, you
know, 60 years ago, forget about it, you know, it’s gone, let’s just go on with life.
They don’t care what happened.
Q: Would you — why sh — do you — I mean, this is a leading question, but, why
should they care?
A: Well, any human being should be concerned about a — a — some — something that
happened in which millions of innocent people were killed. And so I don’t think
anybody can just shake their head and — and forget about it. Unfortunately, th-things
like that haven’t stopped happening since then, your — you look at Srebrenica, and
look at Rwanda and places like that. I mean, genocide, that goes on even now. And

February 18, 2013
I think people have to be aware of this an-and try to stop it, be at — learn from
mistakes that were made, or — or they weren’t mistakes, it’s just a misplacement of
— of priorities —
Q: Yeah.
A: — where the National Socialist Order simplistic solutions to — to complicated
problems. Okay, you don’t like the Jews, the Jews you think are doing something
against your, you know, countrymen. So, of course, you kill them all, that’s the best
way to get to redress the problem. And this is exactly what they were doing in
Bosnia and — and in Rwanda and places like that, and that should be something that
people would no longer think about.
Q: Thank you. Thank you very much for sharing both your memories, and your
thoughts, and your interest. I appreciate it.
A: Well, I’m still continuing these interests. Ill be contacting you, trying to find
some more material about this.
