A: No, it was — it was a town.
Q: It was a town, mm-hm.
A: Town in eastern Poland, and so he went there in about April, and then we
moved to — to be with him in July, and of course in September first, the war broke
out, and so we were left behind, completely away from our family. And I suppose
the reason we were deported was simple. My father was a military and he was
therefore the enemy of the Soviet Union.
Q: We’ll come to that, we’ll come to that.
A: Okay.
Q: I want to talk a little bit more about pre-war life. Did you go to school when you

everybody knew by heart. And so I remember some of these — these things, you
know. But I don’t remember the daily — daily, you know, life or something from
that. I knew that I could walk by myself, and —
Q: Did you — at home, did your mother have help in running the household, or did
she do it all on her own?
A: No, she did it all by herself:
Q: All by herself:
A: And so when — when my father started working for the military in — in — in
Lodz, we moved into a military building, an-and that I remember.
Q: What wa — how wa — why is it distinct in your mind?
A: Well, it’s — I suppose because those — 1n a bigger building, you know, we were
on seventh floor or something like that, and — and it was much nicer apartment than
the one we had before. And so I remember that.
Q: Was it bigger?
A: It was bigger. And I — I remember one Christmas that we spent there, and by that
time I had the little dog, and the dog was named Tito. Way before Tito

bottom of the chocolate, and the chocolate would fall out and he would eat it.
Q: A smart little dog.
A: Smart little dog, it’s stuck in my mind.
Q: Yeah. What are your memories of your father?

thought not occur to you?
A: It didn’t occur to me at that time, but en — and later on I n — actually never did.
And my military career 1s something else, and I’Il talk about it later on.

I’m at it, what — what are your first memories of your mother, as a little boy before
the war?
A: I don’t know, I don’t really have any particular memory because she was — she
was with me all the time. I suppose when — when she took me to kindergarten, and
it would just — just happen to be that in the — 1n the building that we lived in, the
kindergarten was just across the street. And so she took me there, and I remember
her at that time. But, otherwise I — I don’t remember hearing any park — particular
thing from — from those days, that — she was there all the time. She was helping,
you know.
Q: Again, Pll ask the same type of question. What kind of personality did she have?
Was she outgoing, was she more reserved?

outgoing and sometimes she would withdraw into herself. But she was very active.
Before the war she — I don’t know how it happened, but — but she became part of a

women’s movement of some sort. And it was also kind of a mi-military thing. And
so these women were head — were having camps every year. And I remember that
we were went with my mother to those — those camps, and she was working in th —
as a quartermasters at — at the camp. And so she was quite — quite active during
those days, and I suppose she was very happy, because you know, she would do
something, so, you know, very useful. And one of these camps was — was in the
area where the president of Poland came to visit. And I remember seeing him at
that time, in nine — 1937, probably.
Q: So it wouldn’t have been Marshall Pilsudski, he had already died.
A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, he was gone, right. But 1t was — no, no, it wasn’t
Wojohosky(ph). No. Nn — he was never president. But anyways, so —

they were religious people, or whether they were, I would assume, quite patriotic
people? But what sort of stories do you remember hearing from them, and the — the
things that they did at home’? What — what were those pillars of — of identify, I
guess one would say.
A: Well, you — I do remember s-stories that my mother would tell me about — about
her father.
Q: Okay.
A: Who traveled when he was — when he was a young man, he — he was edu — being
educated in — in Saint Petersburg in — in a medical school. And then he traveled,
and he traveled through the areas through which we traveled later.
Q: So you mean through the areas of Russia?
A: Right. And the —
Q: And so you’d hear stories about those things.
A: And I remember too, this particular one, that he was — he was in — in —1n
Tashkent(ph), and that’s where we went through also. And so it was, you know, an
unusual story that the second and third generations went the same way. Slightly — in
slightly different circumstances of course, because he went as a free man, and we
did not.

A: But that I remember.
Q: Did — was there a sense of patriotism at home?
A: Yes. I think all the time, and — and especially with — with Father in the military
uniform also. It was — 1t was always present. I can’t recall any particular talks about
it, but — but you know, they — they lived through the period when Poland was born,
so for them it was very important. And they were patriots, both of them.
Q: What about church? Did they go to church regularly?
A: Yes. Yes, we — we went to church, and I — I remember — I don’t remember the
name of the church, but I no — remember where it was. And when — when we lived
in the military block, I know.
Q: Now again, this is probably not fair — a — a fair question to somebody who was
six and seven years old at the time, but I’m curious. In Lédz, which is a rather large
city, there were — there was a large Jewish population as well. And did you know of
— did you know that there were people who were Jews? Did you have any Jews who
were neighbors? Did that — did the Jewish world ever, in any way, come across into
your world?
A: Ino —I don’t go, I— you know, I — but — but yes, I — I knew that it’s a
multinational, because there was not only Jews, but there were Poles, the Germans,

the Russians. It was very international city, because it was an industrial city and the
— the — you know, with all kinds of — of people.
Q: So it was multi-ethnic.
A: But — right, but I don’t remember any kind of a anti-something, an anti-
somebody talks, because my mother was going with — with girls that were of
German origin and I’m sure they went with the — with the Jewish girls, and then so
— but I don’t remember particular that — like if there was a Jew that was visiting us,
for example, no.
Q: Well, I’m thinking, did you ever go to streets that were — maybe the baker, or
there would be a tailor, or you would see like streets that would be particularly, you
know, more Jewish, in the Jewish section of town, or — or neighbors who might be
around. That — that sort of question.
A: Mm, no, I — I don’t —
Q: You don’t remember.
A: —I don’t recall. And I’m sure, because they were all over the place.

So in — in — in my mind there was — there was no some kind of a predetermined love
or hatred of somebody else. I think it — it was just natural to me.
Q: Yeah. Did you know — did you have a sense — now again, this may not be a fair
question because I’m asking it of somebody who was seven at the time, but did you
have a sense that there were others, people who were not Polish in the city, or is that
something you learned or knew about later? When you say that Lodz was a multi-
ethnic place, and —
A: Well, I’m sure I have seen all kinds of people in the streets.

traveling, I remember when we went into the train to — to start the journey. And so
he had rented a — a — part of a villa on a hill. So in order to — to go to the town, you
had to go down the hill and — and th — and walk to the town, because it wasn’t too
far away. So that — that I do remember, and it was really a — a beautiful, beautiful
area —

because we only had two months there. But — but I do remember — I si —I still — I
still can see the view, you know, of the — of the mount — of the hills, because they
are not very — very tall. But of the hills that were — that were across the way from —
from our apartment.
Q: Well, that was, you know, the summer of 1939. And was there any sense in your
world that people were getting more nervous, or was it a beautiful summer?
A: As far as I was concerned, it was a beautiful summer. My — my father, you
know, worked and I — I do remember, I think that — that he took us on one of the —
he had to visit the camp where he was training th-the kids, and — and we did go with
him to — to visit that. I don’t recall the details, but then I remember that we went.
And you know, it — the — the area, which of course loc-located in — in the part where
many people were Ukrainian, White Russians, Jews — again, you know, because
that’s — that’s the way it was in Poland, all — all over the place. And that I
remember. And I — and I remember our — our apartment very well.

A: Well, it — we had — we had the — the living/dining area, and the — and the
bedroom for my po — for my parents. And the little — little place where — where I
lived. And then — and the kitchen. So it wasn’t very bag — big, but — but it had — had
the balcony, so you could go on the balcony. And we brought all the furniture of

Q: Would you think that — would you be able to say whether it was a well-to-do
area of this town?
A: That I wouldn’t — I don’t think so, because my father was just living off of the
military pay, and it wasn’t that much. But — but apparently the apartment was
affordable, and you know, th-the owner had built the — the villa several years ago,
and my father apparently found a space, and that’s where we moved in.
Q: Mm-hm. And the name of the town again was?
A: Dolina(ph).

know, of course, it’s several months, you know, that it — but he was reassigned to go
to his regiment, and it was 27" regiment of — in the army. And so he left, maybe
two or three days after the war broke out.

A: Early September. And by that time I — and I do remember when later on there —
there was a lot of mil — you know, people and military, they were moving out to — to
go to the border and go to Romania and go to — to Hungary. So I remember these
transports and transports and transports of people on the — on the — you know, horse
driven carts, and military walking. Thousands of people just moving out. That I —
that I’m — that was even before — on the — of cour — of course before the Russians
came in.

Hungary? And was it close to the border of Soviet Ukraine? How — was it is — a

Poland was like this, and this thing goes straight over here, you know. So it was — it
was called Do-Dolina(ph) Koa(ph) Stanislawowa (ph), and the Stanislaw6wa(ph)

A: And now it’s called Ivana(ph) Petrowsk(ph) in — you know, in the Ukrainian.
So apparently it wasn’t too far away because people who were just walking, you

attacked, of course they’re moving very fast, and the Russians — on the 17" of
September the Russians came in. And my father came back to us after the Russians
have occupied our area. And he was wounded. A shrapnel had hit him in the leg,
and so he was wounded, and he came. I don’t know how, but at that time the border
was still kind of fluid.
Q: Permeable, mm-hm.

And he was wounded, and — and I remember that somehow they found out that he
came back. And the Russian military people came in, and they saw him, and they
saw him being wounded, and they said, well, we’ll — we’ll send you a doctor. And
the Russian doctor came in and was tending to his wound. But my fa —

really very well dressed, but there were plenty of them, so — and they were armed.
So that I remember, their — their coming over, you know, transporting —
Q: Right.
A: — themselves into — into Poland. And then ma — somehow, I don’t know, they alt
— already the underground system must have started, because my father decided that
he’s not going to be waiting until she — he 1s well, so they can take — take him — you
know, the Russians can take him. So he decided to escape.
Q: Okay.
A: And he left us, and went toward the border, and there must have been some kind
of, you know, group of people that was being formed, and apparently they were just
caught on the border.
Q: Okay.
A: And he was brought back into our town, which of course we didn’t know. But
sometime later, his barber, who was a Jew, came to my mother and he said, you
know, my — my cousin is working as a guard 1n — 1n the jail, and he told me that
your husband is in jail. And he also said that if we wanted to visit him, he will
permit us to get in, provided it’s four o’clock in the morning.

A: Of course, he was no — no military uniform, he was dressed up in some kind of a

that, you know. But this was the last time we saw him, and as I said, it was probably
the — towards the end of 1939. And then we were told that all the prisoners were
being transported away from — from Dolina(ph). And several weeks later my
mother went to Stanistaw6wa(ph), to the larger town, to inquire about what

occurred, and he was taken out.

how long the meeting lasted?
A: No, I don’t remember the — the — the words that were exchanged, but it lasted
about 15 - 20 minutes, no longer than that, because you know, the — th-the fellow
that was the to — that permitted that, was taking a very great risk.

there were a lot of communists, Polish communists or Ukrainian communists or
Jewish communists. And those people would — did go into cooperation, so you
already didn’t know who you can trust. We apparently trusted my — you know, the

Q: What was your mother’s demeanor like during these — these months? Did she
seem to change for you, or not so much?
A: No, I—I- she was apparently a strong character. And so somehow she accepted
that, you know, and when she was born and — until 1914, that part of Poland was
under Russian occupation, all — you know. And so she was not shocked by — by,
you know, being under Russians again somehow.

about your mother, and her knowledge of Russian, or lack of it and so on, and that
she was not unfamiliar.
A: Right, but — but she — I don’t know, maybe she was just simply not the type to
learn other languages. She did learn some sp — some French, and — when she was in
school, but apparently she had enough to get by when we were finally required to
speak Russian. But — but she did not become fluent, you know. Probably enough
words to — to get by. And the Russians and Polish are very similar, so you could
really understand without having to really learn the language. And that’s the way
she was.
Q: Okay. So your contact w-with the Russian military authorities sounds like it was
rather minimal. It was when they came — the doctor came to look at your father’s
wound, and then your father left, and — I should say Soviet military authorities, not
Russian military authorities.
A: Right.

Q: Did people have cups with them? In — did you —
A: You — if y-you better had something on your own. So that was the only liquid
that we were given, and they apparently must have stop on their own — on the — on
the way wherever they stopped, to give us some bread. And in general, in Russian —
in Russia that’s what you — if you’re lucky, you eat bread, not like this one 1n here,
but — but you were lucky if you — if you got, you know, a hundred grams of bread a
day. And that’s the way we were fed.
Q: Did — were — did everybody survive the three weeks?
A: Yes. Which was very different from the first deportation, where people were
deported in the middle of the winter. And in that time, many old people, many
children have died o-of — just froze to death. I-In our case no, because it was — you
know, already spring.
Q: So you don’t remember the cold —

A: When — when the — you know, the Russians started the killing of the Ukrainians,
and they just simply starved them to death. And I think it was just like nine million
people di — that starved to death, because they started rebelling against the, you
know, Russians taking their soil, their land, their — their things. So they became a
part of this group that lush — Russians, as they say, pacified them by transporting
them into the Kazakhstan. So — so they fully realized what we went through,
because they went through it. So they were very kind, very friendly, you know, and
— and opened their house for us.
Q: Isn’t that interesting, given that there had been tension and conflict between
Ukrainians and Poles historically —
A: Right.
Q: — particularly in the border regions. And it’s — kind of — feels almost like grace,
that you — your destiny brings you to a place where you have people who
understand what you’re going through.
A: Right, you know, and in — and I — I don’t to — I don’t think there was any
Russian normal person that did not go to some kind of something like that. And

A: Father Stalin. He was father of the whole Fatherland. So, you know. And it’s

my mother was working, so she was entitled to — to some kind of a ability to get

A: Most of the people in the Soviet Union are hungry. If you survive on a piece of
bread that’s about that size, you know, of loaf of bread, and maybe little bit of
vegetables, or something that, you know, that come out your way, yes, you are
hungry all the time. Maybe you’re not starving, but you know, you don’t — you
don’t — and there’s not much — not — not mu-much else to eat. And you just — so you

hours he comes back, he’s — his mouth full of — of you know, wolves’ —

I read many books later on, that — it’s the same thing is written in — in many books
or people that were actually in jail, they were — they were, you know, under — under

Q: So, you were there at least through the school year. What about the summer of
1941? Where — in June 1941, the Soviet Union is attacked by Nazi Germany. Did
you find out about that in this remote, remote place?
A: Apparently yes, later on, because you know the — th-the newspapers would
arrive there from time to time, and th-they would learn from the Russians we would
— we would find out. But it wasn’t until later, of course, that it came to us somehow,
you know, through word of mouth or whatever, is that — that there — once the
Russians were attacked, and the Germans were moving very rapidly, th-the
Russians somehow managed to make contact with the — with the west, with the
British and the Americans. And they formed a ali-alliance all of a sudden. And so,
because they — they couldn’t have enough equipment, you know, so the — so the
British and the Americans started supplying them with — with the military
equipment. And at that time, of course, the — the relationships between the Soviet
Union and the Polish government was broken in 1939, and we didn’t have any mu —
a-any diplomat relations with — with them at all.
Q: Wa — explain how there could be a Polish government, where was it?
A: Well, in —1n 1939, as I told you, there were people, hundreds of people,
thousands of people moving out of Poland, going — going south. The Polish
government also left. And from — from Hungary they were then transported to

France, and they f — reformed as a — as a new government representing different
political parties. Then es-established this — themselves in France, and they started
building up Polish military, because there were a lot of people that were escaping.
And that — they somehow managed to escape then from — from — from Romania

were — were in — were — what do you call it? Were not participating in war, they
were — they were neutral. So they — by the thousands they just run different ways.
You know, the — the roads opened to Italy and — and all kinds of places.
Q: So this is where your father had hoped to be able to land.
A: That’s what he was hoping, that he’s going to — to end up. And so they formed
military units in France. And then, of course, when France was attacked, they did
give up even sooner than — than Poland did. And since we had an alliance with —
with the British, the British had evacuated Polish troops from France, into
England. And this — so the Polish government had reestablished itself in England,
and upon British insistence, the Soviet Union, because I don’t know exactly what —
what was the — the — the words, but they said, you know, okay, we’ll — we’ll qui —

the Polish government in — in London.
Q: So it’s the Americans and the British who are saying this to the Soviets?
A: Right. They said, you know, wis—we’ll help you, but — but you know, you
saying that you don’t have enough troops, and blah-blah-blah-blah, this or this. But
you know, you have — you have maybe couple hundred thousand troops that you
have arrested when you came into Poland. Because that’s what happened, you
know, because the units that were located in — 1n the east, they were all, you know,
taken over by the Russians, and by the thousands they were deported to Russia.
And as you probably know, the — the — many of the officers and — and a — and a --
leading classes, like judges and teachers and things, they were — they were arrested
by the thousands by the Soviets. And — and then the Polish officer corps, at — at
least they know about 20,000 that were killed in Katyn, which was several times
where they decided to liquidate the Polish military prisoners of war, which was
against, you know, the Geneva Conference, of course. But they killed 14,000 that
was known, that — that were — that — that were killed.
Q: Do you think your father might have been amongst them?
A: I don’t know. I don’t think so, I don’t think so, because those were the officers
that were — that were arrested as — as they gave themselves up to — to the Russians.

government in exile made with the Soviet Union, and what was going on, you
know, in those — in those immediate days and months. Before we get to that, I want
to know, did your — did you make friends, did your mother make friends with other
Poles while — or other people while she was in the Soviet Union? You had
mentioned before that people were very distrustful, and kept a distance between
themselves. Was there ever any exception to that, when people bridged the gap?
A: Well, in a way, but you know, it — it wasn’t — it wasn’t a friendship. You just
don’t develop friendship all of a sudden like that. It was — 1t — it was a— a kind
feelings towards us, und-understanding feelings, that they know what we’re going
through because they have been through it.

was g-good relationships, let’s put it this way.
Q: And what about other deportees. Di — do you get to meet or get to know, in any
way become close to other deportees?
A: Yes. The-These — these were — these were your — your people, and so, you know,
and — and since we are in the same village, and well, like I said beginning that we
lived in with two other families in there. So — so you developed this kind of
friendship. Which lasts — I have friends now that — that I — not too many, I —I
haven’t — those that I met in the Soviet Union, they all went different ways. But the
ones later on in Teheran and Iran, I — I ha— I maintain friendship with those
people until now. And I — I remember an — an incident when I was working for steel
—U:S. Steel Corporation, and I was traveling throughout the United States, and I
— so I—I went — I was going to Cleveland, and I told my boss, I — I said that’s
great, because I have a friend in Cleveland. And then a few months later, I-I was
going to Philadelphia, and I said, oh, it’s terrific, I have a friend in Philadelphia.
And then I’m going to San Francisco, and he says, if you tell me that you have a
friend in San Francisco, I won’t believe it. And I said, but I do. So he said, how in
the heck could you guys do that? Well, you know, I have a friend that I just talked
to just recently who — who lives in — in Argentina. I have friends in Australia.

don’t you arm them? Oh, we don’t have anything to do. So the British said, well,
then you release them. Let us take care of them, let us arm them, and they can
become a part of the second front when we finally open it. So, by miracle I suppose,
Uncle Stalin decided that yes, okay, we will do that. And we were released. And so
military started moving [indecipherable] troops.
Q: So the first — the first thought had not been to release all of — not — not allow
anybody to leave the territory, but just grou — regroup and form a military unit.
A: That’s what — that’s what even the Poles wanted to do, because of what — they
wanted to fight for Poland, you know, as when the Russians are —
Q: Right.
A: — going to start pressing westward, they will part of the — of that system. But the
Russians didn’t trust them, because they were all anti-Soviet. Many of them had —
had fought in the — in the war of 1920, when the Soviets started pushing into
Poland, and were defeated, luckily. So — so the — all these troops were enemies.

Ghazir, there was one in Zouk and there was one in — 1n the mountains on the other

Q: Did you also have much contact with local people? Lebanese?
A: Oh yeah, yes, you know, I — in a way that th-they were friendly people, and th-
they were — they were really amazingly capable of learning languages, because you
know, they had a long history of being traders. And so this — so this became a
natural with them. So most of the people that had any — any shops in like — in
Ghazir, they s — they spoke adequate Polish to tell you that, for example, they
would c-call, pig missus, pig missus. It wasn’t that the missus was a pig, but they
killed the pig, and they were selling the meat. So — so — but — but they were very,
very nice, very polite, and a friend of mine who lives in Australia was telling me
years later that she moved to Australia and — and she met a — an Arab from — from
Ghazir. And so she — the — he emigrated after her, and they got married in — in

she was busy all the time. You know, she — she had things to do.
Q: Did you ever see her, in all of those years, those 10 years, did you ever see her
despair?
A: No. I think after you go through something like that, you could have done all the
desperation in two years. The rest of it was a wonderful life, basically. You know,
of course you didn’t know anything about your husband, you were lonely, no
family, and — but there are people like you that became, you know, part of your
circle. And so she never despaired, and — and | think she — she was — she was too
busy to — to think. And then besides, she could — she could, you know, embroider,
so she would embroider. She wrote poems, which — which I have, you know. And

territory of the — of Great Britain.
Q: Had you been trying for a long time? Had your mother been trying?
A: No, no, this was all done between the Polish government and the British. They —
they realized that they have to remove those people from Lebanon because they
had — they had an agreement that they won’t work. So what do you —
Q: Well that can’t happen forever.
A: No, that can’t happen forever. So they decided that the best way is to simply
bring them to — to real life. Really real life, not what we have for life for the last
number of years. So, we were load — loaded on the shi — on the military ship. And
you know, on a transport ship in Beirut, and moved across the Mediterranean Sea
and up north to — to Great Britain, and we were unloaded with — in the — the port
of Hull, h-u-l-l, and then transported to a military camp, a post-military camp in

to London, I was with Rilka(ph) for a little while, and then she arranged for me to

there is some factory that you can go in. So I went for an interview and the
gentleman that was interviewing me, he said, what do you want to do in life? And I
said, what — I would like to be an engineer. And he says, oh, I’m sorry, I’m looking
for a worker, not for an engineer. So —

there is — there is a — an office of a — of a— a Polish American, who was born in — in

in the Polish corps of engineer in — when — during the campaign in — in Italy, and
there he met a British engineer who was working for the British corps of engineers,

school, there was an Polish engineer who taught the boys the drafting. So I knew
about eng-engineering drawings, I knew about drafting, I know about, you know,
things. And so he gave me the opportunity to work for them, as my first engineering
job.
Q: Oh, how wonderful.
A: And it was really fantastic, because, you know — but my mother told me in the
beginning of my career that, just remember to — when you work for someone, take a
letter of recommendation from the person. And so they — so I— when I was in
London mat — from — I think from September or something like that, and we left for
the United States in the beginning of February —
Q: Which year?
A: — of 1951. So we were in England only several months. And what happened is
that my mother had ta — three uncles. My — my grandmother came from a family of

says, are you a U.S. citizen? And I said no. So he said, oh my God. He runs to the

two weeks, I was shipped to Frankfurt, Germany, where the American consulate
was, with two sergeants that swore that they knew me since.
Q: And they had never seen you before, huh?
A: No. And I was given the U.S. citizenship. So — so — so when I came back from

A: — a registered citizen. And — and it really helped me quite a bit because sometime
later the same sergeant comes in and he says, do you speak a little Russian? And I
said yes, I do. And he says, oh, would you like to go to a refresher course in

you ever make the sculpture of Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus? And he says, no,
but that’s interesting. He says, come, come, come, come. So he took me to his — to
his workplace, and he starts pulling out the books, trying to figure out, you know.
And he finds a — a picture of lady — Our Lady feeding the baby Jesus. And he says,
you know, Pll —PIl—TIl put you on rock — o-on the rock and — and
[indecipherable] this, and she’s going to be feeding baby Jesus. Is that — is that
what you want? Excuse me, ca-can you sneak out and go and get that sculpture?
Q: Can you cut the panel, please? [break] And so, what’s that?
A: So this 1s the — this is the sculpture that he made.
Q: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.
A: And — and th-there are only two of those like that. One painted, and the other one
just as in wood. And he sent me both, to — to the — to — to Nuremberg, and he says,
which one do you want? And I bought both, and the other one I send to my cousin
in Poland. So they have that.

And so, this 1s what — what I remember from Oberammergau.
Q: From Oberammergau. Well, thank you for sharing that. That — did you explain
to the people where you were taking the Russian refresher course that — how you
came to know Russian to begin with?
A: Yes. But, you know, that — basically, you know, I — I found out that most
Americans are not interested in that, because it’s — it’s so far away from their
background, from their pe — that you s-simply do not understand, that how in the
heck — excuse me — my English — you can come to somebody’s home at two o’clock
in the morning and take him away, and leave everything — you know, you leave
everything behind. It was just in — incomprehensible. And so there — they were not
interested. And so therefore, you know, I just kept it to myself, and I don’t have
anything against it, because it is so different. You know, how do you explain to — to
people that never experienced any kind of a — of [indecipherable] with authorities,
that somebody can come to your house at two o’clock in the morning and take you

— to these guys, and they accepted what it was.
Q: Was there a reason why they would have wanted you to take this Russian
refresher course? Did they have anything in mind for you?
A: Well, because I was wer — working for the regiment.
Q: Okay.
A: And the regiment was on the border, so they needed people that were familiar
with the language, just in case —
Q: I see.
A: — 1f some — something should happen, each unit had a translator that could
interrogate the people. And here’s a guy that not only that experienced being there —
Q: Yeah.
A: — and knowing the people. And so I was very grateful. But then I suffered some
— somehow, later on, because whenever we would go to Canada, and I take my
citizenship papers with me, I was always stopped on the border, and I — and there
was also a telephone call made to Washington, because my — my paper, my — my
citizenship paper is not the normal thing. It does not have my photograph, it does
not have sig — signature of — of — of a judge. It has a signature of Consul General of
the United States and Frankfurt, Germany, and it just doesn’t sound normal. So —

A: And I did and ever since then I was — it was okay.
Q: Okay.
A: So, you know, a-all these experiences add up to — to a— I would say a rather
interesting life, if you want to call it that way. And then, when I was drafted into the
army, I decided to move my mother to Chicago, because here we — we have many
more friends and people that we — acquaintances that we had from the past. And so
I moved her, and then I went back and was drafted. And when I was released I came
back, and I restarted my studies at Illinois Institute of Technology, and I started
working as a draftsman for engineering firms. And my first firm of employment
was a fi — was a firm of — in — in which our chief engineer was Lithuanian. And
most of the draftsmen were lith — were Lithuanians. So, that was my — my

A: — of Lublin, and a new army. And that army fought with the Soviet Union, and
a — you know, participated in the liberation of Poland. And of course, the Anders’

experience, too, because we — there were five offices like that, and Chicago office
had the Middle East — the mi— mi — middle west.

know, but there are hundreds of dams that are run not only by the Corps of
Engineers, but also by private industry, where they have, you know, hydraulic
facilities. And because they — they are using the waters of the United States, they
are obligated to take a license and to fulfill the requirements, and we would go and

thing to do every time you go, cause it’s different.
Q: Did you think much about those two years of deportation throughout your life, or
do you kind of push it to the past?
A: I try to push it to the past, because I don’t think that — well, it’s not my nature,
you know. And — and besides, I’ve read so many times when people are reliving
their — their past, and especially if the past is not a pleasant one, you are unhappy.

Q: You mean on the attack on Germany.
A: When they attacked the Germany, and then — and then they occupied the Polish
territory, all the people from the underground forces, all the politicians, whoever
they could put their hands on, were deported again, so that that was in 19 — you

you know, there’s — there’s something through your life experience that can tell her
something about you, and what would you want her to know?
A: About the world.
Q: Okay.
A: That there is a greater world that one should visit. About the people, that you
should not be locked up, that you should be open for other people. And that — and if
you are open for other people, even if the — if there are people that are against you,
you can brush them aside because there are other people that will be friendly
towards you. I think that’s important to know, because I experienced it, you know,
the — the — the Cossacks, the Uzbeks, the Iranians, the Lebanese, the British, you
know. The-These — these are experiences, because all th-thi — all this expands your
brain, and makes — makes the world smaller, and larger at the same time, and makes
you appreciate different cultures without having to remember the bad things. And I
think that’s very important that — that you should not carry something that happened
200 or 500 years ago, and you still — you — you still kind of have some hatred tow-
towards the new generation that doesn’t know anything about it. And I — I think it’s
important, because if you don’t practice that, we’ll always be at war. And I think
that’s important.

was a marvelous, wonderful figure. So the boy just pulls away from his — from his
mother’s hand and runs to the officer and offers him the only thing that he has in
life, an apple. And the officer smiles at the child, takes the apple, bends over, grabs
him by the hands and — and kills him on the spot. How do you explain that? How do
you explain the fact that pole — no, hun — thousands of Polish officers were
murdered by NKVD, by killing them with a bullet in his — in the back of their head?
You know, it was just a very simple thing, right. Next, next. Then you go home, you
have supper. You put your child on — on your lap, tell him the story. And next day
you go and do the same thing. Impossible to believe that human beings are capable
of that. Am I to — to — to remember all these things all the time, and accuse all the
people of the — being possible to do that? No, it — 1t was circumstances. But
circumstances like that, there are hundreds of them, you know, that people can be

You know, and all in the name of an idea that — that these are bad people, and that
you have to get rid of them because — because you are looking for lebensraum,
which is the space, you know, living space, the Germans were doing it. They were
going to liquidate the Poles, and they were going to liquidate the Russians, because
they were going to take over all this territory and form a thousand year old Reich,
you know.
Q: The idea.
A: That was the idea. And — and many of them went for it. And then when I was in
Germany in — in — in 1955 or ’56, it was all gone. They were all back to normal
people, you know, and you — nobod — nobody knew. They just didn’t know that
something like that was happening. Which is, of course, something else. But — but —

willingness to come to places like — like my home. Yes, you must, but not that you
have to, you must remember that. And you must teach that to the next generation, so
they don’t repeat that kind of mistake. And I think, if we learned any lessons, then

maybe the sacrifices will bear fruit. But the — the only thing we have to do is to
make sure that somehow we convey it to other generations, you know, and they
remember that human beings are capable of these unbelievable atrocities, all in the
name of some idiotic idea, or — or in the name of Bachkastani(ph), who — who
killed his own — he had the problems in the beginning of — of the — of the war when
he waged war against Germany, because before, in the 30s, he killed all the
officers’ staff.
Q: You’re talking about Stalin, yeah.
A: Yes, you know. And so — so, you know, because you don’t trust anyone, even
the people that were with you all this time, helping you to get to the top of the pile,
and then you kill them because you mistrust them.
Q: Yeah.
A: And — and I think this is the si — this is the something that — that will — we should
be able to convey to other generations, that you know, please don’t become one of
those. Be a human being. Be a loving human being and — and don’t persecute your
brothers.
Q: Well, thank you. Thank you for sharing your story with us today. Thank you for
the energy and the time and the attention, and we’re very, very grateful.

A: Well, tha — and thank you for coming, because, you know, I — I — I wasn’t going

Q: I appreciate that you have. I appreciate that you have.
A: Well, thank — tha-thank your museum, really seriously.
Q: I will.
A: Thank you.
Q: And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview
with Mr. Witold Pawlikowski on January 19 — excuse me, January 21“, 2015.
Okay, so Mr. Pawlikowski, now I want to talk to you a little bit about the
documents here that you have on your lap. Have you ever seen anything like this
before?
A: No, I haven’t. Because I d — apparently these were filled out by my mother
somewhere. I don’t rem — I don’t see the date. But it says that it’s a displaced
person registration record, which — which shows the registration number, and my
mother’s name, place of birth, religion, the father’s name, mother’s name and last
place of residency in Poland. And okay, thank you.
Q: And there’s one for her and I believe one for you as well.
A: There’s one for me, which is — which is I’m really grateful for that, but this a —
cause I didn’t even know that — that something like that exists.

Interview with Witold Pawlikowski
January 21, 2015
Q: The third page is part of the listing in the list on the [indecipherable] boat that
you took to the United States. Your names are down there.
A: Right, my names are — are here, and my mother’s birthdate and place of birth,
and — international ref — refugee organization travel documents are issued in Beirut.
So this is the — the register of the — on the ship that — that — which we took to — to
the United States, which is really something. You know, they just simply didn’t
share these documents with us, you know. Maybe they would have if we asked for
it, but — and — and these are also some registration cards.
Q: For you and for her?
A: Date was 4-9-1950. So this was when we apparently are leaving Lebanon to go
to England. Yes, last occasion Beirut, Lebanon, and destination England, on SS
Oxfordshire.
Q: You know, it’s interesting that I fou — I got those documents after I got the
questionnaire that you filled out. And as I was looking through them I said, this
confirms everything that you told me in the questionnaire, everything that you
wrote in the que — now, one wouldn’t doubt it, 1t’s simply —
A: You do have documentation of it.
Q: We do have documentation.
A: Right.

Interview with Witold Pawlikowski
January 21, 2015
Q: Yeah. So what does it say? Does it — does it have a meaning for you when you
see something like this, 60 — 70 years after the event?
A: Well, it’s just like what you said. It — it really shows the documentation that I did
go through those things. It’s not only the Stalin’s picture that I have to show you,
but — but there is actually documentation. Of course, we don’t have any
documentation from the Soviet Union, but — but this is — is a— a wonderful thing,
and this — this is application for assistance, whatever that was. And it was 1947, so
we were in Lebanon at that time. And this must be the — when international refu —
refugee organization had taken over, and my mother had to fill this out. So — and
this also is a recommendation from England, from the Polish hostel in Lothian(ph)
Park, Pendred(ph) Cumberland, that my mother has left the camp to go to a
hostel in Liverpool, and was due to sail for USA on the following day. So this is
confirmation that we did travel on Her Majesty’s — because Her Majesty paid for
the trip.
Q: Ah, to the United States?
A: Mm-hm.
Q: What would you say to other people? Would you say that it is worth them
making an effort to find out th — you know, about such documents?

A: Oh yes, I would say this — this is fantastic, and I— you know, maybe it is my
fault, maybe I could have inquired myself, but —
Q: But you may never have known of its existence.
A: But [indecipherable] of the existence of something like that, you know. I mean,
something that says that she left in feb — second February for the Danfield Lane
Hostel in Liverpool, and then — you know, and — and this is the international
refugee organization which — I — I — I have to read it, but —
Q: Of course.
A: — but it’s a statement of my mother, that she had to sign, that she waives and
surrenders any rights and claims of demands of any blah-blah-blah, whatever.
Q: Some official language there.
A: Some official language that I would be glad to — to read, but you know, we are
really grateful to — to — to the fact that such an organization was formed, and helped
not thousands, but millions of people to go back and to start life again, in a normal
life. Not the place where you see somebody hitting a child’s head on the — on the
pavement, but normal life, and you can appreciate that and — and you know, that’s
why I want — when I came to the United States, I tried to every — you know, to — to
do everything I can not to go against the law. I was never arrested. I did not use
drugs, because life was too dear to me. And I —I think that’s important to know,

that you just live once, and you live for a very short period of time, and it is much
simpler to live a simple life, a normal life, where you have family, where you have
— you go to church, where you worship, where you remember that it — 1t was not
your doing that you were saved, it was something else. And then I think it’s — that’s
very important how, even though you have no proof, cause you — cause you been
just, you know, right place in the right time, but something else.
Q: I understand.
A: And I — and I think it’s 1m-important to — to know and to acknowledge it, and to
thank God for — for this gift of life. And now, being grandfather, you know, and
having a ni — a young lady that, you know — where’s — where’s my painting?
Where’s my painting, grandchild’s pa-painting? Because you know, the — the
grandparents week this week. And my — show me — show yours, too. And — and we

A2: But this one is important.
Q: Yeah.
A: But you know, that’s — that’s important. The grandpa.

Q: Green beard. Well, thank you grandpa.
A: You’re welcome.
