A: Actually no Hebrew school. Actually what was done in Vienna was several times a week or
maybe it may have been only once a week, the various kids, children in the class would go to
their religious class. And so I would go to the religious education with the Jewish children and so

forth. And at home, my father saw to it that we learned a lot, through ritual and later on we had
private lessons. But that was in this country.

A: To the age of ten or so, yeah
Q: What about your extended family, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins?
A: My grandparents lived in Poland which was 24 hours by train from Vienna. So I saw them
once. We went there once. My mother took us to meet them once. That’s all. I had no real
contact with them because that was a tremendous distance.
Q: No aunts, uncles, cousins in —
A: No, my father was the only one that came to Vienna. They had lots of friends and people
came to visit us.
Q: Were your parents Zionists at that time?
A: My father was quite Zionistically inclined in his youth, from what I understand. He once
decided he was going to walk to the ocean and go to Israel but we were not you know I mean,
not that I’m — not in my, let’s say I wasn’t that much aware of. I knew there was a Palestine and I
was for it. But we weren’t very much involved in the organization.
Q: You had Jewish and non-Jewish friends you said.

A: Definitely.
Q: When did you start hearing about a man named Hitler? Do you remember your first time that
you heard about him?
A: I, it was a sequence of various political upheavals in Austria. I don’t remember the details too
much, but I remember someone being president called Dollfuss and then somebody being shot
and then somebody by the name of Schuschnigg and then — but I do remember that in March
1938, I think it was the —
Q: The Anschluss.
A: The Anschluss of the — but I had the flu and I was home. And so when I returned to school a
week later, everything had changed.
Q: In what sense?
A: Well children, we were seated in the back of the room. We were treated totally differently.
Q: These are the Jewish students.
A: Yes, yes, yes the Jewish children. Moved to the back of the room and everything was outside
was unsafe on the streets and otherwise. But I may have heard of — I mean the over, the night that
Hitler marched into Vienna of course, and my mother got sick and knew right away and my
father was you know, they knew immediately that we had to get out. But I wasn’t totally aware
of it until I got back to school. And eventually we were told that our school would have to close
and that a different system was going to be taking over.
Q: What were your feelings in the beginning when you first came back to school and you had to
stay in the back of the classroom?

A: I didn’t understand.
Q: Were you frightened? Do you remember being frightened?
A: I just totally amazed. And I didn’t quite understand it.
Q: Because up to that point you had not experienced any anti-Semitism.
A: Not there. I had many friends that were not Jewish.
Q: And you would go to their house and play and they would come to your house.
A: Yes, yes. Yes. We played more in the park than in the houses. It wasn’t as many dates as
there are in this country.
Q: There you are in the back of the classroom with these other Jewish girls. Did you talk among
yourselves about what was happening?
A: Oh I’m sure not. I’m sure we were frightened now that you get to it. I’m afraid we didn’t
have to talk because immediately we realized that 1t was dangerous to walk in the streets. That —
Q: How did you know this? You’re 12 years old right?
A: Yeah. So when we went back from school or going to school, or going back from school there
were hordes of other kids attacking us and —
Q: Physically attacking?
A: Yes, I mean my sister who was four years younger, they spat in her face and pulled her by the
pigtails and then there were big signs on the benches saying no Jews allowed and we were not
allowed in the parks overnight. So this all happened really very quickly.

January 23, 2014 9
Q: And what is the reaction of a 12 year old child to this? Is it something you talked about with
your parents?
A: Oh, we talked about it but we just existed from day to day and watched what was going on.
Our maid was leaving. She wasn’t allowed to work for Jews anymore. And we got somebody
who had already been a refugee from some other part of Austria.
Q: This was a relative who came to your house you mean?
A: No this was a poor soul who had a sister and a father and they were, they came from
Klagenfurt which is the provinces and they had been chased out the very day that Hitler arrived.
And all she could do to get food on the table was do domestic work so she came to us. And a
very sad soul whom I remember to this day. And then my father —
Q: How did she know you all?
A: Oh she didn’t know us. My mother somehow -- recommendations. I don’t know, somebody
recommended a needy case. My mother was always ready for needy cases. And my father —
Q: Before the Anschluss, before 38, had you heard of a man named Hitler, because he got into
power in 33 and I was just wondering?
A: I probably, I had heard of it but it didn’t affect me. I mean it didn’t hit home.
Q: Had you ever heard him speak over the radio before 38 any of his speech —
A: I remember sitting in the living room with my parents, listening to the radio but I didn’t take it
seriously. I was 11.
Q: I was going to say, you were a child.

Interview with Alize Barzilay
January 23, 2014 10
A: I was 11 and, when they marched in and I was even younger before. When it began.
Q: So that’s when the big change happened at the Anschluss. Did you see Hitler at that time?
A: I never saw him.
Q: You never saw him.
A: No but I saw the guy you know the SS and I saw them marching in front of my windows and
screaming and you know that was immediate. The night that he marched in, we still had the
gentile woman working for us and my parents happened to be at the theater that night and
weren’t home. And it was very frightening, hordes and hordes of people marching in front of the
windows. And you know my sister was even younger. She was seven so.
Q: How did your nursemaid, governess, handle that?
A: That was actually the maid and that wasn’t our governess and she didn’t handle it all that
well. And when my parents came home, they found that the gas was on. So she didn’t stay with
us much longer. But it could have, if they hadn’t come home when they did, god knows what
would have happened.
Q: Right. What was it like to see these soldiers marching and hear the sound of the boots and
things like that?
A: That was frightening.
Q: What about, did the swastika have any meaning to you? At that time?
A: It conveyed a lot of enthusiasm of the masses from which I was excluded. That’s what you

know, it didn’t quite hit me just what they were doing. Yeah, that they were going to kill my
grandparents and everybody else.
Q: The Anschluss happens and then and you go to school and you have to stay in the back of the
room and then what was the next development?
A: The next development was we were told that we, in my school that, 1t was a gymnasium, an
academic gymnasium, that we could not continue there. That the school was closed down. And
that only the top students in the city would be allowed to enroll in the one Jewish gymnasium
that existed.
Q: But the gymnasium you were in was not a Jewish —
A: No, but women’s, you know not institution but a women’s school. So they had to qualify for
that other gymnasium with grades and so forth and I did qualify and I was accepted to it so I was
happy that I could continue my academic education. And my sister was younger so she —
Q: She was in the earlier school?
A: Yeah and that could continue til fourth grade. So there was no issue. I went to that school in
September in 1938 but it really didn’t have the greatest effect on my life, except that I felt good
about being there because we left you know several months later. You know four months later.
Q: With your relationship with your parents, did they talk over as things were —
A: They were very supportive all the way whether here or in Cuba or anywhere else. It was
fantastic when I think about it.
Q: But I meant when you were younger, before you left Austria, were they open with you in
discussing what was happening?

January 23, 2014 12
A: They didn’t hide it. I didn’t feel that they hid anything, were hiding that. It couldn’t be
hidden. It couldn’t. They were open I think. Maybe not completely. I mean we were children. I
just can’t gauge that.
Q: But you weren’t allowed to go out on the street then?
A: By myself, anyway. And we were, you know I was afraid to be. And going away in the
summer and for instance on the ski trip that, with the school that was just the week before March
in where you could, there you could feel the Nazism in the mountains. It was
completely so.
Q: How did you feel that, in what sense?
A: You just felt it, that we were surrounded by enemies. And the amazing thing is we were on
the slopes and it was a second year gymnasium which is the sixth grade class. Skiing and on the
slope with us was the Duke of Windsor who had just abdicated I think or something. He was in
the process of marrying her, the Duchess of Windsor. But anyway, we felt it there. I mean
totally because we stayed at the type of place that you know in the mountains where there were
no Jews. It was obvious that it was their town.
Q: You yourself didn’t experience any direct anti-Semitic —
A: Well it was coming pretty soon. I mean my father’s business.
Q: What happened with that?
A: That, a commissar was put in which meant that he oversaw the whole business and eventually
it was taken over and he had a lot of good friends among the gentiles who suddenly became big
shots in the Nazi party. But so I think that he was somewhat — he was somewhat in better shape
by some unseen protection you know. But so that, the business was going and what else. How
did —

Q: Do you know if they had any, if your father or mother had any relation or communication
with their families in the other, you know far away?
A: Well that, they immediately tried to get us out. I mean they knew we had to leave. So —
Q: To go into the countryside you mean?
A: No, no, to go abroad. Is that what you’re asking?
Q: No I was asking, your relatives you said were not in Vienna.
A: No, they offered to take us into Poland. My father didn’t think that was a good move.
Q: Right. Ok.
A: So we didn’t move. He wrote to relatives in other countries.
Q: So that’s when he started to write to —
A: Yes, immediately. So they wrote to Palestine and to the United States and I had some cousins
in Palestine and his brother and the cousin didn’t answer and my sister years later said it’s a good
thing. But anyway so didn’t answer. I had cousins in New York who did answer.
Q: Who did answer.
A: Did answer and who you know gave us an affidavit and helped us elaborate the roads through
Cuba and all that.
Q: At that point, what did America mean to you, as a 12 year old?

A: An unknown promised land.
Q: But something very positive?
A: Yes, yes. I had met actually those relatives were on their honeymoon in Vienna a couple of
years before and other people too and whom, you know it sounded like an unknown wonderful
place.
Q: Your father got papers, got the affidavits from the New York —
A: From the family in New York, in New York. And then there was another issue that, you know
the Kristallnacht. You know that. So do you want the sequence was that they came to our house
and they went from door to door and took out all the men from the whole building. You know
and they came to our door. They read the name. The name is Schachter and somebody gave the
order, skip that door.
Q: Oh?
A: So they skipped our door and went on and we could hear the screams in the streets and could
hear the glass breaking and everything else but we were saved for the night.
Q: Do you know how that happened?
A: No, I never found out but we were sitting in the ante room, the large ante room, actually
waiting to be invaded and my father said would you like me to go out so that we get it then over
with. And so we said no. And that’s when they skipped us and, but we could hear everything and
I’ve never forgotten it. In the streets and then after Kristallnacht when the others were
transported you know to god knows what destinations. My father was contacted by some Aryan
friend of his or formerly friends and now Aryan. But they were still friendly and was told that
he had to leave the country by December 31“', 38. Otherwise that nobody could vouch for
anything. That wasn’t likely to leave.

Interview with Alize Barzilay

Anyway so they intensified their efforts to get the exit possibilities and the, so America was so, I
mean the United States was the possibility. But we also needed a document called an
unbedankleischtide [ph] to get out of the country which had to be gotten from the Nazis and
which wasn’t available so quickly. We might not have it by December 31“. So we decided, my
parents decided to split the family up. And so that my father and my little sister who was
adorable would go on New Year’s Eve and try and cross the border because the guards would be
drunk. They thought.
And we would stay and wait for the paper and then see if we could exit properly and perhaps
ship some of our stuff overseas and so await us later on.
At any rate they did proceed accordingly. In the meanwhile the people from -- the cousins
helped us get a visa into Cuba, which was obtainable at that point by depositing $500 per person
as a guarantee in Cuba and sending us tickets to go to Cuba. And —
Q: This was your American cousin who told you.
A: Yes.
Q: What were their names?
A: Their name was Max and Ida Rothschild. They lived in Great Neck. And so they, it was my
father’s first cousin. Anyway they, where was I. They arranged for the Cuba. So my sister and
my father got through. They were drunk and they went, it’s really amazing, to Switzerland and
then went on to England, very soon after, with the idea that we would join them in England,
where we had very good friends.
Q: How did he stay in contact with your mother?
A: Well we didn’t -- I mean there wasn’t much time involved. And we left two weeks later. It
so happened.
Q: No, once he left your house and got over, do you know how he stayed in contact with —

A: I don’t know. I don’t know. But, when they got to England they called us for sure. I don’t
know. I just don’t know. Anyway we stayed behind and we did not have the paper. I can imagine
how my mother felt when they said goodbye to each other. At any rate, eventually the paper
came and they packed the list van you know with our belongings with the SS watching every bit
of the way what we’re taking, what we’re not. And my mother was very smart and she’d give
some away and you know she’d bribe them and all the way. So we got some things together.
And they were shipped to the United States to await our eventual arrival.
Q: What did you mother take with her?
A: With her to the —
Q: Or sent on?
A: Sent on. We had furniture and everything, everything. Rooms full of belong -- you know
Q: She was able to ship all that over?
A: Yes, yes. Yes, part of it, yes. So the first apartment that we had in, which was Washington
Heights here was furnished with our furniture.
Q: What did you take as a child, what did you take with you?
A: What I shipped was all my books and they were children’s. It was ridiculous.
Q: Your books.
A: Some of them, no value to me. In the end, I gave it to, you know when you give -- I love my
books. I didn’t want to give them up.

Q: Right. Did you take any personal, besides books, anything very personal, any —
A: I’m sure we —
Q: Dolls or things like that?
A: I’m sure I did but I don’t recall too much. We went with minimal luggage to England.
Q: Let’s back up for a minute. How did you feel about leaving Austria? Did you feel very
Austrian?
A: I felt this was home until that March. I felt this was it, that’s how I was --
Q: You were Austrian.
A: But Jewish, always knew they were Jewish.
Q: Now you have to leave. What’s that like for a child?
A: It’s stress. Will I have new shoes when I need them. When my feet grow. All sorts of things
and we won’t have money. We knew that you know.
Q: Did you tell your friends you were leaving?
A: Everybody’s leaving. Everybody’s leaving.
Q: Was it something you talked over with your friends?
A: We talked about it I’m sure but they, many of my friends had already left and others were --
made new friends because I was in a new school. So there wasn’t a continuous friendship
possible.

Q: I also meant to ask you with Kristallnacht, did you seen any damage, any building damage?
A: Oh we saw a lot outside on the streets they demolished the showcases. Anybody, you know
the windows of stores. Everything and I heard screaming men in the back. We had talk and even
the back and in the front and you could hear them lugging the men away from their homes.
Q: Was your father’s place damaged? Business damaged?
A: Not terribly that I’m aware of. No, I think that the commissar must have had a high position —
I don’t know
Q: So now you’re leaving Vienna with your mother. And --
A: Joining them in England where they --
Q: How did you get there?
A: We took, from Vienna to a train and the Channel. I think the train went over, all the way to — I
can’t remember whether it was --. To, via Holland and I think then a ship to England, then on to
London. I’m not quite sure.
Q: Did you know any English at that point?
A: Well yes, because when Hitler came to Vienna, the French governess left. She went, she
disappeared almost immediately. And my mother decided to hire somebody else because she
was working part time with my father. It was a large business. And the one she decided to hire
this English speaking. She thought it was better for the children. And it was. Yes, I knew some
English.
Q: You knew some English?

A: Not perfectly but I knew, yes.
Q: Now you’re landing, you’re in London.
A: Yes and we went to school. We went to a public school for about two months and then we
left.
Q: What was it like living in London and what were your memories of that? What are your
memories of that?
A: It was positive. But we were living with an elderly lady in her 80s in her home. And there
was but nothing permanent about it. Just she was, they were friends with both the sons and her
and they were very willing to keep us but it wasn’t, and the people were very nice and --
Q: These were people your parents knew?
A: They knew from Vienna.
Q: They knew from Vienna yeah. And so did you go to school or did you stay —
A: I went to school for the two months. I didn’t know how long we were staying because they
were trying to convince us to stay. And my father said no, we’ve got to get out of here.
Q: And what were the British children, girls’ reaction to your, or boys and girls reaction to you?
A: They were all right. They sort of ridiculed the English a little bit, but that’s ok. There
wasn’t enough time to form great relationships in two months.
Q: Then the next step 1s what?

A: The next step we sailed on March 9" 1939 ona -- from Liverpool to Havana. We went from
London by plane actually which was a whole new experience, because my father wanted the
children to experience an airplane. And it was a very bad flight but at any rate we did experience
the airplane. And then we took the boat and it was a 17 day trip to Havana.
Q: Do you know the name of the boat?
A: Yes, yes, it’s Oropesa, O-R-O-P-E-S-A.
Q: On what line?
A: Pacific. I don’t know. I did know but --
Q: Again, what were your thoughts about leaving Europe? Here you’re going —
A: At that point one was in motion for the best, getting to the best possible destination. It was --
you will hear . When we got to Cuba. I mean it was an interesting crossing and there were others
going to different parts of Latin America, different ports. And similar families. Similar
situations and when we landed in Havana, we, men came up to inspect the, the boats and the
papers and everything and then transported us into small boats in the harbor. And told us all to
go into small boats. And we went into these boats and we thought we were going into Havana.
But we weren’t. They shipped us to a small island off the coast. And where they had an
orphanage for Cuban children and they separated the men and the women. And they wanted us
to buy our way out.
Q: So were you with your mother at that —
A: I was, well we slept with my mother and my father was in the other, they were bunk beds,
double deckers and we weren’t the only ones taken off the boat. There were other people landing
there. And so we stayed there and none of the people that were there had money really to buy

their way out. But the Joint Distribution Committee in Havana did this, helped and we eventually
got out. And we went into Havana harbor and you know a number of days later and —
Q: You said there were many refugee families and children. Did the children stick together? Did
you —
A: Yes, we made friends on board ship and sort of, after 17 days you do under those conditions.
It was all a nice pleasant experience.
Q: Did you, as kids, did you talk about Hitler? Did you talk about Germany? Did you talk about
those kind of things?
A: I’m not sure, I’m not sure. I can’t be sure. Probably did but I don’t know.
Q: Now you’re in Havana.
A: In Havana we went, the first step was a hotel. And called the Moraya, in the Calle Moraya
in the street. And they, each family got moved into one room. The four of us and —
Q: How old were your parents at this point?
A: My mother was 33 and, she was 33 and my — she was young. And my father was I guess 44 or
something like that. She was 32 or 33. My mother was born in 05 and my father in 94 so but
they were young. She was particularly young.
Q: Was she a strong woman? Was she —
A: She was a terrific woman and loved by everybody whether they spoke her language or not.
She was absolutely wonderful in relating to people.

A: Terrific, terrific, terrific, absolutely terrific. And my father was able, in his too,
very business-like, not as broad a horizon but my mother was absolutely an unbelievable woman.
And my father, I mean he made all the right decisions so they were both terrific in their way. I
don’t — so that’s you know otherwise we wouldn’t be here I don’t think.
Q: Did any of your extended family who were far out from Vienna get out when you did?
A: Just one sister of my mother’s eventually many years later. And her husband was actually at
the World’s Fair buying machinery when the war broke out in Poland. They were living in
Poland and couldn’t get back and so it’s a whole story in itself. So that one came to this country
and that sister only just died at age of 104. And her husband the same 103, 104. Yeah. Others,
none of them got out.
Q: None of them got out. To get back to Havana.
A: Yeah we’re in Havana and we were in this one room arrangement which has semi walls like
cab --like in offices where --
Q: Half way up?
A: That’s correct with family next to each other. Anyway we got to know some families and
three families moved together to a lovely section in the suburbs, living they cost that way so we
each family got two bedrooms. So, it was a beautiful house and a huge kitchen which was
shared. And with a coal stove. My mother had to light the stove. A big change from what she
was brought up to do. But she was terrific. And washed the marble floors and everything. And
my father went into town and tried to establish relations with the textile trade. I don’t know how
because he didn’t speak Spanish. And the first day that he went to town he was robbed of his
good watch, a gold watch which was inherited from his father. But at any rate, he managed. He
did establish friendships and relationships and imported textiles for the trade there. I don’t know
how he managed, I mean really I don’t know. And they arranged for us, they didn’t like the

schools, the public schools were impossible. And so they arranged for us to go to private school.
And they found a very good private school which without money in my, they called it the
English School at the time. And my father used to pay it with fabrics, you know and this woman,
a missus, she took us in and we were very fortunate. So we went to school with all upper class
Latin children.
Q: And now you were learning the language?
A: Yes, I did —
Q: Did you pick it up easily?
A: Very easily. I had Latin in Vienna and I had French in Vienna and I spoke German and I had
Hebrew lessons. Languages are not my problem.
Q: Were you with a lot of other Jewish children?
A: No, no there were not in the school no, but out in the community, yes. A lot of transit refugees
waiting for visas.
Q: What did you know at that point that was happening?
A: Well I knew that for instance we came in March and in June the, another boat came and with
refugees called the St. Louis and I saw it in the harbor and I saw yes, yes. We used to go down to
the harbor and watch it every day and then one day we went and it left so —
Q: What were your thoughts?
A: That was very stressful.
Q: Did you see the people on the railing and things like that?

A: But in a distance. You know it wasn’t that close. We could see forms but not you know. It
was really bad.
Q: Again did you talk this over with your parents?
A: Oh I’m sure my parents took us down to see it. And —
Q: Were they noticeably affected cause they obviously knew what was happening?
A: Well there’s nothing you can do. You know, I’m sure they were affected. I can’t judge that
this late in the game.
Q: How was your younger sister doing? She was how much younger at this point.
A: She was ok, she was ok. She was an exceedingly able person and she was doing ok, all —
Q: Even as a young child?
A: Yeah, well yeah, it wasn’t as obvious as later, but she certainly did exceedingly well.
Q: Life just continued on. You were going to school.
A: My sister she was always a leader. I mean like president of the high school, at Hunter
College high school and all that type of thing. So this was, she was always —
Q: The seeds were there when she was younger.
A: Yes, definitely, maybe this instigated it. You know she says, it said so on her obituary in the

Q: Did you do anything besides go to school? What else did you do in Cuba, in Havana?
A: The community was many factions of Judaism so it was funny. There was a large contingent
from Frankfurt so they had services in each other’s homes. I mean that wasn’t the children. It’s
not, you’re asking me the children or the community?
Q: Both, both.
A: Ok, so they were you know different people. Some were religious and some were not. Of the
three families where we lived, the ones came from, they had lived in Italy, the one family. They
had two teenage boys and they second family had — were Germans and were totally un, were not
educated and didn’t have the same vision of wanting the kids to be that well educated either. So
there, you know you got used to various types of people. And what else did we do? The school
day was long enough and the community was friendly. So but we mixed mostly with our own.
Yeah. My father mixed with the trades. And we stayed friends with those Cubans for years later.
Q: Any communication with the people back in Europe?
A: A letter, a card came once from my mother’s parents and that was it. That was it. Yeah, and I
know she lost her grandfather who with us. Anyway, they all perished, except for this one sister
who lived underground in Poland whose husband was here and who eventually got out but and
then moved in with, back to and moved to Lakewood, New Jersey.
Q: So life just went on in Cuba.
A: Yes, and we waited for the visa. Some people went sooner, some went later. It depended on
where your parents were born and some people had nervous breakdowns in the process. I
remember several.
Q: Really?

A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Q: That must have been very frightening to a young —
A: Yeah, I do remember the mother of one child had, went berserk and never was allowed into
the country in the end. Had to stay in Cuba. And the father and the child went. That’s really,
you know it’s very terrible. Yeah.
Q: So then you stayed there, in Cuba for how long?
A: 18 months.
Q: 18 months. And I’m sure you were very fluent by that time.
A: I was. I eventually worked in, using my Spanish.
Q: And then the papers came through.
A: Yes, yes and we came and we went I’m just trying to say how that went. From Havana to
Key West by boat and from Key West to New York by Greyhound bus.
Q: How did you feel leaving Cuba?
A: I wanted to go on. I liked it you know but it was time to go. It wasn’t a permanent thing.
Q: And so you left. What month did you leave? Do you remember?
A: September 1940.

and I kept a diary. I have a diary.
Q: You did?
A: In school, yes, in school. They made me keep it. Robert and — nice diary. I’m glad I have it
for the grandchildren.
Q: What, do you remember some of the things you wrote in the diary generally?
A: Well the diary is actually strictly political because it was an assignment. But you know they
progressed from the Maginot line to this or that. That type of thing.
Q: So the description was like —
A: Descriptions with some maps from the newspapers.
Q: Oh I see. It wasn’t your thoughts or your —
A: No, no, no. But my thoughts, I did what I could and wrote something for the children down to
my grandchildren.
Q: You mean later on. But at the time, war has what kind of meaning to a young teenager?
A: Terrible. At the time, you mean in Havana. I don’t, I didn’t feel that, I mean it’s not, it’s
frightening. That’s all I could say. You know but —

Q: And how did your parents get the news — from the radio, from newspapers?
A: Yes. Yes, radios and newspapers and discussions. There was, there were multiple people
living there and meeting, you know getting together and following it very eagerly and hoped for
the best. You know, you can’t get frightened every day. You live from day to day. As a child.
So just hoping for the best, that the right people would win.
Q: Your health was good and your parents’ health?
A: Yes, knock wood.
Q: And you had enough food?
A: Yes, never felt deprived even though god knows we didn’t have much money. Never felt it.

A: Well no only to get the bus.
Q: Right, and then you got on the bus
A: Yeah, and got to New York.
Q: Got to New York. And again your thoughts or were you just exhausted.

A: Yes, precisely. Yes.
Q: Wonderful. Were you met by your relatives when you arrived?
A: By an elderly aunt who actually, she and her husband, they were the parents of the
Rothschilds. Mrs. Rothschild, Ida Rothschild and she wanted us to stay with her which she was,
actually had a grocery store and a small apartment in Brooklyn and I don’t know if she thought
my mother was going to work in the grocery store. We stayed very briefly and my brother in law,
the one that had come from Poland and for the World’s Fair to buy some machinery, had by then
lived in Lakewood and purchased a farm. And so we had, they thought that the most intelligent
thing in the way of moving was my mother and the two children would go to Lakewood and my
father would try to establish himself in New York and make connections during the week and
come just on the weekend. Anyway we moved, the whole furniture, everything to Lakewood and
we stayed there and about five days after we arrived, we had an episode at night where
somebody was climbing up the ladder and my brother in law took a shotgun. They used to — and
looked out the window and it was my father. He didn’t shoot, who had come to say that the
family had to stay together. No matter what. This is no good. So and that’s a good thing
because my brother in law was ultra-orthodox so it would have turned out much different. To
live with. In general too. I mean this is a very orthodox community in Lakewood. Anyway, my
father got us. No, my father and mother went to New York and got an apartment in Washington
Heights and we moved to Washington Heights. And I’ve been in New York ever since. And that
was you know with the whole furniture and everything.
Q: Right so you had all the Viennese furniture.
A: It was, not all of it but a good part yeah.
Q: Now you’re a teenager and you’re in Washington Heights and your English is good?
A: Yeah, good enough. I was valedictorian of the graduating class. That’s junior high school.

A: I don’t think so. No that wasn’t an option. I mean it was sort of -- that’s over. That’s was

Q: Was your mother very protective of you girls?
A: No, she was always encouraging us to be —
Q: To be independent you mean?
A: Independent and yeah, yeah.
Q: So then you started high school?
A: Yes, I went to Hunter College High School which is one that you have to qualify for and test
and so forth. And rather competitive school. And —
Q: What was the reaction of the other girls there at the school? Did they ask you about your
background?
A: No, I mean — there were others also like it but at that time you know, it wasn’t that relevant I
think. I mean it was relevant but I guess I just didn’t make the cut of the ___ side or whatever,
just a question of performance. I don’t think so. I mean I don’t —
Q: They didn’t ask you what your experience was. That’s what I mean. Did they ask you about
your experiences were in Europe, in Vienna?

about it that much.
Q: What about the teachers? Did the teachers ask you anything about —
A: Not that I recall. Not that I recall, just a question of achieving there. And I had lost a year in
that — by the system in Cuba so that I was eager to accelerate which is what I did and I only
stayed at the high school for two years and then graduated. So I didn’t really take full advantage
of it because I think you need the full three years or so. Anyway so.

A: Oh definitely yeah.
Q: What about your sister?
A: Everybody. Traveled by himself on the double decker bus.
Q: What about your younger sister?

Q: What was your father’s business when he came to the United States?

Steinham and company and but he was the kind that wanted to be independent. And so he didn’t

continue there but wanted to open his own office. And then did his own selling here too in the
fabric market and textiles and so forth. Not, I mean he always, he was super careful about not
making too much money with customers. He didn’t want to charge too much. And he didn’t
make a fortune but he managed and it was you know all right.
Both of us went to college. My sister went to Barnard, then to Oxford and the Sorbonne and then
she went out to Africa, specialty was African affairs. So far from the orthodox beginnings.

A: I didn’t have people in the camps so —
Q: No, I know but just when it came out generally what was happening.

didn’t live in the same country as I did and —
Q: So you’re working for that Israeli mission.
A: Yes.

A: No, no, no. I feel American.
Q: What are your thoughts about Austria and Germany now in today’s world?
A: I don’t quite trust it. 1 mean you know I’Il always like a Viennese waltz. We were there
briefly about 10, 15 years ago and I remember sitting in a restaurant where there were, had big
tables and we sat because everybody ate jointly in a pub of some sort. And they were talking
German and then they were talking to us. And I answered in German and they asked me how
come I knew German and I said I was born here and after that nobody talked to me. So yeah. So
they figured it out.
Q: Do you mind speaking German?
A: No, I don’t speak it well but I, I don’t speak it. I have no need, no need for it at all. That was
the only time I had need for it.
Q: But do you have any negative feelings towards speaking German?
A: Ihadn’t, I haven’t done it. I wouldn’t do it. I mean I just — if I had the need then I would
communicate because that’s the thing to do but you know I have had not many more positive
experiences with the Spanish speaking —
Q: When your children were your age and when you had to leave Vienna at the time of your age,
during Kristallnacht and all that. Did that bring back memories for you about frightening sounds
and sights that you saw then? Did you connect your children’s age to that time?
A: At my children’s age, I sort of marked it, I think. I didn’t think about it too much, didn’t
think about it too much. I mean I do occasionally think about it. One of my granddaughters for
instance is now the age that I was exactly and I think how it was different it is what she’s into
living, you know. Television you know it’s just fantastic. It’s different.

Q: When they were growing up?
A: Somewhat, but not tremendously. More so now that I’m older.
Q: Because’?
A: I don’t know. It’s somewhat removed, different. And also because I’m the only one surviving

Q: In your relationship with your sister of course, you both went through the same thing, though
you were at a different stage in life. Was that something you two girls spoke about a lot, about
life in Vienna or —
A: I did not. I did not that much. She talked about it more I think.
Q: She did? How did it affect her? She was younger, four years younger.
A: I don’t know how it affected her but she devoted herself to helping the hungry and she did a
lot for the — she actually, it affected her. That’s what, she had a big write up in the Times and it
affected. What she did in life.

Q: In what —
A: Well she was in, you don’t really want me to take out the -- should I take it out and read it to
you.
Q: No, but just generally.
A: Generally well she worked for the United Nations, one of the committees. She worked in the
World Bank. She worked at the hunger in Mexico, she devoted a lot of time to that. And various
other things of that nature and Africa particularly. Her interest in Africa was her specialty and
just everywhere. And that, I would say to a great extent so she individually, as a family they also
do things. That’s a different story.
Q: When she was alive, did you speak to her in English?
A: Oh yes. We spoke English from the day we came here and didn’t speak anything else. Even
the parents, never spoke German yes.
Q: Because?
A: I don’t know. We just did. They wanted it and they, we did it. That’s enough.

A: By speaking it, I guess. I don’t know why people don’t do it now.
Q: Do you think that you lost a part of your childhood because you were exposed to such
terrible times in Vienna? Did you grow up more quickly? Did something change?
A: I’m sure it had an effect but 1t would take some professional to determine that. I can’t judge.
But I feel I had a good youth and I was lucky to maintain my parents and I was lucky to be able
to do what I — and I have terrific grandchildren and you know and children so yeah.
Q: Are you angry that you had to be uprooted and leave your home and —
A: No. I mean I was angry at the events that took place but I, it’s just part of life. No, I can’t say
that.
Q: Well that you had to do that and other people who lived here in the United States didn’t have
to, you know.
A: A lot of people have to do it in various generations. I don’t give it too much thought. At this
point it’s even interesting to be born elsewhere. At that time people thought you were a refugee
but at this point I don’t feel that way. Yeah, I mean it’s added an extra dimension to my life.
Q: Ok.
A: Imean you know it wasn’t easy for my parents, particularly, but I don’t think it’s, the effect is
all negative. Many experience it.
Q: What about your political views? Did it affect your political views or influence your political
views at all?

Q: Were you active in the civil rights movement here in the United States in the 50s?
A: No. No. I think I was afraid of joining things to a great extent in my youth. Now that I’m
thinking about it. I wouldn’t have joined — I remember being in college and people being in the
Communist party and this, so or all sorts of things were going on then. And I wouldn’t have
joined anything after I saw the mass eruptions all over the place. I think I was not that eager to
join. And I think that persists.
Q: Cause it had a negative connotation.
A: I guess it must have, yes, yes. Marching en masse and all that business.

know it wasn’t settled that early in the —
Q: Right.
A: But no major reparations, no nothing. We have nothing
Q: In what way are you who you are today because of what you went through as a young girl?

Interview with Alize Barzilay
January 23, 2014 43
Q: In what sense? It made you what?
A: I, it’s difficult for me to judge but it’s made me more a citizen of the world I think and I feel
at home and I love traveling. I, we can’t do it now but, and I think perhaps it’s made me more
accessible to different kinds of people and vice versa. But I really totally feel American.
Q: You are comfortable around people from other countries?
A: Very, very. I enjoyed it and the citizens are everywhere. And I relate well to people from
many countries.
Q: You are fluent in so many languages.
A: A few languages and that helps.
Q: So you do feel that lessons have been learned from the Holocaust or —
A: What type of lesson, what?
Q: Well was that what happened as you said you think it could happen again but —
A: It might happen again. I don’t know that lessons are learned. It’s a new generation. It has no
hatred. Different ones but it needn’t always be directed at us. But it’s terrible. And it’s more
dangerous now than ever.
Q: Did you raise your children very Jewishly?
A: Not very, no not very. Very, reform and but they should know who they are and where they
come from. And I’m part of that and that they’re aware of and very much so.

Interview with Alize Barzilay
January 23, 2014 44
Q: Is there anything else you wanted to talk about or any message you wanted to leave to your
grandchildren? Anything that we haven’t covered?
A: I think that we’ve covered. I love my grandchildren and they’re interested in their roots as
well and they’re very interested. In their fashion.
Q: In how, in what sense?
A: Well I mean not an orthodox upbringing, that they wanted to be bar mitzvah and the parents
left it totally up to them. And they’re very warm and receptive, great human beings and I have
two granddaughters, one at Harvard and one a graduate from Harvard and is now at Cambridge
in England and then I have three here. Three littler ones. And they’re from eight to 16 in school
in New York and all are very loving and caring human beings as I couldn’t have wished for
better. And they’re willing to do good and wanting to do good and that’s I feel is the
achievement of the long life that I’ve been fortunate to have.
Q: And do you feel that the part of that was the byproduct of what you went through and how
you imparted your message to your children?
A: I, it may be so. It probably is you know. And I don’t want to take total credit for that. I think
a lot of things enter it. Parents and so forth. But I think that did have an effect. It made them also
more receptive to people from other nations I think.
Q: Did your sister write down any of her experiences?
A: I don’t know if she wrote her experiences, but she wrote several books but I don’t know.
You’d have to ask her. He’s 97 and in Washington and I told you I think. He lives in Washington
and you know the name of the place. I talking about. On Military road. So I don’t think, I’m sure
she’s written something.
Q: It sounds like you two girls, you two sisters shared in some kind of very special terrible time.

Interview with Alize Barzilay
January 23, 2014 45
A: But we were fortunate because we could live with parents and the immediate family alive and
the ones that sacrificed I didn’t really know that well. You know it doesn’t affect you the same
way. You know you would have wanted to have grandparents and relatives but we didn’t’ really
know them. It’s not quite the —
Q: Your connections with, your relations in Israel?
A: We don’t have very close relations at this point. My sister’s children and my children are
very close. They’re very close yeah. Like siblings are, they are very close.
Q: That’s a nice note to end on unless there’s something that.
A: Thank you very much and I wish everyone, certainly my children and grandchildren all the
best and I want to think you for making this possible.
Q: Well thank you for doing that. Let me just close off by saying that this concludes the United
States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Alice Barzilay.
A: Thank you, thank you.
Q: You’re welcome.
