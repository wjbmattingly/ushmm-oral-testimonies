You were a girl so you were not circumcised, that\u2019s why. So the Germans were looking for circumcised boys to kill them, and they killed them right there at the spot. And luckily \u2014 I was wounded also, with one of the shots, and I still have \u2014 I have as \u2014 in my leg, a problem with that. Both legs, yeah."
