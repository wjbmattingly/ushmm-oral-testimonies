And the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape one, side A. Mr. Lessing, we\u2019re just going to go on and recap some of your experiences during the war, and if you want to just start talking about -- I di -- basically from the beginning of the German occ -- occupation in the Netherlands, when you went into hiding, and the [indecipherable] a short description of that time, and then we\u2019ll go into the post-war experiences.",
            "answer": "The -- Well, as you probably know, Holland was invaded in May 1940, when I lived with my father and my mother and my two brothers, who are eight and 10 years younger than I -- than -- than I am, in a little town called Delft, in Holland. And my father was all his life a musician, and had recently opened a little clothing store, to see if he could get away from the -- th -- wi -- away from the music. On the 10\" of May, two days after my 14\" birthday, the Germans suddenly -- I looked out the -- out the window, and there was all German planes and paratroopers in the sky. And five days later, we were, of course -- the Dutch government ran away, the queen ran away to London, and we were an occupied country. And it didn\u2019t worry us too much, because the -- the war was going to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  3 be over anyway very soon, we all knew that, and the Germans would never do in Holland what they had done in Germany, to the German Jews. But, pretty soon, of course, we began to find anti-Semitic ordinances in the -- in -- in the -- in the paper, and things progressed rapidly. Two years later, 1942, after I couldn\u2019t go to school any more, and we were all wearing yellow stars on our clothing, two years later, in October 23\", 1942, we went into hiding. We were actually all set to go on the trains to what the Germans euphemistically called work relief, in Germany. We were all set, we had our backpacks ready, but my grandfather, who happened to come over fo-for a visit from Amsterdam, warned us that -- warned my parents that we -- we might not at all be going to work in Germany, that the Germans were lying, that there were rumors going around, and although no one knew where -- where we were yes going, he said don\u2019t ever go. It seems to have made a deep impression upon my parents, because at some point, they decided we\u2019re not going to go on those trains, like most of the Jew -- Dutch Jews, and we were going to go into hiding, although we had no places prepared. So, as I said, on the 23 of October, 1942, we walked -- in the morning we walked out of our home, and never to return to that same house again. And that night my family spread around. My na -- They  My -- My parents went one way, and my brothers went another way, I didn\u2019t know where they went. And I was left, for awhile, in that -- with our friends where we had walked to, in the suburbs of Delft. I stayed there for a little while. And from there I went to -- first address in Utrecht, two old ladies who took me in, but very soon got scared, and Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  4 I had to go. My mother, who 1s -- really became the -- the hero of this -- of our hiding story -- of our wartime story in general, was the only one who traveled on trains, and she went around finding places for all of us. She fou -- She decided that -- She suggested that I would bleach my hair and pretend to be a Christian boy, and work as a stable boy, s - go find work on a sta -- as a stable boy on a Dutch farm. She then found a little farm somewhere, little farmer who had five cows, dairy farm, and that\u2019s where I went to work. That was my first farm, and it was absolute hell. I was this Jewish city kid, and I was supposed to go out at five o\u2019clock in the morning, in the pouring rain, and -- and milk cows, and so, and I did. I -- I learned all that. I walked with bleeding feet 1-1n -- in wooden shoes, and -- very -- well, I don\u2019t know how long I was there. My guess is -- My guess is maybe -- oh, maybe -- maybe a half a year, I -- I\u2019m not quite sure. The chronology is sometimes a little difficult to follow, but anyway, I -- I decided to give myself up to the Germans. I couldn\u2019t stand the -- the fear of being maybe discovered, and the loneliness. I was all by myself. I was 16 years old, and I decided that I couldn\u2019t stay in there, I would give myself up. I figured, sooner or later, the Germans are going to find me anyway, and -- but my mother again, it\u2019s always my mother in this story, who came to visit me sometimes, secretly, we would meet somewhere in the fields, talked me out of it, and said she would try and find another place for me. And she found, through a whole long story that I can\u2019t go into now, but she found a police officer called Oskam, was his last name, O-s-k-a-m, who ostensibly was a - was a Nazi Dutch police officer, came from Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  5 a completely Nazi family, and -- but -- but -- in -- in reality was a member of the underground, and was hiding about 30 Jewish men, women and children, in the little village not too far from Utrecht. And my mother had asked him if he would know a place for me, and I talked with him, and he said, \u201cI have a place for you, but it\u2019s very dangerous. You will not be able to leave there, and you will not be able to see any members of your family. Do you still want to go there?\u201d And I said, well -- I figured everything was better -- anything was better than being isolated by myself on a farm. And he -- when I said yes, I would like to go there, he took me to a -- a hut in the middle of the woods, where he left me with seven Dutch Resistance men, mostly -- they were mostly of the -- what shall I say? The m -- More intellectual class o-of Dutch people. They didn\u2019t look like what you would think of partisans, or anything, didn\u2019t wear machine guns, or an-anything like that, but they had built this hut. And I stayed there from -- my guess is August 1943, until -- the exact date is 29\" of December, 1943. I was the only Jew, I was the youngest, I was 16 - 17 then -- I was 17 years old then, and let\u2019s see, the men would go out at night and raid police stations, and -- and ci-city halls, and - and break in and get identity claus -- get identity cards, and -- and official German stamps, and -- and weapons. And so we were sort of a center, people would stop in, a-and take away weapons, and -- and -- and papers, and so on and so forth. I should go just - because it will relate to later on in this story, I should mention that one day two men were brought in, one who claimed to be a Canadian, and one who claimed to be an Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  6 Englishman, and claimed to have been on a raid in -- in the -- in the Royal Air Force, on a ra -- in on a raid to Germany, and were -- their bomber was shot down, and they bailed out, and they wound up in the -- and the Resistance got them before the Germans got them, and they brought them into our hut. So here were these two men, and I was assigned to interview them, because I spoke English well. I don\u2019t quite know why, but I think I have a hint of why. My parents had lived in the United States for three years, in29 to 1932. So I interviewed these men, and found out that they were not German spies, but they were a bona fide RAF people. They w -- They -- They spent awhile with us in the hut, but eventually they were smuggled out by the Resistance, through Belgium, through France, and Spain, and I guess Portugal, and -- and smuggled back to England. I don\u2019t know if they ever flew again, I will find that out in -- in August. There\u2019s a - There\u2019s a story connected with that. On the tr -- In December, towards the end of the -43, we got a message, somehow another, an intercepted message that the Germans had become suspicious of the -- of the area, the woods where we were. We were -- We were in the -- in the middle of a small parcel of woods. In Holland, you don\u2019t really have forests. These were planted parcels of woods, rectangles, one after another, about four or five, and they had the very dense undergrowth of evergreens. You couldn\u2019t walk through them, you would have to smash your way through -- through the undergrowth, however, we had a secret path to the hut. As I said, in December, the men in the hut got the message that the Germans had become suspicious, and we were -- they then decided we https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  7 should set out guards, and so a companion and I drew the lot for the 29\" of December, I think four to eight A.M. watch, standing right inside the periphery of the -- in the woods. Now, on the -- on the -- on the woods, in -- within the first line of trees, and that\u2019s where we saw the Germans coming, in the half dark, and it was, of course, traumatic, because I realized they had come to kill me. I was very tempted to run away, I didn\u2019t. The both of us ran back into the hut, warned the men. There was a total confusion there, cause they were sleeping in the bunkbeds, and we pulled the blankets off them, and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a raid, get up.\u201d And when -- when we saw that they were all out of the bunkbeds, we ran, and we ran to the edge of our parcel of wood -- of woods, and as I always say when I - when -- when -- when I looked to the left and to the right, it seemed to me the Germans were coming around the corners of the woods, and I feared that nobody that we had left behind, would survive. We then jumped across the dirt road, into the next parcel of woods, and crashed through, and we ran and ran and ran and ran, until we wound up in a city called Hilversum, which you probably have heard about, it\u2019s the center of Dutch radio -- radio transmitter. And I can\u2019t go into the details now, but somehow another, we wound up at night in the woods again, about five miles away from where the hut was, because that was the spot where we were supposed to reassemble in case of a raid. It had been previously agreed upon. And my buddy and I, my -- my partner and I waited there in the dark. We had guns, we had nine millimeter Mauser, and we had them at the ready, because we didn\u2019t know if the men would have been tortured to reveal the place that the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  8 Germans would -- might come and -- and ser -- I had pretty well decided then that -- that if they would come, that I would defend myself, I would -- I would try to kill, and be killed, probably, in a short gunfight. So, I was all prepared to die. It was very quiet, and then after awhile I did hear some noise coming through the woods, sounded like old metal rattling away, and thumping over -- wh-wheels on the dirt, and this bicycle rattled in the little clearing, and with a little flashlight somebody was shining ahead of it. And we didn\u2019t know who it was, we were ready to -- to -- to shoot. But nothing followed, and then we approached with drawn guns, and found out that it was not the Germans, and it was neither one of the men, it was my mother, who had heard about the raid, and had decided immediately to rescue us. Well, I think most of that escape, and so on, and my mother\u2019s part in that is probably in the -- in the video interview. We escaped. My buddy  My mother gave the old bicycle to my -- my friend, my -- my partner, and she gave him also the little flashlight, and he peddled away into the darkness, he said he knew a place where to hide. And my mother and I pretended to be lovers, and as we approached the German guard, we talked very loud, and we giggled, and we -- you know, with -- with terror in our hearts, but we put our arms around each other, and we made kissing sounds, and the -- and the German guard whom we approached seemed to want to stop us for a second, but he didn\u2019t, and we walked by him, and as I always say, to live another day in [indecipherable] of that circle of death. After that I was close to a nervous breakdown, I needed help. Two -- Two older people, two Dutch people who lived in a very nice Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  9 mansion, put me up in a room, very peaceful room overlooking a gorgeous garden, and there I s -- recuperated slowly, I stopped shaking, and I became very religious, I found a Bible, and for the first time read something about the Jewish history, and became devoted to it, and for the rest of the war, tried to be a religious Jew. When I felt strong enough again, I left that place, and I got myself a new pair of wooden shoes, and I went out and found a new farm, now in a better part of Holland. And in the more eastern part, where the farms are bigger, and the people are [indecipherable] and I started to work this time as a real farmhand. By then I seemed to have had enough experience to work with horses, and plow, and -- and of course I had bleached my hair again, and matter of fact, I had the chutzpah to go and register myself with my false identity card in -- in the town hall, to allay suspicion. It worked pretty well, I -- I wasn\u2019t -- I worked on a couple of farms. The farmers were happy with me. Of course, every second was always a challenge if anyone approached the farm. It was like, this is maybe it. In May, 1944, my mother, coming back on the train from visiting my brother Fred, my youngest brother who was sick, was -- she had managed to put in a hospital in the south of Holland. On the way back, she ran into a expert on the train, German -- a Gestapo expert on the train, zeesha hites a deest expert, probably, and he immediately recognized that she had a falsified identity card, and he arrested her. And she -- And he put her into a -- into a separate compartment in the train, where she was guarded by a Dutch policeman on the way to Amsterdam, and that she later tells him -- I\u2019m not quite sure any more at this point, by the way, let me interrupt https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  10 myself here for a second. I\u2019m not quite sure how much of this is in the videotape. I\u2019m not quite sure. I\u2019m quoting here things that my mother and my father said in interviews conducted -- audio interviews conducted by my brother Fred. My brother Fred conducted audio interviews with the whole family, my father, my mother, myself, my brother Ott, my cousins, my wife. I have a tray with audio interviews, with the voices of my parents and everyone, and he later also transcribed it in book form, together with his son. Now, all that, I think happened after the Holocaust Memorial Museum interview. So, I don\u2019t know, you can ask me later on it -- if it\u2019s not clear, I can go back to it. As my mother said- now I go back to what my mother as -- she was arrested, as my mother later on told in interview with my brother Fred, she ate all the paperwork that was in her -- in her handbag, so the -- so that there was -- sh -- and she swallowed it. So by the time that she got to the interrogation in Amsterdam, when they ask her what her real name was, she lied, and she said that her name was Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, which was her maiden name. She never mentioned her -- her married name. And since she didn\u2019t have any other papers, except her false identity card, they wrote it down, and as she said, a-as a -- out of the blue sky she added, \u201cAnd you have no right to keep me here, because I\u2019m an American citizen.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s in the -- in the video interview, either. In any case, she was sent to -- to Westerbork, Dutch camp, and from there she was sent to Bergen-Belsen, which we didn\u2019t know, of course. When I somehow heard that my mother had been arrested, I found my father and my two little brothers in a little cottage together, Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  11 in the -- not too far from Arnhem, in Holland, where -- that little cottage my mother had rented just before she was arrested, in order to be a -- a -- just a week together with her husband and her two little sons. And of course, for her this didn\u2019t work out, but my father had gone there, and my two little brothers were there, and I found them there, and I decided that rather than work on the farm, my father would need help to survive in hiding with my two little brothers. So I quit the farm, and bicycled over to this little cottage, and that\u2019s where we spent the last winter of the war. Together with my two brothers and my father, we begged, borrowed and stole whatever we could to survive, and thus we reached the spring of 1945, when we were liberated by the Canadian army, and where -- I really should say this part of your interview ends, because it was the end of the war. Many surprising things happened after that. If you want me to just go on with this now, or do you want to take a break\u2019?"

I can tell you this, I did not know Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  12 in the very beginning where my father and mother were, until the raid on the hut, when I spent one night after the raid, after my mother and I escaped out of that -- out of the woods there, I spent one night at their hi -- their hiding place, which was in Soest, in Holland. So then I knew where they were. My brothers, I never knew. But there was a little time, which I don\u2019t remember too clearly, when my brother Ott, my middle brother, s -- came to the farm where I worked, and this was my little brother who came from the city, and who needed to be fattened up a little bit, and -- of course, he was also in hiding, but -- and he spent some time with me on this farm, I don\u2019t know how long. From - From his interview later on, I -- I deducted he was there at least three weeks, or maybe even a month. I thought it was only a week. So, that period, I knew where my brother Ott was, he was with me. But then he disappeared again, and of course, from the fall of 1944, until the liberation 1945, my father, my two brothers and I were all together. Some of the communication was achieved through my grandfather\u2019s second wife. My grandfather lived in Amsterdam, my grandmother had died years before, he marred a non-Jewish woman, and had a daughter by her. And I| think that daughter, who was not Jewish, at least she was half Jewish, did not wear a star, and traveled, and I think she managed to send some messages around, and I think it must have been through her that I found where my father and my two little brothers were hiding in that little summer cottage. That\u2019s as best as I can tell you. Course we had no phones, we didn\u2019t write letters, was -- we couldn\u2019t.

            "answer": "The minute that we went underground, of course, we were isolated from the rest of the population of the world, you could say. But here and there, you would pick up an illegal piece of newspaper. You know, there were -- there were illegal newspapers that consisted usually out of two or four pages, badly printed, and sometimes you would find -- find one of those, or somebody would ha-hand you one of those. During my time in the Resistance hut, of course I found out more, because the men listened to the BBC, and we had a map there, and we charted the progress of the Russians and whatever else was happening. And we knew about the -- the bombardments in Germany and so on. So, at that time, I was pretty well aware of where the -- where the Germans stood, and where the Russians were, and where the English were, and the Americans, and so on, and so forth. But after the raid, when I went back to the farm, I was totally isolated. The farmers had -- they would talk about the war, but they -- they didn\u2019t know what was going on. What we could see were, of course, a thousand B17 bombers flying over almost every day, and by night we heard the English, a thousand planes going overnight. We knew there was enormous bombardments. And I had several interesting -- interesting happenings at one time. A liberator bomber came down right around the corner from the farm where I worked, and that was the time my brother Ott was there, it seems, because Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  14 he, in detail, describes how that plane came down, and how we ran there, and -- and how we found a little piece of -- of Plexiglas, little piece of -- from one of the -- one of the windows of the bomber, or the -- we -- we savored it like a piece of -- this was a piece of freedom. That was one. On another farm -- this must have been already in the summer of \"44, a Messerschmitt 109 was shot down, and crashed right into the ground, right near by the farm where I worked, there\u2019s -- there was another farm.

And I approached on bike, and I asked him if I could take a look, and he said, yeah, that\u2019s all right, and I actually walked around the God damn plane, and touched it, and [indecipherable] all fascinating. How did I get onto that? Oh, you asked me about what I knew about the war. During our ha -- last hiding, with my two brothers and my father, in the little summer cottage, we found out nearby, about a five minute walk through the fields, there was a big mansion type house, and in that house lived a whole collection of people, young and old. Later on, we found that several of them were in hiding themselves. But, they listened every day to the BBC radio. So, some might say the fall of 1944, until the liberation, we knew pretty well what was going on because of the evening -- in the evening we would go there, and we wouldn\u2019t https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  15 listen ourselves, but somebody would go up and listen in the attic, where they had a radio hidden, and they would tell us, \u201cThe Russians are right near Berlin,\u201d you know, \u201cand the- the invasion is going well.\u201d By this time, of course, the sixth of June, 1944, the allied invasion of France, we knew it was happening.

And then, through somehow another, they found this painter -- I have a painting of him [indecipherable] upstairs. I have several painting of my father, and also of his teacher. Found this teacher where he went once a week. I didn\u2019t want to go into the details about it, but I told you about the raid on the hut, and that my mother came to rescue us in the woods. The reason why she knew was, when my buddy and I ran off from the raid, we wound up in the city of Hilversum, I remember that my father took painting lessons from a man named Shlutter, a painter, well-known painter in- in -- in Holland. And that this man lived in a village near Hilversum, where we were, and I decided that -- we didn\u2019t know where the hell to go, that I would to this Shlutter, because obviously he was all right, he was somebody we could trust, because he gave my father painting lessons. It so happened when we -- we took a little train there, a little -- a little sht -- a little -- little -- a -- a s-- a tram, and it so happened when we got there, my father was there, painting, you know, very quiet in the studio of this man.

But one thing is for sure, my father eventually went back to his hiding place, and told my mother, and my mother immediately grasped the seriousness of the situation. My father didn\u2019t.

But his -- his glor-glory period came when we were all hiding in that little cottage, from the fall of 1944, until the liberation, 1945. He became a real strong father, you could almost say a brother to me. He and I took care of the boys, and ourselves. But he and I decided what -- how to find food, where to steal trees, you know. Where to beg for sandwiches from the farmers, or something, anything. It was like a team. When my father died, probably about 10 years ago, or so, I really felt like one of our team had died, you know? He shouldn\u2019t have died, we should have all died together, my two brothers, my father, and I, we were a team, a wonderful team of -- that managed to survive.

            "answer": "Very little. All right, the first thing I have to tell you about 1s -- its\u2019 a little bit difficult, the structure is a little bit different. I must first tell you about what happened to my mother, because it -- then I can go back to -- to us. My mother, as I said, was sent to Bergen-Belsen. And interestingly enough, she had a -- she had a dream -- my mother was always a little psychic, by the way, very interesting. There were times that she would say to my father, \u201cI think your father is maybe coming for a visit from Amsterdam today.\u201d And I don\u2019t know, three out of five times, there was my grandfather in the afternoon, you Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  24 know, ringing the doorbell. So we always thought she was, what we call in Dutch, helderzingda, clear -- clear voyant -- clairvoyant. She had a dream. I think -- I think it was in Westerbork, in the Dutch camp. She had a dream in which she saw a newspaper, a masthead of a newspaper, and that said, January 21, very big, and she woke up from it. And she thought, \u201cI wonder what that means, if it means something.\u201d And she thought, \u2018Either I will be dead by then, or I will be free.\u201d But then, how could she be free? I mean, she was in a concentration camp in Holland, and soon after that, she was sent to Bergen Belsen. And one day in January, a friend of hers, who she slept with in the same bunkbed, you know, the wooden bunkbeds they had there, said, \u201cYou know, Lene,\u201d she was always called Lene, from -- from Angeline, \u201cLene,\u201d she said, \u201cthere is an SS guy sitting in -- in the barracks, and he\u2019s checking on people who have foreign nationality.\u201d And my mother said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have foreign nationality.\u201d And her friend said, \u201cBut yeah, you said when you were interrogated in Amsterdam, you told him you don\u2019t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said my mother, \u2018so what? You know, I don\u2019t have any papers. I\u2019m not really an American.\u201d Okay, I got to go back, I got to b-backtrack, got to backtrack for a second to the interrogation in May44, when she was caught in Amsterdam, in front of the Gestapo there. [indecipherable]. They asked her what\u2019s your name, and I told you she gave her maiden name, Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, and as an afterthought they said -- she said, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen.\u201d And they Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  25 asked her, \u201cIf you\u2019re an American citizen, where did you live in the United States? Give us an address.\u201d And she rattled off 121 LaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston. And it\u2019s a wonderful thing, because it was one of the addresses where we had lived in 1929, when my parents for three years, emigrated from Holland to the United States. It was a lousy year to come to the States, 1929, my father got sick, he got tuberculosis, and so on, everything went wrong. In 1932 they returned again to Holland. But they did live at 121 LaMartine Street, Jamaica Plains, Boston, and my mother remembered it, and rattled it off in front of the Gestapo, and they wrote it down. They must have laughed, but they wrote it down. So, now we go back to Bergen-Belsen, and it\u2019s January 1945, and things are really getting bad in Bergen-Belsen. I -- Sorry, I have to s-suddenly think of S Spiegelman\u2019s, \u201cMaus Two,\u201d which bears the title -- when his father arrives in Bergen Belsen, either from Auschwitz, or wherever he came from, some horror, comes to Bergen-Belsen, and says, \u201cAnd here\u2019s where my troubles really began.\u201d It\u2019s -- It\u2019s tragic, but it\u2019s funny. Anyway, my mother came to Bergen-Belsen, and here\u2019s where our troubles really began. Sh -- Her friend said, \u201cGo to this S -- SS guy.\u201d My mother said, \u201cWhy, ba, ba.\u201d Says, \u201cGo, go, go anyway. So what do you have to lose?\u201d So she went to this barracks, there was an SS guy sitting, and he was just closing the books, and sh -- he said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, I hear you\u2019re checking on people with foreign papers?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I just finished.\u201d And she begged him to open the book again, and he opened the list again, and he said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  26 And she said, \u201cAngeline Elizabeth Van Leer.\u201d And he went down the list and he said, \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said, \u201cyou get yourself ready, and two days from n-now, you will be -- you will be exchanged for a German.\u201d And she didn\u2019t believe a word for it -- of it, you know? But two days later, there was a train standing. There was not a railroad spur into Bergen Belsen camp, as you may ha -- may know, but there was -- people had to walk for two miles outside of the camp to -- to Bergen-Belsen, or Belsen-Bergen station, whatever it was. And there was a train standing there with a big red cross on it, and she went in there with 301 other Bergen-Belsen inmates, and as she came in -- she tells this all later on, I\u2019m re -- I\u2019m retelling now what she told to my brother Fred in interviews later on. She said there was an SS sitting there at a little table, and she said, \u201cCould I have a little water? I\u2019m very thirsty.\u201d She had been walking. And he said, \u201cSit down, you\u2019re going to get coffee soon.\u201d And of course, she didn\u2019t believe a word of that, either, but a little later, a nurse came in with a tray with real coffee, whi -- nobody had seen in years. And then she began to believe that maybe it wasn\u2019t a ruse, you know? What they used to do to Germans wa -- load 1,000 people in the train, promising them to go to -- you know, be freed, and they, you know, two days later, they\u2019d be all gassed in Auschwitz, or Sobibor. So that train really started out and went through -- was very secure, there\u2019s a route - route through Germany, and my mother later on says very gleefully, they all saw the bombed out cities of Germany. We\u2019re talking now January 1945, of course. We\u2019re approaching the end of the war. And that train would up in, I forget, Saint Dollan, I think Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  27 she mentioned. It\u2019s in Switzerland. And they came in on one side of the -- of the platform, and -- an-and another train came on the other side, and they were exchanged for Germans. And I got to tell you the rest of this, because otherwise what I tell you later makes no sense. The first night, they spent, sh -- this is a footnote to the Swiss treatment of dying -- 300 s -- terribly sick and dying Bergen-Belsen inmates. They put them in an abandoned school building on straw, and for the few -- first meal, my mother said, \u201cThey gave us white bread, and cans of sardines.\u201d And she said -- she couldn\u2019t help herself, she said she opened the can of sardines and poured the oil in the sardines over the white bread, and just ate and ate and ate. And she said, \u201cI never was as sick in the camp as I was that night.\u201d And finally she found some relief in the morning by throwing up. It was a terrible night, she said. She\u2019d never been so sick in all those -- in all her -- all her time in -- in the -- in the camps, or in hiding. And it got to be morning, and the others were still asleep, I think, and a little boy came by, and she had been in camp, and hadn\u2019t -- did not know what was happening in the world. And she asked the boy if it was possible to get a newspaper somewhere, and he said he could, and he ran off, and he came back with a newspaper, a Swiss newspaper, and she opened it. It said January 21\u2018, and she was free. Now magical things, you know? That\u2019s amazing. My mother was a pretty amazing person. Anyway, the train went on, or another train, and they wound up in Marseilles, and there she was given a choice. She could go either to her sister in Massachusetts, or she could go to Palestine. And she decided she -- and the third choice was she could go to Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  28 United Nations rehabilitation camp someplace. And she decided she\u2019d go to her sister in Massachusetts, and for there there was a -- a ship lying there, the Gripsholm, Scandinavian ship. And that was transporting wounded American soldiers. And she was already on board of the ship, and then suddenly she changed her mind, and she ran off, and one of the officers there said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this, you already,\u201d -- but sh -- he could never impress my mother, and she ran off the -- off the ship, and said she changed her mind, she wanted to go to rehabilitation camp, United Nations camp. And so they put her on another boat, and I think they traveled for a whole week over the Mediterranean, I don\u2019t know why it took so damn long, but she finally wound up in a United Nations rehabilitation camp called Jeandark, which was located in Philipville, in Algiers, North Africa. That\u2019s where she stayed until the end of the war. Now, okay, we\u2019ll leave her there, sitting there, safe. Go back to Forthausen, where we were in hiding in the little cottage, and we are a couple of weeks liberated, and I could tell you many stories, I don\u2019t know how long you want to do this interview. I could tell you a funny -- I think I really should tell you this story, cause it is so funny. The Canadians came, and we spent three days in a dugout shelter, until -- under a fierce artillery bombardment, and then we came out, and we were free, and the Canadians settled all around us in camps, and there were tanks there, and God knows, and it was -- it was wonderful. But we didn\u2019t have anything much more to eat, so my father went -- and we had been making something that was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  29 called coffee, but it was made out of ground up shells of -- of -- what do you call that fruit that comes from a oak tree?"

Anyway, my father set off, and he went to Barnfeld, and as he -- and now I\u2019 Il have to quote him, because he tells this later, also in the interview, he -- he -- he reaches Barnfeld, and he goes there into a building, and behind a rickety table, he find three older -- older men, yeah, three older, Jewish men, and the -- and they said, \u201cCan we help you?\u201d And as -- he said, \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and -- and I\u2019m trying to express this as naive as we were still.

And as he tells it later, he said, \u201cThere I saw the three men again,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they weren\u2019t the same.\u201d He said physically they were the same, but mentally they were completely Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  33 beaten down. They said, \u201cMr. Lessing, we have just found out about concentration camps, and there were gas chambers there. And there\u2019s a very -- hardly anybody 1s alive still.\u201d In my speeches I always say this is the moment that they found out what we now call the Holocaust. We didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know what happened to those trains that left every Tuesday out of Westerbork to that work relief in Germany. My father found out then, right there and then. And they found it out, too. So, it was a terrible thing, and - and -- and they said that we have lists, but there\u2019s hardly anybody on them. He said, \u201cThey all murdered? Murdered?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cWell,\u201d my father said, \u201cbut, could you just look, maybe my wife is on there?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, we give you very little chance, Mr. Lessing,\u201d he didn\u2019t want to [indecipherable]. And he went down the list, Red Cross list, and he said, \u201cBut she\u2019s here, your wife is here.

My father said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible, cause we never had anything to do with Africa. We never were in Africa.\u201d He said, \u201cTha -- those -- that\u2019s ca-can\u2019t be,\u201d you know? And as he said that, the little old man got kind of insulted, and he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, the Red Cross never makes a mistake. She must be there. Now, you better go home and tell your children.\u201d And so my father went back, and he came back, and he told https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  34 us, \u201cYour mother is alive.\u201d It was exactly a year, practically to the day that she was arrested.

So, my father and I fixed up this new abode as well as we could. We put the furniture, which was all disjointed pieces, you know, I mean, non matching pieces, and where we thought it would do the best good, and -- and we hung up curtains on strings, and -- and that\u2019s how we started out. And my brothers went back to school. God, I wished I could read to you the piece that my brother wrote about going back to school. He was -- See, born in 1936, must have been about nine years old when he went back to school. He wrote recently in a speech to the Michigan State Assembly, he -- he wrote a little piece about going back to school. He said that we were -- as if nothing had happened, open your book to page number 25, and he said, after two and a half years of being shit, you know, after being in hiding, after -- after denying our -- our  Our -- Our -- Our -- OUr names, and our religion, and -- it was like -- I mean, the way he says it, a beautiful speech. Anyway, the boys went back to school, and right around the corner there was a -- there were buildings of the university, and they became a -- a -- a pr- a prisoner of war camp for -- for Germans. And the engl -- There were English soldiers guarding them, and every day we would see them march through town, you know, they went to -- God knows what they did. Oh, they -- they -- I don\u2019t know what they did, and  and then one day, something magic hap -- magical happened. My brothers, who would go and hang around there, to see those German prisoners there in the camp, and they\u2019re looking through the gates, and one day they came, and there were no longer English Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  36 soldiers there, they were soldiers who had a Jewish star on their sleeve. And it said, Jewish Brigade. They came home, and they said, \u201cThey had Jewish soldiers there.\u201d I don\u2019t know, but my father and I didn\u2019t believe a word at first. What do you mean Jewish sol -- there are no Jewish soldiers. So we went to look, son of a bitch, there was these euys, just like the English standing there, you know, guarding the gate. So, the way that my brother told it later on, my -- my little brothers went there, and they -- they said, \u201cHow do we make clear to them that we are Jewish boys?\u201d So, my brother Ott, who was always kind of inventive, said, \u201cYeah, I know something. Let\u2019s go, and I\u2019ll stand next to him, and I\u2019Il sing us the only Jewish song I know.\u201d And he started to hum, didn\u2019t know any words. And he started [sings notes] which I think it -- I\u2019m not quite sure what it is, but he said -- 1t\u2019s a well known song, I think, that people sing at Passover, or you know. And the soldier looked at him, and said, \u201cCome here.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you Jewish boys?\u201d They said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cCome in.\u201d And they brought them into the camp, and they became the mascots of that battalion, and every day trucks would pull up in front of the house, and soldiers\u2019d say, \u201cAre the boys here? We want to take them up to a trip.\u201d And it was all wonderful. In August, I think, 1945, I came back from a Zionist meeting in The Hague. We lived again in Delft, which is about 20 minutes by train one way. I came back from The Hague, from a Zionist meeting. My cousin had said, \u201cYou better go to The Hague, there\u2019s a group of kids there, they all were in hiding, and they sing songs, and they dance, and then there are also nice girls there.\u201d Well, I -- here I was, I was 18 or 19, never been https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  37 kissed, never been to bed with a girl, you know? I mean, my teenage years were gone. Girls, God. I wa -- In no time, I was on the train, and it was wonderful. There was all these boys and girls, and then there were the soldiers of the Jewish Brigade, who brought food and drink, and they took us for weekends, and I joined this Zionist group. There\u2019s also a girl there called Carla Hymons, but she was three years younger, and kind of a kid. I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to her. Course, now I been married to her for 50 years. Anyway, I came back one evening from a Zionist meeting, Sunday -- Sunday morning, came back. It was -- It was dusk, and I approached our new home, and there was an English army truck standing in front of the house, which was nothing special, because the- the Jewish Brigade always had trucks standing there in -- but a-as I ran by, from under that -- that camouflage canvas, a woman\u2019s voice called, and said, \u201cOh sir, could you tell me where the Lessings live?\u201d It was my mother\u2019s voice. I\u2019ve always been warned, when doing interviews for the Shoah Foundation, watch out, departures and reu -- when people reunite, that\u2019s when people start to cry, and it\u2019s true. It always -- It always happens that way, because that was my mother -- my mother\u2019s voice, and I barely had strength to -- to say, \u201cMother, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s Eddie.\u201d And she came out of that truck, not at all what we expected. She was all tanned. She came in an army jumpsuit. I mean, we ex-expected this Bergen-Belsen emaciated, sick person, but of course, she had recuperated marvelously out there in Algiers, and as a matter of fact, typically like my mother, in no time at all, I understand, a few weeks after she arrived there, she was in charge of the office already. Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  38 Anyway, there she was, and we rang the doorbell, and my father came, and -- and he was just, you know, he just -- he kept on saying to her, \u201cJust sit down, I just want to look at you.\u201d And she walked around [indecipherable] and she had -- she had boxes full of stuff to eat. And we had saved one chocolate bar, that had fallen out of the sky one day when we were still hiding in that little cottage during the winter of 1944 - \u201945. The English made a mistaken drop of an enormous amount of weapons and radios, and also food canisters. And I had managed to get one of the food canisters, and hide it until the Germans had taken everything. The Germans had been warned, and they came and took everything, but they didn\u2019t get this. Out of that, we had saved, for all those months, one little chocolate bar for my mother when she -- when she would come back, maybe. And here she was with boxes full of stuff, you know, with chocolates, and cigarettes, and whatever she could have got of there, out in that -- anyway, well there she was. She had flown back -- two bombers had flown from Algiers to Paris, and as I later h-heard -- this is -- I mean, this is the God damnedest ironic and horrible thing, one of the -- one of the bombers, w-with survivors, had flown from Algiers back to Europe, to France. Most of them were Dutch. One of them -- One of the planes crashed, and everybody was killed, but the other one arrived in Paris, and my mother from there hitchhiked, [indecipherable] and finally wound up in front of our house, and there she was. And my brother Ott, in his hurry to see her, he fell down the stairs, I remember. He rolled down two floors of -- of stairs, and it was pandemonium, but it was glorious, glorious, glorious. And my mother https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  39 walked around, and she said, \u201cOh, beautiful, this 1s -- 1s this ours? And my father said, \u201cYes, this is our h-home now.\u201d And she said, \u201cOh look at all the furniture you have, and  and,\u201d -- this is the -- my father telling, you know, again, a little story, a mini story, he says, and she walked around, and she said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so beautiful, and -- and look, you even put curtains, and I,\u201d -- she was so impressed. She said -- But the next morning, when she got up, she said, \u201cWell, the couch 1s not right there, we got to move that, and those curtains, they got to go. Th-That\u2019s -- That\u2019s a mess, and,\u201d he said -- my father starts shifting everything. Typically, like a woman. And then my brother said, \u201cMom, there are Jewish soldiers around in, and they guarding prisoners of war.\u201d You know what my mother said? She said, \u201cI never want to see another Jew in my life.\u201d Oh, it was shocking. However, three weeks later, at a party in the Jewish Brigade, Italian camp, she was a performer, she was an amateur singer. She sang Yiddish and Jewish songs for them, and she just loved it, so."

So, my mother was back, and I went back to Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  41 school. Now I was -- I was a terrible scholar, I -- I -- I had been to high school, and failed, had been held back. In -- In -- In desperation my father had asked a neighbor, \u201c\u201cWh-What should I do with my son?\u201d And the neighbor had said, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s a good profess -- send him to trade school, he learn profession.\u201d And then my father, \u201cWhat -- What kind of a trade school?

And I wasn\u2019t very happy in the kibbutz. I had already tasted individual life, and it was very hard to adjust. I had been an independent guy.

Before Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  54 that, I had two brothers, but they were eight and 10 years younger. They were always together, like twins, and I was by myself out there, you know, 10 years older. So, I had worked in the States, I had worked in Holland, in my own profession, and here I was a tractor driver. So I wasn\u2019t too happy there. My daughter got sick, she got tuberculosis, which runs in the family, and almost died in the hospital. And strangely enough, we had not made any decision to go back to the United States, but it -- it happened through a bunch of strange coincidences. I had no family in Israel, none whatsoever, all my family was in the United States, and it was quite a -- quite a group by then. My two brothers, my father and mother, my cousins had come over, with wives, with their children. It grew here in the States, all around Springfield, and so on. And I was -- I was sitting out in -- 1 in Israel, and everybody was poor, they didn\u2019t have money to travel to Israel to -- in those days everything was different, you know, you didn\u2019t say, \u201cOh well, we go, you know, spend a couple of weeks in Israel,\u201d you know, wh-what the hell, a couple of thousand bucks, so what? 20 dollars was a lot of money.

And my mother wants us -- when we -- when we left the United States to go to Israel, Carla and I, we had asked for a re-entry permit, which you needed in those days. You needed a re-entry permit if you wanted to come back into the States, as a non citizens. We weren\u2019t citizens, you know? I had sent the money to Washington, but the re entry permit never came. Oh, we said, so what. It was just -- It was like a -- a -- a safety Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  55 line in -- in case we wouldn\u2019t like it in -- in Israel, then we could always come back.

We sent the money, but we didn\u2019t get it.\u201d She -- Well, my mother being well, my mother, immediately spoke with her senator. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on here? My son sent money to Washington for re-entry permit.\u201d \u201cI\u20191] look into it.\u201d Two weeks later a letter came from the embassy in Tel Aviv, that, \u201cYou are hereby requested to reapply for a visa to the United States,\u201d and I hadn\u2019t planned to apply for a visa -- send photographs. And we thought, well, my daughter hadn\u2019t been s -- been so sick, and almost died, and maybe we should go back for some time, and -- well, from there it rolled on and on and on and on. They needed photographs, you needed documents, you need to go to the local police to tell you that you were a good character. And one day a letter arrived in the kibbutz, and somebody in -- the letters in the kibbutz all come to the office, and then they get distributed. And somebody in the office said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to open this letter.\u201d He opened our letters from the embassy, and said, \u201cHey, these people are applying to go back to the United States.\u201d Now, it\u2019s hard to imagine at this point in the history of Israel, but then, if you left the kibbutz, just leave it and go to the city, you were an outcast already, sort of. They would give you a table, and two chairs and a bed, and 20 bucks, and goodbye Charlie, that was nice of you to be in the kibbutz. We don\u2019t want to have further anything to do with you.

There are two words in Israel, one it alleyah, which means going up, when you go to Israel, you make alleyah, you go to Israel, you go up. The word El Al comes from there, by the way, the airline. When you leave Israel, you yurate, you go down. We were yuradeem, people who go down. It was, again the word ashander, an-and it was a terrible thing. And in the general meeting, in the kibbutz, the members decided that we had no right to live there any more, even though we had worked for five years, our butts off, and all that, but -- and we had been bona fide members, they voted us out. But they didn\u2019t want to throw us out right away, first -- they would throw us out as soon as I found a job, some -- outside of the kibbutz. So I went, and I applied for a job, and I got a job as a draftsman, in an English company, the refineries, the oil refineries in Haifa. And I don\u2019t know any more what happened, but we didn\u2019t -- we decided that we wouldn\u2019t stay in Israel after all. However, we couldn\u2019t go to the United States either, because of my daughter\u2019s tuberculosis that she had had. They took x-rays, and they said, \u201cYou'll have to wait a year.\u201d In those days tuberculosis was like AIDS today. You had it, you didn\u2019t get into the States, and that was the worst. So, they said, \u201cYou'll have to wait a year.\u201d And I don\u2019t know, we decided, you know what, if we have to wait a year, let\u2019s go to Holland, and we\u2019ll wait a year there, and then we\u2019ll apply to the American embassy there. And so we got on a ship, and left Israel with our daughter, and went back to Holland, and we lived there for one year in 1956. I went back to the same place where I had worked before as a draftsman, found out about a new profession that I had never Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  37 heard about, and immediately decided that was the profession that I wanted to learn. It was called industrial design. I\u2019d never heard of it. It was ideal for me. It was a combination of art, and technology. Industrial designers are the people who design cars on the outside, and telephones and refrigerators, and -- in other words, people who give shape to modern industrial products. Anyway, we spent a year in Holland, had a wonderful time. One of the best years of our lives, I don\u2019t know why, but it was just wonderful. My daughter, in quick succession, dropped her Hebrew, which she spoke fluently, and learned Dutch, and at the end of the year, when we went to the United States, she dropped her Dutch, and in three weeks spoke fluent English. So, went through three languages in no time at all. And so we got back to the United States."

No, it -- I guess there was something like that, but I\u2019m not sure that that influenced us at all. We lived with a little group of o-other Dutch kibbutznikim, some of who had also gone through hiding, and we worked hard, we got children, and we didn\u2019t talk about the war, talked about everything but the war.

We came back, and of course now we had a daughter, and I started looking around for a job, and an apartment, and we -- we found that in the next village where - from where we are right now, in Dobb\u2019s Ferry. And I started a job with a -- with an instrument company. Let\u2019s see, a son -- we got a son. He was born here in the -- in here, in the area, and we moved from an apartment in Dobb\u2019s Ferry to this house in Hastings, years ago. In the meantime, I started going to school at night. I went to Pratt Institute, and got a degree in Industrial design, and started working on Madison Avenue, and then got laid off there, because they ran out of work. This is just about the time Kennedy got assassinated. And then I sort of slid into doing free lance work for myself. And life went on, and Carla started going to school, and she graduated, and she -- she first went -- got a Bachelors, and then she got a Master\u2019s from Columbia, and she became a Social Worker. And was all -- that was a great accomplishment for us, because we had missed our education in a sense. So now I was free-lancing, and then -- and I got a studio in New York City for awhile, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42\" Street, in a prestigious building, and a -- we were very busy, and the kids were growing up, and so on and so forth. I thought that our life -- my life would be pretty well without surprises further on. I Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  62 looked at it -- I forget what birthday that was, but it\u2019Il be my 40\" -- my 40\" would have - would have been in \u201966, right? Born in \u201926. Anyway, somewhere, one of these birthdays, I said, \u201cWell, I think I\u2019ve seen it about.\u201d You know? Sounds a little cynical, but I had a big birthday party, and at the end of the day I thought, probably it\u2019s going to go on until my death wi -- about the same way, you know? With working, and kids growing up and leaving the home, and so on and so forth, and -- and two things happened. Actually, three things happened, but -- but the first one happened in -- let me see, I think 19 -- 19 -80. [inaudible] 1980? 1981. My wife got involved with a couple of other ladies in setting up a -- something that hadn\u2019t been done before, a special kind of meeting of people who had been in hiding. And now, she was always involved in reading Holocaust literature, and especially Dutch 1s -- tr -- poetry, and stories written by Holocaust survivors. I never touched it. My brother sent me the standard work in Holland, about the destruction of the Dutch Jewry, a two volume book, and it stood on the shelf. I once looked, there were a couple of photographs in it, I was horrified, I put it back on the shelf, never touched it. Anyway, in 1981, she started to organize this -- this business with -- but before that, there was an article in New York magazine, I\u2019m sure she had -- she must have told you about all this -- was an article in New York magazine in which there was a- a couple of stories, a bunch of stories of -- of hidden -- what they suddenly were called, hidden children, children who had been in hiding. It hit the -- It hit the -- the -- the -- the  the -- the media, you know? In short order, CBS, NBC, ABC, the magazines, Time, I Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  63 don\u2019t know, Newsweek, everybody wanted to know -- a new buzz word there was, hidden children, who had ever heard of hidden children? Here we had been for 50 years surrounded -- now we -- we didn\u2019t think about it ourselves. Anyway, that\u2019s the time we got in -- we got asked to be interviewed by the Holocaust museum, I guess, and in short order we -- I got onto all kinds of television programs. I was on CNBC, we were -- the whole family was on ABC Good Morning America, and -- it was amazing -- amazing time. Anyway, the conference was in sight. It was on Memorial Day, 1981, I think. And Carla said to me, \u201cAre you coming to this conference?\u201d She had been very busy organizing this. I had heard the news, you know, and -- and -- and I -- I think my --  a answer was -- is -- is a classic by now, I -- I said, \u201cAh no, why should I come? I mean, you will be busy, running around here -- there -- at the conference, and I'll just be hanging out, you know, waiting til it\u2019s over.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cyou know, my brother is especially coming from Israel, and he\u2019ll be wandering around by himself. Couldn\u2019t you just come?\u201d And I said, \u201cAll right, all right.\u201d I\u2019ve been married for many years, you learn when to -- when to be acquiescent, you know? And so, there we gathered, on Memorial Day weekend, in -- on Times Square in the -- in the Marriott. And I think it was Friday night when the first registration was supposed to be on, and I -- Carla was busy up there on the seventh floor. They were -- They had the -- like, sort of places where you could register. And I positioned myself between those windows, where people stood behind them, had all these kits for they -- for those who had registered, and the elevators. Now Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  64 the elevators 1-1-in -- in that hotel are made out of glass, sort of. They -- They -- They rise from -- from -- from the bottom on the -- in -- in an atrium. And then, when they come to the floor, they open up, and they disgorge their people. And I stood there, and I watched the elevators bringing up these people, these gray haired men and women, of all kinds of heights and sizes, and girth, and -- and then I saw them go to the -- to the windows there, where the volunteers of -- were standing, and they were getting their kits, and then they got the tags, and they put the tags on, and they wrote on there where -- who they were, and where they had been in hiding. And I can\u2019t -- to this day I cannot explain to you, but as they got -- started to crowd around on the floor, and I began to read their tags, sort of furtively, you know, I wasn\u2019t with anyone, and they began to form groups and talk, and I looked at the tags, and the tags said, I was hidden in Belgium, I was hidden in France, I was hidden in Holland. I came from Poland, I came from Romania. And this -- very strange, but I began to cry. I began to cry, and it was to me as if I always had believed that I was the only one who had been in hiding. Is a thing so strange, I mean, I knew, you know. I mean, my o -- my own brothers, and friends, and everybody had been -- but here they were, the hidden children, s -- 1600 of them. And they crowded around, and they talked, and I just stood and looked at them, and I cried. And they were suddenly like I had all these brothers and sisters, but of course, I had very little in common with most of them, sum -- you know. There was very little in common between somebody who has been in hi -- in hiding in Poland, and somebody who has been hi -- in hiding in -- in Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  65 France, let\u2019s say, or in Belgium. The situation w-were vastly different, but it didn\u2019t matter. And the conference started up, and Carla\u2019s brother came, and we sat in the conference, 1600 people, we listened to Abe Foxman, you know, of the Anti-Defamation League, who was a hidden child. And we listened to other people. And I cried, and everybody cried. I cried for three days. Something magical happened there. I, who had never read a book on the Holocaust, I suddenly was -- it was like, I don\u2019t know, like my mind opened up suddenly to something that I could -- you asked me, did you t -- earlier, did you talk about the war, either in New Yor -- in -- in the Zionist organization or in the kibbutz? Never a word. Carla and I didn\u2019t talk about the war with each other. And it happened there. It changed my life. I -- It went on for three days, and wherever I went, I talked with people, and they talked to me, and I got to tell you funny thing, that people never stopped talking, and they couldn\u2019t get enough of telling what happened to them, as if they had never -- as if -- as if they had never told it to anyone, you know. Or maybe they didn\u2019t. It was -- It was so bad, I stood in the men\u2019s room next to a guy -- next -- the  the guy next to me in the urinal said to me, \u201cSo, where were you in hiding?\u201d And I said in Holland. I said, \u201cSo where were you in hiding?\u201d He said, \u201cI was in Poland.\u201d And we talked while we peed. And even there, you didn\u2019t stop talking with -- and -- and [indecipherable] what happened to me, and then we zipped up, and then we talked some more outside. It was astounding. It was an astounding experience. And when it was over, three days later, we left, and it was as if I had suddenly acquired, you know, like 1600 Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  66 sisters and brothers. I didn\u2019t want to leave. Nobody wanted to leave. There were people sitting downstairs in the lobby that -- that cried because it was over. When you ask people today, who were at that conference, they all remember it exactly. I was there. I experienced it. It was as if the door suddenly opened, after 50 years. It was as if we were suddenly allowed to remember. Anyway, I went home, it was very strange, as -- the car was in the garage downstairs, as I drove out, an enormous thunderstorm broke out over Manhattan. The sky was blue with lightning every second, and the rain poured down, and it thundered b-between those buildings, it sounded -- it was like hell had broken loose, it was like God himself sort of thundered out on -- on us for -- you know, it was very strange. Got home, started reading every -- every book, every pamphlet, every story I could lay my hands on. And my life changed. It -- It\u2019s never been the same. I became a speaker, became an interviewer for a -- Spielberg\u2019s Shoah Foundation. I -- I\u2019m a-about the best speaker they have of the Hidden Child Foundation. I spoke last month at the commemoration at the Supreme Court of New York state, to the judges and the lawyers. It\u2019s -- All this happened after that day. So -"

Here is where suddenly everything changed. No, no, come back in another 10 years, maybe Ill have an answer. Maybe Carla had an answer, I\u2019m not quite sure. Anyway, I became quite active, slowly, not -- not immediately, but Carla, of course, had the - became vice-president of The Hidden Child Foundation, and I -- I began to -- and she formed a group here in Westchester, and I decided that my forte was maybe writing some things, I have written little pieces, and I began to write a newsletter, every month I write a newsletter, there\u2019s only two pages, but I love to write a little editorial for it, and I\u2019ve written those, and -- and then later I started a newsletter, same thing, two page newsletter for The Hidden Child Foundation in New York, and that has a circulation of about 3,000 people, and that goes around, you know, the -- the whole New York region.

I spoke Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  68 to, I don\u2019t know, maybe 15 - 20 places this -- during the Holocaust commemoration season, you know, these -- these speech days come in seasons.

In 1982, there was a decision that in -- of the Dutch Jews, that they would hold a conference for hidden children in Amsterdam.

I thought, I wonder if Oskam is still li -- I didn\u2019t know his name. I wonder if that police officer is still alive. And I couldn\u2019t find his name in my mind. I asked my brother Fred, who did all the interviews, he said, \u201cYeah, something like Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  69 Boscamp, or something like that.\u201d Anyway, I sent a letter to the Bureau of War dec - documentation in Amsterdam, and said -- described the hut where I had been, and described Oskam, and I sent a little picture, a little photograph of Oskam, his wife, and their son, who was then three and a half, four years old, and sent it off to war document - and asked them, is Mr. Oskam -- Mr. Boscamp, or whatever his name 1s still alive, and I described him.

But his son, Oskam junior is still alive, and he\u2019s a retired plumber, and we sent your letter with the photograph, on to him.\u201d So I got a letter back from Oskam, junior. And he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I don\u2019t know who you are, but I\u2019m very grateful for the little photograph you sent me, I\u2019ve never seen that photograph.\u201d Of course he hadn\u2019t, because I had taken it just before I left for the United States.

My father was a very closed man. I -- I don\u2019t know what to -- what I could tell you.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care, but I would like to find out a little bit about your father, who was he, what -- what background did he come from.\u201d Suddenly, I- it had to do with the whole hidden children business, too. Suddenly I decided I must find out about what happened to me. I must find out what happened to all the Jews during Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  70 the Holocaust, and here was a chance. So I wrote to him, we\u2019re coming to Holland, and can we meet with you. And he said, \u201cYeah, okay. I don\u2019t know what I can do for you, but okay.\u201d We go on the plane, and we are 10 minutes away from Amsterdam airport Schiphol, and the captain comes on. As they always do, it\u2019s, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, thank you for flying KLM, we\u2019ll be landing in 10 minutes in Schiphol, and don\u2019t forget any of your stuff,\u201d whatever, you know. And I burst out in crying -- crying, next to Carla. I\u2019m sobbing sitting there. She said, \u201c\u201cWhat happened, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said, \u201cThis shit makes no sense at all, but when we land, when this plane land in Schiphol, I see at the end of the runway, there\u2019s a line of black trucks, with SS, waiting for me, and they will kill me.\u201d A direct remembrance of the morning of the raid in the woods. And she said, \u201cWell, you know that that\u2019s not true.\u201d I said, \u201cI know that\u2019s not true,\u201d but that\u2019s how I felt it. It was like -- It was like I was right back there, you know? Well, we wer -- We landed, of course, and my cousin was there with her little blue Honda, and of course the SS disappeared from my mind. Anyway, the next day we meet Oskams, junior. By this time I found out the name is Oskam, not Boscamp, and Oskam ju -- Oskam junior, who doesn\u2019t look at all like his father, but he looks like his mother, you know, have a round face, and round body, and very jolly guy, and he\u2019s a retired plumber, and then we meet him in this tiny little doll\u2019s house, like they have in Holland. The whole house fits about in this -- in this room, you know? And they have the coffee, and the cake, as always in Holland, you know, you have to eat coffee, and you know, and big cakes with great Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  71 almond paste in it, lovely. And we sitting down, and we meet his wife, and -- so he said, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I said, \u201cWell I -- I didn\u2019t know who your father was, really, because it was all so secret.\u201d And he tells me a little bit about his father, and it comes out that Oskam came from a family of all Nazis, Dutch Nazis, and bad ones, anti-Semites. People who tried to discover where Jews were hidden, and found them, and -- and denounced them to the Germans. The worst. The whole family was one big heap of garbage, you know? He was the only good one. But because the whole family was so bad, his reputation was -- was bad -- for the Germans was excellent, because he came from this virulent Nazi family, they thought he was so too, and when -- when I show you a picture of him, he looks like it, like a Nazi in black uniform, and everything. He was a good man. Anyway, we\u2019re talking, and he tells me about this br -- his father, and then - and then I said, \u201cListen, did you know there was a hut in the woods not far from here?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes, I -- I knew that, my father told me that.\u201d I said, \u201cDid you know who was in the hut?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. My father didn\u2019t tell me too much about it.\u201d I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that I was in there?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, I -- I don\u2019t.\u201d He said to me, \u201cWhy are you asking me these questions?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I had this crazy idea,\u201d -- all this comes after the revelations in 1991, the conference. I -- I had to find out everything now. I said, \u201cI thought if maybe there were a group of men in there, and I probably saw them for the last time when they were alive. And I thought maybe a brother or a sister, or maybe even a father or a mother might still be alive, and I could tell them at least, for that Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  72 last morning, when we ran into the hut and warned them, and,\u201d -- and he\u2019s listening to me, and he says to me, \u201cBut Mr. Lessing, I just want to tell you something wrong with your story.\u201d Is -- And I thought, \u201cWhat the hell does he know? He was four years old at the time.\u201d I-I -- I said, \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s something wrong with my story?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know much what happened there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know one thing. Nobody was arrested that morning. They all escaped.\u201d Now, you\u2019ve got to realize, for 50 years I have lived with the idea, on and off, not every day, not every week, but at least once a month, I would think about the morning of the raid on the hut, and how we stormed in, my buddy and I, and warned the men, and pulled the blankets off them, and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a raid, it\u2019s the SS, get up, the Germans are here.\u201d And then, when we saw that they were all up and out and awake, we fled. And always the question came up, we should have stayed, maybe. We should have stayed with them, helped them more. But then it went in my mind, then, not the seven that were there, but we would have been caught, too, and we\u2019d have been killed. This way, there were seven killed, at least two escaped. And that went on through the years, this feeling of guilt that we -- I didn\u2019t stay long enough. I should have spent more time there. I -- I -- So what? I might have been killed with them, but -- but then that didn\u2019t make any sense. We did warn them, and you know, and we did our best, and so we couldn\u2019t help it, you know, this kind of stuff. And here this man tells me they all escaped. So instead of being guilty of maybe not doing enough, it now comes out, I\u2019ve actually saved their lives, or helped save their lives. So, I https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  73 come out of that conference with this man -- this man, and my cousin is there, and she says, \u201cSo, how was it?\u201d I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t believe this. The men whom I thought were killed, all survived.\u201d \u201cGod,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s amazing. Who were they?\u201d I said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know either.\u201d By the way, I should backtrack for one second. At the beginning of the conference of my talk -- it is not a conference, but a talk with -- with Oskam junior, he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I went into the basement to see if there\u2019s anything I could find on my father, and you know, there were thousands of paper my father had gathered through the years. They were all the old tickets that he had given to people,\u201d you know, where you don\u2019t have a -- you don\u2019t have a na -- an a -- license plate in the back of your car, or people didn\u2019t have a | -- a light on the front of their bicycle, and there were thousands of those tickets, or copies of tickets. And he said, \u201cI threw all those away. I saved a few things,\u201d and he came up with a picture. \u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cI have something here, and it had -- was sent to my father by your mother.\u201d I said, \u201cMy mother? From where?\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It looks like from Africa someplace. Algiers?\u201d He fishes out -- now this is 1992 I\u2019m talking about, so it\u2019s seven years ago, he digs out of there a postcard sent by my mother, to his father, saying that she came out of Bergen-Belsen, she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s the mat -- what -- what happened to her husband and s -- and her -- and her three sons. She wonder if they\u2019re still alive. Would he know something more? And he hands me this postcard, it was like a postcard you get after somebody dies, and it reaches you. It wasn\u2019t addressed to me, but it was my https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  74 mother\u2019s, she had written it, you know? She had typed it on the office typewriter there. I have it here. That\u2019s how it started out already. He says, \u201cThis something that interests you?\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean it interests me? This is from my mother. She sent it after she came out of Bergen-Belsen, she,\u201d -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s amazing, anyway. You see, life was full of surprises, and -- so anyway, as I said, my cousin said, \u201cDo you know who was in the c -- in -- in that hut?\u2019 I said no. She said to me, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a radio program on here, comes on once a week, on Friday morning, it\u2019s called Address Unknown, goes on the Catholic radio station, and they interview people, there\u2019s a guy who interviews people, and -- who are sic -- looking for people they have lost years ago.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, well, you know, I lost people 50 years ago. Sh -- Who the hell would know?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, you could try.\u201d So I call up the radio station, and I got a -- got the producer on the phone, and -- very nice lady, and she said -- I told -- I told her a little bit about this story, and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s a fascinating story, Mr. Lessing. Are you going to be here next month?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I -- I\u2019m here just for a conference, I\u2019m -- got to go back to the United States.\u201d And, she said, \u201cAh, that\u2019s too bad, because it takes us about a month to put program together, you know. We have already,\u201d and so on, so forth. You probably know all about this, and -- okay, we went to the conference -- there\u2019s something else I didn\u2019t tell you, and I should tell you about it.

            "question": "This is a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing. This 1s tape three, side B. You were just talking about going back to Holland.",
            "answer": "I said, \u201cNo, I have to go back to the United States.\u201d And we went to the conference. We went to visit a lady in Brussels who was -- played a part in a friend of mine\u2019s life, and- which I haven\u2019t told you about, and I sort of should backtrack on that later, because it\u2019s an important part also, what happened to me. Anyway, we go to the conference, we come back to my cousin again, who lives in the center of Holland. She lives, by the way, very close to where I had been in hiding in the -- in the hut, and where Oskam junior lives, that\u2019s all around Utrecht, the area they\u2019re in now. So, she says, \u201cCall the radio station, they\u2019ve been calling here all -- all -- all the time.\u201d So I call them up, I get the producer upon the phone. \u201cYeah, Mr. Lessing, we -- we -- we decided that your story is so fascinating. Could you come next Friday morning?\u201d I said, \u201cSure.\u201d So, Friday morning very early, Carla and I went to the radio station, and my cousin went also with us, and - and I said to my -- said, \u201cCarla,\u201d I said, \u201cthis is a waste of time,\u201d sit -- sitting there talking about something that happened 50 years ago, who the hell would remember an obscure hut in an obscure piece of wood somewhere in an obscure little village?\u201d You\u2019re going to get that on. So -- But we were there, and there\u2019s a guy, he was sort of like -- you could say a little bit like, oh, the Letterman of the -- of the Dutch air waves, a very popular man. Hans Frombilihamber, Hans Frombilihamber, should put his name in here. And Hans seats me there, sits me down, and this is an hour program. They make a break after Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  76 the half hour, and then they gave our telephone number, and then people can call in if they have any -- have any [indecipherable]. Anyway, he interviews me, and I tell him the story about the hiding in the woods, and the -- the raid, and I tell him about finding Oskam junior back, and about the terrible surprise, or the wonderful surprise, to find out that I didn\u2019t -- what say -- did do enough, that I helped those people -- to save seven people, to save their lives, and -- and -- and he makes a break, and they play some music, and then the program goes on, and at the end, he says, \u201cWell, thank you very much,\u201d and he -- \u201cPll show you where we have the telephone.\u201d So we go back to a room, and they have a dozen telephones there, and they have six people. And they do this every week, by the way, it\u2019s been going on for years. There\u2019s six people, they take the telephone calls, and they write on slips whatever call comes in. And so, I come there, and these dozen phones are ringing off the hook. And they\u2019ve got a little stack of slips already this big. And they ask me, you know, as it goes on, as they\u2019re writing it, \u201cIs this something?\u201d And they hold it in front of me. And there was very strange things. There\u2019s a -- \u201cYes, my - my sister was in there, in the hut with a dog,\u201d You know, I -- there\u2019s all kinds of stupid things. But, there was one -- th-there were several that were very interesting, one -- once  one was -- said, \u201cMy brother was with you 1n the hut, but he is -- doesn\u2019t live here any more in Holland, he 1 -- lives now in Indonesia, and he -- I\u2019m sure he would love to hear from you.\u201d His name on -- Herman Mueninghof. Okay, I don\u2019t know Herman Mueninghof, you know, but might be true. And a little later, another message comes 1n, it https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  77 says, \u201cI was with you in the hut, and I\u2019m listening to this broadcast, and I live right around the corner from the radio station. Please come and visit me afterwards.\u201d Lou Fontichilin. I don\u2019t know Lou Fontichilin, but it says he was there. So anyway, we got - the phone keeps on ringing, and finla -- finally it dies down, and -- and I got this big stack of p-pieces of paper, and they -- not only -- that -- that\u2019s not where it stops for them, any messages that are important, they research, no matter where they are. They go all over the world, find these people, and make contact with them. Okay, so it was wonderful. We get into my cousin\u2019s little blue Honda, and we go around the corner, and I ring the door of an apartment house, and this huge woman comes out, and throws her arms around me, and says, \u201cEddie, I didn\u2019t think you would make it.\u201d I said, \u201c\u201cWho are you?\u201d She said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember me?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d She says, \u201cMy name was Perk.\u201d Her secret name was Perk during the war, \u201cBut,\u201d she says, \u201cI kept it. Cut me -- Call me Perk Fontichilar. And I remember you very well,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to be courier for the underground.\u201d Vaguely I began to remember something. She says, \u201cCome, Lou wants to meet you.\u201d Leads me into the living room, and there\u2019s an old man sitting, with white hair, but I immediately recognized him as one of the men I had left behind that morning. Ah, we cried, and we hugged, and we did, and -- I tell you, it was like -- couldn\u2019t believe it, that all this was happening. Well, finally we settled down, and his wife brought some coffee, of course, and -- and we talked about the morning, and he said he ran away in his pajamas, and - and without shoes, and everyone managed to get out. I said, \u201cLou, who were the people https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  78 who were in the hut?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I have some photographs that I took in the hut.\u201d I said, \u201cYou do?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, Pll show you.\u201d And he -- his wife brought out a box of photographs, and there was photographs with all the men in the hut, and not only that, but also the Canadian, and the Englishman, the flyers from the RAF on there. But I wasn\u2019t on there. And he said, \u201cBut I also have a picture of you.\u201d I says, \u201cYou do?\u201d And yes, and he came out with a photograph of -- of me standing in the hut, cynical young man."

            "question": "Can you describe it for me?",
            "answer": "Well, what you\u2019re seeing here is -- looking at the bunk beds, the upright posts are made from pine trees that were cut by the men, and you can see there\u2019s an upper bunk, somebody\u2019s si-sitting on there eating a sandwich, and there\u2019s a lower bunk, where somebody\u2019s eating an apple, or something like that, and I\u2019m leaning against one of the posts of the bed, in shorts, and a woolen jacket, and I\u2019m looking directly into the camera. I\u2019m the -- this man that I was talking with, had taken this photograph. It was taken in the fall of 1943, before the hut was raided. Now, I said to Lou -- and he described all the men, and their names. So now I knew who had been in the hut. And then I ask him the final question, I said, \u201cLou, everything is revealed except one thing. Who was my buddy, who was my partner that morning, who stood guard with me that morning, who escaped? Who was the man who my mother gave her bicycle to, and -- and the flashlight?\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, don\u2019t you know?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  79 anything of him?\u201d I said, \u201cI seem to remember a man who was a shoemaker in the regular life.\u201d\u2019 And he said, \u201c\u201cOh, well, he wasn\u2019t a shoemaker, his father was a shoemaker, and his name was,\u201d -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d He says, \u201cHis name was Jan Carman, Jan Carman.\u201d So now I knew who had been my buddy. I said, \u201cWhere is he, what happened to him?\u201d He said, \u201cEd, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re -- it can be, because Jan Carman was with me that morning. We fled together.\u201d I said, \u201cLou, it can\u2019t be, he was with me. I think your memory must be mixed up.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, maybe it is, you know, it\u2019s years ago, and I\u2019m old, and,\u201d -- I said, \u201cWhat happened to Jan Carman?\u201d He said, \u201cHe was with me three weeks later, we were raided in -- in unrelated raid on a house with Jews, and he was- he was taken, and he was executed in the dunes. And he 1s buried in the cemetery for the martyrs, the -- of the Resistance, in Holland.\u201d So the picture changed again. The man who were de -- who I thought were dead, were -- had -- had lived, the two who had escaped, one -- one had been caught, and was -- was executed. So, with that, I went one more -- once more back with -- with Oskam junior, to the place where the hut had been. And then I knew 50 years had gone by, because where there had been an impenetrable wood of young pine trees, now there was a forest you could look right through, with tall pine trees, and you could walk right through it. It poured that morning. It rained cats and dogs. I had a yellow slicker, and one of these plastic coats over me, and it poured, it was a dismal day. And we went to where the hut had been, and the only thing there was was a slight depression in the ground. I tried to find a splinter of wood, a little piece of glass, https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  80 something to take back, and there was nothing. And then finally he took me to the edge of the wood, where I stood that morning and watched the Germans come, and I stood there in the rain, and they distanced themselve a little bit -- there was some more people there. There were people from the -- the -- the nursing home next door. Anyway -- and I stood there, at the same place where I had stood that -- you know. And you know, it\u2019s weird, and it sound very dramatic, but it -- I stood there, and it was almost as if I could hear tires coming up again, up on the road. It was scary, it was scary being there. Must have been a little bit like Holocaust survivors going back to Auschwitz, you know\u2019? Anyway, there is -- there\u2019s too much to tell, because it\u2019s all in little details, there -- the ones who had given us food during the days when we were in the hut, were the nuns next door. Next to the wood was a fence, and then next to that, there was a -- what do they call that, where nuns live?"

In the meantime, it had been converted from a convent to a nursing home for older nuns, and for other Catholics, and these people had heard the broadcast. They had never known what had happened next door to them. And so, I was invited to come to there, and we did that, and then I met some people who had been - that same day had been incarcerated by the SS, who had just been caught hanging around. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  81 The gardener, for instance, of the grounds of the convent had been -- he had come to see what was going on, he was thrown in jail. The Mother Superior, they had knocked on the door of the convent, and when she opened the door, they said, \u201c\u201cWe want to come in,\u201d and- the SS said, and she had said, \u201cYou have nothing to li -- look for here,\u201d and they Slapped her in the face, and she fell on the ground, and they walked right over her, and threw her in jail for three months, also. And Oskam, the policeman, was found walking around with a gun, which he was allowed to have, but in civilian clothes, because he had heard about the raid. And they took him in for awhile, he came back three weeks later, emaciated, and beaten up, and all this stuff was coming out of what had happened that day. Anyway, it was time to go back to the United States. I came -- I had -- I had a bunch of photographs from Lou, and I had made a whole slew of new friends from the radio station, and -- and from, you know, the people, and it was all wonderful. And so Carla and I went back, and I settled down here, in this room, and I\u2019m sitting right here working, in December, 1992, I get a call. \u201cHi, this is Hans Frontikel in Holland, from the radio station, remember me, I\u2019m -- I interviewed you?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, how you doing, Hans?\u201d \u2018Fine. I wonder if you could come to Holland, I have a TV program, and we\u2019re going to do a half an hour on the -- the Dutch Resistance, and also about the Jewish persecution, and I thought you, being involved in both, maybe I could interview you again, but now on television.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, well that\u2019s very nice, but I don\u2019t have a budget to go for 20 minutes to Amsterdam.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d he said, \u201cwe pay your flight, and we pay your hotels Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection  82 and everything.\u201d I said, \u201cI'll be there.\u201d And so all of a sudden I found myself back in s - in December, and this is what happened. H-Hans, my interviewer send his -- wh-what is it called, his -- the guy you -- an -- an editor. Tall guy, and he said, \u201cEd, I would like to go over the story once more with you, just quickly, for the interview, the day after tomorrow.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I said, \u201cFirst of all,\u201d -- no, I -- I -- I -- I said, \u201cOkay, but,\u201d I said, \u201cyou know the story.\u201d \u201cYeah, we sed -- like to -- tell me a little bit shortly, again.\u201d And so I said, \u201cWell,\u201d [indecipherable], it was in the camp, and [indecipherable] you know, and we got raided, and I was -- was out with a buddy, and\u201d -- and he said, \u201cDo you know who your buddy was?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know in August, but now I\u2019ve heard that it was a cert -- a -- a certain Jan Carman.\u201d And they said, \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d And he said -- I -- I -- Is -- I said, \u201c\u201cHe was shot in the dunes. He 1s buried, and,\u201d I said, \u201cI visited his grave yesterday.\u201d I had in the mean time, gone to the graveyard of the Resistance people, and there I cried over Jan\u2019s grave, and -- and -- Tong was his name, Tong, the editor. He said, \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cnow, the day after tomorrow, Ill come and pick you up, and first we\u2019ll go to the museum of the Dutch Resistance.\u201d I said, \u201cOh.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cwell, I want to show you a film there, and,\u201d -- okay. So, we went there, and I sat there, and this was in the former synagogue, and so I sat there, and I watched this film, which seemed like an old film, it didn\u2019t seem -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhy are you showing me this?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI was told to do this,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t figure it out, you know? Anyway, when it was over, we went to the TV studio, and there on the set was a nice https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  83 thick couch, and on the end of the couch was a little Christmas tree, cause the program was going to be aired on -- on Christmas day. And it was a live audience. Oskam junior and his wife was there, and my cousin with her husband were there, and as -- my second cousin from -- from The Hague come over. And I was alone, Carla hadn\u2019t come with me ya -- you know. So, the lights went on, and there was Hans with a nice Christmas tie, and me, in little -- nice little Jewish boy, sitting next to a Christmas tree. So, by then I had been on TV a couple of times, and I had some idea, you know, I was here on channel 13, and I\u2019ve been there with CNBC, and a couple other places, and -- and so I sort of knew what the routine was, you know, and the interviewer asks the questions, and you give the right answers, you know, and don\u2019t embarrass anybody, and you don\u2019t be idiot, you know. So, he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, many will remember you from this summer, when I interviewed you on radio, but now here you are again, and I want to ask you a few questions.\u201d And so he asked me where I was during the war. I said I was in hiding. And where were you in hiding? I -- Well, I was, among other places, was in this hut. And what happened? Well, we were raided. And -- And the interview went along fine, you know, standardized. By then I got a little bit, shall I say, blas\u00a2\u00e9 about the whole thing, you know\u201d? But it was fun to be there, and -- and he said, \u201cSo, Mr. Lessing, what happened?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, we stood guard, a buddy of mine, and -- and -- and I, and we happened to see the Germans coming, and we went back and warned the others, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201cDo you know who your buddy was?\u201d I said, \u201cWell yes, he is Jan Carman, and he -- I visited his Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  84 grave yesterday, and he got executed by the Germans, near the dunes in Holland.\u201d And then he said something that did not fit in the thing, and he said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I want to tell you that we have received a part of a diary of the man -- your buddy, your partner who stood guard with you that morning, describing that morning, the raid, and everything, just like you tell it.\u201d And I thought for a second, and I thought, he is wrong, that can\u2019t be. Cause Jan Carman\u2019s date on his grave says he was -- he was executed in February, 1945 -- 1944, and we were raided on the 29\" of December, 1943. There had only been a couple of weeks in between, and he was on the run all the time, I knew that from Lou. So I thought this -- something -- something is screwed up here, and -- but, you know, live audience, you\u2019re not going to -- so I said, \u201cOh.\u201d And then he said something that really chilled me to the bone. He said, \u201cMr. Lessing, I want to tell you that the man who was with you that morning, who stood guard with you then, was here -- is here to talk with you.\u201d And I became ice cold, and I thought, I just visited his grave, and the dead don\u2019t rise from the grave, and -- and he is so fucked up here, you know with this, I\u2019m sorry, excuse my language, but I didn\u2019t know what to think. And a light went on on the far end of the stage, and this man walks out, tall man, who I\u2019d seen in the photographs, who was described to me as the man who lived in Indonesia. And out walks this man, Herman Mueninghof. And he walks over to me, and he grabs my hand, and he said, \u201cEddie, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d And I said, \u201cHerman, it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He said, \u201cThe TV people brought me here.\u201d I said, \u201cAll the way https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  85 from Indonesia?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you do there?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m a Catholic bishop, and I live in New Guinea.\u201d I said, \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d He said, \u201cThey wanted me to meet you.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d I said. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to remember that - how we stood guard together that morning. You don\u2019t -- don\u2019t you remember how we - how your mother saved our lives? How your mother, that night, gave me her bicycle, and the flashlight?\u201d And all of a sudden I realized I was wrong.

Why are you stopping me like this?\u201d And the German said, \u201cI know you\u2019re one of these -- these terrorists from the hut.\u201d And Herman said, \u201cWhat hut? I don\u2019t know any hut. What are you talking about?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes, don\u2019t deny it, you\u2019re one of the terrorists from the hut.

Where night school?\u201d He says, \u201cI come from night school in Zeist, and,\u201d -- he said, \u201cWhat are you studying there?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m studying to be a Notary Public,\u201d which was true, Herman was studying to be a Notary Public. And he said -- and he said, \u201cI felt that the guy, what he really wanted, was the little flashlight.\u201d Now this wasn\u2019t an ordinary flashlight, 1t was something that was worth gold in the last -- in -- during the war. It was made by Philips. It was a little hand generator, you squeezed it, and 1t made light. And in a time that there were absolutely no batteries any more, these things were worth gold. People would buy -- pay hundreds of gilders to get one. And the guy wanted this, you know, it was worth something to him. And Herman was very smart, he says, \u201cI thought that if he arrested me, he would have to hand everything over to his superior officer, but if he let me go, he could keep the flashlight. So he -- I said to him, give me the bike, the bike is no good to you, it\u2019s solid tires.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat I -- M-My mother is waiting with dinner, you know.\u201d And he said, \u201cI could see the guy thinking, and then he said, \u201cNah, alza gazie, go.\u201d And he said, \u201cI got on the bike, and I pedaled away.

And in a sense that\u2019s, I guess, what happened to me. And my mother would have certainly approved of it when I s -- when I said that - I promised God that I would try to keep his -- the laws he had given to Moses on Mount Sinai, and in the desert, that I would follow them all my life, if he would just spare my family.

I read about the Jews, and their history, and the battles, and King David, and King Solomon, and all the wonderful stories of the Old Testament, and of my people. But at -- again, as I began to find out what the Holocaust really had -- had been, it all seemed -- religion seemed like a Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  91 farce. God had taken his own people, and murdered one and a half -- let the Germans murder one and a half million of his own children, little children, innocents. It didn\u2019t make any sense. Like so many other Holocaust survivors, I guess, there was no thinking of God after Auschwitz. And so I slowly, slowly left it all. I became -- I read more, and more, and more, and none -- none of it pointed to the existence of -- of God. It all pointed out to the -- to the terrible things that human beings can do. So, religion became not important any more to me. What did become more and more important, though, is the fate of the Jewish people. I am very fervent in my defense of the j -- of the Jewish people, as a most marvelous, marvelous people. Difficult people. Moses knew that already, goes up for a couple of days on the mountains, come back, and they already screwed it up, they made a golden calf. There\u2019s a lesson there. I mean, the J-Jews are difficult, and they are impossible, but they\u2019re also genius, they are the salt of the earth. And to me, the Jewish people in Israel, they\u2019re -- our country, I mean, this is all miraculous, after 2,000 years. Jews have waited for this, and we\u2019ve got a country. And I thank God. We have worked -- We have gone there for five years at least, and given our lives to it. It was well worth it. So, religion is sort of evolved into a fervent nationalism, and -- and a defense of the Jewish people. I will accept no blame whatsoever to Israel, what they do, or whatever they do. It\u2019s -- I\u2019m like the old fashioned English -- Englishman, you know? My country  Or maybe it was an American, I don\u2019t know. I think it was an Englishman who said, my country right or wrong. To me, the -- the security of the Jewish people is uppermost, and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  92 it sounds horrendous, but if it would be necessary to throw every Arab out of -- out of Israel in order to secure it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- the safety of it\u2019s people, I\u2019d say, don\u2019t hesitate, do it. We have suffered for 2,000 years, murder and mayhem. I mean hangings, burnings, it\u2019s horrible, the whole Jewish history is -- is one of -- of -- of suffering. Enough. Now it\u2019s our time. And so, I guess, my religion became really my love for -- for my people. And it\u2019s difficult sometimes you know? I -- We had to -- Carla has two grand -- had a grandnephew here, very nice young man who worked for the Israeli embassy here, and he came with his girlfriend, and they stayed here for three months upstairs in a little room.

We don\u2019t want to know anything about politics, and we don\u2019t want to -- and I think we should give the land back to the -- to the  to the Palestinians, or whoever, and th-the Syrians, and -- and we don\u2019t want to be involved in this.\u201d And I -- These were the people I admire, these are the sabbers, the people who are born there, and I said, \u201cLet me tell you something.

I came out with cousins, I came with uncles, aunts, a whole family. I think that because of that, it is possible for me to go and interview other people, and not go completely to pieces. I think if I had been like the woman who saw her family slaughtered one by one in the Polish forest, I don\u2019t think I could be like -- sitting here, talking with you like this. So -- Then there is something else, this is usually not talked about. There is an intellectual range in Holocaust survivors, as well as non-Holocaust survivors, course. It makes a big difference what -- where you come from, intellectually. If you come from a Polish farming family, a Jewish family, somewhere in a shtetl, where the father was a shoemaker, and the mother did the household, and -- and life was fairly primitive, but wonderful, but then, that\u2019s not my background either. I come from a family, my father was an artist. My mother was a telegraph operator when she -- when - when no women were practically working. I come from a family that loved music, loved literature, loved all the kinds of things. I come from a family where I have one -- two brothers who were college professors, one -- one has changed in the meantime, to be an - a psych -- a psychotherapist. You know, this makes a big difference. I-It\u2019s possible for - for Carla and me, come from a little different group, little different level, to help others. When -- When we go to national conferences, and I see the others, they\u2019re not that many that -- I cried when I saw them the first time, the 1600 hidden children, and I still feel, you know, love for them, but -- but I realize now that not all Holocaust survivors are people that -- that I can -- that I can feel at home with, you know? And it\u2019s interesting in https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  100 many of the interviews that I\u2019ve done, the interviewee said, \u201cEd, we got to get together afterwards, you know. Let\u2019s go out, you and my -- my wife, and -- a-a-and I, and you and your wife, and we\u2019re going to have dinner together.\u201d And I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t do this, not with you.\u201d I mean, very primitive people sometimes. Lovely people, but primitive, I couldn\u2019t -- you know, I couldn\u2019t. There was nothing we had in common, except that I interviewed them. So -- Let\u2019s see, what was the qu -- what was the question? Oh, why do we -- why can we do this, and others cannot? I think it had to do with our background, the fact that we\u2019re not too damaged, and the fact that we came from backgrounds where reading, and -- and -- and culture was of -- of importance. And you\u2019|I find this all over, if you look at the people who, let\u2019s say, are important in -- in the Holocaust community, they\u2019re most -- mostly people who were not that terribly damaged, and who -- who can write, and read, and understand, and so -- or a psychologist, or whatever. I don\u2019t kn -- I - I think -- that is my view of it."

After the conference, in 1981, of the Hidden Children, a letter arrived at my -- my wife\u2019s desk in New York, of the Hidden Children, from a man in Yonkers, his name was Eddie Strauss, have you heard of him? No. Eddie Strauss wrote a letter, and it said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m a hidden child from Belgium, and I\u2019m so terribly sorry I couldn\u2019t come to the conference, because I was in the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  101 hospital, but I would like to take up contact with you.\u201d And Carla came home with this letter, and she handed it to me, and said, \u201cListen, I\u2019m very busy, and this man writes, and he lives right nearby here, about 10 minutes away, in Yonkers. Maybe you can contact him.\u201d Okay. So one day I call -- called up this man, and I got him on the phone, and I - and I said, \u201cAh, Mr. Strauss?\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d I said, \u201cMy wife handed me this letter, could I come and say hello to you?\u201d You know. \u201cYeah, I heard you -- you were sorry you couldn\u2019t come to the conference.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said. So I went down, straight down Broadway, same Broadway you have in New York, and entered a dark apartment, climbed five stairs, five steps up from street level, and entered a dark apartment, and there in the far -- far end of the dark apartment sat a man in a wheelchair, with one leg. I hadn\u2019t expected this. He was overweight, and I shook his hand, and I said, \u201cSo, tell me about yourself.\u201d And out comes this story that he was -- he lived in Antwerp, in Belgium, and he was play -- out playing one day, and he stayed out too late, and when he came back, a neighbor grabbed him from the street, and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go home.\u201d And he found out later that his mother, his grandmother, his three year old sister, and his one year old baby brother had been snatched away from the house that day by -- by the Germans, put in a truck. They were sent to Auschwitz, and the day that they arrived, they were all gassed, all murdered. That was Eddie\u2019s background, and his family. He wound up in an orphan home in -- Belgium had six or seven orphan homes that were set up by the -- by the Judenrat, and with help of the Belgian Queen Mother, and the Germans knew about it. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  102 So these children were really, I say, hostages of the Germans. But they were cared for, and taken care of, and Eddie had been one of them. He had, after the war, he had come to the United States. He -- He went to an uncle of his in Manhattan, and -- and his grandfather lived there, and it didn\u2019t work out. They were German Jews, and they couldn\u2019t understand this boy who had, at one time, been found in the street, totally full of lice, and -- and full of wounds, and -- so Eddie was placed somewhere in New Jersey, with people who were very good for him, and he went to -- he went to college, and he graduated, very smart. Joined the American army -- was drafted into the American army, and of all places was sent to Germany, because he knew fluent German, and he knew French fluently, and English. And he worked for the adjutant general, or something like that, in -- in -- in -- in Munchen, or so-someplace, interviewing Germans to see if they were Nazis, and so on. He came back, and he invented a story about himself, he made an artificial life. The people didn\u2019t know that he was Jewish. He st -- He said that when people asked about his parents, he said they had died in a car accident in Texas, and he had had -- he had a sister somewhere, but also in Texas, and he hadn\u2019t seen her in years, and so on. He told me all this. His name was Eddie, like mine. Our birthdates happened to be the same, the eighth of May. And somehow another, I decided that I would adopt this man. And I began to do what in Jewish we call mitzvahs, good deeds. I got him - first of all, I got him money. I helped him with everything he needed, as much as I could, and he became like a brother to me, and I was his brother, you know, I\u2019m the brother that Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  103 had died. And I took care of him as much as I could, for years. He went -- He had only one leg, he had diabetes, and about a year after I met him, his other leg had to be amputated, so now he had no legs at all, and he wanted to commit suicide, he had tried once to commit suicide. Ha -- But he got a new apartment, a nice, clean apartment, and he had electric wheelchair, which made him very happy. And I gi -- brought him gifts, and I brought him books, and I talked with him, and -- and I took him to Hidden Child meetings in New York, on Purim, or you know. And he was here, we sat in this room with him for Passover, to the seder, we invited him, and brought him with. Lot of trouble, always, getting him with the wheelchair to there -- places. And we took him to Washington, I took him to Washington when the Hidden Children, our group from Westchester, went to the Holocaust museum, he wanted to go there, and you can\u2019t imagine what we went through, took Eddie in the wheelchair to -- to Washington. And February, 1997, he died in front of the computer I had gotten him. He wanted to learn the computer, and he learned, and then he was suddenly dead, and he was gone. And it fell to me to take care of his stuff, little stuff that he had. And it fell to me, about a year ago, to put a -- to take care of his funeral, and then later to put a stone on -- on his grave. And I decided that there was more to him than just -- more to his grave, and there should be more to that grave, and I had a gra -- on the gravestone, I had a stonemason chisel that - something like, in this place -- let this place remember not only Eddie Strauss, whose name was really Abraham Katz, but also his mother, with her name, and his father, and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  104 his sister Esther, and his little one year old brother. I put all their names on there, with the dates, all killed in Auschwitz. So that gravestone is nearby here, and I\u2019m very proud of that, that at least that\u2019s the last thing I could do for Eddie. And I wanted to put that in, it was also a part of my development after the war, as a -- an aware Jew, let me put it that way. End of Tape Four, Side A Conclusion of Interview"
