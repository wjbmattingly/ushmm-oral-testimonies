Interview with Gert Silver :
March 30, 2006
A: Oh yes, I went to a Jewish school in Berlin, and from day one we were taught two
foreign languages, Hebrew and English, and in fact we were forbidden to speak a word of
German during those lessons, was total immersion lesson. And after two or three years, I
was fi -- reasonably fluent in both Hebrew and English. So that’s the time to teach
children foreign languages.
Q: Did you maintain those languages, Hebrew --
A: To a certain extent. I mean, I can still understand simple Hebrew, and English of
course, I -- I knew when I came here.
Q: Tell me about your Jewish day school.
A: I went to a number of Jewish day schools in Berlin. The Jewish schools in Berlin
were just fantastic, when I compare them with the day schools in so -- in -- non-Jewish
day schools in Germany. As the war -- 0-or as Hitler’s power progressed, more and
more Jewish boys and girls who originally went to non-Jewish schools in Germany were
expelled from those schools, and wer -- had to come to our school, they were a year or
two behind us. The standard of education in the Jewish schools in Berlin was just
fantastic.
Q: What was the name of your school?
A: Oh, my first school was in the August Strasse, then I went to the Kaiser Strasse, then
I went to the Gross Hamburger Strasse. Schools closed, or they bombed. So I went to
three different schools in Berlin.

Q: And your siblings attended the same school?
A: Yes.
Q: Were they close to your home?
A: Well, my sister was seven when -- she was born in ’35, so she didn’t go to school at
all. She was four when the war broke out.
Q: Were they close to your home?
A: Yes, oh yes, walking distance.
Q: Your neighborhood, where was that?
A: I lived in a neighborhood that wasn’t -- you wouldn’t call it ex -- exactly a Jewish
neighborhood, but there were a sprinkling of Jews, but most of them, of course, were
non-Jewish.
Q: So you [indecipherable] non-Jewish neighbors?
A: Yes, yeah.
Q: Did you have relationships with them?
A: Not really, I think ma -- almost all of my friends were Jewish, and I had no non-
Jewish friends. And I doubt whether my parents had any non-Jewish friends.
Q: Mm-hm. What were your hobbies as a young boy’?
A: I think I was just a good student. I -- I loved school. Holidays were something that I
abhorred. And I don’t really have -- don’t recall any hobbies I had in those days.
Q: Did you belong to a youth movement?

A: No.
Q: Were there youth movements that you were aware of?
A: Oh yes, there was Maccabee, there was Ha-Koah, there were seven Zionist
organizations. I don’t think I belonged to any of them.
Q: Okay. What about your parents, were they involved [indecipherable]
A: They were involved in the synagogue and I was -- and I sang as a boy 1n the choir of
the biggest synagogue in Berlin, located in the Oranienburger Strasse. It’s a very
famous synagogue with its golden dome, and I sang there as a choirboy. So I went to all
the services. My parents didn’t go, only went to the services on the high holidays.
Q: And you went every week?
A: Yeah, because I was in the choir.
Q: How did you get involved in that?
A: I think they looked for choir boys, the -- the choir looked for boys who were interested
in singing, who were reasonably musical in the Jewish schools, and I volunteered.
Q: So [indecipherable] Friday night and --
A: Friday night, Saturday morning. We often sang at weddings, funerals occasionally. I
have very fond memories of my activity as a choir boy.
Q: Mm-hm. Did you play an instrument as well?
A: I played the recorder and the mouth organ, but very badly, both of them.
Q: Uh-huh, okay. What was the level of religion in your home?

A: I don’t know how you would describe it. Probably similar to the liberals here, and
[indecipherable]. I thi --
Q: The celebration of festivals [indecipherable]
A: Oh yes, oh yes. Well, being in a Jewish school we celebrated Purim, Sukkot, Pesach,
everything.
Q: Mm-hm. Your family, however, belonged to an Orthodox synagogue?
A: No, my family also belonged to that synagogue in the Oranienburger Strasse which
wasn’t exactly -- which wasn't Orthodox at all, nor was it Liberal. It’s probably, if you
compare it to a synagogue in Melbourne, it’s probably like Charnwood Grove, or
Toorak Road.
Q: Mm-hm. What -- what can you remember about any anti-Semitic incidences?
A: I remember a lot of them, I mean we were very often beaten up on walks on our way
to school or from school by Hitler youth. And --
Q: What -- what -- what -- we’re talking after 1933.
A: After 1933, between 733 and ’39.
Q: Who’s we?
A: Well, school kids, friends of mine, when we walked home from school, or when we
walked to school, very often there were mobs of Hitler youth and they just beat us up,
and nobody came to our rescue.
Q: How badly beaten? Can you give me some idea?

Interview with Gert Silver °
March 30, 2006
A: I don’t think we had injuries, but they were painful. We ran away.
Q: Did you fight back?
A: Always that we were outnumbered at all times, and none of the bystanders came to
our help.
Q: How often did this happen?
A: Maybe once or twice a month. I mean, we looked out for them, and if we saw any
Hitler youths in the neighborhood, tried to avoid them, but it wasn’t always possible.
Q: How were they identified as Hitler youth?
A: Oh, they had the uniform.
Q: How old would these boys have been?
A: Probably our age, maybe a little bit older, 10 - 11 - 12. They just did it for fun.
Q: When you say you were outnumbered, what sort of numbers were they?
A: Well very often I walked to school with two friends, and very often there was a dozen
of them. So we had very little hope.
Q: Did you report them to anybody?
A: We reported to that school, but the school couldn’t do much either. When it happened
occa -- more frequently than at other times, our parents, or one of our parents walked
with us to school, and that provided protection. They didn’t attack anybody who was
accompanied by an adult.
Q: Did it happen to girls as well?

Interview with Gert Silver "
March 30, 2006
A: I don’t know. I don’t know the answer to that question.
Q: Mm-hm. Did you see them often in the street, even if they weren’t involved in --
A: Oh [indecipherable] Hitler youth all the time. I mean, it was a government -- it was
Hitler’s youth movement. They were proud to show their uniforms, so it was part of the
day to day scenery in Berlin.
Q: What did it mean to you at that age, as a young boy”?
A: The enemy.
Q: So how did that make you feel about your home?
A: I don’t know how to answer that question. I -- I felt terribly uncomfortable and fearful
at times. It wasn’t a very pleasant experience to grow up in Berlin after Hitler came to
power.
Q: How did your parents deal with it?
A: They were equally apprehensive, and to this day I will never know why my parents
didn’t leave Germany. I mean, if I read the literature today of how Jews were treated in
the immediate pre-Hitler period, and after Hitler came to power, it was relatively easy to
leave Germany. Why my parents didn’t leave, I will never know, but they were not
alone, I mean, there were possibly a hundred thousand Jews 1n-in -- in Germany, maybe
even more, who stayed in Germany. Many of them thought that Hitler would never
attack the German Jews.
Q: Do you know people that left Germany at that time?

Interview with Gert Silver "
March 30, 2006
A: Oh, many of them, I -- many of them here in Melbourne.
Q: Friends of yours?
A: Yes. Yes, if I ha -- the signals were so clear, right from 1933 when Hitler came to
power, but there was go -- there were going to be enormous problems. And why my
parents didn’t leave, I will never know. I mean, it wasn’t always easy, reading the
literature now, to get permits to emigrate -- or to immigrate, rather. To emigrate was
relatively easy in the early years of Hitler. But to get permits to America, to Australia,
to some of the other countries, was relatively difficult. I think the only country that
admitted Jews in unlimited numbers was Shanghai, and | think the Dominican
Republic.
Q: So the people that you knew that were leaving, where were they going to?
A: Some of them went to England, some of them went to France and were later caught
in France during the war. Many of them went to America, my aunt emigrated to Chile.
Q: In what year?
A: Either ’37 or ’38. My uncle emigrated to Shanghai, and survived the war in
Shanghai, returned to Berlin at the end of the war and died there. So --
Q: Natural causes?
A: Yes, yeah. So it was possible to leave Germany, but my parents, like so many others,
obviously totally underestimated the consequences.
Q: What -- what comment can you make about your standard of living in Germany”?

Interview with Gert Silver "
March 30, 2006
A: We got progressively poorer. I think we were middle class when I was a child, and as
the -- as the economical strains on Jews became increasingly difficult, I think our
standard of living became lower. And of course, from ’39 on, all food was rationed, with
a special ration card for Jews, and we got significantly less food than --
Q: We’ll come to that later.
A: Yeah, sure.
Q: So what changes took place? You said you got progressively poorer. What -- what --
what do you remember changing --
A: We moved to, I think lower class residences, lower class districts.
Q: With your household?
A: Yeah. Well, we didn’t live in a house, we always lived in apartments.
Q: Was that your apartment, or rented?
A: All rented, we rented, I think. I’m almost certain it was rented. And that was basically
it. I-I know we became poorer, although parents normally don’t discuss their financial
affairs with their teenagers, their -- with their 10 or 11 year olds.
Q: So [indecipherable]
A: But don’t forget I was 11 when the -- when the war started, I was four when Hitler
came to power.
Q: So where did you move to?

A: To the last residence that I’ve shown in that [indecipherable] in a district in Berlin
called Weding, of all places. And we moved there, and that -- it was from there that I was
deported.
Q: What happened with school?
A: Well, di -- the school was closed in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II.
Q: Until ’39, you were at school?
A: Yes.
Q: Wi -- were you aware of things changing in your education with Hitler’s rise to
power?
A: No, not really. I think the education was -- was unchanged.
Q: Mm-hm. What about on weekends, did you have the freedom to --
A: Oh yes, I mean, I was free in Berlin until ’43.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: We had to wear the yellow star.
Q: From what year?
A: I think from 1941, either ’41 or ’42.

Interview with Gert Silver "
March 30, 2006
A: I don’t think any.
Q: Increased incidences in anti-Semitism, increased --
A: Well, as I told you, the -- the mob of the Hitler youth on our way to school and from
school. Apart from that, no, not really. I mean, there were places where Jews couldn’t go
to.
Q: Like where?
A: Parks, primarily. Picture theaters and other venues, but primarily picture theaters and
parks. There were even benches that -- where it was written, Jews are not allowed to sit
here.
Q: And the picture theaters of that time?
A: We’re just not allowed to go.
Q: Do you remember how that affected you at the time?
A: I don’t think it bothered me a great deal, as far as I remember.
Q: Do you remember the effect it had on your parents?
A: I don’t know. I’m sure they suffered, but they didn’t show it.
Q: Mm-hm. What was the atmosphere like in your home?
A: Really it’s too -- I think to a very large extent, unchanged. I di -- don’t think I
remember any changes. My parents, I think, tried to shelter the children from everything
bad. So they shielded us, I think from many things that they must have been aware of.

A: Oh sure, dirty Jew, and that -- that kind of thing. I mean, that happened even when --
after we wore the star and we walked in the street, people out of the blue yelled at us,
dirty Jew.
Q: So what happened, as you remember it, before the war began, and as it began in 1939
September?
A: What period?
Q: What -- what happened just before ’39?
A: Well, I had -- I had a normal life, I went to school from 1934 to 1939.
Q: Mm. What happened in *39?
A: Well, in ’39 when the war broke out, the Jewish schools were closed, and I had to stay
at home.
Q: Do you remember the day you were told not to come to school?
A: No. I think my parents just told me school 1s finished, school is closed. But I kept up
my contact with my Jewish friends, and in fact, I was Bar Mitzvah in Berlin in 1941,
two years after the outbreak of World War II. So there was a Jewish life in Berlin.
Q: Where did you celebrate your Bar Mitzvah?
A: Ina synagogue called [indecipherable] in the Oranienburger Strasse
[indecipherable] existed, was bombed by the allies and I had joined a choir in that
particular synagogue.
Q: Mm-hm.

A: There were services in the synagogues in Berlin until ’43. Many synagogues were
closed, but some were opened.
Q: You said your -- the synagogue that you belonged to was bombed.
A: Yes.
Q: Was that of any s -- did you see it --
A: I didn’t see it, but -- but I didn’t see it while it was being bombed, because during the
air raids, we were not allowed to go out. We had to go to -- either to air raid shelters, or
stay where we were. But afterwards, in the next morning, I was told, I don’t know by
whom, maybe -- maybe by my parents, maybe my friends, that synagogue has been
bombed. And then I walked there -- it wasn’t a very long walk from home, and saw the
damage.
Q: What was the damage? Was the whole building --
A: Was -- was the -- was the -- 1t was still smoking, and there was very little left of the
synagogue. [indecipherable] the synagogue where I was Bar Mitzvahed.
Q: Was there a celebration after the service?
A: I think 1t was a family reunion, and friends.
Q: Mm-hm. Her -- tell me about the air raid.
A: Well, there were air raids almost from the beginning of ’39 from planes from
England. There were sirens when -- if they approached Berlin. And then initially, I think
in the early years of the war, we were compelled li -- just like the non-Jews, to go to air

raid shelters. Subsequently, we were not allowed to go to air raid shelters any more, we
stayed at home.
Q: How often?
A: Hm?
Q: How often was there an air raid?
A: How often the air raids? I don’t remember, they were very often, and they increased in
frequency as the war progressed.
Q: Do you remember the impact it had on you at that time?
A: You became immune to it. I don’t think it had any special impact on me.
Q: Your parents?
A: If it did have an impact on them, they didn’t show it.
Q: They -- after an air raid, you would go out of the house the next morning and see --
A: And look -- look at the damage.
Q: -- more devastation.
A: Look at the damage. See what houses in the neighborhood were attacked. That’s what
we did the next day. Not all the air raids occurred during the night, some of them
occurred during the day in -- in broad daylight. And they often lasted for an hour or two
or three, and we went and observed the damage as soon as we were allowed to leave.
Q: Were the streets full of people out looking to see what had happened?
A: Yeah.

March 30, 2006
Q: What were you doing on the day, every day, not going to school?
A: I stayed at home and visited friends, and read a lot.
Q: What sort of things did you read?
A: Everything I could lay my hands on. I borrowed books from the library, from the
Jewish library. We had quite a -- rather extensive library at home.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And that was [indecipherable] I did a lot of that. My parents from time to time, kept
on teaching me arithmetic, geography, and a few other things that they thought I should
know.
Q: Up until what time was your father working in his business?
A: When we were deported in 1943, only my mother, my sister and I were deported, my
father was not at home. And I thought, in fact, that he had survived the war, because I
didn’t know what happened to him. And immediately after the war, after liberation, I
went back to Berlin in the hopes that he had survived underground, only to be informed
then, in October ’44, six months before my liberation, he was discovered by the Gestapo,
sent to Auschwitz, and he died there. So he certainly worked when we were deported.
How much longer he worked there -- I presume he stopped work immediately and went
underground, because when the Gestapo deported a family, they put a seal on the door.
And when my father came home in the evening, he would have seen that seal, he would
have known what happened, and I presume he went underground, but I’ll never know.

March 30, 2006
Q: Mm-hm. What was the food situation up until the time of deportation?
A: Not very good. We got no butter, only margarine. Very little fruit, very little sugar, if
any. No chocolate, no more goodies. And that was basically the rations. I mean germ --
ordinary Germans also had ration coupons, but the ration for Jews were significantly
lower than for the ordinary population.
Q: Did you feel hungry at that time?
A: I don’t think I ever experienced hunger, no. No, my mother was a good cook, and one
way or another she always managed t-to prepare good meals. We had some friends, I
think they must have been non-Jewish, I didn’t really know them, friends of my parents,
who occasionally supplemented our rations with a bit of butter and a bit of meat and
some eggs. I mean, there was a large black market, and it’s quite possible that my parents
bought some food on the black market.
Q: So your family life, until °43, until the time of deportation was every evening you
were all home together.
A: Yeah.
Q: And everybody went their own way during the day.
A: Yes.
Q: What was your mother doing?

42 -- no, mid-’42, she went to work in a -- also for Siemens, oddly enough. I think it was

forced labor, because there were so many people on the front that the German factories,
they came to get any labor that they could. And I think she worked on the assembly line
there. So she went to work every morning.
Q: Was that her choice, or she --
A: Oh no, no, I’m sure it wasn’t her choice, I’m sure she was compel -- I’m sure it was
forced labor.
Q: Mm-hm. Were you aware about the deportations until --
A: Yes, very much so because every time I went to s -- not deportation actually, not -- I
was more aware of emigration. I was not aware of deportations at all. But every day I
went to school, and there were one or two students not there any more.
Q: This was bef -- this is earlier?
A: Yeah, this was before the war -- before the war, who had emigrated. But of
deportations I was totally unaware.
Q: What can you say about your neighbors, your German non-Jewish neighbors?
A: I think they avoided us, is probably the best way to express it. None of them were
sympathetic or anything. I think they just avoided us.
Q: You don’t remember anybody offering you assistance, except --
A: No, no.
Q: -- for this food that you were given, you don’t know who gave it to you, the extra
food.

A: I think it was either ’41 or ’42, I mean that -- that date 1s fairly well documented.
Q: Yes.
A: It -- 1t became a decree, you had to go somewhere to pick it up.
Q: Do you remember the day you went to pick it up? Do you remember the actual --
A: My parents picked it up, I didn’t pick it up. And then they had to sew it on the left
hand side on your jacket, or on the outer garment that you wore.
Q: Did your mother sew it on for you?
A: Yeah.

Q: Do you remember that?
A: Very vaguely.
Q: What did she sew it onto?
A: Onto a jumper, onto a shirt, onto a jacket, depending on the season.
Q: In your -- in your case, what was -- oh, I see, it changed?
A: Yes, sure, because they -- it had to be shown on whatever your outer garment was. So
in summer it was just a shirt, in winter it was a jumper or -- or a jacket.
Q: Was that significant for you to wear that?
A: I don’t know how to answer that question whether it was significant [indecipherable]
but it was a matter of fact. I had to wear it and that was it. It didn’t cause particular
trauma as far as I remember.
Q: What other comments can you make about walking in the street, until the time that
you were deported, up until ’43?
A: I don’t think I can add to anything I told you.
Q: Did you see any other beatings?
A: Not that I remember.
Q: Did you see Jewish businesses or shops closed?
A: All I remember, 1938, the Kristallnacht --

anything that was happening elsewhere, your --

stayed there, certainly for several weeks, if not for a couple of months, I don’t remember

Q: How were you treated?
A: Reasonably well. I mean, we didn’t go out, we were not allowed out. Nobody beat us
up. We were -- we just did very little.
Q: So you were there for a couple of weeks?

Q: Couple of months. And then what happened?
A: Then another furniture van came, took us to a railway station, and from there we had
to go into a wagon where there were lots of other people, and then we were deported to
Auschwitz, actually to one of the camps, that they called hausenlager, auxiliary camps
near Auschwitz, called Buna, B-u-n-a. But the -- the -- the trip was awful, and one of the
most traumatic experiences of all the war, because we were -- we were so many people, it
was just like a suburban train at peak hour, was standing room only. There were people
there of all ages, from old people to children as young as we were and even younger. We
were perched in there, it was dreadful.

ever seen the subways in Japan where they have pushers to push people in. That’s what
it was like.
Q: So what happened when someone died?
A: Wherever he is -- I think they were probably put in a corner somewhere. I mean, not
many died, perhaps three, or four, or five.

A: Not to my knowledge.
Q: So you arrived in -- in -- did you s -- how did you know you were in Auschwitz?
A: I -- I found out later. I didn’t know where I was when we -- when we disembarked.
But I found out fairly soon afterwards where I was. When we arrived, we were asked to
leave the wagons. There was an SS man on a podium and they said women and children
to the left, and men to the right. And I instinctively held onto my mother and joined her
and my sister to women -- to the left where the women and the children were. And then
my mother pushed me to the men. So I think she really gave birth to be twice. Once in
°28, once in °43. My sister and my mother went straight to the gas chambers.

lice.

Lysol or something. Some chemical. They were worried about the health of the Germans

German. And in Auschwitz, I was sent to a Maurerschule, a bricklayer’s school. They
wanted to train us as bricklayers to build more factories and build more barracks. And
that was an activity that was a lot easier than carrying cement bags and carrying rods, so I
became a bricklayer in Auschwitz.

A: There was no way of dealing with it except experiencing it, and that was -- nothing
you could do. If you’re hungry you probably get yourself something to eat, couldn’t get
anything there. You trade food occasionally because we were given a ration of tobacco,
which was called [indecipherable], was a horrible -- anyway, since I didn't smoke, I
traded it with smokers for an extra piece of bread.
Q: Did you ration that piece of bread, or you ate it?
A: I tried and ate it as I could because if I kept it for the next -- until the next morning,
maybe it would be stolen overnight. We had some very skillful thieves in the camp. So
was always good to eat it and not keep it.
Q: There was no way of getting extra food from somewhere, other than that? You didn't
know anybody that worked in a kitchen that might have had access?
A: No. I know that some prisoners did know people who were in the kitchen, I -- I didn’t.
Q: Mm-hm. Did you feel that it was lucky to get this bricklaying job, for any reason?
A: Well it was certainly a lot better than Buna. Buna was awful. This was a lot easier.
Q: The work was harder?
A: Yes, yes.
Q: Much harder.
A: The living conditions were the same as in Buna.
Q: Bigger?

A: No, it was -- well, the camp was bigger, but the barracks and the working hours, and
the -- and all that, were just like in Buna.
Q: Was there any heating, any fire to get warm?
A: No.
Q: So nighttime was cold, going to be cold.
A: Yeah, yeah. But di -- you fell asleep, you were exhausted.
Q: Do you remember the people that you shared a bunk with in Auschwitz?
A: I don’t remember any of them personally. The worst part of it is 1f you had to get up in
the middle of the night to relieve your bladder, then you became aware of how cold it
really was.
Q: Mm-hm. You had to go out of the barrack?
A: No, you had to stay in the barrack, except that when the container was full, you had to
go out and empty it.
Q: The container?
A: Of urine, where everybody emptied their bladder.
Q: And was that the only bathroom facility?
A: Yeah.
Q: There was no place to wash your face, wash clothes?
A: Oh, not -- not to wash clothes, but ye -- yet there were facilities to wash your face,
your hands, sure.

Q: Do you have any memories of the kapos, how they treated you?
A: They were not very nice, but I tried to have as little as possible to do with them.
Q: Why do you say they were not nice? You must have seen something.
A: They screamed at people, they hit people. I wanted to avoid them as much as I could.
Q: And it was easy to avoid them?
A: I guess so. I mean, I successfully avoided them just about all the time.
Q: And what about the SS that was supervising the work? Did you avoid them also?
A: Yes.
Q: You didn’t get into [indecipherable]
A: I tried not to attract attention. It was the worst thing you could do.
Q: Mm-hm. Did you see other people attracting attention?
A: Some people collapsed, some people didn’t work fast enough. I tried to be as
unobtrusive as I could.
Q: Did you form any friendships?
A: Friendship’s probably too strong an expression.
Q: Connection.
A: Connections.
Q: Just people you discuss things with.

A: I don’t remember, to tell you the truth.
Q: So you weren't ever beaten in the camps?
A: I was hit occasionally, but not really -- not, not often.
Q: What were you hit with?
A: A wooden -- I think a rifle butt.
Q: Do you remember why you were hit?
A: I don’t know why I hit, but I still have marks of it today. I’m totally deaf on my right
ear as a result of being hit over the head. It was the only memory of it.
Q: And was that instant?
A: The deafness?
Q: When did you lose your hearing? Yeah.
A: The deafness I think was instant. Luckily I’ve got good hearing on the left ear, so that
you didn’t notice that I’m half deaf.
Q: Mm-hm. And was there appelle in ausch --
A: Every morning.
Q: Can you explain that?
A: Oh, that was a ro -- a roll call, and we had to go out and the SS counted to make sure
that nobody had died, stayed in the barracks, or fled, which was very rare. But some
people died overnight, and the numbers had to match.
Q: How long did the appelle take?

hour or two.
Q: And where was that held?
A: Outside the barracks.
Q: Every day?
A: Every morning, every evening.
Q: Were you counted again when you returned from work?
A: Yes.
Q: Also in a -- in appelle?
A: Yeah.
Q: And so what -- what evolved if there -- if there was somebody that had died
overnight?
A: Then they went to the barracks to see if there was somebody in the barracks who co-
couldn’t or wouldn’t come to the appelle. Th-They -- the appelle did not end until the
discrepancy was discovered, whether it took half an hour, or an hour, two.
Q: Who conducted it?
A: The SS.
Q: So the role of the kapo was inside the barrack?
A: Inside the barracks and occasionally also at work.

March 30, 2006
A: I wasn’t aware, but I knew that some people escaped, and some of them were caught,
and they were publicly hanged.
Q: From Auschwitz?
A: In front of everybody. And all of us had to look --
Q: [indecipherable]
A: -- and observe -- we had to.
Q: When -- where it was public, where was it held, the hanging?
A: Probably at the place where they look -- where the appelle was held.
Q: Did -- you said you saw it?
A: Yes.
Q: How many people were hung that you saw?
A: Sometimes as many as six or eight, I think, sometimes one or two. And the SS
watched that you didn’t close your eyes. But somehow one develops a talent to look past
it, look -- to have your eyes open in the direction but not to see it.
Q: Were they people that you knew?
A: No, not to my knowledge.
Q: During the day working, did you talk to people?
A: Whilst -- whilst -- we had our lunch, we talked to people. And also, if you work with
others, you can talk to them.

A: I mean, there were -- I wasn’t the only bricklayer, there were many of us. And sure,
you cou -- you could talk to the others.
Q: Are you aware of any resistance of any kind --
A: No.
Q: -- in Auschwitz?
A: No, not at all.
Q: Had you heard of resistance outside of the camp?
A: No. I was too young. I wasn’t a man then, I was a child.
Q: It’s a -- it’s an unusual question, but what comment can you make about the SS in that
circumstance in Auschwitz?
A: Some of the SS were German, some were Austrians, some were Ukrainians. The worst
were the Ukrainians, the second worst were the Austrians, and if you can use the word
best, were the Germans. If you were surrounded by German SS, you had a fairly good
chance to get back to work -- back to the camp in the evening. If the SS in charge of you
were either Ukrainian or Croatian or Austrian, the chances were greatly diminished.
Q: Did you encounter Ukrainian SS?
A: Yes.
Q: Where?
A: At Auschwitz. I mean, the SS -- was a different SS very often, from one day to the
next.

A: But you could tell very quickly where they came from.
Q: Not only by their accents, but they --
A: By -- by the -- by their accent, by their treatment.
Q: Are you able to clarify why they -- why their treatment was worse?
A: I think the -- I think the Austrians are more anti-Semitic than the Germans. I think the
Croatians -- I mean, if they joined the SS, maybe they wanted to prove something, I don’t
know. But every day you had a German SS, it was good news.
Q: Mm-hm. The language that you used in Auschwitz --
A: German.
Q: -- only German?
A: German.
Q: All the time, just German?
A: All the time, yeah.
Q: Did you think that every day could be your last day?
A: Yeah, every day. Every day. At least when I was in Auschwitz. In Bobrick the
situation was totally different. But I also had some lucky breaks. One day in the morning
at the appelle, the SS in charge of the appelle asked, is there anybody who can speak
fluent German and Hebrew? I could not for the life of me understand why the SS would
ask that question, but at that time I spoke reasonably fluent Hebrew. And so I put my arm

up, and also one or two of my colleagues from -- who were at school with me, also put
their arm up. The others went to work and we were kept there, and we found out why
they wanted us. It was the time that the Jews from Saloniki in Greece arrived in
Auschwitz. And those -- the Jews from Saloniki only spoke Greek and Hebrew. They
needed to be interviewed, they needed interpreters. What their name was, when they were
born, what traits, what professions they had. So they needed somebody who could ask
them in Hebrew and translate it into German. So I had a soft job for -- for simply a month
or six weeks. That was one lucky break I had.
Q: Where was that [indecipherable]
A: In Auschwitz, in an office, inside.
Q: Was the food different?
A: To tell you the truth, I don’t remember. It was definitely not worse.
Q: Were you working long hours, or shorter hours?
A: Sometimes we di -- we just sat to arrive -- to await the arrival of a transport. We had a
chair. There were no chairs in Auschwitz. So that was one of the lucky breaks I had in
Auschwitz. The lucky break. And then the other lucky break was when I left Auschwitz
and came to Bobrick.
Q: Pll ask you that in a moment.
A: Yeah.
Q: The people that arrived from Saloniki and Greece, did you say?

March 30, 2006
A: Yeah.
Q: Did they inform you about anything that -- that you hadn’t known before?
A: No, but it -- what it enabled us to do is to save some lives, because we knew that if
somebody was asked the question, what was his profession, that he said I’m a violinist, or
I’m a teacher, he would probably be sent to the gas chambers. Somebody was a carpenter,
or a locksmith, or a bricklayer, or a welder, they were safe. So very often, a lot of the
Saloniki Jews told us that they’re a teacher or a violinist, we translated it as a welder, or
as a bricklayer, or as a laborer.
Q: With their knowledge or not?
A: Not with their knowledge, and not with the SS knowledge. Because they didn't
understand the Germans and the Germans didn’t understand Hebrew.
Q: Do you ever remember communicating to them in Hebrew --
A: Yes, of course.
Q: -- and telling them something that [indecipherable]
A: No, I didn't tell them anything, I just asked them what their name was, how old they
were, where they were born, when and what their profession was. So my knowledge of
Hebrew, you could almost argue, saved my life.
Q: Was this towards the end of your stay in -- in Auschwitz?
A: No, it was more or less at the beginning.
Q: So after a whole month there were Jews being brought into Auschwitz from --

A: Yeah.
Q: -- Saloniki and Greece.
A: Yeah. Well, Saloniki is a city in Greece, and th-there was a large Jewish population.
So we were all rounded up and all brought together within days.
Q: Would you be aware of numbers, how many were brought in?
A: I was just sorry that it ended, and I go back to become a bricklayer.
Q: So you were in Auschwitz altogether for about a year?
A: Yeah, yes.
Q: Which -- did you ever have any contact with women in Auschwitz?
A: No, none at all.
Q: Were you aware of any behavior of the SS outside of the camps at night? Any brothels
in Auschwitz?
A: There were brothels in Auschwitz, and I believe that some prisoners, kapos, were also
allowed to go to the brothels from time to time. But at my age, I wasn't interested.
Q: Did you know where they were?
A: Yeah, I -- I saw them from outside. I --
Q: But you never fol --

A: No, because the brickwork was finished long before the -- the interior was done. We
basically built the shells.
Q: How many shells were you involved in?
A: Two, three, four, I don’t remember.
Q: Mm-hm. Were you aware of the gas chambers in location?
A: I was aware of their existence, and I was -- I knew where they were, but only from
being told by others. I personally did not see any.
Q: You didn’t see chimneys?
A: No.
Q: Could you smell anything from the gas chambers?
A: I don’t remember. The gas chamber 1s mainly in a place called Birkenau, and I was
never in Birkenau.
Q: So after you were in Auschwitz, what happened?
A: Then there was another roll call, and they were asking for young men who could
speak German and who could re -- who could read technical drawings. Again, I didn't
know why, but I put my hand up. And -- because we had done geometry at school. And
by -- when the others, I think, went to work, we were taken to a place called Bobrick,
which was a very small camp, maybe 150 - 200 people, not very far from Auschwitz, but
run by civilians [indecipherable] Siemens. And the treatment was significantly better
than in Auschwitz.

already taken place, and the wa -- they needed to train toolmakers, and all the toolmakers
were on the front. So we were trained as toolmakers. We weren't beaten, food was better,
the accommodation was better.
Q: The quantity of food?
A: The quantities were better. I think the quality of the food was better. Nobody was
beaten, nobody was threatened. They want to teach us.
Q: Civilians from where?
A: From Siemens.

A: Well, we were supposed to be -- to be trained as toolmakers, and toolmakers
manufacture a variety of tools.
Q: What sort of tools?
A: Tools to manufacture ammunition, tools to manufacture plumbing equipment, tools to
make all sorts of metal objects. So we got lessons in geometry. We were given tools,
rasps, files, drills. We were given pieces of metal to drill out triangles, rectangles and so
on. That’s what it -- that -- that didn’t train us enough that we were [indecipherable]
toolmaker. An apprenticeship as a toolmaker is many years, and I think I was in Bobrick
probably for a period of eight or nine months.
Q: Who else volunteered with you from Auschwitz?
A: Some -- some of the young -- you needed to speak German, that was one of the pre-
requisites, because the teachers only spoke German. So that was one pre-requisite. And
you needed to have a -- an elementary or rudimentary knowledge of geometry, triangles,
squares. That’s al -- I had that.
Q: So how many of you from Auschwitz came over to Bobrick?
A: Probably 15 or 20.
Q: Your friends from school, did they come too?
A: Yes, and others, yeah.
Q: How were you transported from Auschwitz?

A: For the same reason that I volunteered when I was asked whether I speak Hebrew and
German.
Q: What do you think prompted you?
A: Maybe the hope for betterment.
Q: The accommodation at Bobrick, was it --
A: Was better.
Q: Better?
A: Better.
Q: In what way”?
A: First of all, there were not so many of us, I mean, it was a small camp. There were 10
or 20 in one barrack. It was a lot better than a hundred or 200. And the hygienic facilities
were better. There were toilets -- at Auschwitz there were no toilets, just empty land.

the civilian Germans. The SS were there to -- I guess to stop people from fleeing,
absconding. But they were on the outside, they didn’t take much interest in us.

a bit more.
Q: Did you stop at any stage?
A: Yeah. Yeah, we stopped occasionally, but by and large we walked. 50 kilometers.
Q: Was that traumatic?

Q: Wh-When you tra -- on your way to Buchenwald, you traveled through
Czechoslovakia.
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you have any contact with --
A: It was one of the very pleasant experiences because for one reason or another, the
opened wagons stopped in Prague under a bridge and some Czechs threw food parcels
into the open wagons. And the SS who saw that, chased them away and wanted to stop
them from doing it, so the SS chased them from left to right, they came back on the other
side and kept putting -- throwing food parcels and food into the open wagons. I'll never
forget that. Ordinary, civilian Czechs.
Q: How long did -- so the train stopped under a bridge?
A: Under a bridge, maybe for an hour or two and I don’t know why it stopped there, just
happened to stop there.
Q: So Buchenwald, what was the atmosphere in Buchenwald compared to the other
places?
A: Well, we knew that the end of the war wasn’t too far away.
Q: How did you know?
A: We were told by fellow prisoners who had access to information that I didn’t have.
And we were told, just last a little bit longer and you will be alright. So we tried to
survive.

very bad state. And I had typhus, but I survived it. I overcame it.
Q: Had you been sick before that?

A: They asked if we were hungry. It’s a silly question. So they took us to some of their
PX depots outside Buchenwald. That’s where the -- the American soldiers were fed.
And, you pick what you like. So I, like many of us, we ate butter by the spoonful, and
washed it down with sweetened, condensed milk. That’s when I got really sick.
Q: Why did you choose that?
A: My body obviously needed it. I need fat, I needed sugar. That’s when I really got sick.

Q: Where were you then?
A: In Buchenwald.
Q: You stayed in the camp?
A: Stayed in the camp until after the war was over, because we were liberated one month
before the war was over, and then shortly after that I went to Berlin because I had hope
that my father had survived. Didn’t take me long to find out that he hadn’t. Then I went
back to Buchenwald. I didn’t really know what to do, I had no relative. I was 16 going

But I was unsuccessful. Today I am grateful for it.

A: I don’t know, I think it then was a question of having the right connections, and
having perhaps more perseverance than I did. Trying harder than I did. But, I mean not
many, maybe half a dozen at the most. One of the boys with whom I was in the camp
went to Israel, became very successful in Israel, and then acquired skills that several
years later were in short supply, and Switzerland -- was able to get back to Switzerland
to get a working permit, and today is a Swiss citizen of immense wealth.

technician, he trained as a watchmaker, and as watches became electronic, there was no

else, I think either to repair typewriters or to repair something, I’m not quite sure. O-
Optical instruments. He’s a very clever boy. Boy, he’s my age. And that skill was in short
supply in Switzerland, that’s why he applied to the Swiss government for permission to
go back to Switzerland. And he got a job in Switzerland, then established his own
manufacturing industry there. I saw him just three months ago in Switzerland.

Q: This is a continuation of Gert Silver’s oral testimony at the Melbourne Holocaust
Museum. Could you continue by telling us about your working life as a dental
technician?
A: Well, I actually only worked as a dental technician for a period of three months. It so
happened that when the night course was completed, the person, a Mr. Schubert who ran
the course, left Geneva to return to France. And as they didn’t have an immediate
replacement for him, they appointed me to run the course for the next generation of
intakes, on a temporary basis. So I worked there for three months, and then a replacement
was found. After that, by sheer coincidence, I found a position in a Swiss export/import
firm, owned by a Geneva -- a Jewish man called smi -- Michael Smeedof, and he wanted
me because I spoke Spanish. The reason why I spoke Spanish, I had to learn Spanish in
Switzerland because I had originally intended to emigrate to Chile. And he needed
somebody who could speak Spanish, and because he couldn’t find anybody else, he got a
working permit for me, which wasn’t easy. And I enjoyed that position thoroughly. It
really opened my eyes, and I saw there was more to life than fixing people’s false teeth.

working permit for me. And I worked there, I think probably for six or eight months.
Then my working permit expired, and they found a Swiss replacement for me. That Swiss
replacement was a young woman from Bern [indecipherable], and I had to train her
before I left the position. We got on so much -- so well with each other, that we ended up
getting married in October °49, and she’s still my wife today after 56 years. I then left
Geneva --
Q: You married in Switzerland?
A: Ye-Yeah, not -- not straight away. I then left Switzerland for Marseilles, because the
consulate found me a position at the -- at the consulate in Marseilles from where many of
the emigrants embarked for Israel. I worked there maybe six, maybe nine months, I don’t
remember exactly. Then I returned to Geneva, and in ’49 we got married in Geneva.

Q: Can you give us some details about your wedding ceremony and celebration?
A: It was a -- it was a ceremony held in the Grande Synagogue de Geneva, a big
synagogue in Geneva. It was very emotional. Many of my friends were there. I had no
family, but very many family members of my wife, who had come from Bern. And --
Q: Where was your wife during the war?
A: Beg your pardon?
Q: Where was your wife during the war?
A: Oh, she is Swiss, she was born in Switzerland, and she -- she stayed in Switzerland
all her life.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And she’s a Swiss citizen. And then --
Q: Can you explain what you meant by it was very emotional?
A: Oh, I can’t tell you. I think [indecipherable] and it was probably just a -- a normal,
pleasant ceremony by the [indecipherable] de Geneva, a man named Saffron, who
passed away only a few years ago. And after that, something eventful happened. The
brother of an uncle of mine had survived as a Jew in Berlin, and he invited my wife and
me to spend our honeymoon in Berlin. So we traveled t-to Berlin --
Q: When did you make contact with the man?
A: Long before ’49, I found him.
Q: How did you find him?

A: How did I find him, well I had found my aunt in Chile, and her first husband had
survived the war in Shanghai, and returned to Berlin after the end of the war. And my
aunt told my uncle in Berlin who I was and where I was. So we made contact with each
other.
Q: He -- who contacted who?
A: I don’t remember.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: I don’t remember. So anyway, we spent our honeymoon in Berlin, and I walked
around with my wife for hours, showing her where I was born, where I went to school,
where the synagogue was where I sang as a -- and also one day we went for a walk and I
showed her where an aunt of mine had her hairdressing salon before the war. And as we
stood there, two German women came and asked us is there anything we’re looking for.
So I told her, yes, before the war, my aunt had a hairdressing salon here. And they said,
she’s living on the second floor. That was unbelievable. So we walked up.
Q: What -- what -- what was her name?
A: Paula Hakker.
Q: And how was she your aunt?
A: She was married to my mother’s brother.
Q: Mm-hm. Did you have much to do with her before the war?

daughters.

A: A week, I think. Then I went back to Geneva, and I brought my cousin Vera to
Switzerland. She then got married in Switzerland, to a man called [indecipherable]

Q: What had happened to her husband?

who invited us to have our honeymoon in Berlin, he was married also to a non-Jewish
German woman, and he survived. And I don’t know whether the name Rosenstrasse
means anything to you. The last Jews to be deported from Berlin were those married to
non-Jewish women. And they were all one day rounded up and put into a building that
was located in the Rosenstrasse, and the -- their German wives arri -- assembled 1n front
of the headquarters of that establishment and protested day and night, day and night, to
release their husband. And in the event -- in the end, the Gestapo gave -- g-gave in and

mostly on business, and partly to visit my uncle until he passed away. I don’t -- I feel
terribly uncomfortable in Germany to this day.
Q: Why’?
A: Because of what happened to my family and to me. I mean, I get a pension from the
German government, and every year I have to go to the German consulate here to make
sure -- because I’m under certificate of life, that I’m still alive, and I dread that
experience. I get it over with as fast as I can.

Yvonne, who was a young girl then. And we got on very well with each other, and they
suggested, why don’t you come to Australia, seeing that you can’t stay in Switzerland
forever? And the idea appealed to us, and we decided there and then to apply for a
landing permit to emigrate to Australia. We got it finally, and --

were -- spent time with each other, we didn’t make many friends. Acquaintances perhaps,
not friends.
Q: All refugees --
A: Yes.
Q: -- emigrating to Australia?
A: Mm. Before I left, I visited a man named Jack Salmonovitz in Geneva, whom I had
met during my stay there. He was probably at that time the wealthiest Jew in the whole of
Switzerland, and the owner of a very large multi-national firm, with offices among -- in
just about every port in the world including Melbourne. I visited him and told him that I
was going to Australia, to Melbourne, and if he had a position there for me, I’d be very
interested perhaps to join his firm. So he gave me a letter of introduction to the
Melbourne office, and I was engaged on the spot there and then. So I had a job within
days of arriving here. And I worked there from 1950 to 1958.
Q: What was the name of the company?
A: The -- the English name was called General Superintendents Company. The French
name -- and it was a firm from Geneva, was called, Societe Generale de
[indecipherable]. It’s a huge firm, nobody knows about it. I’m sure you haven’t heard
about it, or you. It has a monopoly probably bigger than Bill Gates with Microsoft today.

March 30, 2006
There are very, very few competitors in the field in which they operate. And it was a
fascinating eight years that I spent there.
Q: Wha -- what exactly is their field?
A: That takes some time to explain. When overseas buyers, for instance, buy a cargo of
wheat, or a cargo or iron ore, or a cargo of [indecipherable] from Australia, they pay for
it the minute the ship leaves the Australian port, without knowing really, whether the iron
ore or the coal or the wheat correspond exactly to the specifications that they had
contracted to buy. They needed somebody on the spot -- the buyer needed somebody on
the spot here in Melbourne to confirm that. To sample the cargo, analyze it and advise
the buyer, in those days telegraphically, what the business with [indecipherable] whether
the cargo complied with the specifications. And only then did the overseas buyer pay by
telegraphic transfer. And that firm did that for -- throughout the world, and 1s today still
one of the largest firms in Switzerland. Their shares are probably 10 times as much as
the biggest banks in Switzerland. The firm is now quoted on the stock exchange, and
then the Salmonovitz family probably have only a small stake in it. But it grew into a
huge firm.
Q: Mm. Who had started that business?
A: Mr. Jack Salmonovitz as a young man when he worked at the port of Antwerp.

A: I don’t know. That was -- it’s a legend, I don’t -- I’m not even sure if it’s true, there’s
so many anecdotes going around about that man. But the anecdote that I heard was that
he was working as a port laborer in Antwerp, and he saw flour being loaded at one end
of the ship, and being unloaded half an hour later at the other. So he got to the shipper of
the flour and says, are you happy with what’s happening? He says -- the fellow
apparently told him, I don’t know what’s happening, but I lose half my cargo every time.
That gave him the idea of starting an inspection company. Now, that’s a legend, I don’t
know if it’s true. There are many anecdotes about him.

A: I -- I didn’t own a car when I arrived, but I was given a company car in 1956.
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.
A: And in °58, I was headhunted by one of the clients of that firm, a Jewish export/import
firm by the name of Heine Brothers. It was owned by a man called Walter Heine who
hailed from Leipzig, who came to Australia on the Donera, and he start -- as soon as
possible after the war, he started that export/import firm. We had long before become
close friends, and I was in -- initially very reluctant to join him because I enjoyed the
position I had with General Superintendents, but in the end I succumbed, he was a very
persuasive man. I earned a lot more there than I earned for the Swiss firm. And I joined
him, and I’ve been there ever since.
Q: Still there?
A: I still have a peripheral involvement with the firm, although not on a day to day basis.
He passed away in 1978 at -- and his widow and his two sons recommended that I
become the chief executive officer until his two sons, who were teenagers at that time, or
very young, were old enough to run the firm. And so I became chief executive, chairman
and chief executive in 1978, and I progressively retired from the mid-80’s, first of all
relinquishing the position of chief executive [indecipherable] executive chairman and I
gradually retired from there. I still have an association with them, but only marginal.

doesn’t exist any more, it became a Merchant Bank, which it was eventually taken over
by a Dutch bank that operates in Australia, ING, [indecipherable] the world’s eighth
largest bank, I think. We were listed on the stock exchange in the end, and we were taken
over. That was it. So the two Heine brothers, the two young men -- well, they’re not
young any more, one of them is already a grandfather, they pursue their own interests
now.
Q: What can you say about the local Australian population, in the years [indecipherable]
A: I must say I feel extremely comfortable here. I have, in the course of my career at
Heine Brothers met people in the highest places, from the governor general and prime
minister, down, and met Australians at all levels throughout my business, and I do not
think I’ve had one unpleasant experience in all those years. So I’m very grateful that the
Swiss insisted that I leave.

A: In retrospect. Now, I’m a Swiss citizen. I could, if I wanted to, go back and live there,
but I wouldn’t dream of it.

Q: Do you think that your effects, the effects of the war, the experiences that you
endured, do you think that that has had an effect on you as a parent bringing up children
in Australia?
A: I’m not sure that I can answer that question. I belong to that category of Holocaust
survivors who do not talk to their children about it, for a number of reasons, first of all, I
think this was my way of coping with it, not talking about it. And secondly, it’s really, I
think impossible for anybody to fully comprehend what happened there, and I didn’t want
to burden them with the trauma, I wanted them to have as normal an upbringing a-as
possible, without being neurotic about what happened in the past. Perhaps I’ve done the
right thing, perhaps I’ve done the wrong thing, I don’t know. I mean, my children know
all about it, they’ve seen the sp -- the tape that I -- came from the Spielberg interview, so
it’s not that they don’t know about it, but we don’t talk about it.

no longer target number one, Muslims have taken over that spot. But you never know
what’s around the corner. I’m a great supporter -- perhaps a one -- the one thing that
shaped my attitude is that I am a great supporter of Israel. I -- not only have I done
business with Israel, but I’ve also been chairman and treasurer of the Australia Israel
Chamber of Commerce. And I still -- and I was a board member for many years -- and I
still visit them at least once a week, and I have a very intense involvement with their

late for him, or for that matter for us.

morning to Sunday school at the temple in Abber Road.
Q: Mm-hm. Can we just take a short break? Can you tell us about your Jewish identity in
Australia?
A: Well, I’ve always been involved in Jewish organizations ever since I arrived in
Australia, and I have only had two positions in Australia, and both were for Jewish
firms. The Geneva firm was Jewish owned, and Heine Brothers was Jewish owned. I’ve
never in my whole life worked for a non-Jewish firm, although the clients of the firm
were overwhelmingly non-Jewish, and I got on extremely well with every one of them.
So I feel consciously very, very Jewish, but I have no problem in dealing with non-Jews.
Q: Did you mix socially with both?
A: Most of our social contacts of most of our friends today are Jewish, but we have a
small number of non-Jewish friends with whom we are very, very close.
Q: Mm-hm. What about your children?

Interview with Gert Silver
March 30, 2006
A: My children -- my son 1s a doctor, and he lives in Castlemaine, about 150 kilometers
north of Melbourne, he has a clinic there that employs six doctors and he 1s very, very
happy to live in a small place of 8000 inhabitants with one traffic light. He wouldn’t want
to live in Melbourne any more. My daughter is a nurse. She has four children. She also
loves living in small places. She lives in Victor Harbor in south Australia. Again as a --
a place with a population of 8000 people. She has four children, one of whom is 26, she
works as a food technologist at Nestlé. Number two is a paramedic in Adelaide. Number
three is in his final year of studies of agriculture at Adelaide University. The youngest, a
girl, Emily is in her final year at school. My son has three children, and they’re all at
universities in Melbourne. Two at Melbourne University, and one at Monash
University.
Q: Do you have a lot of contact with them?
A: Well, with the [indecipherable] their own lives, but we see them regularly.
Q: What about the 1 -- the Jewish identity of your children?
A: My children know that they are Jewish, they know all about Jewish customs, they’ve
been involved in Jewish organizations. My son in [indecipherable]. My daughter was
very involved, my son was Bar Mitzvah, my daughter was Bat Mitzvah. But they have
both married out. I think their children know relatively little about Judaism. That’s
something I’m not particularly proud of, but I’ve learned to live with it.

Interview with Gert Silver
March 30, 2006
Q: Did they have Bar Mitzvahs, the boys? Your grandsons?
A: No, none of them, no.
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So you say you’re not -- you’re not proud of it, it’s -- you’ve
learned to live with it.
A: Yes
Q: Is it something that was --
A: Th-There was nothing else I could do about it.
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Did they grow up mixing with Jewish chil -- socializing with
Jewish children?
A: No, they -- they went to a -- non-Jewish schools. My son went to Trinity College in
his final years, and my daughter went to [indecipherable] secondary school. And whilst
many of their friends were Jewish, they also had many non-Jewish friends.
[indecipherable] since they were at university, somehow, I don’t know, Judaism drifted.
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.
A: They found non-Jewish partners, and that was it.
Q: Mm-hm. And is your wife of the same opinion as you?
A: Yes, I think so.
Q: So at this stage in your life, do you still participate in the celebration of festivals,
Jewish festivals?
A: Sure.

Interview with Gert Silver
March 30, 2006
Q: Synagogue?
A: Yeah, yeah. We had a Seder, celebrate Hanukah.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: We go, not every year, to the synagogue. We’re still members of the synagogue. We
don’t go very often, but o-on occasions.
Q: And your children and grandchildren participate in the Passover Seder?
A: When they are in Melbourne, yes, yeah.
Q: Otherwise, who do you spend it with?
A: With friends.
Q: With friends?
A: Mm.
Q: Mm-hm. I'd like to ask you, is there -- is there a message that you would like to leave?
I asked you before, but is there anything that -- that you’ve thought of subsequently, to
your grandchildren and to future generations, based on your experiences?
A: Well, I don’t talk to them about my experiences. I tell them very often something that
my father hammered into me when I was a young child. He said never mind the 10
commandments, just live after the 11" commandment. I asked him what the 11"
commandment, never do unto others what you don’t want others to do unto you. If you
follow that, all the other 10 commandments are included in that. That I’ve been telling
them ad nauseum since they were very little. And I think they live by that.

Q: Mm-hm.
A: And I think it’s very important to me.
Q: You’ve commented several times about the loss of family, and your desire to continue
and to have your own family. Are there any particular messages you would like to give
them about family values?
A: Not really, I mean I got married at 21 and many people today ask me how come you
got married at -- at that young age. And remember, I had nobody at that time. My father,
my mother, my brother, my sister, they’re all dead, and I was intent on starting a new
generation, a new family. And I’m very glad I married when I was 21. I’m very glad we
had our children when we were very young, so that we have now lived to see our children
in -- into middle age.
Q: Mm-hm. Do you do anything to commemorate lost family members?
A: We put the outside candles, and that’s all.
Q: For your parents --
A: Yes.
Q: -- and siblings?
A: Yeah, well, not for -- not for -- and actually not for my parents, for my wife’s parents
because their date of death was known, they died in Switzerland. But I don’t know when
-- when my parents died, and there’s no cemetery for them.
Q: Mm-hm. So there’s no time during the year when you would light a candle for them?

Interview with Gert Silver
March 30, 2006
A: No, but I think of them all the time.
Q: Mm-hm. What are the messages that you remember from your parents?
A: I think my parents gave me a very good, Jewish education. I think they instilled values
in me that I try and installed in my own children, and I have nothing but fond memories
of my parents.
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Thank you. Can you tell us about this photo?
A: That photo was sent to me by my aunt, who had survived the war in Chile, and she
told me that’s my father and me, when I was very, very young.
Q: Could you have a guess at how old you might have been?
A: Maybe two years, three maybe. No more than that. That is a picture of my mother and
my sister. So that would have been taken, assuming that my sister there was one year old,
she was born in ’35, so that photo would have been taken in 1936, 70 years ago. Amazing
that it survived. We are worried about the longevity of tapes. That is an article that
appeared in a Swiss newspaper, on the day, or after the day of our arrival in Switzerland
on the 23" of June, 1945. We arrived from Buchenwald and the article, in the German
language, describes basically how we came there, why we came there, and basically a
little bit of background that we had all spent time in a concentration camp, and that we
came to Switzerland for recuperation. This is a photo taken by a press photographer in
Switzerland on our arrival before we disembarked from the train, also on the 23" of
June, 1945. And this is wa -- this was also taken on our arrival in Switzerland, and I am

almost certain that I am the person who has his hat out of the window on that photo.
Another photo taken on the 23™ of June, 1945, this is probably, at least as far as I’m
concerned the most precious one, because three of the boys who are on that photo, except
the one on the extreme left, came to Melbourne. The two on the right, Jack
[indecipherable] and Montek Akerfelt have regrettably passed away in recent times,
and Joe Baker is still very much alive, and a very prosperous businessman 1n
Melbourne. Another photo taken on the same -- on the occasion of our arrival. The only
person I recognize on that photo is Moneek Freidman who is the boy on the extreme
left.
Q: Okay. One here, one here.
A: Ah, here.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Again a photo taken by the press photographer. Regrettably, neither I nor any of the
persons whom I have consulted, know the name of that person. That’s my wife, Rifka,
and we’ve been married now for 57 years, and hopefully it’Il last. This is my daughter
Ruth, her son Anthony, her daughter Emily, her son Adam, and her son Daniel. These
are the three children of my son. This 1s Elizabeth, this is Jeremy, this is Rachel. All of
them students at Melbourne University at the moment. This is a document confirming
my status as a refugee. This is a diploma confirming that I have successfully completed
my apprenticeship as a dental technician in Geneva. This is a do -- my -- the first

document issued to me after the war in 1946. This was issued by the Swiss government.
Until then, I had no documentation whatsoever that I existed, or who I was. This is a
passport photo of me, taken in 1946, 60 years ago. You can tell the difference. This is a
travel document, issued to me by the Swiss government in 1947. I needed it because it
was the first time I left Switzerland for Berlin to visit my uncle. This photo 1s of my son
Denny. He lives in Castlemaine, about 150 kilometers north of Melbourne. He’s a
medical practitioner by profession, but a very dedicated and enthusiastic musician, and at
the moment he is the director of the Melbourne Mandolin orchestra. You asked me
earlier whether I recollect the interview by Professor Boder. That interview took place, I
believe in August 1946, approximately 14 months after my arrival in Switzerland from
Buchenwald. During that period, and in the month after that, we were interviewed almost
on a weekly basis, by the Swiss government, the Swiss Red Cross, Swiss newspapers,
Swiss radio stations, Jewish organizations in Switzerland, America, Canada, Australia
and South America. We averaged, as I said, about one interview a week and I really do
not recollect that particular interview.
Q: Thanks very much.
