>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon and welcome to the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum. My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public
program, First Person. Thank you for joining us today. This is our 15th year of the
First Person program. Our First Person today is Mrs. Regina Spiegel, whom we shall
meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis
Franklin Smith Foundation, with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein
Foundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust
who share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust.
Each of our First Person guests serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our
program will continue twice weekly through the middle of August.

The museum's website, at www.ushmm.org provides information about each of
our upcoming First Person guests.

Anyone interested in keeping in touch with the Museum and its programs can
complete the Stay Connected Card in their program which is this card here, or speak
with a museum representative at the back of the theater.

In doing so, you will also receive an electronic copy of Regina Spiegel's biography
so that you can remember and share her testimony after you leave here today.

Regina will share with us her "First Person" account of her experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows at the end of our
program, we will have an opportunity for you to ask Regina some questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are
about to hear from Regina is one individual's account of the Holocaust.

We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her introduction. Regina
Spiegel was born May 12th, 1926 in Radom, Poland. Her father worked as a leather
cutter to a large shoe manufacturer and her mother took care of their six children. On
this map of Europe, the arrow points Poland and on this map of Poland, the arrow
points to Radom. On September 1, 1939, German troops invaded Poland and
Regina's town was attacked. Like all Jews in Radom, Regina's family was ordered
into a newly created ghetto. Her parents decided to smuggle her out of the ghetto by
bribing one of the guards. She escaped Pionki where her soldier sister Rozia lived.
Soon Regina was conscripted for forced labor in the town's munitions factory. There
she forked a close friendship with Sam Spiegel, a fellow inmate. This photograph is of
Regina's sister Hanka who was taken from the ghetto and sent to Treblinka where she
was killed. We close with a photograph of Regina and Sam on their wedding day in
the Foehrenwald displaced person's camp in Bavaria.

Upon Regina and Sam's arrival in Washington, D.C. in late 1947, Sam found work
as a sheet metal worker and over time built a successful business in the construction
industry. Regina and Sam have continued to live in the Washington, D.C. area since
1947.

They have three daughters and nine grandchildren, with the youngest being
twelve years old. Their first great-grandchild was born in 2011. Regina has spoken
many times about her experience during the Holocaust to a wide variety of groups
such as numerous schools, including my daughter's former high school.

Regina's volunteer work for the museum includes working at the Donor's Desk,
where you will find her on Wednesdays, with the exception of today. Sam was an
active volunteer at the museum, but his recent illness has prevented him from
continuing. He spent a great deal of time working on the "Remember the Child Who
Perished" program which calls upon young Jews as part of their Bar and Bat Mitzvahs
to honor children who died during the Holocaust. Sam searched for the names of
children who perished, the name of the town from which they came, and when and
where they perished.

Until recently, Regina and Sam had participated every other year in the "March of
the Living" which took them to Auschwitz and Birkenau and other major camps, as
well as to Israel in most years. They went on 11 "Marches of the Living."

With that | would like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mrs. Regina
Spiegel.

(Applause)

Regina, thank you so much for your willingness to be our first person today and
to be here with us. You have so much to tell us in a short time. An hour, so we
should just get started right away. We'll start first, Regina, Germany invaded Poland
on September ist, 1939. You were just 13 years of age and living in Radom. Tell
us first a little bit about your family and your life before the Germans came. And then
we'll talk about their occupation.

>> Regina Spiegel: Okay. Thank you very much for having me here today. | love
doing these things because | always think of it as | am remembering my family
whenever | am in this place. It's unbelievable. But we as a family before the war, we

-- and | was a kid going to school, | always felt very comfortable. | always felt a lot of
love from my family. And | never had to worry about anything. That's the way |
looked at it. Because | always figured my mother and my father would take care of it.
The only time when | got worried when | saw a -- it was on a Friday night and my
mother was busy preparing for the Shabbat. You know, we have like before we have
a holiday almost like. And so | came running to my mother telling her what | saw
outside. | happened to be on the street. They were -- they took a man that was
wearing a beard. | don't know. Maybe he was not a religious man. But he was
wearing a beard. And you know what? | saw them putting him on the back of the
horses. And that was scared me because | came in running and telling this to my
mother. My mother, | guess she probably knew but she wanted -- she said, "Relax.
Everything is going to be all right." You know, they never wanted to tell their kids that
a lot of trouble is waiting for us. And besides, | will tell you truthfully, my father wasn't
so much concerned either. Because he happened to be during the First World War
and the Germans were in Poland too, they came there. And he had no problem with
them. So he figured they can't be that strict. But, of course, it was --

>> Bill Benson: Regina, the Germans invaded Poland within a week after
September ist and came to your town of Radom. You remember that, don't you?

>> Regina Spiegel: Oh, of course. Because the way we lived, we had a lot of
people who lived in the same place and we were all neighbors and we knew all the
kids. So we always made good time with these things, everybody by themselves.
You lock the door and by yourself. This is a complete very different life for us.

>> Bill Benson: And soon after the Germans came, | think your father lost his job

right away, didn't he?

>> Regina Spiegel: Not only my father. All the Jews were not allowed to go to
work. The kids were not allowed to go to school. And we just couldn't understand.
Because we figured why not? Why not go to school? And now when | speak to
young people, | always tell them to really be very happy that they have schools to go
to. Because in our place the kids -- and they took these younger kids right away, they
took him away. And where they took him we didn't even know. And we always talk
about certain things. | always say the biggest -- what they did to the children were
their worst place, you know. Because the kids were the first victims. It was kids right
away.

>> Bill Benson: It wouldn't be long, would it, Regina, before you and your family
and other Jews in Radom were forced into a ghetto. Tell us what happened when
they sent you to the ghetto?

>> Regina Spiegel: Well, what is a ghetto? You know, to this -- you know, to try to
tell you what a ghetto was, they took -- they chased us out from our home and they
made picked up rapidly from other homes and they put barbed wire around and this
was the ghetto. We couldn't take practically anything with us. So as a result, right
away hunger sets in. When you cannot -- like here my mother had just made a
beautiful dinner. And we weren't even -- we couldn't even eat it. Because right away
they set one thing after the other. And they came out of it.

>> Bill Benson: With food being so difficult and your father, of course, wasn't
working, how were you managing -- how were you able to eat when you were in the
ghetto?

>> Regina Spiegel: Well, see, in Europe, you always had some kind of thing, you
know, and everything had to be made of the good stuff. So let's say you had a
bracelet. You had whatever it was in gold. My mother would barter with the
neighbors and she would give them one thing and they could give her something else.
And that's the way we managed to go through from one day to the other. Not too
much, but that's what it would happen.

>> Bill Benson: And Regina, tell us about the role that your sister played in also
helping to feed the family. Because your sister wasn't there with you.

>> Regina Spiegel: Yeah. | had a sister who watched -- she was a dentist. And
she lived in a smaller community. And she came marriage to -- and of course she
knew all the people from that community. And the other community was called Pionki.
And Pionki helped me to survive. Didn't help the rest of my family because that's
where my mother sent me. She sent me. But! didn't want to go. | wanted to stay
with the family for anything. But | -- | don't know why. | had a sister that was two
years older than | was. And | kind of bargained with my mother when she told me |
should go to Pionki. And | didn't want to leave. She said, "No, you are going." And
when my mother said you are going, you had to go, you know? No, because this is
nowadays | see my kids with their children. My daughter will probably spend two
hours explaining to her daughter why she can't do this or this.
(Laughter. )
My mother just said "You are going."
And | could not explain to this day. You know, when | finally got out of the ghetto, |
wouldn't even say good-bye to her. But this helped me say during the war, | always

say to myself, but | have to see my mother because | didn't say good-bye to her. So
I'll have to live to be able to say good-bye to my mother. Of course, | never achieved
it.

>> Bill Benson: And your mother selected you to go because you were the
youngest child. So she wanted to save you.

>> Regina Spiegel: | was hoping that when she after the war that when she --
when | could talk to her and ask her, | was hoping that | would find out. But
apparently, she saw something in me even though | was younger than my sister.
Maybe because | always, as | say, | never stood still. | always run around places. |
always jumped on trees or whatever. You know? So | guess maybe that's why. But
my mother just made up her mind that | leave the ghetto.

>> Bill Benson: And Regina, when your mother told you had to leave the ghetto
and go to your sister in Pionki, it wasn't just a matter of walking out of the ghetto. How
did you get out?

>> Regina Spiegel: How? That's interesting. Because | don't even think about it.
Because | didn't have -- you had to -- it was quite a distance. It was about
30 kilometers from our place, which was quite a distance. But during that time, there
was something in our -- in Poland that if you traveled with an adult, your ticket -- you
didn't have to have a ticket. So when | got out on the train without any money and the
conductor came to whether you have the things to showing that you can go,
apparently, when | saw him, | started -- there was a lady sitting. And | started talking
to her. So she just -- he probably decided that | am probably with her. And that's why
he didn't even ask me for a ticket or anything like this. And that's how | managed to

get over to Pionki, to this other little town that's where my sister lived.

>> Bill Benson: So when you got to Pionki to get to your sister, what happened
then?

>> Regina Spiegel: Well, | never realized what an important little town Pionki was.
You know, it had the largest munition factory in Poland. And the Germans wouldn't let
this go because they figured they hit the jackpot because they had right away people
to get to work and they had people to start working with this munitions. It was -- |
mean, to shoot, you know.

>> Bill Benson: Making bullets and things like that?

>> Regina Spiegel: Exactly. And they used it. And stuff like that. My sister, once |
got to my sisters, my sister had a baby. The baby was 18 months old. And she gave
him away to a family. But what happened her neighbors, the lady's neighbors started,
you know, saying you probably saving keeping a Jewish kid. And you must have
gotten very rich. And | said, "My sister, she didn't have money to make -- not even
make herself rich, to make anybody else rich."

| definitely knew she didn't have this kind of money. So she had -- she gave the
baby back and told them where my sister was. And they came and they took out my
sister with the baby. And they put them on the wagons. And they disappeared and
we never saw them again. That was -- after the war, | went to see that woman,
because | was still a kid and | didn't understand. So she was actually the one that she
explained to me the way that she took the baby, because the baby was looked like an
Aryan child because that's what they were looking for. You know, Aryan children. He
had long blond hair and you know nothing -- he was really -- he was a gorgeous baby.

So when | came to her and | talked with her after the war, | really understood because
| was trying not to be hateful to the woman because | figured, look, when she took that
baby in she knew she would pay if they caught her. But at a certain part time, you
can't always keep what you think you can make. And | understood and we actually
had a very nice gathering. And later on, of course, | went to a different place. So that
was it.

>> Bill Benson: So Regina, you now lost your sister, you're alone in Pionki. You're
doing forced labor in Pionki. While you were there, you met your future husband,
Sam.

>> Regina Spiegel: Well, like | said, you could never rely -- you Know, with me, it
was always | don't have -- | wish | would have the energy that | had then. | was
impossible. Because when | met my -- it turned out that he became my husband. But
at the time, he was a boyfriend. | -- as a matter of fact, | told like -- because we had
one Sunday little walk in the camp. And he was -- | saw him. He was looking at me
and walking next to me. And | said, "Can | help you?"
(Laughter. )
And he said, "I know you."
| said, "You know me?" So | started asking him "Are you from Radom?" He said, "No."
| said, "Where are you from?" He told me the name Kozienice. | told him I'd never
been there. But it turned out he came at a good time because | will tell you my sister
was taken away with the baby. And here | was by myself in a camp where you really
had to work very hard. And my sister was -- she took her away because actually she
was able to take the baby with her. And she tried to run away and she they caught

her and she and the baby were shot. You know, this was a horrible time. | hate to
talk about it. | Know | have to talk about it. Because people have to know what it was.
But I, myself, don't like to talk about it. Because you wouldn't believe it because I'm
here, you know, for many years. I've been here, that | would be like that. But | always
kind of felt like how come that | am still walking around, you know? And so many
people and your friends. You know, everybody -- you turned around, they were gone.
They were gone. So this was the time.

>> Bill Benson: If | remember right, Regina, as you got to know Sam, the men
were on one side of the camp and the women and there was some barbed wire and
there was a water spigot and you would talk to each other and that's how you got to
know each other. But conveniently as the Russians got closer, they closed down
Pionki.

>> Regina Spiegel: Yes, they closed up this camp. And that's the time when Sam
came to me to tell me "Look, if we ever get out -- " because he was four years older
than | was. So he understood a little bit more than | did. And he told me, he said,
"Look, this is no play thing. You remember that you have to be careful because there
are a lot of Germans around here. And you have to try to stay away from them."
And | guess | learned my lesson pretty good. And my boyfriend then, he -- he and |
were picked to go to a place called Treblinka. You know, Treblinka, do | have -- |
don't -- I'm looking. | usually wear it. And you can see -- oh, this is it. You see they
give you a mark. This is from Auschwitz. When you got there, this is what they gave.
They took even your name away. You know, | always thought of a name being very
important. But not to them. This was the only camp that they, the minute you came

in, that's what they did. They took away everything. They took away your clothes. |
always said | lived in a place where my father never saw me naked. Here they set --
and this was in my mind always. | have to live through because you could almost give
up. But when you were around there, you figured you can't. Because not only is it
dependent on you. Maybe you made a friend with somebody. And you might be also
kind of hoping that she doesn't do anything that is not very good for you. So | became
like here, watch out, watch out, whatever you have to do, we will do here. But,
hopefully, maybe if we survive, we'll be able to get our whatever it is back.

>> Bill Benson: Regina, you were, of course, selected then to do slave labor.

>> Regina Spiegel: Oh, yes.

>> Bill Benson: So tell us where they sent you and what you were forced to do.

>> Regina Spiegel: Well, one was this. And this was a place you really -- it's it's
probably -- only who can think of these kind of things. But they managed to do that.
And also after this | went to another camp. You see, | was lucky. Not that | was
smart. But you see at that time, the Germans were you know, they had goiten a little
-- a lot of the Russians were coming closer and they have also start thinking about
their own things. So sometimes instead of killing us, they decided why should we kill
them? They're such good people that they do such wonderful work, why not keep
them? We always have time to kill them. And that's what they did. They used that to
the last minute. And that's when we -- you know, that's why a lot -- | want you to know
a lot of kids when they see that, especially if their father is a doctor, they always offer
that their father would take it off for me. And | said no, you don't have to worry. If you
want to, when you talk to your father, | will send him my face.

(Laughter. )
But not -- | don't -- | said this is something -- and actually a lot of survivors, did take off
the tattoos. But | never felt that | did anything to deserve it. And so | felt to me it was
like nothing. And | gave them -- you know, other people that they shouldn't look at it
that way. Because if not, they'll never get out of there. And thank God, eventually we
did make it. You know?

>> Bill Benson: Regina, after you were sent to Auschwitz and you lost track of
where Sam was, you were separated, other than your sister who you lost in Pionki,
did you know at that time what had happened to the rest of your family?

>> Regina Spiegel: Absolutely not. No. They never told you anything. And ina
way they did us a favor. Because had we known -- because | will tell you truthfully,
when | was liberated, and when | found out that all my family is practically gone, the
only one | had a brother who happened to be in the Army. And he was gone as well.
And he managed to get away, you know, get away. But all the others, they were
killed. Because you didn't -- they didn't believe in keeping -- to give you a chance to
maybe find your family.

>> Bill Benson: Regina, you would be forced to go to several different camps to do
slave labor and you ended up at Bergen-Belsen. Tell us what that was like.

>> Regina Spiegel: Bergen-Belsen was a place that you were lucky if you could
get up. It was the same thing, you know. They were constantly over you. They
looked out for you. Never -- you had to manage practically your whole life by yourself.
And if you would know most of us were young people and we didn't know if -- about
this kind of things. So we weren't prepared for them. We weren't.

>> Bill Benson: Regina, as the war was coming to a close, the Allies advanced, the
Russian Allies advanced, and the Russian forces the allies continued to move you
deeper. You ended up at Elsnig by Torgau. And what did you do there?

>> Regina Spiegel: They made something -- | didn't know they showed me what to
do and that's what | did. But | will tell you in that camp, they were -- we could see that
they were a little bit in trouble. So we looked like constantly and all of a sudden, one
day they were using -- they were like forcing us to dig ditches and this were -- they
were digging the ditches all of a sudden we see airplanes. And they started throwing
bombs. We figured hey, this is not German bombs. This is American. And actually,
we were hit by the Americans but thank God for that because the Germans ran away,
you know, and we could kind of -- | mean some of the people got killed because you
know when they don't Know where to stop. But we were able to run away into, we
saw across there were woods. And we ran into the woods. And we figured we'd stay
there until we can kind of -- but we didn't have a drop of water with us. No nothing.
Not a piece of bread with us. Nothing. But then | figured --

>> Bill Benson: Regina, I'm going to stop you for a minute. | want to make sure
you tell us something before you go on if you don't mind. You were on the train when
you saw the American planes coming. That was Hitler's birthday, wasn't it?

>> Regina Spiegel: It was.

>> Bill Benson: Tell us about that.

>> Regina Spiegel: Well, as a matter of fact, they told us that that was Hitler's
birthday. And they were -- so we decided, ah, the Americans came to give hima
birthday party.

(Laughter. )
lt would be -- it was wonderful. But you know what? We didn't have to worry any
more. Because at that time we all ran into the woods because we didn't want to even
want American planes to hit us. So what happens when we were running, | see in the
distance far away a soldier and he looked. He didn't look like he was a German
because his uniform was different. So | run over to him and | could see that he
happens to be Russian. And you know, | suppose -- but | remember my parents
apparently were -- you know, during that time, you know, sometimes they used the
Russian words or something like this. And | ran over to him and | said to him actually
in Russian (Russian word) | knew that meant friend. | said you are Russian? He said,
"Yes."

And he said go into the woods. Tell all the women to come out. We were like
about 300 women from the -- from the tasks. And | was wondering how does he
know? He said, "We heard you."

You know, you made a little bit too much noise because we were hiding. So | said
what did you want us to do? We are only women. 300 women by ourselves we have
to make some kind of noise. So he said -- and actually, he told us you are -- the war
is over. You are free. | looked at him. We are free? What am | supposed to do now?
You know? Because you know what? | sat down -- | mean, | didn't sit down, but |
stood up and | started counting my age for the first time | ever looked at my age. |
said, "How old am | now?" And do you know | realized | was almost, like, 19 years old.
And here he tells me that I'm liberated. And actually, | had -- | never celebrated that
birthday because | don't like to share it with Hitler. So that's one thing right away out.

But as | say, we were liberated. And we asked him what should we do. We still didn't
forget about food. And they said you pick up someplace. And we did. As we kept on
walking, we managed to stop at some farmer's and they gave us something. And also
it was like we -- when they realized who they helped, they said, "Don't worry. People
will come eventually."

Because | walked in to a bakery to ask the baker to give me some bread. And
asked him in German. He said do you have any money? | said who has money?
What are you talking? | didn't even know that this kind of stuff existed. And really ina
way, Our life was really started from then on.

>> Bill Benson: Regina, if | remember right, when you and Sam were separated
and left Pionki, he said to you "If we survive, meet me in my hometown."
Tell us about that.

>> Regina Spiegel: Well, you know, it was -- we were -- this was when we were in
the really not such a nice camp. And he -- | was shocked when | saw him that he kind
of snuck in. And | said to him "What are you doing here?" He said, "Look, Regina, if
we get out of this, meet me in my hometown."

And | said "Why your hometown, why not mine? | have a hometown too."

| was always kind of -- you know.
(Laughter. )
| got so used to doing things for myself. And of course we made friends with
some of the girls and we tried to help out one another.
>> Bill Benson: But you did in fact decide to go to his hometown and try to find
him, didn't you?

>> Regina Spiegel: | had no choice.
(Laughter. )
What happened was he was an entrepreneur, you Know? And he found the mill --

>> Bill Benson: And he got liberated much earlier than you, didn't he?

>> Regina Spiegel: Yeah. He ran away from -- he was on the march, on one of
the marches which they called the death march. And then they stopped because the
Germans had to stop sometimes to take a rest, too. So when they stopped, my
boyfriend at the time, he ran away and he wasn't too far from Poland. So he knew
that earlier and he ran away and got, actually, to Poland. And later on, when we
finally made connection, what he told me that he was staying there, | said why? |
can't stay here because | have to go people to find my mother. And, of course, there
was no one there and you had to get used to that you can make a life for yourself
without your parent. And it's not easy, but you learn because, look, | have three
wonderful girls. | made a life for myself instead of killing myself, which | wouldn't have
done good to anybody except probably to the Germans. For us, it was a way out.
Whenever they told any of us that we would ever be able to have children we never --
because they always -- you know, they use so many things on us that we always
thought that they probably did something to so we couldn't even have any children.
But apparently, it wasn't so. So we accused them of something that wasn't -- they
never thought of it.

>> Bill Benson: Regina, when you did get to Sam's town and he had started up the
mill there.

>> Regina Spiegel: Yes, it was very, very, nothing like a mill. This was his friend's

parents’ mill. The parents got killed. And nobody had to eat. Even the Poles they
didn't have to eat anything. So my husband figured this is a mill. They were begging.
They would come with flour and there was nobody to do -- to work with the flour. So
my husband, that's what he did. He started the mill. He fixed it up. He was a very
good -- even he was a sheet metal man. And he always was a very good to this day,
he's still sick, but | miss him so much.

>> Bill Benson: Because he could fix anything, couldn't he?

>> Regina Spiegel: He could fix anything. There wasn't a thing that he couldn't fix.
So they made up the mill to run. And people were coming from far away to bring the
flour to make the regular flour so they can bake bread. And nobody else was sitting
there. Nobody else was thinking of it. But my husband.

>> Bill Benson: So what made you decide eventually to leave there and come to
the United States?

>> Regina Spiegel: Well, you know, as a kid, | always loved the United States. |
don't know. | gave him probably more than they deserve. But you know, | always
thought of United States, America, that it's the best country. And itis. If you could do
anything. You know, you know what it means in Poland to go to school and in Poland
to until the 7" grade, that was free. But anything else, your parents to pay for. So as
a result, it wasn't so easy to have, you know, Tom, my oldest brother, if he made
some money, he saved it for my sister so she could go to school. | mean, it wasn't
that you send three children at the same time to school. It was rather hard. It was a
hard place to live in, really. So | -- the only way | wanted to do is go back -- | had an
uncle who lived in the United States. And after the war, | don't know why they found

out that | got sick, you know, that there was something wrong with my arms. | couldn't
touch my arms like the blood was something wrong with it. | don't know why. But
that's what | had. And when | went to the hospital, they every week they put me
together with my uncle. Except | will tell you he put a net in the Jewish four words.
My uncle never left. So it took somebody that lived in this place who came from our
town. And she knew my uncle and she called up my uncle and she said, "You better
look in the papers. Your -- what did she call me? You're like a niece, your niece is
looking for you."
And you know what? Within, like, four days my uncle had gotten for me papers.
And that's how | was able to go. | turned around to my boyfriend and | said, "Well, this
time if you -- the only way you can come to the United States, you have to go on my
ticket."
(Laughter. )
>> Bill Benson: And you have to marry me to be on my ticket.
(Laughter. )
And so in 1947 -- you'd stayed for a while in the displaced person's camp where you
got married.
>> Regina Spiegel: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: And you finally got here in 1947.
>> Regina Spiegel: Yes. | will tell you, he knows more than | do.
(Laughter. )
>> Bill Benson: Because you're tutored me well.
>> Regina Spiegel: | will tell you. You see, after so many years, it's really -- it's a

miracle that you can remember anything. Really. That's why | figured maybe | should
start doing that. Because before it gets worse that you can't remember. Because it's
very hard.

>> Bill Benson: Regina, you've shared with us only just a glimpse of what you went
through, just a very little --

>> Regina Spiegel: Yes.

>> Bill Benson: And even from that, we know how horrible things were for you
during that time. What do you think made it possible for you to survive?

>> Regina Spiegel: | think what it made because | always had this -- I'm not like
this now. But then | knew that | had to do it for my mother. | like to do things for
people. And for families, you know. | always did. And | knew that if | don't -- you
know, kind of shared with this thing an do this, what kind of life would | have? So it
was in a way for me a good way to do it. And, of course, when this place, when they
first told it, we were with it from the first thing. We used to collect money for the
museum. In my place, | had people come to my house. And just that's all you have to
do is leave some money and | would cook and bake and do anything. But that's the
way | -- and | love it.

>> Bill Benson: I'm going to turn, go ahead, Regina, I'm sorry. I'm going to turn
back to Regina in just a minute to close our program. Before | do, | want to thank all
of you for being with us for "first person" remind you while have two programs a week
on Mondays and Thursdays until the middle of August. Hopefully you'll come back
and join at some future time. It's our tradition that the first person gets the last word.
Before | give it to Regina to get the last word, I'd like to let you Know for one because

we haven't had a chance for you to ask questions, Regina, you'll stay for a few
minutes afterwards?

>> Regina Spiegel: Absolutely.

>> Bill Benson: So when Regina steps off stage if you want to come say hi to her
and ask her a question, please do that. When Regina finishes, we're going to ask you
to stand if you don't mind because our photographer Joel wants to get a picture of
Regina looking this way with you all in the background. So, if you don't mind, when
Regina's done, please rise and then after the photographs, Regina will go over there
and you can talk.

>> Regina Spiegel: Maybe they don't want to rise?

>> Bill Benson: Well they may not. But | have a hunch they will. So Regina, what
are your closing thoughts for us?

>> Regina Spiegel: The closing thoughts, really, | don't have -- there were too
many. I'm out of talk. But let me see, | have a couple things. You see, you see like
you can see the type of a person | had that, most of us, survivors of Auschwitz, you
think we always go down with our faces and never be happy. No, it's different way.
Because we think of gratitude. Not violence. We must reject indifference. You see,
indifference, that's where we shouldn't even think about. But we shouldn't be
indifferent. When you see people being -- | always tell the kids, you know, we just
didn't know the word. But in Auschwitz, what did they do to us? | mean, they could
have done -- they could have probably won the war if they didn't. But they were so
thinking so much of us how they can do to us like we would never exist. This is what |
always pray that something like this. And because | always say, if we are indifferent,

it helps our aggressor, it doesn't help us, really. And what is it and never be a victim.
Really. And that's what we were. We were really victims. We tried not to. But we
were victims. And to remember. What is memory? It's a necessary response to --
response to indifference and what the world should learn. We have to learn from
anything that certain things are not good. And when we see them, we should help.
And | think that's probably what | will tell.
(Applause)
