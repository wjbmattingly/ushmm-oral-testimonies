Q: Pardon?
A: My first awareness of it.

this boasting of how good they were, and — and the sports, and — and then things
were forbidden, and then we couldn’t go to the movies, we couldn’t sit on park

And one of the girls that had been my friend, and was in school with me, had
become a very famous actress.
Q: No kidding?
A: I saw her picture. And so, somebody asked me, did you contact her? It had gone

A: Oh yes.
Q: Seventies, 80s?
A: Probably around that time.
Q: Okay, okay. And so you never did contact her?
A: No.
Q: Did the rejection ever come in a very obvious way?
A: No, it was subtle. But you know, this is part of my upbringing. My parents
instilled a spirit in us that, no matter what happens to you, you’re still yourself. You
don’t lose yourself, you don’t lose your value. And that’s what kept us going.
Q: Those are very important lessons.
A: Yes, very.

A: And so I’m — you know, we’re so fortunate. Not every child has that.

A: By example. Not by lecturing.
Q: Okay.
A: It — it helped me when I came to this country, which is, of course, much later,
and we may come to that.
Q: Yes, yes. So, did your level of living change much in 1933 to °36, those first
years of Hitler being in power?
A: It did later on, yes, because for instance, you couldn’t have a maid any more, that
was under 45, because that’s when those — when they couldn’t have children any
more, and they didn’t want to work for Jews. So we had a part time maid, over 46.
Q: I see. I see.
A: And our apartment was smaller by then, because my mother couldn’t take care
of anything big. And I guess the money wasn’t there either, I don’t know.
Q: Okay. Were your parents less — how was their manor? Did their manor change,
as time went on? Were they less happy? Were they more worried?

But, course that changed after Crystal Night.
Q: Okay, so you were still in Berlin during Kristallnacht?
A: I was still in — yes, I was. But before that, what happened — no, th — I don’t —
happened around that time, I wanted to go — I wanted to leave so badly. And I was a
stamp collector at the time. One Sunday afternoon I was looking at my stamps, and
I found an envelope that my uncle had given me, that came from America, and it
had an American stamp on it, addressed to him, and he gave it to me because I — he
knew I was collecting stamps. So, he happened to be in our house that Sunday, and
I went in there, and I said, who are these people that wrote to you from America?

number, there were a lot of people ahead of us. So I said to him — my father, I said, I
don’t want to stay and wait here and maybe not get out. He had a friend in London,
and that friend had a friend — an English friend, who was in amer — who was a
Quaker, a British Quaker. And he told him — he said to my father’s friend, we’ve
been thinking what we can do for German Jews, and maybe this is something we
can do. Maybe we can take one of them. And it so happened — you know, life is so

one of us.
Q: Did your sister want to go as much as you did?
A: I guess. I think. Well, we were a pair, anyway. So we send — we wrote to them,

had to take the name ...
Q: Israel.

Interview with Ursula Marx °°
June 8, 2016
A: Yes. I didn’t want to go. My husband always took me on his business trips. But
when he said he was going to Germany, I said I’m not going. But two weeks before
he left, I changed my mind, and I went.
Q: And what was it like for you?
A: It wasn’t easy.
Q: Where were you in Germany?
A: We were in southern Germany. You know, I had the hate. But I went to a
lecture once, somebody who had also been in Germany, and he said he had that
hate, and it destroyed him, and so he became — he — he changed. And so, I changed.
Every once in a while it would come through, but I— I was a happier person after
that.
Q: How do you change this?
A: I reasoned with myself. People who are alive now, were not Nazis, they weren’t
even born yet. So how could I hate them?
Q: It worked?
A: It worked. Most of the time, let me put it that way. Sometimes still came
through. But not — I wasn’t unreasonable any more.
Q: When you came to the United States, did you ever still speak German with

my in-laws were from Germany, my first in-laws, and my second ones, too. And —
and we would speak German when Elaine wasn’t supposed to hear what we were
saying. So she went to her grandma, and she said, Mom, will you teach me
German? And she — my mother-in-law, who was an angel, she said — she said, I
don’t know how to teach, but Pll only speak German to you from now on. And she
did, and that’s how she learned German. Then, when this daughter got married —
was getting married, she took her a-and her future husband to meet my mother-in-
law. And my mother-in-law started speaking German — speaking English with him.
So Elaine said, Mama, I thought you — you always spoke German with me, I didn’t
know you could speak English. And she said, what do you think, I’m an idiot?
Q: What a crusty lady. Wonderful.
A: She was wonderful.

asking questions, and being nasty.
Q: This is the German side?

them. So finally they got us into an old, rickety hotel on the back stairs, going up to
some room, and there were mice there, it was terrible. Every time my sister was
