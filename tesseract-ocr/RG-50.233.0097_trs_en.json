            "answer": "All right. I was born in Poland, October 16, 1923. My family name was Rosenblum, Eugene in Polish, it was Eugeniusz. And I grew up in the city of Lodz. Lodz was an industrial city. It was used to be called Polish Manchester, of about 600,000 inhabitants. Today is about,000,000 people. It was 2\u2122 largest Jewish community in Poland. It was inhabited by about0,000 Jews. It was a vibrant Jewish community. My parents came to Lodz after fleeing Russia. They were married in Russia. My mother was studying at the University in Russia. My father fled Russia with my mother in 1923 during the Gurinsky regime. which was really the forerunner of KGB. They were arresting all the people who were by them the . So my mother went to Lithuania, to the border, 1923, she was pregnant. , she\u2019s going to parents to wait for birth and my father crossed the Russian-Polish boundary and he was wounded by the way the Russians were shooting when they were crossing and arrived in the Polish city of Lodz. My mother joined him. There where I was born. I was born in middle class family. My father . We lived in a very nice section of town."

            "answer": "Notobicuk 41. Well, at that point, I better tell you something about Jewish community in Lodz. It was divided largely three different segments. The Orthodox Jews which occupied section of town. They wore Hasidic garb. That was about 40% of Jewish people in Lodz. That was a large section of the working class people and that was substantial amount of the middle class or upper middle class Jews who were rather prosperous and they lived, for lack of other words, in the nicer part of town. Most of the people lived in apartments. In Poland, you didn\u2019t have the , the land was too expensive so you have big apartment buildings. We had about five or six room apartment and like all of the people who live in this section of town, we have a maid, a live-in maid. We have a girl who came to cook and you always have somebody who came to the door, no washing machine, ever so often and done the wash. I was attending private schools. I was going to Hebrew gymnasium. It was one of the few gymnasiums in Poland from which one could go straight to Polish University with government rights. We didn\u2019t have to pass any exams. At the same time, when they issued the anfamatura which was probably the closest to it in the United States is the regents exams that you get in New York. When they issue the certificate of completion. It was also recognized in the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and you could enter right away the University to pass a special examination. There were three schools, they called it 1S' gymnasium and 2\" gymnasium. They were just across from each other and there was a girls gymnasium. As I grew up, we participate most, most of the children attended the school were members of Zionist organizations. At that time, probably what organization you belonged, it wasn\u2019t determined by your political views because we were just teached at that time but it was determined by the shahim the representative of the kibbutz movement, who was a better organizer was able to attract more children. I belonged to Hashoma Hatsayeer, although my parents were well off, it was left wing organization. Poland by itself, even before Hitler, was anti-Semitic state. When we were going to school, I remember very often we have to cross the so-called people university, and we went through a hail of stones thrown at us. I remember when I was growing up after the dictator of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They were the profession, they were the merchants, they were the manufacturers. After he died, Poland became openly anti-Semitic. When I went to school, oh it was about 15-20 minutes walk, I passed at least five or ten intersections and there was always scribble on the corner, \u201cJews to Palestine\u201d. So, since Poland was verantly nationalistic and they were afraid of Russia, it bordered on hysteria how they were afraid of Communism. Jews, even from affluent home, just as a purpose of what they saw and the atmosphere 1n which they grew up, were drawn to left wing organization. And I find myself Hashoma Hatsayeer where we all realize although we were children and I was fifteen and a half when the war started, we all realize that there is no future in Poland. My parents wanted me to go to France, my father had a brother over there who was manufacturer, a silk manufacturer, he felt he wanted me to go and study in France. Polish Jews were not admitted, there were some Polish University but there were numerous clauses. Numerous clauses mean restricted quota for Jews. It was very hard to get, so most of the Jews went to a university town of Nance near Strasburg and they lost a year. They learned French and they got the degrees there. I was slated to go over there. My childhood was a happy one but we knew there was no future in Poland."

            "answer": "Well, it was maybe in sense of American values. There was on big, great synagogue in Lodz. To Orthodox Jews, it was probably worse than going to a reformed synagogue here. But yet, the women were on the balcony, the men sit on the first floor and my parents attend the high holy days."

We are not a very observant family in the usual standards of Polish Jewry but still I went to Hebrew gymnasium and culturally we were very much Jews but quote, unquote emancipated Jews and not religious Jews. My father belonged to Hartzerarde. In Hebrew this is . That was the . My mother worked as a volunteer for ORT which organization supported the teaching of trades to the Jewish kids who didn\u2019t have the financial means to go to gymnasium. Not that many in Poland, a very small percent of children went to gymnasium. Probably, no more than five or ten percent. By Jews, much larger percent. I cannot put the exact percentage but most of the children did not finish gymnasium. This kids were trained by ORT, they were in dire straits and so forth. Naturally, the religious Jews tried to educate their children in the religious schools, did not have government rights."

As a matter of fact, my father spoke fluently Polish, German and Russian. So did my mother. My mother also spoke French. But to me they spoke Polish. I didn\u2019t know that much Yiddish. I don\u2019t know for the purpose of a background maybe, the Zionist begged the parents not to teach the kids Jewish, to teach Hebrew. I went to Hebrew gymnasium. I learned Yiddish already from my father-in-law a little bit after I got married and in ghetto but no, no, we spoke Polish. We spoke probably Polish better than Poles because the way they were able to recognize that a girl which had Aryan look but was Jewish that she was Jewish. Jews spoke pure Polish without any regional inflection. Almost every Pole had a little This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection bit regional inflection. Our Polish was colorless or classic. So we spoke very well Polish. I liked the language. I don\u2019t like the people but I still like Polish literature, and so forth. But our orientation was very much Zionist, because in our mind there was no other solution to the Jewish problem in Poland but to immigrate; immigration to Israel, to Palestine was restricted so probably most of us knew we would have to go to some countries but Poland was not in our future. When the war started, I was fifteen and a half years old. Polish radio started to broadcast the third or fourth day of war, urgent appeal all men should go in direction of center of Warsaw which is about 120 kilos, that\u2019s from Lodz. Most of the men left. I went together with my father. We reached Warsaw before the Germans were able to lay siege around Warsaw. We lived through the battle of Warsaw. When I returned home, we were not allowed to have a maid. No gentile could work for Jew. But, we still had our apartment. I had a big dog, a Great Dane."

            "answer": "Rex.The dog was seven or eight years old at that time. I remember it was two or three weeks after we returned. It was still probably middle of October or end of October. My mother took all of her jewelry except one small ring off of her hands and somebody knocked on the door. My mother opened and a German, a German non-commissioned officer pushed the door open, grabbed my mother\u2019s hand and tried to take the ring off. He didn\u2019t see the dog. The dog jumped. The dog was 140-130 pounds Great Dane. He went to the floor and he went to his throat. He pointed the gun at my mother and he told to me you won\u2019t take the dog away, Ill shoot your mother. I said \u201cput your gun away and I\u2019ll try to take the dog but don\u2019t move\u201d\u2019. I took the dog away and he told my mother should take her coat, she is going to the criminal police and he will charge that we instigated the dog to attack a German soldier. Well, my mother spoke very well German. She told, \u201call right, I want also to ask if the German soldier is allowed to act as common robbers if all that we have belongs to the German government, you certain of the German government\u2019. Well, after long negotiations, my mother gave him some valuables. He relented but I had to take the dog down and I had to tie him, that was a contraption that was used to beat the rocks, clean the rocks and I had to tie the dog. And he shot the dog. That was the first thing I lost. I was sick for three weeks. That was the first loss of somebody I love. I loved the dog because I grew up with him. Well, things got worse. We were ordered to put Stars of David, the yellow patches in the shape of the star. We wore one on the left breast and one on the back. I said I\u2019m not going to put it on and I went out and I was caught and I was very badly beaten. When I came home, I told my father that I wanted to go to Russia. At that time, to Russia occupied zone. At that time, Russia allowed every few weeks, the people who come there divided demarcation line to cross Russia occupied part of Poland. My father told me he doesn\u2019t have the strength or inclination to go. He said son, you might not realize but to go to Russia 1s one-way ticket. You will be able to get in but you will never be able to get out. I fled from there. I'll take my chances with Germans. And that wasn\u2019t just my father. To them the Russians were the occult Bolsheviks and this and they still felt the Hitler regime was aberration and whatever will happen, they\u2019Il survive the war and things return to normal and they will live in free Europe. So they gave me some valuables and sent me off. My mother told me when I was leaving on my way to Russia, \u201cSon, take a good look at your parents. You will never see them again.\u201d And I went and I was an only child, 16 years old, never away from home except when I went to summer camp. And these words, I could hear the words in my ears to the entire way I reached the Russian boundary and they were supposed to open the day before. I waited for about three or four days. I decided, well whatever is going to happen is going to happen to me and my parents and when I returned, they were already in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The ghetto, I think, was established in the first month, I don\u2019t remember the exact month, sometimes around April of 1940. The ghetto boundaries were already established and the Jews were encouraged to move there. Nobody was moving. At that time, the Russians had deported or repatriated rather, the German population from Latvia, from Volhynia, from the parts of Poland, in particle, they were mostly by Germans, in the states which Russia occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of Jewish apartments as we lived in the nice section of town where one of the parents were to go. Two German officials came and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus . (couldn\u2019t hear) to go, so we went. We were able to get a room in one of the two or three homes which had modern conveniences like water, flush toilets and so forth. The ghetto to which they press around 150,000 -- 160,000 Jews, was occupied before probably by 10,000 -- 15,000 people and that was the worst slums by looting. There were very few buildings which really resembled anything we know before we got the room in one of these buildings. They closed the ghetto and in the beginning it was already no more horrors by the Germans, there were no more beatings, there were no more shootings. The ghetto started to organize itself but almost from the beginning the rations of food became much smaller and we got progressively less and less to eat. I didn\u2019t finish gymnasium before the war. I finish in ghetto. Polish didn\u2019t have right. They forbid Polish to have any kind of schools. They close all Polish schools. Somehow, they probably knew they were going to liquidate the population sooner or later they pay no attention so schools open in ghetto so I finish in ghetto. What happen in ghetto in beginning years, it was a slow starvation. The , aman in his early 60\u2019s, he was a minor official in the Jewish community. He was active in Jewish orphanages. He never had children. He raise quite a bit of money for the orphans. He was one of the few people who didn\u2019t flee when all the men left Lodz and went to Warsaw. When the Germans came and he was there and they told him he 1s the alderman of the Jews. He started to organize Jewish life. The men were already had their blood which he bought by the grave of his wife which was buried there. He was really widening up his ears. Evidently, all the power of the Germans was vested in him. He became absolute ruler of the ghetto and to us he seemed like a man that was drugged with power On the other feeling of course was that if we are going to make useful our services to the Germans, good part of the Jews might survive. No bodies even worst fears believed that the Germans would try to physically annihilate every woman and child. Well, he establish schools. He started to establish so-called \u201carbisin\u201d, they were shops which manufacture various things with the Germans farvartung with the Germans were the people who administer the ghetto brought to the ghetto and they have a large number of people working in the resorts and in exchange they were sending food to the ghetto. What I remember from now on, I was still young but was rather a shielded childhood and we grew up in a hurry. What I remember was hunger, terrible hunger. And it started very, very slowly by the people who were middle aged. And I say people after 40, 45. They had started to deprive. More and more you saw people who had swollen feet, swollen hands. The winters are very harsh in Poland and there was nothing to heat their apartments with or the rooms with. There was very little even wood or coal briquettes to be able to cook something. People were very hungry. A lot of them tried to crumble the bread and cook the bread and make a soup out of this so that physically they could pacify their hunger pangs. But, they consumed a lot of liquid and the heart was not able to pump and the water settled in the feet and people started to die out. And we had 60, 70 funerals a day. 50 funerals a day will be 1,500 people a month. That was in the beginning. In the beginning, the funerals resembles more or less which were held before the war but sooner or later there was only mass grave. Well, like a mass grave, one mount under the other unmarked graves. My father was taken 1941 to Gestapo. They had the registers. (can\u2019t understand). He came very badly beaten and he died a few weeks later. I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Things got even worse as far as the food was concerned. But yet the younger people organize themselves, called Self-Help Organization. The morale was, well, we still felt that we had a chance to survive. This had changed in 1942. In 1942, the runcoston hada assembly. It\u2019s 92, 50 years before and I still remember. He said to us, he stand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he organized orphanages even un ghetto and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as he could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews. Jews over years old and children under 10. He told us, you have a choice. Our police would take them and it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it would be much worse. If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked up in the ghetto want to survive, they have to give up 20,000. Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we all go. And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no. Yet, they declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their homes and the Jewish police went from house to house and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections. All the sickly people and the older people and the children were taken away. But what the Jewish police did was not good enough for Germans and they came. Some people were shot. They tore the children from the mothers\u2019 arms. They beat the people. The mothers who resisted were shot on the spot. In most cases, the women remained frozen when the Germans took the children away. Only when the child was already on the horse drawn wagon, they realize what happen, they start to chase and cry. Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people. And from then on, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work. The food supply didn\u2019t improve -- deteriorate, more and more. There was a lot of mismanagement, in ghetto. He tried Rumkoski tried to store some of the potatoes, you know, which were supposed to be rationed to the population. And the whole thing, the entire crop got spoiled. In 1942, I think,43, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as much valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so called sondokommando. He tried to bring some order to the ghetto. In a way he did. He made the thing look a little more efficient. In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more were given and people were left in apartments. 3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when you walk the streets of the ghetto 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call mussermench, because the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim. The people became living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and you could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end soon, they are going to die. Well, the ghetto lived until 1944."

People tried to avoid deportation as long as they could. I left Lodz in August 23 1944. We didn\u2019t know where we go. Probably if we would know where we go and what Auschwitz is, we would get vicious to board the trains and probably shot, but that would be at least passive resistance but we really didn\u2019t know."

We knew that clothes came back to the ghetto from the people who were deported, the old and the sick people and people had foreboding that nothing good comes and they probably perish but they didn\u2019t know that systematic extermination and this.

So, when we boarded the train, there were 100 people in our, whatever you call this, and what they gave us, there was one bucket which was supposed to serve if people wanted to relieve themselves. There was no water. A little bit of food we took with. I think it took us about four days out to reach Auschwitz. We came at night. We were allowed to take hand baggage. When the doors opened, we saw people pointing to us looked like a fine striped pajamas uniforms. But they spoke to us Polish and told us, \u201cplease leave all the things inside the car. Just get out, get out, get out.\u201d Before we could do anything else, we form a line, we saw a lot of SS running with the pistols and with guns, whipping people and we were marching top a well lighted platform and Mengele was standing there and conducted the selection. And with a flip of the hand, some went to the right, some went to the left. We had no idea what it means. I went to the right. They took us, they took all the clothes away, they shave us completely and they give us the striped uniforms and a number and we were led to a barracks. Barrack that were former quarters of Austrian cavalry from before WWI and when you slept over there you could lay down on one side but we were pressed so much that there was no place to turn around. I still have, 50 years, I have scars about size of half dollar because we were all bones at that time and laying and pressing, the bones were pressing against the wood and the things got infected. I was about two weeks -- I wasn\u2019t in Auschwitz, I was in Birkenau. Birkenau was part of Auschwitz complex but there was, people didn\u2019t work over there. People were either sent to the gas chamber, either sent out to other German concentration camps at that time. You could see when we went to the barrack, the flames shooting and the block leader told us what it is, that the people from the selections are having appointment with their forefathers. Well, anyway, I was there for two weeks and I was selected and put into a transport and I met one of my former classmates, Jerry Malikoff and we decided that we stick together. And we were, together, almost to the end of the war. We were deported to the commander of Dachau. That was a separate camps of Dachau. Dachau was much minor camp in comparison. . There were just camps in which the Jews worked until they dropped dead and they send us more and more and more people..

We stood on the appell platz, that was the place where they counted the prisoners and the number of the prisoners had to tally, even if we stood late in the night. I was lucky for a short while to get the job . Then they used us to take care of other prisoners. When you are sick, when you get your slice of bread you couldn\u2019t eat everything and there was a lot of bread left. At that time, I gained some weight but after a while the Germans got tired of it and they took away with the transport all the sick people, the block was liquidated and we went back."

My wife went to nursing school and he was director of nursing school after the war. He attended our wedding He told me, you come son, I have to amputate or you die. And they didn\u2019t have no anesthetics and he told me \u201cbut look, you\u2019ll be in pain but you\u2019ll faint\u2019. And few people put me on the table, they help me and I just realize at that moment that they are going to take away the toes of my foot. They are going to amputate, I\u2019Il be sent away to the gas chambers. So with all the strength I have, I tore myself out and I run away. I run away and I went to the working detail. At that time, I had no feeling in my foot and I must have stepped on a very sharp stone and it cut deeply but that saved me and the pus and everything started to drain. After the war I still had operation and I had pieces of bone taken out of my toes but I survived this. When the Allies started to come in and they started to come in direction of Dachau from Ausborg, which was miles away, they put us all on the trains. Then they started to gather all the prisoners into the main camp in Dachau, although we were probably no more than twenty, thirty miles to Dachau, everything wass bombed, and I was in transit for about four or five days. There was no water, there was no food. Some people went crazy and they drank their own urine. When my train came to Dachau, they unloaded boxcar. They unloaded my boxcar. That was the last boxcar they unloaded. There were more dead than alive and when the American army came two days later, they found the entire train, say the first five boxcars, boxcars full of dead prisoners. Well, and what the Americans done -- they put us. I was in the hospital for quite a few months and I decided to go back to Poland to see if anyone had survived. We had, during the war, when we knew that they are going to take our apartment away, that sooner or later we had to move to ghetto, we had neighbors. Their name was Mitchelene, they were Poles. He was, the father of the man was Italian and the mother was Polish but they lived in Poland and we knew them very, very well. As a matter of fact, the woman was carrying , my mother was carrying her . I knew the people for fourteen years, from the time I moved in the house to the time I was deported. My mother took all the crystals, all the china, all the silver up to them and said, \u201cLook, I doubt if we will get alive from the ghetto. That\u2019s all yours.\u201d We survived. We didn\u2019t expect. Well, I went over there when I came. I went with the transport to Poland, Polish transport of course, repatriated to Poland, it was very easy to get on the train. I came over there, I went on the tenth floor. I knocked on the door. A woman opened the door and she tried to slam in my face. \u201cWe have nothing, we have nothing.\u201d I was just able to hold the door open and I said \u201clook, I don\u2019t want nothing from you.

I got married in 1948. My wife was in nursing school at that time. We came here. Well, my story is for all the people who came displaced persons, who came to this country. We worked for a couple of years and then I went back to school. I got my PhD from medical school from the University of Chicago and came to Washington, started with the government. For the last ten years before retirement, I directed the research department that was the only large animal where my medical research was conducted. I retired in 1989."

            "question": "Before the war, during the war, episodes that stand out? I know you told me a number of them.",
            "answer": "Episodes that stands in my mind was the deportation in 1942. It was a nightmare. The cries of the people; the children torn from the mother\u2019s arms. The old people who went in such a resigned way, with the look in their eyes -- they know that that\u2019s their last trip. They didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them. But they knew that that\u2019s the end. That was one. The second was the shock of coming to Auschwitz. The selection. The realization. The flames that were shooting toward the sky when we were told that all the people who went to the left side were selected by Mengele. This probably I remember still most deeply. I saw Mengele for about ten minutes. Pass the line until I pass him by. I probably, if he would look like he looked then, I would recognize him immediately. The other thing which I remember was the will to live. People wanted to survive. People wanted to survive. They wanted to tell the story. We never believed at that time that the world really know what\u2019s happening to us. People were clinging to their lives and they wanted to preserve something. The other thing, I never attended synagogue till my daughter was born and she was about six or seven years old, we lived in Chicago. One day, , she came \u201cDaddy, Daddy, look, sisters are coming\u201d\u2019. I said what are you mumbling, what sisters? I look and I saw two nuns. And I said, \u201cJudy, tomorrow you go to Sunday School.\u201d And I took her to Sunday school. But it took years for us to reconcile and regain some kind of emotional balance although we are outwardly very, very well balanced, but the whole coming to the United States, trying to work, trying to get degree. Well, people were really subconsciously trying to do, they try to do that many things, that they went finally to sleep, they collapse. There was no time to think. It was, I don\u2019t know, I know there was no neurotic drive, only that there was self- preservation. But people tried, not to forget, but people simply were haunted. It was almost in everybody\u2019s mind, the question, people question \u201cWhy did I survive? Why didn\u2019t the other one survive?\u201d And you know what was probably the most painful question was when you talk to people and they didn\u2019t meant nothing. We did hear, just very innocently asking, \u201cWhy and how did you survive?\u201d We couldn\u2019t -- it helped them. We couldn\u2019t answer the question ourselves but people felt guilty without being able to explain to themselves that they are not guilty of nothing and it took number of years. It took quite a few years until, you know, the children came and life went on, and we\u2019re young and the things which happened receded and accepting from God then, life went on and we raised families and we became part of American society. And I hope we contributed."

She traveled. As a matter of fact, my mother was in the United States attending the World Fair in 1939. She came to see her brothers. When she returned to Poland two weeks before the war started, her brother begged her to stay but you know, she said \u201clook, I have a child and my husband over there.\u201d When she crossed Germany, the train was seeing, nobody could get, you know, she just transited into Germany, into Poland. If the war had broken out two weeks earlier, I would still have probably my mother alive. I remember in 1938, Germans expelled the Jews who were once Polish citizens. We were not at that far from the border. Lodz, I don\u2019t know, maybe two, three hundred miles from the border, from the western border in Germany. We kept a young boy and I shared the room for a while, I don\u2019t remember, for half a year."

She lived in a small town in Lithuania, Batinia, Lithuania. My grandfather was very well to do. He owned quite a bit of land. He owned a sawmill. He owned a flourmill ad my grandparents sent us packages in 1941 to the ghetto from Lithuania. The packages reached the ghetto. They were killed -- the Lithuanians killed them even before the Germans. In the two to three days when the Russians pulled away and before the Germans occupied physically the town, the entire Jewish population was finished."

And probably just like today\u2019s generation of the people veer from the strict religious practices of their parents, they veer from the strict religious practices of their parents. In other words, the meat was kosher still at home but when we ate dinner, we could have coffee or tea with milk, you know. It was kosher but not in the strictest sense of this.

We\u2019re not bitter at nobody in particular.

When I came here, you see this is the difference probably between the immigration, between the displaced persons who came here at that time. We spent very little, just wanted a chance. Russian Jews, and I quite active now with Russian Jews, they expect much more. They expect much from society. We were so disillusioned, that we didn\u2019t expect nothing from nobody. But, yes, I have contact with them, but I lived in Chicago, they lived in L.A. I saw them a few times. As a matter of fact when I got out from undergraduate school in Annapolis, his wife came to my graduation. My wife has a family in Chicago. They showed us when we came. They are not wealthy people but the children were pretty well off. They\u2019re professionals and we got quite close to them.
