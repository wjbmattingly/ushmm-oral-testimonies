A: So you — you — you are used to almost nothing.
Q: It’s very hard for people who have not been reduced to almost nothing, to know
what it’s like. And I suspect it’s very hard to have words to put to that experience.
A: We were in the army, I told you [indecipherable] there, watching those
prisoners. It was winter. For three months we didn’t had nothing to eat. No —
nobody cared to get — get to us, so we finally yu — saw a field where the farmers
took off their cabbage. Was no cabbage there, the roots. We dig it out the roots,
nothing wash it [indecipherable] shanell(ph), they call shanell(ph) the uniform
[indecipherable] this is the soldier.
Q: Wow.
A: [indecipherable] they just couldn’t understand, they thought that somebody
make up story. Or — or like my brother [indecipherable] you know, the showers.
Forget about shower [indecipherable] we had a — not a hole, a piece of stone over
there, with a couple blankets hanging, they’re outside a fire. You put snow, and
from the snow we get steam. And this was our shower. You didn’t get sick, you
went without shoes, without the winter. This were your shower. Could you believe
it? No.
Q: No.

Interview with Paul Jonas ”
May 3, 2013
A: [indecipherable] remember?
Q: What was it like when you live in the United States? Does it — did it ever feel
lonely that there wasn’t anybody you could talk about these things to? Or that —
who’d understand. Not that you’d need to talk about it, but who could understand
it.
A: Only the foreigner, who went through more or less the same thing, will
understand, yeah. Not from the other side. This was paradise. It was — here, when
we came, we just couldn’t believe it, we had the — we couldn’t believe it, we are
talking with a nice human being, you know. Thank God. Food all over. You don’t
have to stay in line, like you used to.
Q: That’s right.
A: You used to stay in lines for hours, and then they haven’t got any more. Like I —
I —I love watermelons. I says, for one week or two weeks I was living only on
watermelons. I had no money, I had nothing to buy [indecipherable] the
watermelons were growing over there, just growing, you know, wild. And this the
only food what I ate.
Q: Do you think — are there — well, here’s a — a question that’s a little provocative.
Do you think that there are people who endured the Holocaust, who were never
close to Russia at all, who don’t understand what you went through?

A: I’m sure there are plenty of it. For one reason that I — I-I-I tried to understand, 1s
it true? I — I start not to believe what [indecipherable] look at me, and I’m still
here, and I have a office, with kid, with children. How could I live? But yeah — I
mean, you start to think, you go [indecipherable] details. You went through more
than y-you could take, you know.
Q: Do you have — do you have — sometimes Russian Jews who have emigrated to
the United States have felt alienated because people haven’t understood their
experiences. There’s — I’m talking in the 70s, in the 80s, and the 90s and so on. Do
you think there’s something to that?
A: The worst thing 1s, if you can’t share with nobody. It’s always, you know,
locked in the — in the — and you ask yourself what has happened [indecipherable]
is it true? Some years, are you still alive, you know”? So it’s very hard to tell my
kids. Okay, sure [indecipherable]. You can’t. If you don’t go through, you don’t
understand, yeah. Same thing with a patient, if you never have pain, oh yeah, don’t
worry about it, couple minutes you’ll be finish. For you a couple minutes, but the
patient is suffering couple hours.
Q: Yeah.
A: Yeah. And same thing [indecipherable] not expected to understand.

who does it for you.
Q: So it strengthened your belief?
A: Yes, yes, yes, more, more.

miracle than God. Somebody higher and stronger than me helped me to go through
this. Wha — two slices of bread a day for two years or three years? Working
