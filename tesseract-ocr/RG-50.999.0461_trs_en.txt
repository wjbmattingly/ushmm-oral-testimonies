>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson, host of the museum's program First Person. Thank you for
joining us. We are in our 15th year of the First Person program. Our First Person today is
Mr. Morris Rosen whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the
Louis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein
Foundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who
share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our
First Person guests serves as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue
through mid-August. The Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides information about
each of our upcoming First Person guests. Anyone interested in keeping touch with the
Museum and its programs can complete the Stay Connected card in their program, which is
this one, or speak with a museum representative at the back of the theater after our program
today. In doing so you will also receive an electronic copy of Morris Rosen's biography so that
you can remember and share his testimony after you leave here today.

Morris will share with us his First Person account of his experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time at the end of our program,
we'll have an opportunity for you to ask Morris a few questions. We have prepared a brief
slide presentation to help with his introduction.

We begin with a portrait of Morris Rosen, who was born Moniek Rozen, son of Jakub

Rozen and Golda Chaya Warszawski in 1922. Morris was born in Dabrowa Gornicza in
Upper Silesia, where his father was a distributor of tobacco and Acetylene. The arrow points
to the location of Dabrowa.

Here we have a 1924 portrait of one of Morris' sisters, Rozia Rozen Bilauer, who
survived in the USSR during the war.

This photograph is of Morris and his friends on a hillside of Dabrowa. Morris is at
the top of the photo.

As you will hear, Morris survived several Nazi camps. After a six-week forced march
he arrived in the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. The arrow points to the
location of Buchenwald.

Eventually, in 1945, Morris was liberated from the Theresienstadt camp in occupied
Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Army.

We close this brief slide presentation with a photograph of Morris with Regina
Zilberstein whom he met after the war. We might hear more about her if time allows this
morning.

Morris came to the United States in 1949 and following seven years of art school
built a successful contracting business in Baltimore where he lives today. He is well-known as
a stamp, postcard, and letter collector, especially for his Holocaust Postal History collection,
including those from Nazi-created ghettos in Poland. He is also recognized worldwide for his
collection on the Olympics and has traveled and lectured about his collection as part of the
Olympic Games. He has exhibited at numerous U.S. and international exhibitions, including

the Nuremburg, Germany. He donated several items of his collection to this museum.

Morris speaks frequently about his Holocaust experience at such places as the
headquarters in the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid,
and the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Fort Mead, Maryland. He speaks to
numerous students at Baltimore area schools and other locations. He will speak at Johns
Hopkins University, for example, this Friday.

Morris was named the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. Man of the Year for the
American Red Cross. Morris, who lost his wife in 2000, has two sons and two grandchildren.

And finally, | think you should know in addition to gardening, Morris works out three
times a week doing Zumba, which combines Latin and international music with dance as an
exercise program. He told me he's now added to that another form of dance and exercise
which is even more vigorous than Zumba. He also mentioned to me that he is the only male in
either class. Morris' doctor ordered him to no longer go on his steep roof to clean the gutter
and do repairs.

With that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Morris
Rosen.
>> Bill Benson: Morris, good morning.
>> Morris Rosen: Thank you, Mr. Benson, for your eloquent introduction. Hello and good
morning everybody. It is difficult to condense ideas of the darkest of mankind history into one
hour. | wouldn't have enough in one day what | lived through in five years. | will do my best.
But | might have to skip a year or two.

>> Bill Benson: Start, if you don't mind, Morris, by telling us just a little bit about your family
and your community before the war began.
>> Morris Rosen: | lived with my family. | have a large family; eight children, my parents. We
lived very nice with the gentile people. Our store was mostly 99% gentile people. But things
changed in 1939. The war started out September 1, 1939.

| woke up in the morning, such a noise from the airplanes. | looked out the window
and there were about 60 of them. | counted them. | was surprised. | didn't know they were
German. A lot of people went out to hear what the noise was. Then | found out that the war
started out and the planes went out.

The fifth column out in civilian clothing, with walkie-talkie, they could report
everything to the enemy what's going on, where the Polish Army is, how many they have there
in the Army, what kind of equipment they have. So on and so on.
>> Bill Benson: Just so we understand, the fifth column was the name given to people of
German decent who were living in Poland and now were providing all the information to the
German Army.
>> Morris Rosen: Not this. They spoke Polish. Some of them were caught. They were hung,
all naked. They were not in uniforms. So they hung them.

When | escaped --
>> Bill Benson: You and your brother were warned to run away.
>> Morris Rosen: We were warned to run away from the Germans, that they were chased out
in Germany. They came to our city. They came in. The war started Friday. The sky was all

red from all the artillery and everything to run away. We ran away.

But the Germans, after six days, they caught us. So the first came, four motorcycles
with machine guns. They said, “Refugees.” So one of the German guys says, ok, we can go
home, in beautiful German. He says, “How do we know so well German?” | says, “Well, |
went to the university, I'm a German.” Says, wait, we can't do nothing. But the end of the
column from the soldiers, they would take. That's what happened.

When we came home, finally, after four days, walking back home, we found out that
so many Jews were killed already on the way going home. That's what started out. And right
away, occupied the 3rd of September. Only three days. It's only, by car, 20 minutes from the
German border.

Right away, we can't meet any more than two, three people. Jews have to walk on
the street, not on the pavement. And schools were closed up. Anybody caught with weapons
or something, we would be punished by death. It was very bad.

After 6:00 in the evening until 7:00 in the morning, nobody could walk on the street.
lt doesn't make any difference. It was very difficult.

Then came orders right away. | skipped a little bit. This was already in
November 1939. Just the search, still bloody from the battles because put up 30-day battle.
More than any other European country. And they started out right away with Jews, they have
to wear arm bands. We have to wear, first, white arm bands on the left hand, Star of David.
Later on we changed because where we lived, Upper Silesia, was incorporated into the
general itself. So we have the same laws as the Germans. And we have to write letters -- you

have to write everything in German. We have the German money, not the government money,
the Polish money, still. It was very difficult. We have to stay in line only for Jewish bakeries.
Only two bakeries. It was very, very difficult. But this was not the worst.

Then came the order. Jews have to deliver in so much gold, so much silver, in order
to pay for the German Army, for the occupation. People didn't have any gold or anything. It
was really we were about only 5% Jews in our city. We had 5,000 only. And there was 50,000
Pols. Who had gold? They had to give away their rings. You have to buy gold. You have to
deliver so much and so much. And this was not the worst.

Then came another order. | skipped some. People had to live so many Jews,
young people to work and they have to work for the Germans. So they start building
community there. We have to do everything what the German wants. And in order to get a
little bit more food -- and of course, my father had to pay some money -- that | should work with
my father in the bauleitung, the building.

First, you have especially ID cards that with you could walk on the street. We
already worked for the Germans, so they shouldn't catch us in the street or send away to
Germany. That's what they did at that time. And we had a little additional food, also.

My first job was | became a carpenter, a painter, and a bricklayer. All| did. My first job,
unfortunately, was in the market to put up hanging scaffolds for 10 people. | said this is wrong.
>> Bill Benson: To make the hanging scaffolds.
>> Morris Rosen: Yes. The next day police rather than around -- not soldiers but the German
police, they took away IDs from every person, Jew, not Jew, Pols, we have to come on the

market 10: 30 in the morning. You get back to IDs. If you don't come that day, you won't get
IDs, you won't get food stamps.

So of course, the market was packed. We wait. They had a truckload with 10 Pols.
They wore masks. They committed things against the government, which it's not true. They
were condemned for hanging. And the thing what | saw there, the screams from them, "Long
live Poland," "Take revenge." And this they did in every city in Poland just to make sure that
nobody does sabotage. And they were picked up from the Polish foundry in our city, which the
locomotives for the tanks were built there for the war. And during the war they made parts for
airplanes. This was the first experience.

Then | have to skip to 1942. They started out a ghetto. Nobody could go out for the
ghetto except with a special permanent. Like | work only for the Germans, | was free to go
everywhere with my special ID card.

Came an order that all the girls between 12 years and 25 have to register that
they're going to be working in the shop, potato shop there. And they have special IDs. But the
thing was wrong. They came to the Jewish community there where 450, all the young
generation in our city, Jewish girls, and came there and said send them to work. They took
them to a transition camp. We found out where they are. So my father went there. He
thought he knows people, he can take you out. Nobody could tell. They took the girls and
shipped them away. We didn't know where.

You can imagine our home, a 12-year-old girl, it was like coming home after a
funeral. My mother was crying. My father showed the bitterness. Everybody was terrible.

And finally, after two weeks, we found out -- we got first postcard that she works in Lower
Silesia in a factory where they make materials. She works 12 hours with the machine walking
forward and back and gives to levenstein.

We understood they were the two Jewish bakeries that they could only bake bread
for the Jews. The Jews couldn't buy any other place bread. So my mother baked up whatever
she could. It wasn't easy until you got some flour on the back market, which wasn't allowed.
You got caught, you get shot. She made out some packages. It was allowed to send once a
month a package. And | went to the post office because mine ID, could walk everywhere
because | worked for the highest, highest German officials that existed in Silesia, only for
them. This was not the worst.

Came August 12, 1942, again came order: Every Jew has to register near the
Jewish community, to be there at 5:00 in the morning. And you know in August how hot tt is in
Poland. 5:00 with the rest of the families. We are going to get new IDs. You don't get IDs,
you won't get any -- and the Jewish community, either way, the head of the Jewish community
put up clothing, look presentable. We were there 5:00 in the morning. The heat was
unbearable. Kids were crying. People were panting from thirst. You couldn't go out until
8:00 in the morning.

8:00 in the morning, said to myself, oh, something doesn't look right. | saw soldiers
with machine guns on the roofs all around the community. Then came two trucks with SS and
a commission which at that time | worked for the highest official from the SS that was
responsible for sending out the Jews, Auschwitz, which | don't know what Auschwitz meant at

the time. We didn't Know, but he was responsible. There should be no Jews in the cities no
more in all Silesia. | worked for him at the time.

When | was there, they put up tables and everybody, the head of the family have to
Stay first. The elder people, like over 45, go to the right. To the left were the ones with IDs,
that | worked for them, to the left. And the center were youngsters, barely able to walk. But
they don't have IDs yet. It took until 10:00. 10:00 they got all the Jews to the right: women,
children, men, and they chased them to Bedzin.

We didn't have the keys to the house or anything. My father had everything. Then
we had to sleep outside. We couldn't get into our apartment. In the morning | found out where
they are. | went on foot. | didn't want to take the street car, though | had a special ID. | was
afraid. It wasn't too far, about a half-hour | was there in the next city.

Come there. It was only Jewish police there guarding them. | came up, and | saw
they didn't let me in. | said, “Il don't have the key.” And | saw they want Jewish policemen from
our city. | only need to take the keys. Take only a minute. And when | came up, | saw the
scene at the top | will never forget in my life. People were tearing their hair out. They knew
what's going on. And my father gave me the keys to the house, gave me his pocket watch.
My mother cried. He says don't forget my sister who was already in camp. This is the last
time | saw her.

| came back to work right away. | went to the same one. And my older brother and
myself walked there. We tell them we walk here, you can take our parents back? Oh, | find
them. Like you find them like he did. He didn't care much.

On the third day, | walked home separate and my brother. We shouldn't be all in
one place. | didn't go to the city home but to the field. | came to the field there and | see -- one
waived to me. His son was my best friend. And | waived back. So | saw that this was a
transport going away. | didn't know where. So there was police, SS, on the top of the train.
They started shooting at me because | waived. There was a ravine, so | jumped in. Lucky me,
| jumped in there. | waited 10 minutes. Then | went home.

| went home. We didn't even have time to cry. This was just before the high
holidays. We got the sense that we got to move into the ghetto. Our part of the city didn't go
to the ghetto yet. We went to the ghetto. There was only youngsters left for prayers, nobody
to pray. Who prayed? We cried.

Somebody looked at police. So they gave us one little room, 16 people. Nine girls
and seven boys. A little room. The poor section of our city. No floor. So we have to get some
straw to put down for the girls. And one of the women was like a distant cousin. She was
pregnant. Yes, at that time. And we slept on the outside. When it rained, we stood in the
foyer because we didn't even have room to turn around. And what could you take? We didn't
have work. We took our books and so on. He was a collector of these items; some bedding,
some clothing. The rest we have to leave the house everything what it is. You couldn't take
with us.
>> Bill Benson: I'm going to jump in for a minute. The one thing that | think you hung on to
were some photographs.
>> Morris Rosen: Yes.

>> Bill Benson: Tell us about keeping your photographs as long as you -- you still had your
photographs.
>> Morris Rosen: | still have all the photographs. This will come later. No, this | had.
Photographs, about 200 photographs. And still from my first girlfriend that | have in a different
city. | kept this right in front of it, with my family pictures, organizations, everything.

Then we came to the ghetto. Like | told you, we slept outside when it rains; inside
we stood. After one week only | get invitation from the Jewish community. They handed me
tickets for the train with a special pass on the train and go to Szczakowa, a leather factory. |
went to the train. | took all my pictures. That's all | took, and some things. And | came there,
but on the train | noticed one girl and neighbor. She was the daughter of the principal from the
school. And she shook like | shouldn't come over to her or nothing. | noticed she had a
Jewish kid that she took somewhere probably for hiding. | came there. It was a leather
factory. And all we have to eat was dry food, what the Jewish community sent us and bread. |
was picked with another guy because | spoke very good Polish. And we went once a week to
the bakery. We got bread, about 60 breads for the week for us.

And suddenly, after two weeks, we didn't get any more food there. So what
happened, SS came 5:00 in the morning for us. We went a day before a church. And from the
church | hear a whistle come over. Was a Jewish guy hiding. He says: Leave the breads
here. | know who you are. We are going to go through the church. Nobody knows we are
here. The Polish woman, she bring you food. | said no; the people are starving. We have to
take the bread. Maybe tomorrow. But 5:00 in the morning the SS came for us.

What happened? It was no more Jews in all Silesia. Everybody was transported.
No Jews at all.

So my partner, electrician, very fine, intelligent guy, he was missing. He went with
me for bread. He probably jumped out the window and probably went to the church. But |
don't think he survived. Otherwise | would have found him after the war.

Ok. We come there, came SS for us. There was a young woman about 23 years
old. Her husband was the only Jewish engineer there. They couldn't lose him because he
was the only engineer that knew everything. But he went to see his brother. He didn't come
back. So there was no more Jews.

The police took us. His wife, a young woman with a young kid, 2 years old only, |
helped her carrying the baby. She took her suitcase. And then | have pictures that | found
while | worked for the SS men. We got on the third floor to put up heavy cases. And one case
broke. It was so heavy. Pictures came out. And all the pictures were Jews hanging, burning
synagogues, all over Poland. This was ready to be shipped to Germany. We quick put back.
But a couple of pictures, when | came for the next one, | know | hid them. And these pictures |
was afraid to keep. | would get killed if they found them. | told SS | need to go to the
bathroom outside the station. And | threw it in the toilet. Not to be caught.

And lucky me that when we came to Sosnowiec, | gave her the baby; otherwise it
was waiting on the car there. They took letter with the baby. If | would hold the baby, | would
go along with her. They were killed in Auschwitz. | would be the father.

Our job was to empty out the ghetto there in Sosnowiec where all the Jews were in

the last days. On a separate mountain, led on a separate mountain every day. We worked
there 12 hours a day cleaning up. We came back. We slept on cement. Not even straw. We
got a slice of bread and a coffee.

On the third day came out, an SS officer, Ludwig, high officer. Is anybody painter
here? I'm 17 years old, skinny as can be. He's going to kill me. One of the guys said oh, the
Rosen's a painter. He calls me over. “Are you a painter?” | told him, “I'm the best painter. I'm
very good painter.” [Speaking German] Like to a dog you talk. He gave me right away in the
face. | start the bleeding from the nose. Ok. | felt a little better. | came to myself and | told
him, “I don't have no paint. | don't have no brushes. If you leave me there” -- | have
everything. | thought maybe | can escape there. You will have everything. He took two SS
men. They went to work. | stood two SS men and took to a paint store. We took paints,
everything. They helped me move the furniture, everything.

Before | went, he took out his pistol to my temple and says | have three rooms to
paint and three days. If I'm not finished, [Inaudible]. | painted at that time. | was sure this was
the end. | came to myself. And then when | went to the store. | came there. Who was there?
He had the mistress. She looked like a movie star; young, young Polish woman, tall, blond,
about 23, 24 years old. And that Nazi wasn't any taller than | am. Really. She didn't give me
not even hot water. My stomach was growling. | was: What kind Pol is she? She sees I'm
hungry. | woke her up.

So what happened, | worked the first room, the dining room, the chandelier. So |

Next day, | started second room. Who comes, Ludwig with the smile. Oh, he was
pleased. He calls me over. “How old are you?” | told him I'm going on 17. “When did you
learn so good to paint, the way how you paint is so beautiful?” So | tell him -- you're a
businessman. | told my father was the best painter in the city. We didn't have what to eat.
When | was 6 years old instead of going to school, | had to work with my father. So we have to
eat. So that's why | went to work. | never had any school. He went away, comes back a half
an hour late with a big bag, hands it to me. [Speaking German] Don't get caught with it. He's
got life and death | shouldn't get caught with it. He walked away.

over with papers, nobody take away. And the rest | took for my buddies, more half a loaf

me to this camp to be with my sister? [Speaking German]

It's a woman's camp. First | go to a transition camp. | won't tell anything. Too hard
to mention. Then about a week later came a transport to go to Gruenberg. | am not on the list.
| Knew where he went in. | am not on the list. So | jumped over the fence. It wasn't electrified.
| Knocked at the door. And what a picture. He laid in his only underpants, no shirt, no pants,
but his boots. [Speaking German]

| said, you promised me I'm going to Gruenberg. I'm not on the list. “Das?” | went
like a little doggy behind him to the fence. He tore up the list. Nobody goes.

So what happened, | found out, there was one Jew, Dr. Lieberman, he went over to
Christianity in the 1930's. And he became the biggest anti-Semitic. He wrote semitic papers in
Poland. But by the Germans he was considered a Jew. And he was there in that camp. So
they says, well, you think you are better person? You're stilla Jew. He got such a beating
every day. It was only Jewish couples. Only Jews. He was bloody all over. He paid so much
there to go out from here because he knew he was going to get killed there. And he took my
place. That's what happened. But we only went three people went to Gruenberg.

Came on the train, everybody from the train has to go off because a Jew can't be
with the Germans together. Took about two hours on train. We came to Gruenberg. Who
was with it? The eldest of the Jews in the transition camp, very handsome, tall, yes. Anda

woman, a Czech woman from Prague. She became a Christian also.

We arrived there. They brought about 18 Jews, men, from another camp they
closed up also in Gruenberg. So in order to see my sister | have to go through to the doctor.
So the first day after work they let me in there. And | saw my sister every day. | didn't -- right
away when | came there, they took away my clothing and they gave me two new suits. We
worked with the Germans together. Two new shirts. You have to be shaved, your hair
combed. Because worked with the Germans together. Beautiful suits, | tell you.

And there was a nice, little old man, old German. So he said to me -- a painter. He
was a painter helper. [Speaking German] Don't worry, |am a Communist. Watch out for the
dog. The boss he is an SS. | should watch out for him. He brought me every day like a little
piece of bread. | don't have much. And a pill he says is a vitamin. But on Mondays he
brought me -- Sunday his wife baked something, brought me a piece. | had it good there.

We have our office where it was office of six girls working. So one of the women,
about 30, | would say, says, oh, sweet, take out the garbage. | take the garbage out. |
shouldn't throw out everything. | should watch. | come there. It was packed nice, a roll with
butter, with the egg, and a piece of cheese. And every day she gave me this. And right away |
went up to my sister. She started that | would paint. She would eat the paint. Bult, it didn't
last long.

After six months, Ludwig came. Don't like when Ludwig comes. Something's wrong.
We didn't go to work. We stood there, all in a circle. “Where's my Rosen? Where's my
painter?” | came up. “Did you see your sister?” | says, “| saw my sister and | will never forget

you all my life.” He started smiling. When he left, we went to work. Come back from work.
The main SS man in the camp: “Rosen” -- | should come to his office. | should sit down. He
brought me loaf of bread. “Every day you come to my office.” That's what Ludwig told him to
do. But it didn't last long.

Two weeks later we couldn't be anymore with the women there because it became a
concentration camp. And they took us on trucks, two trucks, 80 people. We come there. It
was winter time. Cold as can be in February. And came like a white animal. He was dressed
in leather pants, leather jacket, with the beret and with the scar like this. And he started hitting
left and right: Get, quick, get quick out from the trucks. We formed a circle. And he said if you
have watches, money, diamonds, money, you put everything in the center out. He grabbed
two guys, stepped on their throats and killed them. That's how we're going to look.

pushed them into the snow.
>> Bill Benson: This camp that you're at now was a subcamp of Auschwitz.
>> Morris Rosen: No. Not Auschwitz. It was the main camp in Silesia. Lower Silesia. And
this was Kretschamberg. They took everything away with the suitcase, with my pictures. All |
have is the pictures. So | knew which they put in.

2:00 in the morning, it was pouring raining. There was no electricity. Because
where we came into the barrack, there was no windows yet. The cement was still wet. No
straw, anything. They just put a bucket to relieve yourself. That's all.

So suddenly one day comes a boy after walking with a slice of bread and soup.
Somebody gave me the soup. Who is it? Mr. Bossman. This is the lady was with me in
camp. This was her husband that sent the packages. He knew me very well. He was our

Right away they took the can filled in the other. We don't need. | says, “I'm hungry.” “Don't
worry, you have plenty to eat. Give it to everybody.”

We came there to the camp. It was a new camp there, a new hospital that they
brought wounded soldiers from the Russian front. We painted the hospital. Three painters.
They were not even painters. They didn't know about paint. Helpers. A painter was a
German. Then he came there.

So right away they made a fire. Baked potatoes there. The boss came because
after Sunday he brought everybody a piece of cake. He didn't know at the time. And gave
room to paint, which they thought I'm going to paint the whole day, the whole week. | painted
in a couple of hours because | was a painter. Why are you doing it so fast? The boss came
in. “Who did that?” “I did it.” “Oh, you are a real painter?” | says, yeah, | can mix colors and
everything.

Well, let me tell you, we painted the halls there. All this has to be moved out. And
every soldier has a cabinet with food. We helped ourselves. One was near the door. We
didn't eat bread and butter but butter and bread, eggs, chocolate, cigarettes. We stole
cigarettes to give to the guys outside. Then | filled up a whole bucket with food, garbage,

It came February 5, 1945. The Russian Army were very close. So they said we
don't go to work. Everybody takes a blanket and everybody got a loaf of bread with some
marmalade, margarine, and we started walking. Go into woods. We walked for about eight
hours. We come out from the woods to a little city. We see German soldiers retreating. They
came. “Why don't you even go? Don't you see the war is almost over? What do you want for
them?” They don't know. They have different orders. They took us back to the woods.

We walked another eight hours, 16 hours walking. | had swollen legs from the
walking. | could hardly walk but somebody helped me. And other people wouldn't walk, got a
bullet in the head. The woods were full with dead people. Who could walk that much? We
were hungry, skeletons. | had better than anybody else, but they were skeletons. Walked 12,
14 hours a day with a little slice of bread and black coffee and this was the food.

Anyway, | came to myself. So the second night it was winter, cold, snow,
everything. We went to sleep in the barn. We sleep in the barn. There was food for the
horses and cows. Everybody helped themselves that they finished off all the food what was.
The farmer complained. They ate up all the food | prepared for the horses and cows. For
punishment, we didn't sleep anymore in the barn but on the outside in the snow. We huddled
up.

After two weeks walking, we went by --
>> Bill Benson: Just so -- our audience knows this. This was what we now call a Death March
because so many people died on your march.
>> Morris Rosen: But what happened two weeks, we went by the Elbe River. Everybody had

to get under it, everybody, lice, no washing, dirty. We slept one on another because it was
cold. We got to get undressed and jump into the water, wash ourselves and wash your
clothing. Ok. Washed ourselves.

Have a nice bunch of friends. Eight people. Only intelligent people. We never
mentioned food in camp. If you mention food, you are hungry. Only what book did you read?
Did you have a girlfriend? What movie did you see? Highly intelligent friends | had. It helped
because when we came out of the water, we rubbed our back, jumped around. Then "Get
dressed." Put on my pajama. It was only a pajama. No underpants no undershirt. Wooden
shoes without socks. And | put on my pants. It was like a board. It falls. So | was warm on
the left side -- like walking shorts. The other one | pulled apart, little by little.

Let me tell you, about three, four days later, about 400 people died from the cold.
No eat. No nothing. Then finally we come up hill to the camp. Like you say, no good person,
he starts screaming, “Walk like soldiers.” Well, he was number two when they opened up the
camp for killing. He was a murderer. That's what they picked to be in the camps, murderers.

He started hitting left and right. One, two, three. And we should start singing. Who
had power to sing? We were tired. We couldn't walk. We were hungry. We came to the gate.
Who was at the gate? Only communists. Political prisoners. When he arrived, “Are you better
than them?” They put them down to the ground. He got a beating from all the Kapos there.
They left us. He got bloodied all over his eyes. He says, “Now we are going to kill them
inside.” Soon he comes out, but we didn't have the luck. We went in. He was still there.
Finally somebody saw him at the other end of Buchenwald. He got out from the dead person

the uniform. So we couldn't catch him, anything.

And the smell in Buchenwald was unbelievable. What you smell -- they give us the
first food, so a bunch of people, they came, call people. They grabbed your food. We didn't
eat for so many days. I'm all the time, you know, about the situation. What is it? The smell, |
want to see where the smell comes. | went to the left where eight mountains, about six, seven
feet high, with bodies. And some people were still alive. | come there to look at it. One guy
chased out from Germany, lived in our city. | played with him in the Maccabiah, ping-pong,
chess, everything. He was laying on the top. He was in our camp, but he was planting flowers
by the SS so he had a lot of food to eat. But on the Death March, he didn't have food so
they're the ones that died first. The ones that were used to hunger, they held out. So he was
on the top with one eye closed, almost. He says, "Don't worry" [Inaudible].

Then | saw for the first time cannibalism. Two guys with knives cut out from bodies
that are still alive. | said, “What are you doing?” So he came with the knife for me. | ran away.
As | ran away, there was an order. “All the Jews out!” Everything. | says, “What all the Jews
out?” The Americans brought in Air Force near Buchenwald. | said, “I'm not going out.” So |
Saw a guy jump into the -- the walls. Cement built the blocks. It was hollow. So | saw him
jump in. | jumped in. I'm not going nowhere. I'm not getting on the Death March.

Then we wait. After two hours, a lot of people noticed that they jumped in. One SS
noticed. He have started chopping up. | managed to get out, knocked out the window in our
block. | cut myself. | ran out to the transport that was ready to go out, otherwise | would be

American Army came the next morning.

We walked on foot. It was full of glass. People were barefoot that didn't have shoes
cut themselves. It wasn't a building where a painter should be in the window. Everything from
bombing. Everything destroyed. They load us in in open wagons, about 120. No food, no
nothing on the train.

Ok. We were so tight that we have to stay in cold as can be. Don't forget it was
March. Very, very cold. And what we have? Pajamas. No food. No water. Nine days. We
threw out bodies every night. Finally we slept on the bodies because it was so cold to lay
down. So we slept on the bodies.

On the ninth day we come. The train stopped. We begged them for water. They
put the locomotive buckets of water. So we begged them. They brought a bucket of water.
And everybody. Then they gave us some soup. They gave us soup. | look at it. | taste. | spit
out. | says, “Don't you take the soup. This is poison.” They wanted to poison everybody
before we arrived somewhere. | threw away the soup. Everybody did.

Then suddenly, every five minutes two Soviet planes. And they machine gunned on
the locomotives. They saw that this is prisoners. And there were so many, about eight
different trains, all with prisoners from all over Germany. And they start shooting up the
locomotives. And finally, two of them got wounded. And people started jumping out. | think
maybe we can escape. No, there was transport soldiers. So we rounded everybody up.
Back.

So suddenly | see a young boy from my city, a neighbor. He was only about 13

survive. | said, no, my luck is with this transport. I'm going to be -- you want, you can join me.
Come in here.

Of course, we didn't have more to go so we walked. We started walking. We came.
Everything was on fire. You probably read that over 100,000 were killed. Says, oh -- when we
were bathing here in the water, in the river, in the Elbe River, now everything is on fire.

Finally, on the seventh day we arrived to Theresienstadt. We arrived 11:00 at night.
They were full of transports from all over Germany. Cold as can be. They couldn't take us into
sleep, so we slept on cobblestones. But they gave each one hot soup with a lot of bread. And
this was good.

The next morning, they took us into barracks. They took off our clothing because it
was dirty, filthy. And they gave us -- | got a new pair of pants from somebody, from the ghetto.
Two shirts. | got -- | lost what -- | had a picture that my boss took in the camp where two SS
men to take us, the three painters. | show it up. My head was full, so | have to give up. | lost
the picture there. It would be probably the only picture taken where they took us with machine
guns to work.
>> Bill Benson: Was that the last photograph you had?
>> Morris Rosen: Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: You had lost every photograph.
>> Morris Rosen: All the photographs | lost in Buchenwald. Why? He said if you have
something, hide. And he gave away a lot of gold pieces. They had money. So | gave this.

Meanwhile, we didn't take a shower. They take everything away, | would lose. Meanwhile, |
came back, that man got shot. Never found anything.

| went back to Buchenwald after the war with the Red Cross. They sent me there. |
begged them maybe the pictures are here. No. | lost all the pictures. Maybe they can find
them.

They put us in barracks. 30 people we were there. I'm there with the 30 people. It
was terrible. People got sick. People got sick there. And finally the Russian Army came over.
| don't know what happened, but | jumped out the window from the second floor and | laid
unconscious. | don't know if one day, two days, three days. | will never Know. But the only
thing | Know that the Soviet officer with the Czech partner woke me up. They get up, you
liberated.

But | heard, like in sleep, like a song that the Russians sing. | keep this every time
thinking about it. And | found a record. | put it on to remind myself, the song. Yeah. You can
go back to the barrack. | come back to the barrack. There were only 12 people. There were
30. They all died from Typhus. It was Typhus epidemic. Came here. Must have been a
couple of the Belgium horses with a whole wagon, with wine, money. He must have gone into
a bank and millions of marks, hundred mark bills still in the packs. So people had diarrhea.
They put on a hook their money.

years later. Yeah.

So what happened after three days, they come, two nurses, take me to a doctor.
What did you eat? You were three days not here. Well, we had -- [Inaudible] he said, “If not
for the wine, you wouldn't be here. You wouldn't alive. The sardines too fat.” And people
have their graves, 40,000, 60,000. My friends from the camp. They all died from Typhus and
for the food. The Russians didn't have no sense.

The American soldiers, if they liberated again, they treated them like babies. They
didn't give them no food. Only like babies they feed them. The Russian came with the same
food the Army ate: bacon, meet meat, potatoes, sauerkraut. You don't eat two, three weeks,
the stomachs are shrunk, so you die. That's why you have so many dead. That's why Typhus.

Then somebody calls me. Who was there? My sister's husband heard on the radio
I'm alive. In Europe from 10:00 to 2:00 in the morning, they said on the radio from the Red
Cross where everybody from the camp. Think father-in-law heard on the radio | am alive. He
was in Budapest. He came and took me up on his son's paper. Otherwise -- it was Typhus
epidemic. They didn't let nobody out, to spread around. But | was -- | came with him as a
journalist. | went out with his paper.

So we walked. The train supposed to leave in the morning. So we go into a
restaurant, white table cloth. | started crying. This is the first time I'm human being again. A
white table cloth with napkins not paper napkins but linen and the soup and bread and go out
to sleep in white bedding with two pillows. | cried all night long. | couldn't take it because
suddenly | became not a wise man but a person again.

So in the morning the train comes by. The train is full. My brother-in-law pushed me
on the roof. He went on the roof. Hold on. He held me on the roof. Full with people there.
Unbelievable. We arrived in Prague. Did they treat us with food? | didn't eat much. Every
corner was the Jewish heart. All you want to eat. Roll and butter, this, milk. | ate so little. We
slept there in the hotel floor, all the refugees.

At night comes the transport. Some hefty girls, must have been farmers, back to
Poland, and jumped on our beds. They want to sleep with us. Are they took -- | had a nice
pajama that they took. Everything was torn up. My brother lost all from his pants all the
things.

In the bathroom | brushed my teeth. | had my cup and everything. So a little boy,
redhead, freckled, asked me in a nice Polish way, “Can | borrow the cup? | want to brush my
teeth.” | looked at him, | said, “Moniek,” because | knew a redhead, freckled. He jumped on
me. He knew who lam. We both cried. What a character. We went on the river there in
Prague. On the boat, he wanted to make some happy things, a kayak. And then he knew so
many languages. There were two Russians and two girls. “Can you give one girl to us? You
have two of them.” They started chasing us. We got out. He was something.

And then I'm supposed to go back to Poland. | am at the station. They gave mea
ticket to the train. At the train | see coming from -- | was supposed to go by train. | saw
survivors. You can't recognize them. You recognize a survivor. “Why do you want to go

you right back. Tell them you're from Germany. You go back to Germany.”
Ok. We go on the train. Yes. We come to a station where the brother comes out.

What happened --

>> Bill Benson: Morris, | got to stop us now. I'm going to turn back to Morris to conclude our

| went to the police. Right away | told them I'm a survivor. I'm Polish. Don't tell
them you're Polish. Tell them you're Jewish, a Jew from Poland. They hated the Pols
because when the Germans took part of Czechoslovakia, the Pols -- oh, they took. And a lot
of Czech soldiers got killed. Only one Pol was a Jew that got killed. His name, | remember
still his name. | said -- he got to be killed. That's what | had in mind all the time.

Anyway, | went there from city to city they gave me to sleep. | approached the
hospital there. Because the police tell me they, too, Jewish girls. | went there with -- they
wouldn't tell me. Wouldn't tell me who they are. | almost cried. So there was a nurse probably
going up. There were five girls sick from Typhus. As | walk out, one started, “Morris, don't you
recognize me?” In Polish, a neighbor of mine. She was there. “Where's my sister?” She was
in the same camp. Says she's in Volary. Says you go there, you'll find. Sick from Typhus, so

back to Morris in a moment to close our program. I'd like to thank all of you for being here very
much. Hope you can come back. We'll have our First Person program every Wednesday and

photographer, Joel, will walk up on the stage and he's going to take a photograph of Morris

Morris is done, I'll ask you to do that.

Morris, you're going to stay around afterwards for few minutes?
