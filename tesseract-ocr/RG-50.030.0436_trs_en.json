He was a very well-educated man who was very interested in education and since I was an only child, he gave me a lot of attention in this area. He had returned from the first World War with a shrapnel in his hip which was not properly removed, so he was not well, he didn't walk easily and was very sedentary and his greatest joy was to teach me. Geography, history, languages. This is how he instilled in me a great love for education."

            "answer": "Very mixed, our neighbors left and right were not Jews, but there were also quite a few Jews among them. It was, until 1937, I was not at all aware. I shouldn't say that because I do remember now that on Memorial Day, which is a holiday for everywhere in the world and schoolchildren went to the cemetery but the Jewish schoolchildren were separated from the others and went to the Jewish cemetery. That is when I became aware that, that there was a difference between the other children and me. That's all I remember."

            "answer": "Yes, yes, at that time I became aware of anti-Semitism and particularly in 1937, there were times where in our town, soldiers, Romanian soldiers and particularly Romanian officers, who probably often got drunk, were roaming the streets with guns, with the revolvers in their hands and yelling loud words against Jews. Yes, I was, that was when I began to be very much afraid."

So I didn't have a complete feeling of being betrayed by every Christian, you know. But, I can't describe it too well, this 1s how it began."

I can't, when I think of this now, I just can't understand how my parents did not accept my uncle's offer to leave. They, they simply didn't think that anything could happen to them. And we saw a number of Jews from Poland coming to our town and we made room where we lived for them to sleep and we saw how it happened, but we still didn't believe it. And then in 1940, when Hitler and Stalin made this pact, we had not very much of a choice. We thought, since we knew what happened under Hitler to people, that we would in fact be better off to stay where we are and very many people were glad that the Soviets came. Of course, we didn't know what would happen. It was hard."

            "question": "What else?",
            "answer": "The interesting part was that their propaganda was so efficient, they, there were concerts, the people danced in the streets. There were speeches that there is no better quality of life than in the Soviet Union. The children got their education for free. The older people got their medical help for free. People were taken care of from their birth to their day they died. They never had to worry. And all of this wonderful thing happened because the Communist government knew how to take care of it's people. And in the meantime, during the night, people disappeared. And this, this was very, very difficult, because it hit us almost immediately and then one of the Soviets, who moved into our house, told me, first of all he said to me, \"You know that there is no God.\" And you know this, for me, even though I was not brought up in a strict religious sense, it was awful thing for me to hear. And then when my father was taken away, this man, whose name I do not know, I don't think I even knew it then, this man said to me, \"Look, you are a young person, you have the best chance for a wonderful life in our country, but you have to put an ad in the paper that you want to have nothing to do with your father, who is an enemy of the people.\" And of course I didn't do it.

It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  4 This is how life was under the Soviets. We saw a big poster, said, was seen in many places. Stalin was holding on his lap a child and giving the child a wristwatch, because that child had informed the teacher that the parents at home had spoken against the government. And what the parents had said was, \"No eggs today for breakfast.\" And the father had said, \"Again no eggs?\" And this was regarded as counter-revolutionary talk. The parents were arrested and the child got a watch. The parents disappeared. That was how life was."

            "question": "Did, were Jewish businesses taken away, were people allowed to go to school, did sort of every day life change?",
            "answer": "People went to school and Jewish businesses were taken away, all businesses were taken away but the difference was that the Christians who had businesses could, under the pack that Hitler and Stalin had, could say that they are false Germans, which means that their ancestors were of German background and therefore they were not arrested. They had the right to be resettled into Germany and while the Soviets took away their houses in Sattagura(ph) or in one of those towns, when they were resettled, they got an, an equivalent house or apartment in Germany. And I even know about one man who was taken the same night as my father, who was a Christian and who was a merchant, a businessman. He, he dealt with, he sold ham and, and kielbasa and had pigs and made them, made, made these foods at home and then sold them. Well he was regarded a Capitalist. He was taken the same night, but he said that he was a false Deutschner(ph), he was not, he was actually a half Polish, half-Ukrainian Christian. Well he was taken out of the prison and sent to Germany. And he escaped, my father didn't."

They thought that it would be just the very rich people who, who should be treated that way, because they, they really This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Very well educated, very motivated towards education and very proud to, to read a great deal and to be considered intellectuals. Czernowitz was considered the little Vienna, whereas Bucharest, as the capital of Romania, was considered little Paris. In Bucharest, the second language was French, first was Romanian. In Czernowitz, the first language was German, because it had belonged to Austria, to the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, where most educated people spoke German."

They, in fact, didn't believe that anything could happen to them because they, in the first World War they served as Austrians, they got medals and awards and they were proud of that, they, they just couldn't believe that this could happen. They also couldn't believe that a civilized nation like Germany could do any harm to people. It was strange."

And also she had told me to put on two dresses, one on top of the other because I could not carry anything. I have to run and nobody should know that I'm running. So I put on a summer dress and over it a winter dress and made my way to Czernowitz."

            "num": 29,
            "question": "Why were you running there?",
            "answer": "Because the, this was the Soviets. Because the, a neighbor had said, who was friendly with a Soviet soldier, that he had told her that this night they are going to come for the whole family, after they had taken my father away. And so my mother had said, run and go to Czernowitz and stay with this family, trying to remember their name, Isinger(ph), Isinger(ph). Well, it wasn't easy. First of all the fear. When you are under curfew, there were everywhere soldiers and when they saw somebody moving they stopped him and wanted to know where are you going. Well, I knew the area very well, I managed somehow to make it to the next town. All night it took me. And when I came there, the Isingers(ph) told me they could not put me up because there was a raid in this apartment house and a number of people, whole families, were taken away. At that time they didn't know where to. We know now it was to Siberia. And so I had nowhere to go but to the Philharmonic, which also housed the Conservatory of Music, which also housed a movie theater, which was called Keynote Central. When I came there, I was dead tired, because I'd walked all night and I knew the building very well. I went up into this projection room, from the movie, knowing that nobody would be there at that time and I feel asleep o the floor. And I thought when I wake up in the morning, the only thing I could do, was to try to see if I could find a job in the conservatory, because I had just graduated, you know. So when I woke up it was not morning, it was closer to 12 noon. I had slept several hours and when I came to the office of the conservatory, this man was just closing the office. It was 12 and in Europe between 12 and one is lunch hour and I said, \"Could I come in for a moment, I'm looking for a job.\" And he looked at me and he said, \"A job? At 12 o'clock noon? This is time for lunch, not for a job.\" You know, he was very flip and I was not in the mood for, for this type of conversation, so I said, \"No, no, I want a job.\" He said, \"What, what job?\" I said, \"Well, I've, here's my paper, I have graduated from the conservatory and I am a pianist.\" He said, \"Well, now look, how much money do you have?\" And I said, \"Three This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  8 rubles,\" something like 75 cents. And he said, \"That's enough.\" And I said, \"What?\" I thought for lunch. \"No,\" he said, \"It's enough to get married.\" And I said, \"No, no, please don't joke with me, my mind is not on that.\" He said, \"Well I am not going to open this office door until I come back at one, but if you want to, you can come with me.\" And I trailed after him and I thought we were going to eat something and we went into some building. See, in the, at that time, every building was different from what we were used to. So we went up one or two flights of stairs. [End of Side 1 of Tape 1]. So we went up there and a young woman, around 17, asked, sitting behind a desk, asked, \"Do you want to get married?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And she asked him, \"Do you live with this woman?\" He said, \"No.\" \"Do you live with another woman?\" \"No.\" \"Do you have children?\" \"No.\" \"You have children with this woman?\" \"No.\" \"Do you have children with another woman?\" \"No.\" Then she asked me the same questions and to me all of this was an insult, because I never even had a date. And when this procedure was finished, she called over a man who was sweeping the floor, whose name I don't know to this day and he was the witness who signed and we got a piece of paper and we went downstairs and as we went downstairs, naturally we spoke German. He asked me, in the very formal German, \u2014\u2014_\u2014sO\"\"\u2014By the way, what is your name?\" And this after we got married. And so we went back to the conservatory, he enrolled me as a pianist accompanist and gave me right away work to do in a certain room with a choir, and told me at five o'clock we meet in front of the building and we go home. And no more running around. He never asked about my background, he never asked me what happened and he told me he had a mother and a sister at home, which I didn't believe, but I had no choice, I had nowhere to go. And at five o'clock I went with him and when we came home to his apartment, there was a mother and there was a sister. And now it was up to, it was their turn to be shocked because here was their famous son and brother, who had left in the morning a bachelor and had come back and told them, they asked, \"Who 1s this?\" And he answered, \"This is another Flor in the family.\""

Or maybe their sons, or brothers. And I think there were mostly men that they had taken at that time.

And, and even when my mother survived 17 years of Siberia and even after I found her again and she came to us here in the United States, when I tried to discuss with her what happened there, she never wanted to talk about it. And she said to me, whenever I asked to tell me about it, she said, \"No. No, no.\" And then I said, but, one day I got very angry and I said, \"They took your husband away and they killed him and you don't even know where he's buried and you don't want to talk about it?\" And she answered very quietly, \"He was an enemy of the people.\" And this was the man she loved and believed in. So they had done a very good job on her. I finally got her to tell me that she would, she had promised that main chief there never to talk about this event. He had said to her, \"If you ever want to see your children again, you will forget all that you lived here, all that you saw here.\" And she never wanted to talk about and to this day I do not know. Except here and there a little bit. She told me about this guard who had a child. I think it was probably only one child, one little boy and when he knew that she knew languages, particularly French, he wanted her to speak French to him and he gave her a glass of milk a day. And she, her living quarters were slightly improved, she shared a room with a lady from Czernowitz whose husband was also taken away, but he was taken because he was a leading Zionist and his name was Weiselberger(ph), very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But when the Germans really had to retreat, they began to shoot people and so all of a sudden they came in, came in, came in and we were 78 and you know, we were, right above us was our room and we, on the floors there was just straw, you know and then suddenly, we, we heard heavy boots like German boots, you know, you can't mistake that, above us and we were as quiet as possible and we heard them speak German. We knew at that moment that they must have found us, but it wasn't. They happened to have entered this room and they put a cannon in front of this room and they used that room to sleep over and we were underneath. At first we were quite sure that they knew we are downstairs and they are going to just kill us all. But then, the next morning and you, we were So quiet, you could just not imagine how quiet you have to be and the next morning they left. And after they left we were still there, quiet and then we decided we couldn't stand it any more, we could begin to feel smoke coming through and we decided we couldn't do anything but at that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And when we came out we were just pale and green and, and there were a few Russian partisans, maybe boys of age 13 or 14 who came and they looked at us and they said, in Russian, \u2014\u2014_, \"And who are you?\" They didn't know who we were. And we asked them, \"And who are you?\" And they said, \"Me Russki(ph) partisani(ph).\" Then all we could think of was to get home. But that, that was impossible. That was not possible, we had no way how to get home. Then, one or one trucker came by and had heard that there are some Jews who, maybe Jews have something to give to them, maybe they'll give them a ride. And he said, \"If you give me some vodka, I take youto _\u2014_\u2014_\u2014-.\u00a3\". So we, so a group of us got together and whatever we still had, a top or a blouse, or something, we exchanged with some peasants for vodka and we gave it to them and they took us. And they took us maybe two or three kilometers in a forest and dumped us in there and said, \"The Germans didn't do a very good job with you, they should have killed you all.\" And then we had to start walking, that was our liberation."

In the Czech army we were constantly facing the enemy, maybe one or two miles away, no more. The Germans were in front of us, the Soviets were behind us or next to us. We were allied soldiers of the Soviets. But, the sense of camaraderie between the people in the Czech army was absolutely magnificent, these were Jews, but not all of them were Jews, there were quite a few non-Jews. These were people who had run away from Hitler into Poland, when Hitler occupied Czechoslovakia. In Poland, they didn't know that the Soviets would occupy that part of Poland and when the Soviets came, the Soviets regarded these people as unreliables and put them into Siberia. Cause they said they weren't sure who they are. And in Siberia, at a certain moment in time, there was, everyone who was Czech was asked to join the Czech army. The Czech army consisted of all kinds of people, Jews and non-Jews, but mostly Jews. Women, children, old people, sick people, anybody who could walk, joined the army. It began in Boosoulouk(ph), in the, in the very interior of Soviet Russia, where, where the majority were concentrated and there were about,000 people who made up this army.

And the Ducla(ph) pass, we were held up endlessly long, it was difficult to get through and it was held by very few Germans but they were on the top and they saw us and we were on, in the valley. And anyway, many, many weeks it took before we could take the Ducla(ph) pass and then, then we were, we ended the war, the war was at an end when we liberated Prague. What was it like? It was for us very wonderful and for the people of Prague I don't know. They must have had mixed feelings because they also didn't know what is in store for them. One thing that I remember that turned me off and made me want to leave Europe for good was when we, we had survived concentration camp and was now in the Czech uniform and when we came to the first city in Slovakia, Koshitza(ph), we got orders to arrest anybody in the street who speaks German. And I said, \"Sam, this is not for me. We were in a situation where we were persecuted for no reason at all, I do not want to be part of a group of people who persecute somebody for speaking any language. I don't want to live there.\" And that is when I decided, no more Europe. That was the time. And by the way, when President Benish(ph), who was the President of Czechoslovakia, returned for the very first time from London to Koshitza(ph), to the first town in Czechoslovakia, it was Sam who conducted the orchestra for his welcome and he still has the program to show."

It was a blizzard and we were without, we were in uniform and without a coat, Czech uniform, we didn't have anything else and Sam and I went out, to one block away, to Broadway and we saw this drugstore with a display of soap in the window and we hadn't seen soap for three years and I said to Sam, \"They are also swindlers, they put, they put something into the window to pretend it's soap, but I'm sure it's not soap.\" And I could speak English, he couldn't. So I went inside and I wanted to see what the man will say to me if I wanted to buy a piece of soap and I came in, nobody was in except the man and I and I say, \"I want to buy a piece of Sweetheart soap,\" cause that was what was in the window. He said, \"One piece, wouldn't you want to have two for 29?\" And I thought to myself he's stalling, he's stalling. What is he going to say? I said, \"Yes, I could have two.\" So he disappears behind the counter and wraps something up and says, \"29 cents plus tax.\" I don't know what, 32 cents and he gives me a package and I pay and I come out and I didn't believe that he really gave me something so right out in this blizzard I open it and I smell it and I nearly fainted, it was soap. And I said, \"Sam, you know, he didn't see you, he doesn't know that you belong to me. You could go in and just say soap and you can say two soap and we could have four pieces of soap.\" He went in, he comes out with two pieces of soap.

And now I said, \"You know, they don't know here that we bought it there.\" So I go in and I buy again two pieces of soap and then he goes in. To make a long story short, we spent all that money on soap and we came to my uncle in South America with a, we had to buy a suitcase to put in the soap and we brought this soap to my uncle in South America. And he, who thought it was wonderful that we came, and we told him nobody should know, look what we have and he looked at that and he knew that we were nuts. He knew that something was very wrong with us. He told this to me many months later. So, this was the impression my uncle had of us."
