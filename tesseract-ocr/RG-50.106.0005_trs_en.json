What I saw was on my left, was a mass of dead bodies piled about eight feet high, and stretching out maybe 30 or 40 yards. The bodies had been soaked kerosene, ready to be burnt, but I guess we arrived too soon for them to do it. On my right, there were several people that were lying there, and some of them were crawling. Some weighed 80 pounds. Some looked half dead to me.

I can't remember for sure, but \"Vus Kenneth Tuin Zick Sehelthen, (ph)\" and one of them came up and tried to kiss my feet. The feeling of helplessness and not believing was very prevalent. The gentile soldiers who were with me were almost in tears and shaking their heads. And I remember one of the survivors coming up and telling me that the Polish SS had run out the back of the camp, and they were getting away. And then later, one of the our soldiers, who had gone back there, said that two of them had been caught by some of the inmates and killed. The scene that I described to you has never left my memory. And when I hear some of these groups that are now prevalent in the United States, around the world, that say that this never happened, this really prevailed on me to tell what I saw, because I will never forget it. We left this area soon after. I guess we had another assignment. And it was a long time ago, 50 years or so. I don't remember what that assignment was between you and me. But that scene that I saw at the entrance will never be forgotten, and I felt that I had to describe it."

And so that was really probably the exact date that Buchenwald was liberated. Because the fact that the SS troops that were still there, and they had tried to, you know, get rid of that evidence, so it was not more than one or two days difference."

He happened to be a jeweler who came to our house to show a small, little charm bracelet that we were trying thinking of getting for our twoyear old daughter at the time. Now, this was over years ago. But when he had heard that I went into the camp and was a liberator, he said you know, I was a survivor of Buchenwald, too.
