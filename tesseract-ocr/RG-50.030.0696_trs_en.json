I'll tell you something, when God_ -- I don't know, but always I did believe in God. Especially when they say it was one God, one God. So I do believe this God, He did create the world and He did create our world. He did create us. Now you will ask me, \"How did he create us?\" I'll tell you how. Did you ever hear of Abraham and Sarah?Sarah, when she was young, she couldn't have any children. She was crying and begging. But when she was 90-years old, when she could not have children, then God gave herthat she had one son, Yitzchok. So Yitzchok was the creation. Because by 90 years she couldn't have it. He was a creation. Now, what happened to Yitzchok? After being 37 years old God told Abraham to take Yitzchok and give to God as a qurban. You know what means a qurban?"

He lift up this knife and said to God, \"Now you have him.\" God stopped him and said, \"No, I don't want him to be killed.\" He didn't say, \"Don't touch your son,\" but \"Don't touch this boy.\" Why? Because as a son you gave him to me, so he's my son and to you he's just a boy.Do you understand? So what did God do? He gave him -- he gave him a animal, a kosher animal. There -- this animal couldn't walk any farther because _ stopped it. And he took Avram and killed the animal. He gave it to God instead Yitzchok, and Yitzchok was already God's son. This way we are children of Yitzchok, and this is our God. That'swhy I believe in God. You understand what I'm talking about? Now, we had Arvam, Yitzchok and Jacob. They are our forefathers. And we have foremothers, and they did have their children and this way God did create our nation. Now, if you'll ask me why did God need us? You know how? Because did you ever hear of Noah?
