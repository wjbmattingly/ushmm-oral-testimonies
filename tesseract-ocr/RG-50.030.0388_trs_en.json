And I was here a student till the war started. The war started, I still remember, Friday, 1939, and we heard immediately the thundering of the cannons. And all Jews left the city next day, Saturday.

            "answer": "Most of the contacts were Jewish. As a matter of fact, I did not practically know any Polish people, except neighbors who were close by. But to plays, I used to play with the Jewish children, and one started life a -- in -- as a child in goldstu, in elderidge, and Haider, and then -- and school started in the morning, school, and after that you go to a Jewish school all day long, all the years. And when there was no Haider, because I was relatively good student, and I passed fast everything, then I wa -- I was invited by people to -- to read Talmud, to learn more with them in -- without charge. They wanted me because I was a good student, so they wanted with their son -- that I learn with -- with their son. So, till the evening -- the evening th -- I came home, made the lessons, went to sleep. Next day the same thing."

And -- especially on certain holidays when I had to go around the long way home because there was a procession, and in -- in the short way, and I knew that I will be beaten up if I\u2019ll go there.

Cause -- because later we knew what was going on till \u00b039, because there were Jew -- papers, so we -- so we knew that Hitler is anti-Semite- Semitic, and there are certain concentration camps, but at that time, nobody spoke about mass destruction somewhere, or -- or -- or killings."

When I came to our city, was about a few days, the commander of the city, a ger - the German, told all Jews to come out one day. It was about the 15\" abou -- of -- of -- of September, and put all the Jews in trucks and took them out towards the Russian border. Left us in a place where the Polish army used to exercise. The next morning they came again, and told us to walk toward the Russians. And we walked over there, and they took away everything what we ha -- what we still had, if they saw anything valuable. Like, my father forgot to hide his golden watch what he had from his father, they took it away. And I still remember to -- today the first Russian soldier we saw. And while the German were talking to us in such a derogative way, he was so nice, and said something, and I didn\u2019t understand a word what he said. My father understood Russian because as a child, Shasnich was under the Russian, and he learned Russian. So he said, \u201cOh, he told us to go over there, where there is soup for us.\u201d Alright, we went there -- the Jewish population of this small place me -- pr-prepare soup -- soup for us. For we a-ate something warm, and after that they took us to Bialystok."

            "question": "Couple questions. First, I\u2019m sort of curious why the Germans pushed you toward Russian territory rather than just taking care of you themselves, and the other thing I want you talk a little bit about is kind of the general kind of mood, what it -- what this all felt like.",
            "answer": "As a whole, we were scared all the time, because we did not -- we knew that they hate Jews, as a fer -- a matter of fact, they -- this 1s why they took all the Jews and send them out, because they said that our city will be incorporated in the -- in the Reich, and they did not want to have Jews, the addition of Jews in the -- in the Reich, so they sa -- told us to go. And from the Russian point of view it was very nice [indecipherable] let us come in, as a matter of fact, for approximately two months, it -- borders were opening, everybody who came, who could -- who took advantage, and cou -- and came, survived. More Polish Jews survived after that in Russia than in Poland. The mood was of unknown. We don\u2019t know what expects us. We know that after that -- after [indecipherable] already in Bialystok that we are free to do various things, that nobody persecute us as Jew. If there is something, a lack of certain things, because we saw how eagerly the j -- Russian soldiers is buying various things on the market. [indecipherable] So it is because everybody -- or nobody has enough, but not because we were Jews. So from this point of view I felt a -- it was good and we thanked th-the -- th-the German officer did not like to have Jews in hi -- in [indecipherable] in the -- in th-the matter of fact, in comparison 1s all the cities around Shasnich, more Jews survived Shasnich than all the -- in the cities around it, because they were completely destroyed."

            "question": "Were you with your f -- were you with your family? Who was with you at this point?",
            "answer": "At this -- at that place, we were -- had part of the family, two -- I -- one -- my youngest brother and sister stayed with -- with aunts in another city, because it was near where they stayed when my -- when my -- our family left Shasnich the next day after the war, they stayed there because we did not know what will happen to us. I went with my older  4 brother, further, and we came back, so we were -- and my -- my older sister, Anya, she was -- She worked in Warsaw. And when Warsaw was taken, she came back to Shasnich, and she was told that all the Jews were send away, so she didn\u2019t know where to go, she went to the -- my aunt in -- 1 -- where my brother -- younger brother and sister were. And they -- she organized here a group of people she knew, and they all went also to the rush  toward the Russian border. She asked my aunt and cousins to go with them, and they said no, they are business people, what do they do in Russia? They didn\u2019t know -- they were afraid of Russia. And nobody survived, them. And my sister came -- as a matter of fact, I wanted to go back to bring my sister, and my father told me, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have - I\u2019m missing two daughters and -- and -- and a -- and a son, I don\u2019t want to be -- to miss another son.\u201d He didn\u2019t let me. So every day I was going in Bialystok to the train station, waiting, watching, maybe my sister will come. And sure enough one day I saw a group and she was here, this is my younger sister, and she -- she came. We lived in Bialystok in a -- in one room, four or five families. Everybody had a corner, and sleeping on the -- on the floor, so many people were in the city, because the city of say like 100,000 had a - had about 150,000 foreigners [indecipherable] who came in. There was no old schools, or- synagogues were taken up by people as -- we slept on the floors. And one day there were -- came also a couple of guys, and it was my brother-in-law, and they started to like each other, my sister and my -- and my future brother-in-law, who came from Warsaw, also, to -- told -- went over to Russia. And we signed up -- there were always so-called - we called them byersgame, and they were looking for people to work somewhere deep in Russia, and they were taking the people there to work. We said, we have nothing to lose, we don\u2019t have what -- we will sign up -- we didn\u2019t know where to -- and we signed up to go to work in Russia. They took us to a construction place. We drove for about a week on the railroad, deep into the Ural mountains. We came there, it was middle -- 1t was October, and I remember it was such a storm that from the railroad to the building to go down, was about 500 yard. We were running, and most of the people ended up this short pla -- walk, or run, to have frozen nose, frozen ears, because it was minus 40 something."

Jewish -- the Je -- Jewish population organized help for the various people who came from all over Poland. And I don\u2019t know if I - exactly how the organization worked, but from our point of view they we -- we were relying on getting somewhere, something to eat, in order to survive. So we were looking for a place to -- to go to live permanently. Here and there, you heard, people did go into Russia, and they came back, because they say oh, it is such a poor life the -- there 1s -- the people don\u2019t had no -- you don\u2019t have stores open where you can buy things, and so on. And as a matter of fact, there were some people who decided maybe they\u2019 Il go back to  5 the German -- to where the German 1s -- to the Jew -- home [inaudible]. And after that, Stalin use all these lists of people who s -- wanted to go back, and send them all to Siberia. And thanks to that, they survived, because the local population up there were - was killed in \u201940 -- \u00b041 - 42."

But on the whole, what I saw later, that Russia suffered from a lack of food, in spite of the fact they ha -- they had Ukrainia, which ha -- ga -- which has the -- had the best land in -- in Europe. So -- but this was -- I have ler -- later learned, was the illness of Russia, the -- the collectives. Cohoss what they called, they did not produce enough food.

We were all supposed to work on the construction. This was a small place where they build -- they were supposed to be build houses for miners, because they had a copper mine, and also the copper had a certain percentage of gold, so gold and copper was being taken out. And Jewish people came, and we were taught to build, and we worked 1n this region. Since I was below 18, so I did not have to work eight hours a day, but just six hours a day. And one day a week we had free, so the -- in the winter they volunteered me always to shovel snow, because there was plenty of snow. In the winter the temperature was unbelievably cold. I cr -- I did not e-expect -- I didn\u2019t hear about such cold, and we were work -- working on construction till minus 40 degrees. When there was minus 41, we could stay home. And we were supposed to work for one year. And this is what happened for one year. We worked there, and after that, they said you are free to go."

            "num": 16,
            "question": "I want to know a little bit more about the life there. Was -- was your family with you? Who -- who went with you? Did you -- were you able to sort of keep up some of your traditions? What was the life like?",
            "answer": "No, n -- ta -- Jewish traditions we have not kept at all. We did not know when a holiday is. Approximately we knew a -- there will be Passover, but nobody knew about - definitely we can dream about matzos, was only food and bread, and bread was also so and so much per family. There was a card system. Per person, you got such and such an amount of bread. All other things were not available. You couldn\u2019t go in a store if you want meat, you could buy only on the market, not in stores. Sugar you ca -- y -- they got  they gave us -- we call it gave us, in other word we were buying, twice -- a few times a year, before a holiday. Like before the revolu -- anniversary of the revul -- revolution, and before the first of May, this is where we got -- we could buy the pound of sugar, or  6 two pounds of sugar per person. In other cities, in large cities in Russia was different, and I had a chance, because my mother was sick, and she stayed in Bialystok in the hospital, and after that, I went to pick her up, and I st -- went to -- I got from the encoverdare from the -- I would just call the near -- the DPU? Anyway, permission to go, to get the ti - tickets. So I saw how I came -- stopped in Moscow, we slept there on the tr -- on the -- on the -- in -- at the station, and from there ti -- changed to another train to Bialystok. And in Moscow I could go out in the street, and -- and -- an-and buy sugar, so I -- I bought, I remember 10 on -- or 12 kilo, which is 20 pound of sugar, and carry it with me. Cause each time I went, I went in, there was a line where they gave only two pounds, but -- so I went five times, until they saw, \u201cHey, you were here already. Ill call a policeman.\u201d So I left. So I went -- went back. So I saw in other places in large cities that you can get. But when I -- then I brought my mother to Rakichenka, and they stayed there till we were free to -- to go where we want. My sister and my brother-in-law they had -- in the meantime had a little girl, and they decided to leave. My brother-in-law was getting letters from friends. And they said in the Polish part of Russia, like Bialystok, they were there, in charge, because they were Communists. And they said, \u201cCome back, and you\u2019|l have - you'll be alright. Come in.\u201d So they went. They came to the border, the former bor -- the former border between Poland, and they -- and they did not let them go through. So they came -- they came -- it was near Minsk, they went into Minsk. And here in Minsk, I -- we knew somebody, and the story was, when we were in Rakichenka, I learned fast to -- the language, to read and write Russian. And one day a young man came to me, \u201cSam, write me a letter in Russian.\u201d And he told me in Polish what to write, \u201cDear uncle, I am the son of your brother,\u201d so and so. \u201cWe received from your letters till 1936. In 1936, we stopped getting any letter. If you are alive, please write to me, I am here in Rakichenka, and I am here working till -- I am supposed to work till the end of 19 -- till 1940. And please write.\u201d After a short time he got a answer, and it came back to me, say -- the letter was written by his cousin. \u201cYour uncle passed away, but I live in his house,\u201d and it said, \u201cWhen you will free -- be free, come to Minsk, my husband is a officer in the Red army, he\u2019ll arrange for you to be able to stay in Minsk.\u201d And indeed, when our contract finished, he left for Minsk, and he kept -- he wrote us letters on a -- wrote them because we were -- thanks to me he got -- went there. \u201cOh,\u201d they say, \u201cyou can go in stores, they are -- you can get jobs here, and your -- and there is a different life.\u201d\u201d Temperature definitely no comparison. There is no such a temperature like it was in -- in Poland, close to. No in -- because in Rakichenka, we were about 10 days a year without wind. Winter was a cold wind blowing, in summer a hot wind blowing. Summer you -- you slept in the outside, because it was too hot to sleep in the house, and winter was too cold. So my sister and brother-in-law went to Minsk and -- and this officer arranged for them a place to stay, and a job. Because in a large city in Russia at that time, you could get a job if you had an apartment, if you had a place to live. And you could get a place to live if you had a job. So it was a circle, so that people from outside will not be able to get into the large city, because in the large -- large cities like Minsk, Kiev, and so on, there were -- it was another type of living than in the -- than in the small places where we were in -- deep in Russia. So they got their place to live, and they wrote a -- now it was my turn to come, because I wanted to start -- to continue to study. And in the large Russian cities, you  7 could work at day and study in the evening. You couldn\u2019t where we were in a small place, in -- in Rakichenka. We didn\u2019t have money for the whole family to leave, and when we -- we sold what -- what excess of -- we had, in order to -- so that I could buy a ticket for me, and I went. And I managed to come to Minsk, there were three weeks before the war started. Before June. So in June I went -- I came to -- to -- beginning of June to -- I came to Minsk. The 22\u2122 of June, the -- the -- the Germans attacked, and Minsk was bombed. We tried to go back toward -- after few days we tried to go back toward Moscow, but the Germans were in front of us. They came from the north. They took Smollensk before they took Minsk. So we -- we ha -- had to go back. And after a month, they told the Jews to come to form the ghetto. So I -- yeah, I believe in July or in August, they formed the ghetto, and we were in ghetto in Minsk. In ghetto, life was -- we try -- we found a -- a -- a place, an unfinished house, one room. So we in the one room, my brother-in-law, sister, the child, and me -- and myself, so we are in one room. Again it started. The Germans were giving us -- giving us two pound of bread per person and that was that. So the people, in order to survive were selling various things, whatever they had. In Russia, people were assembling, everybody -- whatever was in the store, they were buying. I remember there was a saying when you went somewhere you saw suddenly a line, so th-the question was, what do they give? Once I asked, \u201c\u201cWhy do they say, what do they give? Why don\u2019t they say what do they sell?\u201d So one was standing in line said, \u201cIf you buy it here, it is like you got it,\u201d because after that you can sell it for two or three times the price. So everybody was assem -- whatever they could buy, and everybody had so and so many yards of material. And so, as a whole, ke -- to keep it whole, a supply, not to wait when you need a pair of pants to buy a pair of pants. And this was a time when everybody was selling what they had. Peasants were coming from around the area, and the border of the ghetto was always a -- an exchange. We were living on this -- we were -- in the middle people were coming a -- we have a woman was coming, she has a suit she wants to change for potatoes. We -- my brother-in-law was [indecipherable] he used to go over to the Russian side. We always had -- had -- we could snap the -- the wire, there were wires around, and -- and g -- and go over, and -- and since he, as a whole looked like what they call a -- looked like a po -- a Pole, and so he was going out and there getting more than on the -- on the border. You know, he used to come and take it in, and I was standing, watching, and there 1s a policeman nearby. And giving him signs he has to come, or not to -- not to come. And this way we were -- we were getting there a little more than what you could get a-at a border, so we were in the middle mi -- in this way -- from this way we lived, we -- we got a certain amount of food from it."

            "question": "Was there a risk?",
            "answer": "Oh yes, there was a risk, because there were a lot of people killed, I mean, but my brother-in-law even -- when -- later when the slats went even into -- into -- to villages. He went out of the city 10 - 20 miles, and there exchange it, and bring it back, were two guy. I went a few times, but since I wear glasses, they immediately recognized me as a Jew, and -- because Russians usually don\u2019t wear glasses. So I used to walk without glasses, and without glasses I don\u2019t see anything. So I couldn\u2019t go too much -- too often. Once or  8 twice I went -- once or twi -- a number of times I went out. There was one family was working the place where they were making vodka. [indecipherable] but he used to bring us so and so many bottles vodka, and we had a steady guy who was giving us food, either flour, or various kind of -- various kind of other -- other food for the -- for the vodka. We were a Steady supplier, and we were giving them, and a little bit leaving over for us. And once I remember I went over and a policeman caught me, with a ra -- another guy and I - and I was thinking a -- I was looking for a stone to hit him, because I -- you know, I will not go into the -- into the police station, because if somebody was taken to the police, he never came back. But he went with me, he saw where I came from, and he saw there the bottle vodka was still on the table, what I left, and there -- and they took me out into the  took me back to the border and said, don\u2019t -- to the -- go -- go back to ghetto, don\u2019t ever come back, and that was strange. And after that, the guy with who [indecipherable] I saw him in -- in the ghetto. And I thought that it was two policemen. I said, \u201c\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He said, \u201cI am a -- I am a Jewish guy, and I was outside, and this policeman caught me. And then we saw you, walking with a bottle of vodka. So we went to this place, and I paid for the vodka so that he can take the vodka, and he let me go. And he let you go, too.\u201d So this was anything, this is how we were trying to get out. It was no problem to go out, because we always -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re walking around with something to cut the wires, 1n order to be able to pass. But the question, well what you do after that? Everybody was -- most of the people were scared. There was one family to -- I used to go there to ask them for a piece of bread to bring to my sister, or -- and after that he begged me not to come, because he didn\u2019t open the door, because he said the neighbors know, they noticed it. Because they were afraid. They did not want to be killed just because I came there. So we were going -- we were taken to work. At work we were getting -- men were ge -- getting some food at work. And there I was always either begging, if it was a a-- if I -- if I cleaned the rooms of soldiers, begging them if they have a piece of bread. A good -- a good German was giving me a piece of bread, or something else to eat, and if he was bad, he gave me a kick. So if it was outside the cities, I was -- there were always something growing, so we\u2019re stealing a few -- a few carrots, or a few potatoes. And if the- in the worse case, when they didn -- when I didn\u2019t have what to take, so I was taking even the clippings from potatoes from the -- from where we worked, for it was -- my sister used to wash the clipping, and make -- make from this potato latkes. And this is on what they lived. Since the war -- the war -- the wa -- there was one guy who we always were ascared of, and his name was Gorajetski. He was a -- he had written on the -- belina politsi was written. He spoke Russian and German, obviously. And he could not eat breakfast without killing a Jew. And once we -- he got us, and we worked for him, my brother-in-law and myself, and we said never again. And this was not work, it was just making fun of us. Trying to catch -- to carry -- and running and beating us while we were carrying it from place to place, and then another group was taking it further, and so on. This was fun for him. So -- and after that, he organized like a -- a camp separate. The people could not come from [indecipherable] outside the ghetto. They were there with a group of Ukrainians were guarding it, and these people could not come home to the ghetto, they were sleeping over there. So whenever we saw him we did not go to work, because normally people -- other workers were coming, looking for people to work,  9 taking to work, doing either construction work, or cleaning, or whatever, and in the evening coming back at home, you know. This we wanted. In order to avoid, since they were looking for work -- were looking for workers each time, and looking for people to this camp -- it was on Schirrocca Street, I remember, we -- in order to be able to hide, we built a double wall. A very -- we moved the wall in our apartment, made it a little narrower. Since we worked in construction, I went to the neighbors room and covered it, a -- because otherwise we could -- you could see through. And in our place was just wood. So we could open, go in, hide, and -- and talk to neighbors, they realized, hey, whenever they\u2019re looking for -- for men, you are running home. Where do you hide in the- in there? And then they saw the -- the Ukrainians are going in and coming out empty, no wa -- nobody -- they don\u2019t catch you. They looked -- they told us, they look for where we\u2019re hiding, and they didn\u2019t no -- they didn\u2019t no -- notice that we had build this -- this double wall to hide. Other people were hiding behind -- under the floor -- the fir -- floor, there was a place to crawl in, and they were hiding there. So this was as long as they were looking just for men, and once we saw e -- they were taking whole families. Since we lived all in a place where the street was a free, for Aryan, not for Jews, on the other side was ghetto, on this side was a ghetto. And so we saw they were -- they take -- they took whole families, a few thousand people. And taking them out and then they never came back. And they shortened the ghetto, they made the ghetto smaller. So we start to think, what do we do for -- if -- if they come here? In addition to wait, we started to hear that they have automobiles where they put in people, and put the gas in -- in automobile, and they gas the people in there. So whenever we heard -- heard cars coming, we started to hide. What to do with the -- your little girl, the little girl that we too -- took her in between the wall, was crying there. So we cided -- decided to build something on the first of this -- we lived on the second floor. On the first floor, there was one part which was not finished. In one of the not finished room, they build a deep, in the ground, we put wa- tube, so to -- so they\u2019ll get air, and there we saw, when the little girl was crying, outside you didn\u2019t hear. So the next time there was a thing where we had to hide, I was taking my brother-in-law, sister, and the child to this, lay down, and I was covering it with sand. Sand made it even so that you don\u2019t see that anything is there. Then I was going up and hiding in the -- between the door. And this way how we were all kind of - we Call it pogroms, we survived the pogroms in this way."

Once I remembered exactly the date. I think it was in July, but I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t recall now. And at that time, they took all the women and children out, and killed them. And I remember after four days we were going back, and everybody was crying, being sure that his relatives, his wifes, children, or mothers are -- are gone. And we thought so too, my brother-in-law and myself, I went. And then we came and my sister and the child were alive. And she said on the third day after she saw that we did not come, she wanted already to go out. What she did is, she was going in -- into -- sitting in th -- in the hiding place without cover. And she was -- and why didn\u2019t I -- the Germans not come, I can\u2019t understand. And after this [indecipherable] because we wanted the Germans not to come, so we started to use the approach to it as a toilet, because we wanted not people to come.  11 Once I -- I -- I heard Germans were saying -- came in and I did not run up to, yet, to my door. When they were downstairs, \u201cOch, this smells like urine, the -- the -- the dirty Jews.\u201d So they use [indecipherable] especially use it -- use it [indecipherable] all. So I assume that this is when -- so the approach to the -- to the hiding place was dirty and had to -- you had to go in -- in through -- in the -- and they did not want to do it. So this is how she survived. And she thought that we were probably all taken out to be killed. So she wanted already to go out, and then she says she waited, and then we came. When we walked out in the street, my little niece was the last Jewish child in -- in -- in Minsk -- in the ghetto Minsk. Cause you didn\u2019t see, and everybody looked. \u201cHey, a child.\u201d\u2019 Because, yes, women survived, either they were working, or they were hiding somewhere. But children were not -- she was the last one alive. And this was a time when already we started to get contact with people who knew something about partisans."

And I got sick after 1 -- after 1 -- after him, too. And they took me to the hospital, and I had such a high fever, that I remember after that that I was saying, \u201cHey, the war is over.

But in -- in another two or three weeks, I came back to my -- to my normal -- I became back to my normal me, and I started to go to work again. The type of work where to serve a -- the military -- the Germans, you know. Either they were adding something, cleanin - cleaning where they lived, cleaning the rooms was -- and this is something what I -- what people were looking for, because we could always get something from them to eat, to go out.

And even Russian Jews were not too fluent Yiddish, started to speak yid -- Yiddish. And you could see immediately the effect of -- [indecipherable] of Polish Jews who were -- who were in the ghetto, because they liquidated small places, and those who survived came to -- to Minsk, also other Russian je -- places, the ghettos were immediately liquidated, or slowly, and -- and they came to -- to Minsk. So Minsk had about -- the ghetto had about 120,000 Jews, and they were not just Jews from Minsk, but also from -- but mostly from the surrounding area. So culturally I could not see anything Jewish going on. Was -- everything was temporary -- temporarily. Russian Jews was hoping a -- the Red Army will come back, and viddle will maybe save them.

And he -- well, I was astonished to hear that he personally knew Stalin, that he was a member of the Communist party for so and so many years, from o -- the Polish and n -- that they were -- that the Gestapo is looking for him, so we s -- we said, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll hide him.\u201d And sure enough we put him in the place  15 there where my -- where we were hiding my sister and the -- their little girl.

So we asked him if he could d-do us a favor, put the child into an orphanage. We told him where there is an orphanage, and put her there that he found her. [indecipherable] a name Faynia Nikolayov Nasoharoa, I still remember, that this 1s her name, and I was teaching her her name. And so that whenever we were asking neighbors to ask her what her name, so she always used to say Faynia.  16 Faynia Nikolayov Nasoharoa. But when I asked her, she used to say, \u201cBut really, I am Fanyat Zokor.\u201d She -- two years old. And that -- he put her there, and he used to come after work.

He used to go -- go with her so that she -- a b -- a block away from the ghetto she used to watch -- observe the girl. She was sitting always alone, not playing with the other children. One day the -- somebody came and said they are ready to -- that we should leave. And we said goodbye at that time. A day before that said goodbye to -- to Heinz. And next day, you -- you said according to -- we worked out -- we-went up like we were going to work, and after that, everybody took off the -- the -- the yellow signs, and we were -- went -- we had a woman who was leading us out of the city.

But there were Jews in the place where I was, one Jew was a very famous guy. Not -- also the second one. We used -- we used to go out here, I saw something being done. Each time the group of 10 people, eight - 10 people used to go out and blow up a train. Usually we were blowing up trains going towards the front. And I was told this, that in the beginning, it -- they were blowing up the trains by -- by the weight of th -- that was blowing up. So the Germans put two, three wagons of sand in front of them, so it was blowing up the sand trains and they were slowing down. Because we try to put always mines in a place where there is a -- a bend, because then, in the beginning, if they were going fast, 1t was -- the whole train was going downhill. So they used slow down in the area, and -- and when they put sand, they were blowing up the sand and nothing happened, so there was a Jew -- the Jewish lieutenant, he came up with the idea that he was using hand grenades. The biyoke I don\u2019t know how it is called in - in -- in English, the place -- the thing which blows -- which s-starts the -- the hand grenade, used to unscrew it, make a -- make a -- a hole in -- in -- in a -- local places, he was finding a place which -- where they can put -- drill in metal. We were taking 50 kilo, or hundred pound bombs -- shells. These were plenty, which left from the Russian army, were drilling a hole, puttin -- put there -- screw in there the -- the handle from the hand grenade, open it, and through the ring, put this -- a wire through shmore -- in German how it is a -- So we were sitting hundred yards away, and we pulled it, it was blowing. So we -- we didn\u2019t have -- we di -- the le -- the -- the -- the fuel -- always when we saw a train, the first thing, you know, we\u2019re looking what -- what 1s in it. If there was some - so-somewhere petrol, they always blew it under the petrol, because this made it th-the whole train was going up in flames. If there were no petrol, we looked at the a ammunition. And if there -- the -- and the third choice was people. And if this was not a  so we used to blow up the -- the locomotive in order to -- so tha -- tha -- they wi -- they will have no locomotives. So this -- this was a choice of it. And the s -- each time another group was going with this device were used to blowing up -- blow up trains."

This was t -- for a certain time til -- after that the contact with Russia became -- with -- became stronger, and they sent people over to -- to us, and we build a -- in the -- in Alebotska, because we moved each time more towards -- toward west each time, we were in Alebotska forest, they rebuild -- there were two guys who were in our otriad who were -- one was a pilot who -- a former pilot, and the other was one who were working, who was working in a - on an airfield in ra -- in Russia. And they were in charge of -- and they chose me to help them because I was Polish -- speaking Polish for -- if we g -- went out into the local places. And we built a place where planes could land. And I remember the first plane - we were building fire -- we build fires between the two -- the fires, they could land, they landed in. And the first plane was -- bombed a city nearby, and then it -- it landed. And he brought us TNT, 200 gram pieces. And after they knew what -- why -- why they were small pieces of ta -- rather than one -- one large, because they wanted us to stop blowing up trains, but blow up the whole railroad, the railroad. The rails, simply blow. And we called it after that, concert. We go to -- for it -- to a concert. Why? Because used to go out- now not eight people [indecipherable], but the whole otriad which was 120 people. And going along 50 people on one side, 50 on the other side, and along the -- and since the Germans had cut the trees along the railroad on both side for a hundred yards, so that they could hear. And they build places where they had sitting eight - 10 people every - every few miles, guards. The -- we were walking, we yelled hurrah, they were scared and they were running away. And we were thr -- four people, I was one of the -- of them, who were -- who prepared before that, 200 gram of TNT, and a piece, and a wire, to which you lit the wire. And when it come here -- a-and when the fire hit the -- it was blowing  19 up. And it -- in this way, we blew up every -- a rail is approximately seven yards, about seven, eight yards. So each rail, we were blowing on four lines. So four guys were -- and four guys were going bi -- a-after me, and they were those who were -- this way to -- to lit these wires. So here we were -- we were still putting, and there -- and they was blowing boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So they called it our concert, we are going to play a con -- and this is how we were blowing up for five - 10 kilometers, and several of the otriads were doing it, so after that, we knew the next day, hey, the Red army will start an offensive. And indeed, this night, they were starting an offensive, and everything. No help could come to -- this was a -- their objective. They said that we will help them much more by blowing up the railroad -- the rails, than killing a few Germans, or -- or -- or killing wa -- or destroying one train."

And we knew we cannot fight, they came with tanks, and ya -- we\u2019re -- we didn\u2019t have the ammunition what they had. So we divided ourself into a small group of 10 people, and we said, when we survive, after -- in a months, we said, we\u2019ll meet here or here, in this place. And I remember our group of 10 people chose an island which was -- around it was marsh, so we knew a -- the Germans will be a-afraid to walk to the marsh, because when you start to walk in a marsh, and you start sinking, you had a funny fee -- you have in a funny feeling that you don\u2019t know when it will stop.

So if I sank to  21 the knee in the marsh, the heavy guys, or women were sinking to their -- their breast into the mud. So I chose a way to go, and went on the island. And we were there for eight days, they encircled us. The only food we had was blueberries. It was the only thing what we could eat. And you could hear the Germans talking, you could hear around the Ukrainians yelling in Ukrainian. When it became quiet, they went away, we decided we'll try, and again I was the leader out. We went out, and -- and I took three guys with me to go in ahead and the remaining were all -- and I remember in one place we came, we saw German soldiers. And I told them we don\u2019t shoot, but I send -- I\u2019m back to the main group and told them that we have here German soldier, because to run, we don\u2019t have the strength, we were too weak to run. Yes, we can kill these two -- three guys, and after that, we\u2019ll have to run.

After eight or days we were without food. And they went away, and then in the German papers, they published -- they showed once the paper, we were getting the paper from the -- from local people I remember, I got in German, I saw hey, I told our lieutenant, Vitezev was his name. \u201cYou are dead, they call you, they -- they had ru -- th-th-they killed you.\u201d So I told him he -- \u201cSo somewhere how do we show them that we are alive?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go out and blow a train up.\u201d \u201cYou are right.\u201d So we went and blew a train up.

I thought, hey, maybe we\u2019ll go there, if we\u2019ll be able to. So this was the idea of coming back.

Is there anybody from such place, such pla -- we used to go in to meet and talk, and everybody was trying to start a new life, what will be, I -- nobody knew. They brought us to Stettin, which was -- which was a German city emptied of Germans, but were Poles brought in. And they brought also Jews from -- from Russia. And as -- f-first time I saw again anti-Semitism, again. Openly were anti-Semitism. And I always thought - regretted, hey why did I return my -- my pistol? Why didn\u2019t I keep the pistol I took from  28 the first German officer I killed? Till a certain time, we were s-several months in -- in Stettin, and I heard that people are being moved, and moving out more east to Germany. And I -- accidentally I saw something written 1n the -- in Hebrew, on a -- and it was astonishing [indecipherable] in Hebrew, I went in, and I saw people were speaking Hebrew, and they ask me why I [indecipherable] I\u2019m a former partisan [indecipherable].

So they ask me if I can be with the children till they come -- until -- till Krakow. I told them, okay, I will, and - and this is where I -- when I heard already that Jewish people are being killed on the trains. This is where I regretted that the Polish partisan were stopping trains and killing Jews and Russians. And a matter of fact, one guy who survived the war from Berlin - from Minsk ghetto, and he was killed when he -- he came to his hometown to visit. Survived partisans and then came, he was killed by Poles. But this was the way how we  they took my two sisters to one way, and my mother, brothers, and my sister and me went the other way.

He said yes he\u2019s a- a survivor of here, and he thought that I am Jewish, so he -- where he is, he told me there is here a group of people who survived the war, and I don\u2019t know -- he didn\u2019t know yet what -- what will be, this was in -- m -- in the beginning, when ber -- when Berlin was taken. I remember I had a can -- a can with me of -- we were getting American food in cans, was -- and I had it, and I gave it to him. Oh, he thanked me.

From anybody from [indecipherable]. So I wanted to buy a ticket, they told me no, I am -- I am a for -- I am not a German. So how do I pay? Said, \u201cYou cannot pay this with foreign -- with dollars, because you are not ar -- a real foreigner.\u201d I cannot get a ticket. So there was another guy living also at a Polish Jew in my -- in my house, I ask him, \u201cHow do Jewish people travel to -- to West Germany?\u201d To -- the shortest distance was to Hanover. He told me there is here a foreign -- a foreigner -- a real foreigner. He told me buy dollars on the Black Market, and he told me where I can buy dollars, and 20 dollars for him. And for 20 dollars, he will pay for you. And then you\u2019ll be able to go. So, I went to him, he said yes, he\u2019 ll do it. I bought, I don\u2019t remember how -- remember how many dollars, was in 20 dollars for him. I pay -- and he paid for me a t-ticket, and I came on the plane from Berlin, and I remember they called me in. \u201cYou are a smuggler.\u201d I had to undress, and they -- the British, that\u2019s what it -- the British part of Berlin.

            "answer": "No, I -- but I understood after that what I -- actually I did not want to be a -- as a young man, I did not want to be a chemist. As a young man, I loved math, and I wanted to be a mathematician. In high school whenever -- every -- we had a free lessons, I used to go to my math professor. They -- all the kids were go -- were -- went out to play basketball, and I told him, hey, we have a free time, can you give my -- give me a math problem and- to solve? And I hoped one day to be a mathematician. But when I started -- and applied to college, I said hey, if I\u2019ll be a mathematician, what could it be? At that time the only thing what I could be is a teacher, in all, I did not want to be a teacher. Because I was earning money in high school by tutoring other people, and I thought, no, I don\u2019t want to do this. So close to it, science, I said, hey, chemistry -- chemistry, I -- maybe I'll be able one day to work in Vitezma Institute. So this influenced my decision to choose it. Yes, and after that I understood what I did during the war, how I blew up thing."

I devised a method simply by taking -- putting together shells from -- from various -- various types of shells, and in between a small piece of TNT, and blowing up this TNT, and this TNT were causing all the shells to explode, and -- and take down the whole bridge. This is -- this was my -- my invention, how -- how to do it."
