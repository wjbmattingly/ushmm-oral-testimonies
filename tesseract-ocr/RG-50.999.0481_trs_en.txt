>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson. I'm the host of the museum's public program First Person.
Thank you for joining us today. We are in our 15th year of the First Person program. Our First
Person today is Mr. Jacques Fein whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2014 season of First Person is made possible by the generosity of the Louis
Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Helena Rubinstein Foundation. We
are grateful for their sponsorship. And I'm pleased to let you know that Mr. Louis Smith is here
with us today.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who
share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each of our
First Person guests serve as a volunteer here at the museum. Our program will continue
through August. We have programs twice weekly on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The
Museum's website, www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming First
Person guests.

Anyone interested in keeping in touch with the Museum and its programs can
complete the Stay Connected card that you'll find in your program for today. You can either fill
the card out here or talk with one of the museum's representatives at the back of the theater
when our program closes. If you complete one, you'll receive an electronic copy of Jacques
Fein's biography so that you can remember and share his testimony when you leave here
today.

Jacques will share with us his First Person account of his experience during the

Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. The life stories of Holocaust survivors
transcend the decades. What you are about to hear from Jacques is one individual's account
of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.
Bear with me.

Jacques was born Jacques Karpik in Paris, France, October 10, 1938. His parents,
Szmul and Rozja, were born in Poland in the 1910s but relocated to France. The arrow on this
map of France points to Paris.

Germany invaded France in May 1940. The next month, June 1940, France signed
an Armistice with Germany. Under the terms of the Armistice Northern France, including
Paris, came under German rule and Southern France remained unoccupied. Here we have a
group portrait of the Karpik family with an aunt, uncle and cousins taken shortly after German
invasion of France. Jacques's parents are on the left. And Jacques is seated in the middle on
the first row.

In this picture taken in late 1941, Jacques is pictured with his mother Rozja and his
younger sister Annette. After Germany invaded France, Jacques and his sister were hidden
with the Bocahuts. Here we see a portrait of Jacques and his sister who were in hiding with a
family at the time. Jacques stands in front of Suzanne Bocahut and Annette is in front of
Marcel Bocahut.

While Jacques and Annette were in hiding, their parents were deported to transit
camps and then to Auschwitz. Pictured here are prisoners from the Pithiviers camp.
Jacques's father Szmul is the man smoking the cigarette on your right.

After the war, Jacques and Annette were placed in orphanages then later adopted
by an American couple, Harry and Rose Fein. We close our slide show with Jacques’ passport
photo from 1948.

After their adoption by the Feins in 1948, Jacques and Annette began their new life
in the United States growing up in New Jersey. Jacques attended Clark University in
Massachusetts majoring in math. After attending graduate school at N.Y.U., he began his
career as a computer scientist in the aerospace industry starting with Martin Marietta in
Baltimore. He recently retired in the same field after 38 years with Computer Science
Corporation or CSC.

Jacques has a daughter Rachel and a son Matthew from his first marriage. In 1986
he married his second wife, Judee Iliff, wnose daughter Laura and her husband David opened
a very successful ice cream parlor in Baltimore, the Charmery. Jacques and Judee have four
grandchildren. Maggie was born June 27, 2014, so just recently. Judee and Jacques live in
Elkridge, Maryland, about midway between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. Judee is here
today with Jacques. If you don't mind waving your hand so people know you're down here.
And also joining Judee and Jacques today are their friends Lynn Warshaw of Elkridge,
Maryland, Don and Lynn Waldman of Hamilton, New York, and Michelle Ostroff, Executive
Director of Jewish Federation of Howard County.

In 1983 Jacques attended the American gathering of Jewish survivors of the
Holocaust where he found other survivors who were children during the war. After that he and
others formed the organization Washington/Baltimore Survivors of the Holocaust-Last

Generation. Jacques is former president of the Jewish Federation of Howard County,
Maryland, and is very active as a volunteer in his community. In 2011, Jacques was
recognized as the Howard County Volunteer of the Year. The Howard County Volunteer of the
Year coordinator said about Jacques at that time, "He was affected at such a young age. He
took a terrible thing and has done greatness with it.". Jacques became Co-President of OSE-
USA, an organization -- this past January -- that we will learn more about later. On June 6,
Steve and Judee went to the 70th Anniversary of D-Day at the World War II memorial where
he was able, as Jacques said, “to thank a few Normandy veterans for saving not only my life
but the lives of the world.”

Jacques volunteers here at this museum where since his retirement you will find him
at the Donors Desk on Thursdays. Jacques volunteers because years ago he was saved by
strangers and with the help of the Jewish community and now, he says, it's payback time.

With that I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Jacques
Fein.

[Applause]

Jacques, welcome. Thank you so much for your willingness to be our First Person
today. | think this is the fourth time you've been with us over the last four or five years.

Let’s get started because you have an awful lot to share with us in a short time.

World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland. The
following May, May 1940, Germany invaded France. You were just 1 1/2 years old at the time.
Before you turn to the war years, please tell us what you can about your parents and what their

life may have been like in pre-war Paris knowing that because you were so young you don't
have memories of those early years but you've learned some things in the years since.
>> Jacques Fein: Well, | was 11 months old when World War II started. | was put in hiding
when | was about 2 years old. Strictly speaking, | do not remember my parents at all. | know |
lived with them but that's about it. So how do | know anything about my parents? Well, in
1984 | found out that | had a cousin living in Paris who lived with us as a family. She sent me
a letter and wrote about nine pages of my history. That was the first time | really found out any
significant information about my family.

As she says here -- I'll paraphrase it -- my parents who had come from Poland to
escape anti-Semitism came to Paris in the early 1930s. As you know, once World War Il
started, the anti-Semitism did not disappear. It got worse. And it's still going on. But that's
another issue. And what she tells me is that my parents were poor people, lived with other
Polish foreigners. And they worked in the clothing industry. They took care of their kids, my
sister and I, like all parents did. But in 1941 or so my father was taken to a transit camp,
Pithiviers.
>> Bill Benson: Before we talk about that, you know that they were in the clothing industry.
>> Jacques Fein: | know --
>> Bill Benson: Because of what you've read. Absolutely. Do you have any idea what life
may have been like for Polish Jews who had come to Paris?
>> Jacques Fein: That's a good question, but I'll have to deal with it for next year. | have to
research it. I'm pretty sure they were very poor. They lived in the poor section of Paris, in the

outer sections. That's all | know.
>> Bill Benson: Have you learned whether or not you had an extended family, cousins, aunts,
uncles?
>> Jacques Fein: | did have aunts and uncles. In that picture where you saw my parents and
my cousins, my father was on the left and my sister was on the lower right. But | did have
other relatives. What happened was a lot of them did not survive. They were murdered at
Auschwitz.
>> Bill Benson: And you've been able to learn that in the years since the war.
>> Jacques Fein: Right.
>> Bill Benson: | know that you're beginning to tell us --
>> Jacques Fein: My First Family.
>> Bill Benson: Yeah. We'll talk more about what you've learned about what happened to
your parents. You started to tell us about the transit camp. | know that most of the details
about your parents being rounded up and sent to camps and later deported are pretty much
unknown to you, but as you said, you believe your father was taken in 1941 and your mother
the following year, in July of 1942. Have you been able to learn anything about the
circumstances in which your father was rounded up and taken? And you know for a fact that
he --
>> Jacques Fein: In simple terms -- well, Paris was ground zero for the Jews of France and
especially Paris because most of the Jews lived in Paris. So as far as Jewish people being
deported eventually to Auschwitz, the foreign men were first taken -- sorry, foreign Jewish men

were first taken. And then in July --
>> Bill Benson: That would have been your father.
>> Jacques Fein: My cousin's letter says -- if | could read it. Yeah, he was taken with Sara's
father in May 1941 to Pithiviers, a transit camp south of Paris.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what a transit camp -- what does that mean?
>> Jacques Fein: It means it's a place where people were being sent as a holding place for
the next step. The French police, the French government, in coordination enforced by the
German government knew that the next step was Auschwitz, going by trains and all.
>> Bill Benson: As you said, so a holding camp.
>> Jacques Fein: My mother went to Drancy, one worse than Pithiviers.
>> Bill Benson: What have you learned about Pithiviers?
>> Jacques Fein: Not too much except it was mostly for men.
>> Bill Benson: And close to Paris.
>> Jacques Fein: The southern part of Paris.
>> Bill Benson: How are you able to get the photograph of your father that we saw?
>> Jacques Fein: Well, we'll have to go fast forward.
>> Bill Benson: We can come back to that if you want.
>> Jacques Fein: Since you asked me that question. In 1984, | went to -- | found out | had a
cousin living in Paris for the first time in my life, a blood cousin. So | went with my kids to Paris
to visit them. And then she gave me a letter. Before | went, she wrote me a letter that she
gave me some pictures of my family at that time.

>> Bill Benson: So photos that were sent to her.
>> Jacques Fein: Right. So 1973 -- 1984 -- | came here in 1948 so 36 years after | came to
the United States.
>> Bill Benson: Was that the first photo you had seen of your father?
>> Jacques Fein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Wow.
>> Jacques Fein: Just as an aside, my sister is two years younger than |. Somehow she
knew about my cousins living in Paris. How | found out more about that, April 1983 there was
a gathering in the United States of American-Jewish Holocaust survivors in Washington. |
went. Then | opened up and | tried to figure out the next -- you know, what had happened the
first six years of my life.
>> Bill Benson: And I'm hoping that before we end today you might say more about what that
was like for you to begin learning those things about your family all of these years later. But
we'll come back to that.

From what you know after your father was taken and before your mother was also
caught in a German roundup, before she went somehow she was able to arrange for you and
your sister to be hidden with this French Catholic family. What do you know -- before we turn
to going into hiding, what do you know about the roundup that your mother was taken in?
>> Jacques Fein: They were forced to do that. The Jews had to register with the authorities.
The poor foreign Jews lived in a certain section of Paris, so they knew where they were.
People followed along. And brutally. It wasn't saying, hey, let's walk to this transit camp.

They just shoved them, put them in trucks and took kids in a terrible manner. There's a movie,
“La Rafle,” part of it you can see the process.
>> Bill Benson: And that particular film was about probably the single largest roundup of Jews
in France ever. Tell us a little bit about that. That was the subject --
>> Jacques Fein: That was the biggest roundup. But basically there were other roundups. It
wasn't the only one. | believe my mother was taken right around that time. I'm not quite sure.
>> Bill Benson: | think -- you don't think she was taken in the big one in which 13 --
>> Jacques Fein: | don't think so; around that time, ‘42, ‘43.
>> Bill Benson: To spend a moment on the Velodrome roundup, you told me some 13,000
Jews were round up and then deported to transit camp and then off to places like Auschwitz.
So what have you learned about your mother's roundup? | think you think she may have been
captured or grabbed on the Metro system?
>> Jacques Fein: Well, two things. First of all, | was already in hiding with my sister in 1941 or
‘42, early ‘42. | believe and I'm pretty sure that my mother would visit us, my sister and I, in
secret. But at that time you also had to wear -- Jews had to wear a yellow star. And she
probably did. And from what | understand, when | visited family who hid me, visited them in
1984 or 85 -- | forgot exactly. It seems that she forgot to wear her yellow star and she
panicked in the Metro. And she was then taken.
>> Bill Benson: On the Metro.
>> Jacques Fein: So people were scared. They were terrified. They didn't believe what was
happening.

>> Bill Benson: And from what you know, as you said a moment ago, she was taken to a
different camp than your father.
>> Jacques Fein: It was cold and terrible during that time.
>> Bill Benson: Have you learned anything more about what Drancy was like?
>> Jacques Fein: Just from reading. There was a terribly cold -- the worst you can imagine. It
wasn't a concentration camp. It was where people were -- there were hardly any bathroom
facilities, hardly any food, hardly any water, hardly any life.
>> Bill Benson: Thousands of people crammed into these camps. You know and you've
learned that your parents were eventually deported to Auschwitz where they were murdered.
Do you know when they were taken to Auschwitz and how long they were there before they
were killed?
>> Jacques Fein: How long I'm not quite sure, but my father was taken -- well, there were
different convoys, trains, going from Paris to Auschwitz. There were maybe 50, 60 convoys.
So my father was taken under convoy number 4, which was in July 1941. And my mother,
convoy number 58 or something, 51, which was in 1943, | believe. How she survived two
years -- I'm not quite sure exactly when she was taken to Drancy.
>> Bill Benson: Right. And, of course, what you were just implying a moment ago is that the
Nazis kept such meticulous records that you actually know the number of the convoys. You've
learned that, that your parents were taken on.
>> Jacques Fein: Also, | was reading the letter that my cousin sent to me in January 1984.
And she specified -- she had a -- she was five years older than | was. So if | was 3 or 4 years

old, 3 years old in 1941, she was 8 years old. And she has a pretty good memory. She told
me exactly the convoys that my father was in and my mother.
>> Bill Benson: As you explained to us a moment ago, before your mother was taken she
somehow was able to arrange for you and Annette to go into hiding with the Bocahut family.
And you would remain with them until the end of the war. Tell us what you can about the
Bocahuts and what your life was like with them to the extent that you know and if you know
anything at all about how your mother may have been able to arrange for you to go into hiding
with the Bocahuts.
>> Jacques Fein: How did | get into hiding? In Paris there was a French organization called
Oeuvres de Secours aux Enfants whose mission was to save as many Jewish kids as
possible. They probably saved about 10,000 kids or so. So they, with the cooperation of my
parents, or my mother definitely, agreed to put me in hiding. For any parent to say, ok, my
child, you're going to go in hiding it's got to be a very difficult decision.
>> Bill Benson: Unimaginable, | imagine, for most of us.
>> Jacques Fein: So from that point my mother and father were heroes. They resisted the
persecution of Jews. So it was a key Jewish organization, OSE. As you mentioned, before |
became co-President. So fast forward into the last 20 years. In 1994, we formed -- we, the
kids who were chosen during the war and saved by OSE, formed OSE-USA. It's like a
network. And what we do also is raise money and send money to OSE in Paris.
>> Bill Benson: So is OSE still saving kids today?
>> Jacques Fein: Well, it's different. It's a special service agency. It has a different mission

than it did during the war.
>> Bill Benson: Does it run orphanages today?
>> Jacques Fein: A few. But in France it's like a social agency. It expands outside of France
into Israel and Morocco and Northern Africa.
>> Bill Benson: So your mother somehow or possibly your father were able to work with OSE,
find a hiding place for you. Tell us about the Bocahut family.
>> Jacques Fein: | must have been there roughly 1941. | hid with my sister. My sister was
born in August 1940. | lived there. | don't recall any terrible memories over that time; except |
know we had to be very quiet. The family took care of us. And | remember two or three
incidents. One day my foster father put my sister and | in a ditch with a blanket over us. And |
could see -- | still can see it now. Maybe 100 yards away, soldiers with guns with dogs. And
obviously they were looking for Jews or resistant fighters, people of that nature.
>> Bill Benson: And that is one of the early memories that you have.
>> Jacques Fein: One of my early memories. Another time for whatever reason | was sick, |
had an earache. | was sent to a hospital in Paris. | found out later that the father took me out
as quickly as possible from the hospital. And when | went to visit the family in 1984 or so, they
told me that hospital was raided by the German police or the French police. So had he not
done what he did, | would never be here today.
>> Bill Benson: Right.
>> Jacques Fein: And again, it wasn't as if | was living in fear because -- the other thing, | was
too young to understand what was going on. Nobody -- we didn't have television, internet.

The family was not telling me, hey, this is the war going on; this is what's happening.
>> Bill Benson: Right. And you wouldn't know that. I'm sure they protected you for as much
as possible. But as you said a moment ago, you do remember an atmosphere of having to
remain quiet. Is there anything more you can say about that?
>> Jacques Fein: Well, that was the nature of the time of being in hiding. You could not
divulge -- the family could not divulge who was being hidden or else that family would have
been killed immediately. And | would never be here. Not only that, that family, but their kids.
Fortunately the neighbors were not any trouble. So that's my second family.
>> Bill Benson: The Bocahuts. That's right. Have you learned anything from your subsequent
visits about the Bocahut family to have any insight as to how they would explain the presence
of two youngsters in their house?
>> Jacques Fein: Well, this is very tough. | left their place after the war. The war was ending
in Paris, in France, rather, August 1944. It ended May 8, 1945. | was taken out of that home.
The key thing after that was the particular relationship between them and | because it would
have been impossible. The mission after that was to try to reunite me and my sister with my
family. It would have been very difficult given all the dynamics.
>> Bill Benson: For the period you were with the Bocahuts, almost four years, | believe, they
raised you as Catholics. Do you know anything about that?
>> Jacques Fein: All | know | was baptized. | don't remember any prayers. | don't remember
anything --
>> Bill Benson: But they did take you --

>> Jacques Fein: According to my records. By the way, the records that | have, some of the
records -- the OSE Paris had fantastic records. And | visited them in 1984. And | copied a
bunch of records that they had. | had some from living in New Jersey but | was able to create
part of my history.
>> Bill Benson: From the records and from conversations with the children and the Bocahuts
what do you know about their family?
>> Jacques Fein: They were good people, in very simple terms. When Judee and | visited
them -- | forget what day it was, 2000 or so. They were very simple people. | think they said it
was the right thing to do. And also, Paris being ground Zero is different than living on a farm in
the countryside. Less dangerous but still had to be careful.
>> Bill Benson: At great risk themselves.
>> Jacques Fein: Right.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know did they hide any other Jewish children?
>> Jacques Fein: | believe they did but I'm not sure. I'm not really sure.
>> Bill Benson: Your sister Annette, of course, was | think almost two years younger than you.
Has she learned from you what you know about the Bocahuts?
>> Jacques Fein: Basically, my sister, two years younger than I, she moved to Israel in 1962.
She didn't deal with her hiding or the Holocaust. It didn't really happen until -- our groups have
conferences once a year. | forgot which year it was, maybe 2008 or 2009, she came to a
meeting and then realized that she was in the Holocaust in hiding. She kind of sort of opened
up more about what had happened to her.

>> Bill Benson: And no doubt learned a great deal from you from the research that you've
done.
>> Jacques Fein: | hope so.
>> Bill Benson: So as you said, Jacques, you lived with the Bocahuts until the war near Paris
and in France ended in August 1944. You were not quite 6, | think, when D-Day occurred, and
you were 6 1/2 when the war itself was over. As a 6-year-old, do you have any memories --
>> Jacques Fein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Jacques Fein: Of the war.
>> Bill Benson: Of the war.
>> Jacques Fein: So the one thing | remember, it must have been obviously after the
liberation of Paris or it could have been after the war ended. It was a hot summer day. All the
townspeople -- it was a place called Vers-Galant, went out to the highway to the main road. All
we saw was the Americans -- the allied troops coming in, in their tanks and waving flags and
throwing candy to all the kids. And everybody was shouting. | didn't Know it was the end of
the war.
>> Bill Benson: Right. You knew candy was being thrown.
>> Jacques Fein: Hershey bars candy. It was very -- people were shouting.
>> Bill Benson: And that you do remember.
>> Jacques Fein: Most definitely remember that.
>> Bill Benson: As you said, the war for you and where you were living at that time was over

in August of 1944. Of course, it would continue in Europe until May 1945. When the war
ended, OSE, the organization that had put you into hiding with the Bocahuts, removed you
from their home and took you to an orphanage. And later you and Annette were moved to yet
another orphanage where you would stay until 1948. Tell us what you know about the
circumstances of them coming in and saying now we've got to take Jacques and Annette and
take them elsewhere.
>> Jacques Fein: Getting out I'm not quite sure what happened. | was 6 years old. My sister
was 4. At that age you follow the program. And that was the plan. | didn't really have any
other options. So we were first put in an orphanage near the coast of Brittany. People
sometimes think of orphanages as being terrible and lonely places, kids. Well, this was exactly
the opposite. Because we came out of the hiding, number one. And we learned about -- we
were fed. We played with kids. So it was very good for us. So that was my third family.
Because then we went to another orphanage outside of Paris and the same thing. But we
learned more. We knew more about what was happening. And that was my fourth family.
>> Bill Benson: The second orphanage. Do you have any recollection of what it was like for
you to be taken from the Bocahut family to move from there?
>> Jacques Fein: | don't remember. | remember both orphanages. One was by the coast of
Brittany, going to the ocean and learning. And the other thing is, all the kids who were there
were in the same situation. Most of us knew that our parents or our family were no longer
alive. So everybody was in the same boat, so to speak. It's not like one had more money or
less money or one had parents living and others didn't.

>> Bill Benson: So all the kids, as you said, were in the same boat.
>> Jacques Fein: The same situation.
>> Bill Benson: The first orphanage you went to, the one in Brittany, | think you were there a
short period.
>> Jacques Fein: About a year.
>> Bill Benson: And then went to, | think, stayed at Taverny until 1948. Do you have many
more memories of that? And you described it to me as almost like a chateau. Tell us about it.
>> Jacques Fein: It was a chateau. That's why.
>> Bill Benson: That's why you called it that. Ok.

[Laughter]
>> Jacques Fein: Exactly. | got there roughly in the early ‘47, | believe, and left in 19 --
October ‘48. As a matter of fact, after the war ended, many teenagers that age had been in
Buchenwald. They were sent to Taverny because it was a very orthodox -- Jewish orphanage
at that time. | never was there at the same time that he was.
>> Bill Benson: You came in a later group.
>> Jacques Fein: About a year, year and a half later. But, again, the main thing is we were all
in the same situation and we played. It was good to us.
>> Bill Benson: It's also a place where you were really reestablished with your Jewish identity.
Can you tell us a little bit about that, to the extent you remember? Again, you were very
young.
>> Jacques Fein: Well, while | was in hiding | don't know what we did, but | was baptized. I'm

sure we didn't have any Friday night Shabbat services.
>> Bill Benson: Not likely.
>> Jacques Fein: I'm sure. And I'm sure | didn't know anything about being Jewish. But once
we were out, Shabbat service was very important. The Jewish holidays was very important.
I'm not quite sure about learning Hebrew and being with other Jewish kids and being
supervised by the staff who was mostly Jewish.
>> Bill Benson: And what was OSE's role with these two homes?
>> Jacques Fein: They had two homes but they had many other homes.
>> Bill Benson: They were operated by OSE.
>> Jacques Fein: Right. During the war they were in secret, resisting the Germans as much
as they could. And after the war -- | forgot how many orphanages they had; unfortunately quite
a number because many kids had no more parents.

So at that time, especially when we went to Taverny, they were reuniting me with my
aunts and -- reuniting me with my aunts and uncles would have been impossible. Some of
them had come back from Auschwitz. They had their own kids to take care of. They could not
take care of two more kids. The situation would have been extremely difficult.
>> Bill Benson: Do you know if the OSE folks, did they attempt to try to find if there were living
relatives?
>> Jacques Fein: I'm sure they did. But I'm not quite sure how they were able to connect all
the dots. But, again, as you said, the Germans kept pretty detailed records. And that was
part --

>> Bill Benson: Right. And as it turned out, OSE kept very detailed files. | hope we'll talk a
little bit more about that in a minute.

Of course, this is Postwar France. Do you have any idea what conditions were like?
Was food scarce in those times?
>> Jacques Fein: | could read history, but where | was --
>> Bill Benson: Not an issue?
>> Jacques Fein: It was not an issue. I'm sure we had enough food for the kids. And maybe
it wasn't enough. The fact that we came out of hiding, playing, eating and all of that, was not
super, duper important.
>> Bill Benson: Jacques, do you know at what point you understood that your natural born
parents -- you would not see them again?
>> Jacques Fein: That's a good question. | probably knew by the time | was in the
orphanages in 1947, ‘46. But | don't remember the moment.
>> Bill Benson: And, of course, | know you're going to tell us in a moment about being
adopted by the Feins family. Tell us about that. That was 1948. This American couple, the
Feins, come to the home where you were.
>> Jacques Fein: First of all, my parents, my adoptive parents, they couldn't have any
children. They were actually from Russia. They came to the United States in 1920s. She
could not have any children. As you know, by 1945, ‘48, there were a lot of kids available in --
orphans in France. They were very well connected to the Jewish organizations of New Jersey
and New York. They were not religious, but they were connected to the religion and the

organizations. | had no idea why but they wound up going to the orphanage where | was,
Taverny, with my sister. They visited there. | remember seeing them. We were playing, |
think. From what | understand, they saw my sister. She was two years younger. Probably
when they came maybe she was 6 1/2, 7. They wanted her. The Director of the orphanage
said good. But there was a but.

[Laughter]
They said it's a package of two. So they obviously agreed.
>> Bill Benson: Did they come back to the United States and then return to get you?
>> Jacques Fein: They came to France, to the orphanage. | think we visited with them in a
hotel in Paris. They went back to the United States. | don't remember if they came back
again. But October 8, 1948, we left the orphanage, which was my fourth home, by the way.
And we went to Marseille and then to the United States. Arrived in -- October 8, 1948.
>> Bill Benson: How did you come to the United States?
>> Jacques Fein: By boat.
>> Bill Benson: You came by ship.
>> Jacques Fein: If you remember -- | was at a retreat for our federation board last
September. And a young lady who was in charge said, "When you were 10 years old, what did
want to be?" So everybody said | want to be a doctor, a nurse, a teacher. And | said | was on
a boat from France to the United States and all | wanted to know was what my life was going
to be here.
>> Bill Benson: That's what you thought about. Do you remember that trip?

>> Jacques Fein: Oh, it was a great trip. | learned how to play chess, among other things.
We had a chaperon, four or five of us. | had a French beret, which | lost in the ocean
somewhere.
>> Bill Benson: Blew off your head into the sea.
>> Jacques Fein: It was a windy day. | had my 10th birthday on that ship. As we were
approaching New York, a lot of people went to the side. And | was wondering why. It was a
foggy day. | realized they were looking -- they saw the Statue of Liberty. And that was the
moment that we arrived.
>> Bill Benson: Do you remember seeing the Statue of Liberty?
>> Jacques Fein: It would be nice to say yes, but. It was very foggy.
>> Bill Benson: It was foggy. Ok. So you dock in New York and here are the Feins.
>> Jacques Fein: They picked us up, | think with some other couple. As a matter of fact, and
Judee knows, they had a friend that went with them. And he took a 35-millimeter film which we
had and converted to a CD, aDVD. You could see us, my sister and I, coming off the boat.
Literally coming off the boat. And people were wearing hats. You know, in those days --
>> Bill Benson: 1948.
>> Jacques Fein: It was a different time in terms of clothing.
>> Bill Benson: So you have the footage of that today.
>> Jacques Fein: We have the footage.
>> Bill Benson: That's fabulous. That's fabulous.

The doctor came over -- in those days, you know, having a doctor coming home was
more natural. He spoke English. And | spoke French. We had a neighbor who spoke French.
| recovered.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: Jacques, you mentioned several times the number of families: your natural
parents, the Bocahuts, the two homes in France, and then, of course, the United States with
the Feins. That's a lot of change, a huge amount. For most of us, it would be very difficult to
even imagine what that's like. What do you recall of not only you now have a fifth family but
you're an entirely different world.
>> Jacques Fein: Actually six or five and a half.
>> Bill Benson: Now you're in a whole new world.
>> Jacques Fein: Well, coming here, what we had to do, obviously, we assimilated the United
States culture, language number one; number two, my parents, family. Schooling, | was 10
years old when | came to the United States. My parents were fortunately well-to-do. They put
me in a private school. When | was 10, | started in the first grade because of my English.
>> Bill Benson: You're in there with first graders, 10 years old.
>> Jacques Fein: Right. But | managed to skip, skip, skip. Eventually | made up the grades
and graduated college -- high school at the right time.

>> Bill Benson: And went on to remarkable education. What was that like for you?
>> Jacques Fein: It was kind of strange. Our granddaughter was adopted when she was
literally a baby. So she didn't know anything else. To be adopted at the age of 10 is not easy
because you know there's a big difference. You know you had a history. So that was quite a
bit of a difference.
>> Bill Benson: Not just a history; is a very complex, convoluted, with much upheaval and loss
so it must have been just an extraordinary transition.
>> Jacques Fein: So given everything | guess | turned out to be ok. [Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: You did. If you don't mind, I'm going to skip around with a couple of things |
wanted to ask you about.
>> Jacques Fein: Before we go -- | need to say hi to my friend Regina who volunteers at the
museum. She's also a survivor who survived Auschwitz. She's about 90 years old, roughly 90
years old. She's great.
[Applause]
And she lives in Columbia, where we live. We know her daughter. Michelle knows her. She's
a great part of the Holocaust community here, Montgomery County and Howard County.
>> Bill Benson: We've had Regina speak on our First Person earlier this year.
>> Jacques Fein: And she's volunteering today at the Donors Desk. But because I'm here
and we're friends. Right?
[Laughter]
Sorry about your age.

[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: Jacques, tell us about Felice.
>> Jacques Fein: The orphanage. When | came to the United States in 1948, we had about
60, 70 kids of my age-group. At the beginning they wrote me letters. And one of them was
Felice; wrote me a letter, missed me, wanted to know how it was in the United States. In the
meantime my parents would send money to the OSE, to the orphanage. She told me that with
the money that they received, they went to a circus in Paris. They wanted you to know how
things were going.

So skimming forward to April 1983, the gathering of American-Jewish Holocaust
survivors here in Washington. There was a breakup of tables: Germany, Hungary, France, of
course. So! went to the French table. There was somebody put a sign OSE here. And a few
of us went there. When you talk to people, you play like geography so she said her name is
Felice. | said, | know Felice; | have a letter from someone named Felice. | lived in Columbia,
Maryland, at the time. So! went home 30 miles, brought back the letter, showed it to this
Felice. And that was her.
>> Bill Benson: That was her. Written in 1948 and here it is 1983. Wow.
>> Jacques Fein: She screamed. It was unbelievable. And not only that, we lived in Newark,
New Jersey and Union, New Jersey. And she was living in Linden, New Jersey, which was
very close by.
>> Bill Benson: And you didn't know that at the time.
>> Jacques Fein: So that's one of the power of the networks, the OSE-USA networks, our

group's network. You never know who you're going to meet from the past.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us a little bit more about the kinds of things you've learned from reading
the OSE records about your case, if you will. They had a dossier on Annette and on Jacques.
What kinds of things did you learn?
>> Jacques Fein: The thing that we learned really is that for those of us who were saved by
the OSE, we want to support them. So that's the main thing. We have the OSE-USA group.
>> Bill Benson: Which you're now President of.
>> Jacques Fein: Co-President. The Co-President is a -- not a survivor, per se, but the child
of a survivor. So that's what | really learned. That's very important to remember what
happened in the past, not to forget. They are still operating. It's a completely different mission
than it was in the ‘40s.
>> Bill Benson: What was it like for you the first time you went to a meeting where there were
other survivors who had been children like you?
>> Jacques Fein: Well, let's see. In the late “70s -- and Regina knows -- there was a group in
the Washington area, shalom group, called Shalom. That was compromised of survivors, but
they were mostly survivors who had lived, who had survived concentration camps or ghettos. |
never went to a concentration camp. | go to the Donors Desk and people want to know
where's my number. Had | gone to a concentration camp, | would have -- | was too young to
do anything.
So when you meet people, you connect immediately. You don't have to say too
much. They know exactly what you're going to say. | never met my parents. | don't have to

continue. They know what | mean.
>> Bill Benson: They know what you experienced, what you went through.
>> Jacques Fein: Right.
>> Bill Benson: And, of course, you remained not only active in the organization, you've
helped to build a more local organization in the years since. You are now very involved as a
Co--President of OSE, and you continued to learn things that you hadn't known before. Do
you still have any connection with the Bocahuts today, any family?
>> Jacques Fein: No. First of all, once we left the orphanage, their home, we broke up the
relationship. It was almost necessary. | don't have anything except for the time we visited.
The reason | was able to visit was because the OSE records were so accurate. | went to their
home -- Judee and | went to their home with my cousin who lives in Paris. And the address |
think was 146. They had moved to 148, next door.
[Laughter]
Maybe the numbers were wrong originally. The reason | quit the board because | became
Co-President of the organization. You understand.
[Laughter]
>> Bill Benson: | think we have time to turn to our audience.
>> Jacques Fein: One more thing.
>> Bill Benson: Ok.
>> Jacques Fein: Before | forget. Lynn came with us. We went on the Metro, the MARC train
from Elkridge, Maryland, to here. For the first time in years the power line broke down and we

couldn't go anyplace. We were going to go by taxi. But Don and Lynn from Hamilton, New
York, were staying in our development. We called them. They were driving because they
have relatives in Virginia. They were just about to leave. They picked us up and we got here
by 10:30 without any problem. If it wasn't for them -- I'm sure we would have made it, but |
have no idea what time we would have been here. You deserve a special thank you.
>> Bill Benson: We're glad you rescued him today and got him here.
>> Jacques Fein: And my wife was the one -- Judee was the one who said, "Call Don and
Lynn." | said, go ahead. Whatever she wants.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you. Let’s turn to our audience and see if our audience has any
questions they'd like to ask of you. We have one hand shot up already. If you wait until we get
a microphone. It's being passed to you now. Make questions as brief as you can. If | need to
repeat it so everybody hears it, including Jacques, I'll do that. If it's brief, that will help us.
>> Do you know if the OSE, is that the organization that was like Sara's train where they were
sending children to be adopted? | didn't know if that was the organization.
>> Bill Benson: The Kindertransport?
>> Yes. Were they connected?
>> Jacques Fein: It's somewhat similar. But the Kindertransport were kids from Austria and
Germany, about 10,000 sent to England. England opened up its doors to them. The OSE
group was part of France. They did save kids from Austria and Germany. Some of them were
sent to actually to France. So it's somewhat similar. But it was basically saving kids, staying in
France.

>> Bill Benson: About 10,000 kids on the Kindertransport were saved.
>> Jacques Fein: Yeah.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you. Do we have another question from our audience? Gentleman
right here. We got the microphone coming to you here.
>> After you left the Bocahut family, how were you able to reconnect with your Jewish identity?
And how important is it to you now?
>> Jacques Fein: The second part is very important. I've been involved, as people know here,
with the Jewish community and the non-Jewish community also. But | definitely am connected
with the Jewish community.

How did | connect? At that time we were all in hiding, my sister and |. | didn't know
anything about what religion we were doing, but | was baptized according to my records. But
the OSE people, when they took us out, their prime mission was since they could not reunite
us with our family was to make sure that we were -- reconnect us with our Judaism. So by
going to services, Jewish religion, the holidays, and religious school to some degree. And the
regular school. | went to a regular school in Taverny with the other kids, the kids that were
living in Taverny, | assume.
>> Bill Benson: So it was a French public school for education.
>> Jacques Fein: Right. So that was their mission, also to reconnect us with our Judaism.
Good question.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you. A question over here.
>> What advice would you give to anyone who's interested in adopting or fostering a young

child?
>> Bill Benson: Interesting question. What advice would you give to somebody considering
adopting or fostering a young child?
>> Jacques Fein: Well, my son and his wife adopted a baby, basically, from scratch -- the
beginning.
[Laughter]
From day one. And they did some research. My parents adopted me. There's no way of
knowing how it's going to work out. They need to be supportive of who they adopt. I'm sure
there have been cases where adoption doesn't work. | was very lucky. Because | was
adopted at the age of 10; | had a major history that | knew about.

I'm not a psychologist, but to support whoever you're getting. I've heard recently that
kids who were adopted from Russia but they were not in top health and they sent them back.
That's like a no-no.
>> Bill Benson: Thanks, Jacques. Thank you for that. We have a question right here.
>> You said that your sister didn't necessarily consider herself having been in the Holocaust.
ls that common for people who are in your sort of situation, where they weren't in camps?
>> Bill Benson: Just so people in the back -- the question was -- you commented on your
sister didn't think of herself so much as a Survivor. The question is: Was that common with
people who had been through similar circumstances as you and your sister?
>> Jacques Fein: Well, typically speaking -- when | ask people — say: The Holocaust, what
comes to your mind? People say concentration camps, horrible, you know, no way of

surviving concentration camps, absolutely unbearable, ghettos. But we were so young. And in
hiding some people didn't think they were survivors. So it really didn't happen until 40 years in
the United States. And 40 years is a magic number in life, mid-life crisis. You want to know
what's happening to you. Like Moses took the Jews -- 40 years. Whenever he was. Into the
promised land.

So the answer is, yes. A lot of people of that age didn't think they were survivors but
eventually they dealt with it. | think my sister is dealing with it better.
>> Bill Benson: When you think about the losses for you, the bottom line is your parents were
taken from you and murdered in Auschwitz. Your life was constant upheaval for years after
that until you settled in the United States.
>> Jacques Fein: The other thing is in terms of different families, | was married once. My fifth
family. And then because of Judee is my sixth family and our family.
>> Bill Benson: | think that we've got one more question and then we're going to close our
program. I'll turn back to Jacques to close it ina moment. Young man in the green shirt in the
middle. A microphone for him?
>> What was your first feeling or thought when you found out about your history, about the
war, and hiding, and your parents? What was your first feeling?
>> Bill Benson: What was your first feeling when you found out what you had been through?
>> Jacques Fein: That is a good question. Unfortunately the only answer | have is | really
don't remember how | felt at that time. | could have been 7 years old or 9 years old.
Remember, | didn't have any family. | was basically, from a feeling point of view, relationship

point of view, we were on our own. So there was nobody to tell me or remind me of what had
happened. But | do know what happened. And my feeling is that a lot of people went through
horrible, horrible conditions. And some of us survived. Some did not.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you for that question. We're going to close in a moment. | want to
thank all of you for being here with us for First Person. We'll have First Person programs each
Wednesday and Thursday until the middle of August. Our website has information about the
upcoming programs as well as information will be posted for our program in 2015. So we hope
very much that you might have the opportunity to come back and join us.

It's our tradition at First Person that our First Person gets the last word. So | will turn
back to Jacques to close our program in just a moment. | want to mention two things before |
do that. When Jacques's finished, can you stay for a few minutes for people who have other
questions?
>> Jacques Fein: Oh, yeah.
>> Bill Benson: Jacques will step off the stage. So please feel free to come up and shake his
hand or get a photo taken with him or ask a question. He'll do that. Then when Jacques is
finished, our photographer Joel is going to step up on the stage. And I'm going to ask you all
to rise because Joel is going to take a photo of Jacques with you as the backdrop. It really is
terrific.

I'm going to stop now and turn it over to Jacques.
>> Jacques Fein: First of all, | want to thank a few people. Not necessarily in this order, but
Mr. Louis for supporting this program, which is very, very good for the Museum, for the Jewish

community, my partner -- not only with me but with many other survivors, really fantastic. And
the Museum staff is always fantastic. My friends who came from New York and Elkridge and
Judee, | thank them and all of you for coming here. | hope you learned something different
than the usual Holocaust history. That's what we do. A lot of us survivors -- it's our only time
to speak. In 10, 15 years we're not going to be here anymore. We have no problem speaking.
Remember, it's 70 years after the end of World War II. So emotionally speaking, there's
obviously emotions but it's not like we came off the boat. So -- it's very important for us to
speak and answer questions.

What | like about volunteering is it's like a learning experience from the people who
ask me different questions. I'm sure there are people from all over the United States and other
countries. It's really great doing this.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Jacques.
