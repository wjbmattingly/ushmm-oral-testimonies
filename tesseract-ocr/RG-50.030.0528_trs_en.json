My family and I disembarked in France, the other passengers were admitted in Belgium, Holland and England. My father was interned in Gurs and in late \u201942 transported from Drancy to Auschwitz. He was never heard from again. My mother and I lived in Nice until September of 1942. French collaborators arrested thousands of Jews and we found a hiding place in an attic and stayed there a few months until my mother arranged for false identification papers and a guide to take us to the Swiss border. We walked over pastures at night and entered at Switzerland illegally. We were not sent back. We were taken to a football field near Geneva, having crossed the border at Annemasse. And after several days were sent to a Aufangslager reception camp at Ayresfield, Berner Oberland. The camp was primitive, or rustic, as you would expect in basic training. The food adequate and the Swiss soldiers friendly and sympathetic with our plight.\u201d\u2019 And then it goes on to tell the rest of the Story."

He knew intimately Rabbi Don Attagori, the famous author. And if you went up to the dormitories along the stair what -- what do you call it, the stairs, you had pictures from Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Maxim Gorky. And it was all about the classics. And on Saturday they -- they would have what they called andoch, a certain evening of spiritual - spiritual -- spirituality or something. And they would play Beethoven\u2019s Fifth, or Eine kleine Nachtmusik, Mozart, Beethoven, Hayden, Bach, Brahms and Handel and so forth and so on. And my entire th -- wa -- culture was written with a capital C. And I went to this school along with a lot of other children who were refugees in Switzerland during that time, and among the student body were two brothers and that\u2019s a very interesting item. There were two brothers, the nephews of the chief of staff of the German -- German army, whose name was Walter von Brauchitsch. And their name was Hans and Matteas von Brauchitsch. And we were very close, we were friends. And in the issue of \u201cLife\u201d magazine of May 1946 there\u2019s a caption where German general\u2019s nephews went to school with Jewish -- the Jewish immigrants. And there\u2019s one picture of me and -- and the Brauchitsch brothers. And we have kept in touch all throughout my stay here in the United States. And I went to that school for about a little more than a year. And in47 I came to America. Immigrated legally. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And the Empire -- and then it became a matter of -- strictly of economics. The Empire room had 500 seats and the cover charge, meaning the -- meaning the cost of simply getting a table to sit down, it did not even cover a drink or anything to eat, that way the cover charge was a so-called entry ticket, if you will. And the cover charge went from five dollars to 15 dollars per person. And then it went to 25 dollars. At the same time the salaries from 7,000 dollars went to 35,000 dollars. So high that at one point it got to -- it became a reality that Barbra Streisand got one million dollars to appear in the room for one week. And it was logical that the hotel could not sustain, even though the -- the nightclub was not designed to make money, it was mainly designed to attract conventions and people to fill the rooms. That was the idea, to fill the rooms. But those salaries were unsupportable, so the only place that you could have that kind of entertainment would end up to be Las Vegas, where the profit and the money came from the gambling tables. And in 1975, the Empire room closed. It -- it -- and 1t became just a banquet facility, and the nightclub as such, as it was known, no longer existed. And -- and the only place that you could have the kind of entertainment would be in a facility where three or four thousand people would cor -- would congregate, would sit.

And they were not used to -- and the -- they were not used to those prices. And so when I said that I -- first hand experience, I -- I came to manage the Venetian Room, which was the nightclub in the Fairmont Hotel. And Tony Bennett appeared there and -- and well, and a number of other entertainers. And when the phone rang for someone to make reservations, they would say, well how much does it cost to get in? So I would say, well the cover charge is 15 dollars. And the response on the other end would be, and what do you get for that? And without trying to - without -- trying to avoid to sound sarcastic, I would say well, you get a table, and you get to sit down. But how else -- what else would you say? Th-That was the logical answer. And consequently the entertainment of that -- that caliber of entertainment again went the way they did it in New York. And so Richard Swig, who was owner of the hotel decided that Atlanta -- the only thing that would work in Atlanta would be western entertainment. And so they brought in Loretta Lynn and a couple of other -- and Alison Krauss, some people with a [indecipherable] with a reputation in the area of western music. And so you had a lot of -- I don\u2019t want to use the term -- I -- I think that to say rednecks, you know, would probably not take -- take too well, so let\u2019s say country folk, or whatever you will. But they -- the western music in -- in that -- that kind of caliber of western music didn\u2019t do it either.

The -- the- I worked -- for example, I -- the s -- New York Culinary Federation sent me to the Greenbrier at White Sulphur Springs. And the Greenbrier is a -- an institution. It is a hotel that, like the Homestead in Virginia, it is a hotel that was the home to senators and presidents and -- and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and what have you. It was the elite, the so-called 500 and chief executive officers of the major American corporations, they all spent their summers in the Greenbrier with Ben Hogan and -- and the top golfers, the golf tournaments. Anybody who was anybody went to the Greenbrier. But the Greenbrier was owned by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway company, by a fellow whose name was Young. His last name was Young, the first name I do not recall, and the hotel was notably restricted. It did not have Jewish employees and it did not have Jewish clientele, simple as that. Clear and simple. And I already had been there and in the office they categorically told me that -- an office girl, a very nice girl told me that the -- if I were smart I would change my name because with a name like Goldstein you wouldn\u2019t last in this hotel.

But Pan American had an ad in the paper, wanted, young man between 31 and 35 as flight attendant, capable of talking two languages. Well, I said to myself, I speak French, I speak German. I\u2019m ideal -- a -- an ideal candidate as flight attendant. I submitted my resum\u00e9 and at -- was called to a meeting in -- with the executive flight board. And 10 days later I got a letter, dear Mr. Goldstein -- I was so shocked that I still remember the wording of the letter, dear Mr. Goldstein. As we told you upon your interview, your qualifications are not best suited for our specialized requirements and this however is in no way to indicate your scope of ability and wishing you every success for the future, we remain cordially yours, W.J. Parrot, superintendent of flight service. Now, it happened that in nine - that was in 1956, and it happened that wa -- Israel was at war with the -- with the Arabs, and Lebanon -- and I was supposed to fly Beirut, Rome, Paris, London, Beirut.
