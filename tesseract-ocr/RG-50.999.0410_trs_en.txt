Welcome to United States Holocaust Memorial

First Person with Halina Peabody
Wednesday, March 27, 2013............

>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon, and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bill Benson, | am the host of the museum's public
program, First Person. We just began our 14th year of First Person last week. Our First Person
today is Mrs. Halina Peabody, whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis Franklin
Smith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring First Person.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with
us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each guest serves as a
volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue until mid August. The museum's website,
at www.ushmm.org, provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.

Halina Peabody will share with us her First Person account of her experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 40 minutes. If time allows towards the end of our program,
we'll have an opportunity for you to ask her a few questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear
from Halina is one individual's account of the Holocaust.

We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with her introduction.

Halina Litman was born in Krakow, Poland, December 12, 1932. Poland is to the right of
Germany on this map of Europe. The arrow on this map of Poland shows the location of Krakow.

Halina was the daughter of Ignacy and Olga Litman.

In this photograph, we see Halina, with her mother and her Aunt Irka taken in 1938.

Halina, her mother and sister survived the war in Jaroslav under false papers identifying the
family as Catholics. On the way to Jaroslav, the family encounted a Polish man, who threatened to
reveal their identity. Halina's mother struck a bargain with this man of using their tickets for the
luggage, all the money she had and coats they were wearing, in trade for their survival.

Here we see Halina, her mother and her baby sister Eva.

This is the house where Halina and her family stayed in Jaroslav. In this photograph, Halina
and her sister Eva celebrate Christmas in hiding.

Halina's mother decided the safest place to hide was in plain sight. She found a job ata
German headquarters peeling potatoes for German troops. This is a photograph of Halina's mother
with two Polish coworkers at the German headquarters where Olga worked. After the war, Halina
and her family immigrated to England. Halina lives in Bethesda, Maryland. Her husband, Richard,
passed away in 2011. She has two sons, one who lives in England, and the other just 10 minutes
away. Halina has two granddaughters, Hannah, who is 16, and Olivia, 9. Hannah, who is producing
a film about her grandmother for a school project is here today. If you don't mind, a little hand wave.
Thank you.

Hannah frequently travels to England to see her son and her sister and her family. In April
2011, Halina and some of the other survivors from her hometown of Zaleszczyki in Poland, which is
now in the Ukraine, went there to place a monument on an unmarked grave in which 800 Jews were
buried during the first German action in that town. We will hear more about that a little later.

She continues her keen interest in sports, which have been a particular importance in her life,
because her mother was the Polish swimming champion in 1925. Later this year, Halina will travel to
Poland to visit an exhibit of Jewish athletes in Krakow. The exhibit includes her mother. She will
also visit her family in England and Israel. Halina speaks frequently about her experience during the
Holocaust at schools and here at the museum, as well as in other settings. Next week, she travels
to Racine, Wisconsin, where she will speak at a community Holocaust Days of Remembrance
sponsored by the Racine Public Library. Last month, she spoke at a high school as part of a
Holocaust education program of Montgomery College in Maryland. Other upcoming talks include a
school in Maclean, Virginia, and a home for the elderly in Maryland.

She will also participate in next month's Holocaust commemoration at Har Shalom Synagogue
in Potomac, Maryland, where she will light one of six candles accompanied by her family. With that,
| would like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mrs. Halina Peabody.

[Applause]

Welcome, Halina, and thank you so much for being willing to be with us today and be our First

Person. We have so much to cover in such a short period, we should begin right away, | think.
>> Halina Peabody: Absolutely.

>> Bill Benson: You told me "Your life was beautiful" in the early years

before war broke out in Poland in 1939. Let's start our conversation with you
telling us a bit about your community, your family and yourself and those
years before the war actually began.

>> Halina Peabody: | was very young, not quite 7 when the war broke out.
My memory is rather childhood. | was the first child of my parents. | was the
princess, so to speak. | had every bicycle and tricycle, and my mother was
very all-around sports woman. | was skating freely at 5. | remember that.
She was always teaching the girls there, the little children there to swim. We
had a nice house. My father was a dentist. He had his surgery in the front of
the house, and my mother tended to me and the little garden.

We had beautiful weather there. Zaleszczyki is in the easternmost
part of Poland. Not anymore, but it used to be, and the river Dniester which
is near Romania. You could go in a kayak, halfway through, but there were
buoys there, and you couldn't go any further. But you could get a day pass to
Romania and go over. It was very close, the relations were good. It was a
very friendly frontier.

| had no worries. My father insisted on teaching me to read before |
was going to school, because | was supposed to be a genius.

[Laughter]
But it stood me in good stead later on.
>> Bill Benson: Besides teaching you to read at 5, your parents taught you
many other skills.
>> Halina Peabody: My mother was a wonderful knitter. She taught me to
knit, crochet, embroider. She used to knit for my Shirley Temple doll.

>> Bill Benson: Tell us a bit more about your mother's athletic experience.
>> Halina Peabody: Well, my mother was a natural. When she started
swimming, she immediately passed everybody else, even though she wasn't
even swimming well. She very quickly became part of the team. Very early
on, in her early teenage years she won the Polish championship. She broke
records. She used to show me the statuette of gold she had for the
championship, the four-leaf clover that we had, all gone, but she was
wonderful. When she left Zaleszczyki, even though we were from Krakow,
because there was water there, she could water ski there, and we'd go on the
kayak. | had a little paddle, just for me. A wonderful, wonderful life up to that
point, up to 1939.
>> Bill Benson: Of course, it all would change then. September 1939
Germany invaded Poland from the west. The Soviets then invaded Poland
from the east. You lived in the part of Poland that fell under the Russian
occupation.
>> Halina Peabody: Yes. What happened was, we knew the Russians were
coming. What | -- | don't remember exactly what | knew, but the people were
very great panic, they were running around. A lot of men decided they didn't
want to be conscripted. That's what the Russians did, they used to conscript
the men into the Russian army, and you were 20 years in this kind of prison.
You couldn't leave.

So a lot of men -- also they thought about World War | where they did
that to the men. They didn't think of women and children being in any
danger. | didn't mention that my sister was born two months before the war.
So there was a baby in the house.

My father decided he should run over to Romania with some others,
and they just went over the bridge to Romania. A lot of people with him did.

Unfortunately, then, the Russians came in, and they did a lot of bad
things, as | understand it. The people, however, that went over decided after
a while that things have settled down, and perhaps it would be OK to come
back to the families and the businesses that they left.

So they decided to quietly cross back over. By then, the river was
completely frozen over. Took a white sheet, they tried to cross quietly back.
Unfortunately, the Russians by then sealed the border. They were all
arrested.

They were tried for being spies, because they went over and came
back. My father ended up in a prison, then was sent to Siberia, to a place --
we as the family of a criminal, quote unquote, were supposed to go to
Russia. As | said, the criminals and families were also sent to Siberia. For
some reason, that | still don't know what it was, they didn't take us. We were
all ready to go. However, they threw us out of our house, because we were
not allowed to have a house.

| Know we moved to a little place called time-out, with a town -- called
Touste up the road. We had to leave. We had a little room, | remember.
That picture is the only picture of my sister as a little child, that my mother
was there. That was in the winter. That's where we were, until very shortly
afterwards, the Germans decided that --
>> Bill Benson: Let me ask you a couple questions before we go there.
When your father was then sent to Siberia, arrested and sent to Siberia, did
your mother know what had happened to him? Did she hear from him in any
way?
>> Halina Peabody: We didn't hear for quite a while. He was completely
incommunicado for a while. Then we got a letter that he was in the gulag
there. Before the Germans took over, we had a few letters back and forth.
>> Bill Benson: Once the Germans took over, that was the end of that?
>> Halina Peabody: The communication was over.
>> Bill Benson: Were any other relatives sent to Siberia?
>> Halina Peabody: Yes, my aunt, uncle and cousin. The other aunt and
uncle, who were supposed to be taken as well, they for some reason left and
they ended up in Auschwitz.
>> Bill Benson: They weren't taken by the Russians?
>> Halina Peabody: They were not, later on.

>> Bill Benson: You were about 8 1/2 when the Nazis turned on the
Russians, and the Germans came into the area of Poland where you were.
>> Halina Peabody: And we came back to our house then.
>> Bill Benson: Of course, then things turned dramatically worse. Tell us
what happened.
>> Halina Peabody: Well, when the Germans came, we came back to our
house, when the Germans occupied the rest of Poland they put all kinds of
rules. Everybody was very anxious to cooperate. We were very, very
terrified. This was another occupation, not knowing what they expected from
us. As the Russians did, they demanded gold, silver, anything of value we
had to give in.

They had everybody working for them. Every Jewish person had to be
working for them, to the point where if there was no particular job for them,
they made them clean the roads.

A lot of times they would take groups of young people to work in the
field. They would just ask for the number of so-and-so, they would take them
and come back.

They created -- excuse me. They created Judenrat. Judenrat was a
Jewish committee. They took the leaders of the Jewish community of the
town and they worked through them. So if they had demands for whatever
they had demands, they would ask through the committee, and the

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,
committee was told to supply whatever was necessary.

As | said, we went back to our house, so my mother tried to look after
my sister as best she could, and me. Kept my writing up. Then they knew
she was a good knitter, so they had her knit for the mayor of town. Of
course, a German man who had lots of children. Her job was to knit for the
mayor's children.

Everybody, as | said, was very cooperative. They, of course, put
yellow stars on the houses, yellow bands on our hands. No school for
Jewish children. As | said, we just sat there and tried to do whatever we
could. Very, very scared, not knowing, not knowing what. There was
nowhere to run. We just waited to see what would happen next. We hoped
just by cooperating things wouldn't be too bad. Everybody was willing to do
what was necessary.

We waited always for the people, went to work, came back. Then the
SS came in, all in black uniforms and gold buttons, very, very scary, came
roaring down the road on bicycles --
>> Bill Benson: Motorcycles?
>> Halina Peabody: Motorcycles, yes. Great noise. We just stayed quiet,
didn't know what else was coming.

What they did was instill a lot of fear in us. We were absolutely
terrified. They start doing things like catching Jewish people that had beards,

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
NOT VERBATIM RECORD

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
and that was their religions part of their -- religious part, the religious people
had lots of beards. They would catch a person in the street. There were lots
of screams, yells. They would tear off their hair and do things like that. |
remember one time | was standing in front of my house, and my mother
pulled me away. Those are the kind of images that | remembered.
>> Bill Benson: You shared with me an incident that took place pretty quickly
where a large group of young men and women were rounded up. Tell us
about that.
>> Halina Peabody: Yeah. Well, at this point they had this demand for a big
group of young people. They said they wanted as many as they could to
come to the square where they would gather, and they would walk up the
road. There was an old Polish military camp. The winters were very, very
fierce there. Very, very severe. Sometimes for the winter they would wrap
up the trunks of the trees with burlap. That's what they said that they needed
to have done, because they were up there in the military camp and there was
nobody there, but they needed to wrap those trees.

So a lot of people came, over the number apparently even requested.
Everybody wanted to help. A lot of volunteers. They all came.

They were marched up the road, and we waited for them to come
back in the evening. And nobody was coming back. So people were getting
a little nervous. Waited and waited. Family members, nothing.

Eventually, towards the evening, one man dragged himself in and
back to his family, and he told us what happened. What he said was that
when they got there, there was a grave, a communal grave. There were
planks of wood over the grave, and they were told to take off the clothes and
lay down on the planks, and they were shot. As they were shot, they
dropped into the grave.

He was the last one to be done. He was one of the last group that
was shot, and he -- apparently they missed his heart, they just hit his arm,
and they didn't cover them very much with the earth, because there was no
need to. A little bit over the top. He managed to drag himself out, and he
came home, and that's what he reported.

We then understood what happened. Over 800 people. As |
mentioned to Bill, we always were aware of this horrific memory, that |
thought there was not a sign of but this grave. We were back in Zaleszczyki,
and they didn't know about it even.

Through the museums, | tracked down a few people from this
hometown of mine. As | said, | didn't remember any names, but | saw two
sisters from Zaleszczyki, and | managed to track them down. There was
quite -- it was about five, six of us apparently in New York, in Montreal.

We got together. We got a monument. This lady who lives in
Montreal went back there and she arranged with the town to put the

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
monument on it. We traveled April 2011 and put a monument. We had a
cantor there, and we prayed, prayed for them. That was one of my goals that
| wanted to put some kind of a memory mark there. So that was the first time
we heard about this, what happened to people when they took them away.

Then we settled back, we wanted to know what the next thing is going
to be, the next shoe to drop. Not very soon afterwards, they again -- this time
the demand was for a number of people. They had exact numbers. Because
they were going to take them for work in Germany.

Of course, by then, everybody was running and trying to hide. My
mother took my sister and me over, | know, to a lady that used to cook for us,
across the street, and we were going to stay with her for the day. And we
waited there all day.

They had an easy job, because all of the houses were marked with
yellow stars, they knew where to find them. They got the right number. They
loaded them on the train, supposedly for work in Germany. Never heard
from them again, either.

As we went back, we realized that it was really a situation that was
horrendous. My mother with the two children, nowhere to run.

We wanted to know what is going to be next. What they did next, they
didn't want to have the trouble to look for people and to drag them out of the
houses, because after they had those two actions, there were not that many

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,
Jews left. So they threw us out of the town altogether to the same place that
we were during the Russians, Touste. They also brought people from the
communities around that did the same thing. Whatever was left, they put us
together again into Touste.

There, everybody first, what they wanted to do was look for hiding
places, because we knew the next step would be, again, they were going to
try to get us out.

So | know my mother said to me there's not much point in doing that,
because as soon as they get us into a smaller group, they'll move us again.
So we will lose. This is a no-win situation.

She was trying desperately to have at least the children taken over to
Romania, all sorts of things, but nothing worked.
>> Bill Benson: She put in motion a plan at one point --
>> Halina Peabody: Not at this point. She tried to get us over --
>> Bill Benson: That's what | mean. Apart from her?
>> Halina Peabody: That's right, without her. Yes. | didn't want to go.
Anyway, at this point the man came again for a group of people to be in the
square to go for work in Germany, and at this point you see my mother,
because she had some connections there, she knew two farmers. She
decided to hide with the farmers.

A lot of people went underneath the houses. A lot of people had little

hiding places marked for them. So everybody went into hiding.

| was placed with a farmer up in the loft. | was left there. My mother
made a deal with another farmer and took my sister. She was going to stay
with that farmer for the day. As the day went on, the lady that had me kept
coming back and telling me that this one was seen in the square, that one
was seen in the square. | was convinced my mother was caught. All day
long | thought my God, my mother was caught.

Toward the end of the day finally, she came with my sister and told me
what happened with her, which was that her farmer was scared. In the
middle of the day she got scared, because it was a high penalty for keeping
Jewish people. And she threw her out. She just threw her out with my sister
into an empty field.

Now, that empty field was flat, and it had just a little bush there, she
told me. She was hiding under this little bush with my sister. She was
crouching there for the rest of the day. She said how they didn't see her is a
miracle, because they were circling with airplanes, looking for stragglers.
Somehow, by miracle, they didn't see her.

She was always worried about me. Now, she was worried also that |
was caught. So we were both in a state of great anxiety.

When we came together, she said she made up her mind that we
were not going to separate again. Whatever happens to us, we'll go

together. That's the way it was going to be, whatever happens we'll be
together, we're not going to be apart.

She was worried mainly for the children. | Knew she didn't care about
herself, because she knew what was happening in the concentration camps,
that the children didn't survive at all.

So she, with the help of her friend, started thinking again of finding a
way. What they came up with, because we were three girls, she managed to
obtain false identities of Catholics. We were going to just leave there,
escape from there into a town where nobody knew us.

That's what the friends helped her, we managed to get onto a train in
Jaroslav -- I'm sorry, in Touste. This was going to be a trip to a place called
Jaroslav. | had no idea why that town, but it was on the way to Krakow. The
town was already without any Jews there. We just hoped nobody would
recognize us, you know. | was blonde, real blonde, and | had green eyes, so
| didn't look Jewish.

We didn't speak Yiddish. Our accents were very Polish. My mother
thought we had maybe a chance.

So we said good-bye to our friends, none of whom survived,
unfortunately. We boarded the train and started our trip. This was going to
be four days and four-night trip. In olden days it took a long time. It was
wartime. We knew we had to change in places. Anyway, the friends

collected little money for her. We had two suitcases left of all, everything that
we ever had. That's how we started our trip to Jaroslav.

As we were traveling, a young man attached himself to us, started
chatting us up, talking about the children and my mother. Slowly, slowly he
started pushing, asking if there was anybody Jewish in the family, maybe the
father, grandfather. It was enough if it was great-great-great grandfather was
Jewish, you were still Jewish. Didn't have much chance.

Slowly, slowly he wore my mother down, and you can imagine a
mother with two kids, terrified, not knowing where we're going, what to do.

She said to me finally, you know, | could not resist anymore. | couldn't
withstand the pressure, and | told him, yes, indeed, we are Jewish. At which
point, he said, well, you know, | have to take you to the gestapo. And I'm
going to Jaroslav as well, so | will look after you.

He did, he looked after us very carefully. He was very sure to have
even my sister or me in his sights. But we had nowhere to run. We weren't
going to run anyway.

As we were traveling, then my mother started again thinking of
something. She didn't know what, but she wanted to do something. She
knew we didn't have any way to escape.

The main thing with her was not to be separated from the children.
She did not want the children to be taken away from her.

So she started speaking with him, and she said, "Look, | will give you
the receipts for my two suitcases and all the money | have." Even she
promised the coats we had on our backs. She said "| just want you to do one
thing for me. When we get to the gestapo, could you have us shot
immediately, all three of us, because | don't want to be separated from my
children, | don't want the children to suffer."

He promised he would. So that's how we traveled, four days, four
nights. We were absolutely exhausted as you can imagine. Whilst we were
traveling, | wasn't thinking hard, but we neared Jaroslav and | started
worrying a little bit. | was afraid of dying, as anybody would, even a small
child would.

My sister was completely unaware of all this. She was very young,
like 2 years old, 2 1/2. We didn't tell her anything. For me, it started being a
big deal. | got scared and didn't want to die.

As we got off the train, we started walking towards gestapo, and |
started pulling at my mother saying "Mom, mom, | don't want to die." My
poor mom looked at him and said "Look, why don't you let her go? She's
blonde and she could probably get away with it, maybe she will survive."

| said "No, | don't want to go by myself. | want you and my sister to
come too" obviously.

So as we're walking, she says to him, "Do you have children of your

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
own?"
He said "Yes."

She said "Look, I've given you everything | have. Why do you want us
on your conscience? Just let us go and try our luck."

And something touched him, and he thought about it, and he said
"You don't have a chance," he said, but he left us.

So he left us in the middle of the town, strange town, didn't know, the
main road, left us. There we were. We had nothing. He took everything with
him, of course. We were just three of us.
>> Bill Benson: You have nothing but your, at least now still alive --
>> Halina Peabody: We have our lives. Yes, yes.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us, Halina, before you tell us how you started your new
life in Jaroslav, you are just 8 1/2, 9 years old, and you are now having to be
somebody that you're not, with a whole new identity, new religion. What do
you recall of the difficulty of that, of being so prepared that you wouldn't get
tripped up by somebody like another person like this man asking probing
questions to figure out who you really are?
>> Halina Peabody: Well, | didn't know much, but | was a kid. | knew | had
to cross myself going in the church, with the right hand, and coming out. At
that age, didn't know much more.
>> Bill Benson: You had to have a different name?

>> Halina Peabody: Oh, yes. That was the first thing, my mother sat me
down, gave me all of the new details. A new name, new birth date, new
grandparents, different area, everything, yes. | knew, | was aware. Fear will
keep you straight. | was pretty well-trained by my mother anyway.

| had all of the details, and the trouble was with the papers that we
never knew whether they were good or not. My mother was always worried
about that. To this day, | don't know, because | gave them to the Holocaust
Museum. | don't know if the papers were real or not. They were sold to us
by a priest, that's all | Know. There were stamps. Those days there were no
computers. Thank goodness now. It was better not to be checked. That
was one of my mother's problems, because when we were left in the town,
she needed to find a place to stay so we wouldn't be on the street, because
the Germans were just walking around with the gun at the side, it was very
easy. Life was very cheap.

We walked into a little cafe where my mother started asking if they
knew of somebody who could take lodgers in. A young man got up, said he
knew of a washer lady. He said he would walk us to her, which he did. The
lady saw mother and two children, of course in a terrible, exhausted
condition. She said she'll take us in.

Her sons were very much against it, but she said -- she was a real
Christian, | say always. A mother and two children, she said | have to help.

What we got was a bed. That's all we needed. My mother told her we have
no money, but that next day she would go to find a job, and she would --
whatever she earns she would bring, and for Keeping us. That's exactly what
she did.

She did the housekeeping job. You had to steal a little food here and
there. That was the way during the war. She did change this job a couple of
times.

My sister was very sickly. She was very worried about my sister
because she really was sick. She was also worried about my sister's hair,
because my sister's hair is completely like an afro, very, very curly. In
Poland, the Polish girls have straight, blonde hair. Mine was wavy, so it
wasn't so bad, but she was really an afro.

What she did, under the pretext she needs to make them thicker, she
shaved her head a couple of times because she was so worried.

There was school for Polish kids for one -- for two hours a day. One
hour for religion, one hour for the other things. That's where it helped me,
because | learned the catechism from A to Z very quickly, because | could
read. That was the way they taught religion at the time. | think it's changed
now.

We went to church on Sundays, which was lovely. Mass was said in
Latin. It was a kind of nice place to be, and it was warm, the incense was

somehow partly German, so he had the right to have a laborer for free, so |
was sent to help him in the kitchen. So my mother always thought it was
good to be working.

The Germans, all they wanted to know is that everybody was working
for them. That was the main thing.

During that time, we had one letter from our friends, who before they
perished. And that letter was through the Red Cross, that came to us, which
they forwarded, which told us that my father was safe with his sister in
Palestine.

Now, we knew there was a part of the family that immigrated to
Palestine, now Israel, in the 1930s, 1932, | think. And that was my father's
sister with her four children. But we never met them. We didn't even know
which town. But the fact that he was out of Russia, which was so important,
because he was a prisoner for 20 years hard labor, so the fact that he was
out gave us some hope and something to hang on to during this terrible time.

We had very little information what was going on in the front, anything
like that. No radios, no papers.

>> Bill Benson: This woman that you described was kindly, who took you
into her home, you had a place to stay. She had some sons that were a
different story.
>> Halina Peabody: Correct, yes. One of her sons, the youngest one, did
something that was a death penalty as well. He killed pigs for a living.
>> Bill Benson: Clandestinely?
>> Halina Peabody: Of course. The Poles were not allowed to have meat
either. We were always afraid they'd come around and look for him. They
were always looking for him, never found him. She had four sons.
>> Bill Benson: The Germans came by?
>> Halina Peabody: Yes, later. We had something else in common. In the
meantime, my mother was always trying to think of a surer way, better way.
As | said, she decided that maybe it would be good to hide in plain sight. If
she could work for a German military camp up the road, she would have an
idea like that. If she was stopped in the street, if she showed them the ID
working for the Germans, they would let you go. Otherwise, they might
inquire papers, this, that, or the other. This way, she felt, would be a little
safer, because she was forever thinking of security. She was worried my
sister was playing in the street with curly hair, everything was scary.

So she applied to the German military camp for work. Then she told
her they have to check the papers, so again we lived in fear for weeks. |

don't know if they ever checked it. Who knows? That far back.

Anyway, after about eight weeks, she got the permit and started
working as you saw. She was working in the kitchen peeling potatoes with
some other people. That was her job. She had the Ausweiss, she had the
ID. At that point, it became very important, because one night the Germans
decided to look for the son again, and came great noise and screams. They
usually came like that in the middle of the night.

Open the door, they came in, they checked, and they took everybody
in, and they said they were looking for him. Of course, he wasn't there. They
were going to take everybody into the station to check them out. But then my
mother got up and showed the ID. He said "No, you stay."

So the only Jews in the place stayed.

[Laughter]
The others were just checked out and brought, came back the next day,
because they were all employed, working one way or the other. That was the
kind of thing that you had to always be watchful.
>> Bill Benson: Your mother, when you described her, what she did, the
courage that that took, to not only have a hidden identity, but to go right into
the den of the enemy, right into their camp and work. Must have been just
terrifying.

this dog has been trained to smell out Jews. She said look, | know this is
impossible, but what if this dog takes fancy to me?

>> Halina Peabody: Yeah. Well, one morning we woke up, since we were
on the main road there was the clapping of horses and carts. We kids used
to go and steal food from them sometimes. They were always going back
and forth, but at this point, this morning, it was completely quiet. It was a
deathly silence. We didn't know what was happening.

work, she didn't know. | was standing by the window, by the bed. She was
in bed with my sister. Suddenly, there was a tremendous bang, and a bomb
fell on us.

| started screaming "My hand! My hand!"

My mother got up, grabbed me. The kitchen was down, | mean, the roof fell
down. My mother grabbed me by the other hand, we walked into the street.
The hospital was about a block and a half away. She carried my sister, so
she couldn't carry me. But my hand was bleeding badly.

We managed to get to the hospital. She -- they picked me up there,
and they cleaned me up. They told my mother that my hand is very dirty,
there was no penicillin. They were going to have to probably amputate.

My mother was -- | can't even -- well, any mother, any parent can

stayed the night with my sister. The next morning she went back to the
place. It was unlivable already. A neighbor took her in. Apparently, the lady,

the roof falling down, so she passed away. And my mother was taken by the
neighbor.

In the meantime, the nurses there were nuns, very lovely ladies,
always in white, very beautiful ladies, little blonde hair coming out |
remember. They took care of me. She saved my hand -- they saved my
hand. They simply had to do a lot of burning out the stuff, because it was all
open wound. So they had to cauterize it a lot.
>> Bill Benson: You mentioned no penicillin for infection, nor pain
medications.
>> Halina Peabody: Right. Well, the pain was the cauterizing.
>> Bill Benson: Right.
>> Halina Peabody: The nun would tell me to scream. She would say "Put
your hand in my habit and scream." My poor mother used to run for miles
just not to hear it.
>> Bill Benson: The day that that happened, essentially, was the end of the
war for that part of Poland. It was over, you were injured on that last day?
>> Halina Peabody: Well, yes, that's right. The Russians came in. My
mother said they were going to stay, too. She knew.

did.

In the meantime, | think the stress on my mother was so great that she was diagnosed with
breast cancer, and the doctor urged us to have the operation, because he didn't want us to be
orphans. My mother had to go through that. In the meantime, she was writing to wherever she could,
and luckily for us the radio station in Tel Aviv recognized the names. There was a lady there, so we
got in touch with my father.

My father sent a cousin of mine, who was in the British army, and he came to put us in touch
with the Jewish agency. We had to move closer to Krakow. Again, we had to keep our pretense,
because we were asked if we wanted lodging. "Are you really Polish?"

Meaning are you Jewish? We had to keep the pretense up, until we got into the main kind of group of
people being taken over to Germany.

What they did, they put you in a sort of communal home, then you were taken by lories, trucks
they're called here, took you about a kilometer or two past the frontier between Poland and Germany,
and you took a train to Berlin.

We missed my father twice, but finally we did make contact.

irony --
>> Halina Peabody: Oh, yes.
>> Bill Benson: You know where I'm going.
>> Halina Peabody: Whilst in this communal home at one point, they
accused us of trying to pretend to be Jewish because we wanted to get out of
Poland.

[Laughter]

>> Bill Benson: It was hard to prove that was the case?

>> Halina Peabody: My mother said my husband's name was Isaac. People
signed up for it. That was real irony, yes. That was, yes.

So we managed -- the frontier was a Polish guard, and a Russian
guard, because there was some agreement that the Jews can be sort of
taken out of Poland, if they wanted to.

So they had some problems, they had to take some extra watches to
get through. Then at the German station, they refused to sell us tickets
because we were Jews. That was already after they lost the war. But
eventually, we managed to get to Berlin, and | got white bread and cheese.

Slowly, slowly we ended up in Italy for a couple of months, where my
father caught up with us. We then had the choice, because my father when

Now, for my wounded hand they did give me sort of like Social
