My father was Hungarian, my mother German, and they went to Vienna, it\u2019s no secret really, because my father\u2019s family would not have my mother, who was a very pretty young actress, much younger than my father, but extremely pretty, well they would not have her in Hungary, not at -- at his place. So he had to give all this up, and he did, he gave it all up for her and bought a flat in Vienna, and came to live in Vienna, which 1s -- [ -- it must have been -- I didn\u2019t know him, you know, he died when I was two, so I never knew him, but I gather he was a charming man, I bet he was. But he was 30 years older than she. So it -- one can imagine, can\u2019t one?"

            "answer": "Well, ideas, my mother didn\u2019t have ideas, she was an actress, and she was very beautiful, and she was you know, surrounded by elegant and charming men, which was rather nice, you know, I rather enjoyed that. But she was very childlike. And she -- she certainly liked la grande vie, and she created this grande vie, which was, I think, brave of her. She continued to have it after my father died, when there was some money, but not much. And when it was gone she was particularly brave because she spoke absolutely perfect English, and she took to translating plays, which was -- course was a very, very good thing at the time in Vienna because they had no plays of their own in the 20\u2019s. Later, Thomas Bennett came, but there were no Austrian playwrights. Well, of course there were the -- Schnitzler and old ones, you know, but not modern ones. So all the plays came from France and England, and America, too, but England was the - and she did rather well, and she worked extremely hard. This I respected, I mean I -- I -- you know, I -- I think that I learned a lot from that, because I -- I -- I didn\u2019t respect her for her childishness. I --I did think that, you know, by the time I was 10, I felt that really she should be more grown up. But -- but I did respect her staying up late, late, late into the night working so that she could get -- offer us this life, which she thought was essential. Of course, I would never have thought it was essential. But she did."

She had a lot of clothes, and she would go to all the sales, sometimes dragging me along, and buy these abso -- the remnants, you know, of beautiful, beautiful materials. And this little seamstress, who was absolutely splendid, and was able to copy models. So anyway, all this, this was the sort of child life, until I was 11, and then by this time I had changed schools, had gone from, you know, my elementary school, which was a very ordinary state school, which I loved. I loved school anyway. I had gone to a rryah gimnasium, which is sort of -- you know, a private high school for girls, called Lueetlan. And -- and at 11 I was sent to England. My brother -- I had a brother who was four years older than I, Guido. Guido had already been sent to England years before, also at -- no he -- he ma -- he was sent at 12 actually, because my father wanted us brought up in England, which was a very wise idea, I think. I mean, he also wanted us brought up in France, which also happened, so you know -- not my brother, but I. So I -- I was able to speak these languages, you know, which is good. And then I came back to Vienna to go to dramatic school."

And the train, they couldn\u2019t find --- well, I gath -- I gather they couldn\u2019t find a train to replace it, so they had to repair it, which was going to take five hours. And so the -- there was another child on this train by itself, so we were unaccompanied children.

And we were taken to the -- there was a children\u2019s sort of gallendare if you -- 1f you know what that means. I mean, it was just a -- you know, rows and rows of -- of -- of benches going up, all children, it was only children. And so we were taken way up, because there was -- there wasn\u2019t any space, as you can imagine. But they put us in there, and I just thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. It was absolutely magnificent. And you know, all the -- the -- the -- this wonderful rhythm and these -- these - these clean looking boys and -- and girls -- I mean and also marching, you know, people. And then of course there were these speeches, and I had absolutely no idea what they were saying. I mean, I didn\u2019t understand a word. But I screamed like everybody else. I mean, I thought it was just so exciting. I had never been so excited in my life, I think. The colors, and the -- I don\u2019t know, the -- the music, and the -- the rhythm, you know, there was just -- it was theater like you  one -- it\u2019s almost indescribable of course, you -- you\u2019ve seen it, everybody has seen it on film. But of course here I was actually seeing it, you know, and the colors are quite different when you are actually watching these -- these -- these flags wave, you know, in the wind. And you\u2019re there, and they\u2019re -- and you -- you get the wind, the -- that the s -- that the flags made, that they were all -- all around, they were everywhere, and there were thousands of flags.

So anyway then -- then there was the interesting thing, which I have written about, I came to -- came to school in England. I had this wonderful teacher whom I adored, Lee Hindly. She died fairly recently. Lee Chadwick afterwards. Well Lee Hindly, who I thought was a -- you know, fantastically grown up lady, becau -- I think she was, I mean -- and she was a very, very English, English girl -- young woman, with this wonderful voice, and this -- you know, this -- this absolutely beautiful -- not o -- Oxford English, but just the real sort of -- I-I can\u2019t describe it, I mean, I just thought it was divine, and of course she taught me every word I learned. I mean, I knew -- I didn\u2019t know a word of English when I came there. And she was very, very kind, and I adored her. Anyway, I arrived back to school and - and I wrote this -- we were supposed to write this, you know, this [indecipherable] this eg - essay about our most beautiful day of the holidays. Well, naturally I wrote about this. And -- and she read it, and -- and having read all the others, a prize was given for a girl who wrote -- little girl who wrote about a stallion having -- I mean, not a stallion, a -- a -- a horse having a baby, I me -- wonderful, wonderful story. And -- and she -- she said to me, that\u2019s a very good job of work, so that was enough for me. And then she said, \u201cCan you stay here a minute afterwards?\u201d After the lessons, so I did. And she said, \u201cI brought this for you, and I want you to read it.\u201d And she gave me this book, in English. And I said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d It said Mein Kampf in German underneath, and said, you know, my battle. And I said, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, the man you saw speak wrote this book about his plans for Europe, and I want you to read it.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d And she said, \u201cBecause anybody who comes from your corner of the world needs to read this book.\u201d She -- I later found out, I didn\u2019t know this, nobody knew this -- she was a member of the Communist party, and she became really very active indeed. In fact, you know later, much later, years later, she became a councilor for the Communist party in Oldeburough, in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "answer": "I was -- yes, I was 11. I mean, I was -- I was 11 and a half by then, because it was six months- I\u2019d been in this school for six months by then. And you know, I -- I did understand it. I mean, I would -- well, I would have said probably I read a third of it, you know, read here -- reading here and there, and there, and there, jumping, of course, which she knew I would. I mean it was impossible to read for -- for an 11 year old. But I -- I knew perfectly well that -- I saw perfectly well. I never understood how people told me afterwards they -- well, they couldn\u2019t read it to start out with, they hadn\u2019t read it, which was a lie. Everybody said they hadn\u2019t read it. All -- all ger - I don\u2019t think I -- well no, I did meet some Germans who admitted to having read it, but most Germans, including Speer, indeed, said they hadn\u2019t read it, that you know it was that Hitler wa - ca -- In Speer\u2019s case, Hitler told him it was -- it was way over, it was -- it was too late, not to bother. I mean, so many things had happened that it was -- we were holed, as they said. Anyway, so I brought it back to Lee, to Miss Hindly, and -- and she said, \u201cWell what did you think of it?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I da -- I -- two things. I mean, what I -- I mean, how is he go -- I mean, he wants to -- he wants Europe, he wants to rule over Europe, that seems quite clear.

Learn it, read, and maybe you'll find out.\u201d But of course I never did until, you know, until I did this work, which I did much later.

            "answer": "Well, I think actually I d -- I didn\u2019t say that, I think of a -- ba -- I said something slightly different, my -- I think my most important time was -- the two moments, both when I worked with children. First during the war, when I was in France, because the war came when I had been sent to study in France. And I stayed, I\u2019d -- I fell in love with an English boy, and I was not going to go to -- my mother had married somebody in Geneva, and had gone to live in Geneva, and I was damned if I was going to live in Geneva. Sh -- they put me into a pensionnat de jeune filles there, you know, and I ran away. I mean, it was just outrageous. Somebody who had been in the Reinhardt [indecipherable] you know -- you know, to be then put into a pensionnat de jeune filles, I mean, you must imagine this, us walking in twos, you know? I mean outrageous. Anyway, so I ran away. But they were quite sensible, and they left me in -- in France, and they - finally my -- my mother and stepfather -- and they very sweetly, you know, paid for me to live with a family then, which was the most sensible thing. I mean, I was 15. So anyway -- I can\u2019t remember what I said. Oh yes, well the war came, and I decided to work in a ca -- in a -- with an organization called the Auxiliaire Soc-Sociale, who were taking care of -- well really, what we later called displaced persons, but that is not -- they were called refugees then -- came into Paris from, you know, all the places that the Germans had already overrun. And I was put in charge by the -- the person who was a -- who was the president of this organization, a woman called This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Anyway, Isabelle put me in charge of the nursery. And we had a nursery for -- we -- we took -- didn\u2019t took take away, but we -- we accepted, and the women who came with small babies were absolutely delighted, you know, after walking in the -- on the roads with small babies, they were all exhausted. I mean, that was the main thing that I think I -- I experienced for the first time, you know, the exhaustion of people who run away. It is just terrible. And if you ha -- if you are holding onto perhaps a small child and a baby, as many of them were, it -- 1t was killing. It was killing. They were -- they all arrived, you know, filthy and pale, and oh, awful. And when we offered to take the babies and they could come and see the babies whenever they liked, of course. Some of them were nursing the babies and they came quite often, but anyway, in the night I mean. We didn\u2019t have a single nerve, not a single one. And we ended up at one point with 56 babies in that room. And we had -- we had American members of the Auxiliaire Sociale who were very rich, and it was absolutely extraordinary because first we started of course, with six babies, you know, and we had eight cots. And I said to one of the -- to this woman, who -- this American who was part of the organization, I said, \u201cYou know, I think there are going to be a lot more.\u201d And she said, \u201cHow many do you think there might be?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, 10 - 20?\u201d She said, \u201cRight.\u201d And you know, it was not two hours later that 20 cots arrived, and two nights later we had 56, and they came during the day, and we had 56 cots by that night."

And we set up again, because all these people, you know, all these backers of the Auxiliaire Sociale, lucky they were very rich, and many of them had castles in various corners of -- of France and we got a series of castles -- part of castles put at our disposal for them -- for starting children\u2019s centers. And I took 16 kids on -- I can\u2019t remember the date, but it was the end of May, before the Germans came into Paris, just before to -- to Villandry, which was one of the great chateaux of the Loire, and belonged to Isabelle de la Bouillerie, or rather her mother, who was American.

And they gave us the stables, and they had -- before we came they had some of the castle workers, you know, put beds, iron bedsteads and mattresses into -- and upstairs, they had actually in the stables, I don\u2019t know why. And this is where we had our children\u2019s center. And actually we ended up with I think 20 or 21 children. So that was all right, it was -- 1t was a very -- you know, it was a -- it was certainly for me an incredible lesson when the Germans arrived, and I adore the French. I mean, I was so pro-French, for no reason. I mean, I had nothing to fear with the Germans, and I had no reason to dislike the Germans, except what I had heard, all these elegant people around my mother say -- some of them -- some of them of course were Jews, because you know, most of the- most of the theater people really were Jewish, and -- and most of -- my mother was -- had a lot of newspaper friends, there were a lot of Jews. And so I -- I certainly heard in ma -- my subconscious I heard more things than in my conscious, but I had a real dislike for the Germans, which when they actually came into France, I couldn\u2019t find a reason for. They were very nice when they came to France. They were very nice to the French. They were absolutely charming to me. You know, I had a -- a -- a -- I was introduced by Isabelle, of course it was not beyond making use of whatever she could make use of, so she introduced me with my father\u2019s title, which of course didn\u2019t give me anything at all, but she invented one. So -- because the -- in Hungary the daughter of a count has no title. So -- but I very quickly became countess, and they absolutely adored that, they loved this little Hungarian countess, you know, who spoke perfect German -- Viennese German at that, Volksdeutsch with a [indecipherable] art, you know, loved it -- if you understand that."

I mean, I spoke to so many Germans, most of them as I say, very nice. As the year went on, and things began to happen, you know, people began to be locked up, including friends of mine in Paris, it was less nice. And of course I was able to approach them on this, I mean ask them why, you know. And of course, a lot of Jews in Paris were arrested, which Isabelle learned about very quickly, as she had a very wide circle. And -- and I -- I -- I challenged them on that. And you know, most of them really didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know.

And -- and then of course, you know, it began, I mean you -- you -- you -- there were an awf -- as I told you, there were an awful lot of -- of Jews in the theater world, and I was at the Reinhardt seminar which was -- well, I mean, Reinhardt of course was a Jew. He was not there, I mean he had left in -- he was in Vienna last -- I can\u2019t remember, but I think it was in January of that year. He had done a wonderful production at his theater, which we all, of course, went to the rehearsals, and it was just absolutely wonderful.

I mean, probably there were two great, great actresses in Austria. There was she, and Paula Wessely, two really great actress, and of course we, as very young people, we - we just had adorations for these people, you know. Anyway, she left. That was a blow because we -- we did find out that she left because Reinhardt was a Jew, and he thought that the Germans were coming in. And he was damn right. He thought that the Austrians would not be able to withstand it, and he thought they were -- this I found out much later, but I mean, this is what happened. So, you know, I was a little bit preconditioned against them by this time, all this.

And so I -- I was sent -- I was engaged as a -- as an assistant, because I was young, an assistant child welfare officer. I then became a -- you know, I was promoted, but I went there in a rather junior position, and I\u2019m trying to think where my first assignment was. Yes, my first assignment -- well, I was first, as a matter of fact, my very first assignment was in Dachau, which was quite a shock because I\u2019d -- I didn\u2019t realize that that would be my first assignment. We were all -- we all went first to a t -- a -- a city called Karlsruhe, which was the -- the western allied headquarters for UNRRA. And a huge, huge sort of -- oh, it was this -- you know, former I don\u2019t know what it was, but hundreds of barracks and things, and -- and that\u2019s where we all stayed for awhile, had various lessons 1n this and that, and orientation, and then were assigned from there. And to my great surprise, I was called in and I was told that I was going to Dachau. And I said, \u201cBut there are no children in Dachau.\u201d And the -- the woman who was talking to me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have a rather shocking surprise.\u201d Which I did. I really did have a shocking surprise, because there were a lot of children. Of course, Dachau was not -- you know, Dachau is much misunderstood in the -- in the literature, and by historians. Dachau, as you probably know, was the fi -- I shouldn\u2019t be addressing you, but anyway, Dachau was the first concentration camp the Nazis opened, and it was purely a political camp. It was for -- it was intended for German political prisoners, and some cr -- and some criminal prisoners, who usually became, in fact, the kapos. It was not intended for Jews at all. And later it was represented as an extermination camp, which it never was. I have just read a -- a completely new book, which in fact has not yet been published, but is about to be published in three weeks in America, and it still has this presentation of it, which is really a great shame. This is particularly in America that they misrepresented. It is as if it\u2019s a need, always to associate, you know, the Nazis with the crime against the Jews. Now, of course, all of us who write, up to a point, have to do this, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But if you do that exclusively, then you are misrepresenting history. And you\u2019re misrepresenting what Hitler was, what his plan was, what the whole thing was, and why the danger was so enormous, you know, for the whole of Europe, or the world. I mean, the death of the Jews was the worst thing, of course, and the factory killings, and -- but it was -- basically it was a part of a huge geopolitical program which really the -- most of the world doesn\u2019t know because it has so focused on that one part of it. And it\u2019s understandable, I mean, emotion is understandable, but historically it\u2019s wrong. Anyway, so when I came to Dachau, there was -- there were all these kids. And there were two groups of kids, which is also extremely interesting. There were the child -- there were no Jewish children, virtually no Jewish children. Maybe one or two somewhere, but this was not -- you know, the Jewish children -- no, there were more than one or two, there were -- there were a few, but it was- there -- that was the easiest. They brought in -- UNRRA had a -- had a special issue, like a special division for taking care of -- of Jews who survived the Nazis, and they very sensibly assigned to this, or made responsible for this division, Jewish UNRRA officials. I mean, it was the right thing to do, because they understood better, and they can deal with it better, and they could -- and they would be accepted much better by these victims. And so this is what happened. So in Dachau too, within da -- I mean, I came there very soon after it was -- after the Americans arrived. I mean, really within days. And within -- again within days, some of UNRRA officers arrived, who took away the Jewish children. That was -- you know, that was wonderfully organized. So I was left with another -- with another UNRRA. I think she was -- I think she was a higher rank than I. But anyway, we were friends, though, and oh became -- had become friends. And we put in -- were in charge of these children. And you have -- these were all on the one hand, children whose parents had been brought into -- into Germany as forced laborers. So This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

They spoke no German, they spoke Polish and Russian, and a few words of German here and there. Some Czech children, but mostly, as I say, it was eastern European children, who had either been brought in by themselves, or they had been brought in after their parents had been taken in with them. Because in quite many -- in quite a few cases, the Nazis brought in people from eastern Europe to work in Germany, letting them take their smaller children. In quite a few cases, not -- not -- not -- not -- it was not a rarity. So we were landed with quite a few quite young children, who couldn\u2019t speak [indecipherable] the girl who was -- sorry, the girl who was with me was of Polish descent, an American of Polish descent. She spoke Polish, which was a great help. Anyway, so that was one group, and the other group were German children. And they were the children of the 20\" of July German officers, who had been in the assassination plan against Hitler. This was an extraordinary thing, because here you had these German children, who had gone to elite schools, you know, who were very, very German children."

Most of the UNRRA people came, as I said, from America, or -- or some -- or from England. And then there were, of course, from the 12 nations, but -- but really I had -- I only knew one other person who spoke German, fluent German. So I did find out about this problem. I had no idea how wide it was. I mean, that only came out when the American army people -- I mean the Intelligence people really went into it and they -- they -- well, they investigated this pretty thoroughly, and so did the British.

And of course, the stolen children are a very, very important proof that it was not that. The stolen children were a part of Hitler\u2019s racial plan. And it was a racial, it was purely racial. These children all came, almost all - there were some Greek children, but most of them, the vast majority, they were supposed to have been in -- I can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t swear to this, a -- we were given this figure, and it may be right, it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And most of them, by far, far - and the -- th -- this was -- of course, the -- the figure, which was confirmed by the Poles, because most of them came from Poland and the Ukraine. The Nazis had ordered that a certain number, and I don\u2019t know whether they put this number, I have no idea, but that their officials, who were specially assigned for this program, because this was a huge project, were to bring into Germany, children as of age one, who were blonde and blue eyed. They only wanted blonde and blue eyed children, which -- which of course turned out to be a total nonsense because almost all children are blonde and blue eyed when they\u2019re born, and remain this for, you know, quite a long time, into -- may well be two years. I mean, I had one little thing, a little girl, who I finally got, you know. And who had been -- who I found -- and who had been stolen, and who was apparently blonde and blue eyed. Her foster parents, as I call them, I mean they ri -- she s -- she thought they were her parents, and she adored them, her German parents. And they told me oh, she was the most beautiful blonde, blue eyed baby. And do you know she was almost black haired? And  and her eyes were brown. It was absolutely extraordinary, she was no -- and they had -- you know, they didn\u2019t see this. When this woman, she was in Wirtsburg -- I\u2019m going to start, this all comes back to me. This is not this Johann and -- and -- as I called them, yo -- mem -- Johann and Maria. These are just names I invented, you know, but this woman, when I -- when I saw this little girl, you know, who was adorable, by the way. But -- she was four, not three, she was four. And here\u2019s this dark haired, brown eyed child, who I wasn\u2019t at all sure wasn\u2019t Jewish. And this woman in Wirtsburg, this mum, who adored this child, went on and on about this lovely blue eyed, blonde child. I finally said that frau whatever her name was, \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely adorable, and you\u2019ve done a wonderful job with her, but she is very dark haired and brown eyed.\u201d [indecipherable], she said.

To her, this was the blonde, blue eyed baby who had been given to her. Now these children who were given only -- let me just say this, they were only given to members of the Nazi party of good s -- in good standing, who wanted children, who either couldn\u2019t have children, or whose children had died, or -- or whatever. There was always a good reason. And who were known to be, in all probability would be good parents. They were very, very careful about this. And I did not -- I met a lot of the parents, and of course I met a lot of the children. I did not meet one single child or one German parent where they didn\u2019t love each other."

I mean, he was a -- he had an enormous job. I mean, commandant of Treblinka and commandant of Sobibor, you could not have a bigger job in that branch of the SS or Gestapo. It was impossible to have a bigger job. So of course he had the qualifications. He was a brilliant organizer, which is what was mostly needed. And -- and he was a -- he was a man, in a way -- don\u2019t misunderstand it, but he -- he was a man in a way, of quality, in that he had no -- no vices. He was not a drunkard, he didn\u2019t play around with women. He didn\u2019t, of course, didn\u2019t gamble, or anything like that. And he was not a man given to violence. So there were four things, which no doubt the Nazi bigwigs who appointed him saw just as much as I did. I mean, they had him first -- his first assignment, his first -- I mean, he was a police officer, of course, an Austrian. He was from Wels in Austria. He This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And his first assignment as a police officer, was to become the police head of Schloss Hartheim, which was a euthanasia institute. Bad enough, God knows. And there -- and th-these euthanasia institutes, where they appointed 96 SS people to become either heads or, you know, or officials there. Always in higher positions, of course. Under them they would have Ukrainians and Latvians, and usually Baltics. They could, of course observe and -- and see these quote, qualities, unquote, which I have mentioned. Because already in the euthanasia institute, I mean, it was quite clear that he had these qualities. And so he was -- he was predestined to be promoted, there\u2019s no doubt about it. And then he -- he -- he got these two jobs, first at -- in Sobibor, as a kind of preparation, which he opened, which he started, built. And then of course, the worst one of them all, Treblinka, I mean that was the worst place. Oh, I don\u2019t know whether any of them were worse than any other. I mean, the -- that\u2019s -- they -- they were places, you know, which only existed for killing, I mean, they were not for anything else. Which probably it\u2019s -- it\u2019s too extraordinary that -- that -- that 60 years later you have the same misapprehension, or miscomprehension of these places, which ha -- which existed then. I mean, even now, again, this book I\u2019ve just finished reading, which is about to come out in America, I mean again, I mean these places are -- Dachau is conc -- 1s -- is described as an extermination camp. I mean, total nonsense, you know, it\u2019s full of total nonsense. The -- the whole problem, which has been written about more than any other -- what, any other event in history, this extermination of the Jews, I mean it\u2019s -- really, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ust incredible the number of books and -- and essays, and newspaper a -- films, what -- what have you, which have been done on this subject, and still people don\u2019t know. Too extraordinary. Anyway, there were only -- there were only four of such camps, which were only there for exterminating people, that nobody spent a night there, nobody had a meal there. Nobody washed there. They came in, they were killed, that\u2019s it. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Possibly somebody liked the looks of them. Ho -- what do I know how I chose them? But they chose them, and -- and they were allowed to live for a while, working the camp. The camp had to be worked. The Germans didn\u2019t work the camp, and the Baltics didn\u2019t work the camp. It\u2019s perfectly true that the work Jews worked the camp. And it allowed them to survive, maybe for a week, maybe for a month. Some of them just survived. And you know this was a question I asked -- have asked myself a million times since then -- not a million, but one says a million, but countless times -- what would I have done? And all these people who so readily judge such men and women, instead of judging they should ask themselves this question. I mean, how dear is life to us. And I tell you life is very dear to us, and I am not sure, I am not sure at all, and really I do have principles, but I\u2019m not sure at all that I would not have done what they did. After all, as work Jews, they could help people. They could, and did, very often. They also could be absolutely terrible, and some of them were. Absolutely terrible. Worse than the Germans, certainly. But my God, what would you choose? What would you have chosen? Did you ever think about that?"

And then he gave him the papers he needed, gave him some money. And of course this is a terrible thing, an absolutely terrible thing, but there you were. The Catholic church did many terrible things, they did many not terrible things. It\u2019s -- again, it\u2019s a gray area. Again, nothing is black and white. You know, and they were wonderful people, they were nuns. I mean, God almighty, what the nuns did in Austria and Germany is fantastic. You know, the number of people they hid, children. They hid Jewish children, but not you f -- for -- for a night or for a week, but for months, months.

I think that basically, I mean, if you want to talk ab -- if you want to consider this from a human point of -- or a humane point of view, I think they were all very lonely. You know, most of them were separated by prison and other, from their families, their wives, their children. I mean, certainly in Stangl\u2019s case this was so. Saw themselves sentenced, if not to death, because the death penalty had been abolished, but certainly to life in prison. You know, and they were young, I mean, they were not old men. Stangl, I can\u2019t remember how old he was, but he was certainly not more than what, 35 or 38, I mean he was -- he was young. And the earliest he could have got out of prison -- this is -- he was sentenced to life imprisonment, was when he was 60. Now just imagine a life like that.

And by this time there was the other element, which was A, Stangl -- you have to understand this, Stangl was an Austrian, this why I immediately said he was a provincial Austrian. And we talked to, in my kind of German, which is of course upper class German, we talked to by a young woman, which I was at the time -- I mean, a youngish woman. A youngish woman, you know, a - somebody who represented something. A lady. He\u2019d never met a lady in his life. And suddenly there was this lady who was willing to talk to him, and listen to him. This was extraordinary for him. It\u2019s very hard to explain this to people who don\u2019t know Europe. You know, who don\u2019t know what a provincial Austrian is, or Hungarian.

And Speer read, \u201cInto That Darkness,\u201d which kept him sleepless, he said, for several nights. And -- and he decided that this was somebody he could talk to. Now Speer had talked to a lot of people, you know, because he was, of course, a huge personality, of enormous importance historically. And I suppose every major journalist in the world -- certainly in the western world, tried to talk to Speer. I mean, it would have been insane not to. I didn\u2019t like him. I saw him on TV, I -- you know, I read -- of course I read his books. I thought he was an arrogant man. His charm did not charm me. I thought his - he was very suave, and I couldn\u2019t bear it.

I was so often in Germany, wasn\u2019t I -- blah, blah, blah, blah. And finally I thought, what is the matter with me? I mean, if th -- this man is so desperate for me to do a Stangl on him, okay. I'll do it. You know, as vulgarly as that, I thought. And of course that kind of thought immediately disappeared the moment I met him. I\u2019ve got to say, I mean really. I mean, we were -- we went to have lunch with him and his wife in a Heidelberg [indecipherable], and there was this humble man. On the telephone he was just as arrogant as on TV. So every tra  telephone call supported my -- exta -- not every, some of them there was this curious humility. Anyway, at lunch, I mean, you know, there was a different man. And I thought, well wait a minute, maybe I\u2019m all wrong about this. What is this man, you know? What is this? And of course, he talked a lot during a long, long lunch. And talked a lot about it, about Hitler, which is what I encouraged him to do. And by the end of the lunch, and Don and I went back to our hotel, I said, \u201cJesus, of course the one thing that in all these weeks I didn\u2019t think about, was that this man was the closest to Hitler of anyone in Germany. Am I crazy not to want to talk to him?\u201d Don said, \u201cOh yes, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d So -- so anyway, that\u2019s how it started, you know, and of course the moment I started talking to him, I -- one\u2019s attitude changes. Once -- as I told you, once- once people start talking about their childhood, and with me they always have to talk about their childhood first, because I think everything starts in childhood. I know that this is a -- a clich\u00e9 thing to say, and Freudian and all the rest of it, but it\u2019s not Freudian, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s purely human. It doesn\u2019t apply to everybody either, I have to say. Because you can have a rotten This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So it doesn\u2019t apply to everybody, but somebody who then develops in a certain way, and has had a terrible childhood, then you can find -- you know, you can find connections. And certainly with Speer there were very, very strong connections. He was extraordinary lonely as a child. I mean, the middle child of three, and neither liked by his father, nor by his mother, who liked the two at the other -- one each, you know, of the other brothers. He was very alone throughout his childhood. And -- and -- an-and really suffered under it, I mean, he -- he suffer -- he had a -- he had a suffering childhood, Speer, which is odd. So when he found Hitler, of course 1t must have been the most extraordinary experience. And when Hitler found Speer it must have been the extraordinary experience, because, you know, if you want to make it very simple -- and why not make it simple, then a man who had never been a father, found a son. And a son who had never had a father, found a father. It\u2019s as simple as that, really, except it\u2019s much more complicated. But start with the simple things, and you find answers. Because certainly Speer and Hitler loved each other. They loved each other. And it took Speer -- it took Speer all those years to understand, partly, that there was something terribly wrong. And he never, never understood it really, until he was in Spandau, and was alone, and could read. You know, he read 5,000 books in Spandau. And boy, he could read, you know. And he c -- he -- by the time I met him, he knew -- boy, he knew more than anybody else did. He really did. I think he knew more about the Nazis -- of course, knew more about Hitler than everybody else did, but he understood more than anybody else did. And as for this one part of this Nazism, which everybody, of course, as you -- as you know, I think, is exclusively concerned with, Speer was never an ideological anti-Semite. He was an anti-Semite because they were all anti-Semites. But he was not an ideological anti-Semite. He could manage with anybody, actually. And he could manage, of course after -- I mean, after This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

You see, it was a -- it was a tremendous opening of understanding of what people were, you know. People, that it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not where they come from, it -- but what they are. Which is the only thing that counts. I mean, it doesn\u2019t matter where anybody comes from, what religion, or what they like to call race. I mean, this ridiculous and dreadful word, race. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s totally unimportant, the only thing that matters is what the individual is, with a capital I. And that\u2019s what Speer -- what Speer certainly learned in Spandau. So you know by the time -- by the time he came to me, I mean he was really preconditioned to really talking. And he did, I mean he -- he- Speer t-taught me more than I could ever give him. He would have hated this book, of course, absolutely hated it. He was very, you know, he was very, very dubious about what I would write. And he was so right."
