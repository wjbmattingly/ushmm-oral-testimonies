When they passed by, when I stick out my elbow, they felt 1t. So I was always like a fighter. I was a little boy in the family, but I never ran away from a fight.

Whenever, I\u2019m going one thing to another, in the pockets I always had a piece of rubber from a tire, the rim from a tire inside I always had 15 or 20 inch rubber in the pocket. The pocket was open, but it was in the bottom of the lining. Just on every eventuality what happen. So I was going once one evening in that luncheonette candy store and a couple of boys approached me and I knocked on the window and the other one came out and both of us beat him up and I walked in the store in the back room. A little while later the parents came in, a whole bunch of them, and they want to drag me out. I hold onto the door, they tore out the door and I didn\u2019t gave in.

How I learned the trade is a different story, because when I got there to work there were three brothers working at the same place. Then one somehow left and I worked there with the two others and one was a good mechanic and they didn\u2019t want to show me anything. But I have to admit myself, I was quick with mine eyes.

When I got the week wages, the way I figure, I didn\u2019t have the full amount that was coming to me. Not because she wanted to take it off, to cheat me, but a couple minutes here and a couple minutes there she didn\u2019t figure. So I told the boss, he said, go see my wife. So I went to see her and I told her, this I know, one and two is three. You figure it I said I don\u2019t know and the way I see it, it\u2019s not enough money.

I had a brother there, a tailor, he was doing subcontracting, tailoring, and I went to him for a while, then I went to work for somebody else and I worked until 1939, \u2018till three days before the war broke out. There was a call, that time, for the mobilization of the people who were accepted for the army. I was accepted in 1939, it was May or June, I remember when I stood to the Board and I was accepted to the army but was never taken. But then when they were talking about the mobilization, so I said if I have to go to the army at least I'll go from my hometown and be with the parents to say goodbye. So it took me a day or so to come from Warsaw to my hometown, Bodzanow, because the roads were blocked by the army, the military around, but they never called us.

We came to a border like, we landed and they took us off from the boat and whatever they found, a pair Tfillin, it was used for morning prayer, and the Germans found it and said whose is it and naturally everybody was afraid. So one young man went over and said it\u2019s mine. Whether it was his or not, I don\u2019t know. He gave it to him and didn\u2019t do anything. So they antagonized something then finally they let us go back home. The ferryboat didn\u2019t go to my hometown, it was to the next town , from there is was about 70 kilometers, so I took a walk back to my hometown."

Dig out the other side and put back in the other side. They were taking some people to different towns for hard labor. Two of my friends they took to a town which called Drubnine, I think. One got killed there and the other one, after a long while, he was able to come back home. We couldn\u2019t be in the street. Didn\u2019t let us be in the house. Funny. And we were chased not to work. They made like a committee which for some Jewish people made a committee and they had to do their dirty work for the Germans. Some did as humanely as they could, others were doing very harsh dirty work for the Germans."

So they throw up on the truck some food, bread, Jewish people throwing it. Then they took us to a place called, Dzaldowo. Over there was the same story. When we got to the gate they didn\u2019t let the people get off, they pulled them off, or they hit them and pulled them off.

So I saw on the truck ahead of us a young boy like I got to the gate and he jumped off from the side of the truck to avoid their hitting. When my truck came over, I did the same thing. Momentarily, while I jumped off I said to myself what am I doing. I left my father there, so I walked around the truck to the back where they were taking them off, I took him around my hands and I helped them off the truck and they just lightly touched him, and said, go you old dog. They didn\u2019t hit him. That\u2019s how we got to that town Dzaldowo, was a camp and over there we also saw brutality. There was a young man which they hit him, he jumped like crazy, that\u2019s the way they hit him. A couple people got nearly killed. This was, we got there, I think on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I think on a Thursday they took us out and they took us to Chestochowa. Over there we were spread out in the town in different places. There was a ghetto a big ghetto, later on they made a smaller ghetto. At that time it was still the big ghetto and they located us, Synagogues, community centers and I was fortunate, my parents were fortunate, because of my father, his personality. When they took us to that place, the first was the streets in like a street. Was a Synagogue in the backyard, was a big place, they took us in there and I was bleeded. From Tuesday I wasn\u2019t cared of. The blood was dried up so there came in nurses and doctors came in and helped us and another person from there they saw my father also with the blood so they took him to his apartment. Then in Yaldova we got reunited with my mother and sister and the sister-n-law with the children we got reunited and we got to that place, they took us unto the house, which it was fairly, I mean it was clean. The day they took us to the Synagogue, they put in straw and junk back and that\u2019s where they were laying one on top of the other. While they were cleaning up my head wound there was a young girl coming in and helped attend me to clean me up . And, somehow she took an interest in me. This was in March. On May the 15\" we got married."

And naturally we were driven to work, taken to work and one thing I must say, I was one from the very few, very very few, fortunate people to be together with my wife all the time, since we got married, to work together and for a time wasn\u2019t so nice but unfortunately this was the conditions of life, there were a barrack for couples, married couples, naturally no matter how the conditions were, everyone was trying to keep up self control, self obedience in the cleanliness of the family. We were given a long, what you call a bunk bed, a long. We were making separations wherever we could to make a separation between one couple and another. Unbelievable as it may sound, it was a truth. We kept our dignity as much as possible to keep clean, to keep nice, self -respect. We were together then when they liquidated the big ghetto, which it started on a Yom Kippur day, 1942. At that time we were at the synagogue and we were told that the other end of the city they were liquidating the ghetto. So we were driven out from there to a smaller place to live. Then that house, where we were, it was still considered the small ghetto.. I had a sister of mine there, she lived a different part of the city, which I didn\u2019t see her anymore, Hendle. And then we were taken to work."

In the kitchen, the backyard, whatever it was, we were gone in the morning coming back at night. At one time I ran away from the group where they took us to work. I was hiding, why I did it, I don\u2019t remember even. I was hiding in a like a ditch or whatever it was and for the day. Why I did it I cannot remember. But I couldn\u2019t do anything and then I got back to the work and they went back and somehow snow came. Then my wife was working in the kitchen there so after awhile, like I said, I was fortunate to be with my wife together, like when it was time when it looked bad, they were trying to take the women out, I went to intervene. Later on when they were trying to take the men away, take me away, she went to intervene. At that time when she was working in the kitchen, which it wasn\u2019t too bad, at least we had something to eat, so the foreman like, was a Jewish fellow. There were two brothers and the wife had three sisters. We lived in the ghetto, even before the ghetto, they lived there too. Back to back. So they knew us very well. One of the brothers became the foreman and he want to take away the wife, my wife from the kitchen, take in somebody else. He must have got something from them. So I went to him, my wife went to him, begged him, I\u2019m staying here why are you taking me away\u201d? So his wife told my wife how long isn\u2019t enough to be with your husband together? Do you understand? That brother gave her hell for it. How could you give her hell for it, how could you say it? But, apparently, time is doing is own course. Later on she got separated from her husband and I was with my wife all the time. So then everybody was against it so they made a lottery to see who should remain in the kitchen and who not. So, it so happened, my wife was able to remain in the kitchen. Then this was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, many times I heard like this, my wife asked what\u2019s that, I said it doesn\u2019t look so bad. It made her feel comfortable. There were twice, two moments, she asked me what\u2019s that? In my wildest imagination I couldn\u2019t see anything good, so I said I don\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t ask me anymore. At one time all of a sudden it was at night, they shut off the lights, we were in the factory, we were working the night shift. It was sometime in \u201944, the end of \u00b044. What\u2019s that? I said, I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t find anything, I couldn\u2019t find any excuse. Naturally, we thought for the worst. And the second time, which it was the last moment before we were liberated, she said, we were driven out to the gates from the factory with the trains were outside and all of a sudden we were pushed back, the whole mess was like pushed back. My wife asked me that time, what\u2019s that? This was when it went through the minds, this 1s the end. I said I don\u2019t know and she didn\u2019t ask anymore. We held on for a couple of minutes, then we could spread. It got over. What it was, I don\u2019t know. Some people were taken out t the train a the time and the bulk of us remained. There were three other camps in Chestochowa, ammunitions factory. I worked ammunitions factory and the day before we were liberated, the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection day when we were liberated, to me it seems to be the 15\u201c of January, \u201945. Yeah, I have to go back to a little incident before that. The end of \u201944 we were all mechanics, I was a tailor, but I was a mechanic at the machine. There was one Jewish fellow, he was the main mechanic of those machines. We had there a German boss which it didn\u2019t bother him. He said you don\u2019t bother me, I don\u2019t bother you. I did some tailoring for him I did some fixings for him sometimes. He was foolish, but it didn\u2019t bother him any, didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Then they took him away and came in another one. They used to call him the mischugana, the crazy . He was crazy, foolish. You couldn\u2019t talk to him anything, couldn\u2019t talk to him, there was no way. So the boys said let\u2019s try to bribe him, maybe we could persuade him to be a little bit. So we did whatever we could to try to bribe him. Whenever he used to pass by my wife when she worked at the machine, sometimes a shell we would find on the floor, or whatever it was he hit her. He passed by, because he worked on the same shift and there was another one, he hit her too, but sometimes he gave her a piece of bread too. And this one, whenever I passed by she was crying. One time I passed by she said was it night? She was crying, I said what\u2019s the matter she said I don\u2019t know, everything was going perfect. He hit me with a screwdriver. So I go over to that boy and I said, listen you\u2019re trying to bribe him, at least let him show some decency. Well, he said the slogan was, if not today, it will be tomorrow. Which it meant if we won\u2019t be finished today, we going to be finished tomorrow. As weak as I was I said no, not enough. I don\u2019t buy it. And I find in between two machines, he was a short fellow, he wasn\u2019t taller than me and I went over to him and I yelled at him. I said why did you hit my wife for nothing. If you going to hit my wife for nothing, hit me, I\u2019ll be able to take a beating, but don\u2019t hit her. And he started beating me up. While he was beating me up I was screaming to him the same thing, next time do the same thing, but don\u2019t hit my wife. It\u2019s unbelievable because he didn\u2019t have to take me out to shoot, to kill, he could kill me on the place. But apparently, he didn\u2019t do it and since then he didn\u2019t touch her again. This was before Christmas time \u201944, about three, four weeks before. Then the 15\" of January in the morning, they didn\u2019t took us out from the barracks. We remained in the barracks. Like normally, we used to go out to work. A day before, the evening before, they took out about 700 people from the shift from the night before. At that time it looked, it didn\u2019t look good. At one time before, like I said I had my sister in Philadelphia, America, home I never used to write the letters to her. But when the letters used to come she used to live at 633 North 5\", Philadelphia, Pa., USA. At one time it just him me, came into my mind the address. I used to say it in Polish. I took the address, I wrote down on a piece of paper, just like this. When it looked so bad, I said to my wife, you see, here I give you my sister\u2019s address. If we\u2019ll survive there we\u2019re going to meet. This happened the 15\" of January, the 15\". So in the morning we didn\u2019t go out to work because they took out the night shift the night before. Later on around 9 o\u2019clock or so, 10 o\u2019clock, we had to go out to the appel and stand up in the line and the bosses came around to take us to work. We had one boss which he was fairly a decent man. Unfortunately one time he took, he killed, shoot a woman. Whether he was drunk, it was a little instigation from somebody else and he passed by our group and told us in German, naturally not, it should be noticeable that he is talking to us, to take with you clothes. To take in the factory. Like he knew something, something is going on. So we went in the factory, our group, and while we were in the factory, I took the coat, whatever my wife had and mine, put in a room wherever we had to do for the machines, and I\u2019m there for a minute or two minutes, a boy comes in and says, Moishe go out take a look where your wife is. I went out I see her come in from outside. The boss who had the shift before, so he want to keep his women, he want to keep, and send away the others. So she went over to him, it was the 15\" of January, it was cold, she said I want go take mine coat from my husband and I will be back. He said go, but come right back. So naturally I went over to that boss, he knew me, not the one who hit my wife before, but the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection other one, higher than him, and I told him my wife they\u2019re going to take out, do something. He said I\u2019m powerless, there\u2019s nothing I can do. There was, the main engineer from the whole factory there, the ammunitions factory. So the main engineer from the whole factory, in normal times, everybody was afraid for his look. Terrible, terrible man. At that moment he stood with a stick and he was hitting over the head everybody whoever came to him. Why, it was plain and simple. They were trying to take out the people and people were running back. Nobody wants to go away. Everybody wants to stay in the place and they were taking them out and they were running back. So he was hitting everybody over the head, wherever he could. And while he stood with his stick hitting everybody over the head, unbelievable as 1t may sound, how I did it, I don\u2019t know, but I did something. I went over to him and I said, engineer, I\u2019m here from the first moment when the place started, now they\u2019re going to send out my wife. If they\u2019re going to send her out, I\u2019m going to go with. I scared him off. So he said, where is the boss? He called over the boss, not the one who hit her, but the other one who hit her from time to time, but he gave her a piece of bread too. He said do you know her?. He said yes. Is she a good worker, he said yes. He said remain here. Another boy did the same thing for a girl and she also remained. How I did it, I don\u2019t know. But it was a rumor just imagination 1t was, supposedly you\u2019re supposed to say they should have left his father that the boy should remain here. So somehow I did it and that\u2019s how we remained together. Later on I gave her the address from my sister and said, because it looked like something is going to happen. So I said if we\u2019ll survive, there is going to be a place where we met. O.K. Then we are still in the factory, we were going to lunch to bring the pot with the lunch and that time I went to the kitchen to bring in the lunch for the group. Then we got a lunch and I sat down on the floor near the machine, while I was sitting eating we heard some banging, to bang a big factory. So I didn\u2019t pay too much attention after awhile another repeat, didn\u2019t pay attention yet, but then it didn\u2019t took long another few minutes we heard more banging. So I said that time to my wife, because she was sitting with me near the machine, I said now I\u2019|l put away the food what I had, let\u2019s pay attention what\u2019s going on. So after awhile we saw the Germans through the window, we could see that they start running. Then one of the German bosses came in and he said to the other one, he said what\u2019s going on with you don\u2019t you see what\u2019s doing outside already? Stop the work. So they stopped the work and we were driven out to the barracks. There was a factory , a munitions factory, a bigger one than ours. When the Russians came close to that they evacuated the factory and it took about six months till the Russians came in that time. So they were told, the rumors were going on, the Germans said they were supposed to leave the factory with the people. The factory should be able to go till the last minute, cause it was a bigger factory than ours. This apparently what they did. In our place, in our situation the factory was running until the last minute. But still we were afraid that they\u2019 Il tear off the bounty () place with the people. This was the thought what it may happen. This is what they did in some other places. So we were in the barracks and around it starts to get dark already, one of the Germans came in with a sack of bread giving out bread. So whoever could reach it got bread. Then the commander from the camp start to go around and calling the people said to go with him. He said I was for you like a father, come with me, the Russians are coming, come with me. And unfortunately, a couple hundred people went up."

Around 10 o\u2019clock the fire engines, the fire people from the fire engine company they came around and told us now you are free, just watch out from upstairs from the planes. It was only a wild dream to be able, I don\u2019t know whether I even identify, but subconsciously there was some kind of hope in the back of the conscience that maybe, maybe.

He too was a tailor and while we were in the camps in the same barracks we used to make caps by hand, little caps be able to wear it.

Unfortunately, very few people survived that camp. She was there with four children, a son and a daughter in that camp where my sister was 1n another place of work, the same camp, another two daughters. That daughter that she was with was doing tailoring. She was working for the Germans. One time she found out it\u2019s going to be a selection to take up people. So being my sister was an elderly woman then, white, grey hair, so she said to her mother, Mom, go hide yourself because there\u2019s going to be a selection they\u2019re going to take up people. So my sister listened and she hid herself. Fortunately from that particular group where they were, they didn\u2019t took up anybody. So, it was good. A while later she comes back again and says Mom, go hide yourself they\u2019re going to take up people again a selection. So my sister says, nah, they didn\u2019t take then they\u2019re not going to take now either. She didn\u2019t want it. It so happens they took out my sister. So the two kids went over to Mom and said, Mom, where you're going, we are going. Mom started to beg them said, me, all right, it\u2019s me, I\u2019m elderly already, so you\u2019re still young you still have a chance. They said no, where you go, we go. The other two kids they couldn\u2019t reach because they were a different place of work. So what happened, those few people what they took out they sent them to a different camp, the remain bulk of the people they all got wiped out. That\u2019s how she remained alive with the two children."

When we got off the ship and the port went through all the formalities, the paper work, I started to look around. Was a huge hall, a huge building.

                " Anything else to add? Yes. There were times which we couldn\u2019t talk about the Holocaust. I think that most of us came to the conclusion we should talk about, we should tell about what we lived through and the world population with few exceptions stood silent, callously silent, to the annihilation of six million Jewish people. Among them a million and a half children. Children which they never had a chance to see the world with its beauty what they taste the tyranny of the people. We should talk about, especially now, they are so called educators, they are so called educators that they are denying the Holocaust. They say it only in our imagination. Things like this never happened. How kind of vultures can I say those people are. They denying the existing of us survivors who went through hell and they know about, but still they are denying it. We should remember, we remember, we should never let the people forget what we Jews went through, other Nations too, but there is a difference between us Jews and other Nations. We were annihilated for one reason and for one reason only. Just because we were Jews. There was said this Hitler may he rest in hell, wherever he 1s, said, if hell find a Jew in45, he is going to kiss his head. Thank G-d there are Jews survived him, there is Israel which hopefully will exist and he is in hell wherever he is. We a long accounting to do with people. So called friends. We hoped that the world will realize and help Israel, the Jewish Nation live in peace. Unfortunately, so- called friends are doing very little to help Israel in peace. But let\u2019s hope we are out making people hopefully will exist for many years to come. And I thank you Anthony Di Iorio. I thank you for coming into the house and telling my story of life. Maybe it\u2019s not so but it\u2019s a story of life which we went through. Many people may say, why didn\u2019t you fight back? But there is a saying that it is always good to be a quarterback next day after the game. Unfortunately, this was the story with us. There were very few which were able to fight back, to resist. The greatest resistance from the people was to exist and try to conduct as humanely as you could with all the bad luck situations where we lived, conditions where we lived, and we resisted to be able to exist and I think this is the greatest resistance what every human being could do. And I thank you again for coming. You had a long day. Q; Thank you for having me. I probably should say for those who will hear this tape that hard necking people, we should say that means stubborn and tough. ",
                " Right, right. I just couldn\u2019t bring out the proper word for it. There is the Hebrew translation for it, Em shay oraf, the heart necking stubborn people. With all the humiliation that we had we still were able to bring up a second generation nice young people who do take an active part to keep up the Holocaust memory and the memory of the grandparents that they had lost. It\u2019s very heartwarming for those youngsters to be. "
