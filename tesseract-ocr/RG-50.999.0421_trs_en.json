Thank you for\njoining us. We are in our 14th year of First Person. Our First Person today is Mr. Morris Rosen,\nwhom we shall meet shortly.\nThis 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis Franklin\nSmith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring First Person.\nFirst Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with\nus their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each guest serves as a\nvolunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue through mid August. The museum's\nwebsite at www.ushmm.org provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.\nMorris Rosen will share with us his First Person account of his experience during the\nHolocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time, at the end of the program there\nwill be an opportunity for you to ask Morris a few questions.\nThe life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear\nfrom Morris is one individual's account of the Holocaust.\nWe have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.\nWe begin with a portrait of Morris Rosen, born Moniek Rozen, son of Jakub Rozen and Golda\nChaya Warszawski in 1922. Morris was born in Dabrowa Gornicza in Upper Silesia where his father\nwas an Official distributor of tobacco and acetylene. The arrow on the map of Poland points to the\nlocation of Dabrowa.\nHere we have a 1924 portrait of one of Morris' sisters, Rozia Rozen Bilauer, who survived in\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ;\nthe USSR during the war.\nThis photograph is of Morris and his friends on a hillside in Dabrowa. Morris is at the top.\nAs you will hear shortly, Morris survived several Nazi camps, then after a six-week forced\nMarch he arrived in the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. The arrow points to\nBuchenwald.\nEventually, in 1945, Morris was liberated from the Theresienstadt camp in occupied\nCzechoslovakia by the Soviet Army.\nWe close this brief slide presentation with a photograph of Morris with Regina Zilberstein,\nabout whom we shall hear more later.\nMorris came to the United States in late 1949 and, following seven years of art school, built a\nsuccessful contracting business in Baltimore, where he continues to live today.\nHe is well-known as a stamp, postcard and letter collector, especially for his Holocaust postal\nhistory collection including those from Nazi-created ghettos in Poland. He is also recognized\nworldwide for his collection on the Olympics and has traveled and lectured about this collection as\npart of the Olympic games. He has exhibited at numerous US and international exhibitions, including\nin Nuremberg, Germany, and in Israel. | am pleased to share with you that today Morris is donating\nto this museum several items from his collection of postcards, documents and correspondence from\ncamps and ghettos.\nMorris speaks frequently about his Holocaust experience at such places as the headquarters\nof the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the US\nArmy's Aberdeen Proving Grounds and Fort Meade in Maryland. He also speaks to students at\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nnumerous Baltimore-area schools and other locations.\nBesides his volunteer work in this museum's archives, Morris has been a volunteer with the\nRed Cross Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and Information Center. He was named the\nBaltimore-Washington, DC Man of the Year for the American Red Cross. Morris, who lost his wife in00, has two sons and two grandchildren.\nFinally, | think you should know that in addition to his vigorous gardening that he continues,\nMorris works out three times a week doing, are you ready for this, Zumba.\n[Laughter]\nWhich combines Latin and international music with dance as an exercise program. However, his\ndoctors have ordered him to no longer go on his steep roof to clean gutters and do repairs.\nWith that, | would like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Morris Rosen.\n[Applause]\nThank you for joining us.\n>> Morris Rosen: Thank you for that introduction. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, it's\nvery difficult to condense five years of the darkest chapter in mankind history into 45 minutes.\nBelieve me, | would talk all day. But unfortunately, | have to skip many months, a year or two, but it's\nimpossible to do five years what | went through, which | remember every day of life in the camps.\nThank you.\n>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Morris. And thank you for being willing to do this with us. Before we turn\nto the war years and the Holocaust, tell us just a little bit about your family and your life before the war\nbegan. Just a little bit.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Morris Rosen: Well, before the war | was well-known in school, because | was an athlete all the\ntime in school. Had many, many friends, not only Jewish friends, but gentile, we were very close.\nBut everything changed in 1938 during the crystal night in 1938. This was November 8, they started\nboycotting our store also. Although it wasn't Poland, in southern Poland, Silesia. People that knew\nus, students that | went to school with, they boycotted. | remember two sisters, they took a broom\nfrom the store, started chasing away the ones that they told everybody, don't buy from Jews, this,\nthis, and that. It didn't help. We had to close up our store. That's what happened. It's a very short -\n>> Bill Benson: Tell us about your father's business and what happened to it after Hitler came to\npower in Germany.\n>> Morris Rosen: Well, after Hitler came to power, it was very, very bad. First of all, you have to give\nup everything. If it was radios, other things, valuables, people that they own stores for so many years\nthe Germans take over the stores. They closed up, and it was tough.\nAfter 6:00 in the evening, they announce whoever is going to be caught on the street might get\nshot or in prison. You couldn't walk any more than two or three people, the most. Not gathering, not\nin the church, not to synagogue. It was very, very tough. It was restrictions, and then they made us\nput off this was -- this was already in November 1939. They made us wear armbands on the left\nhand, white armbands with the Jewish star. This is, if they needed any forced labor or to do any dirty\nwork when Germans moved in some places, we had to do the dirty work. It was very easy to\nrecognize the people. This was there.\n>> Bill Benson: Let's go back a little to the actual beginning of the war, September 1, 1939. You\nremember that?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Morris Rosen: Oh, yeah. It was about 5:00 in the morning. | was sleeping very sound. Suddenly,\n| heard noises from airplanes, | look out the window. | mean, the sky was dark from the planes, over, what | count. They flew very, very low, and the reason they flew low, because they dropped the\nfifth column, which they were dressed in civilian clothes. They were actually army people. They were\nthe ones that they let know the German army, with assistance from the Polish army, was safe to go,\nwhere it's not safe to go. But the Polish army kept a lot of them, which they hung them in the woods.\nThey took off everything, except their underpants. This is shameful, because they were not soldiers;\nthey were just like private people, not army. They didn't wear the uniforms.\nWe started to run away also from our home, because we were very close to the German\nborder. We heard already the canons, bombardments and everything. We started running away.\nOnce you were expelled from Germany, from Hamburg to our city, but we run away. After about five\ndays, we were caught by the Germans near the river. That's when we started to be overcome.\n>> Bill Benson: What did you find when you went back home?\n>> Morris Rosen: So many Jews were already killed at that the. One was a good friend of ours. It\nwas rough. It was miserable. Food, you couldn't buy any food. There was a special place where\nJews can only buy bread in a certain bakery, a Jewish bakery. And you have to stay for hours in\norder to get bread. | was all night long hidden in the little woods, and then to be the first one to be at:00 in the morning to stay at line.\n| came out at 7:00 in the morning, it happened that a German battalion on the bikes came\nover, wanted to keep order. One Polish guy, which he didn't belong to them, he said all the Jews. |\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\ngot kicked in the back. \"You can eat the dirt. You get home, with no bread.\" | started crying, after\nstaying all night long. It was tough.\n>> Bill Benson: Morris, you were at the start of the work in September 1938, October, you were not 7\nyears old.\n>> Morris Rosen: No.\n>> Bill Benson: One of the first things you were forced to do was help build a scaffold.\n>> Morris Rosen: Yes. What happened, they formed a Jewish council. The Jewish council was\nresponsible for every order that the Germans gave, they have to do the dirty work. The Germans\ndidn't do the dirty work.\nThey started a Bauleitung, a construction company. You would be lucky to get in. | know my\nfather paid a lot of money. Why? First, we were more safe not to be sent to Germany. Second, you\ngot a little bit extra food. My first job | became a bricklayer, painter and carpenter. My first job was as\na helper carpenter to build hanging scaffolds in the market. | will never forget this. We did about 10\nhanging scaffolds. It was scary. Then the police, German police, not soldiers, went from every\nperson they took away their IDs, you had to have IDs, otherwise you couldn't walk on the street.\nYou'd be 11:00 at the market, you get back. Otherwise, you don't get back your ID.\nIt happened the next day, | saw it myself. They brought 10 -- at the foundry, before the war\nthey made all of the locomotives for Poland. During the war they made parts for planes. Motors for\nplanes for the Germans. They brought 10, and one of them they did sabotage, that's the reason.\nThis is not right. They didn't do anything. They did in every city in Silesia. They hung people for\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nsabotage which people didn't do, just to scare of the people. That's why they were successful,\nbecause they murdered, they killed and people were scared. That's what happened.\n>> Bill Benson: Morris, about that time, | think your sister Rozia, who we saw a picture of, she\nescaped to Russia.\n>> Morris Rosen: What happened, she lived in Bedzin, which was 65% Jewish people. When the\nGermans came in about a week later, they burned the synagogue there. When they burned the\nsynagogues, the rabbi wanted to save the holy scriptures. They pushed them into the synagogue.\nPeople were watching, because it was like a Jewish city, everybody was pushed in there to the\nsynagogue, and they put fire to the synagogue.\nNext to it was a church there. The priest from the church opened the gates, metal, he pointed\nout to people that they looked out the window. Several did, about 12 people jumped down. He\nunlocked the gate, they were safe. Then the Germans went house by house, chase out the Jews,\nthen the synagogue. Machine-gunned it. One of it, | met in Israel, | exhibited in Israel my stamp\ncollection of the Olympics, and | talked also about it, what happened at the ghetto. Said, you want to\nmeet somebody that was right there? You come to the meeting. He picked me up, went there to the\nmeeting, which is from my region, from Silesia, the room was full from papers from the priest that\nsaved the Jews. He was one that chased out from the house, and he was shot, but he managed to\nrun into the church there. The priest locked the door, and he showed me a bullet hole here. He was\ntreated, but | took pictures, if | told the story, of the man that actually survived this and lived through.\n>> Bill Benson: Your sister went to Russia?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Morris Rosen: My sister when she saw hanging Jews, 35 Jews hung in the market, after the\nsynagogue was burned, she came home, said goodbye to my father, her husband, said I'm going.\nBecause the Russians at that time were in good things with the Germans, because they signed a\npact. She managed to escape. She swam through the river to Russia. Some of them, the Russians\nsent back. She was lucky with her husband. About four weeks later, we received the first postcard, |\nremember the stamp has a horse that | collected stamps as a youngster. She walked -- she never\nknew Russian all the time. She walked in a bank, and then she escaped further when the war broke\nout. It's along story. Bult it's not her story, it's mine.\n[Laughter]\n>> Bill Benson: You were a bricklayer for a while.\n>> Morris Rosen: Yes.\n>> Bill Benson: Assistant carpenter. But before long, you were forced to become a painter. That\nwould play a really important role in your survival.\n>> Morris Rosen: In the ghetto | worked painting. The Germans sent me away. In fact, every Friday\nevening | walked to three buildings for the Germans, which was a police state. In the third building,\nunfinished yet, paint and everything. Every Friday my older brother, myself, went through the woods,\nwhich was about 20 kilometers through the woods, and to be there Friday evening, this was the\nsafest place. Even | have such a good ID card sometimes it didn't help.\nSo | was hiding at the police station. This was the safest place. But the war soon came, which\n| have to skip also. It was March 1942 that they called all of the Jewish girls in our city from 12 years\nold to 30 to register, that they're going to work in the shop for the Germans as tailors, and they should\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\ncome register. Whoever won't register won't get any food stamps or anything.\nThey came there to the place, to Chemnitz, which was a transition camp, and they were\nexamined by a doctor. They didn't let them out no more. My father went there, tried to get out. Didn't\nhelp anything.\nTwo days later, they shipped them away. Let me tell you, my house was like after a funeral.\nCan you imagine a 12-year-old girl, the youngest, to be taken away. My mother cried constantly. My\nfather. It was like after a funeral. It was terrible. Till about three weeks later, we got the first postcard\nfrom her that she works in lower Silesia, in a camp, in a factory where they make clothing and\neverything, 12 hours a day, if it's possible to send some packages of food. So we knew they're\nhungry.\nMy mother baked everything she could. | could go to the post office. Though it was restricted.\nIt was already in our city, the ghetto, which you couldn't go everywhere. We were still not in the\nghetto. And | went to the post office and mailed those packages all the time. But the war thing\nhappened, | never forget, was August 10, 1942. There came an order from the Jewish community,:00 in the morning, we have to come near the Jewish community there was a stadium, to be there at:00 in the morning. Put on your summer clothing, so you look presentable. There you will get new\nID cards.\nWe waited till 8:00 in the morning. It was so hot, August, the hottest season in Poland. Kids\nwere crying. Of course, they were thirsty, no water, no nothing. People were fainting from the heat.:00, 8:00 in the morning | thought something is not kosher like, to say. Came three cops with SS\nand soldiers. On the roof were already soldiers with machine guns. Something smells. | saw it is not\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nright.\nAt that time, | walked as a -- worked as a painter, but the head of all of the gestapo in Silesia,\nDreier, | did painting for him. My father too. We came in the morning. They put up three tables.\nThere came a selection. The one, the elder people, over 40, some people younger, but they have\nbeards, you know, go to the right. To the center were people that haven't got IDs, young people, but\nthey're still able to work. Went to the center. The left is like people like my brothers and I, that we\nhave ID cards, we work for the Germans, to the left.\nAbout 10:00, they finish, they march all the people, about 2,000 of them, to Bedzin, next city.\n| didn't know where to go in, because my father didn't keep them in our home. | found out\nwhere they were in Bedzin, so at 8:00 in the morning | went there to see my parents if | can get first\nthe key to the house. Who was there? Jewish police, not German. They didn't let me in. What do\nyou want? | knew a policeman from our city. | said | just want for a second. | am there for a minute, |\ncome back out.\nThe scene | was there, crying, | will never forget in my life. | saw my father, gave me his keys,\nhis pocket watch. My mother said don't forget your younger sister, 12 years old. See to send the\npackages. See that she gets the best. That's the last time | saw my parents.\n| came back to work there, | told him you promised me my parents would be safe.\nOh, don't worry. | find them. Like you found them, like he did.\nOn the third day, | went back from work, | worked with my older brother, | walked through the\nfields, not the city. | see somebody wave to me like this. It was my friend's father, my best friend's\nfather. | said this is the transport. German soldiers are there, on the roof, on the outside. As | wave,\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nsuddenly a German started shooting. So | jumped in there, waited 10 minutes. When | didn't see the\ntrain anymore, | went home.\nWent home, the next day | get from the Jewish community we have to move to the ghetto. We\ndidn't even have time to cry after my parents. You were busy moving. What can you move? We\ndidn't have horse and wagon or anything. We got a little two-wheeler. What did we pack? Some\nbedding. We took my father's library, because he has a very well-known library, books, Jewish books\non history from the 17th century, 18th. This | took. What can you take? The rest, everything we left.\nWe came back to the ghetto. We were 16 people, nine girls, seven boys. Just hay on the floor,\nwooden floor. We let the girls sleep there. We went to sleep outside. When it rained, we stood in the\nfoyer like this.\nThere was one lady, she was pregnant, she begged me, she baked something for her husband\nin a forced labor camp. This is important to you when | tell you later the story. He was our tailor that\nactually for my bar mitzvah, if you Know what it is, he did my suit. He was our tailor from home.\nTo him | sent the packages. And then came the high holidays about a week later, we went to\nthe cafe, everybody cried. After that, | have a friend. We were five people, very good friends. One of\nthem was very poor. He didn't have no parents. He had the elder brother that went to the Polish\narmy. He didn't come back. He probably got killed.\nHe was so hungry, he didn't have food to live. That he went as a volunteer to the slave labor.\nSo we put some money together. | went and bought some on the black market, some beer,\nsome kielbasa, good good oils, went to a garden there to someone's, we had a little party there, and\nthat man that was so poor, he was so talented, he was a good singer. Every time he saw a picture\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nwith Fred Astaire, he did step dancing, like, like Fred Astaire. | never met him after the war. | have\npictures of him.\nThen | came home, | have a letter from the Jewish community that this gets you on the special\npermit, they sent me to a leather factory. There we were about eight months. After eight months,\nthey were only in the factory two Jews. One was the chief engineer for leather that he knows what to\ndo everything, a scientist. The other one that knew the motors. That man, one of them went to\nBedzin to see his brother. Never came back. They caught him, he never came back. He left his wife\nand little child.\nAbout a week later, we got the food from the Jewish community. | heard there was no more\nJews there, it was clean of Jews. | thought | might escape, because | came, went by a church,\nsomebody whistled. It was a Jewish guy. He says come with the bread. | said no, the people won't\nhave anything to eat. The next morning, 6:00, who comes in? SS with the truck. They took us all\nthen. But one, a friend of mine, an electrician that used to go with me, he must have escaped\nthrough a window, but | never heard him after the war. | don't know if he made it or not.\nThere was a lady, the wife of the engineer with the little baby, who we saw. | held the baby\ngoing to the train, and when we arrived, | gave back the baby, lucky me. Right away, the SS came\nfor her in the private car, took away the baby. If | would hold the baby, | would go with her, because |\nam her husband. They took them to Auschwitz. We didn't know at the time what Auschwitz meant.\nWe were the ones cleaning out the ghettos, because no more Jews were there. Mountains of shoes\nand leather, bedding to separate, this to separate.\nOn the third day, we stood at the guard going to the ghetto. Here comes Ludwig. Ludwig was\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nthe head of the slave labor in all of camps, and the concentration camps.

They helped me move the furniture. | started painting. Nobody was\nhome. A beautiful Polish woman about 25, 26, like a movie star, blonde hair. She didn't even give\nme a glass of water, anything.
