This is an interview with Esther Dezube and her dog is also in the room, conducted by Regina Baier on December 7\", 2000, in Mrs. Dezube\u2019s home in Boston. Mrs. Dezube is the daughter of Amalie and Norbert -- Norman Salsitz, Holocaust survivors who have been interviewed for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s oral history collection. This interview is part of the USHMM\u2019s post Holocaust interview project. The US Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. Oh, be quiet. This is tape number one, side A. We are off to a good start here. So as I said, there is a dog with us in the room, but I think if we put her outside, it would be even louder, so hopefully our listeners will understand and even enjoy at times. My first -- my first question 1s, give us your full name, and when and where you were born.",

            "answer": "Well, it\u2019s hard to bring them to life, because I really never met them. But my first name is Esther, which is my father\u2019s mother\u2019s name. And I don\u2019t know a lot about her. I know a lot more about my father, and how he survived the war, but not so much about the personality of the mother, or the father, for that matter. My middle name is Cylia. That\u2019s after my mother\u2019s sister Cylia. I know a little bit about her. I know all the good qualities about her, and my mother seemed to adore her. I don\u2019t know a lot about her otherwise. And that\u2019s it. I actually -- my kids are named after survivors as well. And we did one other thing for our children. All their names equal, all the letters. They have 18 letters in their names. And 18 is a very special number in the Jewish religion, because it means chai, it means life.

Is there anything that sort of comes to mind, that gives an impression of what it was. So their father sang to you, what -- what -- what else?",
            "answer": "Oh, he would tell me the -- I mean, that\u2019s what he would tell me, he would tell me about Hitler, and -- and -- and children being killed in the war. I think he learned actually to temper his stories as he got older. He would tell me, you know, the children\u2019s fats were made into soap. He would tell me that -- you know, his -- his n nieces and nephews were killed and they were my age. He would say that -- it would even start with food. I was a very fat child, and they were very proud of it. They were proud that I was fat because they had enough food to give me and children were starving in the Holocaust. That I remember very distinctly, I was not allowed to leave the table without finishing all the food, because the children in the Holocaust were s  would starve, and I should appreciate all that."

It affected me in other ways that I didn\u2019t have a family. It affected me that, you know, I saw my friends with grandparents and stuff like that. But the actual stories?

I didn\u2019t have to take a fairy tale and try to then say oh, I\u2019m going to transfer this fairy tale to something that happened in real life. These were presented as real life stories, that really happened to them. So I knew it was my parents. I knew it -- that everything belonged to them, that I was part of that history. And they kept telling me I was part of that history. That I should be a good Jew, I guess, because I am a -- because I was born, it was their fight against Hitler. I mean, I had to maintain that. That is something that I was brought up constantly.

I mean, you watch on TV, that\u2019s where you make your comparisons. And you always wanted to be like the family on TV, not so much like your friend\u2019s family, but the family on TV. Cause they always complained about their parents, too. I didn\u2019t have a close home life. My mother -- I was closer to my mother than my father, only cause my father wasn\u2019t home. My father is a very driven man. Probably is why he survived. But also, he was an immigrant in a country and he had to prove himself.

He would come back from meetings at 10 o\u2019clock at night, and when I was young I was already in bed. He loved to listen to Yiddish mo - music, which is not something that I liked. And on the weekends they would go a lot with their friends. I was a tagalong only because they didn\u2019t have a babysitter, and they would speak Polish, which 1s a language that I never learned. So I had to create my own world. I mean, I used to have dinner with my mother. She\u2019d u -- have the - she loves the radio. So either she had music or news in the background. And she\u2019s very political oriented. And so she would always talk all about all the political situations and I had to always be a-abreast about it. And that would be our pul -- our  our life. My parents didn\u2019t really integrate with me. Maybe it\u2019s part of the inte - European culture. But we didn\u2019t do -- we went on vacations. We\u2019d travel a lot. We didn\u2019t do a lot as a family, not that I can recall. My mother, again, she wouldn\u2019t take me shopping. She laughs at me when I say that. Oh well, you know, I took you on these trips instead of shopping. We didn\u2019t do the normal family stuff. My mother liked to read, and that\u2019s what she did. I don\u2019t recall us ever engaging 1n board games. I don\u2019t ever a -- we nev -- it was as if they were tired of life. And I couldn\u2019t relate. I mean, again, that\u2019s also fantasy.

And that\u2019s why it was so important, even though math was never a strong point. And it was just not a subject that I excelled in. I was always on the debating team, I was on the speech team.

I mean, if it was just lab work, I got A\u2019s in biology lab work and stuff. So that\u2019s the freshman year of college she called me a failure.

Old Testament and New Testament, excuse me. But your equivalent of -- of the Old Testament, it\u2019s in there, and it says, you shall remember. So that is an very big holiday an-and it\u2019s a unique holiday because it\u2019s family oriented in the home. You don\u2019t go to temple, necessarily, for Passover.

You had to go with a Roman Catholic group, led by a priest to Poland.

My mother didn't bring it up either. She basically said, you know, let us blend in right now. And I remember the priest took a liking to me, and he always tried to make me go to confession to all these different churches. And I kind of bowed out. And we had one week that we were spending with our friends, with the people that helped save my father, and the people who helped save my mother. But while we were in the tour group, there was also a -- a group, they were the fir -- there was a group of first Christians or something like that, they were from Ohio, and they don\u2019t cross themselves either, and they don\u2019t go into confession. So I kind of said I -- I can\u2019t do that, or whatever. And he had no clue that I was Jewish, none. And there was a woman there who right away everybody knew she was Jewish. She also had a -- she was from Auschwitz, so she had the symbol. But even before, they kind of knew. They used to tell Jewish jokes on the bus, and they still made fun of Jews. Hardly any Jews in Poland at the time and they still made fun of us. And I -- and I knew then how my mother felt. I used to wear a Moses holding the 10 commandments. I wore it on the inside. It was very interesting. Then we spent a week with the families. And I met Mundek, but we couldn\u2019t talk to each other. But he was if -- there was like a light in his eyes. He was a very interesting, very nice man. But I spent -- we stayed at the house that -- of the woman who saved my father, because she had a house in Warsaw. And she had two children my age.

Holocaust was never brought up, never discussed it. There was a language barrier. But there was one boy who came over who did bring it up. And -- and we liked each other. And I said to him, by the way, do you know that I was Jewish? I had to tell him, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- something compelled me that I had to tell him who I was. And he said to me, we\u2019re all children of Moses. But he was the only one of the group who went to the university. So it was very different, but I felt very strange there. You know, you would o -- go with other pe -- I would not -- I mean, he knew I was Jewish. And of course, I thought the other children knew because of what their parents told them. But it\u2019s just not -- I was told in some parties not to bring it up. And then we went, you know, to see my father\u2019s house. And I felt -- then I felt anger, because I couldn\u2019t -- here was my father\u2019s house, that didn\u2019t belong to him any more, that was taken from him, and I wanted to go up to these people and say, this is my heritage. My mother told me, you know, obviously, not to do that, not to bring it up, not even to mention we went to a restaurant to have tea. No one questioned my mother, whether she was Jewish, no one thought about it, and I guess I don\u2019t look that Jewish. It was not imprinted across my forehead. But at the end of the trip was the most interesting part because I sat next to the priest on one of the planes. And I showed -- he said, where do you go to school, and I said I went to BU, and on my I.D. was the Jewish star. And he looked at that, and you could see his eyes were widening, and he turned around, and he said, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

He\u2019ll concede to that, I think, because he\u2019s gone a lot. He does a lot of research, he used to do a lot of moonlighting, more -- only this year he stopped the moonlighting.

Richard. And Michael -- actually we had a little problem with Michael\u2019s name, my mother wanted Frederick, and I just couldn\u2019t see naming my child Frederick. Now, we thought even Forest, they told me they wouldn\u2019t even call him by name if he -- his name was Forest. They call my son, by the way, instead of Dustin, Dodson, on purpose cause they didn\u2019t like the name. But so Michael was actually my idea cause my father has a sister named Malchia, and Fried is Frieda, but it\u2019s spelled a little different. And his Hebrew name is Simcha Meloch, which is actually -- the translation is happy king. And that was their Hebrew names. So it\u2019s interesting in school they dwell a lot on how you got your name. Ev -- almost every year they ask the kids how they got their name, and they\u2019re supposed to write a report about their heritage. And they\u2019re kind of proud. At first Dustin wasn\u2019t proud of Dustin, didn\u2019t like 1t as much. But now they\u2019re -- they\u2019re -- they\u2019re proud of how they got their names.

He\u2019s okay - my husband isn\u2019t a close, warm kind of person, though his mother tries in -- in -- on her behalf, I must admit, her mother tries to keep the family together. His father\u2019s dead. His father was a very kind, gentle man who was a hermit. He would sit on the couch, you have no clue he was there. But he was very fair. You know, when he had something to say he would say it, but he was fair. I get along with his mother, but his mother likes to talk about his mother. I mean, it\u2019s interesting when I go to her house, she\u2019s very nice, she\u2019ll give me care packages, she\u2019!l send things and she tries. But when the kids are there, she doesn\u2019t interact with the kids. That happened with my parents too, cause they didn\u2019t know how to interact with them. And I remember very clearly, Dustin was four years old and told my mother off. I would never dream of telling my mother off, but he told my mother off. She was mad at me that I brought up my son that way, by the way. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.
