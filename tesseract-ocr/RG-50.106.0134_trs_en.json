This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This is the follow-up interview that will focus on Mr. Weiss\u2019s post Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview, I listened to the entire interview you recorded at the Simon Wiesenthal Center on July 28, 1994. I also listened to the first part of the interview you recorded with the Shoah Foundation on September 28, 1998. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that -- in -- in those interviews. Instead, I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences. This is tape number one, side A. What is your name?",
            "answer": "My name is Martin Weiss. I was born in Polana, Ch -- Czechoslovakia on January 28\"29."

And they started a program, they train teachers, the Catholic diocese of the Washington area. And I\u2019ve seen what they did -- what they\u2019re doing in the Catholic schools is just phenomenal. And I -- I feel that when you get it out there, if you got people that cooperate and they educate and they give them exposure that you get these kids that make -- grow up to be anti -- very big anti-Semites, that they get it from education of certain - they get certain information that I may -- they will not get at home, but they get it in the school, like in the Catholic school an -- at that, that each time you in -- you inject people like this with a little knowledge, that sooner or later it helps someplace else as they grow up. You know what\u2019s  even if they have a background of anti-Semitism, they already -- they got it in their own school, through good teachers, which I\u2019ve seen some of them are very, very capable. So this is the kind of stuff, that\u2019s one of the reasons I feel that it\u2019s very important to reach them. And a lot of the kids we get in the museum, many times you think of Jewish kids, actually we get kids from Carolinas, from Oklahoma and from that -- kids that never heard of Jews, or -- or never had any  you know. So this way it gives them, instead of thinking of a Jew as a Jew, they think of Jew as person that went through a bad experience. And -- and maybe some of them will understand some of it.

I -- I like the idea that he was chosen, and I respect him, definitely, because I think he\u2019s a capable guy, not because he\u2019s Jewish necessarily, but he has a certain -- he has a good character. But I think they overplayed a little too much, they made a -- a lot to -- too much to do with -- the press in particular, about him being Jewish. And I think sometimes the Jewish community made a big thing to know about him being Jewish. And I have a think on this that all things considered, that he\u2019s Jewish, we know this and a -- but he is -- more, he is running as a citizen of the United States, not as a Jew, so they shouldn\u2019t make such a big issue of him being Jewish. In other words it shouldn\u2019t be -- like if this was in 1900 and they were making a big to-do about him being Jewish, it\u2019s one thing, but you\u2019re talking about 2000, where I think the citizens should be -- he\u2019s a citizen of the United States. So he -- is he running as a Jew, or 1s he running as a citizen? And I think they\u2019re making too much of it, the fact that he is Jewish. And I have to admit, I have mixed feelings because when Jimmy Carter ran, one thing I didn\u2019t like about him 1s because of his religion, because he was a born again. And I thought that was -- like it clouded his thinking in terms of decision making, or whatever. So I should apply the same thing to hi -- to Lieberman. However, whether it\u2019s my own prejudice or what, I think Lieberman is more based -- how can I put it? Grounded, if you will, and Jimmy Carter was more emotionally born again, but -- where Lieberman is more of a -- has a good character, plus he is jew -- he is Orthodox. So maybe there 1s a difference in how I see it, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
