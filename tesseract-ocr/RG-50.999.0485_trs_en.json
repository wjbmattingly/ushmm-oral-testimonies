If we have time at the end of our program,\nwe'll do questions and answers. In preparation for Manny, we've completed a brief slide\npresentation to introduce his story.\nLet me see -- thank you.\nThis is Manny as a young boy. He was born to a religious Jewish family on May 8,36. Manny was just 3 when World War II started. Although he was born in Riga, Latvia,\nManny's family were Hungarian Jews who moved to Latvia because of his father's work.\nThis is a portrait of Yehuda Mandel and Ella Mandel holding Manny.\nShortly after Manny's birth his father accepted a post as chief cantor in Budapest.\nHungary is indicated on the map. The second indicates Budapest.\nThis photograph shows Manny and his father on the streets in Budapest.\nThe Hungarian government passed anti-Jewish legislation beginning in 1938. And in40, Hungary joined the Axis Alliance with Germany. The war and increasing restrictions\nmade life difficult for Hungarian Jews. Manny's father was conscripted to work periodically in\nHungarian labor battalions.\nHere you see a picture of Manny on the first day of school outside his family's\napartment in Budapest. And on the right is Manny as an adult outside the very same\napartment.\nGerman forces occupied Hungary in March 1944. Manny and his mother Ella were\nfortunate to be included in a program conceived by Germans where Jews would be\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ;\ntransported safely with Palestine in exchange for trucks. Within months they were transported\nby the Nazis to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, near Hannover in\npreparation for their eventual departure from Europe.\nNegotiations for their transport to Palestine broke down and in December 1944. About\nsix months before the end of the war, Manny and his mother were released from\nBergen-Belsen and transported safely to neutral Switzerland. There they stayed at this\nchildren's home where Ella worked as a teacher. Manny is at the bottom left of the image.\nManny, can you join me?\nPlease welcome him to the stage. Thank you.\n[Applause]\nCan everybody hear me? Ok.\nThank you so much, Manny, for joining us today. | know that you were born in \u201835 -\n>> Manny Mandel: \u201836.\n>> Suzy Snyder: \u201836. Your father traveled a lot. Where did he actually do his cantorial\nstudies?\n>> Manny Mandel: If you recall the maps, my father is from eastern Hungary that you know\nbetter as the home of Dracula, Transylvania. My mother is from southern Hungary which you\nknow better as Yugoslavia.\nlt was before the First World War ended. My first started in a small community which\ntoday is called -- it's in Ukraine. He went to school there. Eventually he got to school in\nVienna. Vienna had a major internationally known cantor institute. That's where he got his\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\ntraining. And his first job was in Yugoslavia, where he met my mother.\n>> Suzy Snyder: That was my next question. He met your mother in Yugoslavia. They\nmarried there?\n>> Manny Mandel: In 1930.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Did they return to Budapest? What was the chronology?\n>> Manny Mandel: The chronology has to do with a bit of history. Part of the issue had to do\nwith the fact that my father being born where he was was then a citizen of a country that was\ncreated in 1918, Czechoslovakia. As a Czech national and as a Jew, he had some difficulties\ngetting working papers in Hungary. He could not get a job in Budapest -- could not get working\npapers. A job he could get. Through a various series of what they call auditions he took a\nwell-known job in Riga. In 1936 he was able to get the papers done in Hungary. And that's\nwhen we moved there. We fought for the rest of our lives.\n>> Suzy Snyder: You were born in Riga?\n>> Manny Mandel: Yup. | was just weeks old when they left.\n>> Suzy Snyder: | found it interesting. | read through your father's oral testimony. Maybe you\nhave insight into some of this. But | noticed that in 1937 or 1938 your father actually was\ninvited to London. He interviewed for a job there.\n>> Manny Mandel: Actually, the timing is a bit off. This happened before he got the job in\nBudapest. He interviewed a number of places: Holland, London. He was offered positions,\nbut he was holding out for a position in Budapest. He was still in Riga at the time. So it was a\nbit earlier. When he got the Budapest job, he says: That's it; I've arrived.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Suzy Snyder: Do you know why?\n>> Manny Mandel: He was a native Hungarian, spoke Hungarian. He was part of that whole\nculture. To him this was the peak of all establishments. If you want to be a quarterback in the\ncity, you better play for the Redskins.\n[Laughter]\n>> Suzy Snyder: Ok. So he returned and took the job in Budapest. You were born in \u201836 in\nRiga. You moved to Budapest. You remember going to school in Budapest. Yes?\n>> Manny Mandel: Sure. | remember something before -- [Feedback] You'll recall from the\nnotes, my first experience of the Holocaust was not Budapest. It was no Novi Sad.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Yes, | remember this.\n>> Manny Mandel: Novi Sad is a city in Yugoslavia, down the Danube River. It's my mother's\nhometown. She was not born there but grew up there.\n>> Suzy Snyder: | want to back up for a second though. Is this your first memory, period?\n>> Manny Mandel: | would think so.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Ok. So your first memory actually is in Novi Sad. You can go ahead and\nexplain.\n>> Manny Mandel: Memories, you know, we took vacations on the Adriatic coast. | may\nremember something from that. But first memory that has any significance besides playing in\nthe sand was this experience. It was the first experience of the Holocaust. We went to Novi\nSad to visit my grandparents, my mother's hometown.\n>> Suzy Snyder: In 1941. Right?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\n>> Manny Mandel: Winter \u201841. Stayed with my aunt. My mother had two sisters in Novi Sad.\nStayed in the home of one of them. And one morning somebody comes up and says\nsomething's going on on the street; don't know what it is. Two minutes later two policemen\ncome upstairs, say to us, \u201cPlease dress warmly. You need to be outside. There will be a\ncensus taken.\"\nNow, the Germans, Hungarians, all of the Nazis took censuses every 15 minutes\nbecause they thought if they could know where you are, they could control your whereabouts.\nWe were told to go outside, which we did. We kind of went in, turned left, and began\nto walk for some time. My father carried me. My mother carried me. We were comfortable.\nWe were cold, but it was winter. We had warm coats on, some kind of big boots and things.\nWe marched for a while. This must have been until close to maybe mid-day. Then we wound\nup in a place which | recognized actually. There was on our left a stockade fence. We were\nambling along this fence. Nothing dangerous was happening. Nobody knew why.\nThe fence was the fence that separated the street area, city, from the river. In\nEuropean cities it is not unusual in the summer time if you have no oceans or lakes, the rivers\nbecome the beaches of the community. And this place had a amusement park, restaurants,\nwake pools, cold pools, thermal pools. This was a very nice place. | remember having been\nthere like six months before. My parents lived in the city.\nWe were marching along, kind of slowly. We see that the big gates to this place are\nopen. Folks made a left turn into the gates. As we approached these gates -- | can't tell you if\nit's 100 yards, 50 yards. A policeman standing on the corner says to my father, \"Mister, what\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nare you doing here?\" My father says, \"Visiting my in-laws.\" \"The issue is you are not part of\nthis community. If you and your group is in some way part of the census of this community, it\nwill mess up the census. We cannot mess up. Stand aside.\" Stand aside saved our lives.\nBy coincidence, I'm sure, within minutes of this particular event the staff guard came\ndown the road. These guys had a pow-wow. They got on the bullhorn and said, \"Ladies and\nGentlemen, the requirements of the census have been met. There's a school over there.\nPlease go over there. There's coffee and hot chocolate available. Have some if you wish and\ngo home.\"\nlf you're bewildered, so were we. What we didn't know until sometime later -- | didn't\nknow until a bunch later. | didn't understand even much later than that. Everybody who went\nand turned left was marched to the Danube which had been blasted open from the ice. The\npeople there were shot into the river. They were found the next spring if at all.\nLadies and gentlemen, | describe to you something which you might know as the term\nof Pogrom, a senseless, purposeless, useless, and meaningless exercise in saying | have\npower and you don't. That's exactly what they did.\n>> Suzy Snyder: So this gendarme or this person who pulled you and your family out was\nknowingly saving your lives?\n>> Manny Mandel: | don't know if it was knowingly. He just said it would mess up his\nassignment. They brought in some street policemen from Budapest. He was a street\npoliceman in our neighborhood. Recognized my father from the street. My father lived there.\nWent to work, office, whatever. He saw. He recognized. He says you don't belong here.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\n>> Suzy Snyder: But your mother's family did not suffer during this Pogrom. They were not\nkilled during this Pogrom. Right?\n>> Manny Mandel: The aunt with whom we stayed, her in-laws were killed in her home.\n>> Suzy Snyder: So some of your family was affected.\n>> Manny Mandel: Not the immediate family.\n>> Suzy Snyder: You returned to Budapest.\n>> Manny Mandel: Immediately.\n>> Suzy Snyder: What was it like in Budapest?\n>> Manny Mandel: Life was much more threatened in those days by the war than by the\nHolocaust. As you heard of what Suzy said in the beginning, Hungary was an ally of Germany\naS a consequence was occupied. The Hungarian Nazi Party ruled the day. And I'm not\nsuggesting benevolent, but we did not see SS, didn't see black uniforms. We didn't see all of\nthat which you see in the movies and documentaries. Life was in many ways acceptable. It\nbecame restrictive. You couldn't do this, couldn't do that.\n>> Suzy Snyder: For the Jews.\n>> Manny Mandel: For the Jews, of course. Sorry if | didn't make that point.\nMy uncle was in the university. He was in the last university class where Jews were\nadmitted. But I'm saying the restrictions happen. They did not affect me. As a child of 8, |\nwas protected in the bubble that was created by my mother and father.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Once you returned, what happened to your father?\n>> Manny Mandel: From that time, even a little bit before then, what happened is that the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection P\nHungarian male population was conscripted to the Army. They fought on the Russian front at\none point. So the work that had to be done that could not be done by the Russian male\npopulation was done by a force that was organized by the Hungarians, labor force of Jews.\nThey organized in battalions and regimens. My father would get a phone call, visit or note that\nsays on Tuesday, be at this train station. You will be gone for a day or two or a month or an\nindeterminate period of time. Did this repeatedly from before \u201841 until \u201844 when we left.\n>> Suzy Snyder: And he was still able to practice as a cantor.\n>> Manny Mandel: He had lots of latitude in that they let him be away from work. What else\ncould they do? His job was maintained, salary growing; yes.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Slowly, though, there's still these restrictions on the Jewish population. Your\nfather, have you heard -- did he ever say to you if God wants to punish somebody, then his\nCapacity to see is taken away? Have you ever heard him say that?\n>> Manny Mandel: | must have, but -- would not have said it in Yiddish. Yiddish was never\nthe language of our home. | don't remember that. But I'm sure he said it.\n>> Suzy Snyder: The reason | bring that up is because he said in his oral testimony that he\nfelt that there was this -- that the people didn't really want to believe their restrictions could be\nturned eventually into murder.\n>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely so. No question. They didn't believe it as they were leaving by\ntrain. The problem was -- I'll give you an example which is not specifically mine, but. My\nmother's family name in Yugoslavia was Klein, a Germanic name. Her cousins, her generation\ncousins, changed their names to rip-roaring Hungarian names. Not because they wanted to in\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nsome way avoid their Jewish affiliation. They maintained that. But they felt so Hungarian that\nthey felt they had to have Hungarian names.\n>> Suzy Snyder: They were assimilated into the community.\n>> Manny Mandel: Not to the loss of the Jewishness. Yeah, they all had jobs and what not\nand professions. They wanted to have Hungarian names. They did this. This was something\nthat was peculiar perhaps to Hungary, to Germany. The population did not accept what was\nhappening.\n>> Suzy Snyder: So your father is coming and going between 1941, 1944, around 1944.\nMeanwhile, you're at home with your mother. What are you doing? Are you going to school?\n>> Manny Mandel: Going to school. | went to a local parochial school, Jewish school. First\ngrade and a piece of second grade. I'm 7 in \u201842 or 6 in \u201842 which is when school begins.\nSchool was much of my -- | remember what was then extracurricular stuff which is different\nthan today. | learned fencing and gymnastics in addition to going to school.\n>> Suzy Snyder: And you still had -- you still felt relatively fine, secure, safe, nothing was\ngoing to happen; you personally?\n>> Manny Mandel: As a child, absolutely so. There was a certain element of adventure in all\nof this. When you went to the shelters once, twice a night, five floors down and stayed there -\n>> Suzy Snyder: The bombs.\n>> Manny Mandel: Because of the bombs. You saw the allied bombings from one side, the\nRussians from the other. There's a certain excitement about that to a child who doesn't\nunderstand the danger of it. He only understands it -- this is thrilling in its own odd way, which\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 5\nit was.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Do you gather in retrospect when you look back at your mother had a great\ndeal of anxiety and hid that from you?\n>> Manny Mandel: No question. | would never question that.\n>> Suzy Snyder: She was really successful in maintaining your childhood.\n>> Manny Mandel: As | said to you, | was in a bubble created by my mother and father.\nMostly my mother who was there more than he was. As a consequence, what touched me\nwas filtered. And | could lead the life that | thought was as normal as it could be. My\ncommunity was very small. | don't Know if it would have been bigger if no war took place.\nSomebody walked me to my friend's house unless it was in the same building. But | had\nfriends, had these extracurricular things. | took piano lessons. Life was good as | knew it.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Right. Life continued.\nThe Nazis come in March 1944. How did Hungary change?\n>> Manny Mandel: It began to change -- Eichmann arrives March 19, 1944, as the final step in\nhis cleaning of Europe, of making Europe totally \u201cunden rein,\u201d clean of Jews. That was his\nmission. Prior to that, other things began to be things that | noticed. They didn't impact me\nseverely, but | noticed.\nAn example: Guy says | must take your telephone. What did the telephone -- | don't\nknow if he was home at the time, but somebody said, you know, this is used for their work. He\nsays, I'm sorry, the rule says a law was passed. Bye.\nAll middle class people, Jews and otherwise in Europe, had some kind of maid\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection\nservice; mostly live-in maids. Remember, there was no washing machines, drying machines,\nrefrigerators, freezers, or any of that. So my mother and the maid were these machines. And\nwe had a maid. When the maid was told she had to leave because Jews could no longer have\nmaids, that impacted me very clearly. She was a young woman, 18, 19. | was about 7. She\nwas the closest to me in age. She was from the farm. She was not the most sophisticated\nthing in the whole world, and she was kind of like my buddy of sorts. During the day, morning,\nwhatever. Then she had to leave. All of a sudden, Margit was gone. She was gone.\n>> Suzy Snyder: How did it impact your mother? At this point your mother clearly needs to do\nsomething.\n>> Manny Mandel: The impact on her life, her emotions, what?\n>> Suzy Snyder: Her life, trying to save the two of you.\n>> Manny Mandel: Well, | don't think she had any options to do anything of her own. She's\nthere essentially in what we now call a single mother. My father was gallivanting wherever he\nis, not by choice. She has all of the work to do by herself. And I'm talking about physical work.\n>> Suzy Snyder: What happened with your apartment?\n>> Manny Mandel: We remained. We left from that apartment when we left for the train in44. The apartment was there after the war. My father came back and saw the apartment.\nAnd my granddaughter, who was in Europe a year ago, even less, visited the apartment. It's\nthere. That did not change. We had a very lovely apartment. My school -- my apartment was\nnumber 13 on the street. The school was number 44. From my parents\u2019 bedroom, around the\ncorner of the apartment looking out, they could see the school.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection |\nOne of the changes, I'm told, at times people followed me to school to make sure | get there.\nBecause it was not unusual to have a kid wear a yellow star, which was another change -\n>> Suzy Snyder: Picked off the street.\n>> Manny Mandel: Whacked on the back of the head and left there without any concern. So |\nnever knew this.\n>> Suzy Snyder: You never felt -- there was no anti-Semitism directed towards you by other\nkids?\n>> Manny Mandel: | went to a Jewish school. In the good days of Budapest, 20% of the city\nwas Jewish. It became even 40% a little bit later. Anti-Semitism couldn't rear its head\ninternally. Though, my next door neighbor in the apartments were two girls, very good friends,\ntwo Catholic girls. | did not experience any anti-Semitic remarks from them or their family. |\nremember the father being in the house.\n>> Suzy Snyder: What did your mother do -- at this point, deportations are starting. Jews are\nbeing deported.\n>> Manny Mandel: Not in Budapest.\n>> Suzy Snyder: But there's rumor that they're happening elsewhere.\n>> Manny Mandel: Yes.\n>> Suzy Snyder: And so your mother secures train passage for you and your uncle. Can you\ndescribe what happened?\n>> Manny Mandel: No. No. No. It came the other way. | am sure -- Eichmann arrives in\nBudapest 19th of March, 1944. Within a day or two or three at the top, two men from a\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nso-called self-appointed rescue committee approach Eichmann.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Two Jewish men?\n>> Manny Mandel: Two Jewish men, Rudolf Kastner and Joel Brand -- you need to\nunderstand that Eichmann comes to town as the Caesar of the community. He is the biggest\ndog in town. Anything he wants, he can do. Anybody he wants to kill he can by himself or\nanybody else. These two guys have the guts, the gall, to demand an audience with him.\nDemand.\nAs it happened, Kastner was a lawyer who spoke German. Brand was an engineer\nwho lived in Germany. They talked in German. That was not unusual. They began to discuss\nsome questions about how could there be some kind of arrangements to save some members\nof the community. Because when Eichmann arrives, within hours literally 12,000 people are\ndeported daily. That's when the deportation begins.\n>> Suzy Snyder: To Auschwitz?\n>> Manny Mandel: To places, Auschwitz, other places. Eventually Auschwitz, but sometimes\nnot directly.\nThe discussions begin with the following proposition. If Eichmann will release a million\nJews from the various camps, he will receive for that 10,000 trucks loaded with materiel to be\nused against the Eastern front.\n>> Suzy Snyder: The war effort. Because at this point Germany is starting to suffer during the\nwar effort.\n>> Manny Mandel: They know that they are lost. Everybody there knew they were lost except\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ,\nfor Hitler himself who wouldn't believe it. But the problem is Eichmann does not have a million\npeople under his control anymore. And secondly, these guys couldn't come up with the spare\ntire let alone 10,000 trucks. One of the two is sent to Egypt to talk to the British, the British\nallies to negotiate trucks. The chances of that happening are what we usually call a snowball\nin hell in that there were no trucks available. The British wouldn't give it to them. If | was the\nBritish, | wouldn't give trucks to the Germans.\nAnd as you remember, the opportunities for Jewish populations to be saved in Europe\nwere very low on the whole totem pole in every country. Having said that, these discussions\ncontinued and continued and continued from March until May. And then in June there was a\ndecision made whereby there would be a test group taken of 1,700-some people for significant\namounts of valuables. The European -- this is not money. Money was useless unless you had\ndollars or pound, sterling, British money. Nobody did. But diamonds, jewelry, small pieces of\ngold, nuggets, anything that could be used as a valuable.\nAs you remember, Eichmann is taken by the Israeli secret service in Argentina. He\nfunded his life. So did many of the others through these kinds of -- not to say our money but\nthrough these moneys. By this time the issue goes to Himmler. They're looking to negotiate to\nsave themselves from being war crime eligible and other things. The 1,600 people, 1,700\npeople are collected.\n| think that my uncle was more involved in that than my mother. But my uncle who\nwas active in certain communities in Hungary and my father who was a known human being in\nthe city, they were able to secure these spaces.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\n>> Suzy Snyder: So he didn't look for the first 1,700 people. He put people's names on a list.\n>> Manny Mandel: He was presented with a list.\n>> Suzy Snyder: We've talked about this before. There is this question, -- Kastner happens to\nbe a polarizing figure in the Holocaust because there are people who feel that what he did was\nwrong, playing God. There are people who feel that he didn't have a choice; he saved the\npeople that he could save.\n| don't have an opinion. Well, | have an opinion but it changes all the time, especially\nafter | talk to Manny. Your feeling is more like he had a chance to save 1,700 people.\n>> Manny Mandel: Period. And he did.\n>> Suzy Snyder: And these people were supposed to go to Palestine. You were all supposed\nto go to Palestine.\n>> Manny Mandel: You may be much more familiar with Wallenberg. Wallenberg issued exit\nvisas from Hungary by the thousands, made them Swedish citizens which let them leave.\n>> Suzy Snyder: [Inaudible]\n>> Manny Mandel: Right. Kastner was able to do something else. Most every Jew in\nHungary, to my knowledge, had some kind of interest in the so-called Palestine, in the future\nsometime. My father talked about becoming a farmer, growing orchards with the little\nhorse-drawn buggy when he retires. They used these papers which were given out by the\nJewish National Fund as cantors as documents of having been displaced persons because of\nthe war.\nFolks, if you believe that, | have several $3 I'd like to give you.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection -e\n>> Suzy Snyder: In this case, you and your mother, your uncle, were included on this train.\nAnd this train did not go to Palestine.\n>> Manny Mandel: We were supposed to go to a neutral port, to a place -- on ships to go to\nPalestine. On the way to the neutral port, maybe in Spain, which was a neutral country -- even\nGermany or Turkey -- we were, whatever the word is, kidnapped into a kind of camp which we\nwere told would be a three-day R & R camp before we get on ships. The name was\nBergen-Belsen.\n>> Suzy Snyder: You remember being transported?\n>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely.\n>> Suzy Snyder: What was it like?\n>> Manny Mandel: The transportation to the camp was in cattle cars. Those of you who have\nbeen through the Museum, all the way through, will see them upstairs.\n>> Suzy Snyder: When you got on to cattle cars, do you think she panicked?\n>> Manny Mandel: She was not the panic kind. My recollection is not -- most people didn't.\nAgain, we had no idea -- we were supposed to go to some port to get on a ship. We realized\nthat first class cars were not available. Now, cattle car was well below what we expected but it\nwas a transport means.\n>> Suzy Snyder: How long were you on the cattle car?\n>> Manny Mandel: Nine days. This is July. Weather was warm. In the evening we could\ncome out. They would unlock the doors. We could come out and sleep on the ground.\n| don't really remember -- | remember being in the cars. But there may have been 60 people in\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection g\nthe car. | know there was no place to sit down all day long.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Did people die en route?\n>> Manny Mandel: | don't think so. I'm not aware. I'd have to research that. | don't think so.\nThere's nothing evident.\nWe had some food with us. We were told to pack food. Some. For several days. We\nwere brought food in field kitchens by the military where we stopped. This happened every\nnight until we got to Bergen-Belsen.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Do you remember first arriving in Belsen?\n>> Manny Mandel: It looked like a camp of which | had never been familiar. We had a long\nwalk from the platform of the train station; 20 minutes or so. We carried the luggage. Some\ncame by truck. These were bunk beds; three up. Again, you could see those in the museum.\nAnd there was no impression on me except wonderment as to what the devil is this. | had\nnever seen this before.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Back up for a second. You said you walked from the train station, the\nplatform. It was just a platform, | think, to the camp. So you and | both have been back there.\nIt's miles. It's not a block. You're -- [Inaudible]\n>> Manny Mandel: It was not a three-hour trek.\n>> Suzy Snyder: It wasn't a three-hour trek but you were walking passed village people,\nthrough a village. Did people see you? Did people wonder where you were coming from?\n>> Manny Mandel: | got to tell you, | don't remember seeing people. What | do remember is\nthis particular platform was at the edge of a military installation with brick buildings; in other\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 0\nwords, permanent buildings. And | saw that. And | saw the barbed wire. | don't know whether\nthe villagers at that point, either from Bergen or Belsen were, in fact, lining those streets at that\ntime. If they did, | don't remember.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Do you believe the postwar information that people could not have known\nwhat was going on?\n>> Manny Mandel: No.\n>> Suzy Snyder: You don't believe that to be true?\n>> Manny Mandel: No. Because how can you not know that there is a train traffic that's\nenormous, not remember? Bergen-Belsen is different than others. It was nota killing camp. It\nwas a working camp and a transit camp. People were there and then sent to various places.\nSo the stench of the ovens at least could not be claimed as having not been noticed by the\nlocal population as in Auschwitz.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Let me just clarify that by saying that it was an awful place. When they\nliberated Belsen, people were dying in the hundreds. There was Typhus. There was\ndysentery, starvation. You've heard that.\n>> Manny Mandel: People in Bergen-Belsen did not die in a crematorium. They died, in fact,\nfrom Typhus, from malnutrition, and from starvation, absolutely. And those bodies were there.\nBut | guess that was not -- the community -- this was, as all camps were, they were encircled\nby barbed wire and other things. So the community -- the villagers didn't come. And the fact\nthat they didn't know what was happening at all is something that I'm not willing to believe\nunder any circumstances.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .,\n>> Suzy Snyder: You yourself, you were sick in Bergen-Belsen, were you not?\n>> Manny Mandel: Yup.\n>> Suzy Snyder: How long was it before you became ill?\n>> Manny Mandel: We got there in July. | was probably ill for much of August and September.\nMaybe late in August and through September. There was a better part of six weeks. | had\npneumonia. | did two things in Bergen-Belsen very well. | was sick. | did that very well. And |\nwas bored. | did that very well as well.\nThe problem with the sickness was, as you may know and probably do know, that as\ntoday antibiotics take care of pneumonia. Penicillin had just been invented. | assure you the\nfirst place to be used was not in Bergen-Belsen. So all they could -- we had physicians with\nus. But they had no material or means of helping except old-fashioned medication.\nSomehow they found some burlap material. And somehow they found some mustard.\nWhat they did is they soaked the mustard in water and soaked the burlap bag in mustard. Ok?\nAt which point they draped it over my chest. The outcome that is it acted like Bengay or\nmentholated stuff which made it warm. It didn't cure a damn thing but it made it feel better.\n[Laughter]\n>> Suzy Snyder: How was your mother in the camp? Was she also ill?\n>> Manny Mandel: No. It happens that the barracks arranged, the section next us was the\nwash room. This was a long trench of spigots and basins. The toilets were someplace else.\nMy mother insisted every morning, as long as | could walk out, | would go there with her and\nget washed. If you were clean, you were healthier. | think she was right.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\n>> Suzy Snyder: I've heard this before. Do you feel like she sort of made you go through the\nmotions because she felt like it was important to keep regularity in your life?\n>> Manny Mandel: Oh, absolutely. But that was regularity in my life. But camp itself, and this\nis to me an amazing kind of thing to report, folks -- instead of asking, I'm going to tell you.\nWithin a week or 10 days of the camps' stagement, once the leadership was able to find out\nthat we are here and we're not leaving in three days -- [Inaudible] that much they knew. In\norder to establish some sense of normalcy, some sense of normalcy, businesses opened up. |\nwould think that you would be shocked.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Let me just interrupt for a second. | just wanted to clarify. All 1,700 people\non this train were together?\n>> Manny Mandel: We were sectioned off into a men's section, barracks, into women's\nbarracks and family barracks.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Were you intergrade with other -\n>> Manny Mandel: No, no, no. We were segregated into so-called Hungarian camp. And we\nhad one major, major advantage over all of the others. We were not turned out to work every\nday. Why? Because we were this bartering group. We were either the goose or egg that was\nlaid. If they killed us, they had nothing to barter with. So our total group in this section of the\nBergen-Belsen camp were there all day long. Nobody left. Nobody came.\n>> Suzy Snyder: I'm sorry to interrupt. Continue.\n>> Manny Mandel: What I'm saying is that businesses opened up. What were the\nbusinesses? Well, in the larger sense, in order to maintain some sense of stability and some\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 3\nsense of sanity, you want to do as much of what is normal as it is you possibly can. Well,\npeople couldn't do many things. We bought, for example -- somebody invented a system\nwhereby you could have tin cans -- this is back in Budapest. Tin cans which you could put hot,\ncooked food and have it resealed that would maintain -- it wouldn't spoil, wouldn't become\nrancid for a period of time. Some pressure thing that took all the air out of it and sealed it.\nMost everybody brought some of these tin cans with them as well as other things. The tin\ncans were used for food in addition to what we were given. | can talk about that if you like in a\nminute. But the point is we were given the food. And when the tin cans were emptied, they\ncut them up. They made jewelry out of them, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, rings, and the\nguy who made that would trade for two cigarettes.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Or additional food.\n>> Manny Mandel: Anything you want to think of.\n>> Suzy Snyder: If you had brought the food in, would you have had enough?\n>> Manny Mandel: No. But you would have survived because you could survive without\nhaving enough. So what I'm saying is -- there was a whole kind of a catalog of trades of what\nwas value to what point. Two cigarettes got you a haircut. A haircut got you fixed shoes. |\ndon't remember all of them. My friend Ladsi Loeb who was with us and has written a book\ncatalogues this in his book.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Was this -- had the Germans known you were doing this, they would have -\nit would have -\n>> Manny Mandel: No. They didn't care. Inside the camp. They saw this. All they cared\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection va\nabout -\n>> Suzy Snyder: Not unusual because in a normal camp this would not have gone on.\n>> Manny Mandel: But we were not a normal group in a normal camp.\n>> Suzy Snyder: You had to barter.\n>> Manny Mandel: Yes. They cared about one thing. Obviously no escapes but that we were\nthere for the census every day. When we arrived, we were told at dawn there would be a\ncensus. We would be out there at dawn. The census would come immediately in three or four\nor five hours.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Like roll call.\n>> Manny Mandel: Right. We would be out there for hours until a new commander of the\ncensus group came and says, wait a minute, this is silly. | will be here at X time, 7:00, 8:00. |\nforget when. Be here when I'm here. If you're not, there will be major punishment. Point\nremains be here. But it was easier to come out 15 minutes early than three, four hours early.\nIt probably saved lives.\n>> Suzy Snyder: You're there for six months. You do leave. But in that time, did people pass\naway? Did people die?\n>> Manny Mandel: I'm told that several did. Not because of escapes or shootings or anything\nlike that. They died of what you might call natural causes.\n>> Suzy Snyder: In December 1944, suddenly you're transferred. Can you talk about that?\n>> Manny Mandel: Sure. In August of \u201844, 350 members of this group were, in fact, taken out\nthrough the negotiations. | was not one of them. | stayed for the full load, until December, at\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nwhich point additional negotiations and I'm sure additional moneys and things happened. And\nwe were taken out not by cattle car but, in fact, by German troop trains from Bergen-Belsen\nthrough Austria to the border of Switzerland where we got off the German train and got on\nSwiss trains which were lit and warm and clean and large and hospitable. It was like another\nlife.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Until you hit the Swiss train -- | mean, did you prepare for the worst? Was\nyour mother's feeling that it was another train to nowhere; you had no idea where you were\ngoing?\n>> Manny Mandel: | think they had a fairly good notion that they were being taken -- | mean\nthe leadership was able to say that. How they could guarantee it, | can't tell you. But | think\nthey had a good idea that at this time the trip will be, in fact, to Switzerland, which is where -\nwell, we were never designed to go to Switzerland. Designed to go to a port. At this point |\nthink that was the case. How they would guarantee it, | don't know.\n>> Suzy Snyder: What did you do once you arrived in Switzerland? What was your daily life\nlike?\n>> Manny Mandel: When we arrived, we were under the auspices and some of the control of\nthe Red Cross. The Red Cross had taken a very beautiful hotel in the French part of\nSwitzerland by the city, up in the mountains, and converted into a kind of a shelter for\ndisplaced persons. We were there for several weeks. We were fed a great deal of potatoes.\nNone of us were starving to the point of counting -- though all of us lost weight. They wanted\nto fatten us up a little bit, potatoes and butter and things like that. They had to disperse the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\npeople because were coming in from various places as fast as they could. The people made\narrangements in Zurich, whatever the organization was, was able to take 20 children, all\nHungarian-speaking kids, and take them to a children's boarding school in the German part of\nSwitzerland, a place called Heiden. And | went there with 19 other kids.\nBy peculiar coincidence, again, guess who was the caretaker, teacher, and everything\nelse? My mother. Why? My mother had been a teacher when she was a young woman.\nThey decided they needed somebody to go with these kids who spoke Hungarian only. My\nmother obviously spoke Hungarian, but she also spoke very good German, had a good\nknowledge of French.\nThe kids there were German and Belgian kids. The staff were German, Belgian,\nFrench. They were able to communicate and to in some way be the interlocutor needed. Also,\nshe ran the school. The kids were from age 6 to 14. She ran the school for each two kids |\nthink. But that was there. So there as the teacher's kid, it's either the best of your possible life\nor the worst. If anything happened that shouldn't happen, | was blamed.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Which was it?\n>> Manny Mandel: Depending which day.\n[Laughter]\n>> Suzy Snyder: Meanwhile, the communication between your father -- you and your father,\nit's non-existent.\n>> Manny Mandel: Correct. My father comes back to Budapest before the war ends, before\nthe Russians liberated Budapest. He's looking around. He goes to this man, Dr. Kastner, the\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nlawyer, and says: Where is the group? Where is my family?\n>> Suzy Snyder: Kastner did not travel with the train?\n>> Manny Mandel: Did not. His family did.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Remained in Budapest?\n>> Manny Mandel: Everywhere else. He was in Switzerland when we got off the German\ntrain, stayed a day or two and then went on to his other assignments.\nLet me digress one more moment. Kastner was a very bright, incredibly arrogant guy.\nThere was a film made about his killing later in Israel. There was a premiere of that movie in\nNew York. | went to the premiere. \"The New York Times\" correspondent, journalist, asked me\nabout him. | said | never met the man. | was a child. He had no business with kids. But my\nfather did. Based on that description, | think | would not have liked him as a human being.\nRespected what he did, but this was not a guy | wanted to have as a friend. But what he did\nwas something that no one else did. | mean, Schindler did something similar, but this is more\nthan Schindler. It's the only Jew that did anything. And there was nothing for him to gain out\nof this whole issue. That's not just an opinion; it's a fact.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Ok. | just would say that during this digression, | would like to point out that\nwhat he gains is that he and his family survived.\n>> Manny Mandel: Would you have an option that says -- [Inaudible]\n>> Suzy Snyder: Absolutely.\n>> Manny Mandel: That gain he has. But nothing personal in terms of anything.\n>> Suzy Snyder: So | just wanted to say that this is why | can't have an opinion because |\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\ndon't know what | would have done. He did save your family's life.\n>> Manny Mandel: | want to finish that thought by saying to you, you see what happens later\non is he's accused of being a collaborator of the Germans having benefited from that\ncollaboration. And that's what | disagree with.\n>> Suzy Snyder: But he was found innocent.\n>> Manny Mandel: He was never tried.\n>> Suzy Snyder: There was a trial in Israel in which there was a libel suit that he brought.\n>> Manny Mandel: A libel suit won.\n>> Suzy Snyder: He was found that he was not libel, that it was not libel.\n>> Manny Mandel: Suzy, the guy who wrote the pamphlet, the pamphlet -- writes a pamphlet\nsaying | accuse Kastner of being a collaborator.\n>> Suzy Snyder: And Kastner brings charges.\n>> Manny Mandel: He's a government employee. The government has to protect his workers\nso they sue the pamphleteer who is found innocent. In the course of the trial there's such\nnoise about Kastner's involvement in the war, with Eichmann, with the others, he testified on\nbehalf of Becher in Nuremberg -\n>> Suzy Snyder: Becher.\n>> Manny Mandel: A German officer. The point was made that he helped the Nazis in some\nway. There's much to be said about that; not here because we don't have time.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Right.\n>> Manny Mandel: Kastner was a person who | don't think | would like as a personal friend.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection +0\nBut he had to be that kind of a person to do what he did. How else could you do it?\n>> Suzy Snyder: Right. We're really getting into nitty-gritty that we should get away from so\nwe can get back to your story, but -- and we can bring that up later if we have time in the\nquestions and answers. Your father did go to his office.\n>> Manny Mandel: My father went to his office, found out after some difficulties which I'm not\ngoing to elaborate on, found out where we were. And my father was able to make contact with\nanother cantor who was a colleague of his.\nIn those days cell phones didn't work very well. But you could have -- telephones\ndidn't work very well, there was a war going on. The war was over, but still.\nThe war was still on when this is taking place. We're in Switzerland but my father is\nable to be in contact with my mother through his colleague, a cantor. They correspond. When\nthe war is over, my mother decides she wants to continue south to Palestine. My father says\nyou can come back to Hungary, the apartment is there. | have a job. My mother says | will\nnever step foot -- [No audio]\n>> Suzy Snyder: When did you arrive in Palestine?\n>> Manny Mandel: September \u201845.\n>> Suzy Snyder: What was your impression when you first saw it? | mean, you know, it was a\ndesert.\n>> Manny Mandel: No.\n>> Suzy Snyder: It was rough.\n>> Manny Mandel: | lived in one of the nicest in the whole country. All | knew is my group.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nOak was the name of the group; 20 kids, boys and girls. That was the fourth grade class.\nGroups were by class. And the surroundings were lovely. There were gardens. There were\nnot forests but orchards and others. It's a farming. It also had some dairy, milk.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Did you find at all it was a hard transition from Budapest having lived in\nBudapest, a European city?\n>> Manny Mandel: Suzy, within a year or so you've gone through several languages, several\ncountries, adjustments become much easier. | went from Budapest to Bergen-Belsen to\nHeiden to Palestine.\n>> Suzy Snyder: How long were you in Palestine?\n>> Manny Mandel: Four years.\n>> Suzy Snyder: You moved again.\n>> Manny Mandel: We left Budapest after a year. They chose to come to the states through\nvarious arrangements in 1949. | lived in New York for a year. | lived in Philadelphia for the\nrest of my days until | left Philadelphia in 1961.\n>> Suzy Snyder: | know your father ended up -- he was a cantor here.\n>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely.\n>> Suzy Snyder: What did your mother do?\n>> Manny Mandel: She was a housekeeper, a housewife. She was a non-working mother,\nhelped my father. Raised me.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Do you think they liked it here and adjusted well to living in the United\nStates?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\n>> Manny Mandel: | think so, very much so. Very much so. Yeah. No reason -- my father\nchose to stay here because he could. He had some family here. He had really very little\nfamily in Israel. Some came after we left. But! think he made his niche here and it was very\ncomfortable.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Your father sounds like a strong person, but reading the transcripts of your\noral history, your father's, it sounds like your mother was extremely strong, was an amazing\nwoman.\n>> Manny Mandel: My son is here in the audience. | wish he could talk about it because he\ndoesn't remember her. She died at the age of 59 unfortunately for unrelated issues. But he\nknew my father very well. But point is, my mother was a very strong woman; yes. So was my\nfather. She had a very good life together for 37 years until she died. The only thing they ever\nargued about was me.\n[Laughter]\n>> Suzy Snyder: | wanted to open it up to questions. We have quite a bit of time for\nquestions. Please wait until we have a microphone because we're recording this.\nRaise your hand. Nobody has question?\nComplicated story. There must be.\n>> | visited the synagogue in Budapest, downtown, beautiful, giant synagogue. Is that where\nyour father was the cantor?\n>> Manny Mandel: What shape was it in?\n>> This was in \u201898. It was in excellent condition.\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\n>> Manny Mandel: That's the other. There are two major synagogues in Budapest. My father\nfunctioned in that synagogue as well but his major, permanent position, was two blocks away.\nThe synagogue was not reconstructed after the war. The one that you saw was reconstructed\nand most recently was refurbished as well because of some construction things they had to do\nby the Emanuel Schwartz Foundation. Did you ever hear of it? Well, Emanuel Schwartz was\na tailor in Brooklyn. He had a son who was better known, Tony Curtis. They were involved in\nrefurbishing that. That Tony Curtis.\n>> Suzy Snyder: A question up here in front. You can ask.\n>> Can you clarify when you took the walk to the river? The gentleman said he recognized\npart of the family. You said everybody else took a left. How did your immediate family get\nsaved?\n>> Suzy Snyder: In Novi Sad -- this gentleman is asking for a clarification. In Novi Sad in41 when they had -- when there was a census, they had to walk along the river.\n>> Manny Mandel: The Pogrom.\n>> Suzy Snyder: The Pogrom. Manny's family was not part of it. They were rescued by this\nman. Can you clarify?\n>> Manny Mandel: We were marching along, and people in front of us, | don't know, 20, 30\npeople, whatever, made this left turn. They were the ones never seen again. At our point in\nthis group of probably a dozen people by this time, this policeman says you don't belong here,\nstep aside. Coincidental to that, within minutes, by coincidence, I'm sure, the whole Pogrom\nwas halted. The guy comes and announces -- nothing to do with us specifically -- announces\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nthat the requirements of the census had been met, please go get coffee and go home. But\neverybody from us back, not only us, a little before us and back, were, in fact, no longer in\ndanger. He recognized my father from having seen him walk on the street.\nDoes that clarify?\n>> Yeah.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Go ahead.\n>> Just doing research on the Holocaust in general, \u201cThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas,\u201d they\nstrip you down, give you these uniforms and give you the number on your wrist. Did you have\nto do that, anything like that?\n>> Manny Mandel: Please understand, folks -- I'll speak into it.\nYou have to understand, please, that the issues of the Holocaust, issues of the war,\nthe issues of different countries made this into a very, very multi-facetted story. Everybody did\nnot get uniforms; everybody was not tattooed. Nobody in Bergen-Belsen got a uniform unless\nthey went out to work, and we didn't. Nobody was tattooed except at Auschwitz and only if\nthey went to work. A number across the chest. They had a number on the arm. Sono\nsurvivors who were in Auschwitz who have tattoos. So there were various kinds of differences.\nIn our situation | tried to make the point that to our fortune we had a situation whereby\nwe were a special group because we were the barter. We were the valuables that could not\nbe destroyed because then the valuables could no longer be milked for the money to generate\naround the world. So we were worthless but our presence was important.\n>> Suzy Snyder: | just want to clarify, in Bergen-Belsen people did arrive in striped uniforms\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nbut usually from other camps. Often from other camps. They were deported usually to\nAuschwitz and then transported to Bergen-Belsen.\n>> Manny Mandel: You know the story of Anne Frank who, in fact, was deported to -- then to\nAuschwitz and then to Bergen-Belsen and died there. Anne Frank came to Bergen-Belsen in\nAugust of 1944. | came in July. | left in December. She died in April, two or three weeks\nbefore the camp was liberated. In some way | have an odd kinship with her because for four\nmonths we breathed the same air. But that's how people move from place to place.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Yeah?\n>> [Question Inaudible]\n>> Suzy Snyder: The question was -- can you talk a little bit more about the bartering, the idea\nof bartering people for trucks or for goods?\nThis was a manner in which the Jewish community -- because they had advanced\nnotice from Jews who had escaped from Auschwitz that Jews were being killed in Auschwitz.\nAnd the Slovakian-Jewish community was informed of this. Eichmann and Kastner sat down\nafter the fact, after this, became known. And this was part of the thing. Kastner's goal was\nstrictly to use bartering to save lives.\n>> Manny Mandel: And Eichmann's goal was to use bartering to save his life in some ways.\nAs | say, Eichmann and Dr. Mengele and others wind up in South America which is where the\nphilosophy was accepting of whatever they did. They were neutral. Neutral militarily, not\nphilosophically. If you think of South America in those days, Argentina, it is a country that is\nfascist in its own way. They accepted these guys. They could feather their own nest. And\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .\nthey could in some way make a life for themselves. By this time everybody was -- all the rats\nwere running out of the place any which way they could. If they had an opportunity to have\nthat funded in some way, they did it. There's nothing noble about it.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Yeah.\n>> [Question Inaudible]\n>> Suzy Snyder: Was there actually an exchange of people for stuff for the war effort?\n>> Manny Mandel: The original concept in the language they used was [Speaking language\nother than English]. Blood for materiel. The materiel became strictly only negotiable kinds of\nvaluables: diamonds, gold, and so forth. No trucks. As | said, they could not raise a spare\ntire; not 10,000 trucks.\n>> [Inaudible]\n>> Suzy Snyder: Collaborators? So the second question was: Who did the killing in 1941?\nWere they German Nazis or collaborators?\n>> Manny Mandel: They were not collaborators nor Naz -- they were Nazis, yes. They were\nnot the SS, not the German uniformed Nazis but the local Yugoslav and Hungarian troops as\nwell as some of the collaborating -- the Chetniks -- not -- I'm blocking on a word. The local\ncommunity people who were sympathetic to the Nazi group. It was done locally. It was not the\nonly one. There were many.\n>> Suzy Snyder: And in Hungary it was the Arrow Cross.\n>> Manny Mandel: The Arrow Cross is the name of the Nazi Party in Hungary.\n>> Suzy Snyder: They were generally -- so in each country you have people that are sort of -\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection x\nthey're doing the dirty work for the Nazis, essentially.\n>> [Inaudible]\n>> Manny Mandel: Some of Yugoslavia is -- absolutely. Croatia is under German control.\nSerbia is not all of it because southern Hungary. But they were not in Hungary. That's the\nimportant point for us. Not only invaded, not taken over. Austria, yes. France, yes. So forth\nand so on.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Right. And Czechoslovakia.\n>> Manny Mandel: Right.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Yeah?\n>> [Question Inaudible]\n>> Manny Mandel: Honestly, they count enough people.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Manny said the needs of the census were met. What needs were met?\n>> Manny Mandel: As | said, | don't know what the needs were in the first place. They count\nenough people or they count enough sections of the city that produced the people to know how\nmany men, women, children, whatever there were. Whatever they were looking for.\nRemember, there was no census involved in this. This was a Pogrom collecting\npeople. The ruse was we have to have a census so come outside. But the fact is what\nhappened is march us to death except we didn't quite get there. Ok?\n>> Suzy Snyder: One more question. Yes?\n>> When your family was pulled aside, at what point -- how did that affect your life?\n>> Suzy Snyder: Let me repeat. When your family was pulled aside, at that moment when did\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection 7\nManny or Manny's family realize that their lives were saved, that the other people were being\nkilled? I'm throwing that part in because | gather that -- go ahead and answer the question.\n>> Manny Mandel: | had no idea whatsoever as to what was happening. /-year-old kids were\nnot privy to some of this stuff nor could they understand it. And | would not be surprised if my\nparents decided to just hold it back. They found out that night. My aunt\u2019s in-laws were killed.\nThey found out through telephone conversations and what not what was going on, which is\nwhy my father the next morning ordered the taxi at 6:00 in the morning, which | thought was\nanother adventure. This was a one-horse power taxi. You ever hear of one? It was winter.\nThere was snow. The taxi was a sleigh. One horse.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Was this the last time you saw your mother's family?\n>> Manny Mandel: No. We saw them subsequently in Budapest. The point is it -- go ahead.\n>> Suzy Snyder: No. Go ahead.\n>> Manny Mandel: We were talking about when | found out. | don't know when | found out. |\ncertainly learned about this particular Pogrom later on, year, two, or three. The understanding\nof its meaning, | don't know. | can't give you a time as to on Tuesday | understood what was\nhappening. | began to understand there were people being killed in various places. And this\nwas the first experience | had with it. Almost.\n>> Suzy Snyder: It's our tradition to let Manny have the last word. I'm going to let him do that.\nThen what | would ask you to do is if you could, once Manny is done, if you could please just\nrise in your seats and stay standing so that Miriam can take a picture of Manny with you as the\nbackdrop. Ok?\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\nContact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection ne\nManny?\n>> Manny Mandel: | often, maybe all the time, when | make talks of this nature, here or\nelsewhere, | talk about a person whose name you don't remember but his words you do\nremember. | will leave that with you.\nA man said those who do not learn the history well may be doomed to repeat it or\nrepeat parts of it. The man's name was George Santayana, 120 years ago. Point is not so\nmuch that you need to be concerned there's going to be a Holocaust here next week. But\nthere are other kinds of things that we do to each other. What man does to man is\nindescribable. Those are not my own words. They were spoken by then General Eisenhower.\nThe point I'm making is that | would beseech you and leave the last word with you to\nsee to it that by being here this is not the last nor the first of your experience in learning about\nwhat man does to man: Holocaust, Second World War, why these, why those, and why not.\nThat's the only way you're going to know what to do in that we can learn nothing from the\nfuture but we can learn from the past which you can apply in the future.\n| thank you.\n>> Suzy Snyder: Thank you.\n[Applause]\n[The First Person event ended at 12:05 p.m.]\nROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT\nNOT A VERBATIM RECORD\n",
