girl scout, we had to go there. And they picked us, there were 30 kids at least. And they put us
all in the bus and drove us there. And then we were standing in line and Hitler was on the
podium, talking. And they picked me out because I had blue eyes, blond, I had ponytails. I
looked like a typical German girl. That’s the only thing I can explain that. And then he gave,
they gave me flowers and I had to go up on the podium and bring Hitler the flowers. And he
hugged and kissed me. And then I felt a real part of it. It was an honor to do that. I didn’t know
what, what future lie ahead of me. So then I told all my classmates, I gave Hitler flowers and just
bragged about it you know.

had to go hungry.

open the door. They just stormed into, into the house. There was three Nazi guys and they took
the Jewish people out. We were, our house were on a bank of a street, the driveway was right in
front of our house. They lined the Jewish people up on one side and they lined us up on the other
side. In nightgowns. That’s why it was summer, it wasn’t cold. And they took a machine gun
and they killed the Jewish people. Right there in front of us. We were not, not supposed to cry or
help them. They said if you get out of line, you get shot. So we all stood frozen in one line.
And then the one guy took a pistol, held to my mom and said I shoot you. And my mom said
Jesus help me. And the guy dropped his gun. I don’t know why he dropped the gun, but he
dropped it. And he couldn’t shoot it anymore. And then he went, my father said if you want to

shoot anybody you have to shoot me because I’m the one who got the Jewish people in our
house. So they shot him. They shot him right in front of us. We couldn’t say anything, we
couldn’t cry, we couldn’t do nothing. Otherwise we would have been killed too. And then the
whistle go up, one guy put a whistle in his mouth. The whistle go off. A truck came and they all
had to go on the truck. Except my mom. My mom had to stay there and she went in the air raid
shelter as a Red Cross nurse. She stayed there for four years. And we had to go. They drove us
at farms. We had to do farm labor like child labor. At ten years you had to milk five cows in the
morning, learn how to drive a tractor. How to plow with horses. We did that all at ten years old.
First I cried. I was miserable. And then I got used to it. And but while we were driving out they
put gasoline on your house, they put your house on fire. So we lost everything. My mom had to
find a room somewhere. And we were at these farms. We are all separated. They put us on four
different farms. And that now a big truck we went. And you couldn’t escape. There was
nowhere to escape. So we stayed there and I was there for four years. And I got confirmed there
you know. So I learned the good work ethic. That’s where I did learn. You know somebody said
you have to go to work 5:00, I would be there 5:00. That’s what I did learn. So then after the
war, my mom got a taxi. She went to it’s called the Bergersmeister office. You know who the
Bergermeister is. Bergersmeister office. They had all the papers and she found out there
where we were. And she went in this taxi and picked us all up. No warning. AIl of a sudden she
was standing there. You know and I was super glad that I saw her again. And she took around
and picked up all my sisters. My brother had run away. And my parents said he went to the
Heights MB [ph], to American Legion. And we have never heard from him again. He went
there and he disappeared. So he wanted no part of this. So we don’t know where he went. I
have looked on the internet, trying to find him but I can’t find him. He might be dead also, cause

thing happen and you saw German soldiers on the street, Nazi soldiers, what was your feeling.
Did you think they were impressive?
A: No we were afraid of them.
Q: Why? How did you know to be afraid of them?
A: Because they all had guns. They had their machine guns, pistols and we knew something bad
would happen.
Q: Did you ever see them mistreat anybody in the street?

Q: So you actually saw dead bodies?
A: Yeah. We had to climb over them because we had to go to school.
Q: Did you talk about this with your parents?
A: We said something. That’s none of your business. Keep your mouth shut. Nobody could say
anything. If you would say something and it came out, you would get in trouble. That’s how
Germany got ruled. If you say anything bad they would come. They picked ministers off the
pulpit and the minister was saying they were picking out all the girl scouts, out of the church.
They picked me out too. And we were still on the way out that the minister said that is wrong
what you are doing. Leave those kids in here. They are better with God as with you. They took
him off the pulpit and shot him. Right in front of the whole congregation.
Q: Did you yourself ever witness that?

anything in girl scouts, they came and they taught us how to march and how to shoot with guns. I
was with ten years, before ten years. I was a marksman. I could shoot anything. But that’s what
they taught you. They wanted the kids to be prepared for the army. And —
Q: How long did you stay in that scout —
A: Two years. No, yeah two years.
Q: Were you a member of that group when the Germans came to your house? Were you still a
member at that time?

them. That was his main business, making boots for the army.
Q: Did he talk about that with you? Did it bother him terribly to have to do that?
A: Was a living, was a living. He had to support us. So (pause)

time and they said the Americans sent them. The potato bugs and we had to collect them, we
had to find them.
Q: To pick off the potato bugs.
A: Yeah in school time. I would sit there, in school times and they took away from learning.
And I didn’t learn a lot. Because I was so tired. Most of the time I fell asleep, because I had to
get up 5:00 in the morning and work. And 8:00, 9:00 the school started.

Interview with Edith Langer 33
A: I learned to, I had a trade. I wanted well I wanted to be a baker because I always had food.
That was my doing. I always had something to eat. And I didn’t enjoy it very much first.
Because you had to do all the dirty work first. We had to clean the bakery, wash the dishes, and
do stuff like that. So I didn’t enjoy that, that much. But then after two years I begin to like it.
Because it was artistic. You could do flours and learn that you know. And then I did first, I did
cooking. The first two years, I forgot that. I did cooking. I wanted to be a chef first. And then
the third year we had to do baking and I liked that better. So I took baking up for three more
years. So I put myself five years through training. At 50 cents a week, I remember that. No, no
other money. So but I learned, I learned at least how to bake. And then I went, I got my casen

date with me. And the minister gave me ten cents that night. He said keep the ten cents and call
me if you get in trouble and I pick you up wherever you are. And Gerhard stupid of him, he went
to a motel. He opened the door. I didn’t know what a motel was. In Germany you didn’t have
motels. So he opened the door and I saw two beds in there. And I pushed him inside the room,
locked the door. I still had the key, locked the door and went to the office and called Mr.
Dakand. And I said I am in trouble. Can you get me. I told him where I was. He knew the

I finally left. And I worked in another bakery in Flemington. And there I had to prove myself.
They didn’t want any women bakers. Women bakers didn’t exist here for a while. So I had to
work for one week and I made cookies and doughnuts and breads. After one week they said
yeah, you have ajob. So I stayed there. I only worked there for a half a year. But I did, I baby
sat a family at night. And they have moved here to Maryland. That’s how I got to Maryland.
And they moved to Maryland and they said well we want you to baby sit our kids again. And
you can stay in our house. We’re building a house. They built a house but one short, one
bedroom was short. I had to live with the daughter in one bedroom. And that’s what I didn’t
want to do. So I went to a bakery in Ellicott City, Frederick’s or whatever it’s called. I went
there, they are out of business now. But I went there and I, there in the bakery and I had to ice,
ice cakes. Wedding cakes and birthday cakes. And the girl, who decorated them was sick one
day. For the whole week. And I had to decorate the cakes. And the people came and said after,
even after she came back, we want Edith’s cakes. So we had the clash there. So I left. I then
opened my own bakery. In Aras Anna in Baltimore. And it was a laundry and I cleaned it all
out and I put a bakery in there and but I couldn’t get any help. Help to, for me. I think I am
perfectionist. So I didn’t, I closed the door and I worked for fifteen years in, called Edelweiss

collection interview with Edith Langer. This is track number two. When you were here in the
United States and people asked you about where you came from, or did many people ask you. Or
did they discuss about Hitler or about the Nazis or about the Jews, did people bring those topics
up when you came to the United States.
Edith Langer: Yeah.
Q: How did you respond?
A: I told them how it really was. Many people did not know that Hitler went at the small
families like at the families like me and they said Hitler couldn’t be that bad. But I told them
then and then the, history books they only say that he killed many Jews and put them, put them
in concentration camps. And I knew that but then I told them my story and I have told to many
people my story. They all would say ah but how, because I told it in churches. My story. I told
it to youth groups. I went to, all over telling the story about how Hitler really was. And it wasn’t
I still think in my heart it wasn’t Hitler’s doing. It was the Nazis’ doing you know.

Interview with Edith Langer 40
Q: He didn’t do the actual physical killing is what you’re saying.
A: No.
Q: He gave the orders to do it.
A: Yeah. He gave the orders because the Nazis had the orders to kill people who said something
bad about Hitler or I have heard people saying well Hitler is no good. Next day they would, you
found them dead. You know. And that doesn’t work. So I told those stories to churches,
Methodist church in New York. I spoke many times there. I had a youth group there. I was a
choir director for a long time. And I told them where I was coming from.
Q: Did you meet many Jewish people after the war in the United States? Did you have Jewish
customers or Jewish friends?
A: To be honest with you, I hated Jews.
Q: Because.
A: Because they were, they were causing us, my dad to be killed. If he wouldn’t have hidden
them he would still live. So I had to get over that. I went to counseling for it. And the
counselors straightened me out. There would have been another family who would had got them.

in Germany in the schools, whether they’re teaching it correctly and they’re doing enough, not
enough?
A: I don’t think it’s done enough. Like my own story has never been told in Germany. And the
people should have known that. And I think that the SS should have been accountable for what
they did. They had all the number on their shoulder so they should catch them more.
Q: You’re talking about the members of the Nazi Party?
A: Yeah.
Q: They should have all been held accountable.

A: She is younger than Iam. She might be not. But she only heard bits and pieces. She never
heard, I never told her the whole story. Because she is German and after the war, everybody said
that all Germans killed the Jews. That’s everybody and that’s not so. I never killed anybody.
And Gabby didn’t kill anybody so most of the Germans did not kill the Jews. There were a few
soldiers who killed but you can’t get everybody in one cannot, that they all killed the Jews.
Q: Did you hear of any other situations where Jews were being sheltered like your father
sheltered those four.
A: No.
Q: As far as you know, he was the only one.
A: That was kept a total secret. When you had Jewish people you were quiet about it.

Q: Stupidity? Because?
A: Why did he have to say shoot me? That wasn’t brave in my eyes. That was plain stupidity.
Q: What I was asking was, before that, what do you attribute the fact that he went to these people
and offered them the basement?
A: Kindness. He wanted, he must have known that the Jewish people got killed somehow.
Q: Do you consider that a brave act on his part, that he sheltered?
A: That was, but that was brave. That was brave but the way he confessed it and said shoot me.
He should have kept his stupid mouth shut. Then he would still be living. I don’t know whether
they would still be living. He’s older but —
Q: You think the Nazi soldiers would have left him alone if he hadn’t said anything, even though
they knew the Jews were in his basement?
A: They weren’t ready to, he wasn’t ready to kill him because he dropped his gun by my mom.
So he probably —
