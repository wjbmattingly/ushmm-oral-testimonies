Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Mr. Ralph Hockley on January 12, 2016, in Carrollton, Texas. Thank you very
much Mr. Hockley, for agreeing to speak with us today. We’re going to conduct a
long interview, trying to capture as many of your experiences as we can, in different
places, and a — in different times. And we’|I start at the very beginning. We’ll ask the
most basic questions, and from there we develop our story. So the very first question
I have for you, can you tell me your date of birth?
Answer: October 17, 1925.
Q: And what was your name at birth?
A: Rudolf with an F, Martin Hockenheimer.
Q: Hockenheimer. And where were you born?
A: In Karlsruhe, Germany.
Q: Can you tell me ge — a little bit, just geographically, approximately where is
Karlsruhe in Germany? What are other major places near it?
A: It’s —1t’s southwest Germany, it’s a cr — just across the river from France. It’s
where the line separates Germany and France, and then the border turns west — the
German border turns west. It’s 45 minutes north of Strasbourg, France, and it’s due
west of Stuttgart, and due south of Heidelberg and Mannheim.
Q: Okay. So could you call it a border town, a border city?

A: You could, but it was more involved in the traffic of boats on the Rhine river.
Q: Ah, okay, okay.
A: It’s actually called — it used to be, I suspect it still is, Karlsruhe am Rhine.
Q: Okay.
A: It’s —it’s right — it has a big harbor for [indecipherable] shipping.
Q: Okay. And how is it that you happen to be born in Karlsruhe?
A: My -
Q: I— were your fam — the —
A: My parents — my parents — my mother was from Munich.
Q: Okay.
A: And my father was originally from Hockenheim —
Q: Okay.
A: — which 1s — was a cigar town. And then, that is close to Mannheim, so he grew
up in Mannheim.
Q: Okay.
A: And for professional reasons, he came to Karlsruhe and joined his brother-in-
law in a business in [speaks German]
Q: Okay, what is that?
A: That is they — they sold machines for butchers. They sold everything the butchers
needed, including sausage casings, because in those days, all sausages were still

made with casings. And so that was a big business, and the — his — his store was right
across the street from the slaughterhouse.
Q: So your father’s store — your — your father’s store was across the street from —
that’s pretty convenient.
A: Yeah.
Q: You know. Okay, I mean, when I asked that question, yes, it was sort of a
backwards question to ask, is your family from Karlsruhe. And —
A: The answer is no.
Q: Yeah.
A: The answer is, my mother’s family is from Munich, but that’s got a lot of ifs to
it, too. My father’s family is definitely from Baden, from the Hockenheim,
Mannheim, Heidelberg area. Ma — the reason I say with my mother is, because the
— her mother was from Mannheim, and she married a gentleman who came from a
place called Buttenhausen.
Q: Buttenhausen’?
A: Yeah.
Q: Never heard of it.
A: Nobody else has either. It’s a — it’s kind of between Stuttgart and Nuremberg.
Q: Okay.

January 12, 2016
A: There’s a whole big area in there, but that — that’s where her father came from.
And the thing that’s very confusing, if you look at the — the family tree, or anything
else, is that my grandmother, whose maiden name — well, my mother’s maiden name
was Lowenthal(ph) — Lowenthal.
Q: Mm-hm, Lowenthal.
A: And her mother — her father was Hermann(ph) Lowenthal, and her mother was
also a Lowenthal, but they were not related. And so that gets very confusing —
Q: Yes.
A: — when you look at the — at the family trees, because you don’t know which ler —
Lowenthal you’ re talking about. But they had nothing in common.
Q: Did you do that? Did you research your family tree, at some point?
A: Yeah. Yes.
Q: And ki — how fa — ka — what can you tell us about that, what you discovered?
How far back did your family go in — in Germany? How — how far back could you
discover?
A: Well, my father’s family, the Hockenheimers, I’ve been working on all week, to
make it into some form that I can give you a copy. My father’s family I traced back
to about 1789, and my mother’s family, I would say the 1850s.
Q: Okay. So that’s how far back you were able to find, and they were all still in these
areas for several generations.

Interview with Ralph Hockley '
January 12, 2016
A: Yeah, what happened, the one thing that you notice when you do that, is that in
the 19 —I’m sorry, in the 1890s, the Jewish people moved from the villages into the
cities. So that was a big change there. They all were born in small towns, but they all
wound up in big cities. And that had to do with the government attitude, and so on.
They — there are a lot of little things you find out, you — for example, until the 1850
— 60s, children had Jewish first names. Starting about ’70 — 1870, they all had very
German names.
Q: Really?
A: My father’s brothers were Albert, Louie. The youngest one was Fritz, heaven
forbid, and my father was Julius —
Q: Yeah.
A: — and they all had the German names. The German Jews, it’s a big thing that
comes out of this, wanted to be Germans. A lot of them were very religious, some of
them weren’t, but they all wanted to be accepted, which was a — the key to this
whole thing.
Q: Yeah.
A: They wanted — they finally wanted to be accepted.
Q: And so, were you able to find — if you — there was Fritz and Ira and Julius, what
about their father, what was his name? Did you remember?

January 12, 2016
A: Well, yes. My father’s father’s name — he was born in 1844 1-in Hockenheim, his
name was Maier, m-a-i-e-r. There are two versions. It could be m-e-y-e-r, but he-he
was m-a-i-e-r, and his father was Isaac, with two As.
Q: Well, you know that’s very — that’s interesting, because in eastern Europe, in
Poland, you would still find people of your father’s generation with Jewish names,
rather than let’s say, with a Polish version, or in Hungary, a Hungarian version.
They would still be those old names, which sol — which kind of suggests the
assimilation hadn’t happened.
A: Yeah, it wi — yeah, the — unfortunately, I have to say that the German Jews felt
very uppity about east European Jews, and the — and I don’t — the older I get, the less
I understand it, because I find out in looking at the family tree, that, for example —
well, that f — the one thing that complicates everything is that because of all the wars
over there, the — they — the people changed citizenship any time. I mean, they didn’t
know who was running what part of the [indecipherable]. On my — on my wife’s —
my late wife’s family, her name was Frankel, and her paternal family, ther — her
father was born in a place called Drohobych, in — in —
Q: Oh yes, in Poland, isn’t it?
A: Well, depends when you’re talking about it.
Q: That’s true, that’s true.

Interview with Ralph Hockley ”
January 12, 2016
A: When he was born, it was Poland. In, I think from 1871, after the Franco-
Prussian war, it became part of the — of the Austrian-Hungarian empire. Because not
her father, but her uncles all served in the Austrian army in World War I. And then,
after World War I, it became — let’s see, after World War I, I guess it was Polish, and
after World War II, I think now it’s Ukrainian. So, I can show you a document that I
have, and they — the — the brothers of —
Q: Mm-hm, of your late wife.
A: Of her father.
Q: Okay.
A: The fa — his generation, born 1885, he — her father was.
Q: Right.
A: His brothers, who were — their oldest one was born in — in ’73, 1873, they all
served in the Austro-Hungarian army. I have pictures of them in Austrian-Hungarian
uniform. And one of them, her father, I believe, when he came to Germany, he —
they — they all had a business together in Hamburg, in Germany, and they ha —
Frankel is a pretty German name. And so he’s — his — his fr — his first name when he
was born was Moses, and he changed it, in Germany, he changed it to Moritz(ph).
So in Germany, he was called Moritz(ph). And in 19 na — 1920 — and I don’t quite
understand it, but I’d have to study a lot of history to figure it out, but in 1920 he —

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
Interview with Ralph Hockley "
January 12, 2016
he wanted to go from Hamburg to Solingen, which is in what we now call North
Rhine-Westphalia —
Q: That’s right.
A: — on a business trip. And he had to go to the Chamber of Commerce, for the
Chamber of Commerce to support — to support the request. And so, they supported
the request. And — but on the — on the application, or on this paper, there’s a
statement, says, what’s your nationality? And — 1920, and — and he answered Polish.
And — and printed on the form it said, and what was it before 1919? Because World
War I stopped in ’18, what was — an — an-and then before — so, a year before, his
nationality was Austro-Hungarian. So, you know, just trying to figure out what you
were, wasn’t exactly easy in those days.
Q: Could be confusing.
A: It could be very confusing.
Q: Very confusing.
A: But they all — they — they then, you know, they all had then German first names,
from about that period on.
Q: Now, did you discover these things about your family through your own research,
or were your parents storytellers, who told you about their lives, their childhoods,
what — what — who their parents were, who their grandparents were? How did you
discover what you ha — what you now know?

Interview with Ralph Hockley "
January 12, 2016
A: Well, I guess there are two answers to that, as a child. I lived in Germany until I
was eight years old, and as children we — we went to see the grandparents on my
mother’s side. My father — my father was the youngest of 10.
Q: Okay.
A: And his parents were long dead.
Q: I see.
A: I never knew my pater — my — my father’s parents, but he had all kinds of an —
brothers and sisters, so we went to visit the aunts and the uncles, and so on. And I
happened to be very interested in fa — I always knew everybody. To this day, I can
tell you what somebody looked like. But about their childhood, about my father’s
childhood, I know absolutely nothing. I have a sister, Diane, who is a year older than
I am, and she is a PhD from Berkeley, and very into social work, and I —
occasionally I consult with her, to find out whether she remembers. There are things
that she remembers differently than I do. But I know a lot more about the family
than — than she does. That was not part of her sphere of interest. On — so on my
father’s side of the family, I knew — I knew unc — aunts and uncles as a child, just up
to the time I was eight or nine. As a— on my mother’s side of the family, I knew the
family, cause as children, we spent every summer in Bavaria with my grandparents,
and particularly with my mother’s sisters kids, who were the same age we were.
Q: Your — you said your father came from a family of 10?

January 12, 2016
A: Yeah —
Q: What about —
A: — but you know —
Q: Yeah?
A: — it — it — it was, if you go and look at the family tree, his father was one of who
knows how many, and — and they all had 10 — eight to 10 kids, so that trying to
figure this thing out like this, it’s —
Q: You can get a clan in no time. So, stories about your father’s childhood, about his
growing up, are kind of a blank, even though you did know your aunts and uncles,
his brothers and sisters. What about from your mother’s side? How many siblings
did she have?
A: She was one of four.
Q: Okay.
A: She was the second oldest.
Q: And were they all girls or boys — or were there some boys?
A: Three girls, one boy.
Q: Okay. And let’s — let’s go through names. What was your mother’s name’?
A: Lilly(ph).
Q: Lilly(ph). Lilly(ph) Lowenthal. And her — her sisters?
A: Her oldest sister was Elsa(ph).

January 12, 2016
Q: Elsa(ph), okay.
A: Her brother, who was next, was Walter.
Q: Okay.
A: And her small sister was Margaret.
Q: All right. And your grandparents on her side?
A: They’re Hermann(ph), and Yula(ph).
Q: And Yula(ph), all right.
A: So they had — and my grandfather was born in 1857, so in — in 1857, his name
was already Hermann(ph).
Q: Okay, so that’s kind of like where the start — the start of this transition?
A: Yeah.
Q: It’s interesting.
A: Yeah.
Q: I never knew — I mean, I never knew that, that it would have been in this ye — in
these years that there would be this assimilation, this a — this attempt at assimilation.
And, until Hitler, who knew that it wouldn’t be successful, you know?
A: Yeah.
Q: Because there was assimilation.
A: It would have been successful. It was successful.

Interview with Ralph Hockley "
January 12, 2016
Q: Yeah, yeah. Was your mother’s family — how did — how did your grandfather
support your — his family, on your mother’s side?
A: Well, let me say that both of my families were fairly well-to-do.
Q: Okay. That was one of my questions.
A: Whatever that means.
Q: Well, it means different things.
A: My — my maternal grandfather, Hermann(ph) Lowenthal, in those days they had
the habit of marrying younger women, right?
Q: That habit hasn’t changed, you know.
A: My — my grandfather was born in 1857, my grandmother was born in 1876, so
she was basically 20 years younger than he was. So, when we, as children, got to see
him, that was a big deal. We — he was an — already an old man. In those days, you
know, if you figure it out, he was 57; in 1900, he was 43; and in 1930, he was 73.
When we knew him, he was at least 70 years old. My grandmother wasn’t, but he
was. He had a — with his brothers, he had a ladies haberdashery store, a big one, in
Munich, right one block from the bahnhof. And as kids, we were permitted to go
there, there was a building with two stories. The hats were made upstairs, not in
China. And — and we — we could watch them make the hats, and the thing that
fascinated us is they had a — they had a dumbwaiter, or whatever you call the tubes.
Q: Yeah.

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Ralph Hockley :
January 12, 2016
A: They had a tube, so all of the — the — the accounting department was upstairs.
Q: Oh, so that —
A: So somebody bought a hat, they pa — they gave the money, they got a bill, and
gave the money to the salesperson, and it was put in the tube, and they took care of it
upstairs.
Q: How cool.
A: And we th — we thought that was — as kids, we thought that was great. Those are
the little things I remember, but —
Q: Yeah.
A: — our relationship with my grandparents was distant.
Q: And why would that be?
A: Very warm.
Q: Okay.
A: Because chi — in those days, children — children — as one of my cousins famously
said once, les enfants ne parle pas a table. He was French.
Q: Yeah.
A: Children are seen, but not heard. Which is totally against everything that we
believe in, because we f-figure that kids learn from talking with their parents, not the
opposite. But in those days — now, what I have to add is that my grandparents had a
maid, the cook, everything goes with it. And the maid, Lena, was in charge of the

January 12, 2016
kids when they came to visit, and my — my — my aunt and uncle — Elsa(ph), the older
sister, lived around the corner. My — my grandparents had a big apartment. If you’ve
ever been to Munich, it’s one block from the — from the Oktoberfest, from the
Theresienwiese.
Q: Wow.
A: That’s where they lived. And my grandfather’s brother lived in the building next
door. And my aunt and uncle, now they lived in apartment houses, very nice
apartment houses where a floor was big. My aunt and uncle, Elsa(ph), and her
husband Karl(ph) Heiman(ph), they lived around the corner, they had a big villa.
And so, as kids, we spent a lot of time over there, because their kids were the same
age as we were, approximately. But when we got to Munich, to — with my
grandparents, Lena was in charge of us. Lena took us places, and — and then, you
know, my — my grandmother, I don’t know what she did, but she worked in the store
with my grandfather. And they came home, you know, they come home for lunch,
and they have a big lunch, the main meal, and then they take a nap. And then, I still
have that problem, when I eat, I always have to go to sleep. So don’t feed me too
soon. They — we were permitted to stay up until my grandparents came home, about
7:30, eight. We could spend 10 minutes with my grandparents, and then pff, off to
bed we went. So —
Q: Formal.

A: It was very formal.
Q: Yeah.
A: It was very formal. So —
Q: But is — they also sound like very nice memories.
A: Oh yeah. Nobody was nasty.
Q: Yeah. Oh, you know, from a childhood, you know, you — you’re painting a
picture for us, you know, of the bahnhof, of th — of the — of the, you know,
haberdashery store, of the — the tubes, and so on. That’s — that’s exactly the kind of, I
guess, evoca — you know, I want to have it evoked.
A: Yeah.
Q: What did it look like, what did it feel like?
A: Well, the — the — you know, from a sociological point of view, what this means is,
because they had a maid and a cook, that meant that the parents had time for other
things.
Q: That’s right.
A: Nowadays, parents spend 24 hours a day catering to everybody, especially the
mother.
Q: Yeah.
A: So, you know, it’s a totally different world.

January 12, 2016
Q: Well, when you look at houses here that were built for well-to-do people in the
late 19"", early 20" centuries, there are often two staircases; one for the family, and
one for the servants, you know. And to maintain such houses in those days —
A: It took — yeah.
Q: — you couldn’t — you needed servants. And now —
A: Yeah, I can tell you that the house I grew up in — if you like to, my wife can bring
you a picture of it — was also a big house.
Q: Tell me about it. Paint a picture about that.
A: It was in Redtenbacherstrasse, number two, in — still standing — in Karlsruhe. It
— it was a eine familie house, a one family home. Nowadays, it’s four apartments in
it. But it — it — you know, it had a basement, and the main floor. The main floor had
the kitchen, the dining room, the living room, and das klavierzimmer.
Q: My gosh, a piano room?
A: A piano room. And which you were only permitted to go into when there was
music being performed.
Q: Well, who knew how to play?
A: Well, that depends who came along.
Q: Oh, but I mean in your family, was there somebody who knew how to play?
A: My mother and father didn’t play.
Q: Okay.

January 12, 2016
A: No. But we had lots of relatives.
Q: And did you have lessons?
A: But the main thing was the — the — the — the — you could call it den now, because
there was a — I don’t know how you say it in English — Kachelofen. There —
Q: Oh, one of those stoves that —
A: One of these stoves —
Q: — ovens —
A: — built in with — with tiles on it, and with a bench around it, you could sit on the
bench to warm yourself, cause you know, that was the way it — everybody
congregated there when it was — when it was cold.
Q: So it was coal oven. It was a co —
A: Coal oven, yeah, yeah.
Q: It was a coal oven, yeah.
A: And — and then upstairs were the bedrooms, and then there was another floor
above, that had its own access to this little apartment, presumably for the maid, but
our maids all came in. We had mainly one maid, she did everything. She raised my
sister and me, and her name was Sophie, and she cooked. And the thing that I
learned, you know — you don’t know yet — but I spent 25 years in Germany as an
intelligence officer for the U.S. government. And because of my position, I had vil —
villas, and they — in Berlin, and in — in Munich, I had similar houses. And the one

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
Interview with Ralph Hockley “
January 12, 2016
thing that absolutely floored me, was that the kitchens were all abysmal. The
kitchens were — I mean, they were small. All of them, every single one. In Berlin, in
Munich, the — the — the kitchens and — and the one I — I — I grew up in, as a child,
they were all a postage stamp. And the only theory I have developed is that, you
know, this was for the angestellte, you know, it was for the —
Q: For the employees.
A: — employees that didn’t need much space, which is contrary to everything I
believe in, but —
Q: Yeah.
A: — the — my — my wife and I, my late wife and I, in Berlin, and — and in Munich,
the first thing we did when we moved into these houses is to change the kitchen. But
you couldn’t enlarge it, there was no space, but you could change stove, and a few
other things, you know, because it just wasn’t functional according to our concept. I
had the good luck that the houses I lived in in Germany in my career were owned
by the German government, and all I had to do is pick up the telephone, call the
American engineers, military engineers, and say hey, I need this and this, and it
came.
Q: Let me tell you, that sounds like a dream renovation plan, you know.
A: Well, we did — were weren’t able to renovate it that much, but we were ab — able
to update some things.

officer post-war, what were the sections of Berlin that you lived in?

some of your earliest memories from growing up in this house across the street — oh
no, your father’s business was across the street.

Q: Okay. And — oh, I just had a question in my mind. Your first years in school, do
you have any memories of —
A: Yeah.
Q: — your first school year?
A: I spent — I went for two years, I went to school —
Q: Okay.
A: —1n Karlsruhe, before we left. My sister went three, at least. I think that was all.
You know, first grade, second grade. I had been to a kindergarten, which was private
Q: Okay.
A: — before that, for a year. And I just remember — all I remember 1s I went to
kindergarten, I remember the lady in charge, and that’s about it. And then I went to
first grade and second grade. Now, you have to understand, I went to first grade in
1932.

A: Yes. The — on Redtenbacherstrasse, about two or three houses down, there was
a family, and his name was Peitken(ph), and they had two boys, and the older one
was my sister’s age, and the younger one was my age. That mean — meant that the
older one was in the same grade as my sister, and I was — and the younger ones was
in my class. And they were friends of ours. The younger one, Gurz(ph), was in my
grade. The minute the Hitler movement started, he became turned, and he wouldn’t

want to play with me any more, and he called me a dirty Jew, and a few other things.
The older one always —
Q: Did he even know what he was saying?
A: No, of course not. The older one never did that. He always remained friendly. But
there were, in my class of, I’m guessing 25 kids, there were four Jewish boys. I was
one of four, and my sister was about the same. At the beginning, we had no problem
at all, but once Hitler came to power, it became immediately — anybody who tells
you that actions against the Jews in Germany started with Kristallnacht is —
doesn’t know what he’s talking about. It started right from the — the first,
immediately, in *33.
Q: And you felt — and you felt 1t in school?
A: Oh yeah, they started — every morning they had to raise the swastika flag, and
they had to sing the — the — the Nazi national anthem, the Horst-Wessel-Lied, you
know. De file — I can sing it for you, you know.
Q: I mean, it’s — it’s bittersweet, but what do you remember? T-Tell me, what do
you remember from —
A: Well, I can —I get — I know the words for the Horst-Wessel-Lied because we had
to sing it every morning. And then, you know, the first year, I don’t remember who
my teacher was the first year. It may have been the same one, but I don’t remember
that. The second year, I had a guy by the name of Meininger(ph), who turned out to

be the head of the Nazi party in the area. And so, he took every opportunity to make
snide remarks about the — the Jewish kids. And —
Q: Well, that’s very cruel, you’re children —
A: Oh, he was — and you know, my sister always laughs about it, but she always
lucked out. Her — her teacher was the nicest guy in the world, always. And I always
got these — these — you know, this — this was a tough age. I mean, you know, I was
what, seven years old, eight years old, seven years old. And if you did anything
wrong, you know — he had a stick, and you had to stick your hand out, and he went —
you know, and it burned. And you know, he wasn’t careful with Jewish kids, I mean,
there’s all these little, more than innuendoes. It was picked on, you know, and there
with watch — they would watch us. We had to salute, or something, when the flag
was raised every morning, and they would watch us. And if — if the Meininger(ph)
felt like — like it, he said well, you didn’t stand at attention when we were playing
the Horst-Wessel-Lied. Stuff like that. All this little stuff, you know.
Q: But again, in my mind, I’m thinking of a grown person, a grown — an adult, and
you’re not even grown children, you’re little kids, you know’?
A: I’m just a little kid, yeah.
Q: You’re little kids, six or seven years old.
A: Seven years old.

A: Jein means yeah, yes, and nein. So if it’s so-so, you know.

movement, she was a leader in a Jewish youth movement in Munich.

only time he ever went in a synagogue 1s when he married my mother, and that was
the first and the last time.
Q: Was there a reason why for him? Did he ever explain it?

often bemoaned the fact that we never found out anything about Dad, about th —
well, he died young, too, so the years when you would have done that, maybe, but
we could have found out something when he was young. We only know tidbits about

in an old traditional way, to find a wife and a bride, not in a new modern way, but in
a way that —
A: Well, my mother — you know, I’ve read some of this stuff with — earlier heirs. My
mother belonged to a generation that was not subserv — where the wim — as a
woman, she was not subservient to men, which was a new thing.
Q: Yeah.
A: And she had her own — she was well educated, better than her siblings. My father
was educated better than his siblings, and I think that was the common denominator.

Q: Was he a patriot?
A: Yes. And that’s something that has not writ — been written about — enough, about
the — the — the pre-war, pre-Hitler Germany, but th-there were a lot of them who
were patriots. He was very proud to have served in the German army. And that’s one
of the reasons why so — and then Hitler came, in ’33, and immediately, Jews were
scum. And my father, who was a man of great integrity, he — he couldn’t accept that.
And that’s why he left. He left in — he started leaving in 34, it took two years to do
the whole move.
Q: And there are two — there — we’ll come to that in a moment, but there’s an
impression that I get from your telling, that — and tell me whether or not this is an
accurate impression — one, it must have been extremely painful. If you had — if you
si— identified yourself with a nation and a people, and all of a sudden you’re thrown
out of that, it’s a real — it’s a personal rejection. Then —
A: Yes, especially if you just finished serving four years, risking your life —
Q: Life.
A: — for the country that’s doing it to you.
Q: Yeah. So that — I mean, I’m sus — that’s the impression I would get, if you — if
you believed in it, if you put your heart and soul into it, and put your life on the line,
this is — this is personal. Number two, there’s a great deal of foresight in that. Very
few people left in 1933, ?34, ’35 — you know, most were saying, it — 1t’Il blow over.

par — your father’s decision making, too? Was he calculating, in that way?
A: Well, I think — I think — I can’t prove it —
Q: Okay.
A: — but I think that the reason we went to France is because of that. That all of his
relatives, on both sides of the family, said [speaks other language] you know, all
this will go away. Hitler won’t last, the others didn’t. And so they didn’t leave. And
so my father, I guess argued with himself that if he went t-to France, when it’s all

wealthy, had a big textile business, and he knew everybody in government, and
elsewhere. And, you know, they kind of pooh-poohed the fact that dad wanted to
leave Germany.
Q: And did Dad want to leave Germany because he was so hurt, or because he said
mm-mm, nothing good out of this.
A: It’s hard to answer. It’s probably both. I — he was hurt. He had quote unquote,
loyal customers for years, butchers mainly, who one day when he, or his
representative walked in to see him, said we don’t do business with dirty Jews.
Q: Oh.
A: And so, you know, you only need to hear that a few times before you — before
you say hey, do I have to put up with this?
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: So it was — but the fact that he had been in the military for four years during the
war, definitely played into it, because his — his brothers — well, one of them was in
the military, I don’t know much about that, but an-and his — on my mother’s side of
the family, nobody was ever close to that. And you know, there’s lots been written,
Ive read a lot. I have a book written by a German, at the request of the German
Minister of Defense, that’s in my f — later life, and — which explains what being a
Jew in— in Germany was like in 1914, when the Kaiser said — when the Kaiser said
to the Germans, you must all come fight with me for the — so on. The Jews — th-the

grand rabbi in Berlin, and I got his words, I got his sermon, had a — had a service in
which he said, we Jews must — we must answer the call of the Kaiser. The grand
rabbi of Berlin. So that was the frame of mind.
Q: Yeah.
A: And that was the frame of mind of many German Jews.
Q: Let’s tur — let’s turn a little bit to a different area, but we’ll come back to this.
Tell me a bit about your parents’ personalities; your mother’s personality, your
father’s personality. What kind of people were they?
A: Well, my mother had a never-ending social conscience. She — all of her life she
was always doing things for other people. She started as a student in Munich. She
was the head of the Jewish youth, and I — I have some letters in my documents,
where the — the — the council of Jewish — the Jewish congregation sent her a letter
thanking her for having led the effort during the elections, and without her, it never
would have happened. She was like this all her life, as I will explain to you later.
Without that kind of consciousness, I wouldn’t be sitting here. But my dad was very
intelligent. He was mainly, in the years that I knew him, he was mainly consumed in
making a living, which became ever more difficult in Germany, because of what I
said. And then when he went to France, nothing really worked.
Q: We’ll come to that.

A: Mother.
Q: Yeah? Okay. Same with your sister?
A: Yeah. My father favored my sister over me, but my sister, we have a strain in the
family, of petite woman, my sister had that strain. My father had a sister who was
petite, and my — my grandmother, whom I never knew, my father’s mother, was very
petite. I think that’s where the line is.
Q: Okay.
A: Then my Aunt Josephine was like that. My sister is four foot 10, maybe.
Q: Okay.
A: And — and so she always was pale, and my father always protected her, so that —

my father was more — I don’t think she talked that much more with him than I did.

as he went whizzing through the room. And it was just that kind of a world.

here? Do you remember them telling you about it?
A: No. I— what led up to it, what I said before, let’s start 1t from the beginning. We
witnessed a number of things happening —
Q: Such as?
A: — around us.
Q: Okay.
A: The one — for example, they arrested Jews from the beginning. I mean, in 1933,
the people who were judges, and university professors, and in charge of the opera, at
any position, who were Jewish, were out of a job. And they arrested people. There
was a family that we were friendly with, he — he was the Minister of Justice of — of
whatever it was then, Baden? It was in Baden-Wiurttemberg then. But — and he
was a socialist, and so he ha — and he was Jewish. So he had three strikes against
him, and he got arrested in the first bunch, and what they did, they put them on open
trucks, and they drove them through the city of Karlsruhe, so that people could spit
at them.
Q: This was the Nazis?

it. And — and — and the people on these trucks went to a concentration camp that
you’ve never heard of before, and I can’t remember. But —

Hitler didn’t like, I don’t know in what order, trade unionists, socialists, Jews,

the Catholic church in certain places, certain times.

A: I have no idea. It was a mistake that he was born.

Munich, I guess, my mother took us. And we stayed with my aunt and uncle and
their three kids, I would say, for three or four months. And — and that was in 734.
Maybe the fall of ’34 — I — the fall of ’34. After school — there was no school. The
new school year was starting, but it was at the end of ’34. And then, after that, we
were shipped from there — shipped to — to Mannheim, to stay with my father’s
oldest brother, and his wife. We stayed with them for three or four months. And then
we were sent to Switzerland. My father had a sister in the Zurich area, and her
husband was a teacher out in the country. And we were sent there for three or four
months. And we stayed with them on a farm.

about a year.
Q: What were they doing, your parents?
A: They were — they were setting up — they were taking care of the formalities
required to move to France. I can’t tell you where they lived at the time, whether
they — probably partially in Germany, and partially in — in F-France, but they
weren’t anywhere where we were. They came every once in a while to see us, of
course.
Q: Okay.
A: But so it — it’s in September of ’35, that we left Switzerland, and moved to
Marseilles.
Q: So, I have a few questions. Do you know if your father was able to sell his
business, or did he have to leave it?
A: I don’t know.
Q: Okay.
A: I assume he sold it, but I — they — they didn’t take things away from you yet, at

I’m making that assumption.

Charles Pollack(ph). And he had a — he was an importer/exporter in Marseilles, and

years old, nine years old, something like that? What was the world — what was the
impression? What was your first impression?

too far from where we lived. My sister went to a thing called [speaks French] which
was in a different direction, but about the same distance. And we were there to learn
French. And I was there, I would say, two semesters, to learn French, and then both
of us transferred to the lycée. I went to the boys’ lycée, when I was 10, I guess. I

A: I had no problem.
Q: Okay.
A: I did well in — in [speaks French], you know, I can show you the report cards.
And then went to lycée, and I — the classes weren’t that big. I would say about 20. I

And in huitiéme, which means I was in — in France two years, I got the first place in
French. And did that cal — cause an upset in the school.
Q: Well, yes.
A: I mean, the — the teacher — the teacher, who was very French, a lady teacher, she
stood in front of the class, and she practically screamed at them. Said, a little
German kid comes in here, and he has the first place in French? And, well, I had to
work harder, you know?

my sister. My sister was the top student in her lycée.
Q: My question was more to your — you’ve moved from Germany to France, and
are you immigrants, are you refugees? And how did the people in Marseilles look at
you, identify you? How — you know, how do you fit in as a family, as —
A: Well, we — we were — rented an apartment, which we kept the entire time, in a
middle class neighborhood.
Q: Okay.
A: There were certain things that were primitive. Like we lived on the top floor of
five stories, and no elevators or anything like this. The bathroom had a tub, but no
hot water. And it was —
Q: Was it a step down from Karlsruhe in modern conveniences?
A: Yeah, it was falling off the mountain. It was a step down, but as kids you don’t
realize it. Our parents saw to it that we had everything we needed. We never went
hungry. We went to school, we had a regulated life, and we had friends.

there were a number of them. Some of them were doctors, for example. Our doctor
was always somebody who was a German Jew. And even there, you have to split
hairs, because a lot of them came from the Saarland. The Saarland was French

from World War I, until 1935 or six, when they had a plebiscite, and they opted to
go with Germany. And so the Jewish people in Saarland, when this happened,
moved into France because they’d been living in France, and that was the natural
thing. A lot of people from Saarland, who lived in France afterwards, after the
Saar opted to go back to Germany.
Q: Okay.
A: So, our doctor was one of those, and there were a number of people like that, but
not many. Now, the Jewish people, I suspected if my parents had been religious, they
could have become more active, but that was not my father’s cup of tea. And my
mother was always conciliatory. And she did take my sister and me to the services at
the Jewish synagogue, the main one — there were several — but the main one, for the
high holidays.
Q: So it wasn’t regular, it was just sort of —
A: Just — just —
Q: Just for the high holidays.
A: — Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur.
Q: Okay.
A: And — but otherwise we didn’t. And the French Jews did not — any generalization

in German Jews. They were not nasty or anything, but they — they didn’t understand
that we were all in the same boat, as it turned out to be later.
Q: Yeah.
A: But so, there was one family that was very nice. Well-known family that invited
us, and stuff like that, but generally speaking, there was no effort on part of the — the
— the French Jews in Marseilles for an outreach towards the Jews from other
countries that had showed up.
Q: It was — it was too early for that consciousness. Is that what —
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. Well, what about your friends then, did you — so I take it most of your
friends were not Jewish in Marseilles?
A: All of my friends were not Jewish.
Q: All of your friends were not Jewish. Well, did you ever — if you went to the
synagogue on high holidays, did you ever go with them to —
A: Catholic mass?

Catholic country.
Q: Okay.
A: There — there was no — no challenge to the Catholic church. And the Catholic
church in France is very subdued, but they’re there.
Q: Okay.
A: And you know, you — if you were Catholic, as my best friend was, anything we
did, like we became Boy Scouts.
Q: Okay.
A: Anything that we did — if we left at seven o’clock on Sunday morning to go
camping, or go out somewhere on the coast, or something, he’d get up at four and go
to mass. And — and — and at seven o’clock, he was where he was supposed to be.
Nobody ever talked about the fact that he’d gone to mass. If I hadn’t known him so
well, I—I wouldn’t have known it. But, you know, that religion was a private part of
your life. And France to this day, you know, is very secular. I mean, very secular.
That — the — Dallas — you don’t know this, but Dallas has a school called the Dallas
International School, which the word international you can question, because it’s
totally French. I mean, from the top guy down it’s French, and they speak French,
and the kids all know French, learn French, and so on. But it says on the — on a big
sign, that this is a école laique, a lay school.

Q: Ah, secular school.
A: Secular school. Don’t misunderstand, this is not a French Catholic school. This is
a secular school.
Q: And why 1s this such a articulated distinction?
A: It’s the French constitution. Separation of church and state is in the French
constitution.
Q: And it permeated down, and actually means something —
A: Yeah.
Q: — at — at an everyday level.
A: Now the French — French Catholics — like everything else in life, there are many
exceptions, but the French Catholics are not super-religious. But they do get married
in the church, and they — they go to the fu-funerals in the church, and the — there’s
certain things that happen.
Q: So how did it come about that you went to mass?
A: Oh, because my friends were — were — were Catholic, and they took me along.
Was interesting to find out what other people do.
Q: Okay.
A: I never felt I was anything special, you know, I like to know how other people

A: But — and he did that. He must have made some money, otherwise we wouldn’t
have eaten, or paid the rent. But the — the main problem was political, or
administrative, in a sense that the French police, the security — Sireté, that dealt
with foreigners, was totally unpredictable. You never knew. My parents had a
residence permit, I believe by the year. Every year they had to renew it. And so, I’m
guessing, in ’37 or eight, probably closer to seven, but maybe somewhere at the end
of seven, beginning of eight, he went on a business trip to the f — Swiss border, to
Basel. And he was in Basel visiting clients, and then he said — he had a client over
on the other side.
Q: Beani — meaning where?
A: In Switzerland.
Q: In Switzerland.
A: But you know, Basel is right on the border.
Q: Yeah.
A: And it’s parch — partially the suburbs. I mean, in France, in — the main city is.

A: — where the — they had — if you ever tried to get into Switzerland, you know
that’s a major job. They — he went to the border station at the French side, and asked
them whether he could go to Switzerland, to Basel, just to visit a client. And the
guy in the — in the French custom house, or custom, or maybe immigration police,
whatever the p — the guy was, said, well you gotta go over there, and ask. So he went
to the Swiss guy, on — you know, hundred feet, maybe. And he said, this is who I
am, and I’d like to visit a client. And so they accused him of having crossed the
border illegally.
Q: Oh my.
A: And so they didn’t do much, except they made note of it. And then he went back
to — and he did go over, but he went back to Marseilles, and from then on, in his
police record, it said in Marseilles that he crossed the border illegally. And that was
added to the following historic fact.
Q: Okay.
A: That my mother and my dad were in Marseilles, I believe around the 20" of
October, 1934, to lay things out.
Q: So this is before you even moved there.
A: And they — they were downtown. The king of Yugoslavia, Alexander the first,
came on a State visit, and he went in a motorcade down the — the Canebiere, which
is the main street in Marseilles. And they were standing in front of — front of the

stock exchange, and within, I don’t know, a hundred feet of them, King Alexander
was shot by a Croatian terrorist, and the French foreign minister, Barthou, was
wounded seriously. And because they were so worried about Alexander, they forgot
about Barthou, and he bled to death. And so Alexander was — King Alexander was
killed, and so was Barthou. And all of the foreigners who were in Marseilles on
that day, got put in a register. And when this thing — when the Swiss border came up,
there now were two facts against him. He was in Marseilles when the king of
Yugoslavia was assassinated, which he obviously had absolutely nothing to do with,
but he was there.
Q: Yeah, okay.
A: And then he crossed the border into Switzerland illegally. And that haunted him
from — from then on.
Q: Bureaucracy, you know, sort of —
A: And you know, in the French police, you had — you had good guys and bad guys,
like everywhere else, and so this was — so that was in °34. In ’37 — eight, he had that
Swiss thing, and the — the next time they went to extend their — their — their — it may

Q: But that’s not true, because they had all the permit — okay, it doesn’t matter.
A: Well, truth — truth di — truth is unimportant when somebody wants to do
something who has police power.
Q: Yeah.
A: And so they kept my father, and they let my mother go because she had two
children. I was about 12, 13, and my sister was 13, 14.
Q: So this would have been ’37 — ’38?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: It was definitely before the war. And th-the strange thing about it — there are
many strange things about it, but one of them was that that particular afternoon, my
sister and I had been invited to the home of one of her teachers for her son’s birthday
party. And my sister was invited, and they let come along, because my parents had to
go to the police. And you know, and all the kids left, and my sister and I were there,
and Mother didn’t show up. And then ultimately she did show up. And she walked in
the door, and she said, they have arrested my husband. And it so happens that this
teacher’s husband was a high police official, and — which helped, because obviously
they knew who we were, they knew us and they were friendly. But nevertheless, my

mother was out on temporary whatever, my dad was in jail. In jail, where they put
him in a cell with a — with a guy who killed a captain in the es — a guy who killed a
captain in the French harbor. And they put my father in with him, because he was
from Switzerland, they boy spoke German.
Q: Well, there’s something in common, you know.
A: You know, I mean a — it — the circumstances of — of some of these things 1s just
unbelievable. So my dad was in jail, which I think did more to attack his health than
anything else, because he was a — again, a man of great integrity. Now he’s sitting in
a French jail. French jails are not known to be exactly nice places.
Q: Yeah.
A: And so after about a month — and I have no idea whether it was — it was quite a
while. I don’t know, it was four week, six weeks, whatever it was, they — they
brought him up for trial, and he was acquitted. So he came home. But he was very
much taken by this. But my mother wasn’t tried, hadn’t been tried, because she was
a separate case, I guess. And so a little while later they — they tried her. And they
found her guilty. And so, really —
Q: And so what happened to her?
A: Well, they — they expelled her from France. And so you say, what do you do?
Well, her sister, the sister from Munich, the wealthy people from Munich —

sister in Paris, and she — she went to Paris, and then she came back, and then we
changed attorneys, and she appealed her expulsion. And she had a — now, a good
attorney, and she was acquitted by the Court of Appeals. But you can imagine, you

Q: Absolutely.
A: So anyway —
Q: You’re insecure to begin with, yeah.
A: And this is, you know — and then of course on the political scene now, in ’38, th-
the Germans, the Nazis invaded Austria, and took over Austria, and in the spring of
°39, they invaded Czechoslovakia, and took over Czechoslovakia, and everybody

Q: I have a question at this point. You mention that your — your aunt was in Paris.
And my question was, during these years that you are in France, in Marseilles,
what’s going on with the rest of the family that you’ve left behind? Have they

happens?

about them. My great-grandfather, in the mid-1800s, established a company in
Hockenheim, which was a tobacco — particularly cigars, cigar manufacturer. Must
have been a big deal, from everything — if you go to Hockenheim today, they’|I tell

The two of them were the heads of that, of the cigar industry in Hockenheim. They
— they — but Albert and his wife, Alfreida(ph) did not leave. Then there was
Alfreida’s sister, who was married to a younger brother of my uncle, my father. His
name was Louie, he was a bank president. See, they all had gotten into their own
fields, he was a bank president. They didn’t leave. The — there were quite a few of
them. And I say this for a purpose. Because, after France fell, in June of 1940, the —
some guy who wanted to — guy by the name of Wagner(ph), who was in charge of
the — for the Nazi party in Stuttgart wanted to make Hitler believe that he was a
genius. He invented the situation. You may read it differently in history books, but
he — he told Hitler, we got to get rid of — they say we got to get rid of the Jews. And
so they organized a deal where all the Jews of Baden — I don’t know about
Wirttemberg — I mean, he wasn’t in Wiirttemberg then, but Baden and Pfalz,
which is Palatinate were ordered to be shipped out. They were put on trains and
shipped not east, but to France, to the Gurs concentration camp, in the Pyrenees, in
France. And so my dad — we haven’t talked about that, but —

aunts, 84 years old, and the whole family wound up in this concentration camp in
Gurs which — where the conditions were not — they lived in barracks, and it was not
very good. We’|l talk about Gurs later.
Q: Yeah, we will.

A: No, not 10, they — you know, they, through the years they got spread out. Let’s

United States before World War I.

Louie, the bank president. He died in ’38 of a heart attack, but had this wife and
daughter who wound up in Gurs.

health services weren’t as good then as they are now, I guess. The second one, I
don’t know when she left, Josephine. She was married — the first husband died, she
was married to a other gentleman by the name of Odenheimer(ph), who lived in
Baden-Baden, and then she came to the United States. So she made it out before
France fell. And then the young — younger one, the sister was Amalia(ph), and
she’s the one who married the gentleman in Switzerland, that we went to stay with.
So she was in Switzerland, so she was safe. In those days, th-the girls, the sisters,
had absolutely nothing to say about what they did. It was the Albert — Albert in s —
in lieu of parents that didn’t live, and probably Louie the bank president, because he
had prestige, decided what the sisters would do, who they would marry, or not
marry, and it was all organized. It’s a different society. The — so that was
Amalia(ph), and then my dad was next. So that’s where they were. I saw — just a
little side story — I saw Amalia(ph), I used to, when I was stationed in Germany, I
went to visit her, after her husband — second husband died, and then she wound up in

you know. I mean, think about this, he said the — that, you know, we — we need more
lebensraum, we need more living space for the country. Well, but — but after the
war, the Bundesrepublik Deutschland, without East Germany, became the most
powerful economic thing in the world, with the space that they had. So, you know,
that — this stuff is all just to suit his — his purposes. He wanted —
Q: Well, he was stoking resentment.
A: Yeah, exactly.
Q: He was stoking resentment —
A: That’s right. He wanted to get the people to — and — and — and — and — and tell
them that we’re the thousand year Reich, and we’re going to dominate history. And
so that’s he — he — that’s how he sold the thing.
Q: Okay.

A: I mean, there were good people in Germany. They’re good — you know, it’s just
like we talk about France. Some — some of the police guys were bad, some of the
neighbors were questionable, but there were an awful lot of good people. I mean, I
could tell you the story that, when we lived in Marseilles, the — the guy that owned
our apartment, I don’t know how many months he didn’t get paid rent. He never said
— never said a word. He knew who we were, and that — what the circumstances were.
And I suspect we'll get to how we got out of France later.
Q: Oh, a-absolutely.
A: Yeah.
Q: Absolutely.
A: Pll tell you a story about one of our neighbors which is moving to the end, I
mean, it’s just — so, you know, it’s — there are good people everywhere.
Q: I know. It is — simply is — isn’t it a—I guess the — one of the things that one
should never do is ask a leading question. And here I am, and I’m going to ask a
leading question, and that — and it’s just to go on this theme a little more. Isn’t it
more — isn’t it easier to sell this bill of goods that you described, to a populous that is
raised not just to know what is right from wrong, but to ask for permission at every
step of the way, of may I do this, may I not do this? And who are the authorities?
Versus a population that believes in égalité, fraternité, and — and liberté? You
know, a population that is also guaranteed, as in the United States, a constitution of

freedom of expression, and freedom after expression, you know? Freedom of
Speech, in other words. I — it’s just —
A: So your question is, is it easier to do it the way the Germans did it?
Q: No. Is it easier to do it to a population which has a value in it that you have to ask
permission for everything that you do in your life? In other words, that you accept
authority easier, than in countries where authority is — it’s okay to question it.
A: Well, the Germans — I’m trying to figure out how to answer that. The Germans
are by custom — not probably so much today, but were then, a people who only
operated by authority. I — I like to say in 1945, when I was in Paris, and this is the
difference between I — you know, the French have poli — political cabarets, and you
can hear stuff that you don’t hear anywhere else. But my saying then was, the
difference between a Frenchman and a German is that a German is on a Metro in
Paris, and he has trouble coughing. He needs to cough and to expectorate, and the
sign says, in the subway, défense de cracher. Spitting prohibited. And so the
German will stand there and go — and practically strangle. The Frenchman will come
along, and he says — and he looks at the sign that says, défense de cracher, spitting
prohibited, and he’! spit at the sign.
Q: [laughter] You answered my question.
A: So, you know, it’s a — it’s — people are different. The French, even the French are
different from themselves.

A: Like Americans are different from themselves. The northern French are very
cold, the southern French are very, ah, laissez aller, let — you know, manana.
Q: Live and let live, huh?
A: Yeah.
Q: It’s an interesting example. Can we cut for just a second? [break] So you —
you’ve kind of described to me that many of your father’s relatives who were still in
Germany, got to Gurs — were transported to Gurs — deported to Gurs. Can you tell
me what their fates were? Did all of them make it out of Gurs, or did some of them
not?
A: Both. No, that can’t be both. Some of them made, and some didn’t.
Q: Okay.
A: And some died there. My father’s oldest brother, Albert, and his wife
Alfreida(ph) —
Q: Okay.
A: — made it out. Their son lived in Los Angeles, and he was able — I don’t know the
details, but he was able to get them out, after we were gone. That’s why I don’t
know the details. His — as I told you, Albert’s wife Alfreida(ph) sister was married
to his brother Louie. They were two sisters married to two brothers. Louie had died
in 38, in— 1n Germany.

Q: Heart attack, I think you said.
A: Yeah, that’s what the records say. I had heard that he — the Gestapo came to arrest
him, and he had a heart attack. So, whether it was this way, or that way, but he was a
very formal man, what I knew of him. He would not open a door without having
gloves on. Kid gloves, you know, suede gloves.
Q: Wow.
A: Door handles had germs on them. He died in °38, and his widow, Clara, and her
daughter Annie(ph), who’s my first cousin, were shipped to Gurs, together with a
group. Then there were a couple of old aunts, couple of whom died in Gurs. The
conditions in Gurs were not like in Auschwitz or — or Dachau, but they — they were
not good. You were, quite basically, exposed to the elements, living in these — in — in
— in barracks. She was still there. She was there throughout ’42.
Q: Annie(ph), or — or — or —
A: Both the mother and daughter, Clara and Annie(ph) were there. There’s quite an
exchange, some of which I owe to this gentleman here, of correspondence that he got
from the Quakers, and we’ll get to that.
Q: Okay.
A: But where the — where she, in ’42, was asking for money, because she had no
money, and — and so on. So, I believe — I’ve got the date, I believe it was August of
42, that we got a postcard from her, Clara. We’re being loaded on a train, we do

Annie(ph) got gassed in Auschwitz, and — [sound of plane] Unfortunately, we’re on
the pattern for Love Field.
Q: Okay. So they were shipped to Auschwitz.
A: So they — they were shipped to au-aus-aus — Auschwitz. I have in the documents,
which I have for Ron, one of my cousins sent a letter in ’45, sent a letter to Gurs,
when it was — there was still an administration there, and asked what happened to
them, and I have the letter from them that says what train they were shipped off on.
Didn’t say to Auschwitz, but —
Q: And just for the camera, for clarification, you’re talking about correspondence
that you got from my colleague, Ron Coleman, at the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum, to augment what you already knew’?
A: No, that correspondence I got from the family archives.
Q: Okay.
A: That particular one. But the — th-they have — th-they have the layout — you have
the layout at the Holocaust Museum, which even gives the dates, and so on.
Q: Right. So that — those relatives didn’t make it.
A: They did — they didn’t make it. Then some died there. There was an Aunt
Sophie(ph) that was in her 80s when she — she’s buried there. Caroline and I went
to Gurs about 10 years ago, and there’s not much left of it, but the cemetery is there.

The people five miles from there, they don’t know what Gurs was, which is always
pathetic. But there is a monument there with a train car, to remember. And the
cemetery is there. Which is a point of interest. The city of Karlsruhe sends students
to Gurs every summer, to take care of the cemetery, which should be noted as a
statement of —
Q: Not forgetting.
A: — solidarity, or whatever.
Q: Or not forgetting.
A: Or not forgetting.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah. They didn’t have to do it, but they’re doing it. Karlsruhe is very, very pro
remembering the past, and all the bad things that were done. They’re very nice.
Q: Let’s turn back now to your family, and your immediate family in Marseilles,
and your father is released, and your mother is tried and found guilty, and then gets
another lawyer, and is acquitted. This must have taken a psychological toll on
everybody.
A: Yes. The kids — also on the kids, but kids tend to be engaged in the daily activities
and so on. It obviously was very hard, but as they say in German, if we’re adults, es

Q: More resilient, in some ways.
A: Yeah. Well, and they don’t have any responsibility, you know, whereas the adults
have responsibility for everybody.
Q: Yeah.
A: He — he was released, Mother was — so that was, obviously in — in ’38 sometimes,
I can’t tell you when.
Q: What happened after that? How did life progress?
A: Okay, so parallel to all this, the — the Germans, Nazis, occupied — took over
Austria. Then in the beginning of ’39, Czechoslovakia. And on the first of
September, ’39 — I’m laughing for a purpose, but they invaded Poland. After they
had had non-aggression pacts with the Soviets, and whatever. On the third of
September, France and England declared war on Germany, and that was the
beginning of World War II. Immediately when the war started, my dad, as now an
enemy alien, was arrest — arrested. Interned, is maybe a better word. Sent to les
Milles, which was a camp near Marseilles, in Aix-en-Provence, which is near
Marseilles. And they collected all the people they didn’t know where they fit in, and
what did — who had a background from — at — now, at this point, this was a French
action, nothing to do with the Germans.
Q: So he’s a German, and Germans are now our enemies, and so therefore.

Q: M-i-I-l-e?
A: No, M-i-I-l-e-s.
Q: Okay.
A: Les in front of it, l-e-s. It was a brick factory that they converted into a — I guess
they ran out of what to do — they didn’t have any more bricks to make, so they used
it for this, and they made it internment camp. And this was the craziest assembly of
people that you ever heard in your life, because there were a lot of people who had
left Germany, prominent people who had left Germany, who lived in France, and
they’re the ones who wound up in Les Milles. That included Mare Chagall; that
included Lion Feuchtwanger, the famous author; that included Nobel prize
physicist Meyerhof, and I could go on.
Q: Enemy aliens, in other words.
A: They were enemy aliens.
Q: Okay.

them was a famous surgeon from Vienna, he came with his two — he had two

Q: Assistants?
A: — people that did things for him, you know? Household — he brought them along,
you know? They weren’t Jewish or anything, they were just — were his — his
employees. So they — they had them all there, and they didn’t know what to do with
them. It was not super-dangerous, there were all kinds of outside contacts, but it was
— but there was a fence around, and — and the conditions were not very good.
Hygiene, food, stuff like that. And my dad — that was in — in September, after the
war started. By December of — of ’39, he got out of there. He had friends in
Marseilles, which was nearby, that vouched for him, that he was a good guy, and so
they let him out. Some others never got out, but they let him out. And so, he was
home in Marseilles with us, until May of 40.
Q: Okay.
A: In May of ’40, the Germans, as you know, invaded Holland, Belgium,
Luxembourg, came into northern France and in — in — in — 1n two weeks, reached
Paris, and took Paris. And the French army was nowhere to be seen. I don’t know
whether that’s true, but that’s what it seemed like, because nobody stopped them.
Charles de Gaulle would have said, well, the Germans had tanks, and we didn’t.
And that was true. And so they just kept going. So then the question came for us — I
mean, the people from Paris, and so on, north, extreme south on the highways of
France, and we were in Marseilles, and so then the authorities in Marseilles

decided hey, what’s going to happen. And so they — as one of the first things they
did, is they took these people like my dad, and they put them back in Les Milles. So
some were, probably at the end of May, I don’t have the exact date, my dad was
back in Les Milles, where they had left — you know, ha — they had let them go.
Q: But there’s something — there’s something that’s really surreal about this, because
the point of being in Les Milles is if you were an enemy, and that means if you’re a
German who would support Germany, and the people that you mentioned, were not
those types of people.
A: Yeah, but the French couldn’t tell the difference, and there were people in Les
Milles who were not Jewish, quite a few.
Q: And were there some who actually were?
A: There were oc — an occasional Nazi in there, too.
Q: Yeah, that’s one wa —
A: Not by design, but by happenstance, because there were some Nazis who were
living in France, just like everybody else.
Q: Right.
A: And so they picked up everybody that was German, Austrian, Czech, and they —
if they didn’t know — you know. By this time, there were thousands of refugees in
Marseilles, because everybody from up north came down. There were hotels that —
the French police had police raids every day in downtown Marseilles, to find people

who were here illegally. And so there — the stories are endless. But they were back in
Les Milles, and the Germans ca — were coming south. And so, there wasn’t much
time between the 20" of May, you know, and so — so, about — and there, it’s a little
vague, the date is not quite sure. Let’s — the book on Les Milles says about the 20"
of May, I — of June — I don’t believe it, it’s — had to be a few days earlier, it just
doesn’t fit — they took — not everybody, but they took all the volunteers in Les
Milles who felt threatened by the Nazis, and is — and the — the comman —
commandant of Les Milles, who had some good sides to him. He was a reserve
officer, that the army wasn’t his thing, and he was running this camp, and he also
had a—a conscience, and so he decided to use his personal influence, and he — he
called up somebody he knew, and he — I just read that in a book, I didn’t know how
that worked. He called him up, and says, I w — I need a train. And so they produced a
train for him, and said, anybody who wants — who — who feels threatened, we’ll take
you away so the Germans can’t get at you. So they loaded all these guys —
Q: The Nobel prize winners, the —
A: Everybody. Lion Feuchtwanger, and Hans(ph) Klay(ph), the famous artist, and
I mean, there were dozens of them. They loaded them on this train, unless they
refused. Didn’t have to go on the train. But the train was the purpose of escaping the
Germans. And they — they put them on this train, and they headed west, towards the
Pyrenees, and basically towards the Atlantic. Bordeaux, Bayonne —

Q: Was your father on this train?
A: My father was on this train, and I don’t know, you know, he — you could visualize
that he could have said to himself, oh, but my family is in Marseilles, why do I want
to be on this train? Because they said it — they said they were going to take him to
North Africa, where they would be safe. I don’t know when they said that, but they
said that somewhere along the line. And so the train took off, and the captain — I
mean, the commandant of the ca — of Les Milles, kept track of the train, to be sure —
yeah, then he called — they he called — like, this is new information for me, but he
called a cousin of his, who owned the boat — the ship, in Bayonne, on the Atlantic
coast, and he said hey, I need you. I — you gotta be in Bayonne, | have got a
thousand — I don’t know what the number exactly was — of — of refugees here, I got
to get to North Africa. Well, how much are you gonna pay me? Well, 500 francs, or
whatever it was, a head. Okay. So, they put him on a train, and the train took off.
And he kept track of it, because the guy in Bayonne said, my ship will only be here
until such and such a date. They gotta get here. So he kept working over the railroad
official, so the train would keep moving, while the Germans were coming south.
And so my guess is, on the 19", I— you know, I’m a little vague on that, but on the
19" of June, we got phone call. We — my mother got a phone call from the Fr-French
police, and they said, oh you gotta evacuate. Be — be at the train station at six o’clock
in the morning.

o’clock in the morning, we’re gon — we’re going to take you away, take you out of
danger. So, okay, so we pack our bags, and you don’t know that you’re ever going to
come back, so we took clothing and food, cause you don’t know whether there is any
food. Well, then it happened that that night — and you can — we could figure out what
the date was, because that night in southern France was the heaviest thunderstorm I
have ever lived through anywhere. I mean, you thought the world was coming to an
end. And we thought at the time it was caused by the artillery, that the artillery fire
in northern France had caused so much disruption of the — of the atmosphere, that it
screwed up the weather. And anyway, it poured, and thundered, and lightning, I
mean — and there was no means of transportation. You couldn’t get a c-cab or
anything. Nothing moved.
Q: So you have this mandatory order that you have to be at this —
A: At the train station.
Q: Okay.
A: And so, we first — first we headed out, carrying suitcases, on foot. My house,

Garrute(ph), the Catholic kid who went to mass at five o’clock in the morning, that
I told you about. He was a couple of years older than I was. And I said, George(ph),
I need you. He says, sure. I said, you gotta help me carry suitcases. Okay. So my
mother and my sister went ahead, be sure to make — to be there on time when this
was supposed to happen, and — and George and I carried the suitcases. And we had
to stop every 20 feet, because we —
Q: Weren’t you soaking wet?
A: Well, that — the storm wasn’t that bad any more. That was the first installment.
Q: Okay.
A: By this time it wasn’t pouring any more.
Q: Okay.
A: And so we — we — somewhere we decided that we had too many suitcases, we
took a couple back to the house, and went with the rest of them. And we carried
them to the train station. It took us more than an hour to get to the train station.
Couple hours, I’m sure. We finally got — at dawn, we got to the front of the train
station, and then we were told, oh, you got to go to the back of the train station. We

had a pretty big train station. So, there was a cab there. So I took the cab, and I said,
okay, my mother has money, Ill — we’ll pay for the cab when we get there. And so
we put everything in the cab, and we went around to the back. When we got there,
my mother was hysterical, because I hadn’t shown up, and she didn’t want to leave
with me — without me. And so she finally saw me, and she — she just — I can tell you
that the train left about 15 minutes after I got to the back of the — of the train station.
And wi — it was one of these — many miracles I’ve experienced in my life, this one of
them. And so the train left. And the train went — there were all women and children,
there were no men on this. And this, you — you know, I have to say, you were a man
if you were over 18. Well, I wasn’t, I was 14. So I was a child. And we — the train
went, and there was a — it was a passenger train, with compartments. We were in a
compartment, the three of us, with two ladies that we knew well, a mother and —
mother and daughter, who was about my mother’s age.
Q: Were these also German Jews?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah. Whose — the younger one, her name — they were, Mrs. Jacob(ph) — the —
the — the mother, the old mother, she was probably in her 70s, her name was
Devries(ph), d-e-v-r-i-e-s. The elder frau Devries(ph). Because her son’s name was
Devries, and Millie Jacobs(ph) maiden name was Devries, and so we had the old

Mrs. Devries, and Mrs. Jacob(ph), and my mother and my sister and I in this
compartment. And — and we went and stopped, and went and stopped, and this — you
know, you — the Germans were coming south. Nothing worked. I mean, it was a
miracle —
Q: And you didn’t know where — did you know where you were going? Was there
any idea —
A: No, the only thing we knew, we were going west.
Q: Okay.
A: And the — we went to — wound up in Toulouse, and then after Toulouse,
whatever the next — Niemes. And — and — and then we wound up, and we — we
stopped in Lourdes. And Lourdes is well-known internationally, because of the
Catholic shrine there. And so we are parked in — on the tracks. And by this time, it’s
approximately the 20 — either the 21°, or 22™ of June. And we’re sitting there for a
while. We had gendarmes on board who were supposedly watching us, or taking
care of us, or whatever they —
Q: Could you leave the train at all? Could you go on the platform, as you were —
A: In principle not, but if I’d gone on the platform, nobody would have said
anything.

next minute.

know we were there four or five hours. And — and there was a — let’s see, we were
on this track here, and there’s a track here, and the platform between us. And the —
there’s a train parked here, that’s a freight train. And Pll — I’ll swear to my dying
day, it was a freight train, it was not a passenger train. And after a few hours, there’s
a woman on our train, who looked at the freight train, and saw her husband. And this
train, the pas — freight train, is what in history has gos — gone down as the phantom
train. Th-There are books written about the phantom train, I got a movie, and a — and
a — books about it, what the phantom train was all about. And that was the phantom
train. And after this woman discovered her husband, we all looked out, and got out,
and my dad was on that train.

say — you know, I thought that when it got to its end that they — the people got off,
and then the ship wasn’t there, and then they put them on a different train. But I have

A: They made us go back on our separate train, and they — and they said e — well,
what you have to understand is about this time, 22" of June, 19 —
Q: Forty.
A: — 40, the word came out that France had signed an armistice, and the war was
over.
Q: For them.
A: That the war between Germany and France was over. Now, what that meant,
nobody could tell, at that point. And so, they — they — I doubt that they had orders,
the guys in charge of these trains. It just what you do when you have to make a
decision. So the gendarmes made us go back on our train, and they — the — the
guards, th-the soldiers on the other train made them get back on their train, a-and
said, and I quote, “Well, don’t worry. The war is over. You'll — your husbands will
soon be home.” And they — and so that train left, and we left. We went back to
Marseilles. We went back home. So we were only gone a week, I — give or take, I
don’t know exactly, but so — and so, we went home. And this train didn’t go home.
They went to — they stopped them in — in Nimes, which is a city on the way, and
they unloaded them, and they established a camp called Saint Nicolas, Saint
Nicolas, and they put them in there. Well, that was a very poorly prepared camp, and

the first of September, they decided to move the people from Saint Nicolas to Gurs.
Q: Oh, is that how he ended up in Gurs?
A: That’s how he ended up in Gurs. Now to the history of Gurs is that Gurs was
established in 1936, to bring in the refugees from the Spanish civil war. And so the —
there probably were still some refugees of the Spanish civil war in Gurs when the
Germans arrived. And — and my father and his cohorts —
Q: The other enemy aliens, yes.
A: Yeah, the enemy aliens.
Q: Yeah.
A: And so, that’s how he wound up at Gurs.
Q: Okay.
A: And — and then, that was in sep — let’s say September, and on the — I believe it
was the second — 22™ of October that the Gauleiter of — of Wiirttemberg and
Baden and whatever, decided to send all the Jews from Germany down there. And
so that was the end of October that the people from Germany got there.
Q: In all this time, I mean it sounds that it’s — it — it was almost an — not necessarily
an ending, but a constant stream of insecurity for your parents, of registering with
the police, not knowing whether or not their — their residents’ permit would be

aliens, of being picked up, let go, picked up, let go, on a train, not on a train, but —
out of home, back to home. How did you have, I mean, not only the nerves that are —
are involved here, how did you eat? I mean, how were able to make money, how
were you able to make a li — how were they able to make a living?
A: It’s — that’s not a question that my sister and I can answer. We don’t know,
because we were children, and we were protected. I know that my parents sold
furniture and items from their — the household at auctions, when they ran out of
money. That much I know. Where the money came from to feed us, I have no idea. I
know we didn’t get any money from relatives anywhere else. As a matter of fact, if
anything, we gave money to people, members of the family who were in
concentration camps. You know, my dad did an occasional business deal. My
mother, when the war started, knitted genouillére.
Q: What’s that?
A: That’s a thing that — knitted woolen things that soldiers wear on the — on — genou
is the knee — wear on their legs to keep them warm in the front lines. She worked for
the war effort. But you don’t make any money at that, you know. Somehow, to her
great credit, she — somehow she scraped by. We — we don’t know how. We — there’s
no way we can figure it out. We know that our landlord didn’t push us if we couldn’t
pay the rent. But we ate, and — and then this period when my dad was there, before —

you know, there was — there was no food in France. I mean, forget about us, there
was no food. The only thing they sold in the — in the — 1n the grocery store were
rutabagas. If you present me with a rutabaga, Ill kick you out of the house.
Q: You’ve — you’ve had your fill?
A: That’s — that’s all there was.
Q: Okay.
A: And the — so that — I don’t know how we — how we lived. On the other hand, my
friends, my French friends, never quit being my French friends. And my sister’s
French friends, she was — she has French friends from her school that she — that she
calls on the telephone once a month to this day.
Q: To this day, wow.
A: And they’re all — my sister is now 91, going on 92, and they’ve always been our
friends. We grew up with them. They — they never said to us, you are a dirty
German, or something. They were our friends. And I’Il tell you that in a minute, how
— to what — how that works. But anyway, he was in Gurs, and we were here. Now,
September 19 — this is important, because without this, I wouldn’t be sitting here. In
September of 1940, school started. And you know, so I go to school, and she goes to
school. That’s the plan. And so I got to school, and they called me into the deputy
director of the school, with my mother, and they said, oh, you can’t come back. And

not? Well, we — you’re German. Your son is a German, and Germany has beaten
France, has defeated France, and the other kids, who will know that you are
German, will — will — will — will beat you up.
Q: He just didn’t want you there?
A: Maybe he believed it, I don’t know. And I said, I know, I said to him, nobody is
going to beat me up. All my classmates are my friends. That — just the way it was.
We been together for four or five years, and you know, I knew every one of them.
They’re all dead now, but I — if I walked down the street, they would embrace me.
And — but he wouldn’t relent. Okay. So now, my sister’s going to school, and that’s
why I say —
Q: And she doesn’t have the problem?
A: Oh no, there were — my sister never has any problems. It’s always me, because
I’m a boy. Girls get treated — Caroline doesn’t believe it, but I can guarantee you
that boys got treated differently from girls. And so Mother takes the position, well,
he’s 14 years old, Dad is in a camp, 14 year olds tend to get in trouble. Now, my
mother didn’t know my very well, because that was not something I knew how to
do. That wasn’t part of my scenario. But anyway, so she — Mother had an
unbelievable social conscience, and did — you know, what this woman did is way

A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.
A: It’s at the foot of — foot of the Pyrenees, near the Atlantic.

A: Do we have a map of that, Caroline, if we can show where it is?

A: No.
Q: Okay. So, correspondence only. Letters only.
A: Correspondence only. And so, but Mother tried to see how to get him out. You
always — there was always a possibility you could get somebody out. You could get
him out, if you could get him a visa to the United States. And so she was doing the
tour of the relief agencies, of which everything had come to Marseilles. Marseilles
was the center, the fulcrum of — of everything now, because all the refugees all —
everything had come down to this place. And so all of the relief agencies, the — the
Quakers, the — the OSE, Office de Secours Enfants, the — the — they took care of

A: It got established in June of —

of Pétain that were foo, right wing fanatics. They worked with the Germans, they
loved the Germans. So anyway — so Mother went, and took me along, to go to the
relief agencies, to see how — what to do about Dad. And we had an application. I

United States, and you have to supply affidavits from relatives, that you don’t
become a burden to the U.S. government, etcetera, etcetera.
Q: So at some point, the conversation had changed. You mentioned earlier than
when your parents moved to Marseilles, it was with the idea that that’s not so far,
we could go back at some point.
A: Yeah, well —
Q: And at some point, that changed.
A: Yeah, because the Germans went to war.
Q: Okay.
A: The minute the Germans declared war on — on — on the rest of Europe, to take
over the world, that was passé, you know —
Q: Okay.
A: — that wasn’t — didn’t exist any more. The first place we went to, were the
American Quakers, the Americans’ Friends’ Service Committee. They had an office
on Boulevard d’Athénes, 29. The train station, Gare Saint Charles that I told you
about, was sitting on top of the hill, and it — you could come straight down from
there. The — some steps, and then there was Boulevard d’Athénes, Boulevard of
Athens. And number 20 — on the — on the right hand side there was first the Hotel
Splendide, and then this building 29, where the Quakers took over the floor. And so

we went to 29 Boulevard d’Athénes, on the second floor, and there was a
receptionist, and —
Q: Did you speak English?
A: Well, ah, you caught me. I — the last two years in school, in lycée, I had taken
English, and I had the first marks in English, both years. And well, it was easier for
me, because I knew German, and you know, once you go languages, you —
Q: Yeah.
A: But, so I knew some English. I know — knew more English than kids who go to
American high school and take two years of anything. My English was better than
that. It wasn’t good, far from it. So we got there, and th — rang the doorbell, and this
lady, whose name I have to look up, because I knew it so well, opened the door, and
she was the receptionist sitting in the lobby there. And we told her what we wanted,
and we got to speak to a representative, and tell him the story, etcetera, etcetera, and
we went away. Mother observed that this was a total f— fallacy, this whole thing.
That here you have have only the clients, only spoke no French, they all spoke
German — most of them. Some of them spoke some eastern European languages, but
mostly German.

Mother offered my services as an interpreter. Volunteer.

something, because —
Q: To keep you off the streets.
A: Keep me off the streets, exactly.
Q: Okay.
A: And they accepted me.
Q: As a volunteer because you spoke languages?
A: Yeah. I could speak German. Anybody that walked in the door, that came for
help, I could ask them in German, what do you want? And I spoke French, I could
tell the lady there, that’s what they want. And I spoke some English, so I could
interrelate with the Quakers, who were very nice people.

Q: All right, let’s pause here just for a second, to get a sense of the lay of the land.
Can you describe the building for me, what it looked like? You said it was on the
second floor.
A: Yeah, was a big, old, well-built —
Q: Stone?
A: — stone apartment house, basically.
Q: Okay.
A: But they had offices. Maybe — I don’t know how long they had offices, they —
maybe they had always offices down below, but it was really an apartment house.
And the reason I mention that it was next door to the the Hotel Splendide is because
the Germans made the Hotel Splendide the headquarters of the armistice
commission. So every day, when I went to work for the Quakers, I had to go by
these damn cars, with swastika flags on. And which di — scary enough. And also
because — and this is way off from what we’re talking about, but there’s a guy by the
name of Varian Fry that you might be familiar with. Varian Fry came into — into
Marseilles, and made his headquarters in the Splendide.
Q: As well?
A: As well. Varian Fry was sent over by Eleanor Roosevelt to rescue a few
hundred people like the ones I described to you before. Nobel prize winners, famous

international painters, artists, engineers, poets, writers, musicians. And that was
Varian Fry’s task.
Q: And the surgeon with his two assistants?
A: I don’t know where he fit in.
Q: Okay.
A: Maybe the surgeon would have made it, but not the assistants.
Q: Yeah.
A: See, he had nobody to polish his shoes any more. But Varian Fry was there for a
while, but then he — he — he was advised to get out of there because the Nazis would
figure out who he is, and that — that would not be good.
Q: Did you meet him at the time? Did you know who he was?
A: I’ve met Varian Fry, but you know, I was a 15 year old boy, ve met him
because he came to our office, which was the headquarters of the Quakers, for the
whole Europe. And the —
Q: For all of Europe?
A: Yeah, they — well, they got kicked out of Paris, they got kicked out of Spain,
Marseilles was the only place left.
Q: Okay.
A: And I could ri — I could tell you about the Quakers for days. They — the kind of
people they were, the — unbelievable people.

Q: I would like to hear about it.
A: Yeah.
Q: But first, let’s talk about Varian Fry.
A: So, we —
Q: He came to your offices?
A: Well, he just came to visit.
Q: Okay.
A: And I, you know, I knew he was Varian Fry. I did not know what his mission
was. I knew that he worked with us, but I didn’t know that he was charged by the
U.S. government, of rescuing famous people. And then he took an office somewhere
in [indecipherable]. The rest is about Varian Fry’s history. But — but that’s — you
have to understand how this layout worked. The Splendide, with the Germans here,
and we were in the building next door, 29 Boulevard d’ Athénes. So, anyway — so I
worked there initially, as the interpreter. And then they got to know me, and I got to
know them, and — but you have to keep in mind, I was 14 years old. I keep telling
my grandkids, who are 25, don’t know how to get their finger out of their ear, what
you can do at 14, if you have to, you know. It’s — was not my choosing.
Q: Yeah.
A: It was fate. And so — so at first, I did some of that all the time, but then there was
a gentleman by the name of Andel(ph) Burns Chalmers, he was a minister,

Protestant minister from the United States, very soft spoken, twice as tall as I was.
And he decided that I was going to work for him. And so —
Q: And he worked in that office, too?
A: Yeah, he was there. Like, he — he was the guy responsible for answering
refugees’ questions, problems. And that included — that included refugees in
concentration camps. So all the correspondence from the concentration camps came
to Mr. Chalmers — Dr. Chalmers. And — so gradually, besides going with Mrs.
Kirschner, Mrs. Kirschner was the wife of the president. The president was
Howard Kirschner.
Q: And he — of the Quaker organization.
A: Yes. He is — he was the big guy, and he had a deputy, whose name was Herbert
Lagler, who was a young American. Kirschner was a very religious man, who had
made a lot of money, and he decided he had to give back. And so he took over
helping refugees in France — Spain and France. And his wife was in charge of all
the children’s colonies. They established children’s colonies, there were a lot of kids
around whose parents had disappeared, and the Quakers took them all in, and — and
set up schools. My stomach is working again, I’m sure you hear.
Q: Okay.
A: And I’m sorry if they’re recording.

A: And he then decided to use me. And he and I sat down and we developed a
questionnaire, which the Germans call a fragebogen. And we developed a
questionnaire of all the questions he had to have answered, in order to be able to
answer the letters he got from the concentration camps, internment camps, whatever.
And I got a letter, which I have. I was charged with going to the American consulate.
Q: Before we get there — before we get to the American consulate, I want to find out
a little bit more about the office. You know, you mentioned a number of people; the
local French hire Dr. Chalmers, I think, yes, the Kirschners. How large was the
office in general? How many employees did it have, approximately?
A: Oh, at least 25. I have a picture of it in — you have the picture tho —
Q: Yeah.
A: The — the — the — there was — there was Howard Kirschner and his wife, and she
was not in the chain of command, but she had a function.
Q: Sure.
A: And Herbert Lagler, who was a deputy. And then there were about four or five
people who were principles, who had different assignments. Chalmers, there was a
gentleman by the name of Stevenson(ph), that only worked with refugees, and how
to help refugees. And I am convinced that there were a couple people in the office
who worked for the underground. There was a guy with a wig, wi-with a cape —
Q: No.

A: Yeah, that came in all the time. He had a red wig, and with this cape. His name
was Jean-Julien Chapenoire(ph). He was French, and I am sure he was part of the
underground. I just never figured that he could be anything else. He didn’t ha — he —
he didn’t have a office in the office, but he was there, a lot of the time. Then they
had subsidiaries near the camps, at Toulouse and a couple place. But, I have a
picture I’Il show you, after we get off the air here, of a meeting of the Quakers that —
where they took a picture of everybody. And there were secretaries, of course.
Everybody had a secretary, an assistant, to do all the paperwork, because most of
what they did was paperwork.
Q: And were most of the — aside from the secretary who — the receptionist, were
most everybody American?
A: Most were American, but there were some British, there were some — a Swede or
two. There — there were some pretty famous names in there. There — there were
people from western Europe who were in that sphere of social activity, support,
whatever.
Q: Were they all Quaker?
A: I doubt it.
Q: Okay. Tell me — you mentioned earlier that you found them remarkable. What
was — what were — what were some of the things that struck you that way, about the
Quakers?

A: Well, they — they were all very kind people.
Q: Okay.
A: They had a — they had a — I’m not convinced that they were all Quakers. The —
some of them were Unitarians, Mennonites, and so on. And — but they had a meeting
every Sunday morning — a Quaker meeting every Sunday morning. I’m not sure that
Howard Kirschner was a Quaker, but he was a religious person, very religious.
They had a meeting every Sunday morning in the — in the conference room, where —
that I was privileged to attend. Where I didn’t understand half of what was going on,
but because that was — we were now at a higher intellectual level. And they did — the
meeting room were about twice as big as this, and — and it consisted of chairs a-
along the wall. No table. All the way on the outside. And people would come in and
sit down, and nobody would say anything, until somebody would speak up, and
present some thoughts about some issue. Very highly philosophical, or — or what
they saw that week, or whatever. And then they’d sit down — not sit down, they
never got up — and they would stop, and then be a silence, and then somebody else
would pick up, and so that —
Q: Did they talk — would they respond to the first statement, or would they then say
their own?
A: Yeah. I don’t remember all the details, but they — they — it was not — it was not
coordinated any way, it was all on the spur of the moment, the spirit of it. And it

inspiring, it was very beautiful.
Q: I—I-—Td like to understand — make sure that I understand it better.
Q2: Now might be a good time to pause for lunch.
Q: I—I—I know, but I want to finish this one question, is — if it’s possible. Okay.
When somebody would say something, and they finished, would then there be a
discussion from others, that would revolve around that topic, or — or not?
A: I can’t answer that any more.
Q: Okay.

off from where the first one left off.
Q: Okay.

Q: That’s one of the question —
A: It was just a presentation of thoughts, which may have been, or may not have
been related to what the first person said.

Q: Thank you very — [break] Okay, before the break, we were talking about your
work, the work that you were starting to — to do with the Quaker organization in
Marseilles, and how you ended up working with Dr. Chalmers. And tell me now
how that developed, and what — how it took you from their offices to the offices of
the U.S. consulate in Marseilles. Describe that to me.
A: Yeah, the — a-as Dr. Chalmers and I got to know each other better, and he was
overwhelmed, because the number of people in these camps that wrote to him, was
very, very large. And so he got a great number of — of letters every day, with people
pleading for assistance to save their life by getting an American visa, if they could.
The — he felt that I knew enough about things, and — so that he appointed me to be
his leg-man, his messenger, if you wish — it was more than a messenger, a messenger
is an understatement — to the American consulate, to answer the question, which
basically amounted to, what’s the status of my papers, and pos-possibility to get a
visa to the United States, from every one of these people that wrote. So he and I
devised a questionnaire so I could quickly go through files and — and fill out the
blanks, and so he could answer the letters.
Q: Okay.
A: So they — they — they — they gave me — they gave me a letter, which I — to present
to the guard at the American consulate. After a few times, the guard knew me, so I
didn’t need the letter, but initially saying that I was the representative of the

Quakers, and I could have access to the consulate. And so I started going to the
consulate, I would say twice a week, to do this. Number one, it wasn — it wasn’t easy
to get into the consulate, for normal human beings. There was a line of people
around the block to get into the American consulate, to see a representative of the
consulate, to find out the status of their papers, if they were able to do this. What I
was handling is the people who weren’t able to come to the consulate.
Q: Can you describe the consulate building physically, like you did the Quaker
building, next to Hotel Splendide? What did — where was it, and so —
A: It’s —1t’s — it’s —1t’s one block from the police prefecture, which — in the middle
of town, which is a mammoth building. And there’s a square, I don’t remember the
name of the square. I can tell you that today, the — which is not your question, but
today the consulate’s moved up about 10 buildings, and has a square, and the address
of the square is Place Varian Fry, which I think is an interesting little thing that
nobody’ll tell you, unless you go there and you see it. But they were on a middle of a
block, with mammoth oak door, it was an old office building. Or it could have been
a private home, with a fairly large number of rooms 1n it, then you went in from the
street, up some steps, and then you were inside the consulate.
Q: So there was no — it wasn’t such that it was a building that had a yard around it,
and then a wall, or a gate, and you were —
A: No.

Q: Okay.
A: — it was part of a — because it came out of peace time, it was still the same thing it
had been before, in peacetime, where people just went to a consulate, like you go to
any office building. Well, there was a sm — relatively small building, but it was
attached on both sides, to other buildings.
Q: And did the U.S. consulate have the entire building to itself, or only certain
floors?
A: To this — to this building, yes.
Q: The whole building?
A: Yeah.
Q: And about how li— how many stories did it have?
A: I believe not more than two.
Q: Oh, I see.
A: It was not a— it was more a spread out building, and deep building, than it was a
high building.

worked there, at the time?

A: No, I don’t —I can’t tell you that. I — because I only related with certain people. I
related to the people in the consulate division. A consulate has other functions. Like
the con — I never saw the consul general, not that I would — I wanted to. He was not a
very nice guy, I’m told. But I only dealt with the consular staff, the people that
handed — handled the people applying for visa, or it could have been Americans who
came in, to have a stamp put in their passport. But that was the one section of the —
the consulate, overall, that I dealt with.
Q: Okay. Again, to — for — for me to be able to get a picture of this, there are people
who are standing outside with a line winding around a square, or you know, they’re
waiting for a long time. And — and if they’re coming on their own to see — to find out
the status of their application. When you go in, do you go to the same window that
they would go, except that yours is streamlined, that is you are able to not have to
wait in line? Or, is it that you don’t have to stand by a window, you’re actually
admitted to a place beyond a counter, that normal people wouldn’t be able to get to?
A: The latter. I— once I got past the guard, I was on my own.
Q: Oh, okay.
A: I went in the building to the section where the consular department was, and they
had this mammoth file room. You could call it a conference room. It had a big, big,
long oaken table in the middle, and the rest of the room were file cabinets, all the
way again — against the wall, all the way around —

A: — around the table. And so, I went in there, I didn’t ask anybody for anything, I
just went in, and I put my briefcase and my files on the table. And the files were
organized alphabetically. So I started at A, and worked my way around. And you
know, I had my — my request letters also in alphabetical order, so I could work my
way in some kind of orderly fashion, to look up the files of the people whose
requests I had.
Q: Was there anybody else from the consular office in the room at the time?
A: No.
Q: Wow.
A: It was me in charge.
Q: Wow.
A: It’s — it’s — when you think about it, especially nowadays, you know, I worked in
embassies and consulates later in life, it — it was totally inconceivable. It was that I —
and you know, as I say, I was a 15 year old boy — that I was — I had this access. Once
I was inside, I was free to in — within the consular section, not the whole consulate —
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: —I don’t — didn’t get involved there. But I just went in there and did my job.
Q: But nevertheless though, I mean, these are important files —
A: Of course.

Q: — you know, and very vital to the people who are requesting.
A: Life and death.
Q: Yeah.
A: And the — the — you know, and every time I went in there, I also looked under
Hockenheimer.
Q: I wanted to ask you that.
A: And see oh, has anything come in from the last time, you know, from our
relatives.
Q: Now, when your family put together your request, who did you approach to be
your sponsors in the United States?
A: Oh, in the United States? Well, there were two. There was my mother’s sister,
Elsa(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph), who had only been in the United States since
1939, I believe, so they weren’t that well established in 1940 — ’41. But he was a
businessman, and so he gave us what was required, probably still is, an affidavit.
And then my mother’s brother Walter, Walter Lowen(ph), he changed his name
from Lowenthal to Lowen(ph), he lived in Seattle, and he gave us another
statement. What they wanted is a statement saying we would not become wards of
the state. That’s really what it amounted to. And so we had these, and the — the — the
— the consulate ha — the consul, in charge of consul affairs had to — had to decide
whether it was enough, or not, semicolon; the policy in Washington was not to give

any visas. Cordell Hull was Secretary of State, and he had a sidekick who was
worse, and their policy was not to give visas to refugees. Jewish refugees, I can’t tell
you exactly, but that was the policy. The — the consul general in Marseilles, whose
name just came to my mind, was Fullerton. Mr. Fullerton was abiding by these
instructions, and on his staff he had vice-consul Hiram Bingham, and who had a
sidekick whose name was Miles Standish. If you want to be American, you can’t
get more American than Hiram Bingham and Miles Standish. And they were on
their own. They, on their own, decided. They met the refugees. Miles Standish and
Bingham went to Saint Nicolas camp, and — and got the Lion Feuchtwanger out
while he was washing himself at the creek, a-and they — they — they had a taxi
standing nearby. They — they quickly changed him into a woman, and had him sit in
the back of the seat. And when the police stopped the taxi, they said, who is that in
the back? Oh, that’s my mother-in-law from Georgia, and the taxi waved them on.
He was an American consul, so they thought he had some authority. And that’s how
they got him out of there, but you could have access to — to Saint Nicolas, in
Niemes. But anyway, it — Hiram Bingham worked with Varian Fry, they met
secretly in places, to exchange information on getting the people that Eleanor
Roosevelt wanted out. How to figure out how to get them passport, and get them on
a boat, or another boat, over the mountains, into Spain, or whatever. There were —

Q: So, I mean — I mean — of course, Eleanor Roosevelt was not part of the —
formally a part of the U.S. government. However, as the wife of the president, she’s
clearly has interests that are in contradiction to Mr. Hull, you know —
A: Oh yeah.
Q: — at the State department.
A: Yeah.
Q: So it sounds —
A: But she was a power.
Q: Yes.
A: Eleanor Roosevelt was a power unto herself, and nobody would have challenged
— Cordell lul — Hull would not have challenged Eleanor Roosevelt. So this is the
kind of stuff that you — you know, put a blind eye on it. But — but what Hiram
Bingham did, you know, was spectacular, because he issued 2,500 visas to people
without permission from — from Washing —
Q: Now, wasn’t that risking getting into a lot of hot water?
A: Oh yeah, he did. He got into a lot of hot water. He — we left in May of ’41, in
June of ’41, they — they canned him. They pulled him out. Some people knew about
him, and complained to Vichy. We had an American ambassador in Vichy, Admiral
Leahy, and somebody got at him. He was no particular wonderful person, and they —
they put pressure on him, and they — they pulled him out and send him first to

I don’t know what they did exactly, but they — he retired, or quit the foreign service
because they made life so miserable for him, and never got another job.
Q: Within the government, or —
A: Yes.
Q: So he did pay a stiff price.
A: Yeah, he — he was — as a result, he was kicked out of the government. But he sa —
had saved 2,500 people. He was a very tall man, he had 11 children. He — he
followed his conscience.
Q: Did you have interaction with him?
A: Yes. One time, I — maybe more, but I remember one time, the — in — in March,
approximately, of ’41, Mr. Chalmers — Dr. Chalmers said to me one day, I have —
had you — as you know, I live with Hiram Bingham — which I didn’t know — and we
spoke last night, and he said next time you are at the consulate, drop in to see him.
And as you can well imagine, I went to the consulate the next day. I didn’t let any
grass grow under my feet. And there I had to, you know, ask — there was a Miss
Houligan(ph), who was kind of the administrative person there, she was a nice
person. And I told her that Hiram Bingham wanted to see me, and so she took me
in to see him. And he said to me, you know, th-the Quakers highly recommend you
and your family. I — I know your dad is at Gurs, and we’re ready to issue you visas.

But if you issue a visa, it’s only good for 90 days, and — but your dad is at Gurs, so
we first have to get your dad out of Gurs before I advise that you get a vise,
otherwise, it might run out before you get to the United States, and you have to start
from scratch. And so he — he — he said, I’m giving you a letter, addressed to the
commandant at — at Gurs, whoever’s in charge, and saying — on American si —
consulate stationery, saying that we’re prepared to issue your family a visa, and the
chances are 50-50 that they’ll let him go. And so — and then, you come back. And so
we — we — he gave me the letter, we sent it to Dad, they let him out.
Q: But I want to stop right here. I can’t imagine what you must have felt like when
you heard those words. I mean, out of so many years of uncertainty.
A: You have to remember, I was 15 years old. At 15, you don’t go into all the
possible angles. All that mattered to me is that the American consulate was going to
give us a visa to get out. That — th-that, you know. And you can imagine how my
mother felt. And so, you know, and that came —
Q: How did she — how did she react when you told her?
A: Well, she was — well, you — honestly, you didn’t believe any of it until after it
happened. That — you know, I'll give you an example in a second. The — the — so we
get — Dad came back, so we had to get out, okay? So the debate became, how do you
get out? You could — you had two options; you could go through Spain. There was a
guy by the name of Francisco Franco there, who could have caused you a hard

time, you didn’t know. Or, you could take a ship from Marseilles to the West
Indies. Now, there weren’t that many ships, but th-they — there were some. And so
we decided okay, so we worked, from the point of view, when was our ship going?
And so, there was a ship on the sixth of May, the Winnipeg, and there was a ship on
the 10" of May, the Wyoming. And so, you had to get ship’s passage, which wasn’t
a given. You needed an exit visa from France, and you needed a transit visa for the
French West Indies, and you needed ship’s passage. And so we started working on
that. The Quakers, the — Herbert Lagler, the number two guy at the Quakers, called
the president of the French line, and said, we have four members of our staff — note
the — the wording — who are ready to go to the States, we need four bunks, passages,
whatever. And the president — they didn’t start at the bottom, they went to the
president of the French line. And the president of the French line said, we — we have
no more cabins. And Herbert Lagler said, well, our staff members will take any
accommodation. Which meant the hold of the ship, because these ships were not
passenger ships, they had ca — they were freighters with some cabins. And so they
had turned the — the hold into receptacles for human beings. And say — our quo — our
members will — will take whatever you got. So, okay. So — I’m stepping si-sideway
here.

A: And we — they sent me as a messenger from the Quakers, to the French line,
called the Messageries Maritimes, to pick up the tickets and give him a check. And
—and I got the tickets, and he said, who are you? I’m the messenger of the Quakers,
okay? So I had my four tickets, which turned out to — well, I’ll get to that. And then
we had to get the papers from the French police prefecture, for exit visa and the
transit visa. And this is where the story always gets me, is that we knew that on the
second floor of the house, the apartment house we lived in, there was a lady, middle-
aged lady, who lived with her aunt and uncle, they were Corsicans. They were called
Giglielmi(ph) Morachini(ph). And we knew her — them — we didn’t know her aunt
and uncle at all, but — and I can’t tell you whether her name was Giglielmi(ph), or
Morachini(ph). But, be that as it may. And — but we knew she worked for the
French police prefecture. So my mother and I went, rang her doorbell. And all we
knew about her was from saying, bonjour Madame, as we went higher up than she
lived, as she came out the door. And we said, Madame, we understand that you work
at the police prefecture, and this is our situation. We have visa for the United States,
we're leaving, we need a French exit visa, and transit visa, and can you help us with
that? She said yes. And she said, I will bring you the papers tomorrow, to fill out. So,
she — next day we saw her, and she — she gave us some questionnaires to fill out, and
we filled them out. Rang her doorbell, and said, here are the papers. Okay, I will let
you know when I get the answer. Few days later she contacted us, and she said, the

papers are ready, and — but you have to go pick them up yourself, because you have
to get a stamp, and they — they put — paste the stamp on there, like a postage stamp,
but it’s a fee, or whatever. So I went there, and I picked up the papers, and again
they asked me who I was, and I said, I’m the messenger. And I gave them the money
they wanted, and you know, they don’t ask 15 year old kids much. You — you’ ve — if
I had been 25, it would have been different, but I wasn’t.
Q: Sometimes that’s lucky.
A: Yeah. Well, that’s what — my whole life has been like that. And I-I—I-I ga—-
so I wound up with the — with the French exit visas, and with the transit visa for the
— for the Martinique. And — and you have to ask yourself the question, is why did
she do that?
Q: Yeah.
A: She was a nice lady, she knew us for years, she knew whe — we were nice people,
good neighbors. She didn’t know any — a thing about us, otherwise. And she spoke
from her conscience. And every time I tell this story, I have a hard time telling it,
because it was such a unexpected thing, that came out of — you know. It’s just — it’s a
human — it was a human gesture that — that just transcends anything you can say
about anything. And so we had all that, and then we — we had a — we had to get rid
of all our furniture. And so we did that, I don’t remember how, my parents did that.
And my mother — my dad said, before we got the tickets, my dad said, Winnipeg on

the sixth of May, Wyoming on the 10" of May. We ought to take the Wyoming, it’]]
give us four more days to get everything taken care of. And that’s the one time in my
life that I heard my mother said, over my dead body. I don’t know how you say that
in German, but she said, over my dead body, we’re leaving on the sixth of May. And
so, on the sixth of May — now, we did take some things along. My sister and I don’t
know how there’s — if you go around the corner here, there’s a mammoth oil painting
of the Bavarian Alps in there. That came out with us. We have no idea how they did
that, absolutely no idea.
Q: Maybe they rolled it up.
A: They’re free — their — no.
Q: No.
A: It was — it was like this.
Q: In a frame?
A: There were three di — there are three more paintings. There’s a naked lady down
the hall, she was part of it, and my sister has two oil paintings, and — and then a
bunch of books, that was it. Kultur.

A: You can always get furniture, but paintings and — and so — anyway, so Winnipeg
it was, and the Quakers picked us up in the staff car, American Friend Service
Committee on it. They took us to the pier, to the — to the gangplank, and there was
the German with the swastika. You know, it — it always just to keep you from
whatever.
Q: Just from being too sure.
A: And he checked everybody that got up there. They were looking for people that
were on their list. Wi— thank God, we were not important enough, so we were not
on their list, so we got up there. But they did arrest a — a few people there. The wife
of a former member of Parliament, and a few people like that. And so then,
Winnipeg took off, sixth of May. We went from Marseilles to Oran in Algeria, did
not dock. Then we turned west, to Gibraltar, we went through Gibraltar to
Casablanca. We stopped in Casablanca. We were able to touch the soil, I’ve — I’ve
touched the soil of Africa. And —
Q: Did you see Humphrey Bogart?

connections in — in Casa, and because it was her birthday, he got a message to them,
and the guy came on a motorcycle, to bring her some strawberries. She was

supposed to get whipped cream, but he said it was too hot, and the whipped cream
would be sour. So I’ve been giving my sister strawberries and whipped cream ever
since then, every year. But, so then we left —
Q: How lovely.
A: — we left Casa, and went down along North Africa, down to Dakar, but did not
touch. Dakar is right on the equator. And we went across the equator to the West
Indies. Now, the day before we got to Martinique — actually, a night and a half
before we got to Martinique, it was so damn hot in the ship — there are lots of things
about the ship that I’ll spare you, but it was so hot, there was no way I could stay
down — down in the — in the hold. I mean, you — you just — you suffocated. And I —
about midnight I went up on deck, and I — just to get some air, just to breathe. And I
became aware of several things. One of them was that it was pitch black. The sea
was totally calm, there was no wave going on. But then I dis-discovered, or decided
that the ship wasn’t really moving. I said oh, what’s going on here? And I went and I
looked and talked to some people, and we were just sitting there. And then all of a
sudden, from all sides, we were lit up in — 1n lights, as the focal point, and some —
some rope ladders were thrown up on the ship, and a bunch of characters came up,
and we couldn’t tell who they were. They had no uniform on, they wore blue jeans,
or whatever, and they all had weapons. And they spoke a language which I didn’t

what they were talking. And so they took us over, they cap —
Q: But what did they look like?
A: — they captured us. And —
Q: Pirates?
A: No. They — they were — they were — they were Dutch, of the wild Dutch army in
exile, the — the free Dutch, who had gone to England, and they captured us on
behalf of the — on behalf of the British, and they took us to the French — to the
British to trade that, at the British West Indies.
Q: Well, so what flag was the Winnipeg flying under?
A: Well, that — that — that is very cogent question, because we didn’t know who they
were, but in the morning when we got daylight, I looked at the flag, and the flag
wasn’t tricolor any more, it was orange, which represented the House of Orange-
Nassau of the Netherlands. And so they took us in, they took us to Port of Spain,
Trinidad, and they had captured us. Of course, we had some French soldiers aboard,
going to Martinique as replacements, or whatever. And then the — the — the radio
operator barricaded himself in the thing, and he called in the French for whatever,
and the — one ef — one airplane came, and somebody — they didn’t do anything, they
just took us to Trinidad.

Q: But what a footnote. I mean, everything that we know about World War II is that
the French, and the British were allies. And here —
A: Not after Vichy, this was Vichy.
Q: Uh-huh, okay. These were Vichy —
A: This was a Vichy ship.
Q: A Vichy ship.
A: I’m sorry I didn’t say that. A Vichy ship, it was flying under the Vichy flag,
going to Martinique, which was under the con — control of Vichy. Now, the reason
I understand they did it — [phone ringing, break]
Q: So, Vichy.
A: Yeah.
Q: Vichy and Martinique.
A: Yeah. And they — they took us to Trinidad, which was British, and the reason
they did it, I’m told, is that the Germans, Rommel in North Africa had — had given
the Nazis the rights to use airports in Syria. Haven’t you heard of Syria before? And
as a countermeasure, the — the British decided a — hey, you think we can’t do
anything? So the British decided to — okay, as punishment, they decided to sh —
decided to seize a Vichy French ship. The — we happened to be on board. The reason
this is so important about the — the — the Winnipeg and the Wyoming, is because
when the Winnipeg was captured, the Wyoming, four days behind us, was off the

coast of Africa, coming across the equator. And when — and when this happened,
when the Winnipeg was captured, the Wyoming was turned around, back to Africa,
so he wouldn’t be captured, and the people who were in the Wyoming spent the rest
of the war in — in — in Senegal, some of them working on the Trans-Sahara rail
line.
Q: Your mother was so right.
A: Not one more day.
Q: Wow.
A: Every day — when you get in a situation like this, don’t delay anything, because
you never know what’s changing tomorrow.

the alternative would have been, we wa — would have wound up in Africa.
Q: Now, Winnipeg and Wyoming are not French names.
A: No, but ships can have —

Q: Okay. So what happened to you when you were in Trinidad? How did things
develop?
A: Well, the — the people of Trinidad had — were told that the British had captured
the German warship, which we were not. And so half of Trinidad was out on the
pier, trying to see what these Germans looked like, and of course, it was women and
children. And the British were very nice. They put us in a camp, but the camp was
nicely organized. They fed us, and whatever. And to the extent that they even
produced buses to take us on a tour of Port of Spain.
Q: Really.
A: So it — it was no hardship post. And so what we — but what we needed to do, you
see, because our trip was arranged for us to take a ship out of Martinique to New
York, it was all paid for. And we weren’t in Martinique, so we couldn’t take a ship
from Martinique to New York. So we had to start from scratch on that, but we were
safe.
Q: Yeah.
A: And so my mother contacted her sister, Elsie(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph) in
Cincinnati, and they — they booked passages for us from Trinidad to — to New
York on the luxury liner called the SS Uruguay, which came from South America,

know, we — dining — air conditioned dining room, waiters with gloves, silver trays. I
mean, how — how can — you know, you have to ask yourself, where the hell did that
come from, you know?
Q: Yeah.
A: It was a little difficult, because there was a tropical storm —
Q: Okay.
A: — that hit us. When my mother and my sister went on the — on the Uruguay
without a problem, then my dad and I were behind, getting the luggage, and
accompanying the luggage. And when we went from — from Port of Spain, that —
the Uruguay was too big to come into the harbor. It had to sit outside. And —
Q: So you had to go by boat?
A: And — or a little boat, one puff-pu-pu-pu — little one-horsepower motor. And there
were about, I don’t know, 20 people on this thing. It was a little cabin with a — with
the guy in charge, the pilot. And we didn’t all fit in. There was a young doctor, by
the name of Dr. Hirschberg(ph) — I just saw his name yesterday, somewhere. He
and I were outside, and our job was, when the cyclone hit us, to — you know, these
little boats have tires on the side, so that when they hit something else —

Q: Right.
A: And so every time a wave came, he would throw the tire on — on the deck, and
Hirschberg(ph) or I would throw the tire back out in the water, you know. So when
we got to the — to the Uruguay, they had a platform at the bottom, with a gangplank,
and this thing would come to the gangplank, and they — they said jump. I says, I’m
not gonna jump. I was soaking wet, I had water in my shoes. I was soaked, you
know? Every wave had gone over my head. Said, I’m not jumping, because if I slip,
the thing’1l come back and I’1l fall between, it’Il crush me. I said, I— I’m not
jumping. My mother was up there looking down. She recognized me. And the
captain was standing next to her, and she started screaming, and the captain said,
what’s going on. She said, that’s my son, that’s my son. And he sent down some
sailors on the platform, and one of them jumped on our little boat, and the other one
held the rope, and the one held me until I was on the —

into there, you go into air conditioned spaces, with white gloves and silverware, and
first class, and all of that.

A: Thank you.
Q: Okay. [break] So, you come into New York harbor, and you’re met by family,
relatives there. Tell me how — what happened then. Where did you folks go, where
did you settle?
A: Well, the — basically, my family settled in New York. However, the same aunt
and uncle in Cincinnati I’ve talked about, Elsa(ph) and Charlie Heiman(ph),
invited me to come stay with them for a while, until my parents got settled. And so, I
moved to — to Cincinnati. My mother and sister went with me, and dropped me off
wer — and stayed a little bit. My grandmother was there. They all lived in the same
little court. And I spent 15 months, approximately, in Cincinnati. I graduated high
school, at 16, in Cincinnati. Decided I’d learned everything I would ever learn. The
only thing they made me take is a course in civics. I had to be in a — good American,
so I —I took that, and American history, two courses. Then I graduated high school,
and then I — I started at the University of Cincinnati. I — I worked during the day, I

A: Pardon?
Q: What were you doing?
A: Oh, I was working as a si — first I was working as an errand boy for an optical
company on a bicycle. And I went over from Cincinnati to Covington and
Newport, Kentucky every day. And then I decided that was too cold in winter, or
something, and I got a job as a stock clerk in a — in a textile company. When I got
bored of that, I got a job as a stock boy in a toy company. Those were the three jobs I
had, and I went to school at night, while I was there. And then, in October of ’42, a
re — the connection there was that my — my aunt and uncle had a son who was — who
was nine months younger than I am, and so he and I were buddies, and he taught me
all about America. He’d been there all of two years. A-And the — and he and I are
great friends to this day. Then I went to New York, and my uncle was always sure I
needed a job to earn money. You know, that’s the way he operated. He was no big
intellectual, he was — and kind of frowned upon by that part of the family, because
all we wanted to do, my sister and I, was go to college. And that wasn’t necessary, in
order to make money. So — but in New York I worked first for a textile company,
that he probably got me the job. And then — and then I decided I could do better
things. I went to school at night. I went to city college in New York at night, and
played soccer on the weekends, in the French sporting club, and became quickly —

well, from the beginning, even in Cincinnati, I was totally — you have to understand,
that having had the experience that I had with the Quakers, I was not a normal kid. I
had the war — the war weighed very heavily on my — on my personality, and I
couldn’t see where all these people were — people were sitting around and having a
good time, when there were people dying in — in Europe and nobody was helping
them. And so I was getti — got involved in — in — even in Cincinnati I joined the
Alliance Frangaise, and tried to get people interested in what’s going on in Europe,
and we can’t just —
Q: What is the Alliance Francaise?
A: It’s — it’s a cultural — it’s a cultural —
Q: French?
A: But French. And they had speakers. And since there were a lot of Frenchmen in
exile at that point, they had speakers relating to the — to the war. The — Ron sent me
a bunch of — of documents from the Quakers, which — which — that — which included
letters that I wrote from Cincinnati to the Quakers, asking them for certain actions,
and do that, and do this, and do that. And — you know, normally no organization
would pay attention to what a 15 year old has to say, but I — I just was — I couldn’t
get that out of my system. So when I got to New York, besides everything else, I
quickly got involved politically in the — with the f — free French youth, the — the de
Gaulle’s youth. That was a great de Gaulle’s — anything to fight the Nazis.

Q: Did you sign up, were you drafted? How did that occur?
A: It worked like this, that I couldn’t — I couldn’t volunteer before I was 18, because
I was not a citizen. That’s the way I remember it. But on my 18" birthday, I went to
the draft board and say hey, here I am. And they took only six weeks to —

what was going on, and here I was free, and now the other people were dying over
there. So that really was — it really worked on me. I wanted to join the free French
forces, and my dad said, if you do, you never have to come back to my house. And
of course, you have to understand, he had been — what he had gone through, between
the jail and the — and Les Milles and Gurs, there were part of his — part of his brain

A: And so I understand that, but s — but I — I joined the army, basically right after I

me to —I was a radio operator — they send me to radio school in Oklahoma for four
months, because I was so good at that, they were going to use me. And then they
send me back to — then they assign me to an artillery outfit back in Fort Bragg,
North Carolina. And that’s when I decided enough was enough, this was stupid, the
army didn’t know what it was doing, and I — I was fluent in French and German, I
wasn’t doing anybody any good in the South Pacific as — as a radio operator in a
heavy artillery outfit. And so on — I — after Oklahoma they gave me a leave, on the
way to North Carolina. And as only, you know, you have to be determined, but
what could they do to me? I was a private, they couldn’t demote me. So I — when I —

He said, well — he went somewhere, then he came back, said well, you know, the —

good as his word.
Q: How long did it take?
A: Oh, four, six weeks at the most. I was on duty at night — duty, on guard duty at
night, and the first sergeant ne — had never paid any attention to me, came to my post
in the middle of nowhere somewhere. And he said, Ho-Hockley, I — you gotta come

then he said, well, we got classified orders from Washington that you have to leave
right away. And of course, I knew what it was all about, but I didn’t admit it. And so

Q: Of that visit.
A: — that. I ha — one thing I want to interject is that they had a policy then — when I
finished basic training, which was in May of ’44, as I finished basic training, I
became an American citizen. There was a policy there that they wouldn’t send you —
they couldn’t send you overseas, like Germany especially, if you weren’t an
American citizen, because if the Germans caught you, they could string you up, you
know. Which, I wish they had that policy now, because they don’t do it. They — they
have guys get who killed fighting for the United States that are not citizens, which
is totally unacceptable in my book.
Q: So when did you go from Hockenheimer to Hockley”
A: When I became a citizen.
Q: And —
A: And that was before the su — the super — Superior court, Cumberland county,
North Carolina. And there was an application that I wanted to change my name.
Because my nickname had always been Rudy, r-u-d-i or y, depending where I was —
I initially, and Y in France. They — which they pronounce, Ru-dee(ph). And I
decided, you know, I might as well change my name from Rudolf. Martin was the
middle name, Martin Hockley. I mean hock — Rudolf Martin Hockenheimer to —
my application was to Rudy Martin Hockley. And the judge looked down over his

taken in life. But so I— in May of — of ’44, I became an American citizen.

A: My first wife called me Ralph.
Q: Really?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: But Caroline doesn’t like Ralph, and women have the tendency of not liking
what other women — what for-former wives wanted. And so she decided I wasn’t a
Ralph to her, and she calls me Rudy.
Q: Okay.
A: I can’t pronounce either, so it doesn’t make any difference.
Q: Okay, so you’re a citizen. May 1944, you’re a citizen. You get these classified
orders, and you end up in Camp Ritchie. Tell us, what is Camp Ritchie?

A: Camp Ritchie, Maryland was established, I believe in 1942, when they found
that the army in — in Europe — of course, we hadn’t landed yet, but we were in
North Africa, that they — that they needed linguists very bad. Do you mind if I — I —
I can lean my leg down here.
Q: Okay.
A: I— and so, they developed this forum, cal-called the intelligence training center,
Camp Ritchie, Maryland, which is 65 miles north of Washington, and 65 miles
west of Baltimore.
Q: Okay.
A: In the mountains up there. And they — they taught — well, languages you knew,
but they had all kinds of odd characters there, from PhDs to privates like me.
Anybody who knew any languages, they — they got there, and they trained them in
such things as prisoner of war interrogation, just military intelligence analysis, order
of battle. Order of battle is try to get complete records of the organization of the
enemy military, so that if you knew that the second Panzer division was coming at
you, you knew that the commanding general had to be so and so, and you n — you
built up records to know the weaknesses and the strengths of the commanders, and
things like that. And then the big one, prisoner of war interrogation was a very big
one. They they —
Q: Did you have training in all of those different topics?

they first started me in French. They decided, you know, that came first. Germany
was afterwards. So they trained me in French MII, French Military Intelligence
Interrogation. And then they — they shifted me to — when we didn’t need people in
France any more, they shifted me to — to German. And they — and then they — they
put me through — yeah, first they — when the French was over, they put me in the
aerial photo interpretation, which didn’t make any sense, because that’s not what I
was there for. And so then they — they made me work in the officers’ mess for — after
I graduated the basic course, which is general in nature, they — they had me work in
the officers’ mess for a few months. I’m very good at pots and pans. And I — and
then they suddenly — somebody pushed a button and they say oh, but he knows
German. [indecipherable] So they gave me a two week blitz course, we called it, in

things like that. The aggressor, it was called. And so they had some exercises where
we had to do certain things, they — they also send us out at night for a whole week,
through Maryland and Pennsylvania pig farms, where if you went over the fence at
night, you stepped on a pig, and then it ran away squealing. And — and they — they
gave us — they gave us a map, which was not in English, and they made us find our
way back, which was interesting. But, so there was general kind of training of what
you might encounter in a combat situation. Then in — they — I’ve — I stayed there
forever, and March of ’45, which was two months before the end of the war, they
finally shipped us overseas, and —
Q: Before we go there, a question at two different periods of time. Before you joined
the army, you said you were — you were very engaged, and wanted to know what
was going on, you — you know, your — your mind was over with the people who
were in Europe, who were under threat, and who were suffering. And so, were —
was there news of what was happening to the Jews? Was there re — were there
reports of what was going on?
A: Well, we knew what was going on, but the question of at what point we knew
about death camps —
Q: And deportations to them, yeah.

France, a lot of Frenchmen were shipped to — not Jew —

A: Well, the ship — the ship docked in Scotland, and they put — we were — went on
the Ile de France, which was the largest ship floating around, which outraced any
submarine, so that we went without escort. And we never saw the ship until we got
off it. It was so big, they made us go in the side of the hold in New York, and you
never saw where you are in this thing. You couldn’t see the front or the back of it.
But once we got off in — in Scotland — come back — then you could see the whole
ship, and then they se — put us on the train, and they took us to Southampton, all the
way down to the bottom. And then they took us over to France. And in France they
first send us to some replacement depot for a short time. And then —I was — I and my
group of people, there were a few of us, were sent to a villa outside of Paris, in Le
Vésinet, which was, for Europe, the — the intelligence assignment center. And I was
— I was picked up from there by a colonel who was part of the staff of the Bremen
port command. They were planning to open the port of Bremerhaven for allied
troops, when the war was over. And so that’s where that started. I was in Paris — I

A: — when the war ended, and you know — when the punishment for being in Paris
on eight of May °45, and you were in American uniform, and you walked down the
Champs Elysée, I got caught in a — it’s just funny — I got caught in a circle of
French women, with a lieutenant colonel of the air force, who was 23 years old, and
the two of us could only escape after we kissed them all. I mean, what duty —
Q: Oh, what a punishment.
A: — what duty. But then immediately thereafter, I guide — I guided a bunch to go up
to — to Bremen, because I spoke French and German.
Q: Okay.
A: And that was the purpose of that exercise.
Q: So was this the — when you went there, that’s the first time you’re back on
German soil, for a decade.

there about the 10" of May, ’45.
Q: So, do you recall any kind of feelings that were running through you at that time,
or were there — was it, I got a job, I’m gonna go do this job, and —
A: Interesting question. I had feelings. I hated all Germans at the point — at that
point. Germany was basically on its knees. It was 65 percent destroyed in most
places, not in all places, but we drove up to Bremen, all the way through Germany,
west — West Germany. And every city we came to was as flat as a pancake. In order

to get a truck to get through Kassel, Germany, you had to have a bulldozer in front
of you to push the rubble aside, so that the truck could go through. And Bremen wa
— we went to, was 65 percent destroyed. And the Germans that were there, they
kicked them out of the houses, so they could house us. And I don’t know where they
went. Some — sometimes they stayed in the basement. But the — I — my motto was to
keep my distance. They had a fraternization — non-fraternization order that you
couldn’t associate socially with G.I.s, which didn’t last very long. The order lasted,
but the factual part of it didn’t last very long. And — but I personally, you know,
there are a few things that happened that — or some — I was pretty well known,
because every German that worked for us had to go ba — past me to get a security
clearance, and se-security pass. So everybody who worked for the Americans, knew
me. And so they established a — we established for the G.I.s, you had to do
something, in their spare time, whatever that was, they established a club called the
Shangri-La, and — which was — and you were permitted to take girls there, because
they had music, you could dance.
Q: But you can’t fraternize with them.
A: Yeah. And I —I was approached there by — it wasn’t immediately, but a few
months later by one young lady that knew me, and she came over to my table, and
she said — I don’t know what she called me, Mr. Hockley, or Corporal Hockley — I

was a corporal by then. The — I noticed that you never sit with anybody else except
G.I.s, and you don’t dance, and so on.
Q: In other words, you don’t fraternize.
A: And I said, look, I don’t want to discuss it. I— I — my family — you know, there
was the whole story, my family was treated very badly by the Germans, and I don’t —
I don’t have to associate socially. And so she broke out in tears. Then her boyfriend
came over and — and chewed me out for making his girlfriend cry. But th — you
know, every German you met in 1945 had a cousin in the United States.
Q: Is that so?
A: The — that was the way of getting — there are a lot of people that fraternized, all
the way up the line. Not just the privates, and so on, the officers, too. It was a policy
condemned to failure. But for me, it was fine. I didn’t go there to become friends
with anybody. I was very fair in everything I did. I didn’t mistreat anybody, I just
did my job, and that was it. But I didn’t want to — there’s no way that I could socially
be active with Germans, if I didn’t know who they were. And that —
Q: What was your job? Besa — you said you had to —
A: Well —
Q: — they had to clear — you were the first point of security?
A: Well, the first thing is the colonel — the colonel that picked me up was the fellow
in charge of intelligence for the Bremen port command. So he was the G2

intelligence officer, and I was on his staff. And the intelligence office had to issue
security passes, as much as you could check anybody. We had a big headquarters
that was in the middle of town. The air force didn’t bomb it, so we’d have a nice
place to stay. I’m sure that’s true, by the way, and — because everything else was flat,
except this wonderful building — it became our headquarters. And so everybody that
worked in that headquarters, because we needed German — we couldn’t do
everything ourselves, we needed clerical staff, and so on. We, in our office, we had
no German clerks, because it was security. But everybody else did. And so our office
was — had the job of — of getting them the passes. Since I was the only person in the
office who spoke German, it’s — I was the contact guy. And they also — they send me
up to Bremerhaven for a couple weeks to — to handle the security office at the — at
the port up there. And I did that for, I would say until October, give or take. And
then, I had, at Ritchie, I had the — Ritchie was a weird place. When you finished
your course — I was in the 24" class, if that’s of any interest — that up to the 24"
class, when you graduated from Ritchie, you — they either prom — they promoted
you to corporal, sergeant, or second lieutenant. And they promoted me to nothing.
Starting with the 24" class, no more promotions. So, what they — they took some
people, and — who wanted to be officers, and they sent them — they send them to
Fort Benning, Georgia, on — to take the quick course, the 90 day wonder — I don’t
know if you ever heard that expression — the —

Interview with Ralph Hockley me
January 12, 2016
Q: I have something similar, but I don’t remember it — the — what it was called. It’s
something —
A: Yeah, 90 day wonder. They — they — they take these guys, they send them to Fort
Benning, make them infantry officers in 90 days, which usually it took six months,
or whatever. And so you could go from Ritchie to Benning to become a 90 day
wonder, and then come back as a second lieutenant, they had that, too. With the 24"
class, because of the — how far the war had progressed, they didn’t do that any more.
So I went in the war as a private. But then, once I was over there, they — they — well,
they promoted me to corporal, and I — I had also applied at Ritchie to join the
counter-intelligence corps, because that’s what I wanted. I wanted to catch Nazis.
That’s what they were doing. But they told me I was too young, so I didn’t get into
the CIC, you had to be older. But then, once I was in Bremen, and I applied again to
get into the counter-intelligence corps, and they accepted me. So, in the last six
months I was over there, I became a special agent of the counter-intelligence corps,
no insignia of rank, just two U.S.s, so that you could go to see some colonel, and
chew him about what somebody in his outfit was doing, and without him knowing
what your rank was, even though if you were 20 years old, they knew that you
weren’t a general. So, I sa —I—I did that. And it’s actually as a result of that, that I —
ultimately when I was in Syracuse University, I got a commission military
intelligence, because the gentleman that — before I left, when my time wa — came to

go home, I was interviewed by a colonel from intelligence headquarters in the
States, asked me if I wouldn’t stay as a warrant officer, or as an officer. And I said
no, I—I —I’d like to, but I— I —I want to go to college, I got to finish college, that’s
my first thing. But when I was at Syracuse in °48, I got a letter from the same
colonel, he didn’t know the c — the con — the connection, but he said, we’re
interested, if you would like to become a second lieutenant, military intelligence
reserve, and he gave me the conditions. And you had to have been a staff sergeant,
when I was a sergeant, which is one rank below the staff sergeant. So I wrote him
back and I say, well, colonel, I appreciate, but I’m only a sergeant, I’m not a staff
sergeant, so I don’t qualify. But, if you are interested in knowing whether you think
that I am qualified, if you’re the same Colonel Stevens that came to Bremen,
Germany and interviewed me in ’46, and asked me to accept a commission, then
you must know that I am qualified, otherwise you wouldn’t have interviewed me.
And he send me the same paper back, handwritten on there, I’m the same guy, you’ll
hear from me. And about three or four weeks later, I got a handwritten note from
him, and says, apply under army regulation so and so, so and so. I did, and within six
months I was a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve.

Q: Let’s go back still to Bremerhaven. Did you take part in any denazification
processes?
A: Oh yeah. It was lots of fun.
Q: Tell me, what was involved with that?
A: Well, they — they had — they had the allies put out a — an order at the end of the
war, they — they had — first of all, they had an automatic arrest category, that meant if
a German, a Nazi was more than something in the Nazi movement, it required that if
you found him, that you arrest him.
Q: Okay.
A: And — and then they had a category of the next ones down were — they couldn’t
get certain jobs. And then you do — there were the ones that you exonerated, and so
the CIC had the job of denazification. They had to — they got all the records of
people who applied for — for something, or that came across our — for one thing,
across our path, and they had to have them fill out the famous fragebogen, which
every German had to fill out, in which he said, you know, where he had been, when,
where he went to school, did he join the Nazi party, didn’t he join the Nazi party,
and etcetera.
Q: And did most of them ever, never join the Nazi party [indecipherable]

A: Well, most of them joined the Nazi party, but they were unimportant. They were
not functionaries, they were just members, because they had to maintain their job, or
something. There’s some truth to that.
Q: Okay.
A: A—a-—1if you wanted to be a teacher, probably, you had to be a member of the
party. Now, that da — didn’t mean how — how active you were or not, you just — it
was just a ticket that you had to punch. There are people who never did it, and
survived, but it just depended how much they — they trusted the system, or they
needed to eat. So they were not all — if they joined the Nazi party, they — we
determined they weren’t all bad people. We — we found all kinds of people, you
know, it — it — you never quite knew what was going to hit you next. There are two
things I might mention, wi — part of that period. I — they — my office was right next
to the jail there, we had a jail, American jail. And — which a friend of mine was the
commandant. And so I — I went to that jail all the time, to interrogate people. And
somebody brought to my attention that there was a guy — denunciation was the order
of the day. I devised my own questionnaire, and then I made people fill out that were
brought into my office. And I made them fill that out before I would talk to them.
And the first question was, what’s your name, date of birth, and profession. And who
— who do you want to talk to me about? And if the guy was a butcher, and he wanted

to talk to me about a butcher, I knew that he was trying to get the competition out of
the way.
Q: That’s — that’s very clever, you know, because didn’t — it’s an ugly thing —
A: Yeah.
Q: — denunciation. It —
A: Oh yeah, it — it was a big deal. Because people had nothing, so they — they used
denunciation in order to get themselves in a better position. So — but there was this
one guy, I found out — you know, I — I was given a tip, there was a guy who was
there, and he was — had the rank of so and so, which made him part of your
automatic arrest category. And so — but then — then I — yeah, so I — he had just been
released from our prison. So I figured out that they didn’t know who he was, so they
released him. So, I decided to arrest him. But being a nice guy, I decided that he’d
been in jail for, I don’t know how long, and he was spending the night with his
girlfriend, so I decided, well, let him have one night, and a — they had a curfew, from
si— 10 in the — 10 in the evening til six in the morning. So I— we didn’t do the
arresting ourselves, we charged the German police with that. So I gave orders to
have him arrested at 5:30. And — and they brought him to the prison, and then they
brought him over to my office. And in the meantime I found out — I didn’t find out at
first, but I found out that he had — we had had him, and we released him. And I say,

well, there’s something wrong here. So I— I said to myself, how do I address this?
We released him yesterday, and —
Q: We’re re-arresting him now.
A: — we’re re-arresting him. And so, when he came in my office, I mean, I never
forgot this, because up to this point, nobody had ever said to me that they had been a
Nazi of any consequence. And this guy, when he walked in, he sat down in my
office. The first question I ask him — don’t ask me why, I — you know, you do things
in life, you don’t know why you do them. You think you know why you do them. I
said to him, until when were you a Nazi? I did this because of the information I had
in front of me. And his answer was, oh, I’m still a Nazi. And I have to tell you, I
almost fell off my chair, because nobody had ever said they were a Nazi, you know’?
And so I said, oh, I said to myself, well that’s interesting, I gotta — this one I want to
hear. And he was there, I had him in there about two, three hours. I just wanted to — I
wanted to figure this out, what — what’s the deal? And he told me, you know, I can
spare you the details, but he told me that — that hit] — what Hitler wanted for
Germany was important because the Germans needed a leader, they needed a
fuehrer to lead them, etcetera, but he made mistakes, like he should never have
touched the Jews, and a few other things like that, and — but, in principle he still be-
believed in the philosophical principle of the fuehrer, the leader running the country,
the people don’t know, otherwise, what to do.

A: And so, I finally, you know, I remanded him to prison, because it said on paper
that I had to, but —
Q: Did you learn anything from him?
A: Oh yeah, I th — I learned a lot from him. That there’s one person in Germany that
was honest. There were others who were. And then, I mentioned before that the — the
thing, the other thing that I found fascinating is that we — we were involved in — you
know, there were all kinds of stories about there are still Nazis around, and we have
to watch them, you can’t — you know, if you drive down the street in a Jeep, they’re
liable to shoot at you, or kill you, or put up a wire. The — I don’t know whether you
even noticed, but the Jeeps all had a — a metal rod in the front of the — of the hood,
and if you were driving down the street, 1f somebody put a wire across the street, the
— this thing would cut the wire, so it wouldn’t kill you. Otherwise, because you
couldn’t put the roof down, the darn thing would decapitate you. And so they — they

never — never was worried about somebody doing anything nasty to me. They — they
— there — so there was the story that the Hitler youth — and this was, I think, inquiry,
investigation, that the Hitler youth still had a hard core of Hitler youth, who were
waiting for the moment to — and you talked about werewolves. Well, we — we got a
tip that there was a — in — in our area, there was a farmhouse which was headquarters
for these guys.
Q: So they — known that they were called the werewolves, or something?
A: Well, that’s what the legend called them.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: And [Il tell you a few words about that, in a — afterwards, we’ll — so we went out
there, and we — because the Germans kept such good records, you know, we went to
the — to this farmhouse to arrest some of these guys. Well, there was only one guy
there. And so we went through the farmhouse, but we found all the records of the
Hitler youth for the whole northern Germany, and we, of course, took them with us.
And we left the guy alone, we figured he — with the — we had gotten enough out of
this deal. And ba — the bottom line was, there was no resistance to speak of. These
were guys who were dreamers, and they had been set up, you know, before Hitler
collapsed, they say well, when — if we give up, we will fight to the end, you know,

very interesting today, because Secretary Rice — what’s her first name? Condoleezza
Rice made a famous speech, Iraq connection, that the — that the terrorists in Iraq
were just like the werewolves in Germany. And I had that thrown at me at a couple

command sergeant major just back from Iraq made this speech, and yes, there —
there are the — the — the — the terrorists in Iraq is like the werewolves in Germany,
and when it was over, I took him aside and said, look, Command Sergeant Major,
there were no werewolves in Germany. I can tell you, I was there, and I was
involved in this. And there was a co — marine colonel at a meeting in Houston, came
up with the werewolves, the — the guys in Iraq being like the werewolves, and I
said, it’s just — let me stand up here and tell you, it’s a damn lie. There were no

werewolves. There was one guy, who killed the mayor of Aachen, Germany, in —
before the war was over, and he was called a werewolf. And after that, there were no
werewolves. So it’s a — it’s a legend, that this existed. So, I’m still alive to tell that
the history is being misused.
Q: But a fascinating footnote, because it would be something that, you know, is a
logical question. The war is just lost, this had been such a powerful enemy, a

wouldn’t be out of the realms of, you know, possibility.

survival was the only thing that they had going for them. And the women were made

Q: You have — you know, you — I’m going to step aside a little bit here. I mean, you

came back. There are some, but very few, who came back to have such thorough
knowledge of the country in their postwar years. Yours starts now, right after World
War II, but then later goes on to have a — a career in — in intelligence with the
Americans, for several decades. What did — what did you learn in those decades? I
mean, there has to be a process, through which a — a human being goes, when they —
and — or they see someone they love, like their father, who suffered so much from
the hands of a system, that was adopted by a country. Was there a time in this
process where your feelings and your thoughts about Germany changed?

A: Well, my initial reaction — initial initial, in Bremen, was exemplified by the
following; I walked down the street in Bremen one day, and there was a man
beating his kid. And I was in American uniform. And I walked up to him and said,
stop it. We’re bringing democracy to you, in a democracy you don’t beat your kid on
the street. That was my immediate reaction. How do you get to the Germans? How
do you get them away from this business of — of punishment, of — of beating, of
harshness, and so on? So, all I could do at that moment was that. Gradually, the
young generation, you — you know, there — you had to wait for a while. Germany
was rebuilt amazingly fast, thanks to the Marshall Plan, and many other things. And
the Germans are, undoubtedly, very astute, and — what’s the word I’m trying to think
of — people. They — they work very hard, to this day. There are always exceptions,
but generally speaking. They’re well organized, they — they keep their nose to the
erindstone, and — and they were lucky with the initial governments they got, you —
you know, when you get a Konrad Adenauer, who was no pansy, who — who —
who ran Germany pretty harshly, but that built everything up, and then he was
followed by Erhard to fix the economy, and then of course, you had Willy Brandt,
who was a socialist, and brought a lot of social things to Germany. They — they had
some very good leaders. I can’t think of one chancellor of Germany that was really
bad. They had a couple of presidents, but presidents don’t matter. They’re — they
were figureheads, like the queen of England. It’s the chancellors who run the show.

So, gradually the young generations there, they went through all kinds of stuff. The
universities tended to be very liberal, to use a kind word. And so a lot of the students
got pretty left-wingish. But gradually, this stuff was drummed into them, what it is
like to be in democracy, and what — what happened is they — they — because there’s
been such a tremendous change in the way the world operates, that all they want —
the young people want to do is go — come to America, or France, or — you know,
they been — they were locked up in Germany, they couldn’t get out of Germany,
under Hitler. And so it — suddenly, there was some freedom of travel, and they saw
that there were other societies, that weren’t as bad as they were made out to be. And
the people went to Brittany on vacation, instead of staying in Germany, saw that it
was nice in Brittany, or wherever they went. Half of Germany’s been to — to the
Canary Islands, and to Spain, because — because they love the sun, primarily, but
that’s another — another world down there. So they — they — they passed a
constitution, which is very democracy oriented, and they have a Supreme Court that
is enforcing it. And it’s not always to our liking, but it doesn’t have to be. I —I
always try to take people for who — the individual qualities, and what they were like,
and their — I said, I met a lot of nice people. There are a lot of nice people in
Germany. There are certain things that — at — at my farewell party, by the German —

they are protecting the young people from the old people, and they — they — they — as

where — you know.
Q: Yeah. Could it — hang on a second. Now, how — I want to turn the question
around a little bit. Have you met other German Jews who left Germany, and never
went back, because they wouldn’t go back. It’s a choice. And, have you shared with
them what you think, or what you learned when you were there in the post-war
years? Or, let me put it this way, what would you tell such people, about the
Germany you came to know?
A: Well, one of the things I came ta — would tell them is that, of course, my situation
was different, because — because I was there as a United States government
representative. I did not live in Germany as an American living in Germany, I lived
in Germany as a government representative of the United States. And so, all of my
relations were based on that. If a policeman would stop me on the street, there’s

nothing he could do to me, because I had a semi-diplomatic passport. They have a
status between the private passport, and the diplomatic passport, and it’s — it’s called
a official passport? Do you remember what it’s called? Official passport. And I had
one of those. And you know, therefore I never f— I was never dependent on the
German economy. I used it, but I was never dependent on it.
Q: There’s a difference there.
A: We got — we — we went to PX, the commissary, to go shopping. That didn’t mean
we couldn’t go to German stores, and we did. But I was never — I was never in the
position that a person would have been who was not with the government, who was
a German Jew, and went back a-as a private person, and reintegrated in a German
system. I was not dependent on the German health system, the German anything. So,
you know, to answer you — the first part of your question, I know a lot of people who
never went back. I also know some people who went back and liked it, but they were
there only as visitors, and some people who said they wouldn’t — [phone ringing]

the last few months. Her name is Ruth Hockley. Ruth Hockley was married to my

person that I’ve ever known, who spent the entire war in ger — in Berlin, and
survived. And she’s been interviewed by the — her son told me that she’s been

because there are very few people who survived. Her mother’s name was

never went back. I mean, having spent the entire war in Berlin, that was enough for

very wide perspective. So —
A: I went — I went occasionally — I went occasionally to a German synagogue.
Q: Did you become religious at any time?
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: My son Clifford was Bar Mitzvah in Bonn. We first went — we were from
Alameda cal — from Alameda county, from Oakland, California, and we went to
Oakland and say, can we arrange for him to be Bar Mitzvah? And my wife was
reasonably religious. Not overly religious, but ch — and they gave her such a hard
time — oh, you have to do this, you have to do that, and you know, I finally said,
yeah, I guess you guys don’t want us in Oakland, California. They couldn’t be
bothered, in the synagogue where she and I got married. And so I said well, we’ll do
it in Bonn, it'll be a great favor to them. Because there’s hardly anybody in
Germany who is Bar Mitzvah any more. As a matter of fact, in the year that he was
Bar Mitzvah, there were only two; him, and the son of the Israeli ambassador, and
that was it. And so it was a big deal. And this lady was there. We were neighbors, we

A: — all of Germany, and was, for a long time, only West Germany. They’ve made
a tremendous effort to — to — generally speaking, to atone, if you wish, for what they
did to millions of people. Jews, but not only Jews.
Q: Yeah.
A: A lot of others. And there are really not enough people left. You’re going through
this cycle right now where Mrs. Merkel is letting in a million refugees, which my
analysis would tell me that it’s a mistake. But she — she — it 1s bigger than what she
predicted. She did it in the spirit of — of making up for Germany’s name in the past.
Of course, she was born in East Germany, and she didn’t come to Germany until
after the wall came down, and it became one Germany. She’s probably very good at
her job, but in this case, I would, as a former intelligence official, I would say that
taking in a million Muslims, or foreigners — doesn’t have to be Muslims — at one
time, is something which a democracy can’t handle. It’s just sheer numbers. You
have to be able — you — if you charge your — your security officials,
counterintelligence officials, with keeping the country safe, you can’t expect them to
handle a hundred thousand people at once. You know, it’s just — it’s an
overwhelming task. If you do it slowly, that’s a different thing. And so, I think that —
and this could co-cost her — her — her — her chancellorship, cause she’s running
again. But there’s enough people in Germany who feel that — who feel endangered.
Because when that many people come in, you don’t know who they are. And — and

know, they’re — they’re not — they’re trying to be nice people.
Q: Yeah.
A: They’re trying to be humane, and — but, you know, you — you can — when you
think about the Nazi period, you’ve got to come to the conclusion that it’s very hard
to visualize that that many people participated in so many nasty things, period. That

concentration camp guards. There are doctors who participated in medical
experiments, which were deadly to people.
Q: Yes.
A: Just to test them. Who — who — where do the — these people come from? Is it
possible — this is always the question, is it possible in the United States? And you
know, I used to say it wasn’t, but there are — there are bad people, whatever that
means, people who have no conscience, in every country. I used to say that it used to
be that 10 percent are far right, 10 percent are far left, and the other 80 percent try to
get along. I hope the figures never get any higher than that. I am not sure of that.

— in the 1970s, they had an organization known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang. You
probably remember them, you were there. The Baader-Meinhof Gang was very
dangerous, and when people talk about terrorists in the Middle East, for example, I
always — my answer always is, look, Germany is a very well organized country,
from the point of view of police, and security services. My guess is — I didn’t count
them individually, but my guess is, because I was involved in it, that there were
about 30 members in the Baader-Meinhof Gang. They were absolute nuts. You — I
read their manifesto, I didn’t understand a word of it. I mean, they were so way out,
you know, it didn’t make any sense. They killed people. They killed bankers, they
tried to kill the commander of the American forces in Europe with a mortar shell,
when he went to work in the morning. They, for the sake of — were they Nihilists? I
don’t know. They were — they were crackpots. But it took the German intelligence
services approximately 10 years to catch — catch them one by one. Ten years for 30
guys. If you assume that in the Middle East, you have one-tenth of one percent of
bad guys — Iraq was 27 million, that’s 27,000. You’ll never find them all 27,000,
especially when they’re [indecipherable] somewhere out there teaching young kids

A: — to do the same. So anyway, that’s from an analysis of the world as it is. The
Germans got them, but it took them a long time. One by one.
Q: Mr. Hockley, thank you.
A: You’re welcome.
Q: Thank you very, very much.
A: [hope I haven’t worn you out.
Q: No, not at all, it’s been fascinating. It’s been a wonderful day, and absolutely
fascinating.

Interview with Ralph Hockley
January 12, 2016
A: Carrollton.
Q: Carrollton, Texas. We are — this is January 12", 2016, continuing his oral
history, this is the donation of materials to the museum’s archives. Before we get to
the actual donation materials, I did want to ask Mr. Hockley to talk a little bit about
this photograph. This is a — a printout of a blown-up photograph. There’s actually a
third photograph that goes here, and I didn’t have that. But I wanted to give him the
opportunity to talk about anybody in the photograph, this is from the Quaker staff in
France, in 1940, correct? I just wanted to give him the chance to talk about people.
All the names are identified in his book, so we don’t have to identify everyone, but
there are a couple of people that I know that you had mentioned to me, in passing,
and I wanted to make sure that were — were recorded. First off, this 1s you, correct?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you remember when this photograph was taken?
A: Well, it had to have been taken at the turn — at the turn of 1940 to ’41.
Q: Okay.
A: Give or take a month. December, January, something like that.
Q: Okay. And this is in the Quaker offices?
A: In the Quaker office in Marseilles, France.
Q: In Marseilles, France.
A: 29 Boulevard d’Atheénes.

A: Yes.
Q: This — this is a very —
A: It was a big room.
Q: — big room, okay. Now, was this a m — central meeting that everybody came in?
Cause I think there are some people who didn’t work in the Marseilles offices.
A: I think what it was, is that this James Vale(ph), and Mr. Evans, I believe —
Q: Okay.
A: — were visiting from the United States, and they brought everybody together to
meet with them, conference with them, etcetera.
Q: Okay.
A: That’s got to be close to what happened.
Q: That would — that would make sense.
A: Otherwise there was no reason for everybody being there.
Q: Mm-hm, okay. Now, just a couple people, just to — to highlight specifically.
Howard Kirschner.
A: Yes.
Q: Is behind you in the middle.
A: Yep.
Q: So he was —

A: And his wife —
Q: And his wife, Gertrude.
A: —1n front of him.
Q: Yeah. And then, you talked about him a bit during the — the oral history, so we
don’t give them the history. Was there anything else that you wanted to — to mention
about him, and his work? Your impressions of him?
A: He was a very serious person. He didn’t smile too often. That’s what I mean by
serious.
Q: Okay.
A: He was a man on a mission. He was afraid of nobody. He went to see Marshal
Pétain several times, to plead for the children of — under his tutelage, 1f you wish.
He didn’t take no for an answer, he was not afraid of authority. He was an American,
he was a wealthy American, and — though he lived very Spartan life. To s —
underline that, he never drank coffee, he didn’t drink tea, he didn’t drink anything
like Coke. My mother occasionally would come in in the afternoon and — and make
hot water for him, with sugar. He would have, in the afternoon, a cup or two of hot
wat — hot water with sugar, and he would have a piece of toast with it, that my
mother prepared for him. And he got to be 98, I think, and for years I didn’t drink
any coffee, because if Howard Kirschner got to be 98 by that kind of a diet — they
did not eat rich food, of any kind, he and his wife. He was a — as I said, the best way

to say it is, he was a man with a mission, and he had he had a large staff all over
Europe. He had to keep track of many operations, and from what I could see as a
kid, he did it with great flair and ability, and — and dedication, would be the word. I
saw him a number of times, years later, when he was not — I — I believe he may have
had a falling out with the Quakers.
Q: Okay.
A: On -— on authority, or something. Whether this had anything to do with it, I don’t
know, but he — when I saw him in later years, he was a — working for religious,
philosophical organizations, and — but he was always doing good things for other
people.
Q: Was there anyone else in particular that you wanted to —
A: Well, the — the —
Q: — highlight? Again, I’m missing the last — the s — the side where Burns Chalmers
on that I’m — I’m actually missing from the photograph.
A: Yeah.
Q: But it is in the book.
A: This was Mr. Weems(ph), this was Josiah Mar-Marvel(ph). They — they all had
special missions, some of which I didn’t know what they were. I was very friendly
with Mr. Marvel(ph), as a matter of fact, I even corresponded with him, after I was

A: Okay.
Q: You mentioned earlier there was somebody who functioned as like a bodyguard?
A: Yeah, well, he was — that’s my perception.
Q: Yeah.
A: This guy, Alberto. Alberto — who, I know his name. It may be in the book. Is it
on the back? You might — if you turn around — Carrion, c-a- double r — i-o-n. He —

would drive us around. And in this picture here — in this picture, which 1s in the
book, this is him. And so I went out with Mrs. Loissen(ph), to deliver food to the
sisters, and you can tell I wasn’t over-nourished. He was always there, always
keeping an eye that I was okay.
Q: Okay.
A: That was not a function of his, that was his personal — personal mission.
Q: How often did you travel to — for distributions like that?
A: Not very often.
Q: Okay.
A: You know what it had to do with? This was Mrs. Loisson(ph). The reason I’m
there, is for k — because I spoke French.
Q: Ah, okay.
A: And the sisters — the sisters only spoke French, so —
Q: Okay.
A: — so when somebody got in that situation, they say oh, we’ll take Rudy —
Rudee(ph) along, he can interpret. So, he did.
Q: Yeah, some of these I have not seen. I don’t think the AFSE even has that

and he is the one that I worked with very much, you know, send me to the consulate
and talked to the — who arranged with the consul that my family would get out of
France. So —
Q: He’s the one who lived with —
A: With — with Bingham.
Q: Bingham, oh yeah, Hiram Bingham, yeah. Do you remember David
Blickenstaff?
A: Yes.
Q: At all?
A: Yes.
Q: What do you remember? Blickenstaff had worked with Kirschner in Spain, and
then —
A: Oh, blicken — he was — that he was a very nice guy. He was a very friendly guy,
and always was interested in me and my welfare, and whatever, and they kept me

Quakers didn’t pay me, but they had food that they gave out. And every once in a
while they — they would give me a piece of Swiss cheese about this big, to take
home, or a big container of honey. Stuff that had some good, strong nutrients in
them, and — which was worth a — more than anything you could buy in the store,
which didn’t have in the first place, but Blickenstaff was nice. These la — I knew
them all, but I — this is Miss Leaven(ph). She was a very effective lady. This is Mrs.
Burnell(ph). She is the wife of — of him. And this guy’s name is Benjamin. I think
he was the financial guy. I think he was Jewish, as a matter of fact.
Q: I know they had people from across Europe, an-and Ireland, and Norway, and
like you said, many Americans [indecipherable] for them.
A: I mean, they — they — they did stuff. Everything they did was legal, but they
obviously, some of them — and you never knew who, but some of them, in order to
do what they had to do, they had to make side agreements with — just like — like
Varian Fry. You know, he — he’d go down and negotiate a deal with the guy who
owned the boat, in order to get somebody from point A to point B, you had to take
certain steps — and I’m sure there were a few people in there that the word legal was
— I mean, what did it mean in occupied France, or in — in Vichy, France, if you had
to reach a certain goal, you had to do what it took to get to the goal, which didn’t
make it not illegal, but on a margin, you know. It’s like Hiram Bingham meeting

with Varian Fry in the mountains, to discuss how to get Feuchtwanger, or — or
Chagall or somebody out of — out of France, you know, that was these side deals.
Q: Did you have the impression — and again, I — we want to get to the main part of
this as the donation, but did you have the impression that when you — the access that
you were given to the consulate, to the — to the office, where — the visa office, was
that because of the Quakers’ name —
A: Yes.
Q: — or was it — do you — do you get the feeling that somebody, like Varian Fry’s
group could have shown up and had the same kind of access, or the Mennonites, or
the Unitarians?
A: Well, I don’t know whether Varian Fry — I suspect — well, I don’t know. But
Varian Fry was so close with — with Hiram Bingham, that he didn’t have to go
there, because Hiram Bingham could have gotten him anything he wanted.
Q: Okay.
A: In my case, it was — it was kind of an administrative thing, that it was too time
consuming for somebody like — like Chalmers to do, and I was there — 1t was — he
was more — it was kind of a clerical thing, you know, except there was a very high
level clerical thing, you know, it was — cause it was confidential. But you’ve seen
my — the letter that I su-suspect introduced me to the consulate?
Q: Well, I saw — do you — do you have it?

Hockenheimers, which goes to the Suss(ph) family, my grandmother.
Q: Okay.
A: And — and I — there’s still pieces missing on that, but I'll try to get them. And my
grandfather, and then it goes up all the way to 1775, or ’80, or something. Then you
have my wife, whose name was — maiden name was Frankel.
Q: And then, f-r-a-n-k-e-l, correct?
A: Well —
Q: I know that some generations —
A: It’s got an umlaut —
Q: Okay.
A: It started with an umlaut, then in the States, because umlauts don’t exist, they
made it Frankel. In German, it could have two dots on the a, or an ae. All of it
would be accurate. The — and her mother’s maiden name was Broch(ph). Her father

initially. She was born in Hamburg, he was born in Drohobych, which is — could be
in any country you want it to be.
Q: Yeah, I get it.
A: So we —I—I have a lot of information in the Frankel department. I have less

Same thing. And then, on my mother’s side of the family, I have the family tree of
the Lowenthals(ph).
Q: Okay.
A: And the thing that is very dangerous there, I think I told you, is that she was
married to a Lowenthal(ph), and her bir — maiden name was a Lowenthal(ph), so
you have to really be careful you don’t get the two mixed up. I have the last
postcards we’ll get to — Pll show them to you.

quite put my finger on, as to whether he — because of this weird thing about a
Lowenthal(ph) being married to a Lowenthal(ph), I — I’m not quite sure whether

Six or seven pages about — about Edward Lowenthal(ph), which still doesn’t

A: Yeah, the wives, they didn’t invite wives, but they had to invite mine, because I
came from Germany.
Q: Okay.
A: For this luncheon, so they couldn’t tell her to go to — get lost. So I ask a question,
is why — why aren’t the wives included? Say well, some of them, the men became
famous and prosperous and others didn’t. And so, they would have to wear clothes
that the ones couldn’t afford the clothes that the wives who had the money could, so
they didn’t invite the wives, so there would be no jealousy. But this was my wife and
— and this is the owner of the restaurant. That was in ’79. If you’re interested, [Il
have to write something on there. I can probably send that to you separately.
Q: You can send it separately, we are recording it, so we have —

And he enlisted the French Foreign Legion, went to Africa. He tried to talk my dad

worth — I’m not a hundred percent sure, but I’m almost, that the purpose of this birth
— it’s not a certificate, it’s a urkunde, it’s a document, was to indicate — you know,
the Germans, the Nazis, changed people’s names. This says her name — no, that’s the
mother. Where 1s it?
Q: It — probably behind, it specifies that it’s Sarah or Israel.
A: Yes.
Q: Yeah.

preparation of applying for a visa, cause you had to go back and get all of your

A: Well, my father had a cousin by the name of Albert Suss(ph), and he lived in
southern France, and when I was stationed in Berlin and Frankfurt, we went to —
when we went — we went to the French Riviera a lot, so I always went to see him.

Something like that. I figured out five times, I forget it five times. But I’m trying to

Polish, at that particular time.
Q: Well, I have — one of my colleagues is fluent in Polish, and has done a
tremendous amount of research into family history with — in — in Poland, so he may

was left in Berlin, and the parents went to see the dying son.

A2: She came with her aunt.
Q: To Lisbon’?

vaccination.
