>> Bill Benson: Good morning and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum. My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program "First
Person." Thank you for joining us. We began our 17th year of the "First Person" program
just yesterday. Our "First Person" today is Mr. Manny Mandel, whom we shall meet
shortly.

This 2016 season of "First Person" is made possible by the generosity of the
Louis Franklin Smith Foundation with additional funding from the Arlene and Daniel Fisher
Foundation and the Helena Rubinstein Foundation. We are grateful for their sponsorship.

"First Person" is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust
who share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each
of our "First Person" guests serve as volunteers here at this museum. Our program will
continue twice weekly through mid August.

The museum's website at www.ushmm.org provides information about each of
Our upcoming "First Person" guests. Anyone interested in staying in touch with the
museum and its programs can complete the Stay Connected card that's in your program
or speak with a museum representative at the end of the program. In doing so, you will
receive an electronic copy of Manny Mandel's biography so you can remember and share
his testimony after you leave here today.

Manny will share with us his "First Person" account of his experience during the
Holocaust and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If time allows at the end of the
program, we'll have an opportunity for you to ask Manny some questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are
about to hear from Manny is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared
a brief slide presentation to help with his introduction.

Manny Mandel was born to a religious Jewish family on May 8th, 1936 in Riga,
Latvia. Manny was just 3 when World War II started in 1939. Although he was born in
Riga, Latvia, Manny's family were Hungarian Jews. They had moved briefly to Latvia

because of his father's work. Here we see a portrait of Manny's parents, Yehuda and Ella
Mandel holding their infant son Manny.

Shortly after Manny's birth his father accept add post as a chief cantor in
Budapest and the family returned to hungry where they lived in 1933. Hungary is
highlighted on this map and Budapest is highlighted in yellow. Manny father was based it
at the renowned Rombach Synagogue. In this picture we see Manny and his father on a
street in Budapest. The Hungarian government passed anti-Jewish laws beginning in
1938. In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis Alliance and in 1941 Hungarian troops joined in
the invasion of the Soviet Union. The war, an increasing restrictions, made for lives in
Jews in Hungary increasingly difficult. The photo on the left shows Manny outside his
apartment on his first day of school in 1942 in Budapest. On the right, we see a
contemporary photo of Manny standing outside the same apartment.

German forces occupied Hungary in March, 1944. Manny and his mother Ella
were fortunate to be included in a program in which Jews would be transported to
Palestine in exchange for trucks. Within months, they were transported by the Nazis to
the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near Hannover, Germany in preparation for the
event actual departure from Europe. This is a historical photo of Bergen-Belsen.

Negotiations for their transport to Palestine broke down and in December 1944,
about six months before the end of the war, Manny and his mother were released from the
Bergen-Belsen camp and transported to safety in neutral Switzerland. There they stayed
at the Heiden Children's Home pictured here where Ella worked as a teacher. Manny is
lying down in the front on your left and his mother Ella is standing in the back in the
middle.

After the war, Manny and his mother reunited with his father in Israel. They
subsequently immigrated to the United States and lived in Philadelphia. Manny is a
graduate of Temple University and did his graduate work at the University of
Pennsylvania. He is a clinical social worker. He met his future wife Adrienne in
Philadelphia and they were married in 1958. They have been married 58 years.

After working for the B'nai B'rith Youth Organization in Cleveland and in
Michigan, Manny and Adrienne moved to Washington, D.C. where Manny became the
national program director for B'nai B'rith Youth Organization. He would later go to work for
the Peace Corps before beginning his own psychotherapy practice in 1980. Manny retired
from his practice in 2014. Adrienne's many accomplishments include having served in the
Maryland Legislature as an elected member of the House of Delegates. She is the
immediate past-president of the Washington suburban san a tear commission, the nation's
eighth largest water and wastewater utility. Adrienne retired from the water authority just
in 2014.

| might also mention Adrienne for many years on the board of directors for the
center of global aiming at Catholic University of America. Manny and Adrienne live in
Silver Spring, Maryland. They have two children and three grandchildren. Their daughter
Lisa 26-year-old son Zachary graduated from the University of Maryland and their
24-year-old daughter Gabrielle graduated from the University of Michigan and is now a
graduate student at John Jay University in New York. Manny and Adrienne's son David
has a 19-year-old daughter Alexandra who has been at the summer Bolshoi Ballet
Program in Julliard in New York. She graduated from high school in 2015 and attends

George Washington University. I'm pleased to say Adrienne, their son and daughter and
nephew are all in the front row and joined by their family friends Christine Bishop from
Chicago and Tom McIntyre.
Manny speaks about his Holocaust experience in schools and synagogues. He
volunteered at the museum, leading museum tours for school and law enforcement
groups. Manny celebrates his 80th birthday on May 8th. He may say the significance
about that date a little bit later. With that, | would like to join you in welcoming our "First
Person" Mr. Manny Mandel.

(applause)
>> Bill Benson: Manny, thanks so much -- thanks so much for joining us and for being
willing to be our "First Person" today. | know you have got a busy week. You're speaking
again here at the museum tomorrow, | understand. You have so much to share with us
and a limited time, so we'll get right to it.

You were born in Riga, Latvia, as | mentioned earlier, in 1936 but your family
stayed there and certainly yours was a short one before you moved to Budapest. War
began in Europe when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 when you were just
3 years old.

Let's start first with you telling us a little bit about your family, your parents, and
your life before the war, before the Holocaust began.
>> Manny Mandel: You need to know that there is something unique about Hungary, not
us, but Hungary and the Nazi government. You need to know if you don't know that only
two countries in Europe, basically, were in a different situation than all the others.
Specifically Hungary was an Ally was Germany. As a consequence, the Jewish
community of Hungary had a different experience than the Jewish community of Poland, a
very significant difference in that we did not have any occupation by Germans. The
Germans don't arrive in Hungary, in presence, in person, until 1944. And you know how
late in the war that is because the war ends in 1945.

So for the first years of the war, from 1938, '39 through the early '40s, our
difficulties come not so much from the Nazis but from the war itself. Bombings every time.
Other kinds of things. And certain restrictions that the government, in fact, was able to
manipulate. We were under the rule of the Hungarian Nazi Party but that's different than
being under the rule of the German Nazi party. So our experience is war related more so
than Holocaust related.
>> Bill Benson: But in that short period beginning in March 1944, it was an extraordinarily
horrific time. And we'll turn to that.

So your family life and your family before the war, you told me a significant story
that your mother shared with you along the lines of someone saying one day, well, today
you now speak Yugoslavian. What was significant about that?
>> Manny Mandel: That's before my time. That's really after the First World War. After
the First World War, Hungary is truncated and some of it becomes Yugoslavia, some of it
becomes Czechoslovakia. My mother was raised in the Hungarian part. She was a
school kid, maybe 10 years old or third grade. And that's when the war ended, First World
War, 1919 or so. And one day the teacher comes in and says, when you come back to
school next Monday, we're going to switch language. We have been teaching you in
Hungarian to Serbo-Croatian. It has as much in common as the moon and earth. But

they were bilingual. There was no problem in that situation. But Yugoslavia was created
so let's use the Yugoslav language which was Serbo-Croatian. My mother's family,
brothers and sisters and parents, maintained Hungarian in the home. But in school, it
was, in fact, in Serbo-Croatian which | don't speak. | probably know six words. At one
time | may have known 20.
>> Bill Benson: Manny, your father was an important cantor in Budapest. Tell us how he
got to that position.
>> Manny Mandel: My father -- well, the shorter version is the fact that my father at some
point after serving in the Czech Army, he was drafted because this is not Czechoslovakia.
He was able to get to Vienna. My father was able to get in a cantor school which was
world renowned at the time in Vienna. When he graduated from that school, he wanted to
have a job in Hungary with his hopes being a cantor in Budapest. For those of you who
don't know, the cantor in the Jewish community is one who leads the services and there's
lots of music involves and choirs involved and so forth.

My father wanted to, in fact, be in Budapest which is to him the New York
Yankees of The Metropolitan opera of the cantores. He was unable to get working papers
in Budapest because he had been a Czech citizen having served in the Czech Army. Not
by his own choice.

So he looked around Europe and he was able to find a very interesting and very
important position in Riga. We have no Latvian connection or family. We know nobody in
Latvia. At least | didn't. And they were then ready to come back to Budapest because he
did get an appointment in Budapest in 1936. They waited for me to arrive. As soon as |
arrived, within weeks, we moved to Budapest. | can tell you that my father -- some years
ago when my father was still alive, my wife and | went to Riga for a weekend visit to see it.
It's a nice place. My father said to me, look up "post iela sesi." That's Post Street 6. That
was their address. That was the only Latvian he knew. We visited the building, and it was
and enjoyable weekend.
>> Bill Benson: His father in his journey to coming the cantor in Budapest, there were
some important decision points that he had earlier in his life. One of them was when he
was in the Army, the Army wanted him to sing for them.
>> Manny Mandel: One of my favorite kind of warm, kind of fuzzy stories, my father
drafted into the Czech Army. Now, the Czech Army, as many Armies, don't have various
musical kind of things. It was some kind of anniversary of the Czech something. So they
put on an opera. For those of you know anything about the Bohemian composer, Bedrich
Smetana, he wrote the opera called Prodana Nevesta, The Bartered Bride. They wanted
my father to sing the lead. My father could not read music. He had never seen an opera.
He was able to be coached like a trained ape of sorts, and he did reasonably well.

Based on that experience, the commanding musician of the whatever suggested
that they have a deal for him. The deal is, after his Army service, which they will cut a little
short if he is acceptable and if it's acceptable to him to send him to Prague to a
conservatory to study music and to study voice to become an opera singer. My father
didn't Know what to do.

He couldn't approach his father with this kind of a question. He was reluctant.
So he called on his uncle, my grandmother's brother who was a lawyer. And he called the
uncle who was kind of the conciliatory of the family to talk to his father. And the

https://collections.ushmm.org

)
uncle -- my great uncle goes to talk to his brother-in-law and they had a conversation.
And comes back to my father and says, this is what your father said. You have to
understand where they're living and what the background is, very religious family. | never
knew my grandfather. He died years before | was born of smoking.

But in any case, he says, | have seven children. If my son Yehuda goes to sing
in the opera and violates the Sabbath and things of that nature, | will have six children.
Thus ended my father's opera career.

And the other -- those of you that know opera, he would have been a perfectly
good tenor.
>> Bill Benson: One of the other decision points, as | recall, Manny, is that he had
opportunities to be a cantor elsewhere including, | think, London, other places than
Hungary. Did he ever later express in light of what happened to the family, did he ever
express regret about not having taken one of those positions?
>> Manny Mandel: Yes and no. He did not express any kind of resentment upon not
taking a position because his goal in life was to be in Budapest. And the other side of the
coin is he said, had | taken the position in London, we would have escaped the Holocaust.
Interesting where he was, in those days people went on various kinds of -- what they call
probers. They were auditions. One was in the duke's place synagogue in London which
was bombed during the war. If he would have taken that, perhaps other members of the
family, would have been avoided during the Holocaust.
>> Bill Benson: As you said to us earlier the full force of the Holocaust and war did not hit
your community in Hungary until the spring of 1944, there were still many difficulties for
you once the war was underway in Europe, beginning in fall 1939. Tell us about the
circumstances of your family and what you may recall yourself being as young as you
were from those first few years of the war, before it really came to Hungary.
>> Manny Mandel: Because | was as young as | was and because of the circumstances in
which we lived, | described the fact that | lived very much in a bubble. | was well-protected
from much of this. | Knew about many things. | recall them. | can describe them. | did
not get the impact of the effect that | would have, had | been five or eight years older. If |
had been five or eight years older, chances are | wouldn't be.

But | was very well-protected but | saw things. | was very surprised and kind of
upset in a way that when we saw the Hungarian soldiers on the street and knew they were
Allies with the Germans my parents were upset with that. | could understand that. |
understand this is a 5 and 6-year-old talking. | don't know why you root for a hometown. |
don't know if you folks are from Washington. But the football team from your home
community is the one you root for. In Washington we don't root for Dallas. We root for
Washington.

(laughter).

| didn't understand why my parents were rooting not for the local team but for the
Allies. That's difficult for a kid to understand after knowing local heros.

Other things began to happen. The Hungarian Numerus Clausus which were
the restricted laws were passed in the '20s, not the ‘30s. You may know that the ‘30s the
German Nuremberg laws came out. But Hungarian laws were passed in the '20s after
First World War but not really enforced until much later, maybe 10, 12 years later in the
late '30s.

SO aS a consequence of that, from 1940 or so, my father was conscripted into
the labor battalions. Hungarian men were drafted into the Army and fought in Russia.
Hungarian Jews were not drafted into the Army but into labor battalions to backfill those
positions that Hungarian men had, which had to do with some farming and some mining
and railroad repair and road repair. And my father was perhaps like a traveling salesman.
After a while it was normal for him not to be home.

But from '42 to '44, | saw him infrequently. | did see him but infrequently. We
would get a call or a visit or a letter that said on Tuesday at 3:00, he will be at such and
such a railroad station to be gone for a day, a week, or an indeterminant period of time.
He would be out for a week, home for a week, out for a day. Always in Hungary. It's not
really that big. Anywhere a couple of hours by train. So | had very limited contact with
him at that time.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us what the Arrow Cross was.
>> Manny Mandel: The Arrow Cross is the symbol, crossed arrows, is a symbol as
opposed to the swastika, is the symbol of the Hungarian political party. In Germane it was
a political party that had heavy impact on the Army and the government. In Hungary, it
wasn't such an Army. It had less impact. It was a ruling philosophy of an anti-Semitic
nature.
>> Bill Benson: And the anti-Semitism began to increase and more and more restrictions
were imposed on Jews, what were some of the restrictions you recall?
>> Manny Mandel: The restrictions on a kid were very limited. Let me say it in two parts.
Part one would be the air raid that happened once, twice, three times a night, were a
major impact. Even | could understand the next morning when | go to school, the building
next door to me may be gone. There was significant damage in Budapest. It was bombed
early by the Russians and later by the Allies coming from two directions.

But most of the other things did not have impact on me specifically, for example,
the restrictions in jobs, restrictions in some travel, restrictions in which you could and
couldn't shop, but | didn't do the shopping so | would not have been bothered by that in
any direct sense.
>> Bill Benson: You told me, | thought, a very poignant story in that as a kid, like any kid,
you wanted a bicycle but your father wouldn't let you have one.
>> Manny Mandel: Well, | had a trike, like an overgrown tricycle. My father said there
were two reasons he blocked the possibility. One | will handle, one | will not. What | can
handle is what | said, | lived in an apartment building on the fifth floor which was 50 years
old. It had an elevator which was also 50 years old. And on many occasions, that
elevator had parts that would break down and the parts that were to replace them were
manufactured in factories that would do ammunition and guns and stuff. And elevator
parts for my building were kind of low on the priority list. So it was out of service perhaps
as much as it was in service.

When we had to go to air raid shelters every night, five stories down, five stories
up. | could not carry a bike five stories down because in Europe you ride in the park, not
in the backyard which you don't have. He was a strong gentleman in his 30s so he would
truck the bike down and back up.

But there was a second problem. All of us, one of the restrictions was we wore
a Yellow Star to be identified. | thought the star was a major mark of heroism because

https://collections.ushmm.org

if
after all, | was 6 years old or 7 and | wore a star just like the adults did. | then discovered
that it was true this bicycle experience | began to discover that this was not so much a
mark of heroism but a target that could be attacked in some way.

My father said to me, if we go to the park and you ride the bike with the Yellow
Star and you are out of my sight, someone might have the notion -- because it happened
in other place -- to whack you on the head. Not to steal the bike, they don't want the bike,
just because you are a target and it's open season on these kinds of things. And for that
reason, you don't have a bike. | was very upset by that.

But you have to understand that this heroism notion of the Yellow Star to identify
me as a Jew was not a mark of heroism but a mark of targeting for possible mayhem.
That was a particular experience that began me to teach what was going on. | can add
when we came to this country in 1949, | was 13 years old. And one of the very first things
my parents did when | came home from school one day, they said we are going to the
department store, something we don't have anymore. What are we going to buy? A
bicycle. So | had -- and | treasured that bicycle. | think it lived with my in my bedroom, |
polished it four times a year. It was a Schwinn for those of you old enough to remember
Schwinn bicycles.
>> Bill Benson: Do you remember going to school? What was school like?
>> Manny Mandel: | went to a parochial school, a Jewish day school which happened to
be three or four blocks from my house.

My apartment was on the corner of two streets, this one and this one. And my
parent's bedroom was on the corner. From the bedroom, you could see the school.
Maybe four blocks away, three blocks away. Yet, I'm told on many occasions, perhaps
every day, somebody would follow me to school because that Yellow Star in first grade
was an absolute invitation to be whacked on the head. Again, they are not going to rob
me of my money or my wallet or my driver's license. But they were going to whack me on
the head because it was open season on that kind of mayhem. And it did happen, not to
me but it did happen.
>> Bill Benson: In December 1941, your family had a truly horrifying experience while you
were visiting your aunt in another city. Tell us about that.
>> Manny Mandel: That was my very first experience beginning to understand particularly
in recollection what this was all about. I'm 5 1/2 years old in the winter of '41. As | said to
you, my mother grew up in northern Yugoslavia which was southern Hungary. And my
grandparents and aunts lived there. My mother had two sisters and three brothers but
they were no longer living there.

In any case, we go down to a city called Novi Sad, in those days many cities had
multiple names because it depends on which country they belonged in in a certain time.
Novi Sad is a Serbian name.

We go there by train. It's about 3, 3 1/2 hours south of Budapest by train. We
stay at my aunt's house. My mother's younger sister. It's very nice. | don't remember
exactly what we did. But! do recall that my aunt's husband had a cook factory. | was
taken to the factory to be given a tour. | was interested to see what kind of products they
make out of cork. I'm not sure it's significant. My uncle died and the factory went.

One morning, perhaps three days after we were there, somebody comes up the
stairs and says there's something going on in the street. Policeman come up and say

knock, knock, ladies and gentlemen, you need to dress warmly because you have to be
outside. We have to do acensus. Now, it's winter. It's not bitter but it's winter and it's
cold. The Germans or the Hungarians, but the ruling government, was going to count
Jews every 20 minutes, | think. Now a census in this country they did every ten years.
There they did with great frequency, on the assumption, perhaps a correct one, if you
count people and know where they are, you can control their movement and what they do
and where they are.

SO we were to come outside, my mother, my father, my aunt and we were on
the street on the sidewalk. We were told to turn left and start walk can in that direction.
We had no idea why. We walked for some time, a couple, three hours maybe. | know my
mother carried me, my father carried me and | also walked. | was 5 1/2 years old. | was a
little guy.

We walked to a place | recognized. On our left -- on our right was the major
street, and on the left was an 8-foot stocking fence. Now, for those of you who may have
been in Europe and you may know this, European cities which are not on the ocean or a
big lake use rivers to make beaches out of them in the summertime. This city is on the
Danube River, south of Budapest. It flows from Germany into the Black Sea through
Budapest and Yugoslavia.

| remember the place because that summer, perhaps two months or three
months before, | had been there. And inside the fence, about 300 yards away from the
fence, are hot pools and cold pools and wave pools and restaurants and amusement
parks. A very nice place in the summertime. This is December. The place is shut down
because this is -- you know, this is not beach weather.

As we are all marching, kind of walking slowly, my grandparents had arrived.
Somebody brought them by truck. And we were huddled together perhaps a dozen
people or so and we were walking slowly in this direction. Again, in the direction -- and we
notice the gates to this place turn in towards the river. We still have no idea what's going
on.

There's some noise which was very identifiable, we didn't know it. As we get
somewhat closer -- | don't know how far we were at this point, 50 feet, 100 yards. A
policeman is standing on the right and he says to my father, mister, what are you doing
here? He says I'm here with my family. He said, that's not the point.

The point is that | know that you don't live here. You live in Budapest and | know
that because |'m a foot patrolman in your district. And | have seen you on the street any
number of times so | know that you live there. So being here and being counted in this
crowd would mess up the numbers. Can't do that. Step aside.

My father and my mother and our little group steps aside. I'm sure it was a
matter of absolute coincidence. As we are stepping aside, a minute or two later, literally a
minute to two, the staff comes down the road, a uniformed soldier comes out, has a
pow-wow with his patrolmen and says the requirement of the census has been met.
There is a school over there and you are welcome to get hot chocolate or coffee and go
home. If you are bewildered, can you imagine how bewildered we were. We go home to
my aunt's house. No idea what happened. The phone calls start to come in. We had
phones. My aunt calls and she says where were you, we had plans. We tell her.

The policeman comes to the door and said | would do a census. | would do

what | would normally do. My aunt invited them in and gave them coffee and cake. 17
cakes, 19 coffees, and they had the best breakfast coffee in their life. They asked three
questions and they left. And my aunt said, what's going on? | didn't go to the beach. |
didn't go to the stockade fence. The experience of those people if | had made that left turn
was a much more horrible one.

The government, in fact, took canon with which they cracked the ice in the
Danube which was yay thick. All those who, in fact, made a left turn were shot into the
river, never to be found again or if they were found, they were found floating underneath
the ice in Belgrade about an hour away the next March or whenever the river thawed out.
This is a Pogrom, a senseless, useless, valueless experience that people can do because
they can do it and you can't stop them.

something that happened -- this was retribution for that. And 350 people were
killed in the Pogrom of Novi Sad of 1941. | didn't quite understand what that meant but |
can describe the story | just did.

The next morning, | only tell you about because this is something | do remember
and meaning to me. My father calls for a taxi to go back to Budapest. Somehow, folks,
when there is a catastrophe around you, what you want to do is go home. My
grandparents with my aunts, | was perfectly safe but this was not home. Home was in
Budapest.

My father calls for a taxi and a one horse-power taxi shows up. Can you guess
what that would be? My daughter. She is cheating. A one horse-power taxi is a sleigh.
There's snow on the ground. The regular taxis had engines in them as well. But this is
what showed up and that's what | remember because, again, for 5 1/2-year-old that's an
adventure. 350 people killed doesn't have that much meaning but a sleigh -- a
horse-drawn sleigh to go to the train station is an adventure.
>> Bill Benson: Manny, I'm going to have us jump now more than two years to March 1944
when Germany occupied Hungary and, of course, things changed profoundly,
dramatically, and almost instantly. Tell us what brought the Germans in at that stage
because they hadn't occupied Hungary up until that point and then what happened from
there.
>> Manny Mandel: In 1942 in Berlin, in a place called Wannsee, there was a conference
called by the chief SS officer, a general in the Eastern Front of the German war. He called
for a conference where they came up with the particulars for the final solution to the
Jewish problem. It's a phrase that you should know. Obviously the final solution was
extermination.

They appointed a man to be the person who, in fact, run this is project, this
issue. His name was Adolf Eichmann. Some of you may know the name. I'll get to some
stories about him a little bit later. But Eichmann, in fact, did a very effective job. Heis a
midlevel officer in the Army, lieutenant colonel. And he, in fact, cleared the Jews from all
of the countries of Europe and sends him to various extermination and concentration
camps. You know some of the names of Auschwitz, Birkenau and so forth.

Since Hungary is an Ally of Germany, he does not come to Hungary. He comes
to Hungary -- well, doesn't come then. He comes to Hungary last. Now, '44, March of
'44 is very, very late in the war. You remember the D Day is June of '44. The war is over
in May of '45. So this is if you want to talk in terms of, again, football context, this is fourth

quarter.

He comes to Budapest on the 19th of March, 1944. And the significance there
incidentally is the fact that today | asked the people in the museum why they asked me to
do "First Person" today. They said because the 17th of March today is not reminiscent to
Saint Patty's Day, it's reminiscent that the Germans came to Budapest where | was on the
17th.

But in any case on the 19th of March, Eichmann arrives. As soon as he
arrives -- | mean, aS soon as some issues happen, the deportation from Budapest begin at
the rate of 12,000 a day. Now, | don't know where you folks are from, but also when |
speak to groups | find people from smaller communities where 12,000 represents the
whole city or the whole town or represents their school. And that was the size of the
deportation beginning immediately within days of the 19th of March, 1944.
>> Bill Benson: What happened to your family when Eichmann arrived? Actually, what
prompted them to come into Hungary at that point?
>> Manny Mandel: It was the last one that had not been cleared.
>> Bill Benson: But there had been some political change in Hungary, right?
>> Manny Mandel: That was perhaps the least significant of the reason. They were
coming as a consequence -- and in relation to that, the Ally connection with Germany
ceased and the Horthy, the region of Hungary, was no longer in charge and the charge
came from the Hungarian fascist government, the Arrow Cross.

But what happened to us is that almost as soon as Eichmann arrives two men
from kind of a subgenerated rescue committee, as they call themselves, insist on
approaching Eichmann. Ladies and gentlemen, you need to understand you don't just go
up to the Majestic Hotel and say | want to speak to Adolf Eichmann. I'm not trying to
compare the two. If | was in Rome and | want to see the Pope, | couldn't quite walk up to
the Vatican and say "I want to see the Pope." These people insisted and thank God they
did.

The leader of this twosome was a Hungarian Jewish attorney from the
Romanian part of Hungary, the City of Kluche called Kunszentniklos. Again, multiple
names. Who began to discussion with Eichmann a proposition that is about as ridiculous
as it could be, this was it.

If Eichmann will release a million Jews, a million Jews from the various camps,
they will supply him with 10,000 trucks with certain material, tea, coffee and other kinds of
things for the German war. Now, the problem was many fold besides the fact that it
couldn't happen. But the point was that Eichmann didn't have million people to release.
There were no million people anymore. Most had been killed.

Secondly, these guys had about as much opportunity to have 10,000 trucks.
They did have a bicycle pump or a hubcap, not 10,000 trucks.
>> Bill Benson: It was a completely audacious proposal.
>> Manny Mandel: Absolutely absurd. And they knew it. One of the two, in fact, is
sent -- he sent through Turkey to go to Egypt to talk to the British High Command to
discuss trucks. He's arrested in Syria. Spends the rest of his war in jail in Cairo as a spy,
survives the war but nothing happens.

The point of this absurdity at least was the beginning of a possibility. The
negotiations continued and continued. And do understand that these negotiations did not

begin with Eichmann. They were all the way up to Goering, Heydrich, Himmler. He was
number three in the German government. There was a man name by Himmler, the head
of SS. He was directly involved. But the whole thing had to do with the fact that Nazi
government leadership kind of smelled the fact that the issues of the war were not going in
their favor. This was around D Day already. The only last instance was the Battle of the
Bulge. The point was they kind of smelled the end. They were looking to find a way in
some way do something for their life after the war.

As a side bar, | will tell you that Eichmann, in fact, is not arrested. He is arrested
but he also escapes. And he winds up -- anybody know where he winds up? Eichmann’?
He was captured by the Israel Secret Service many years later in Argentina. He didn't
necessarily go to Argentina with our valuables that were collected because the trucks
could not be made available. Money was collected, significant money from all over the
world for a group of 1700 people to be taken in the 35-car train from Budapest. | will tell
you about that in one minute after | finish Eichmann.

Eichmann and his henchmen and the others used the valuable to establish lives
for themselves. You might know Dr. Mengele who did all the experimentation in
Auschwitz. He also ends in Argentina. He was captured and taken to Israel and tried and
hanged. That's the point, that's how these people found their ways and many others
whom they never found after the war with the kind of stuff they would collect from these
1700 people.

The selection of these 1700 people was a very complex issue. Everybody in
Hungary certainly whoever had any interest in that land over there called then-Palestine
which became Israel held various kinds of certificates for contributions made to the Jewish
National Fund. This is an organization which bought lands and which settlements could
be started in the early 1900s and through the '20s and '30s. For reasons | cannot explain,
the German government accepted these certificates as proof of our being displaced
persons during the war. And they served as exit visas for this 1700 group.

Folks, if you have ever seen a three-dollar bill, this is one of them, a three-dollar
bill. We were to be taken to a neutral point and dispatched from Europe because Hitler's
position was to get Jews out of Germany, out of Europe, and then out of the world. He
didn't get to the third part.

We were placed in this trailer of 35 cars. 1700 people, maybe 50 or 60 people
to a car depending and transported north. The leadership of this group did not know
where we were going and which port we were going to.

As it happens, we found ourselves not far from Hannover in a concentration
camp, nota killing camp but concentration camp called Bergen-Belsen. We were told this
would be a three-day R&R, rest and recuperation, stopped before we boarded the ships.
After six weeks of R&R, about 350 people were taken by the Germans as part of the
negotiations and taken to Switzerland. Guess what, | wasn't one of them. | stayed a full
5 1/2 months.
>> Bill Benson: Your father was not with you.
>> Manny Mandel: No, | will talk about that in a second.

My mother, my father -- my uncle and I, my father's younger brother and | were,
in fact, taken out of Germany by German troops, Rickety old troop trains and taken to
Switzerland. My war was over at this time. This is December 1944. The war ends on

May 8th, 1945. | will comment about that later.

My father is in labor camp as he had been from '42 on. He could not -- because
he didn't have the choice of joining us. Had he been able to join us, we would have found
space for him. He does survive the war. We meet later in 1946. So from '42 to '44, | see
him intermittently. From '44 to '46, | don't see him at all. After those years we had to
reestablish a relationship because there's a difference with being 8 and being 12, or 7 and
11 or whatever. So we did meet up.
>> Bill Benson: What were your conditions like because you were part of a select group, if
you will, in Bergen-Belsen?
>> Manny Mandel: Because we are part of a celeb group, we were the golden eggs laid by
the goose. We were the hostages. If they killed us, they would have nothing to negotiate
with. | mean, they would not have gotten the monies which were given in suitcases. The
valuables here were things you could carry in a suitcase.

Money was not an issue because the only valuable money that existed in
Europe then were the American dollars and the British pound sterling which nobody had.
But jewelry of every kind and gold and silver, rubies, whatever else had intrinsic value
were the barter, negotiation funds that were used.

If they had begun to kill us or killed us totally, which they could have done, they
would not have been able to get this. And that would have been a disaster for them.

As a consequence, although we had all the amenities that Bergen-Belsen
provided, we did not go to work. Now, an 8-year-old wouldn't have gone to work anyhow.
But we were in these barracks, in these compounds. These were the Hungarian
compound where we were all by ourselves. So there was the advantage of having a
slightly easier life but the difficulties of the kind of weather in Germany, the kind of daily
census we had to do, three, four hours in the mud. The kind of no food or lack of food
which was typical for Bergen-Belsen. So the conditions -- the sanitation situation was
horrible.

We had showers periodically, hot showers. And we didn't know the hot showers
were in our case hot water. In the case of Auschwitz was gas. But what I'm saying is the
conditions in Bergen-Belsen were horrible but terrible in the sense that we survived.
>> Bill Benson: | was struck when we first met and you told me about that, about that part
of your experience, that there were these attempts to really try to create a sense of
normalcy in Bergen-Belsen in the Hungarian compound. Say a bit about that.
>> Manny Mandel: Folks, the will to survive is a very powerful one. When we got to
Bergen-Belsen, we had been told to pack some food and whatever for the journey to the
boots, which we never got to.

One of the things that some of us knew about, maybe all of us knew about -- |
don't mean | but the adults, but when you take tin cans and you use them, you can boil
them and clean them and put fresh food in them and take them to a factory that we knew
about that could reseal them so they would be somewhat protected from botulism and
things like that. My mother had some of these with her. And so did others.

After we used the food, the supplemental food and very carefully rationed,
people decided what they should do with these tin cans is not recycle them in the way we
recycle but to cut them up and make jewelry out of it.

You take a tin can and you make earrings or bracelets or necklaces because

https://collections.ushmm.org

you have the skill to do it. Now how you had tools to do it | will never know. But, for
example, the cobbler had shoe-making repair tools. You could trade a pair of earrings for
shoes which you could then trade for two cigarettes for something else. This kind of
business and commerce began under the conditions of Bergen-Belsen strictly as a sign of
survival. People needed shoes repaired if they possibly could or a haircut or half a dozen
other kinds of things that you could do. These were all attempts by the people there to in
some way establish kind of a daily life for them that would be reminiscent of the time
before this situation took place.
>> Bill Benson: You got very ill while you were there, as | recall.
>> Manny Mandel: Everybody has two sets of lungs. But! had triple pneumonia. | don't
know how you do that. The problem with pneumonia, which had to do with sanitation and
being outside and bugs and so forth, the problem was there's no treatment available for it.
Today pneumonia is cured very quickly. First of all, you have pneumonia-preventing
vaccine shot. | just got my second shot two days ago because my doctor said | should.
But the point there were no treatments then because the antibiotics which were just being
invented, Fleming came up with Penicillin in the early '40s. And | guarantee you the first
place it was tested was not in the concentration camps.

So there was nothing they could do. We had 35 physicians in the group.
There's nothing they could do except diagnose, yes, you have pneumonia. When you
cough, it's going to be painful. All they could do is do some Palliative medicine. It doesn't
do a thing but it makes you feel better. They used mustard plasters. Anybody hear of it?
My family can't talk.

(laughter).

Well, you get some kind of heavy material -- | Know where they found it -- and
you get some mustard seed and you soak it in water and you soak this cloth in mustard
and you put it -- they put it on my like a dressing. Now, it functions as Bengay or Vick's. It
heats the body. It doesn't cure the pneumonia. But while you have the pneumonia, it
makes you feel better. That's why it's call palliative medicine. They did that to me about
six weeks. Obviously | survived because the body cured itself and | was healthy from that
point on. But for six weeks, | was flat on my back.
>> Bill Benson: As you told us earlier in December of 1944, for you, the war was
effectively over when you made it to Switzerland to a neutral country. And as you also
said, your father was not with you.

Tell us where -- he was in the labor camps. But when he got out of the labor
camps, what did he do when he returned to Budapest? And did he know anything about
about you?
>> Manny Mandel: Not when he returned. He returned to Budapest before Budapest's
liberation, quote-unquote, by the Russians which was a peculiar kind of liberation. It
eliminated the Nazis but created other problems.

My father's youngest brother was with us in camp. He was instrumental get can
us into the group. His named was David. And my wife and | decided if we have a son, his
name would be David. And David is sitting right over there.

My father was -- by the time that we left Hungary, he was no longer in territorial
Hungary, he and his group went into Ukraine for similar work. In '44 as the war was
moving in reverse for the Nazis, the guards and the other kinds of restrictions were kind

of -- not lifted but they disappeared.

My father and about 20 other men in his particular platoon, brigade, command,
whatever it is, decided to walk away. They walked from the Ukraine back to Budapest.

They walked at night. They slept during the day. They stole food wherever they
could. They cooked the food in exhaust of trucks. They did what they could to survive.
My father is back in Hungary and the Nazis were still there. He had some affiliation with a
noteworthy man, Raul Wallenberg who issued Swiss exit visas. He issued these Visas
which were about as valuable as a three-dollar bill. But the Germans accepted them. And
they used three-dollar bill again for the same reason. And those that could find the way to
get out of Hungary were able to survive because of Wallenberg's involvement. For those
of you who came to the museum this morning, if you didn't come on the 14th street side
but on the 15th street side where the plaza is, that's called Raul Wallenberg place in honor
him to have a two-block area. Fifteenth street was renamed Raul Wallenberg in honor of
him who was very instrumental.

My father was in peripheral contact with him. He lived -- he found our
apartment. And he was able to locate the man who was involved in negotiations. This
Hungarian Jewish lawyer by the name of Kasztner. He was able to after some difficulties
to get Kasztner to tell him that we were, in fact, are in Bergen-Belsen. Because the group
of special nature was traceable through the Red Cross. They knew where we were.
Couldn't contact us when we left Bergen-Belsen. And they talked about the fact we went
from Switzerland were placed in a children's home, like a boarding school. You saw a
picture of it. You had to be somewhere.

My mother was a teacher there. She was assigned to that place because there
had to be somebody there who spoke Hungarian to us and could speak German or French
to the rest of the administration. My mother had very good German from school and she
had passable French. The leadership of the school of the Heiden School was a German
Jew by the name of Miller whom we later met in Philadelphia. But the point is she was
there, she was able to take some trips -- she was paid a salary. She looked up a
colleague of my father's, a cantor, with whom my father studied in Vienna.

As a Swiss citizen, he could make contact. My mother corresponded with him
and corresponded to Noi and Noi talked to my mother. That was the contact that
established we were alive. We couldn't go to where we were and he couldn't come to
where we were. He did say when the opportunity came up, we should come back to
Hungary which my mother refused. She said she will never set foot in Hungary ever again
and she didn't.

She decided this is the original notion of the trip was to go to Palestine on these
boats. That's what she would do. She had no idea what Palestine but that's what she
would do. We went to Palestine in September 1945 on a British troop ship. We were
living there. My father joined us there in 1946.
>> Bill Benson: The war ended on a significant date.
>> Manny Mandel: You want my comments on that?
>> Bill Benson: Yes, | do.
>> Manny Mandel: Maybe there's three very important reasons for existing. The war
ended. It is the birthday of the President of the United States in that year. You recall who
that was? It was not Roosevelt. Roosevelt died in April and the President after

15 minutes becomes Harry Truman. | don't remember the year he was born. But we have
the war ending on May 8th, Harry Truman's birthday and, of course, my birthday is on
May 8th. The three important reasons for celebration of the war, Harry and I.
(laughter).
>> Bill Benson: So your family got reunited in Palatine, in Israel. What did your family do
to try to resume life?
>> Manny Mandel: My mother got a job being kind of a caretaker for a child. My father got
a job at a cantor. And my father had a particular thought in life. My father, as | said to you
before, came from a family of seven. Two of the women died before | was born of various
diseases in 1930 or '31.

The third sister came to the United States in 1914. My grandfather who was not
very successful decided that if my Aunt Helen, the oldest of his children, were to come to
Philadelphia to live with a cousin that would reduce his burden at home. And she did.
She came to Philadelphia, married in Philadelphia, had three children. Lived to be
90-some years old and had a very nice life.

But my father's one brother, his youngest brother David, was with us. Two other
brothers died during the war. So my father decided that what he would like to do in 1947
is come to the States to visit his sister who he hadn't seen since 1914. It was such a long
time but my eldest aunt never met my younger uncle. He was born after she left.

My father came to Philadelphia, visits with my aunt and was able to make some
arrangements which gave -- which was an idea that was suggested to him that maybe
what he ought to do is stay here and bring us over, which eventually after certain kinds of
negotiations he was able to do.
>> Bill Benson: How old were you when you arrived?
>> Manny Mandel: 1913 -- 1913. (laughter).

| was 13.
>> Bill Benson: My last question of you before we have time for a few questions from our
audience, 13 years old, all that you had been through in Hungary and then Switzerland
and then to Palestine.
>> Manny Mandel: Which becomes Israel.
>> Bill Benson: While you are there.
>> Manny Mandel: | went from war to war.
>> Bill Benson: And now you arrive in the United States. What was that like for you as a
13-year-old boy?
>> Manny Mandel: Well, besides it being fascinating and bewildering, it was also one
more adjustment | had to make. And I'll tell you about one part of that adjustment.

| mean, the subway in New York which is where we lived for the first year was
unusual. Budapest has the second-oldest subway in the world. Skyscrapers, Venetian
blinds, they used to be Chiclet machine in the subway stations for a nickel, that was very
interesting.

The one thing that was a major adjustment was that my English was literally
non-existent. English was taught from the fifth grade on in Israel, in Palestine until one
day the teacher comes in, if you know something about the history, you know that the
British were not our friends. The teacher comes in who was trained in England and says,
okay, as of tomorrow, we are no longer going to study English. Terrific. We're going to

https://collections.ushmm.org

16
study American.

(laughter).

So my English and my American was not particularly strong. Left alot to be
desired.

Now, to arrive some place and not know the language is difficult. And | can
illustrate by it by something. But there were bright people around. My parents were
looking for a school. They thought of a parochial school. That didn't work out because
they decided because of my English | should be in third grade. Now, it's not the question
of what grade you're in but a third grader and seventh grader and have little in common in
many ways. If you know anything about the development of people, the age of third grade
and the age of seventh is quite different.

We then discovered that the apartment we had sublet for the summer was a
block away from PS number 3 in New York. For you New Yorkers, it's in the village. It's
off Hudson Street which is the end of 8th Avenue around Saint Christopher's. We walked
to the school. My parent's English was not much better. My father had the best having
been here for a year. We talked to the principal about what we're going to do.

We came up with a brilliant recommendation but it was an adjustment. He said,
okay, the kid's in seventh grade. We will put him in the seventh grade. We have 7A and
7B. If he was able to pick up enough language in 7B, we'll put him in eighth grade. If not,
we'll Keep him in 7th grade which makes good sense. However, since we are teaching
Spanish in 7th grade, we will excuse him from Spanish and give him an extra study hall so
we can learn some more English. That was another adjustment | had to make.
>> Bill Benson: And adjust you did. And here we are today in 2016.
>> Manny Mandel: And | learned some English. (laughter).
>> Bill Benson: Very effectively.

We have time for just one or two questions from our audience. If you have a
question, we will have a microphone handed to you so wait until you have a mic. You will
make your question as short as you can, and I'll repeat it just to be sure that all of us,
including Manny and the audience, hears the question. So | think we can do one or two
questions.

Anybody have a question they would like to ask?
>> Manny Mandel: Not all at once. (laughter).
>> Bill Benson: We got one, | think -- there's a hand right there. There we go. Thank you.
>> Do | need to stand up?
>> Bill Benson: No, you're fine.
>> Thank you. | was just trying to see you. (laughter).

Sir, | don't Know if you know anything about the rhetoric that was going on in
Europe and Hungary and that kind of thing in the 1930s or whatever or if you studied
those. Is there any similarities in the rhetoric against the Jews that went on then as to
some of the rhetoric that seems to be happening in the United States today?
>> Manny Mandel: | heard.
>> Bill Benson: You heard the question. To the extent that you feel comfortable
answering that.
>> Manny Mandel: It's very difficult. First of all, I'm not an expert in it.

| would say this, unfortunately rhetoric sounds similar. But the goals of the

https://collections.ushmm.org
Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
17

rhetoric are quite different. No place in the history of the world that | know of and anybody
in this room -- | would be willing to be challenged -- can talk about the fact that rhetoric
was designed for extermination. Now, there's an enormous difference between the goal
being extermination and the goal being all kinds of other acts, good, bad and otherwise.
What I'm saying is the words may sound alike but the goal of the words was unique to that
period of time. And today's words don't have that as a goal. | hope | have responded as
well as | could.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you.

| think we may have one more question. The lights are so bright hard to see out
In the back.

No hands, | think we're good to go. We're going to conclude the program in just
a moment. | want to first thank all of you for being here. Remind you that we will do "First
Person" programs twice a week, Wednesdays and Thursdays, through the middle of
August. We will soon begin live streaming a number of the programs, | think, beginning in
April. So you will be able to pick them up through the Internet and we think that's a very
exciting development. Programs will be heard anywhere for that matter. So join us one
way or the other. Come back here or listen over the Internet if you can.

It's our tradition at "First Person" that our "First Person" gets the last word. So
I'm going to turn back to Manny to close our program. When he finishes, Manny will stay
up on the stage here. Our photographer Joel is going to come up on the stage and take a
photograph and we'll ask you to rise because he's going to take a picture with you as the
background to the photograph. Because we didn't have time for more questions,
absolutely feel free when we finish to come up on stage and talk with Manny, ask him
another question or just shake his hand if you want to do that. So we welcome you to
come up here and do that when we close the program.

Manny?
>> Manny Mandel: In my presentation to you folks and answers to those questions, | said
things like this many times. | said | don't know if you know, you should know, you should
remember. Working here at the museum for a good number of years now, | find that the
knowledge of history is abominable. It's a big ward but that's what it is. What | would like
to call your attention the words of a philosopher, historian about a hundred years ago.
Remember his words, those who do not learn their history well may be deemed or
doomed to repeat it or parts of it. And if any of you remember who that was, | will remind
you. It was a member of George Santayana who was teaching in California at the time of
Italian extraction.
| leave you with the words that say, folks, since we cannot learn from the future but we can
learn from the past, learn the past, learn history, all kinds of history, Holocaust,
United States, or anything else because it's the only thing we can learn from to impact the
future. | leave you with that thought.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you, Manny.
