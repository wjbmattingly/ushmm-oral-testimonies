it.
A: They were talking but we were in the country. Nobody was, we didn’t know. But when we
came back we noticed because it was September when the war broke out and then there was the
holidays so we couldn’t go to pray because they would come and kill the people. So somebody
was standing out on guard. If they were coming or something was happening so people could run
away.
Q: It must have been a shock.
A: It was a great shock and then a little later they started evacuating and attacking the
neighborhood. The rich neighborhoods. They tried to take, they planned to take stuff and like by
the end of the year, they evacuated the rabbi, the Jewish people from the expensive
neighborhoods. So people were running away.
Q: They were trying to run eastwards.
A: Eastwards but when they went eastwards they sent them to Siberia. Because they thought
they spies or they said they spies. Maybe they saw they’re not spies but the Russians weren’t too
wonderful either. But they sent them to Siberia and over there my husband came from a
different neighborhood, from the south and their whole family ran away cause they had two

had the barns. The boys broke it down. And we used the wood and the next year in spring we
turned the ground and we took the eyes from the potatoes, you cut out the eyes from the potato.
And you put it in the ground upside down. And we turned the ground and there was a pump
downstairs so we got to work. And when I came home from work I was taking care of the
garden, I was the gardener. So we had potatoes, a little tomatoes, we planted things. Of course
there was no gates so people stole they were hungry. But the potatoes underground was a big
help. To get what to eat.

A: You see it was hard there for boys because I didn’t grow too much. Anymore because there
wasn’t the food what teenagers eat. But I wasn’t so hungry because they used to give kohlrabi. I
didn’t like it. But you, I was occupied in the garden. I had this, but the boys were hungry. I
could have used another piece of bread but you couldn’t complain because what would they do
to, it was much harder for the grown boys.
Q: Were there many German soldiers in the ghetto. Did you see many of them?
A: In the ghetto. They were guarding by the wires. By the barbed wires. That people shouldn’t
run out from the ghetto.
Q: But they didn’t patrol the ghetto.
A: They patrolled it then the borders. The Germans came every so often. They came to grab the
people wherever they could. They took them to concentration camps before us. We were the last
transport and they take, took children. They took men. I had an aunt that lived from my mother’s
side. When they had the rations they came and they went into every house to seize the people.
And they took out whoever they wanted. Old people, young people. So my father we had the, it
was a small house and under the steps was a place where you could go in so my father opened
the floor. He cut the floor open and he made a hiding place. They shouldn’t come there because
they took children and everybody to take for killing. So when they were the rations we lived on,
it was like you see here, (gesturing with hands in circular motion) the streets went like this so
like you lived on this side of the street, on the other side. There was a small place that you could

go through to the other street without going around. So this place when they, the ration, when
there were Auslang there were --

A: People away. My brother bought a band as a policeman and he came to warn us we should
hide in the hiding place.

station. He pay something like a loaf. So he came so we went down with the children. Also was
an old lady. My father she could, they also were afraid they’d take the old people for killing too.
So we he dug it, a hole and from the center he made two like benches to sit. He put a piece of
board so that people could hide there. and we knew that if we heard the steps so we locked the
children’s mouth. He shouldn’t hear noises. And when they went away someone brought the key
and that we could go out so that we could go into the houses.

were shots outside and she imagined that they killed my brother so we gave up and we went
away with, but it was already the end. Two weeks later the whole ghetto was evacuated.
Q: Isee. So that’s at the end of the time. But throughout the ghetto time, you had so many small
children in your family. It was a risk.
A: Yeah who had to hide. It was a risk because they took away, they had no use for small
children, so they killed them. They killed them. We don’t know where they took them. My
aunt we heard, she had two boys. Her husband ran to Russia and she was stayed with two boys
so she lived not far from us and we took her in whenever she was all alone. So she’s also
residing there. And we heard that they took them to the ocean, to the boat to the ocean and they
threw this transport of people into the ocean alive. We didn’t know what happened but then we
heard from people after the war. That’s what happened. So she had two boys. One was nine, one
was eleven. And the husband died in Russia. He never came back.

Q: What I mean is within the ghetto during the years that you lived —
A: Was people yes. After work there wasn’t people that lived in the area you saw. You didn’t
have time to go because we worked.
Q: My question was different. My question was did you see people dying. Did you see people
hungry?
A: Oh yes, you saw people like skin and bone because they couldn’t live from what they lived.
And sometimes they were older people they didn’t even have the money. You had to pay for it
too. To buy it. So they thought and it happened that people kept the corpse to get the food. They
kept the corpse, people, after they died to, to get. They were hungry so they got the food to they
could live. Yes, they were starving. Was very bad. We were hungry in the ghetto. There was a
joke that was a song in and I have for you a good thing. A roll with butter that this would be the
best thing for you. You know like a little something. So the other boy answered I cannot, I
cannot laugh because if I look at my sick old father I cannot laugh and I cannot enjoy anything.
You know a child’s conversation was in a song they made up jokes but it was not a joke.
Q: It was through tears. (both talking) Did your parents’ personalities change at all through
these types of hardships.

you live for, for your family and to help people if you can. A person isn’t born just for yourself.
You were born here, but sometimes I need you, sometimes you need me but people need people.
I don’t know if Iam expressing myself.
Q: Absolutely perfectly. I’m just wondering how your mother and father took it, how they were
able to handle this cause they have nine children.
A: My brothers were, my brother was already big and the ones that were over ten, you know you
grow up fast then in a big family. Over ten, eleven, twelve, you already people. You had
responsibilities. In a big family somehow everybody 1s close. We cared for each other.
Q: Did that help you survive do you think?
A: Yes, yes. How we survived you know. Sometimes people ask how did you survive. Honestly
I don’t know. God wanted it, it was the way. Then when they sent us to Auschwitz and when
they shaved our hair, I didn’t see, I couldn’t recognize my sister next to me. My other sister went
with my mother, straight off then and I saw through the bath house where they were where we
took the baths and when they cut us off the hair. We were standing (points at camera), there was
big windows downstairs and there were people standing outlined and I think I saw my father
with the two, took, all the boys like eight, eight, nine, ten and my mother we never saw since we
left the train that brought us to Auschwitz. I never saw her. But the capo that took us off was a
Jewish police. My sister went with my mother so he told her don’t go there. This way they going
to kill you. They burn and they gas you, and they burn you. So she said no it’s my children. I

want to go with them. They took, they told us that the mothers will take care of the children,
which wasn’t true, wasn’t true. It wasn’t. And on the way when we went from the baths to the, to
the barracks where we stayed, there was a big road with puddles and they didn’t give us shoes.
So we walked on the road. Oh you leaving. (someone off camera says they are leaving)
Q: Let’s step back a little bit. I want to hear everything that you have to say about this but let’s
step back and paint a picture. In a sense you’re saying that the last time you hid under the stairs
in the ghetto, your mother was frightened because she heard shots.
A: We heard shots outside.
Q: So then what happened?
A: So she said, she was very, she was hysterical. And we were still in the hole there. The last
time we didn’t see until we saw him we didn’t know that he is alive. So my mother said to my
father he cannot take it what would be. So it looks like the end. So my father knew something
about Auschwitz. So we went on those, you could only take a bag, a duffel bag on the --
Q: So you left your hiding place.

merchandise and you couldn’t run with money. So he bought diamonds. So he get all the
children. He gave each one a diamond and I had a wisdom tooth here (points to jaw). I had a
cotton over. So I put one diamond. He gave me two. One diamond here and one here (points to
other side of jaw) and I didn’t know whatever he gave me. I tried, he said if you have to save
your life, give it away. Or if you need to get food or anything. He knew something what was
going on. So he give all the older children, the three older children, four older children, my sister
too. But she, and —
Q: Was this in the train going to Auschwitz?
A: Before we went off the trains he gave us. (both talking) In Auschwitz yeah he gave us this.
So, so I put one (points at jaw) here, but the night when I saw we went to the barracks. On the
way we Saw in the distance a white, in white uniforms a band was playing Vienna waltz. And in
the background we heard the screaming. To deaden down the screaming so the band was
playing very loud. But you could still hear something. And then my throat got so dry, when I
wasn’t hungry, I wasn’t thirsty. I was just feeling like I am choking. Because I knew what’s
going to happen. He said, he told us open that they gas you and they burn you. So I imagine all
this. And then we went to the barracks. You’re tired. I didn’t, we didn’t eat and we didn’t drink.
And the first night we slept on the floor.

on the way we didn’t get shoes. We just got something. They took away everything we had and
they cut off the hair and we waited there. They put some sanitizer on top of the, I didn’t

window and we saw outside lined up the men and we were only girls here on this side. So and I

A: One I lost right away. The first night, but one I saved (gestures both sides of jaw). The better

I didn’t realize that I lost this one so the diamond I, there was a girl. She came to the, to the same
place where we had the bunk beds. And she knew how to , so I was very scared. I was_watching
them so much because my brothers gave it away in Bergen Belsen for food. So they could get
something. And we didn’t know but after the war we met them. So and after, after we drank
coffee 2:00 at night we had to stand outside lined up in file. And it was already cold in Poland
without shoes. Some girls got like Dutch wooden shoes. So I put the foot a little on the back of

A: Through friends.
Q: How did he get there? How did he leave the Soviet Union?
A: Yes, he was, Soviet Union. He came, they came home to Poland with his mother and the
brother was sick. He had TB on, TB so he went to place. My husband worked very hard to get
him to Switzerland. They had a sanatorium there. So he healed.
Q: Did he? He got better?
A: Yes and my husband had already a heart condition. I didn’t know but somehow he lived but
gave us four children and he took care of us. That’s why I believe in God because we see it that
we were very helpless and who helped us.
Q: Is there something else you would like to add to your story for today. You’ve talked about an
awful lot and it’s only, in a few hours you can never get the full story of a person. But here we’re
close to the end and I wanted to ask, is there something else you would want people to know
what you’ve gone through, what you experienced and how you came out of it.
A: The only way I could explain that God took care of us because we by ourselves we had no
way to go to Israel because the children transports weren’t allowed to go in the time when we,
we didn’t’ have where to go and we didn’t know what to do. And somehow God showed us a
way. We didn’t do it by our self. So I, whatever happens to us it’s not that we’re so smart, that

http://collections.ushmm.org

Interview with Marcia Loewi 72
one is smarter than the next one, some people are smart. And it’s not meant for them to have
anything. And they struggle. Some people get very rich and some people are not so rich and they
have to make the best with what they have. But the main thing in my life 1s whether I did
anything good that I helped somebody when he needed me. And whenever I could, I was able
to. I’m not sorry. I’m only sorry that I maybe didn’t do enough. What we tried to do and we
could.
Q: Did you tell your children about your experiences during the war. Did you share —
A: No, not when they were young. Now I did. Now when they were, when they understood
already, I did. My husband spoke more about it, what he went through. And he was but he
injected the belief and he showed me many times in life I thought it’s not going to work. It’s not
going to be good. My husband was sick and I was pregnant with my third child. I didn’t know
that from the beginning he struggled plenty too. But everybody does. So he told me and he said
but you said he had a small heart attack. He was in besert so he said to me don’t be scared. You
see God takes care of us. And if God will want me to live, I will live and don’t worry. God
provides for everything. And he injected into the children the belief and trust in God. And we,
the truth and it’s a true thing that he could only trust in God because he takes care of us. Because
ourselves, we think we’re smart. We can do. It’s not what happened that night a friend of his
went to a wedding and he passed across the street to the subway to get the subway from East
Broadway and a motorcycle came and on the spot he was dead. So he said there is no insurance
in life for anything. If you are supposed to live and you have to live, God helps you. But if you
are supposed to die in one minute, you are dead. So then I said whatever it was, we managed

and life it’s what you want from life. You’re not here just for our pleasure. We have to be here
for other people and whenever we had a friend or my son went to school away to Switzerland
and aman came. He was also a Holocaust survivor without a hand. And the principal directed
him to our house. It was holiday. So he came. He wasn’t an easy person with one hand and my
younger daughter had to take him across the subway. He was scared but my husband said he 1s a
guest. You have to treat him better than yourself. And if he needs your bed, you give your bed to
him. So he injected it into the children too. And thanks to him we have good children.
Q: I think not only thanks to him but probably also thanks to you.
A: Yeah but yes, I did too. And whenever he brought somebody home, I never said, I always
took him with a smiling face and made them feel good. I guess I got it a little from home too.
Q: Thank you so much. I have appreciated that you took the time to share your story with us.
A: Yeah but I appreciate you. You’re such a wonderful person. There isn’t many like you and I
really admire you as a person. I didn’t know you but I wish you all the best. They claim to say
that Holocaust survivors have the power to bless people because they went through, that’s what
the rabbis say because they like.

the heads and scalps of innocent little children. That were born with defects.
Q: Were these, did anybody have family members perhaps who had been in that hospital. Did

A: Outside the ghetto. No I don’t, I didn’t know people that and the factory was you had to go
over a bridge to the other side of the road and the middle was barbed wire. And there a bridge
that was there that you shouldn’t have to go through the traffic. It was like a highway.
Q: And was it one part of the ghetto connected to another part of the ghetto.
A: Part of the ghetto yes, but I think this bridge probably was built before the war because it was
a big bridge. You went up steps and there was a walk.
Q: What was the name of the hospital. Do you remember.
A: Visola.
Q: Visola and had it been a hospital before the war.
A: I’m sure. I don’t’ know but I’m sure they didn’t build hospitals during the war.

big cemetery. Sometimes we used to go there in recess time. So we walked and we talked you
know but I didn’t’ have connection with the people. We just heard it and it was a terrifying
thing. The way they explained like they threw down the kids like with their heads down.
Q: Do you know was this also Polish children as well as Jewish children or do you think it was —
A: No it was part of the ghetto. So I don’t think that the Polish children was in it. About the
hospital yes. Yeah I don’t think they were only children that probably couldn’t stay home and
they needed the attention of a medical attention.
Q: Well you know the Germans had this euthanasia program with in Germany itself for Jews and
non-Jews but —
A: The ghetto was separate. The people from the city, the Jewish people there, they evacuated
and took off everything, the stores. There was a lot, it was a big city of 600,000 population and
300,000 were Jewish. There were a lot of hospitals, big hospitals. That rich Jews donated to
build the hospitals. There were three big hospitals. There was a very rich man they call
Koznansky. And this Koznansky built two hospitals in different areas of the city.
Q: And all of that was taken over and stolen basically.
A: Taken over and then, everything they pushed out. And you see people are mean to them

wealthy. We had nine children, but if God wants he gives you, he gives you to make a living.
You could work and work and nothing happens but if it’s God’s will whatever you touch goes.
So my parents had a beautiful home right before the war. One thing I am, I feel my father went
to a rabbi.
Q: I’m going to pause just for a second. It’s very important.
A: It’s just that everybody was so shattered by what happened you couldn’t’ imagine that people
did things to innocent sick children. Like this to children.
Q: Not to see them as worthy of any kind of consideration or dignity or anything.
A: So and then, you see this picture. We had in our bedroom, my parents’ bedroom.
Q: This particular —
A: Not this picture. Was a picture there was once a court and King Solomon was a very smart
man and he, there were two mothers and one, one the mothers had a fight. Who’s the, one child
was missing from the hospital or from whatever. And each one claimed it’s their child, it’s her
child. So the king said of the child and you see from the picture we going to cut the baby in two
and you get half the baby and you get half the baby. So he wanted to see the reaction. And one
of the mothers went how they said, give her the baby, don’t cut the baby. So he said you are the
mother and she got the baby.

they had a place for horses for cattle. So they, the people that lived there they had friends of my
cousin. He had a store that was selling wheat and food for horses and animals. So he exchanged
the houses. So we took the expensive dining room set, we took it to the ghetto. But once
somebody was showing, if somebody showed who was rich Jews and who has who might have
money, then they came to the house and they looked in the whole house. The children were
standing. And my father told us don’t look the direction where I have some, the older children.
The younger didn’t know. So we had like medicine cabinet. In that medicine cabinet my father
because somebody denunciated that were rich. So he said don’t look in the direction where I
have something because they look in the places and then they follow where everybody 1s nervous
about so there was in the bathroom was the medication we had some diamonds. Because my
father when he gave up the business for the first year they needed a textile factory to make
uniforms and they paid for it something. And my father had the raw material. Not finished
textile. So they paid something for it and let him stay in the city for a while.

people were, people who had where they could take things. People were jealous too you know.

had my, he imported like antique, you see like this Bloom vase I have here. We were importers,
we imported and sold antiques. You see I have here a Meissen vase and all this. It was mostly for
business but he didn’t sell it so I have it. We didn’t go out to buy these things. We had more
imported but we couldn’t sell 1t because the Americans didn’t like to buy silver and all this. We
had to give it away. We needed money. So it was, this is not so important but the dining room
set was nine, several thousand dollars they paid my parents. That was a piece of art. The table.

flour. It’s still in the oven, much of the same.
