So we were about 73 people, those who remained hiding inside, they didn\u2019t want -- want to go [indecipherable] and we didn\u2019t go before, but now they want to wait, they said they -- they have to go to the ghetto, you had to go home. And here we still heard the news from -- and we heard the guns -- machine guns, that they\u2019re still killing people. So there was question, you know, was like going to a ghetto, you going right into -- to the open -- to this slaughter. So the people were afraid to go, but they had to -- they had to sort of make sure to -- to stay. If they could stay, they would say if they could stay here in the -- in the place of work another night, would be good. So one lady came into my tailoring room with a gold watch and she put the watch down and said - she told me, go in and talk to the -- our head. Rudel is the head of the -- our officers, if -- to bribe This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

If they a -- the slaughter will go by. So I said -- looked at her, I said, you -- you know, you crazy, because I -- this man never came into me, I [indecipherable] he doesn\u2019t know me, cause the others -- officers work -- came in for work, he never came in to work -- for work. And so is -- but til -- she left the watch, she walked out, you do it. I says, that\u2019s the only way out -- she said, whether I could -- could do it, and think to do it. And I was sitting 1n [indecipherable] says, she is crazy. I mean, he never -- he never came -- he never know me -- he never came to me, and I can-cannot go bribing somebody like that, you know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ridiculous. Well, waiting, waiting, waiting, and there\u2019s no other solution, so the pe -- so people says, well, what can you -- what would you do? What can you do? Well, I said, [ll -- have no choice and I have to go, whatever is -- if -- if I wouldn\u2019t do that, you say, oh, if you would have gone, you have -- do -- did something, it -- it would have -- 1t would have been something. Now, we are really without any he -- without any help. So I took this watch and I walked over, this is one barrack where the officers lived, and I have that [indecipherable] everything over there in one bag. I walked over and I -- I la -- never was in this office, never went -- I knew more or less where the doors -- it\u2019s right the first door. So I knocked the door, and he says, enter [indecipherable]. So I walked in and Is -- was -- had to stand on the rear door, I didn\u2019t move. I just walked in, I didn\u2019t move, because his -- this room, the decorations around give you a Sc -- give you such a scare, all this Hackenkreuz 1s -- banners hanging and the [indecipherable], the Hitler and Goerings and everything all around. Is -- is just like Goering or something, or some other officer in his office in -- in a -- in the back of the room, and in a -- ina de -- on the desk.

One of your family, I don\u2019t know whether he was married or not, never knew. He says to me in a quiet way, he says take it back, I don\u2019t want it, I don\u2019t need it. [indecipherable] and I le -- I look at him and I was -- I don\u2019t see the same person. He -- he asks me to sit down, and you know what -- what happen. And I sit down, I says, take the watch. Forget it, he says, take it back, and nothing going to happen to you. It\u2019s over. In other words, this load is over. And nothing is going to happen to you, nothing is going to happen. I said, well I still hear the guns. He says, I -- I have or -- I have information, he says. So I walk out and -- with this news, and I told the guys waiting for me, and I told them that we could go home and nothing is going to happen, it\u2019s over. Meanwhile, we still heard the guns, we still heard the machine guns go. And time goes shorter and we -- we have to go soon, at six o\u2019clock we going home. So they said to me, look, we going to go a column with people, with 70 people. They don\u2019t know who we are or what ev -- what kind of [indecipherable] we have. See -- do something, tal-talk to him, see if maybe he\u2019Il send somebody to explain to the guards, you know. Well, I said, maybe they\u2019re right, but since I saw that he is -- didn\u2019t -- he -- he not, you know, the same guy is over there. So I went over and I -- again, I says that the people are afraid to go because they don\u2019t know where they will -- if they know what we are, who we are or something like that. And I said, if you would have [indecipherable] I mean, I thought -- as I thought -- if you would go with us to lu -- I mean, to the gate and te -- explain who we are. So he was thinking a few minutes. Okay, I'll go. So he got into his car and he drove ahead and we marched with 12 guards, of Air Force guards to the ghetto. And it was not complete over, but it was over. At that moment, when we came to the gates, we saw Mr. Isikson was led out by SS. Two guys took him and his assistant to their car and put them away -- took him away, for good. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.
