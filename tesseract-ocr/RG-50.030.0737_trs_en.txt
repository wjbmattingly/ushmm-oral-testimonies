A: Well, my — I had appendicitis operation, and I was put on the stage in school
during the prayer and they told nobody to push me or anything. And my mother
was coming to school, and there was a bunch of guys pulling me on the stairs by
the legs. That did it, my mother took me out the school. And you see, I was from a
farm, as my uncle, and I wasn’t living in Wilno. So the people from Wilno, the
kids, they didn’t like me, tha — because I was from the country, you see? People are
very clannish, immediately clannish. So they didn’t like me. And I remember one
time, one guy was giving me so much trouble. And you know those furnaces to

A: The other — the other 11 died already. One boy died last year.

Q: From that private school. But I want to stay with the public school. In that
public school, were there any Jewish kids?

A: Of course.

Q: Okay, and —

A: But Jewish kids were mostly in Jewish schools. Wilno had Jewish schools,
Jewish universities, Jewish everything. It was a big cultural center of Judaism. You
know, in Poland there were what, three and a half million Jews, supposedly. That
was 10 percent of Polish population. So it was a great — what — what remain of
Judaism. A lot of it was saved be — by being in Poland. The only thing, the Jews

That’s my opinion from my experience.

out in the classroom, or play out outside of the classroom?

A: Territorial almost, you know, and that exists everywhere that you go, and 1s
between the nations. Now that I’m old, I realize it. I remember that when all — later
on from India, I was sent to Africa, to Uganda, to a camp — Polish refugee camp.
And the boys who are there, from India that came, and they said to me, you know,
we can’t even go to a dance. This — Ugandan [indecipherable] won’t accept us,
they call us. They call us Indians, and they don’t want us. They were there maybe
four or five years in that camp, and we just came over. And I remember I came
over and I met a very [indecipherable] girl, you know, and I went over there, and
some of the guys from India went over there, and I learned to fight pretty well in
India. And I asked them, who is the leader of those boys? And they told me, well I
dance, and I hit him so hard dancing polka, that he fell down. I stood over him, I
said, do you want more, or no? And he said no. And our boys got up and they could
already dance and play. But this is the clannishness of people. They were
considering themselves African and we were Indians already to them.

Q: And you’re already Pole — and your always — you were all Poles.

A: And we were all Poles or from Russia. But you see, this 1s clannishness, this 1s
unbelievable in people. I notice it everywhere. Everywhere I notice it, clannish.

taken. In this car where we were, there was one Jewish nurse. I don’t know, she
was very nice girl, and maybe she saved my life, I’ll tell you, because I got mumps,

she was a hospital nurse and she says, I have syringe. So she brought it, she took it

Maybe I would have been all right. But she was — she was the only Jewish person

prostitutes too. They took prostitutes too, they later had problem with them in

destroy them, but they also want to destroy everybody else. It’s madness. This

the Polish people, they’re older, they knew the railroad station that we were going.
And once a day or — or something, they used to open the door and they took four
men with buckets to bring in some food, and they used to give us bread. But that
bread was so bad that if you threw it against the wall 1t would stick to the wall. It
was like thing — w-we — we took some food with us from Poland, thank God, you

Russians were standing, begging for food. What did they expect? People that are

got some money from the government, and we can help. And — and the rabbi gave

going on over there that nobody knew, that what was going on, who was what, you
know? I — it’s awful, but ee — the people don’t learn to stop killing each other.
Those African tribes and in British. Did you ever see Kuwait on the map?
Q: Yeah.
A: When Churchill was drunk, as usual, they was — they were dividing after the
first World War. So Churchill drew a line like this, you know, one line like this,
one — they cross, and they are like this. So you know what this 1s? Here is Kuwait,
you know what this is? No man’s land. Between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, this big
piece of the lines that cross like this, it’s — on the atlas if you look, it’s no man’s
land, you know”? And this used to be a part of, once upon a time, of Iraq. And —
and amer — English designed the state, and they made a lot of everything. And all
those countries that are now fighting in Africa, they conquered the — different
tribes were living, and they put different tribes together, and they all hate each

other, and they are all fighting. Th-Th-Th-The world is crazy. They did a lot of bad.
And when you are — when I think of the Spanish war, they did it in South
America, killing, slavering, everything. A-Americans came, British
[indecipherable] Indians, who are savages, let’s kill all the Indians, you know.
Q: It’s a kind of sad note, and — to end our interview on, but I’d like to ask you — I
mean, I think we could sit and we could talk about many things, two or three times
over, but I — I want to kind of sum up our conversation today, and our interview
today and d — how — how would you think some — when someone will listen to
your story that has so many facets to it, that has both beautiful memories of where
you grew up and how you grew up, and then great, I’d say terror and fear, and 1—
and poverty, after the deportation. And yet, you see, you have so much variety in it;
what would you want people to understand, from what you went through? What
would you want them to understand from your life?
A: Well, [Il tell you something, always expect that something better will come.
When you get old, you lose it already, you know, but when you young, you look
and you strive, you know. Like I went to NYU six years at night. But I was — I
knew I was getting somewhere. There were people telling me, you stupid going to
school. I said, oh yes, I’m stupid. I had a girlfriend, very nice, and she told me, you
stupid going to NYU. I said, well, but I’m going to study, and I’m going to finish

this school. And you know, there were a lot of things in life, and you always look
for something. And I had one big objective, that I had my father who told me, take
care of your mother and your sister. And I took care of them. My sister died in
2001, you know, and to the last day I always took care of her, and I did everything
that I could to help my sister, my mother. And you know, my cousin, responsibility
for that. And also, in my life, 1t was funny, but I took care of other people. I was —
we were drafted into American army, and there was a Ukrainian fellow sleeping
about me, and he started complaining that he has stomachache. So I said, give me
your knee. I pulled his knee, oh, appendicitis. So I ran to the company headquarters
and I said, get me an ambulance quickly, we have to take this fellow for operation.
They told me, who do you know, what do you know, you think you stupid or
something, he’s goldbricking. So I went back, I waited 15 - 20 minutes, I came
back. You know, we’re going to sue you if he dies. He may die soon. They called
ambulance, straight from the barrack on the operating table, it was appendicitis.
There was a fellow in Korea, and he used to stand and burn his legs, and I realized
that he was so depressed, that he didn’t pain, because we had those Coleman
stoves. So, how to help him? He had very thick glasses. So I said, put your thick
glasses right next to your bag, and in the morning step on them and crush them.
And he crushed them. Doctors didn’t pay attention, nobody. They send him to

Japan, and of course he was sent back home. He was a mental case, you know.
Look at my wife. She conks out on me on the lawn, and I give CPR and I don’t
know what the hell I do, but she’s alive.
Q: And you’re talking about Francesca your wife?
A: Yeah.
Q: Yes, okay. And —
A: But — but you know, you have things in life, and I like to give people help. Not
everybody likes help. She objects to me when I talk to my cousin, but I try to help
them. They argue with me, you know. But I have more knowledge about certain
things than they have, and I try to give it to them. What they re — they refuse it,
they fight it, but eventually they’ll take it. Eventually they’ll take it. You try to tell
people, this is what’s important in life, this is what you do. And you know, a lot of
people gave up, a lot of people give up. We saw this — I tell you, I saw one thing;
Jewish people give up very fast. They break down. We saw them breaking down
more than we were breaking down, you know. I really saw that in my Jewish
people. I don’t know why.
Q: Where —
A: I’m talking about Russia.
Q: Okay.

A: They were weaker, I think. They were — somehow they didn’t have the
consistency or something, and we — because we saw them covered with lice,
standing in line. Often we were trying to get the lice off; they didn’t. And I
understand that once a doctor walked through a hospital and — with a group of
student doctors, and he asked them, which of these patients is the most sick, you
know, the sickest person. So one fellow said, well he — this one has this disease,
this one has this disease, this one has this disease. And the doctor said, you are all
wrong. Look at him. There’s a fly walking on his face, and he reacts already. He
gave up. He’s the sickest. And you know, people, if they — if they react, you know
— and I was lucky that I had a mother that could help me so much, you know, she
helped me so, so much.
Q: In what way”?
A: In every way. With the English language, and with the getting me to the schools,
you know. I wouldn’t be able, by myself to get. But for her, knowing the English,
knowing the French, they recognize right away that she was of a different class.
The English respect the class very much, so you know, they were conscious, and
they saw it right away. And then I took advant — and I made a lot of friends. In life,
I made a lot of friends. I tell you like in Karachi, we were — there was a club for
British soldiers and diving and everything. I got to know the Canadian fellow who

was running. We used to steal Indian boats and go sailing, the two of us together.
And then we’d steal cookies and everything. And one time, maybe I told you that, I
told in Polish school that I take some boys, and they went with me over there. So in
Polish school they didn’t like me because I was go-going to this, to — in the school.
Q: Cause you were miss — yeah.
A: So they loaded a bus or truck of children and they went over there, and they told
that we let them into that club. Of course, they threw them out. But the guys with
me came, and they could swim and eat and everything, because I knew this fellow.
You know, so I made contact. I told you in American Red Cross I made contacts
with those soldiers, and I have everything. So I always had some money, you
know, for these things. Then I ran photography, and I started making money on
photography. You constantly had to figure out something. When I came to
America I had no money, so I took a course in radio and television, I started
learning how to do. And you know, and then I didn’t finish it because I went to
Korea. But I le — I learned so much about electricity that — you have to ask people,
and you have to talk to people so much, because you learn something from
everybody. Everybody teaches you something. Sicknesses. If you sick, learn from
them what are the symptoms, what you have and everything, so you know, and you
can tell somebody too, and you can help, you know. You cannot rely always on a

doctor only, because s-sometimes you know you have to know a lot of things, and
the more you can learn in life, the better for you in life. And I think that’s what
interests me. The — only now, I have the seat [indecipherable] and I cannot do
anything, and I say, and I —
Q: Well, you di — you’ve done something amazing. You have — you have told us
about your story, and it is a multi-fascinated — faceted, fascinating story, and it’s a
true gift to give to us. So I thank you for it.
A: Okay. W-Wait, P’Il go and bring you some pizza.
Q: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I have to formally end. This ends
