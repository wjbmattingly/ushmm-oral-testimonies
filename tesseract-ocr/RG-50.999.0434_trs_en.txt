>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon, and welcome to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
My name is Bill Benson. | am the host of the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for
joining us. We are in our 14th year of the First Person program. Our First Person today is Mrs. Rita
Rubinstein, whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the generosity of the Louis Franklin
Smith Foundation, to whom we are grateful for again sponsoring First Person. I'm very pleased to
say Mr. Louis Smith is here with us today.

[Applause]
Thank you, Louis.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the Holocaust who share with
us their firsthand accounts of their experience during the Holocaust. Each First Person guest serves
as a volunteer here at this museum. Our program will continue until mid August. The museum's
website at www.ushmm.org provides information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.
Rita Rubinstein will share with us her First Person account of her experience during the Holocaust
and as a survivor for about 45 minutes. If we have time toward the end of our program, you will have
an opportunity to ask Rita a few questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What you are about to hear
from Rita is one individual's account of the Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation to
help with her introduction. We begin with this portrait of Rita, shown here between her Aunt Bella and
her cousin, Bayla Shulwolf, who perished in the Holocaust.

Rita was born Rifka Lifschitz in 1936 in Vascauti, Romania. The arrow on this map points to

Vascauti.

Here we see an engagement photograph of Rita's parent, Tabel and Avraha. Rita's father ran
a dry goods store and small factory with his sister and brother-in-law. The small factory had looms to
weave native Ukrainian clothing that was then sold in the store. The house on the right side was the
store as well as the family home.

In 1940, the Soviet Army marched into Vascauti and drafted young men, including Rita's
father, into the army. When Axis troops invaded the Soviet Union the next year, Romanian soldiers
entered Vascauti and told all the Jews to prepare to leave within 24 hours. Rita's family was able to
bribe Romanian soldiers who took the family to a ghetto in Transnistria. The area known as
Transnistria is shown on this map. Once there, a village family took Rita's family in. Rita was able to
attend a small class, but during the three years the family lived in the ghetto they faced terrible
hardships. After they were liberated the family was eventually able to return home.

After the war, Rita attended a Ukrainian school in what had become communist Romania. By
obtaining false papers, Rita, her mother and her aunt were able to travel from Romania to a displaced
persons camp in Germany that was administered by the US Army. Here we see Rita in her Purim
costume.

Rita arrived in the United States in 1949 with her mother and her mother's husband, an
Auschwitz survivor, whom she met in the displaced persons camp. They settled in New York City.
Rita married Nathan Rubinstein in 1959. She graduated from Brooklyn College in 1960, then she and
Nathan moved to Maryland, where Rita began teaching elementary school in Olney, Maryland, just
outside of Washington, DC.

She left teaching to have and raise their three daughters, Nina, Sheri and Rene. When
the girls were older, Rita began teaching at a Yiddish Hebrew school, then later became its principal.
After retiring from the school, Rita became a private tutor for bar and bat mitzvahs, including for
adults who haven't had their bar and bat mitzvahs.

Nathan passed away at age 58 in 1995. He had lost most of his family during the Holocaust,
but he survived with his parents in Siberia. After the war, they came to the United States. After
service in the US Army, Nathan began a career as a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Research
Lab in Baltimore, with a top secret clearance.

Their three daughters have a combined eight grandchildren. Daughter Nina is an
industrial psychologist with two children. Daughter Sheri is an attorney with four children. And Rene
is a pediatric nurse at Johns Hopkins Hospital with two children. Several grandchildren just reached
major education milestones, and | hope | have this right, with two graduating from college, just this
May, one from high school and her oldest grandchild, Sammy is on his way to medical school.
Sammy is here with his mother Nina. Sammy, Nina, if you wouldn't mind waving a hand here. Also
with us today, Rita's daughter Sheri and her daughter Toby, who will be a freshman at the University
of Michigan in the fall. There you go. Thank you.

[Applause]

Rita is very active in the community. 14 years ago she formed a singing group, “The Happy
Matzah Balls,” which still performs at area nursing homes, senior centers and such places as the
National Institute of Health and the Catholic University of America as well as here at the museum.
She also sings with the Gaithersburg Community Chorus and her congregation chor.

Rita is a volunteer at a local hospice, and has traveled to Israel to do volunteer work for
the Israeli army, and volunteers here at the museum as well by translating documents and videos of
survivor experiences during the Holocaust from Yiddish to English. She is speaking more publicly
more frequently about her Holocaust experience, including recently at a high school and an
elementary school.

With that, I'd like to ask you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mrs. Rita Rubinstein.
[Applause]

Rita, thank you so much for joining us, being willing to be our First Person. We have an hour
and a great deal for you to share with us. We'll start. Although World War II began with Germany
invading Poland in September 1939, the war didn't come directly to your community in Romania until
1940. Before we turn to the war years and your life during the Holocaust, tell us what your family's
life was like, their community, and even your early years before the war began for you.
>>| came from a very happy, loving family. My mother came from a small town. She was the eldest
of eight children. Two siblings had died before the war. She was the first to get married, first to have
a grandchild. | was the only grandchild. So you can imagine | was a little spoiled and adored. But it
didn't last very long, only four years of my life.

My father was one of four children. His mom was widowed in World War I, so the older two
immigrated to the United States way before World War Il. They were 16 and 18 and worked in
sweatshops, like I'm sure many of your relatives had as beginnings.

We lived -- when my mother married, we lived in a two-family home that we shared with my

father's sister and he established a sort of textile business. He had weaving looms, and they had a
dry goods store where they sold costumes that the local Ukrainians were wearing.
>> Bill Benson: Before you go any further, since you mentioned that, tell us about the photograph.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes, if you look at the new exhibits, "They Were Our Neighbors, Our Friends," as
you come in on the right-hand side, the second picture has been blown up for one of the photographs
that | have of my father, his sister and a brother-in-law who came to visit from the United States. It is
on the right-hand side, and it's the second picture. It has no captions, but you will see native
costumes, and in the back you will see Europeans wearing bow ties. My father was one of those with
the hat on.
>> Bill Benson: In fact, that exhibit, "Some Were Neighbors," is right outside our door, to the right.
You walk into the front part, the second picture on the right.
>> Rita Rubinstein: My father's mother lived with us. Thanks to her, my first language really was
Yiddish. Most of the people in our town spoke German to their children, Jewish people, but they
thought it was more intellectual. However, my grandmother insisted that they speak Yiddish with me.

My mother worked in the store. She loved being a businesswoman. She had a nanny for me.
We had a very modern house: We had electricity. We had a radio. We had bathrooms. There were
no washing machines.
>> Bill Benson: That was unusual, wasn't it? Your house was unusual for the time?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Very unusual for the time. They hired a washer woman who came to do our
laundry. Times were very good. | had lots of toys, a doll carriage, lots of friends, played with my
cousins, who shared the house with me; my aunt had two children.

| recall, of course, | have to go back a while, like 72 years, my father taking me to services. He
was modern Orthodox, but everybody was Orthodox, but we did not wear any special costume. He
just observed the Sabbath and went to services. Very pious, very charitable, as were my
grandparents. My grandparents also owned a dry good store and they had an orchard.
>> Bill Benson: Your father had a terrific voice, right?
>> My father had a wonderful voice, which my mother said | inherited from him. He loved to do
services. | do too. | volunteered about 18 years. | did mother's day and did Friday night services for
them. Yes.
>> Bill Benson: Germany and the Soviet Union attacked Poland in September 1939, launching World
War Il. It would be some months later, however, the war came to Romania, when the Soviets
occupied your hometown of Vascauti. That was in 1940. Although you're not yet 4 years old, very
young, tell us what you can about that time, that period when you were under the Soviet occupation,
what that meant for your family and community. You were very young.
>> Rita Rubinstein: It was short-lived. We were limited. | was no longer playing in the streets. We
had to close the store. My mother's sister was lucky, she came to visit my mother -- well, she worked
there for a year. She was with us, and when she wanted to go back home, she was no longer
allowed to, which was her good luck.
>> Bill Benson: Will you tell us more about why that was her good luck later?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes, | will. The Russians a short while later took the able-bodied men and
drafted them into the army. My father was amongst them, and not my uncle for some reason. That
was the last time, when my father left on a train and the Russian uniform, that | saw my dad. | will get

to it later how we found out when he died. | was 4 and never was to see him again.

lt was a difficult time. Everything really changed. The mood was sad. My father, at the time
we didn't know where he was going, but at least | know that he fought against this.
>> Bill Benson: Maybe this will be a time to just mention what you brought with you.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes, | will. Since you mention it now, what you see is a prayer shawl. That's the
only thing that brings me close to my father. His spirit is with me. He's there for every one of my
grandchildrens' bar and bat mitzvahs, when a boy and girl turn 13.

My mother, amazingly enough, | don't know how, but she held on to it hoping that he would
return after the war. | have it and wear it for the high holidays. My late husband used to wear it. Now
| wear it for the high holidays. It's present on a chair. All of my grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, it's amazing how it lived through the war.

This is sterling silver. | always felt the only thing | had clean. My father was presented
with this. It's customary for the parents of the bride to present their future son-in-law with a prayer
shawl. That's what my grandparents did. Let's see, 78 years old. Pretty well preserved. It's very
close to my heart. | Know the museum had wanted it, but | said, I'm sorry, it has to be inherited by my
grandchildren, hopefully my future great-grandchildren.
>> Bill Benson: After we hear more from Rita, what happens after this, the fact that your mother was
able to hang on to that during that time just seems to me to be extraordinary. Just extraordinary.
>> Rita Rubinstein: It's very close to my heart.
>> Bill Benson: With your father gone now, off to fight for the Soviets against the German -- or at the
time with the Germans initially -- no, no, against the Germans, what did your mom do, and who was

with you at that point once your dad was gone?
>> Rita Rubinstein: My grandmother was with us, my aunt, and my father's sister and her family, and
also an older later -- older, probably in 40s 50s then. Young to me now. They were with us.
Shortly after the Romanians came back. That was -- I'm going too fast?
>> Bill Benson: That was June 1941?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Correct.
>> Bill Benson: German turned on the Soviets at that point. The Romanians came in, allies of the
Germans.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Definitely. Times were really bad. They announced they were back. They came
marching into the street. In fact, my cousin, who was about five years older than |, looked through an
attic window, and suddenly we had --
>> Bill Benson: Looked through at the marching Romanians coming into town.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. With a bayonet. Said, There's a spy here. We children were so frightened.
We hid under the bed. They came in with bayonets.
>> Bill Benson: Thinking there was a spy?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. Finally, my mother and aunt were crying, "He's only a child." They pulled
him out, "Please leave us alone." They left. To show everybody that they were back, they took 20
Jews at random and they shot them. One of the 20 was an engineer who happened to work in the
same office with my Aunt Bella.
In September of 1941, they announced to all of the Jews that we had to be ready to
leave within 24 hours. We could not -- didn't have time to think what should we take. So of course,

knapsack on my back.

My mother took some bedding, because we always took some bedding. And she was bundled
up. Whatever we could carry. We were told to meet in a marketplace, and from there we were taken
away. Didn't know where we would be going.
>> Bill Benson: When you were forced out and you gathered the few things that you were able to
take with you, | think you told me you were able to hide some things in the house.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. My mother hid pictures. Pictures are very precious commodities to
survivors. Survivors very often ask me, or people who suffered tragedies like recently, the fires and
the floods, they lost the pictures, but they still had family members. We were lucky we did send some
pictures to my family that we had here, but for the most part my mother hid albums of pictures and
she also had hidden money in the attic.

Talk about hiding, my grandmother, may she rest in peace, she had money sewn in her
undergarments, underwear. She said "We never know. This might save our lives." She certainly
was right. | will come to that later.
>> Bill Benson: Now you're forced, with 24 hours' notice, to leave. Where do you go?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Tell me, where shall | go? We were taken by train to a holding place. We were
on our play to Transnistria, but most of the people were off to death camps. That cousin you saw a
picture of, she was in that death camp. And family members died there. My uncle found out, my
father's brother-in-law, that some Romanian soldiers would get bribed and would take some of the

Jews to a ghetto. Even though they took the bribes, many of the children were thrown into the
Nester.
>> Bill Benson: The river?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes, very large body of water. My uncle found out where my grandma's family
was going, they were going to Transnistria. So with the money my grandmother had, he bribed the
Romanian soldiers and they took us there on barges. A Romanian soldier was holding me. | was
blonde at the time. | guess he saw the anguished look on my mother's face and tears in her eyes,
and he said, "Don't worry. I'm not going to harm your child. | have a little girl just like that at home."
That was one time | was lucky.
>> Bill Benson: Had your uncle not bribed them, you would likely then have been sent to a death
camp?
>> Rita Rubinstein: We were being sent to a ghetto, to Transnistria. The ghetto was called
Shargorot. People were taken from there to labor camps. My aunt was to be picked up by two
soldiers. There was a possibility for us, it was not strict, to go to a market, but we had no money.
She would sew for Christians after she came back. Some people sent some clothing, she'd get
money, so we could have bread once in a while, and some soup and potatoes.
>> Bill Benson: You're now in Shargorot.
>> Rita Rubinstein: In Shargorot. How did we live in Shargorot? A Jewish family was forced to take
us in. Conditions were very, very primitive. Remember what | told you about my good home life?
Here there was a Clay, really like a clay hut. It had one bedroom. They were a family of four. A
potbelly stove. No electricity, of course. And that stove would act as we cooked on it, whatever they

had, and also people slept on it, because it gave us warmth in the winter. The winters were bitter
cold.

There were no bathrooms. We all used, excuse me, a pail, to eliminate. It was bitter
cold and very hard for us children. And hunger. You saw death in the streets. We were the lucky
ones, because somebody took us in. The one bedroom, there were four people, and we came with
nine people.
>> Bill Benson: On top of the four they had?
>> Rita Rubinstein: On top of the four. But these conditions were good compared to Auschwitz and
Dachau. That's why it took a long time to speak to anybody. | thought, I'm not privileged enough. |
lost a lot. | lost my home, my childhood, | lost my family.

The living there was very, very difficult, but a child always likes to play, so we would find rocks
in the street. My mother made a rope, a jumping rope. A little kindergarten class was formed where |
learned songs, and | was thrilled to be able -- we learned some Hebrew letters and words. When |
was able to bring a piece of bread and oil, it was a treat. | was able to say, in Hebrew, that | had
bread and oil yesterday.
>> Bill Benson: You described to me, and you were in Shargorot for three years, living in the
circumstances you described, it was -- as hard as things were, there were some good times in there,
in the middle of those hard times. You were just describing one of those.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Right, right. But a lot of bad times.
>> Bill Benson: For three years.
>> Rita Rubinstein: A lot of bad times. What really kept me going, | was never separated from my

mother. She kept us and herself very clean. It was about a mile away from the house she had to go
to a river and wash clothes. | remember this incident, because certain things you remember. | went
with my cousin. We had a little rag doll made for us. Suddenly, my cousin said to my mother, "Oh, |
see a little girl in the water." Well, this little girl was I. | didn't know how to swim. My mother didn't
know how to swim. | guess | fell in.

So my mother took a sheet she was washing, and she threw it in and picked me out of
the water, but | was so traumatized | could not speak for several days. They had a -- witchcraft.
They called some woman, and she said something like "Abracadabra," whatever, she broke an egg
on my forehead. | couldn't speak. My mother was really concerned. Then suddenly, | guess her
witchcraft worked, | started speaking again.
>> Bill Benson: Otherwise, this girl happened to notice you out in the river, you would have drowned
otherwise?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Right, | would have drowned. My uncle got very ill. He had typhoid fever. They
stayed with us only about a year. Then conditions were very bad. They had to leave. They left for
another labor camp. Later we connected back in --
>> Bill Benson: That was your uncle, his wife and a couple kids, two children?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Couple kids and his brother.
>> Bill Benson: Five of them?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. Yes. They left. My grandma, in the meantime, who was with us, my
father's mother, she was very ill, and in the Jewish religion, and | think in Muslim also, it's customary
to wear white. These are called shrouds. She was sewing these shrouds. | was a child, | asked,

"What is this?" She said, "When | die, | want to be buried in it." She had a little packet of soil, and
she said that soil is from Israel, and it's customary for us to be buried with soil from Israel.
She's the only one of my relatives who has a gravesite. And she was buried at Shargorot.
That was very hard for me to see. | loved my grandmother. She said, "Light a candle for me." They
did not take me to the cemetery. Suddenly, she was gone.
She grieved for her daughters, and my father, who we never saw again.
>> Bill Benson: Speaking of your father, do you know if once your father left, do you know if your
mother ever heard from him while he was gone, initially?
>> Rita Rubinstein: No, she never heard from him at all, never a letter or anything at that point. That
was quite painful. | realize now how strong she was.
>> Bill Benson: To not only keep going, but take care of her family as she did.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Right, right. That's how we spend the years there, cold, hunger, but it could have
been a lot worse.
>> Bill Benson: When | talked to you, you talked a lot about remembering the hunger and people
starved to death. How were you able -- do you know how your mother was able to get food?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Well, with the help of her sister. She was very handy.
>> Bill Benson: She was doing knitting?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Right. That brought us some food on the table. But | remember seeing dogs
too, and to this day I'm very afraid of German shepherds. In fact, a friend of mine used to have to put
her shepherd in a kennel, because he would jump on me and | had recollections of them chasing

Jews. I'm afraid of German shepherds. | know they're wonderful dogs and beautiful, but it's
something that stays with you.
>> Bill Benson: In early 1944, the Soviets came back. They came back into Shargorot, the
Romanians left. Now your town is under Soviet occupation, as they're moving westward. What's life
like now that the Romanians are gone, the Germans have been pushed back, you're now back living
under the Soviets, but the war is still going on?
>> Rita Rubinstein: But liberation took place first.
>> Bill Benson: Tell us about that.
>> Rita Rubinstein: 1944, the sounds of war got very close, and the people we lived with, they took
their family and took us along with them. A family member had a subbasement. You heard the
bomb. You knew something was up. Either the end of war or the end of us. So we were there, and
a 12-year-old boy could not stand it anymore. He got anxious, and he ran outside to investigate what
was happening.

He got back, and he told us that there were Russian streets -- | mean Russian soldiers in the
streets, drinking and dancing and carrying on. People thought he was hallucinating.

Then we said, OK, let's go out and see what's really happening. When we came out, we saw
that, indeed, it was true. So we cried tears of joy, that finally we started preparing for our journey
home to Vascauti.
>> Bill Benson: The Soviets eventually said you're free to go, you're liberated?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Right. Then we took military trains that took us to -- it wasn't easy. We didn't get
to my town so easily. Bella, my mom's sister, went out to see what's happening in Vascauti. She

found a woman who had been a teacher in her small town. She was the daughter of a priest. Her
husband was a Ukrainian national leader. He connected us with a Russian soldier, and this Russian
soldier took us on a military train. He helped us to get to the town. But when we got there, our home
was occupied by the Russian military, and they used it as a warehouse for grain.

My mother begged them to, "Please let me in the house. | just want to retrieve pictures." They
gave her a very hard time. She said, "My husband fought in your army. Please let me in." At that
point, she didn't know that he was already gone.

They finally relented and let her in, and she retrieved the photos that | have. The money was
gone, but that didn't matter. We were poor, but we had our lives.
>> Bill Benson: But they weren't going to give you the home back?
>> Rita Rubinstein: No, no, no, we weren't allowed. My great-grandparents were living in -- they had
a house there too. This soldier, even though it was occupied, insisted that the people let us have one
room. So my mother and | and her sister had one room, and we were able to settle there. | started to
go to school there, a Ukrainian school, first grade. It was about a mile and a half of walking in the
woods.

to the school with my cousin.
>> Bill Benson: You're what, 8 years old, | think, at this time, right?
>> Rita Rubinstein: 7 or 8, yeah. Right. You're right. And it was kind of difficult. At that period in
time my mother also met some people from the village where her parents were. The Ukrainians,

these weren't Christian Ukrainians, she asked them, "What happened to my parents?" My
grandfather had a long beard, they were very pious, and they gave my mother a blow-by-blow
description how her parents met with their deaths.

In fact, today is 72 years. That's my grandfather. The memorial candle | put up yesterday.
Yesterday would have been 72 years for my grandma. With farm implements this same Ukrainians,
as you will see the exhibit "My Neighbors, My Friends" the same neighbors whom my grandfather
gave credit to when they asked at Christmas time, they needed presents, he said, "Don't worry about
paying me." They turned on him. They had him watch how they really murdered my aunt and uncle
and my grandmother. They kept him to the end, then he was killed the following day. They didn't
leave anything out. Here was my mother in her 20s, survived with her child to hear that about her
parents. Unimaginable.

My father's best friend came back from the war, and so we asked him what happened to my
father. And he said -- he gave us the exact day when he was killed while fighting. So at least | have
the knowledge that he fought the enemy, and he died fighting. He of course didn't have --
>> Bill Benson: When you were liberated in early 1944, and then as you just told us your mother
learns what happened to her parents, your other set of grandparents and your father, do you know at
what point -- because the war would continue in Europe until May of 1945, almost a year and a half
later. Would you -- do you know when your mother and the family began to realize the enormity of
the Holocaust, the enormity of what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Oh, yeah. First of all, there were very few of us. The Russians had invaded that
part of the country. Russian curtain we felt would set in, and it did in 1945. It was very hard to get

out. My aunt at that point was working in a Russian bank. We stayed there about one year, until
1945.
>> Bill Benson: When did your uncle return, the family that your aunt and uncle --
>> Rita Rubinstein: | don't have exact dates, but shortly after, because we immigrated. We went
together --
>> Bill Benson: They came back much later than when you were liberated?
>> Rita Rubinstein: They got out, right.
>> Bill Benson: Here you are living under the communists now, being indoctrinated with loving Stalin.
So your mother and your Aunt Bella, you were able to escape from communist Romania. How did
you do that? Do you know how they made that happen?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. We had documents that were falsified, saying that we were born in Poland.
lt was hard, but the underground, somehow they did it. And we got on a train. My aunt was not on
the train. The Russians were not ready to give up on her. They wouldn't let her go, actually. Then
finally, when the train was about to leave, she was allowed to leave. But our journey was a long, long
journey. It took us three months from our town in Romania to get to Germany. Because the song,
there was a song written "Tell me where shall | go? There's no place for me. To the left, to the right?
Every door is close to me." That's how it felt. Our goal was to reach Germany, where they set up this

government. We did have a holding place before we immigrated to wherever, of course the United
States and Israel. This was before Israel was declared independent. That's why we didn't have a
country yet.
>> Bill Benson: Question for you. When your mom was able to get the papers that said you were
Polish, why was that significant? Was it because then you weren't Romanian and they couldn't keep
you? Is that the idea?
>> Rita Rubinstein: . Right. What was also significant, all people are not bad. Thank God we had -- |
wish we had more. | can't say a lot, but we did have some righteous gentiles, and in the Holocaust
Museum in Israel there's a special forest, trees are planted in their honor, and they should be,
because they really saved lived.

true identity, we would have all been arrested. We would never have gotten to Germany.

went to Salzburg. We crossed many borders. We posed as Greeks, speaking Hebrew. It was really
miraculous. We were hungry. We were tired. But people took us in. There was somebody from
Israel who helped us also to go through the borders. They had their ways. They knew how. My Aunt
Bella met her future husband on our journey. They were also traveling. Their goal was to go to
Germany.
>> Bill Benson: Actually on the trip itself?
>> Rita Rubinstein: On the trip, correct.
>> Bill Benson: When you finally make it to Germany, you go to a displaced persons camp, and |
think you spent three years at the displaced persons camp.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. Displaced persons camp was paradise to us. We were finally free, not
labeled as "The Jews." Conditions were not wonderful, because we were in barracks. We had one
room, but we had food, we had canned food. We didn't know about the tuna fish; we were afraid to
open it and eat it. We would barter. My mother remarried there, and he would bring a can of tuna
fish. The Germans liked it. They would give us a chicken now and then, some eggs. We got food in
the camp, but it wasn't the greatest. You have to make it on your own.
>> Bill Benson: | think you told me that the locals with whom you wanted to get fresh produce, they
liked the canned Spam. So you would swap Spam for fresh food.
>> Rita Rubinstein: Right, exactly. We children -- you know, children are here, you say, Oh, do we
have to go to school? We were so happy that we finally had a school. We missed all these years of
schooling. | went to a school that was established. There were not many children, unfortunately.

| remember going on trips, putting on plays. That's when | started singing up on stage.
One incident which got to my mother, she was sitting in the audience as | was singing a song on the
stage. A woman said to her, "| wonder if this child's mother is alive listening to her." Of course, my
mother burst into tears. She said "Yes. | am the mother." She said, "You are so lucky. | lost two
children in the camps." You heard so many of those stories.

The camp too | started speaking Polish, because some of my friends were hidden. They
were good Poles too, hidden either in convents or hidden in Christian homes. Sometimes they didn't
want to give the Jewish children up. But they only spoke Polish. So | was forced to learn that
language too. When people met my mother on the street they started speaking Polish to her. "I'm
not from Poland. I'm from Romania." As a child you pick up languages, and | was very happy there,

case of TB.

At that time they rationed, they gave out streptomycin to people who had TB of the
bones, and | had it of the lungs. They said | would need surgery to collapse the lung, unless | got the
streptomycin.

Also, | wanted to bring out, in that hospital there were a lot of anti-Semitic nurses. Every time |
went for a test, they would give me a tissue and say "You'll need it. This is going to hurt." | said "No,

They were hard times, but thank God there was a very kind doctor, Danish. She said to my
mother, "Don't worry. She will be fine." What scared us, we knew we would have to pass very strict
exams before being allowed into the United States. They had Ellis Island, but they didn't do the
exams on Ellis Island. You had to be examined before you went on the boat. That is if you met the
quota. There was a certain quota from Germany. They allowed some people from Romania. We
had to wait a long time.

>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes.
>> Bill Benson: You remember that vividly?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. | had surgery. My mother brought the streptomycin as well every three
months -- | mean every four hours. | would get it for three months.
>> Bill Benson: Did she have to get the streptomycin herself?
>> Rita Rubinstein: No, it was sent -- yes. Sent by my relatives.
>> Bill Benson: Your relatives in the US sent it, right?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Right, right. They were hard times, but those times | remember very well. | will
never forget May 15, 1948, when Israel was declared independent. All the children in the school, we
stayed up all night long singing and dancing. Finally, the Jews had their homeland. We had a place
to go. If we had had that place before the Holocaust, then 6 million would have been alive.

>> Rita Rubinstein: A lot of weddings took place, a lot of births. It was life reborn, really.
>> Bill Benson: Why did you come to the United States? Why was that your destination?
>> Rita Rubinstein: My aunt was in a different quota, because she married my uncle. They left early.
She left while | was in the sanitarium. She got to the United States in about 1947.
>> Bill Benson: You had two aunts already living in the United States, right?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. Whom | never met. My mother had uncles also come here way before.
>> Bill Benson: OK.
>> Rita Rubinstein: So they wanted to go, because when Israel was declared independent, that's
where | wanted to go, but she said no way, because my only sister --
>> Bill Benson: Is in the United States?
>> Rita Rubinstein: She's the only one that survived and made it to the United States. When we
were finally given permission to enter the United States, which was in 1949 --

>> Rita Rubinstein: Yes. We were so happy. We didn't go on a luxury liner. It was not a cruise. But
as it happened we went on an army transport, the General Haan. Years later | discovered from my
husband that when he was shipped through Germany, he was a soldier, they drafted him early
because his parents wrote him -- we didn't have any documentation. His parents thought he would
be saved if he would be written four years older. He was only 16 when he was really drafted.

it. But unfortunately, | lost my husband at 58. | said I'm no longer 1938. All my documents were
1938. All my friends thought | was two years younger than | really am. But | came out, | came clean,
and | told them. That was the only lie | told. Even my family, my children didn't know, grandchildren.
| revealed my true identity.

The journey was horrible. | wanted to point out, we were right near the engine room, and they
were bunkbeds. My mother and | were sick the entire journey. It was September; the ocean is quite
turbulent. But when we reached the harbor of New York, | just can't describe the feeling to you. It
was this unbelievable. We cried for joy, just seeing the symbol of freedom. Finally, we are free, and
we're free to practice our religion. You don't know how lucky you are. We can criticize the United
States, but we have the freedom to criticize. And other places in the world you don't. Here the statue
was there welcoming us.
>> Bill Benson: You remember the Statue of Liberty?

you gave a frustrated person who didn't -- a young child who did not know any English an IQ test."
It's a wonder | passed it. | said, "Of course I've improved. | know English well." You learn the
language very rapidly without the bilingual education.
>> Bill Benson: You said to me that your mother was overly protective of you when you came to the
United States. Will you say a little about that?
>> Rita Rubinstein: First, she didn't want to talk about the past too much. She was afraid of losing
me. | can see why.
>> Bill Benson: Surely.

hand you a mic, if you have one. Try to make your question as brief as you can. If! think not

house, were they nice to you?
>> Rita Rubinstein: Very nice. They are very good people. They had very little. They shared -- they
didn't share the food with us, but they shared their house. When my uncle was so sick, he had the
typhoid fever, they even gave up their bedroom for him, because he was contagious. They were
very, very caring.

excited that somebody spoke Yiddish and sang Yiddish. Unfortunately, | didn't have him for very

her?

God, but she was very Orthodox before the war. She was no long -- yes, she kept kosher, but she

We'll get the mic to you.
>>| notice that you mentioned Danish doctor. And in the sanitarium.
>> Bill Benson: The Danish doctor was the tuberculosis sanitarium. The Danish doctor.
>> | happen to be Danish, not born here in America. But isn't there a special relationship between the
Danish people and the Jewish people? Talking about when Hitler first took over Denmark to get the
Jewish people out, and there was very little, as | understand, very little loss of any Jewish people
getting out. I'm told that the Gestapo or the German soldiers would check the fishing boats, and there
would be Jewish people in the fishing -- in the holds of the fishing boats, but they didn't want to get
their boots dirty getting out in the holds.
>> Bill Benson: The gentleman's question, it might not be one that you're able to answer. The
question is really the role of Danes and their resistance to the Germans and whether or not -- how
many Jews they were able to protect or save. | don't know if that's something you want to speak to.
>> Rita Rubinstein: | can't.
>> Bill Benson: Thank you. But yes, it was a Danish doctor that cared for you in the tuberculosis
sanitarium. Absolutely.

This is my husband Paul. | just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart, Rita. | am an
emergency room nurse in Rhode Island. My first experience with the Holocaust survivor, | had no
idea what was on the man's arm. But he was a survivor of Auschwitz. That was in 2007. | asked
what exactly was the tattoo. It was half of a triangle, and it had a bunch of numbers.

From that day of 2007 when | treated that man, | grew such a strength for the Jewish
nation and the survivors of the Holocaust. That's the reason my husband and | are here today. It
was an honor and privilege to be in your presence. He would not speak of what happened to him, but
he did tell me what it was.

To be in your presence today, we are so honored to be here. Continue to share your
story of hope for your nation, because people need to hear about the truth of what happened, and the
animosity against your people. | just want you to know, though | am not Jewish, | hold your country
and your people in the highest regard that there ever could be, because you are God's chosen
people.

| feel honored to be in your presence. Thank you for sharing your story, because there's
not many more survivors left, and this is a great privilege to be in your presence, and we thank you
very much for that.

not, look to next year for First Person program, if your travels bring you to Washington, DC.

It's our tradition here at First Person that our First Person has the last word. So I'm going to

wants to say hi to her, chat with her, hug her. If you want to, sure, absolutely.
>> Rita Rubinstein: I'll stand up. OK. | thank God that we survived one of the darkest periods in
history. I'm grateful to the United States for opening its doors to us. It is the greatest country in the
world. We should appreciate the freedoms that we have and opportunities. I'm proud to be a US
citizen.

| thank our men and women in the military for the sacrifices that they have made in protecting
our freedoms. We must remember the past and find courage in the future. Never stand silent.
Always speak up when you witness bullying and prejudice.

Unfortunately, there are genocides going on in the world right now, and hunger too. Help
those in need. Always take a stand. When you save one person's life, it's as though you have saved
the world.

years ago, and yesterday my grandma, aunts and uncles, and in their memory, memory of my family,
my father, the 6 million, 1.5 million children, | will continue to tell my story. Now all of you will be able
