A lot of people crying, crying, tearing of the clothes, and a big commotion. And nobody pays attention to me. When we left, I said to somebody, where are we? What is this place? And they said, this is a cemetery, and we just buried your mother. I was four years old. I was told she died from a brain tumor, on the operating table. So my f\u2014 we get home, when I stay with my grandmother, and my father moved in, and we were the three of us, because Grandpa died just before. And was a very difficult life, because my mother was so young, and my grandmother couldn\u2019t take the pain, and the sorrow, to lose a young daughter like that. So, we covered by rel \u2014 Jewish religion, we cover the mirrors when someone dies, and we did cover it, and after 30 days you\u2019re supposed to take it off, but she never took it off. As my \u2014 as long as I remember, the mirrors were covered. So, being that I had no one to take care of me, my Aunt Ella hired a https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Edith Palkowitz \u201d August 26, 2016 governess, whose name was Mimi. So Mimi took care of me since I was four years old, til right after the war. And we did everything together, schoolwork, fun work. She taught me lots of etiquette; she felt it was very important. She taught me how to boil eggs warm water, in case. [indecipherable] in case of what? Everything is good to know. Everything is good to know. I was ironing, I was washing, cause she did tell me all these things. And I was very content, she was very, very good to me. And couldn\u2019t be happier, except the house where I lived with Grandma, it was a very sad house. And I \u2014 the children didn\u2019t want to play with me, because I was always sad. And \u2014 and this is how the years went by. And I went to school, and when in 1944, Mimi wanted to leave. And we didn\u2019t understand why Mimi wants to leave. And she said that in her home, there is a catastrophe, and she has to leave. Doesn\u2019t matter how much she loves me, she has to leave. So that was an indication that some political change is going through. But of course the news was handled through the government, and fa \u2014 also the radio. There wasn\u2019t any television or anything, like today. So, in a quiet, buzzing way, we heard that the German army took over Czechoslovakia, Romania, other parts of Hungary, Poland, France, all the eastern European countries. And we heard this stuff, and it was very surprising, because we don\u2019t know this stuff, we don\u2019t know these things. Could I have a drink of water, please?

However, they didn\u2019t make us to kne \u2014 knee down \u2014 kneel down, or any other things. So we sat in the back, and we just sat there. And our building had three flights. One \u2014 two staircases. One was for the residents, and one was for the delivery and maintenance. And he keeps on pushing me, the soldier, and I\u2019m going to where I always go, to the resident s-staircase.

You go where the delivery is, where \u2014 where the maintenance men are. And he was very upset. And I turned around, went over there, and he started to hit me. I lost three or four teeth \u2014 moving teeth, was loose. And he kicked me down from the third floor, spiral \u2014 Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection Interview with Edith Palkowitz \" August 26, 2016 spiral staircase, to the bottom. So I had lot of bleeding. I cut my head. And he \u2014 th the order was to meet downstairs. When someone was injured, you stay here, one \u2014 were you able to walk, you stay here. So my aunt was very worried that I \u2014 I have too much blood on me. So where \u2014 why \u2014 where they gonna put me? So she licked off the blood, and she swallowed it.
