Beginning Tape One, Side A
Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer
collection interview with Andrew Glass, conducted by Gail Schwartz on
February 14", 2005, in Washington, D.C.. This is tape number one, side A. Please
give us your full name.
Answer: I’m Andrew James Glass. The James, by the way is from my parental
grandfather Jacob, who was shot by the Nazis.
Q: And the name that you were b -- given at birth?
A: The same. The Polish version of my name is Andrej, which 1s spelled A-n-d-r-
e-j, and as -- as in most Slavic countries there’s also, for children and friends a
dimunitive, and the dimunitive for Andrew or Andrej in Polish is Andrush.
Q: And what is your date of birth?
A: I was born November 30", 1935.
Q: And where were you born?
A: In downtown Warsaw, Poland, not in a hospital.
Q: A-Actually at home?
A: Yes, and I visited th -- my place of birth as it were, and that is a story in itself,
how as -- as we know, Warsaw was systematically destroyed by the Germans, but
my house survived, and I’ll explain a little bit later, if you care, why.

Q: What was the address of the house?
A: Six Lvovaska Street. That’s spelled L-v-0-v-a-s-k-a, and it is in the heart of --
of Warsaw.
Q: Let’s now talk a little bit about your family, the previous generations, how far
back that you know about and where they lived and so forth.
A: My family on both my mother’s and father’s side are Polish. My father’s family
lived in Warsaw. We have the names of those who were my grandfather and great-
grandfather and great-great-gran-grandfather. Going back I think to the latter part
of the 18" century. And I think my mother’s family was also Polish, although sh --
as a -- as a girl she lived in Moscow during World War I. My father’s father, Jacob
was a banker, and he was totally assimilated in the Polish culture, he -- although
the family was Jewish, they regarded themselves first as Poles and second as Jews.
Remember that in the Warsaw of 1939, one third of the population was Jewish. It
was very much of the -- a Jewish -- a center of Jewish culture and life. And my
grandfather was a very successful banker in Warsaw. One of the wealthiest men in
Warsaw at the time.
Q: And did he spell his name G-1-a-s-s also?
A: Yes, Glass. I think 1-in Polish probably the pronunciation is di -- slightly
different, slightly harder, but the spelling is the same.

Q: An-And your mother’s family?
A: My mother’s family, my ra -- ma -- sorry. My maternal grandfather died at 55,
although my grandmother, interestingly sur -- not only survived the war, but
managed to escape with us, and lived to 96, in New York. Her -- she had one
brother, who is still alive and he and his wife also survived, separately from us, but
are st-still alive, although they’ve lost their son who was born in Santa Domingo,
and there’s a story there, too.
Q: Well, now let’s talk about your parents. What kind of work did your father do?
A: Well, my father was educated as a lawyer, he had a degree from Warsaw law
school, and actually was in the same class as the former late Prime Minister of
Israel, Begin, although I’m not sure they knew each other, but around the time that
my father graduated, which was coincidental with around the time I was born, that
is the mid-30’s, Polish a-anti-Semitism became much more pronounced in degrees.
And as a result of that, he could not practice law in Poland. So I think he just
managed real estate properties for my grandfather, including the one that we lived
in, that I mentioned earlier.
Q: And wa -- did your mother work?
A: No, no. My mother, who is still alive, she was born in 1912, and so will be 93
this year, unhappily suffered from postpartum psychosis when I was born, so I

didn’t see my mother -- although I didn’t hear about this until much later, until
around the time that I was two, two and a half. Although she re-recovered quite
well, and in a very stressful time as we know war is for anyone, managed without
any mental problems. She’s had psychotic episodes since, but she’s come back
from all of them.
Q: How did your parents meet?
A: I-In this climate of what might be called upper middle class, or even upper class
Jews, there was -- e-everyone went to school together, starting at a -- at a young
age, in their -- their -- my parents are almost exactly the same age. And these --
Polish Jewish assimilated culture, as it was explained to me, people did not pair off
until they married. So they did things in groups, went into the woods to find --
excuse me -- edible mushrooms. Took vacations together, and -- as teenagers in --
at the Baltic in a resort known as Sopot, S-o-p-o-t. And then, in their early 20’s
they paired off and my parents paired off and married. I think my father was -- my
parents were 22 at the time. My father, by the way, was the youngest of six or
seven, I for -- forget, two of whom survived the war, besides my father, but did not
escape, they were -- they were in -- in the ge-German labor camps in Germany,
two sisters. And at that time, un-under Polish Jewish tradition, you weren't

supposed to marry until your sisters married. So this was an elopement because it
was a-against the tradition of the family. But somehow 1-it all worked out.
Q: How would you describe your parents? Di -- wha -- were they re-religious? It
sounds like maybe they weren’t.
A: Li-li -- my father was not an observant Jew, nor is my mother. However, they
insisted that I have a Jewish education and I was -- at that time we didn’t have Bar
Mitzvahs, we had something called confirmation. So I went through about a seven
year program at Temple Emmanuel on Fifth Avenue and 65" Street, which
started actually shortly after I arrived in the United States, and ended when I was
13.

A: I wouldn’t say so. My --

decisions which changed my parents fortunes greatly and to the worse. Pole -- the
Polish government passed a decree in -- I believe in the summer or spring of 1939,
which was aimed at Jews, and to a lesser extent at Germans who controlled almost
all of Polish industry at the time, that hard currencies, non-zlotys, held abroad by
Poles, had to be repatriated and converted to Polish money, the zloty. That law
was, as you might imagine, not totally adhered to. In fact, there is now quite a
number of cases involving funds that were put in Switzerland in secret accounts by
precisely -- by contemporaries of my grandfather who were faced with this
situation and whose heirs are now either receiving or just seeking to prove that --
that these funds were theirs. But any event, my grandfather had considerable sums
abroad 1n -- particularly in Switzerland and in New York and London, 1-in the
order of millions of dollars. And in part because he was a Polish patriot and in part
because he was fearful of not breaking the law, all of this money was repatriated to
Poland, and there were no funds in New York, there were no funds in any other
place. So, when my parents eventually arrived in New York with a one week visa
to stay in the United States, they were -- they were destitute, pa -- financially
destitute. Interestingly, my father -- a-as you recall, in 1939 there was a World’s
Fair in New York, and the ability of Poles, particularly of -- of people of means to
get U.S. visas to visit the World’s Fair was -- wa -- things kind of opened up, you

could -- you could get a -- a visa to go to the World’s Fair, and you could take a
ship from Poland or from France and come here tha -- in the summer of 1939. My
father proposed to my grandfather that he -- when this law was passed, that he sign
hi -- these assets over to my father and that my father come ostensibly to visit the
World’s Fair, but he had the impression, which was probably correct, that if he was
sitting in New York with four or five million dollars, that you could probably find
a -- a ways and means not to get kicked out. But my grandfather vetoed the plan
and I often wondered how my life would have changed if -- for the better or for the
worse, had he said, all right, go to New York, and if they had arrived in New York
in that fashion rather than in the rather different circumstances that brought us to
the United States.
Q: Did your parents ever talk to you later about anti-Se-Semitism that they
experienced when you were still too young, obviously to know about it, before
September ’39? Did they tell you of any incidents that happened?
A: Well, as I said, he was unable to -- to practice hi -- the profession to which he
was trained, but --

A: I don’t think so because they were living in -- in -- pretty much in isolation.
Now, I put isolation in quotes because if you have a -- a million fellow Jews in
Warsaw, you can find your way around. My father’s resentment against Poland,
which he held until his death in 1993, was really centered around Polish anti-S-
Semitism that was displayed after the war began, and during the war. And he wrote
many letters, some to the New York Times, some of -- of which were published, to
the Jewish publications and so on and was e-extremely active in Jewish charities
during his life and gave a -- a -- particularly the United Jewish Appeal. And so his -
- his resentment was that [indecipherable] resentment is that the Poles aided and
abetted the systematic slaughter of Polish Jews.
Q: What is your very first memory? You said you were born in November 735, so
what di -- can you recall the very first memory?
A: Yes, I remember as a very small child being in pa -- with -- not with my mother
but with a -- a nursemaids in -- ah, there was a beautiful park near where we lived
called park Lazienki which 1s still there, and I remember the peacocks 1n the park.
But one of my earliest memories is of the Stuka dive bombers bombing Warsaw,
and the noise, and seeing the bombs fall on the city and seeing the bombers,
because they were -- dr-dropped their bombs from very low altitude and they
would dive and then pull up and it was an extremely -- but the noise of the

airplanes and noise of the bombs made an impression for someone who was living
in central Warsaw.
Q: So we’re talking about September °39?
A: Exactly, we’re talking about the first two weeks of September, 1939. And I have
only very hazy memories of my -- our flight from Warsaw east. Mos-Most of that
is not recaptured memory so much as what I’ve been told by my parents.
Q: No, it’s obvious that we know that many of the things you’re telling us when
you -- before you were born obviously, and when you were very young is what you
learned fro-from your -- your parents. Did -- did they tell you that they tried,
besides the New York World’s Fair, tried to get out in any other wa -- any other
way?
A: No, my father was very much a man of the world, I mean he -- he tr -- had the
Encyclopedia Britannica at home, so he spoke some English, which was a -- a
great benefit. He spoke Russian and German. He traveled some with my
grandfather. I was conceived on a cruise to the fjords of Norway. So he was a -- h-
he -- the radio at that time -- and I remember my father telling me about listening to
the speeches of Adolf Hitler on th-the radio, of course. Warsaw was not that far
from Berlin and everyone had a shortwave set so you could listen to -- to the
German radio, and my father being fairly fluent in German could understand

Hitler’s speeches and how mesmerizing Hitler was, although he disagreed with,
obviously with everything that he had to say. So they were ris -- I would say my
father particularly but my mother as well, were resourceful people who, at a very
critical stage in the war, in the first weeks of the war, took some dramatic steps to
save their lives and my life. And we can talk about that if you like.
Q: What language did you speak at home?
A: Oh, that’s funny, because when my mother was ill I spent a lot of time in my
grandparent’s home, and that was the -- a poly --
Q: Glot.
A: Polyglot. Sorry. Polyglot household with Polish, of course, but also English,
French, German spoken, and I remember as one of my first memories actually, or --

my grandfather Jadush, which means grandfather in Polish, wh-when will I get my
own language? The idea being that I had to converse with the nanny in French and
with the maid in Polish and others in Russian and German and so I had -- I’ve
never had a particularly strong facility for languages, but as a child I did.

bombed, and did you -- again, you were so very young, but were your parents
comforting, did they explain anything to you?

A: No. I -- w-wa -- when the war -- as you know, when the war began in the first
week of September, my father, who had somewhat impaired vision and was also
Jewish, for both those reasons was not drafted into the Polish army. But -- and the
war began, either -- I’m not clear whether it was on a volunteer basis or on a draft
basis, was inducted into a kind of home army or home civil defense corps, who-
whose primary task was to fill sandbags around public buildings and to clear the
rubble from the German bombings. And t-to put up defenses as it were against -- ba
-- sandbags against th-the prospect of -- of other public monuments and buildings
being bombed in subsequent days. In any event this was almost a full-time job, he
just was rarely home, as that was reported to me. In about the 12" day of the war,
he was working alongside a stranger who happened -- a Gentile, who happened to
be a taxi driver. And they began talking about what a good idea it might be for both
families to get the heck out of Warsaw, since the bombing was continuing and
intensifying, and since the evidence from the BBC and from German radio, if not
Polish radio was that the G-Germans were coming closer and you could hear the
artillery fire from three sides. So the problem was that the taxi driver didn’t have
any gas for his taxi. And this part was always -- I never could get my father to quite
explain whether he had a stash of gasoline or he had a stash of gold, or he knew
how on the black market to get it, it was always fuzzy. But the bottom line is, my

father procured gas for this taxi. So taxi plus gas meant that both families fled in
the dawn hours of September 13". I think a day or so, or maybe hours before -- you
can check it -- the -- the bridges across the Vistula were severed. Warsaw itself
held out against German attack until the end of the month. And some people also
escaped by boat and so on and found ways out. But basically we left and traveled
east, around the time that that opportunity shut down. Others traveled south toward
Romania and survived, but we traveled due east until the tax1 ran out of gas, and
then we separated from the taxi driver and his family and we somehow got a horse
and cart and kept going east.
Q: Let’s talk a little bit more about your leaving Warsaw. You again were very,
very young. Do you remember that, and if so do you remember your emotions and
the understanding of -- I mean, you were just a toddler.
A: I was just a toddler, I was just four, I only cou -- one can has -- have memories
from that time, particularly if there’s an abrupt change in your life, and I have very
sh- shady memories of that time as -- but later on, that is a year later, we ended up
across the border in Lithuania and I do remember living in Lithuania quite
clearly, and everything since then.
Q: Do you -- did your mother ever tell you what she brought with her -- when a
family has to leave a home like that so suddenly, what your folks took with them?

Interview with Andrew Glass :

February 14, 2005

A: Yes, she did. They took nothing. And th-the -- in that there’s a story, because

my father’s pants, with -- the ones that he was wearing when they fled were part of

a -- atemporary exhibit at the Holocaust Museum some years ago on a group of

about 2200 Polish Jews who fled, who were able to reach Japan, and many of

whom, not all, but many of whom survived because of that. And so the point of

putting his pants in the exhibit was that that was the only thing he had and that was

the only pants he ha -- he wore f-from the time that he left Warsaw, I think, til the

time he arrived in the United States. They were rather good pants, but they -- they

saw a lot of adventure through the -- here and there.

Q: D-Do you have any memory of that taxi ride with the other family?

A: Very faintly. Just remember being picked up at -- somehow, and bundled in a --

in a crowded black taxi and remember crossing the bridges. I had never been to

Praga, which is the suburb of Poland that is directly east of the city, and so I think

I have a slight memory of crossing the river, but that’s it. No, not really.

Q: Did you have a favorite toy with you, do you know that?

A: [had no toys, nothing, no. When I returned to Warsaw, well after the war, and

went to the apartment that I grew up in -- well, I di -- I lived in til I was four, I was

able to recall the apartment vividly. I mean, exactly where my room was, where the

kitchen was, where the a -- the attic that was there which they didn’t know about,

divided during the communist period into six apartments, with a kind of a -- a
frozen glass partitions going down the central hallway. But the -- the -- arriving at -
- at the apartment house, I had no problem finding the -- the elevator, which was
still the same elevator, finding the apartment -- I think there were three or four
apartments on each floor, finding the right apartment and then finding my way
around the apartment, even though it had been substantially remodeled.
Q: During the bombing 1n the first weeks of September, was your neighborhood as
-- a-affected, damaged?
A: I don’t know. No, I think that the bombing was mainly around the public
buildings, which were a few miles away. Of course, 0-over time, and particularly in
1944, the entire neighborhood, save for my house, apartment house, was leveled,
and I may as well tell you why. A-Around the corner from the apartment house
there was and still is a gymnasium, a high school which became during the uprising
of the Polish Home Army, the hundred or so days that the Poles fought the
Germans, while the Russians sat on the east side of the river --

blowing up the city, that part of the city that had not already been blown up in
earlier fighting, or in con-continuing fighting. But the German officers needed a
place to live, or sleep anyway. And so our -- our house, which was directly around
the -- around the corner from the gymnasium was designated as a billet for Nazi
generals, and therefore, while it had a lot of bullet holes in it, some of which were
still evident when I returned to Warsaw in 1977 with President Carter, that was
one of the few houses in central Warsaw that did survive.

west while we were headed east. And this was also a risk because we were
evidently bourgeois, educated, and there were -- I would say my father told me, and
I have no firsthand knowledge of this, but quite a few arbitrary arrests of people
who they just didn’t like, or who the local Polish peasantry turned in, or whatever.
And that was a risk, so you really didn’t want to s-stay in Soviet occupied Poland,
and we managed to find our way -- illegally, of course -- across the border to
Lithuania where, once we were in Lithuania, the Lithuanian government accepted
us as Polish refugees.
Q: D-Do you remember any of the towns that you passed through, or did your
parents tell you later, or do you have any recollection of that part of the journey?

rather well received, and my father was able to actually earn some kind of living by
buying and selling stuff. And --
Q: What kind of stuff?
A: Diamond rings, and gold and people wanting to -- currency manipulation,
dollars and British pounds and so on. He was operating on the fringes of the
galaxy, but during that time there was a progressive tightening of the noose by the
Soviets. At first it was to insist on a change of government that was more friendly
to the Soviet point of view, then that government invited, quote unquote, Soviets to
open bases in Lithuania and eventually that led to a de facto Soviet occupation
much like the S-Syrians in Lebanon and then finally to annexation of Lithuania as
a SSR as the Soviet Socialist Republic, which it continued to be until 1991. So we
lived through all of that, and during the time we were in Lithuania, the -- the
Soviet presence and the s -- importance of the Soviets materially increased. Now,
my father, if I may continue, didn’t stay in Lithuania because he was -- and again,
he was very vague on this, whether he was in the underground, or whether it, as is
mostly presented to me, that he wanted to get his father out, who was in Warsaw.
So he made his way through the Soviet and German lines, back to Warsaw on two
occasions, and returned to Warsaw in the | -- winter of 1939 - 1940 and tried to
convince my grandfather to leave with him, and with my grandmother as well, and

they refused, and gave reasons why they wouldn’t go. The reason 1s that basically
they survived World War I, and while there were privations and problems, and
several armies swept through Warsaw, the Prussians, the Austrians, the Russians
and so on, basically civilians survived and were not considered combatants. World
War II, of course, had a much different aspect. And so the idea of going into the
Polish countryside, which was believed to be anti-Semitic and dangerous, th-the
idea of leaving his townhouse slash mansion was unappealing to my grandfather,
who was then in his late 50’s.
Q: So now you are in -- you said in Vilnius? Is that where you settled in
Lithuania?
A: Yes, but there’s a st -- there’s a story involving my father’s second trip back in
the winter of 1940. At -- by that time, the Polish Lithuanian border was patrolled
both by Soviet and Lithuanian troops, but not jointly. And on his way back from
the second, futile mission to Warsaw, he was walking along the railroad track in
the snow with the pair of pants that ended up in the museum, and he was a-a-
arrested, I guess, or -- by a Lithuanian patrol. My father said that had he
encountered a Soviet patrol there would have been no question that he would have
been shot, because he had no proper papers or -- you know, he was a Pole at -- with
-- at least suspicious, and probably a spy. Any event, the Lithuanians, according to

money, gave him his shoes, and was kind of held there for overnight, and in the
morning, not knowing what his fate would be, the -- the captain, who was
somewhat educated, said, we’ve been thinking about your situation and what we’ve
decided is that we’re going to ask you a question. And based on your answer to this
question, quite frankly, we’re either going to sh -- let you go or shoot you. Which

Roosevelt a Jew? And my father’s response, according to my father was, what a

Lithuania and that it was an unhealthy place to -- to remain and of course the story
of the Lithuanian Jews is a very sad story, very few, if any, survived after the
Germans invaded in June of 1941. So in that winter, he en -- made a really great
effort to try to get out and we were very fortunate that through a strange series of
circumstances we were able to leave. And it -- we may be described as a trifecta 1-
in the sense that there were three elements to -- to it, and if any of the three
elements failed, we would have not survived. The first element was a -- a
Dutchman who was the honorary consul of the Dutch government in Lithuania
and whose job was to sell Philips radios. And he decided that anyone who applied
could get residence in Curacao which was then a Dutch colony. Course, what was
not known is that the governor of Curacao was not allowing anybody to get in, but
you could get a piece of paper that said you had residence status or invitation to
become a resident of the island of Curacao. And with that piece of paper you could
then seek transit visas to get to Curacao. You needed basically three visas. You
needed a Russian -- Soviet visa, you needed a Japanese visa, then you needed to
cross the Atlantic and get an American visa to get you to Curacao. So there was in
-- and this is very well known and we don’t have to go into detail about this, there
was a Japanese council in Lithuania, in the Lithuanian capital, kow -- kow --

Q: Kaunas.
A: Kaunas -- named Sigahura, who -- who I -- whose widow I met at the Japanese
embassy some years ago, and who issued 2200 of -- of these transit visas to Japan,
which he did wi -- against the express orders of the Japanese foreign ministry in
Tokyo -- to Jews. And our names and the record 1s there, it’s on the internet, too.
We got three of these, and with that -- that was two -- two parts of the trifecta. The
third part -- and this part is less well known and deserves to be discussed in some
detail, was to get the Soviet -- permission from the Soviets to leave Vilnius and to
travel to Japan. And they were selling a package deal, where you got the visa, and
the ticket on the Trans-Siberian railroad, which at that ttme was something like a
16 day trip from Moscow to Vladivostok. And if you ask what I remember, I
remember that trip very vividly, because it was 1n the winter of 1940, and it was
very cold, and I guess I was tur -- just turning five. So the first problem was how to
get -- because the Soviets said, the only way you could get this -- and we needed
600 dollars for three visas, the only way you get six -- the only -- excuse me, the
only way the Soviets would do business with you was in dollars. And any resident
of Vilnius who was caught with dollars on his or her possession was automatically
shipped to Siberia, but not with a visa, and so it was a kind of a catch 22. You
needed the dollars in order to get the visas, but if you had the dollars that was

prima facie evidence that you were -- had illegal currency and you were subject to
immediate arrest. My father -- I don’t know if this is part of this -- I guess,
surviving the Holocaust, so we can go wi -- through this if you like. My father
came up with an ingenious plan. He had a double envelope. He put the money in an
envelope, and in the o -- in the outer envelope he said, this money is to be used
solely and only for the purpose of attaining three exit visas and tr-tr -- or rather,
transit visas to -- through the Soviet Union. And some of these visas were granted,
and some people were arrested, as I was told. And some visas were not granted, but
they were not arrested. Almost all the interviews took place around three or four in
the morning tha -- you were summoned to the KGB headquarters where all this
was happening in downtown Vilnius. And among the questions that were asked
was, if you do go to the new world, if you do get to the United States, w-would
you be interested in helping us, helping the great Soviet Union complete its
mission of liberating the world. In other words, would you s -- become a -- a spy,
or an agent. So this was a very difficult time. And the third part of this trifecta, I
think my father is proudest of having navigated that particular rapids. And so we
did get those visas, and we did go to Moscow, I do remember Moscow in 1941.
Q: Let’s back up a little bit. So you’re -- before you get onto the Trans-Siberian
railroad, do you have any other memories of Vilnius?

distance from the railhead to the pier, where the Japanese ship was going to take us

Q: So there were 2200 Jews on this train leaving?
A: Oh, no, no, no, there might have been at most several hundred, but there were
2200 exit visas issued. So not all the people who got exit visas got Soviet vi -- not
all the people who got -- excuse me -- not all the people who got transit visas from
Sigahura made it t-through Russia. Some didn’t try, some tried and couldn’t and
th-the -- the visas were staggered over some time and so the departures were
staggered over some time. So we were, I think, toward the middle, but I -- th-that’s
a -- I’m not sure of that.
Q: So what -- when did you actually leave? When did the train depart? Do you
know the date?
A: Pretty much. Backing up, we left Japan [buzzer] [inaudible] -- we left Japan
in 1941. We left Japan in the latter part of April 1941 on the Kamakura Maru to
sail to Honolulu and eventually to San Francisco, arriving in San Francisco, |
think, in early May of 1941. We arrived in Japan in December of 1940, and we
were in the Soviet Union about two months until we got the train, so that meant

year after the war began.

Q: Did you sleep in beds?

A: No, no, there was a -- second class cars and -- but I remember arriving in -- the
Russian winter, as you know, starts fairly early, so it was the latter part of
November, 1940, in Novosibirsk where the train stopped, and it was about 40
below. And the only thing for sale at the station, which I bought, or was bought for
me, was moroshne, ice cream. It was, I think an interesting -- I’ve later been back
to Novosibirsk and remembered that.

A: I-I don’t remember being cold. And we were there basically during the spring,
summer and fall, so we were there during the warm weather.
Q: And you always had enough food?
A: We always had enough food. And a -- and a -- a sense of I -- sort of suspended
animation. I mean, remember my father was -- and mother were 28 at the time. So
they were just young people, and they were gaming the system, to try to figure out
how to survive, and -- and did.
Q: So now you’ ve gotten off the train in Vladivostok?
A: Oh, there’s also an interesting story about that, which 1s that there was a small
group of Jews living in Japan as traders, who had been there for quite -- quite
some time and were [indecipherable]. And the Japanese required a rather large
bond, a security bond, or -- for each person who got off the boat, to ensure that they
would not become dependents of the Japanese state, or to ensure that they would
leave when their Japanese visas expired, or whatever. Anyway, they had to come
up with a lot of money per capita tax or bond. And there -- somehow, there was --
the last guy off the boat was a Gentile and had somehow got mixed in with this
group of yeshiva people and with my parents, who were traveling. I would say
there were maybe 300 people on the boat, that would be about right.

correct?
A: All the people on the boat were the ones who had reached Vladivostok from
Moscow on the train, which took 15 days to cross.
Q: Wh -- wa -- were there other children on the train that you played with or talked
to?
A: I don’t remember any, no, no, I don’t re -- there may have been, but I don’t
remember any. I remember children on the Kamakura Maru because there was
also a -- a zoo that was traveling to San Francisco -- or not a zoo, a circus, and
there were tigers and lions in cages on the -- on the deck and so I remember playing
with the kids and with -- with the wild animals as it were, but -- and seeing how
close we could come without getting swiped. But just to finish, so these -- so my
father again, told me the story that this one Gentile fellow, who somehow was also
a refugee, but wasn’t affected -- didn’t -- didn’t have the same story as we did, th-
th-the Japanese -- th-the -- the Jewish Japanese said okay, we’ll take him too. In
other words, why -- why would we send him back to Russia? Even though he’s not
Jewish, we’ll take care of him.

A: Well, I remember Japan very clearly. This is, of course, pre-war Japan. I
remember downtown Tokyo very well. And I remember, in fact, riding in a trolley
car, they had green trolley cars and we were passing the imperial palace, the trolley
car passed in front of the palace, and all of the ri -- passengers got out of their seats
and bowed in the direction of the palaces toward the emperor. And I remember
asking my mother why weren’t we bowing too, and said well that’s, you know --
she said something in the effect -- effectively, that’s not our thing, that’s the local
thing and we don’t do that. But I remember the department store Takashima,
where there was a 14 story department store that was -- had a -- a three story slide
on the roof, and how exciting it was for me to slide -- walk up the ladder -- and my
parents let me do it, slide down these three stories, so -- that was a time when my
father’s main occupation was finding a way out of Japan. And he managed to do
so by getting a residence visa to the Dominican Republic, who were -- at that time
the dictator of the Dominican Republic, Trujillo was interested in Europeanizing
and bringing in educated Europeans into -- into the -- Hispaniola. And so we were
granted three visas, residence visas to the Dominican Republic, and on the basis of
that visa, we got one week transit visas from the American consul in Tokyo. So
that when we got off the Kamakura Maru, we could get on a train in San

take a ship to the Dominican Republic, but we never did that.

A: No. No, I didn’t. I mean, I knew I was crossing the Pacific Ocean and I have

very clear memories of -- of Pearl Harbor and Honolulu when the ship docked

there for a couple of days, bu-but -- before it went on.

Q: Well again, I -- obviously you still were very young. Did the United States

mean anything? Did America have any meaning for you in any sense?

A: No, not at all, 1t was just the great adventure, that we were traveling. I mean,

we'd been on this train, and now we were on -- and living in Japan was a lot of

fun, cause I was kind of a street kid, and learning Japanese very quickly. And then

being on this boat. And that took about, oh, three weeks to cross the Pacific. It

wasn’t a fast boat. And it was a lot of fun, I mean, I would go with my parents into

these very hot baths which the Japanese had, and then you’d get out of the bath and

have a cold bucket of ice water thrown on you. It was a lot of fun. I didn't feel I was

a refugee in that sense, no.

Indies. And they suffered terribly, many of them died, wi -- after the Japanese
invasion of what is now Indonesia. The ones, the [indecipherable] people, the
ones who could get visas to nowhere, when the war began about six months after
we left Japan, went to Shanghai and spent the war in Shanghai. None of them
stayed in Japan. And the Jewish community in Shanghai, I just know anecdotally,

A: Well, these are events that took place 65 years ago, so forgive me, but young
people are impressionable, and of course this was what, about six months or so, a
little less than six months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, so we saw it.
Seeing the Pacific fleet was very impressive, too. A-All those battleships and
aircraft carriers in one place. Probably not a good idea, but that was where they
were, and we -- I think we -- my father must have had some money, a little bit of
money, because he chartered a -- or hired a taxicab and we kind of took a trip

A: Oh well, there wasn’t an -- this was early in th -- relatively early in the war, and

Jews had left because of that, we had no idea of the Holocaust, per se, no. My

work. She was bringing food to Jews who were hiding and something like that,

to arrest or worse, and she was summarily shot. So she ended her life with a

who was a lawyer, as I said, was familiar with American immigration law, and we -
- and then -- st -- st -- Justice Department had every right to deport us. But under
U.S. law they could only deport us to the country that we had immediately entered
from, which was the empire of Japan. Or our native country, which was the
Poland that was under German occupation. So they said you had to leave, but there
was a catch 22 there in our favor. They couldn’t tell us where to go, cause there
was no place to go. And then, during the war, of course, th-there was -- as you
know, under the immigration law there was a Polish quota, and that Polish quota
for immigrants was subscribed until something like 1960, 20 years. But President
Roosevelt signed an executive order that basically said that unfilled slots, that is
people who were supposed to arrive say in 1942, but didn’t arrive because they
were trapped behind German lines, an -- those slots could be filled by people who
have -- who are otherwise of good character, never mind how they got here. And
on that basis, I think around 1943, while we were still in limbo as it were, we
emigrated to Canada and re-entered as le-legally with -- with these immigration
visas that were given to us in Canada. And then in 1948 we became USS. citizens,
five years later. I became a U.S. citizen, 1948.

gravitated to the newspaper business was that I was interested in the news as a
child. But I didn’t -- I -- I was not a fearful child, I was -- I was quite -- I mean, one
of the things that I would do as a child, since I was left alone a lot, would be to
throw matches out the window. And I was pretending that I was bombing. I mean, I
wa -- and because the matches would fall four stories and light on the concrete
below, and start little fires actually -- sometimes the fire department came -- in the
rubbish. And that was the way I amused myself.
Q: Because you had remembered planes coming over when you were young, or
why do you think you did that?
A: Well, I mean, we can get into the psychological and psyche -- psychiatric
aspects of this, but I-I -- who -- I played at war, and war was play, and it was not
fearful.
Q: Yeah. Did your parents re-react in front of you as the war kept going on and
news kept coming out about Jews in Europe, did they express that to you?
A: Not -- Gail, not to my recollection. I -- I had no recollection of the Holocaust
except after the war as a teenager by -- you know, I was 10 when the war ended, 11

about three years younger than I, who they left with the housekeeper, their
housekeeper and she survived the war in Warsaw. And then the housekeeper
wouldn’t release the -- Christina, who was brought up as a Christian, as Catholic.
And my father sent 5,000 dollars to Warsaw, which at that time, 1945, was a lot of
money. So somehow he got her to England. And she grew up in England. I met
her when I was 17 or so when I was in England, and then they moved eventually.

I’ve conversed with the Po-Pope in Polish, with no problem. So --
Q: So it sounds like you felt very American pretty soon on?
A: Yeah, yes. I mean, I labored at not being different, and that was my highest
priority. And --
Q: Did you know any other refugee children at that time?
A: I had a close friend, Robert Eisenthal, who was also in our class at P.S. 9, who

A: The only thing I do remember 1s -- and I was about 11, is -- at the -- that time
the New York Times had the war news on page two in official communiqués,
issued by -- e-every day there was a communiqué by each of the combatant
governments, including the Germans, and I re -- I -- I would read that. And so the
war was very, you know, important in that way, and remembered the wa -- the fact
that the windows in the school had masking tape on them in case we were bombed.
And so I remember asking my parents now that the war was over, I asked my
father, would newspapers still be published. That was a serious question because
the -- I thought of newspapers as being war news, I didn’t equate it with any other
kind of news, and I didn’t see any need for newspapers after the war. The
newspapers were to tell us about the war, and so no war, no newspapers.
Q: So you don’t remember any specific celebration that your parents had that the
war was over?
A: Well, th -- I have a very clear memory of my parents crying at -- at A-April 12",
I think it was, of 1945 when President Roosevelt died. Kind of -- that was the only
president we knew, and of course he, by signing that executive order, allowed us to
stay in the United States, which was becoming precarious. So that’s a clear
memory, Roosevelt’s death. And after that I just grew up.

Q: And then more and more came out about the Holocaust. How did you -- you or
your family react to tho -- that news?
A: Not really, I mean the -- the -- the thing that affected me most about the
Holocaust, frankly, was as an adult traveling to Israel, and particularly being with
Jimmy Carter at the Yad Vashem. And I don’t cry as an adult, but I did cry then,
and I was one of a few reporters, and I think Carter may have known my story, or
I may have said something to Jody Powell that -- without really going into it, why
it was -- it was -- I said -- I think I said 1t was important to me personally to be at
Yad Vashem with President Carter, and would it be okay. And so I’ve had these
adult experiences. Another one I had of a similar nature was in 1993 when I
happened to be in Warsaw with Vice President Gore 1-in which Gore and the
Israeli president at the time, made a speech a-at the memorial for the -- the Jews on
the 50" anniversary of the -- of the ghetto uprising, which was celebrated in
Warsaw, and I just happened to be in Warsaw at the time, not for this, but Al
Gore and so on, so I was with Gore. And a-as a Washington Bureau Chief for the
Cox newspapers. And so I remember being very much affected by that ceremony,
and crying. And -- and -- and just th-the thought that with -- with very few changes
in parameters, that I could have been in that ghetto. And, you know, going to the
Holocaust Museum and seeing children of my age walking in that large -- y-you

know what I mean, the -- the large kind of photograph, blown up photograph of the

ghetto with the trolley car coming through and everyone wearing the armbands and

so on. I-I could easily see myself being there and that -- I would end on the note

that it was really quite remarkable that I wasn’t there, and that we are having this

interview as I approach my 70" year.

Q: So you continued your schooling in New York. You -- you finished elementary

school and then what happened?

A: Joan of Arc Junior High School, Bronx High School of Science, Yale College,

and then a career in journalism followed -- a -- a short time in the army.

Q: And did you share -- as you were growing up in high school and in college and

so forth, did you share your background with other people? Did people know about

that?

A: No. No, the only place I shared it was on my passport, which said I was born in

Warsaw. But, no.

Q: Purposely, or you just didn’t think it was important?

A: It was just part of my li -- my father, when I was a young adult s-said to me, I

have just three requests of you. And one of them was, never f -- never go to

Germany. And the second one was, never buy a German car, although I think he

to marry outside the faith. Tho-Those are the three -- he said, otherwise you can do
anything you want in life. But guess which one of those requests I’ve honored in --
in life. None. But we got along fine.
Q: So you said you chose to go into journalism, and you thought maybe it related to
your experience as a child following the war news?
A: Well, just an exciting way of -- of -- as a high school student I worked at the
New York Herald Tribune delivering ads and picking up the weather map from
the weather bureau at the battery, and I earned enough money to travel, which I
often enjoyed. So I traveled through western Europe, didn’t go to eastern Europe
til qu-quite later. But I never thought of myself other than as an American, and the
experiences of the war was, I would say quite honestly that I [indecipherable]
thought about it until this interview, I suppose I repressed them. People have asked
me, why didn’t I write about it, and that’s a good question, I just didn’t. I mean, I
was a writer, and I -- I read stories in the New Yorker that have -- about similar
subjects that have -- might say less poignancy or even less relevance than my own
story, if it were told that way, as a personal history. But I -- I just didn’t do it. I
didn’t want to. And why, I’m not quite -- e-even to this day I’m not quite clear
why.

Beginning Tape Two, Side B
Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
volunteer collection interview with Andrew Glass. This is tape number two, side
B.
A: Well, what Ill say is that over the years I’ve gotten to know quite a few Polish
diplomats. I’ve interviewed the Polish president, I’ve interviewed the mayor of
Warsaw, prime ministers and so on, and spent time in Poland. Parenthetically, my
father and mother traveled a good deal. My father was an international
businessman, but he never returned to Poland, never returned to germa -- ne-never
returned to Germany. Traveled to Israel quite often, England, France, Italy.
Australia, of course, where were had family. An-an -- or they would meet in
Honolulu or Easter Island or somewhere. But I got -- as I said, I got to know quite
a few Poles over the years, including the Pope, and so my view of the Polish role
during World War II, quite honestly I would say, is a lot more nuanced and quite
different than my father’s -- what I regarded and still regard, I suppose, as a one-
dimensional view that all Poles are bad. So generational-ly we never agreed, but we
never talked about that.
Q: Becau -- you never talked about it because?
A: Well, because it was -- I mean, my father’s mind was made up on the subject

and there was no point in my saying look, there were also Poles who, unlike the
ones that you condemn -- I mean, he made a great point for the fact that Hitler felt
comfortable cre -- setting up death camps in Poland and to my knowledge, I guess,
Czechoslovakia, but th-that was -- th-the -- that he didn’t feel comfortable in
having say, death camps in France or Denmark or anywhere not on German soil
that wasn’t Poland. And so that -- that weighed heavily with my father, that
Auschwitz was in Poland and others, may -- five, six major death camps. And that,
you know, th-the numbers there are very stark. There was, at the time that the war
began -- I told you earlier [indecipherable] story of our flight, there were
3,100,000 Jews living in Poland. And while it’s not -- the numbers are not quite
precise, they range between 100,000 and 150,000 who survived out of that total,
who were in Poland when the war began. Some had left to go to Israel, some had
escaped earlier, but of the number that were there, I mean, you can do the math. It -
- it -- 1t -- it’s a very small -- and so, that has kind of created in my mind, Gail, a --
how to put it? A fact that I have a -- a -- a get out of jail free card. That e-every day
that I live, statistically I shouldn’t be alive. And so I-I would, over time, as a
journalist, I would find myself in some very dangerous places, like Detroit in the
middle of a huge race riot, which was more of a National Guard riot, but that’s
another story. Or in Afghanistan with the Soviet troops fighting the mujahideen.

Or in the first Gulf War with the scuds coming over, and everybody kind of
hiding, and I felt no fear. And I -- you know, the reaction was, you know, why --
why were these people kind of afraid that they’re going to die, bec -- and you
know, rationally there was a real risk that one of these mujahideen bullets that was
meant for the spiznars would hit me cause I was in the -- harm’s way in each of
these cases. But I felt kind of like who -- well, you know, I’m -- I’m living on
borrowed time anyway, so what? And so I’m sure that it wou -- it’s not going to
happen but if I was in Iraq today I would care less about my personal safety.
Q: Which feeds into a question I was going to ask you a little later, is, do you think
you’re a different kind of person than you would have been if you hadn’t
experienced the childhood that you had? Let’s say that you were born in the United
States and had a very relaxed early childhood. Is this because of what you did go
through that you had these feelings?
A: Well, it just -- as an a -- I suppose as an adult, the realization that I was a
survivor and that the chances of surviving statistically in my particular case, 2200
out of, I think 600,000 in Lithuania, almost all of whom died. I mean, the odds of
getting out were -- in the first instance out of Warsaw and in the second instance
out of Lithuania, third instance not being arrested in -- in the Soviet Union as -- as
o-obvious bourgeois, and the fourth instance leaving Japan just at the right time or

not, a-as many in that group of 2200 choosing to go to the Dutch East Indies, it
seemed like a good -- good idea at the time. I mean all -- or Shanghai -- all of
those were just, you know, five cushioned billiard shots, to arrive in San
Francisco, destitute financially, but -- but healthy and -- and ready to, you know,
start a new life. So I think honestly, that realization came to me only as a -- as an
adult, or at least as a teenager, not as a child.
Q: You finished college, and then did you say you went into the army, into the
service?
A: Yeah -- no, I finished college and I went into journalism and then I was drafted
and I served in the army, but never abroad. And then I went back to journalism and
eventually went to the New York Herald Tribune, which in 1962 sent me to
Washington as -- that time, I was also married and we’ve been -- been here since.
The Herald Tribune folded. I worked for awhile -- four years for the Washington
Post, and then I worked for -- on the hill for a couple of years for Senator Javits as
his press secretary and Senator Percy as his administrative assistant. I returned to
journalism in 1971 and worked four years for the “National Journal” as an editor -
- it’s still going. And then in 1974 I joined Cox newspapers, which founded a
bureau here and I worked from 1974 to 19 -- to 2001 for Cox newspapers, 21 of
those years as the chief of the Washington bureau. And had a year at Harvard as a

fellow and then worked, and still do, for The Hill newspapers as a writer and for a
while as the managing editor. And I’m looking for other things to write about, but
not the Holocaust.
Q: Y-You talked -- yo-you said you haven’t written, and you just said, and not. Can
you just elaborate a little bit more, why not?
A: Well, I -- I don’t know. I mean, I -- obviously I should. I wrote -- I think I wrote
one column about ca -- 1t was a column about immigration policy in California and
how illegal aliens were being treated badly. And I told a little bit of my story, not a
lot, but I mainly concentrated on my mother -- excuse me, on my mother-in-law,
who was also an illegal -- is -- I mean, I made the point that we were illegal aliens
and that my father-in-law and mother-in-law were illegal. And she returned to her
native Italy after the war -- which was devastated. They were -- the family was
from an area just south of Naples called Terra Del Greco, just in the shadow of
Mount Vesuvius near Pompeii and so she came back and then she wanted to
return after about six months and her papers, as they say, were not in order. And
they wouldn’t let her on the -- on the ship and so I think my sister’s brothers went
to see a congressman who was the head of the State Department committee that
arranged for the State Department to get money. He was State Justice Commerce
Appropriations Chair John J. Rooney. And they pointed out to Rooney that

nobody asked about the citizenship when two of my wife’s brothers were killed in
World War II, and so why were they raising these questions now? And so Rooney
made a -- a call to the State Department and -- or passed a private bill, or -- no, I
think he just made a call to the State Department, she was on the next boat back
from Naples. And I told that story in a column that I wrote about, and that made an
impression on me that, you know, here were two relatively successful -- a Harvard
educated psychiatrist and a Washington Bureau Chief who were, you know, from
illegal aliens, so give me a break. So that was -- but that was a 600 word column,
so that [indecipherable] ma-made an impact, on me anyway.
Q: You said you have a son, did you -- when he was very, very young, up -- even a
toddler, did that bring back memories of what you had to go through when you
were his age?
A: No, but one story, my am -- as I said, my -- my grandfather’s house, there was a
housekeeper who, when this house -- mansion really, was taken over by the bil-
billeted Germans, she was of course, thrown out. And she managed to save a
cottage cup -- two, I think. And so after the war -- a-a -- and a lot of this -- this --
this cottage cup was from mid-18" century, and quite valuable, but more valuable
as Silver, just to melt it down. And a lot of this stuff was melted down because

course; after the war they sent her money. And so when I went to Warsaw he
asked me to look her up, she was 1n her mid-90’s by that time. And she insisted that
I take these cottage cups back with me, one of which I gave to my father. I don’t
know what happened to it, I don’t have it, maybe my mother has it. And one I kept
myself. And my son, who was a toddler -- a little older than a toddler, but about the
same age that I was when I arrived here, said Daddy, when you die, can I have this
cup? And that was a profoundly imp -- imp -- it impressed me. It impressed me.
And of course his mother was Catholic and I was Jewish and we had to decide
whether we’re going to rear him as a Catholic or as a Jew, or none of the above,
and so we reared him as a Jew, and so he is a Jew.
Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Has he been to Poland at all? Have you taken him and shown
him Warsaw?
A: No, I don’t think -- he’s been to Prague, he’s been to Berlin a couple of times,
he’s going to Berlin next week. But he’s never been to Warsaw. I’d like him to go.
Q: Do you consider yourself a Zionist?
A: No, no, I consider myself an American. I have no Zionist feelings. And I’ve
been to Israel quite a bit, but only as a journalist, not as a Zionist. Not recently, but
a lot during the time of the -- the war and the -- and I’ve gotten to know many
Israelis, I mean, we lived literally behind the Israeli ambassador’s house, which

didn’t used to have a fence when the ambassador was Yitzhak Rabin. So we got to
know Rabin, largely because my dog would often -- our little puppy then, would
often end up in Rabin’s backyard, so we would have to retrieve him and I got to
know Rabin that way, but also professionally wrote about him, and visited with
him when I went to Israel.
Q: When you -- when you are in Israel, do you feel any connection to the country?
A: No, I mean, no -- none -- no, no, no --
Q: Or is it just another foreign country?
A: Well, it’s a special place. I feel more at home there than say in Saudi Arabia,
but that’s because it’s a western democracy that has McDonald’s and -- and
parliament, the Knesset and so on. Not because I’m Jewish or anything like that.
But I’ve had close friends who made aliyah and who lived in Israel and I visited
them when I was in Israel for other pur -- not pa-particularly to see them, but while

Israel, so --

Q: Do you feel Polish in any way?

Polish embassy, they invite me and sometimes I go. And I’ve been to the
ambassador’s home -- he lives in the neighborhood -- for lunch and dinner and that
kind of thing. And I -- I-I -- I -- when I was president of the Gridiron Club and sat
next to President Bush -- this was in 2001 -- you get to invite, you know, whoever
you want, and I just kind of, you know, on a lark I invited the Polish ambassador to
the dinner, he had never been to a Gridiron dinner, didn’t know what it was. And I -

president, they wanted a president with some polish. And Bush was very gracious,
he said that he -- he had been president then for just about three months and he told

was to set up a -- a bureau in and within the bureau of [speaks Polish here] which
means election newspaper in Polish. And so we had a correspondent there because
Cox had invested in -- in that newspaper after the fall of communism, helped them
out. It was -- turned out to be a very good investment, we’re de-investing it now,
but made a lot of money. Anyway, I had something to do with that. So we -- we

set up and exchange news, so I gave that news to the Gazetta correspondent who
was working in the Cox bureau, and so they had a big exclusive that Bush was
coming to Poland on a -- on -- on -- on good authority. I couldn’t -- couldn’t give
them my source, but I said, you can take it to the bank, I know it’s true. The guy I
talked to knows what he’s talking about. And so I’ve had lunch with the Polish
ambassador and so on, and we talk in Polish or in English, it’s -- and it’s -- and I’m
comfortable with that.
Q: And are you comfortable when you’re in Poland walking on the streets of
[indecipherable]
A: Well, it’s interesting, because you know, I’m identified as an American and I’ve
-- most of the trips I’ve taken to Poland would have been with -- with the first
President Bush, or with President Clinton, or with Jimmy Carter and I would just
be a member of the White House press corps, and they would make comments and

believing that what they were saying wa -- and I -- you know, I would say nothing,
but then when I would leave, I would make a tart remark in Polish and their jaws
would drop. So that was fun, you know, to be a kind of a hidden Pole --
Q: Uh-huh.
A: -- as amember of the White House press corps.
Q: Yeah.
A: But other than that, no.
Q: What are your feelings when you’re in Germany”
A: Normal. It’s the largest country in Europe and I’ve been going to Germany -- |
star -- I guess I started going when we -- the economic summits started, which was
in the late 70’s, and they would -- as you know, they would rotate and one would
be in Bonn every seven years, so I would go to Bonn for that. And then I would go
with Carter to Berlin and I think I went with President Ford to Germany, I don’t
remember that, but I’ve been there quite a bit. And recently on holiday with my
wife, who just loved Berlin. And my son 1s going to Berlin next week. He’s an
MBA at Columbia and the class is going to Germany on some business trip. And
he wa -- also had a scholarship to Heidelberg and learned German at Yale, so -- all
of that was after my father died.
Q: Mm-hm.

A: But, speaks really fluent German.
Q: Do you think there are any lessons to be learned from what you experienced,
what your family experienced?
A: Well, there’s got to be existential lesson of -- of how life is precious and how --
without getting too deep about it, how the road taken and the road not taken can
make a very big difference in life. And -- and the randomness of who survives and
who doesn’t survive, co-coupled with the low odds of survival have made an
impression on me, but not as a child, or even as a -- as a teenager, but more as an
adult, and particularly late in life, which would lead to things like an interest in
doing this interview.
Q: Why bef -- in -- in the years past, did you not feel the need, or did -- o-or why is
it now that you feel more? Because of the stage of life we’re in?
A: I don’t know, I mean I -- I’ve just taken it in, the Holocaust Museum. We
became friends with a couple that had a -- a lot to do -- a Baltimore couple that had
a lot to do with setting up the museum and they became close friends of ours. And
then I-I was on the convention plat -- convention arrangements committee for the
American Society of Newspaper Editors and I arranged for the editors to have a
separate and -- tour of the museum when the museum first opened, and of -- also
for Ted Koppel to lead in a very interesting discussion at the museum about

Holocaust denial by the American press during World War II, and particularly the
role of the New York Times. So I had a -- you know, I’ve had a -- a -- a role -- a
role that -- that way.

Q: Y-You’re talking about now, for instance, the New York Times not giving as
much space in the paper to what was happening. Does that make you angry”?

A: No, but it’s been well documented and they -- they didn’t want to be -- a -- a-- a
friend of mine, Alex Jones wrote a book about history of the New York Times,
and he was the creator -- cur -- cur -- curator of a program at Harvard that I
participated in, the Kennedy School of Politics as a fellow, and of course he has a
lot in there about the Times not wanting to identify itself as a Jewish newspaper
during World War I, and so that was --

Q: That -- does that elicit any emotional feeling in -- in you?

A: Truthfully no, no. Just -- one of the things, Gail, as you become a journalist, at
least in my generation of journalists is that you -- you -- you -- y-you step out of
your skin a lot. You feel that you’re a somewhat classless person and that the very
rich and the very important bear no special role in your life to the homeless person,
they have equal balance. And I feel that very strongly, I always have. And I -- 1-1-in
the sense that as a leader, a bureau chief and so on, I’ve tried to inculcate leading
by example, that you, in the younger generation of journalists, not to be in awe of --

of the rich and powerful and not to be -- look down at anyone who is in trouble or
in -- in jail or in -- in modest circumstances, treat them all the same, the same. And
perhaps in my own background, you know, that growing up poor, but with a rich
mentality if you will. That may have had something to do with why I became a
journalist, I don’t know. It’s too deep for me.
Q: When you go into the Holocaust Museum here in Washington, does it give you
any sp -- di-different feelings?
A: Well, as I said, particularly the view of the Warsaw ghetto and the br -- the role
of that. I’ve recently visited the -- not a Holocaust museum, but a German -- a
museum recently o -- that opened in -- in Berlin that traces the story of Jews in
Germany, and I felt no particular -- I didn’t have that feeling. But I’ve been to
Warsaw and talked to people who are trying to create a Holocaust museum against
some odds in -- in Warsaw, and so I tried to help them with the -- the sense of
giving them some -- some support.
Q: Did you have any connection with Professor Jan Karski when he was living in
Washington and teaching at Georgetown?
A: Yes, I knew him and I talked to him. I met him at the embassy, I had several
meals with him. I met him also in Warsaw when he was back there, not that long
ago, shortly before he died. I knew him. He was a very important figure, yup.

Q: Did you feel a Polish connection to him, being born in Poland yourself?
A: Well, I feel a connection to Poles and -- and I’m Polish, I mean that -- it says in
Who’s Who in America, born in Warsaw, so that won’t go away. Maybe the
listing in Who’s Who will end, but being born in Warsaw, well, that stays.
Q: Well, as you say, is there anything we haven’t talked about that you wanted to
say on the tape?
A: What I wanted to say Gail is that I’ve been interviewed in different
circumstances on -- and I m-mainly been on the other side of that microphone, and
I don’t recall a more thorough, professional interview than the one that you have
just concluded.
