We spent about, I would say, five days in Dachau before the two recruiting officers from Siemens found us again. We were again singled out. This time we were transported by truck, military convoy to Berlin; Siemens, their main factory there. That\u2019s where we continues doing our little thing. Except that every time the Allies laid down one of those bomb carpet, we had to go into the bunkers, into the shelters. This was in Arbeitslager. This was not a concentration camp, this was a work camp. At that time we had to go hurriedly back to the work camp and go into the bunker because Siemens had in itself, only bunkers enough for their own employees. So we had to go back. We had to share these bunkers with the SS. But again, they left us alone. They were humans, human beings. They left us alone. There was one bunker next to ours; there was only SS. We didn\u2019t - they didn\u2019t --. One of those bombs really hit hard. I was standing near the door and I felt the impact from the air rushing in, you know, the pressure, the sudden air pressure. The bunker next to us got a direct hit and when they dug these -- got all these bodies out, one guy had a gun, the thing was turned around and looked like a trumpet, one of those French horns. That was the impact."

Most people saw the light; that this was an untenable situation and the Germans were done for. Was only a matter of time. They prepared us -- again no hardships. They prepared us for a march to Meklenburg, to the Meklenburg region and we were supposed to board a Red Cross ship in Bremen but we had to walk over there.

We had our -- at that time our hair was starting to grow and we had our -- we took our blankets along and all that. We were pretty well organized there. In the morning, we looked around, no SS. No German officers. There was a clearing. In a far clearing, I saw a rider, man on horseback. Turned out to be a Russian soldier on reconnaissance. They discovered us and took us in to a gigantic farmhouse with a barnyard and what-not. The Russian colonel who turned out to be a medical doctor, spoke a good German at that time, he said, look, you\u2019re free.

They fed us pretty well. They gave us no solid food for the first two days and then they started out with a slice of bread here, a little there and so on. But somehow I reacted, I came down with dysentery. Then the Russian said, we have no ill facilities. Pll tell you what, we\u2019ll deliver you to the British. They have a field lab, a field infirmary and they can get you back, straightened out. They put me on a -- what the Russians call an ambulance, and got me over to the British lines which weren\u2019t far away. There, I spent about three weeks on a diet of all horsemeat hamburgers.

The books were gone, of course. I lived there for a year before I came down with the -- the diagnosis was water on the lungs. I went to the hospital and they found that I had water, I don\u2019t know. They took one of those gigantic syringes, those horse syringes, big needle, heavy gauge needle. The doctor felt me between the ribs and just jabbed that thing into the lungs and pulled out water. Pulled the water out of my lungs. Thank God the water was clear so there was no evidence of tuberculosis. They put me in a ward together with tubercular patients. So in order to prevent me from catching tuberculosis, they inject me with an aspirin solution. A sugar solution of aspirin, 500 milligrams a day, three times a day. They reduced it to 200, twice a day and then I came out of it, no evidence of tuberculosis. Well, here I am."
