GUIDO CALABRESI
July 27, 2017
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Judge Guido Calabresi, on July 27", 2017, in New Haven, Connecticut. Thank
you very, very much Judge Calabresi, for agreeing to meet with us today, and to
share your story, and to let us have a little window into the experiences that you
and your family had during those terrible and turbulent years of World War II, and
pre-World War II. PIl start with the most basic questions, and the very first one is,
can you tell me the date of your birth?
Answer: I was born in October 18, 1932.
Q: And where were you born?
A: I was born in Milan. I was born in an apartment my parents — my father had just
gone there to teach. We soon after moved to a house with my family owned in
Milan, on Via Canova. And such is the world — Via Canova is in the center, near
the castle and so on — such 1s the world that now that house, which was our house,
is the Turkish consulate.
Q: No kidding. Well that — that leads me to a question that usually would be way
towards the end of the interview, but I'll ask 1t now so I don’t forget. If 1t was your
house, and you left it, was it that it was confiscated from you, or you so — your
family sold it?

Interview with Guido Calabresi i
July 27, 2017
A: No, no, we sold it after the war, it was damaged, we sold it for almost nothing. It
was damaged because some bombs had hit nearby. How we managed, somehow, to
keep properties is — is part of the story —
Q: Yeah.
A: — that is — yeah.
Q: Yeah. Okay. And then another question that seems self-evident, but it’s part of
our format is, can you tell me, what was your name at birth?
A: My name was Guido Calabresi, no —
Q: As it is today.
A: As it is today.
Q: Okay, no changes.
A: No changes.
Q: Tell me a little bit about both your mother and your father, starting with their
names.
A: My mother’s name was Bianca Maria Finzi-Contini, and married to
Calabresi. She was born actually in Milan, because her father, who was a — an
early neurologist, he studied with Charcot, the teacher of Freud. About the same
time, he decided that much of it was bunk, he inherited some money, and kept up.
He said, someday it will all be fine. That’s kind of nice, because his great-

grandchildren, one my gran — my daughter, is a psychiatrist. My brother’s son is a
neurologist professor at Johns Hopkins. So it’s come round.
Q: Yeah.
A: But he was in Milan at the time. But they were from Bologna.
Q: Okay.
A: And Finzi-Contini originally all came from Ferrara, but the family had
transferred to Bologna quite early and — and was a family that was responsible for
much of the urban development of Bologna. They owned a good deal of the center
of Bologna.
Q: Wow.
A: The kind of key figure in all this was a man named Leon Vita Finzi-Contini,
who was born in 1776, and who — whose grave is in the Jewish cemetery in
Bologna. He had many children by his first wife, who went in all different
directions. Some are very actively practicing Jews in Israel. One is a— was a
relative in some other way, is a good friend, is a professor of economics in — in — in
Turin. And some married Catholic nobles, and became immensely rich. One of the
great art collections in Italy is the Contini Bonacossi Collection in Florence, and
they are all descendants. They didn’t always behave well, so it — the family, they —

July 27, 2017
Q: In what way’?
A: They — they had dealings with the — with the Nazis, and so on, and so the family
sort of ignored them. But that was — he then married a second wife, and we descend
from his second wife, and — and — but part of that 1s the reason why the name
Finzi-Contini is one that gets used.
Q: Well, that was — I mean, of course, that’s one of the questions that I was going
to ask later, but I’ll ask it now, is — 1s of course the movie, that was ever —
A: Yeah.
Q: — you know, so very popular, “The Garden of the Finzi-Continis.”
A: So let me first say something about my father.
Q: Yes.
A: Well, one other thing about my mother’s family. Her mother is of a family that
claims to have been brought by Titus in his triumph, in 70 Common Era. Caesar
Roff(ph) says it’s so. The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1900 says it’s so. There were —
when the Romans conquered a place, they tended to bring princes, kings and so on
in their trials. When the conquered Palestine, they brought judges, priests and
elders. We were the elders. Zekanym(ph).
Q: PIl tell you, I have — I’m sorry to interrupt. I have never met somebody who
could trace his family back —

July 27, 2017
A: Well —
Q: — more than 200 years.
A: Yeah.
Q: Never mind 2,000.
A: Well, so they came as, in the tribe — I— I must say, I haven’t seen anybody — I
went to the Arch of Titus, nobody looks like my great-uncle, carrying the menorah,
but there it is. Anyway, they came as — as slaves, originally, became tutors to the
emperors. Followed the emperors to Ravenna when the western empire went there,
and when the empire fell, around 500, moved nearby, to a town of Lugo, where
they set up shop as bankers, moneylenders, and as rabbis of the Italian rite. Because
we are Italkim; we are not Sephardic, we are not Ashkenazim, we are people who
were there before the diaspora, and in Italy, and in Israel — there’s a synagogue in
Israel which is the Italian one. Obvious rite. And that was what our tradition was
on both sides. And so these people, who had all sorts of ups and downs, ultimately
lent enough money to the pope so that he gave them permission to practice their
trade in Bologna. And I think the popes meant by trade, banking, money-lending.
These people said, but we are teachers of law, because they were rabbis of the
Italian rite. And so, I don’t know if it’s true, but somehow — but the — the legend 1s
that the way we got into law teaching was because of this. Anyway, so —

July 27, 2017
Q: How did you learn of this?
A: Oh, this is all family tales and stories that ha — have been, and I just enjoy them.
Well, anyway, that line is one which was very self-important, for obvious reasons.
Q: Yeah.
A: And my grandmother married my grandfather, this — of this very good family,
with high intellectual traditions, and so on, and going back hundreds of years in
itself, in Ferrara. But that gave that name a certain connotation, of elegance, or
something. My — I said to my mother — my mother said aristocracy, I said
decadence, she said it’s the same thing, Guido. And there it is. Okay. Now.
Q: A child would say that to his mother.
A: Let me then take my father’s family, and — because that deals with this book.
My father’s family, the Calabresi, were, according to their tradition, which isn’t as
proven as the other, were traders in Rome in Republican time. That is even earlier.
Now, it is a fact that the largest number of people in Rome who were not Romans,
at the time of the Roman Republic, before Julius Caesar, before the empire and so
on, were Jews, who were traders. There were about 15 — 2500. Different figures,
but a significant number of people who were Jews trading. And the story, in that
side of the family is that they stayed there, and when — and settled somewhere
south of Rome, where we don’t know. In 1496, everything from Rome south was

Spanish territory, and Jews were expelled in 1492 from Spain, 1496 from Spanish
territory, Portugal and Spanish territory. Two people went from somewhere south
of Rome, to Ferrara. And there is a document which says two people came from
Le Calabria. Today Calabria is just the toe. But in Ferrara, at the time, they
called everything from Rome south, Le Calabria. And said where two people
came, bought lands — because Ferrara was very open to Jews. I’ll show you some
pictures [indecipherable]. And because they came from Le Calabria and there
were two of them, we called them Calabrese, which means people from Calabria.
Calabrese with an e, meaning person, is quite a common name in the south.
Calabresi with an iis unusual. It isn’t always just descendants of these two, but a
lot are descendants of these two, and with an i, it often is Jewish. With and e — not
always, but often is — with an e, almost never.
Q: Never.
A: We — the other line had many children, and so on. We were down to none, until
my father was born. He was the only male of his generation. So my grandfather
tried to see if these two were related. Then my father was born, and he lost interest.
Anyway, they came to Ferrara, joined the Italian synagogue. There were in
Ferrara a German, a Spanish, and an Italian, and they joined the Italian. But it
wasn’t because they were angry with the Spanish. If you look at the ruins of the

July 27, 2017
Spanish synagogue, you see signs of donations by Calabresi because they treated
us so well, when we were in their territory. So it — they were Italkim, who had to be
Sephardic when this was Spanish territory, got to Ferrara, found an Italian
synagogue and joined up in it, which gives some evidence that maybe the story that
they went back, is true. They married into another very, very old and very wealthy
family of Ferrara, Minerbi, who are also — again, the family is all over. One of
them, Sergio Minerbi is in Israel and was the ambassador of Israel to the unite —
to Europe, and — and at one point to the Vatican, which he didn’t much like. But he
— anyway, this family is a major, major family, and had — and members of the
family still do — had houses — and I’Il show you on the map of Ferrara afterwards,
where — which go back to the 13" century. My father’s first cousin and best friend,
was the patron of Bassani, the man who wrote the book from which the movie was
taken. He helped him financially, and Bassani wrote the book, that book and
others. He dedicated one to my cousin, but he wrote that book and others in that
family house, in the library of that house. And he —
Q: Minerbi? In the Minerbi family house?
A: In the Minerbi family house. And he told my father’s cousin in the courtyards
of this house, I’m writing a book, and I’m going to call it, “The Garden of the
Finzi-Contini.” Why did he pick my mother’s name —

July 27, 2017
Q: Yeah.
A: —1n my father’s family’s house? Nobody knows this, but I do.
Q: Tell me.
A: And the story, I’m sure, is this. His patron’s younger sister, my mother’s — my
father’s first cousin —
Q: And his father’s first cousin’s name was?
A: Giuseppe Minerbi, Beppe Minerbi. And as I say, he dedicated another book,
‘The Heron,” to him, and there are any number of things about it. Beppe had a
younger sister, who married my mother’s brother. They met at our — my parents’
wedding, married. So that it was not surprising that he would think, in this guy’s
house, of a younger — near his age, not his age, person named Finzi-Contini. And
then, the fact that Finzi-Contini connoted all sorts of things, pleased him. Now —
Q: Did he have to get permission?
A: — the story — well, there’s the — the story is — bu — the story in the movie and so
on, isn’t about us. I can tell you almost everything that happened, whom it
happened to. And some happened to one, some happened to another, and — and so
on. But it wasn’t our story, with one possible, interesting exception. But certainly
not the Finzi-Contini. Did he have to get permission? We thought that he had not,

July 27, 2017
and my mother was kind of annoyed at that. In the papers of my double cousin, that
is this son of my mother’s brother and my father’s cousin —
Q: Minerbi —
A: — who died a couple of years ago.
Q: Okay.
A: And who was my age, and very close. We found a letter that he had not
particularly seen, because he — he never talked about — and he would have, we’ve
talked about the thing, to his father, my uncle.
Q: From Barani(ph)?
A: From Bassani.
Q: Bassani, excuse me.
A: Saying, I’m writing a book, and I want to call it “The Garden of the Finzi-
Contini.” I thought of you because of that. So that I am quite sure of the story —
nobody knows this, but 1t’s so — and I’m — that he sort of asked for permission. And
that’s how that came to.
Q: Did your mother fa — did you find tha — were you able to tell your mother this?
A: No, my mother was long since dead.
Q: It went pa — okay.
A: I just learned this two years ago, when my cousin died.

Q: Okay.
A: My mother made peace with Bassani. It was an intere — that’s another story,
that is really to decide, but —
Q: Well, let’s come — I mean, I do want to discuss the —
A: Yeah.
Q: — “The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,” as a movie, as a work of art, as
something that is —
A: And as — also as — yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: Because where it — there are interesting questions about that. Bassani himself
didn’t like the movie for certain reasons.
Q: Oh, did he? Okay.
A: No. He pulled himself away, and then it’s a reason, all which have to do with
the treatment of Jews during that time, and so on. So —
Q: So let’s — I'd like to talk about that, but let’s leave that for later, so that we make
a distinction between what is truly your family’s story —
A: That’s right.
Q: — and then —

Q: — you know, the — the taking of that story —
A: Yeah, it —
Q: — and sometimes twisting or changing.
A: That’s right. Yeah.
Q: Iam —I must say, I am awed to learn of such a history, that goes back so many
centuries, and that it would be known. I mean, there are many things that come to
my mind as you’re telling. Number one, that there would be enough factual
knowledge to be able to support some of the stories that you hear.
A: Yes.
Q: I mean, that is unusual in itself
A: Yes.
Q: And number two, that there is no assimilation. And yet —
A: No, there’s no —
Q: No assimilation. We have two millennia.
A: Well, that is interesting too, because at — at any number of times, in the history
of this Zekanym(ph), Delvecchio(ph), DeLugo(ph) family, you have first names
that sound Catholic. And at other times you have names that are nondescript, like
Alexander, Cyrus, names that Jews who were assimilating had. And at other times
you have names which are clearly Jewish, Ekakoh(ph), Solomone(ph),

Abramo(ph), and so on. So that I think — and I think it is clearly the case, that at
many times, in the history of these families, some married Catholics, some
assimilated, some came back. At times it was done because it was useful. At times
it was done because people did. But then, there always was a pull back. And that’s
kind of interesting, because no — my — it’s another story, but my mother became
Catholic, and I was brought up Catholic. My wife is an old Yankee. My daughter,
Bianca Finzi-Contini reconverted.
Q: To Judaism?
A: What?
Q: To Judaism?
A: Yeah. And her daughter, Ginevra(ph) Finzi-Contini Gilmore is going to have
her Bat Mitzvah this coming June. So — and the same is true of some branches in
Italy. It’s just a very complicated tale.
Q: It is. It is, and it is very different from — from both the history of Jews in other
countries, and their lives —
A: Yes, yes.
Q: — in these other countries, and their identities in these other countries.
A: Yes.
Q: Because as a —

that’s another — yeah.

A: We’re fine, no.
Q: Okay, we have a bit of time.
A: They’re going to tell us.
Q: Okay. So tell me a little bit about this, about — well, let’s start with some factual
things. Your mother, did she have siblings?
A: She had three siblings. She was the eldest.
Q: Okay, Bianca.
A: Then her — the second, Bruna(ph) Finzi-Contini was the one who married the
Minerbi.
Q: Okay.
A: The third, Marcella(ph), married a man named Guido Tedeschi, who was of a
very, very wealthy old, very Jewish family of Bologna.
Q: Okay.
A: And their story, they ended up going to Brazil, and their story is another
interesting story, why they went to Brazil, and it’s part of our story of coming. And
then a younger brother, Renato(ph), who married a woman of a Sephardic family,

but who also was in some other way a cousin, because there were many inter-
cousins marriage. And their son 1s still alive, and lives in Milan, and is a very close
friend.
Q: Okay, so to it — so there was bianc — yeah.
A: And my father’s family, instead, were free. My father was the youngest, he had
an older sister Renata, who was one of the founders of clinical psychology. She
fled to America —
Q: Okay.
A: — too. Then Cecilia(ph), who — neither were married. She stayed in Italy, and
looked after my grandmother, and did some quite courageous and remarkable
things during the war.
Q: Okay.
A: And after the war, she came and joined us, but both are buried in the Jewish
cemetery in Ferrara.
Q: And your father’s name is?
A: Massimo.
Q: Massimo. So, he was the youngest of three.
A: Yeah.
Q: And he had two elder sisters.

July 27, 2017
A: Yes.
Q: Okay. And your mother ha — was the oldest of four.
A: Four.
Q: And how —
A: She had two younger brothers and one younger sister.
Q: Sister, okay. Why is it that your mother eith — was it herself, or her parents who
converted to Catholicism?
A: She converted. That’s actually a very interesting story. She converted, and my
father, who did not, and who is interesting, because I don’t think practically ever
set foot in a synagogue. He was a not a believer in any way, though he wanted, and
we'll talk about that, to be buried in the Jewish cemetery in Ferrara, and he — it’s a
complicated business. But he would, I think, have been extremely upset if my
mother had done what many, many people in her family, and in all sorts of other
families did, was to convert because of the racial laws. Because he would have
thought — he thought that was cowardly. Or, done for financial reasons, which it
was done. I’m not one to judge; many people did that, and so on. My mother
converted, I’m quite sure, for a very odd reason. She was a highly intellectual
woman, PhD in Italy, PhD here. In some ways, a feminist. And not in a modern
way, but a woman who — and at some point, she decided she believed in God. And

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection

July 27, 2017
the problem was that all these ancient Italian Jewish families, pretty much all of
them, were non-practicing, non-believers. I mean, you know, we were Jewish
because that was the great tradition. It was almost a snobbery. It was something we
were very, very keen on, and are still very, very keen on. But it was not a religious
matter, at all. But people in Italy who were religious, were all Orthodox. Now, for
a woman who thought herself liberated, to be Orthodox at that time — we’re talking
1920s and so on, 30s, that didn’t fit. And so —
Q: She didn’t have choices.
A: — it’s a little ironical today.
Q: Yeah.
A: She became Catholic because this was a way to practice, because she didn’t feel
you could just be religious, and not.
Q: And not associated with something.
A: That’s right. And — and my father respected that in a way that he would not have
respected — he didn’t like it.
Q: Yeah.
A: But he respected it. And the interesting thing about her, as she became older and
older, she said, as I get older, I become ever more Catholic, and ever more Jewish.
Q: Well —

A: Yeah.
Q: — you know? In the end of the day, this is the foundation of western civilization.
A: That’s right. And it’s — it’s sort of interesting to me, that feeling. Now, as I say,
now, she had a — a Catholic grandmother whom she never knew. That is her father,
Finzi-Contini’s mother was a noble Catholic who died in childbirth with my
grandfather. My great-grandfather remarried somebody who was Jewish and my
grandfather was brought up in this —
Q: The Jewish —
A: — well, Jewish without any practicing, but very conscious of his Jewish. So that
va — va — there was this — this Catholic, but the — that was not unusual, for the
reasons I said. There were always intermarriages, and things.
Q: You know, it is so — there are ironies that are abounding, because there’s — there
is some assimilation, there is intermarriage, and yet there’s still a distinct identity —
A: That’s right.
Q: — that goes on for centuries.
A: That’s exactly.

the name, it wasn’t the book or the thing then, but the name Finzi 1s a classic
Italian Jewish name. So that anybody who knows anybody sees Finzi, says Jewish.

which is the English of it. I almost never — when I was in high school, I sometimes
used the name Guy, which is the English for Guido, but basically I never used it.
My brother — again, it had more to do with what happened when we first came. In
that sense became more — slightly more conformist, and he was known as Paul. He
became chief of medicine at Brown, and was one of the fen — founders of cancer
chemotherapy.

sabbatical for the first time. And we lived what seemed to be a very ordinary life.
Underneath, there was a tremendous struggle, because my father, from the earliest
days of fascism, had been an active anti-fascist. He was first beaten and jailed in
1924, when he was a student in Florence.
Q: Studying what?
A: They were in Florence because my grandparents had moved from Ferrara to
Florence. They had moved from Ferrara to Florence because my grandfather
Calabresi, who was an industrialist, was a very powerful man. His wife, Minerbi,
was a — probably the wealthiest family in Ferrara, certainly the wealthiest Jewish
family in Ferrara, of great landowners. They owned huge amounts of land. To the
fascists, in a small town like Ferrara, having this pair, who were fiercely anti-
fascist, was too dangerous. And so they said, out of here. You can go anywhere in
Italy you want, but not in Ferrara. And if you come back to Ferrara, we'll jail
you. So my par — grandparents, moved to Florence. And there is, my oral historian
found a letter from the fascist prefect in Ferrara, to the fascist prefect in Florence,
you’ve gotten yourself a real headache, because Ettare(ph) Calabresi — my
erandfather’s name — likes to talk, causes trouble, has re — millions to support his
trouble, and he is going to cause you — my grandfather went away. My father
became actively anti-fascist, and part of a small group of democrats with a small d,

who were anti-fascist. They didn’t belong to any ism. He helped distribute the first
underground newspaper, non mollare, don’t give up. Was called justice and
liberty, “Giustizia e liberta.” And on his grave it says, in Italian, faithful to justice
and liberty, which is a pun, both — he was, as I say, va — was very, very active.
When it c-came clear that Mussolini wouldn’t fall, that they couldn’t bring him
down, in the late 20s, early 30s, my father wanted to leave.
Q: Italy”
A: Yeah. My grandfather was a patriot of the old school, and said, one doesn’t
leave one’s country, one stays and fights. And so we stayed. In the fall of 1937, my
grandfather died of natural causes. That same summer, slightly before, the two
brothers who had become heads of this small group of anti-fascists — they were
named Rosselli, and everywhere in Italy you’ll find a square or a boulevard named
Fratelli Rosselli, Roselli brothers, were murdered by the fascists. So my f — and
they were my father’s closest friends. And my aunt, the one who came, were just
very close friends. So my father said, it’s getting too close, and with his father
dying, he didn’t feel an obligation to stay. So in 1937, before the racial laws, my
father decided that we would leave. But that was not easy, because you couldn’t
leave.
Q: Let’s get to that in a minute. You say he was beaten up in the early 20s.

A: Yes.
Q: Do you know the circumstances of that?
A: Oh, I know the circumstances very well. I’ve told it in some commencement
talks. One of my commencement talks at Connecticut College, many years ago, 1s
listed in the best — 10 best commencement talks, as published somewhere, because
it was choices.
Q: Yeah.
A: And one of the stories is how my father chose to become an active anti-fascist.
And I asked him, and he said, everybody talks about the banality of evil, no one
talks about the banality of good, and it is equally — well, here’s how it happened. I
was a student at the University of Florence, because we had moved to Florence,
and the fascists had kicked out the president of the university because he was very
strong and tough, and —

a nice man, we liked. And wasn’t particularly fascist, but was weak. So but — ah, he
was installed, and he was our teacher, so we went to the installation. And he gave a
speech, and fine, and we applauded. And then the fascist minister of education got
up, and gave a horrible speech. Well, him just saying, you’ll do this, you’ll do that,
you'll do the other, just horrible. You can imagine. And he stopped in the middle,
as politicians will do for applause, and my father said, I didn’t applaud. And said
some — couple of us didn’t applaud. We didn’t hiss or boo. We were much too well
brought up to do anything like that. But we just didn’t applaud. Then somebody
behind me said, the next time he stops, you’d better applaud, because there are
some goons at the back who are taking the names of those who are not applauding.
My father said, I was 21 years old. If somebody had told me that if I went and
didn’t applaud I’d get into trouble, I probably would have stayed home. Or I might
even have gone and applauded. But here I didn’t applaud, and now somebody told
me I had to applaud. I couldn’t do it. So I didn’t applaud the next time, and when
we left, we got picked up and beaten up. And I said, what happened then? He said,
we went to wash. And I said, why? He said, we didn’t want to go home, people
lived at home, and they [indecipherable] the university, and show ourselves
bloody, to scare our — our parents would have been frightened. And I said, where
did you wash? Well, there was a fountain right there, and so we washed there. And

so I said, did you wash there to show you had been beaten up? And he said, I don’t
think so, no. He became a little bit — but we washed there, and the fascists thought
that we did, and so they picked us up again and beat us up again and tossed us into
jail. And so, at that point, I was an active anti-fascist. I mean, that was it. And he
then did other things. On the anniversary, he and my aunts — and this been written
up recently — on the anniversary of the murder of the leader of the anti-fascists,
Matteotti, on the first anniversary they went to put a big crown of flowers at
Garibaldi’s memori — thing, and the fascists picked them up again and tossed them
in jail, and that’s how that happened.
Q: So in some ways they made him an anti-fascist.
A: Yes
Q: He had the inclination —
A: He said — you know, there were many people who were anti-fascist, but the
difference was between those who became actively, and that became that. Now,

fast-forward to 1963, and the march on Washington —

the time there were bombings in Alabama, congress fled town, everybody was
scared. And I had a one year old child, Bianca, Jonathan’s wife, and I thought
gee, you know, the march will take place, it doesn’t really need me. And so —
during the week before the march, I’m talking to my father on the phone, and he
said, oh, I’m going to Washington this weekend. And I said, why? And he said,
I’m going to the march. And I — I thought of him as being very old, he was maybe
20 years younger than I am now, but you know how kids are, and I said, but it may
be dangerous. And he said, I’m going. I said, well, then I’ll go with you. And he
said, I thought you would. And of course, we went together, and it was a
tremendous experience for me, to be there as part of that wonderful event. Not so
much the speeches now one talks of, but just walking with thousands of people,
holding hands, and so on. And it made a big difference to me, and I know that my

Fascist, you know, dictatorial countries don’t want people to leave. But you could
get out if you had a fellowship for a year, you know, or a term, or something of that

very Catholic, very friend of the Pope Pius the 11", and very anti-fascist, and had
gathered a group of people around him, who were anti-fascist. And my father was
his right hand, and — and — and — an associate professor of cardiology there. The
story of the pope is that the pope died the day before he would have issued an

encyclical — there’s a book about that — an encyclical, with burning sorrow,
excommunicating Mussolini, and declaring that Hitler was a pagan, because of the
racial laws. And he died the night before.
Q: Is that encyclical still written, available?
A: It was th — it never got out.
Q: No.
A: Probably Oliver La Farge here, had something — a — a great deal to do with it.
He was a man who did much interracial things. The new pope, of course, was Pius
the 12", and he wou — issued an encyclical under the same name, that did nothing.
My father — actually, it was called — the pope was from Milan and was friends with
this guy in Milan. And months before he died, he didn’t trust his Roman doctors,
and he had my father, actually go — he wanted this guy, who was my father’s chief,
who was his friend, but he had heart trouble, and so my father was the one who
went down. The “New York Times” reported, a week or two later, that he had
been seen by this great it — Milanese cardiologist, and then gave the name of my
father’s chief, because in the interim, the racial laws had been passed, and so my
father became a non-being.

I want to kind of turn the story to a very personal perspective, and that is you as a
little boy.
A: Yes.
Q: And growing up in Milan, what some of your earliest memories are, and I'll ask
more questions from there.
A: Yeah. So, my memories of growing up in Milan are memories of a quiet
childhood, going to school there, going on vacation —
Q: Public school?
A: — often. Vacation was a kind of complicated thing for families like ours. In June,
one — I’m sorry, in July, one went to the seashore for a month. In August one went
to the mountains, and in September, one went to, in this case my mother’s parents’
villa outside Bologna. And the father of the family would join you for a m— on
weekends, and the month that he took vacation. And my father, being a mountain
climber, would join us in August, when we usually would go in the Dolomites,
sometimes in Va-Val d’Aoste, but usually the Dolomites, and almost always, the
whole family would manage to go, cousins, aunts, uncles, to the same place. I
mean, arranging where you went, you would rent houses in someplace on the shore,
and everybody would go there. And one year you’d be in the Adriatic, another the
Mediterranean, and that would be that. And I have many, many memories of these

times, both in the mountains, and photographs of us in the mountains, and in the
seashore, and all of those things with my cousins. And we were all very calm,
because my parents, though actively anti-fascist, did not make a point of saying this
to us, especially because my father was determined to leave, and he thought there
will be time enough to talk about those things, but anything of that sort that was
told to us, might make it, in fact, even more difficult. So we grew up, and were at
school, public school, because in Italy everybody went to public school, unless you
were either very stupid, or totally bigoted, but you just didn’t go to any other kind
of school. There was an event which says something about the underlying life.
Sometime during my first grade, which would be 1938, I guess, there was a large
funeral of some fascist bigwig. And the fascists wanted everybody, all the children
in schools, to march in the funeral parade, in uniform, because we were all
supposed to march in uniform, and do all things in uniform, and things. And my
older brother, who was in third grade, at an age where they already marched with
rifles, with guns.
Q: Really? And eight and nine year old boys?
A: Yes, yes, which may say something about my attitude about guns. And said,
we’re not gonna march. This is ridiculous, children with guns shouldn’t march, this
is all so— where he got that, I do not know.

Q: He told his teachers?
A: He told me that we were not going to march. I said fine, because he was my
older brother, I always did what he wanted. And I said, how are we gonna get out
of it? He said, we’re going to say that our uniforms are being washed, and we can’t
afford to have two sets. Of course, it was ridiculous, but we didn’t know that. And
we insisted, and we did not march. With the result that I got that term, the only
failing grade I have ever gotten. It was, I failed fascist behavior, comportomento
fascista, and it’s right there on my report card, for —
Q: I mean, if there’s a badge of honor, there it is.
A: Yeah, there it is. So, this is by way of saying that there was this funny,
underlying kind of a thing of — that we may have known more, or at least my
brother, who was just eight, nine — he was two and a half years older than — than I,
eight at that time. We — that we kind of were there, and you know. Now, you asked

very well being at my mother’s parents’ villa outside of Bologna. I remember very
well Florence, where we would always go in the spring for Pasqua.
Q: Passover?
A: Easter. Pesach. I don’t know, I mean, we didn’t celebrate either, and my
grandparents didn’t celebrate either, but it was that time of year, and it’s interesting
that the word for Easter in Italian is Pasqua, which is both Pesach and Easter, and
that we would always go, wherein Florence was in flower by then, while Milan
was likely to be foggy, so it— my memories of going to my grandparents in
Florence, and they had a wonderful garden, and the gardeners were marvelous
people and played with us and so on and so forth. These are wonderful memories of
that — the house, as storied during the war, how it survived and didn’t and so on.
All of that. But I have no memory of going to the house in Ferrara, or to seeing
that. And I was thinking about that just now, and the answer is quite obvious. My
grandparents were prohibited from going there by the fascists. So, of course I
didn’t go, they didn’t go back to Ferrara.
Q: Because they had been kicked out.
A: And — because they had been kicked out. And so, of course, we didn’t either.

even though it was this family site on my father’s family — my mother’s family was

grandfather couldn’t go there. And I know that once he went, because there was a
funeral of a friend, and he thought he snuck in, and they arrested him. He — we
were rich enough so that none of that mattered.

He had studied agriculture and wanted to put in modern methods and so on, and
was able to convince his farmers to go along with doing these. They wanted to do
things in traditional ways, and he wanted to do that, by promising them that if they
won the prize, he would give it to them. They won the prize, and at that point the
fascists said, you are to give the prize to the fascist party as a sign of solidarity. He
had always been, you know, philosophically anti-fascist, but hadn't done — he had
always argued with my father, my father shouldn’t have gotten into trouble. He,
stubborn, but is — look, I promised the prize to my farmers, I’m giving the prize to

if they were anti-fascist in a mild way. And so that’s what the people who were in

parents both were, come and tell people here, what things were like. Because
Mussolini was saying he made the trains run on time.

opened the great new hospital that my father’s chief had gotten money for. It was
all anti-fascist, but Mussolini came and opened it, and all the newspapers said that.
So they didn’t want people here to say what it was really like. And so the story is,
that when our application for a temporary visa, to go for a term, which should have

been granted, somebody was told, every time it comes to the top of a pile, put it at

This being Italy, we also had somebody in that office who was told, every time it
goes to the bottom —
Q: Bring it to the —
A: — move it near the top. He — neither of these people — this — this person didn’t
have the stamp. Finally, finally, one day the guy who was supposed to put it at the
bottom wasn’t there, and the guy — our guy had put it near the top, and the guy who
was stamping was just stamping, so we got permission. But by this time, it was into
ni — late 1938, and everything had changed, because the racial laws had been
passed. So at that point, we really didn’t even need that, because we were being —
we could be kicked out. But the importance of a fellowship is that it gave us a way
of coming into the United States. Because United States wasn’t accepting people.
Q: Now, do you — did your parents ever tell you about any experiences they might
have had with the U.S. officials in Italy, to be able to come to the U.S.?

A: And there got, at the American consulate there, immigration papers, because we
had this invitation of a fellowship, and we had gotten somebody who had had
business dealings with one of my grandparents, to sign an affidavit. There’s a story
about that, because that person thought that we would never need money, because
we were very wealthy, and they expected that we had money abroad. But both my
grandparents were, as I said, patriots of the old school, and they had no money
abroad.
Q: Everything was in Italy.
A: Everything was in Italy, because that was the law, and they abided by it, even
though they were anti-fascist. But these persons, and interesting was a long term
story about that, about when we arrived, had signed their affidavit. So with that,
since the Italian quota was not being met, because you couldn’t leave Italy if you
were — unless you were Jewish and being kicked out. So it was relatively easy for

keep Hitler from moving into Austria, but had decided to side with Hitler. And
there had been people around him who were anti-Semitic. But anyway, whether
from — not so much from his point of view, he was a nasty man, but that — but
going along with Hitler, passed laws restricting Jews in any number of dramatic

directly. For instance, you couldn’t teach in universities, or anyplace else. And so
my father and my aunt were immediately kicked out of their positions as professors
at that time.
Q: This is your aunt who taught psychology?
A: This is my aunt who taught psychology. And so they — you know, in that, you
also were not allowed, supposedly, to have help of anybody who was Catholic. But
of course, some of the help you’d always had, would stay on, and you also got help
of somebody — we had a French governess who was a Protestant. We didn’t realize
what that meant, but there it was, if you were wealthy. Now, you supposedly could
not hold properties of certain sorts, and more than a certain amount — and I'll have
more to say about that, how that was avoided. And you also were not supposed to

go to school, to the public schools. So these were draconic laws, and they had an
effect on any number of people, and created anti-Semitism, which by and large in
Italy had not been. There had been some church anti-Semitism, and some church
philo-Semitism. There were people in the Catholic church who were very pro-Jews,
and you know, all that complications. But these laws were passed, and at that point,
any number of things happened. As to schools, the Catholic schools, Jesuit schools
were open. They were private schools. So that many of my cousins went to Jesuit
schools, because they weren’t the public schools.
Q: What about you and your brother?
A: We were still, that year, we were still in public schools. So at 1938, we were
still in public school. The matter is more complicated because — and this is
something I hadn't real — realized, but 1t explains some things that my oral historian
found, that in the Italian racial laws, who was not considered Jewish for certain
purposes, including owning of property, was a very complicated matter. Unlike
Germany, where if you had Jewish blood, end of it; if you were the product of a
mixed marriage, and were Christian, you were considered Christian for purposes of
owning property.
Q: Okay.

A: And you could continue owning property. Now, there might be difficulties and
so on, but you could. My mother’s father was born of a Catholic mother, who died
when he was born.
Q: Right, in childbirth.
A: At that point, he converted to Catholicism, with the help of a Dominican who
was very anti-fascist —
Q: So as an 0 — as a grown man, he converted.
A: As a grown man in 1938.
Q: Okay.
A: With the help of a man who was a very important Dominican, fiercely anti-
fascist, fought with the partisans later. His name was Patrick Azatti(ph), I knew
him, I met him after the war, he was a great man. He cou — my grandfather
converted, and told everybody in his family, all the Finzi-Contini and their
relatives, to convert. Because if he converted, he was a Christian, for purposes of
the racial laws. He then married in this ancient, ancient Jewish family, but that was
a mixed marriage. So their children, if they were Catholic, were also Christian in
terms of being able to own property. So all of these people in my mother’s family,
were able to own property.
Q: Did they all convert after he did?

A: They all converted. Some converted and it took, and they remained Catholic.
Some converted and it didn’t, because they were just converting for v — purposes.
Q: Right.
A: My grandfather actually, because of this memory of his mother whom he never
knew, I think actually converted. He died in 1941, and —
Q: Mm-hm. Of natural causes?
A: Of natural causes, of cancer, and — and so, you know, it was in — but that meant
that the properties remained in our names.
Q: Mother’s — yeah.
A: In that side of the family. In my father’s side of the family, the Calabresi, there
was my father and my two aunts. My mother — or, none of whom — my two aunts
were not married. My father was married to my mother, and it’s at that point, only
at that point that my brother and I are baptized. And if I think about it, we were
baptized because my mother thought it was a good idea at that point, and my father
couldn’t be, but partly because my grandfather was saying, this way they will be
able to own property. Because again, half, half, half, half —
Q: Yeah.
A: — but it continues to go all the way through. On the Minerbi side, it happened
that my great-uncle had two sons, and two daughters.

A: My — Beppe, his older brother Julio, oldest daughter Ginevra, and youngest

Fernanda, the youngest, had married my mother’s brother, who through this series
of tricks, was also Catholic. Now, their granddaughter, one of them — two of them
have converted back to Judaism, and so — so it — it’s all —
Q: It gets confusing.
A: It gets confusing.
Q: Yeah.
A: Ginevra had no children. Great-uncle, who owned all these lands and
properties, gives them all to his grandchildren. Why to his grandchildren? Because
they nominally could be Christian, for purposes of this. Now, in fact, there were
any number of pressures, and things a-and of course, none of this matters after
1943.
Q: Yeah.
A: When the Germans come in. But it was a situation in which it looked as though,
if you wanted to, and were rich enough, you could survive, despite these horrible
racial laws.
Q: Survive and still keep some of your assets.

A: Keep your assets, be able to study. My father couldn’t, and his sister, who
would, even if they converted would do no good, because of course, racially, they
didn’t have a Catholic ancestors, but anyway, they wouldn’t, because they didn’t
want to.
Q: Yeah.
A: Couldn’t teach. Couldn’t be — so it — there were all sorts of restrictions, and they
were horrible. On the other hand, my mother’s parents thought we’d be able — what
a — who knows how long this will last? Administrations come and go, and in the
meantime, we’re able to continue to hold our properties, and do these things. So
they didn’t want us to leave.
Q: It lends logic to their point of view.
A: Of course. Of course, completely logical, completely logical.
Q: Yeah.
A: This is our country, we live well. You want to go someplace where you go
without a penny, because it was against the law — I have always said under penalty
of death, it wasn’t penalty of death, 1t was just people who were caught, get killed.

is August of 1939.
Q: Oh my.
A: It is — that much time has passed between finally getting permission, getting
things, getting the American things, everything else. My father, supposedly is
sailing from Genoa on the ship called the Conte di Savoia, which was the second

by this great Patrick Azatti(ph), but it was just a local priest who talked to my
brother and me a little bit, and we da — we were baptized. We didn’t quite know
what [indecipherable] but, you know. And so, for my father, who was sailing off,
the telephone rings and it’s my mother, who says, the ship didn’t sail. They say it’s
engine trouble, and that it might sail tomorrow. Somebody in Rome has told us if it
— war 1s breaking out. If a ship sails, and war is breaking out, we can’t afford to be
separated, so bring the children. If the ship sails, we leave tomorrow, all together.
Q: So your mother ha — gets this phone call from Rome.

called somebody in Rome.

rooms wasn’t what you would use every day. So — but we found our diapers there,
which were made into sheets for examining beds for my father here, because you
couldn’t affo — anyway, and my grandparents are told to bring Paul and me to
Genoa. I remember the trip perfectly —
Q: Tell me.

Q: You were going by train, yes.

th-the way it was done, polite, children [indecipherable]. And so I loved these
very thick, red, velvet cushions and things, and all excited because we were going
to America. We didn’t know what that was, but my brother announced we were
going to America. My mother’s parents are sitting there with their hands on their
canes, looking like death.
Q: Oh.
A: Because their daughter was leaving, and they didn’t know if they would ever see
her again. In fact, my grandfather died — it was an interesting story about that, and
she never saw him, when we left, again. My grandmother survived. And — okay, so
we get to Genoa, with our nanny trying to keep us going, and the ship didn’t sail.

house was damaged, and other things like that. Where do you go? Well, you go to a
country villa outside of Bologna, my mother’s parents were — so my mother’s
parents, my mother and I, my brother, all go to this place outside Bologna.

A: — th-the — the great ship of the Italian lines, that it won the blue ribbon for going

that war has broken out, but Italy has decided not to join. Italy has decided not to
go into the war. They don’t go into the war until June of 1940, when they attacked
France. The hand, Roosevelt says, that has held the dagger, has plunged it into the
back of its friend. So — so Italy is not joining, the ship is sailing. I turned to say this

scene totally in mind, and the phone rings before I can say, it’s my father calling
from Milan, saying that he has tickets on that ship. He had heard before, and had

A: Well, you know, a trip was this fancy ship, and we were doing all sorts of fun
things, and my brother, who is more of a packrat, kept all the things from the
captain, so that on anniversaries he’d bring them out from the captain’s table, and
all the stuff, and how much we did one day, and everything else. And — all of which

Q: Right.
A: The chief justice of Italy, of the Court of Cassation, in the early days of fascism
is aman named Mortada(ph), who is Jewish, who tries to use, what in America
would be judicial review to strike down fascist decrees, but there’s no tradition of
it, and so it fails. And Jews are — if they were of great families, were all over. And
this one was a particularly old and very, very fancy. Tedeschi, by the way, suggests
Ashkenazim, because Tedeschi means German, it means deutsche, it’s the name
Ashkenazi. So if you see somebody, the name Tedeschi often is Jewish in Italy,

Professor, dean, president of Rome University, the greatest law library in the

he was this great figure, still is. His books are all over Catholic universities and so
on. Roscoe Pound, the great dean of Harvard adored him because he was a
functionalist. He made the law do what the — was needed now. Why? Because he
was a fascist. All the anti-fascists were formalists, using the law can’t be changed
to block this. So Roscoe Pound makes him a member of the American Academy,

Hebrew University Law School, and the teacher of everybody there; Aram

Q: What was his name?
A: Also, strangely enough, Guido Tedeschi. Guy Tedeschi, because his father was
Ashkenazi, his mother was Del Vecchio. The story of how he lived there is
interesting, because he had to discover — there was no university for him to teach,
he had to discover some Sephardic ancestor, because there was a fellowship given

A: —1s a double second cousin, but cousin. My aunt left and went to Brazil, and we
went to America, mainly because we were anti-fascist. Everybody else stayed.
Q: What happened to them?
A: Everybody survived.
Q: How?
A: That is a series of stories which is the book that I am writing. And the stories are
wonderful, and they are — they’re interesting in themselves. But the most
interesting part of them are the motives of the people who saved them, in many
instances risking their lives to save them. And the people who saved them ranged
from the poorest peasants, who didn’t even know them, to, in some instances, to the
wealthiest grandees, everything in between. People did things in Italy, which they
did nowhere else. Now, I don’t mean to say there weren’t some people who were
terrible and did other things. I’m just telling the story of my family, and every
single blood relative of mine was saved. The family of Montini, who became pop —
Pope Paul the sixth, saved one branch. They did it, why? And that’s the interesting
thing of this book, what were the motives? Sometimes it was sheer humanity,
sometimes it was friendship, because we were friends. Sometimes it was gratitude,
because we had done things for them. Sometimes it was fame. Respect for fame.

Sometimes motives unknown. But every one of — I told you of the fascist, great
scholar and so on, who walks into the Vatican, and — which was not open to
[indecipherable] Jews. But he walks in, perfectly fine, continues his studies there.
His double first cousin, my great-uncle, who had been president of a Bocconi
University of Milan, economist Gustavo Del Vecchio, great economist, kicked out
by the fascists, because he was anti-fascist. And he, with his sister, who had a
house on Lake Como, gets in a boat, and goes to Switzerland. Switzerland is not
open, any more than the Vatican is. He gets off. The Swiss guard is ready to send
him back, he takes out a letter from Einaudi, who later becomes president of Italy,
and who was his great pal, who was teaching at Zurich, inviting him to teach at
Zurich. The Swiss guards salute, send for a limousine, and he gets taken there.
Exactly the same thing as the other one, as his double cousin. This guy, anti-fascist,
after the war he comes back, becomes a cabinet minister in a postwar government.
When one is up, the other is down. Analogous thing of how they were saved.

the story that she was there — and this is after 1943 — and an American plane that
had been bombing Bologna had somehow failed to drop all its bombs, and is trying
to get up over the Apennines to go back home, and finds that a bomb it has let —
still has, makes it difficult for it to get its height, and so opens the bomb thing, the
bomb falls on the village next to the villa. It was during the day, everybody was out
working, so there weren’t any real casualties, but the village is destroyed. My
grandmother says, so I did what any decent person would do, I invited the village
into the villa. And she said, every family got a room, and we set it all up, and I
taught all the women to work. She did wonderful needlepoint. And I taught the men
to play poker. She was of a generation before bridge, it was what card playing
people would do. We had a wonderful time, she said, and she describes this
wonderful thing, with the whole village living in the villa all together. This almost
90 year old, tiny little person, just teaching. She was always a teacher, and doing

these other things. And then she said, the Germans arrived. They had heard that
there was an old Jewish lady there. So they came to get me. And the village men
came out with pitchforks, hatchets, you know, and said to the German captain, over
our dead bodies. They had been taken in. And the German captain looks at it, and
realizes that, of course, he could mow them down, but he’s probably lose some
men, and it would be — and thinks, here’s an almost 90 year old person, she’s gonna
die anyway. It isn’t worth it. And goes away.
Q: Amazing.
A: And that’s how she survived.
Q: Amazing.
A: And that’s one of the stories. The stories of the others are all different, all
wonderful, and are part of the thing. I'll tell — just say two other things about that.
One, Beppe’s father, the person whose great house it was, refused to hide.
Q: This is in Ferrara?
A: In Ferrara.
Q: Yeah.
A: And no one knows why he refused to hide. Some people say that he thought that
if he was there and was taken, his children — they might leave his children alone.
Which, of course, would not have happened. No one knows. There is reason to

believe that he was the prototype for the old professor in “The Garden of the
Finzi-Contini,” who wouldn’t hide because it was beneath them.
Q: So this is the Finzi-Contini family head
A: This is — the book is being written —
Q: That’s right.
A: — under the patronage of this guy’s son, and somebody — some people have
written — Sergio Minerbi, the guy —
Q: That’s right.
A: — who has written in Israel, has written a family history, and he says it’s true, I
don’t know how he knows. But it’s plausible that the model for that —
Q: Is the —
A: — not hiding, because it — because — 1n the garden it was because it was beneath
them. We don’t know —
Q: Okay.
A: — why this guy? He actually gets taken, and would have been sent off, taken by
the fascists, would have been turned over to the Germans, and would have been
sent off. The story of how he is rescued by his chauffeur, 1s another wonderful
story, one version of which was written up in a book called “Alberto Ms Longest
Day.”

Q: I saw that on the internet, I wondered what that was.
A: Yeah. That book was written by my cousin, my double cousin —
Q: Okay.
A: — the one I was telling you about before —
Q: Yeah.
A: — who was a professor of geophysics, but was also a poet and an author. And he
wrote this, which is pa — that story’s partly fiction. That — how that happened is
partly fiction, it was meant to be —
Q: The longest journey, yeah, that longest —
A: — a fiction, at the longest journey.
Q: — journey, yeah.
A: But it’s how this guy, who didn’t try to hide, was none the less rescued by his
chauffeur, who was a Figaro type, who could do anything, and did it. So — so that’s
another. But anyway, these stories are something that when my book comes out,
will all be there, all of it. What I did want to say was, what happened to my
mother’s father, because it has some interesting things for my job as a judge,
actually. In 1940, before America joins the war, my mother’s father develops
cancer, and he was, as I say, a neurologist, way back. Turns out not to be operable,
though probably — don’t know why, but it was cancer, but sometimes it’s curable,

but it wasn’t. He forbids anybody from telling my mother. This is a man,
remember, who didn’t want my mother to leave, but he forbids anybody from
telling my mother that he is sick, because he knows that if my mother knows that,
she’ll get on the first ship and go back. And probably end up separated from her
family.
Q: Wow.
A: My mother first hears that he is sick in a telegram from the family saying that he
is dying, in early 1941, before America is in the war. Italy is in the war now.
Q: Yeah.
A: And saying that he is dying. And so in — actually, she first hears from a telegram
of condolences over fa — first from my father’s sister, who is in Italy. And the thing
is — interesting to me as a judge, because I’ve seen cases — I’ve sat on cases where
the board of immigration appeals and immigration judges said somebody, who said
they were persecuted, and has sought asylum, went back to their country, and then
came back. So it cannot be that they were being persecuted. And we had a case,
and people on a panel with me, the other two judges, were ready to say obviously
that’s so. And I said no, it’s not obviously so. Of course it’s relevant if the person
goes back, and you want to find out why. But I can tell you that that isn’t
necessarily so, and here is this story. And so my panel held that you cannot make it

as a matter of law that somebody who goes back can’t, you have to look to see why
they went back —
Q: The circumstance, yeah.
A: — and so on. So those are a couple of stories. The others survived, as I say, in
wonderful, mixed ways, and I —
Q: You know, when you’re — this kind of outcome, there are lots of questions, and I
understand you’ve got a book that is in the — in the working, and I, you know, it’s
whetting my appetite for it. But the stories that you are saying, and the summary
that you are giving, spell a kind of experience that too many other people did not
have in other countries.
A: That is true. And one of the reasons I want to write this, is because what
happened in Italy — and again, now some people, including some c-cousin of mine,
are writing about the people in Italy who did betray, who did behave badly. But
more people were saved in Italy, than in any other country, with a possible
exception of Denmark. And in Denmark it was the official policy of the king, and
people just followed it wonderfully, and people were saved. In Italy, what was
interesting about it was that it was against the policy of the government, and yet
people behaved in ways which saved people. Now, a fair number of people were
taken. About 10,000 people were taken in Rome, right after Italy surrendered,

because the Roman Jewish community was — there was an old community around
the old Italian temple, of people who were relatively poor, and still living there, as
against all these assimilated people all over. They too didn’t think that anything
was going to happen. And the Germans moved in, and took any number of them, a
few days, right after. And it’s that that gave the signal, and everybody else went
hid, afterwards. So it immediately, a fair number. So if you look a fair number of
people were taken. After that, very, very few people were taken, because Italians
hid people. Why? That’s part of the story of this book. I mean, sometimes, just
humanity. Sometimes — and you know, sometimes the churches hid people. The
cardinal archbishop of Florence was maybe the only man to vote against Pius the
12" [indecipherable]. He was much loved by people, and they tell the story, which
I repeat in the book, but it isn’t my story, but — but he told all the monasteries and
nunneries to hide people. And that some people were being hidden in a nunnery,
which had been a closed nunnery, and there were men who were being hidden, and
—and young men and young nuns, and inevitably people started making love, and
the Mother Superior is said, according to the story, that is very popular with
Florentines, goes to the cardinal and says, terrible sins are being committed here,
we cannot have this going on. And the cardinal says, Mother, what do you think is

A: Which is a lovely story, I mean —
Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A: — you know, this is a story that is told there, and there are squares named after
this guy, and so on. So, yeah, you know, sometimes, as I say, it was just humanity.
And there are people who — Italian peasants who hid Jews, partisans, anti-fascists,
and then, when the war turned around, and Germans were running away, hid them.
They were all people in trouble, one said to me, when they came here. E tutti figli
de mama, they were all some mother’s child. We struggled for them.
Q: Simple, but very profound.
A: And it’s a— you know, a very — there was something about that culture — and I
don’t mean there weren’t people who didn’t, but there was something about that
culture that caused people to save people. And by the way, it is the reason why
almost all Italian Jews who fled, went back.
Q: You anticipated my next question.
A: We did not. And a few others did not, but most people did go back to Italy, in a
way that people did not go back to Germany, for sure, or Poland, or other

countries, because the feeling that after all, that Italy has — and by the way, if you
said — you know, somebody could say there were so few Jews in Italy, and they
were so assimilated, and so on — that was true in many other countries as well, but
— but there are some figures that give the lie to that, because it’s said that about
10,000 Jews from Croatia, from the —
Q: Right.
A: Who had been protected when it was Italian territory, and was a whole thing of
Germans trying to find out whether these people were really Italians, or from
someplace else, or something, but who were not at all Italian, they were — when
Italy surrendered, fled into Italy from Croatia. And it’s said that of these 10,000
people who fled, who were completely unassimilated, only eight people were
taken. So it — people were hidden. And it’s — it’s something about — and who
knows? I mean, you know, that’s one of the reasons I’m writing this book, because
each of us, in our lives, faces situations where we may be called on to do things,
and there are always excuses. And these people were risking their lives.
Q: I was thinking of this question as you were speaking. Or shall I put it — this is
half a question, half a comment. I’ve interviewed people who are — I’ve

more, but they can trace back that much. And sometimes when I’ve met them, they
speak English with a German accent. Some of them still speak very good German,
you know, it’s their first language. And I will sometimes ask the question, so what
part of you is German? And it’s very hard to answer.
A: Yeah.
Q: Very, very hard to answer, because there was such a profound rejection.
A: Yeah.
Q: And the rejection was not just state edicts, it went through society. But it also
prevented someone who was the target of these edicts, and laws, and
discrimination, from taking that which had been part of them, and being able to
incorporate it, and keep it.
A: Yeah.

A: A hundred percent. I mean, you know, my — I’m a hundred percent Italian, I am
Jewish. I’m a hundred percent American, because I have become American. And I

but whom do your root for when there’s a World Cup in soccer? And I —
Q: When the rubber meets the road.
A: Yeah. My answer was automatic. Of course I root for Italy. But if it were a
world cup in baseball, I’d root for reuta — United States. And it’s not that the
United States is better in one than in the other. In the last World Cup, United
States was good and Italy was terrible. It’s just that I associate one with Italy, and
so then I’m Italian. And I associate the other one with America, and so of course,
I’m a Yankee fan, of baseball. And that’s the way that is. And I am in that sense,
why didn’t we go back? And that’s an interesting story in itself, which has to do in
a way, with what’s happened later, but think of it this way. Comes late 40s, 50s, my
parents go back and see, and are undecided. My father probably is leaning towards
going back.
Q: He who wanted to leave.
A: He who wanted to leave, but you know, fine. My mother may be more likely to
want to stay here, oddly, because my father had been able — his family, his sister
and his mother, after the war, had joined us here, or were going to join us if we —
but he thinks in terms of going back, maybe. He is having a career here, but yeah,
you know. My mother, oddly in some ways, because it is easier for a woman,

strangely, to have a career in Italy than here — she couldn’t get appointed to the
Yale faculty, though they tried, because women were not teaching at Yale at the
time. But she thinks if she goes back, people will not take her career seriously,
because she is too much this elegant lady, you know, and that — but they’re
uncertain. So the thing falls, in many ways, on my brother and me. And my brother
and I, separately, first he goes back, because he’s older. Then a couple of years
later, I go back. And we both have the same reaction, that 1t would be horrible to go
back to Italy and be poor, because this is after the war, and everything is still — but
to go back to Italy and be who we were, with all the losses, because buildings were
hit, things were not looked after, properties had to be put in other names
[indecipherable] the Calabresi things to survive, because they didn’t fit to that
category, and so on. So we were not as rich, by any means, as we were before, but
we're still. But to go back and be wealthy, was something that we were too
American, too egalitarian to conceive of doing.
Q: It made you that, yeah.
A: We had become outsiders, coming to America, and to be insiders, as we would
have been there, was something that my brother and I, both instinctively, could not
take. I will tell you my own experience in that. I go with the chauffeur who saved
Alberto M, who was still there. He drives me around to see the family lands.

Q: This is in the early 50s?
A: 1951. I should have gone in ’50, didn’t go because of the breakout of the Korean
war. Drive around in the ancient family Lancia, which still exists. He’s driving,
I’m sitting in what would be the driver’s seat, because snobbery among Italians,
you have the driver on the English side, to copy English cars, although you’re
driving — so, madness. So I’m there, you know, thinking I’m driving, as we go
sweeping down. A little religious procession comes along, and they see the family
Lancia. They all pull to one side, and bow. I’m a teenager. Who are these people
bowing to me? We go by a church, and I say, that’s a very beautiful church, and —
little tiny church — and the chauffeur says yes, you own it. Well, your cousin owns
it. And the bell is even more beautiful, and of course, it’s in Ferrara because it’s
too beautiful to leave out here. I can’t take that. So we say to my parents, we want
to stay. And that’s what makes the decision.
Q: Amazing.
A: We stay. Because they were undecided, I mean, they really, essentially, left it up
to us. The irony of this, of course, is that we did not see the great inequalities in the
United States. Remember, blacks were not visible. It’s before 1953, before Brown
vs Board of Education. All the inequalities of the United States are kind of hidden
to kids just growing up in a university town. In the meantime —

uncle going to the cabinet and becoming Minister of the Treasury [indecipherable]
the great Italian miracle of the 50s and 60s, which changes Italy into an almost
totally middle class society. Today, all these land are owned by farmers. The
church is a little museum owned by there, the bell is back there. We own nothing of
that. We’re still well-off, but not the kind of feudal thing — in many ways, by 1970,
Italy is a much more egalitarian society than is the United States. In some ways
not, less mobility, but in many ways. So that the irony of our decision was that we
were moved by very good things. Whether it the right one or not —

but you know, I was used to being — why do we stay in New York rather than
come to New Haven immediately? The fellowship doesn’t begin til January, and
my father, correctly, thinks the licensure exams for medicine, in New York, have
more reciprocity than those of Connecticut. If you pass Connecticut, yeah,
Connecticut will recognize it, but almost none — almost every state recognizes a
New York medical license. If we’re going to starve, we might as well starve in
New York, as in —
Q: Was it as difficult in those days for a doctor, certified by another country?
A: You had to — I mean, you could, with the qualifications he had, take the exams,
and if you passed the exams, you would be okay. Increasingly they made it
difficult. Increasingly they made it difficult. And interestingly, the exams in New
York were already making it difficult for people primarily who came from
Germany, and they did that by having the language, have all sorts of words which
were Latinate words. Which of course, my father, who spoke German perfectly,
and spoke English with a huge accent — German was his first lang — second
language, French was his third language, English he learned and knew well, but
spoke like a cultivated Italian would, if you thought it should sound like German.

Which was not good. My mother, instead, spoke English with an English accent,
French was her second language, English her third language, because she had had
an English governess. Have you any autumn apples? When she came, it was how
she spoke. But he found the language exam funnily easy, because of that. The other
exams, what he worried about most was surgery. He had been an academic, so that
most other things to do with medicine, even if they weren’t his field, he would
know. And as he said, he turned lucky in that, because the guy who was the
examiner in surgery, was one of the first people to do color — cardiovascular
surgery, to think about that. And he had read some articles of my father’s as a
cardiologist, and so knew who he was. And he said to him, I must give you a real
surgical question. It was an appendectomy, which even my father could handle.
And then he said, now let’s talk about interesting things, the future of
cardiovascular surgery. So he passed that. And so he passed, flying colors, before
the end of December, so that in January, when we came to New Haven, he had his
New York license.

Germany. And when, because of the connection between one of my grandparents
and this guy, signed ours, saying, I know you'll never need anything. So, my
mother goes to call on this lady, and she had jewelry, because we’d hidden it in our
things. And this was not jewelry we had bought; if so they would have looked for
it, but this was jewelry, so she — she said, I put on more jewelry than a lady should,
and went to have tea, for — and said, our money has not yet arrived from
Switzerland, could you advance us something? This was technically true because
my father had given a lecture in Switzerland, and had gotten, I don’t know, 50
dollars, something like that, and that money had not yet arrived. So it had my — this
woman says, of course, and writes a check. I do not know the precise amount. The

She’s thinking of people living in the way we lived in Italy. So of course. What do
you do with a check for 25,000 dollars at a time when you think the banks are still
failing? You know, it’s true now we look back, the depression was over, but —
Q: Yeah.
A: — nobody really knew it. We had no bank account anyway, but how could you —
something which we could never pay back. What do you do with it? Well, what
you do with it, there were a few other Italian émigrés, some Jewish, some not, who
were there in New York, that was a small community of people, and some of them
had a little bit of money, because they had had money out of Italy. And of course,
everybody who had that was just as —
Q: Nervous.
A: — tight with it as could be. Among these people, by the way, was a woman
named Kalabi(ph), who became, after the war, the head of the Italian Jewish
community in Italy. A great, great lady. A-And she was our first babysitter. She
came and — one time when my parents actually went to a movie, it was the only
time, and she was with us. Well, my parents gave this check to some people who
had money and said, give us a few hundred dollars, this check will be your security.
And with these few hundred dollars, we had barely enough money to live. Comes

these machines, there’s a young American bride here. The woman isn’t terribly
interested, and the hairdresser persists, until finally, this woman, just to shut him
up, turns to Anne and says, what is your name, my dear? And Anne says proudly,
Anne Tyler Calabresi. Woman almost goes through the machine and says, related
to Dr. Massimo? Said yes, he’s my father-in-law. She said, I’m the person who
signed his affidavit. She was a patron of Spoleto, the festival, and had promised her
grandchildren if they learned the language, that she would bring them to that
country. And so she was there, bringing her granddaughter to Spoleto and so on,
just by chance. And Anne, of course, says, I know exactly who you are, and tells

Q: Italy, America, Italy, America.
A: He is lucky, because this rinky-dink school had a class for non-English speaking
children. So he finds himself, he’s in fourth grade, in a class with many German;
some French, who knows why; Spanish, which of course, we can converse with,
children. And so he is immediately at home, in his proper grade, and because of
that, first learns English perfectly. The teacher is there to teach them American, he
speaks good American, no accent of any sort, but just wonderful, and his — no one
could say he was not born here. I, instead, am too young to go into that class. I
should be in second grade, I get put in kindergarten, because I don’t speak English.
We spoke German and French. We’d had a German governess and a French
governess, and so we both spoke German and French, we did not speak English.
On the ship, my mother tried to teach me, and I didn’t want to, I was having too
much fun. Once she catches me, and it is the source of what is a true statement that
I said, when I came to America I knew three words of English, yes, no and
briefcase. Briefcase because she had this book that her governess had used to teach
her English, and all these children were going to school carrying satchels, and I
said, what’s that, and she said briefcase. I liked the sound of it, so I remembered — I
didn’t want [indecipherable]. So yes, no and briefcase.

A: I was doing, in Italy, math at a fifth grade level, already. What these children
are doing in kindergarten are just tying — making necklaces and tying things. So I
bring it up to the teacher, and she clearly is not pleased with it, so I do it again.
She’s still not pleased with it. This goes on all morning, or day, or whatever. I
come back the hotel and I say to my mother in Italian, cosa vuol dire, what does it
mean, pull tighter?
Q: Pull tighter.
A: So I believe that I was teased mercilessly.
Q: Oh.
A: I say that — I blocked a good deal of that, but I say that because when we went to
Italy on sabbatical, and our daughter Bianca was three years old, our ancient
nanny had come back to look after the children, and took her to the park across the
way from where we were. And our three year old, who was very durable, runs up to
some little children who were playing, and I kind of follow in the back, to see
what’s going on, to two little girls who are playing, and says something in English.

And they don’t understand, and pick up their things, and go away. And I don’t
know that Bianca was particularly upset. I mean, she moved down to something
else, was just I raced back to the house, and realized how I was reliving a difficult
kind of experience. One introduction to America, we get brought to this school,
and teachers in Italy, no matter, you know, how old or young, always wore black,
very — very simple kind of thing. We arrive at this school, and my kindergarten
teacher is a big, blousy New Yorker, with all sorts of colored —
Q: Frills.

and said to my father, I don’t really understand this country, but I’m afraid that
Guido’s teacher may be a prostitute. Culture is different. So we — I — I am there,

money so that we don’t have to rely just on the food of this —

wonderful 1930 things, all chrome and shiny and things and you put in 10 cents,

wearing little tweed coats, fur coats. Winter things in Italy, and we thought of
America that way, so you know, nicely, wonderfully elegant. My brother comes
home and says, I cannot wear this. My mother said — no one is wearing it, just, I
cannot wear anything like this. My mother says, okay. With no money that we
have, she understands that this child is — and so we go to some five and dime
someplace, to look for something. And she looks at all sorts of parka and things,
she said, they’re all wearing parkas. And the — whatever, and we look, which fairly
costly, and good looking. And he said no, no, no, no. And he then sees something
which is a quite ugly, black and green kind of pressed something or other thing,
which is very cheap, and he says, that’s what everybody’s wearing. And my mother

A: And my father, by the way, had — and this became a problem — he had been an
associate professor. In 1936, very, very young for Italian, he had written a book on
cardiology, one of the founding books on ki— electroca-cardiographs, and things,
which had won the gold medal for the best scientific book of the year. And there
was a competition for a full professorship. His chief was part of the commission,
and had the other two votes, the commissioners, five, to put him in. But said, I’m
going to be here next year as well, with the same committee, and there’s somebody
senior to you. If I put you in this year, this other guy will never make it. Will — do
you mind being put off for a year? My father said, of course not. The next year the
fascists were strong enough so that they could block it. Whether it was that he
wouldn’t take a loyalty oath, or something, I don’t know. But the next year, when
he should have gone through, he didn’t. With the result that we came before he be —
was a tenured, full professor.
Q: Would that have made a difference?
A: That would have made maybe some difference here. It certainly would have
made a difference after the war, in terms of Italy. But it certainly made life more
difficult, because he didn’t have a title. And, you know, when I was offered,
extremely young, a full professorship at Chicago, in my first year of teaching, and
decided to turn it down, because I wanted to stay at Yale, well they couldn’t

promote me immediately, I told the dean, I know it’s all right, but you must
understand that psychologically it’s more difficult for me. And he did some
wonderful things about comforting me in this. And then I became a full professor
in a year or two later, very, very young still, but it was part of, again —
Q: Well, it was — it was part of —
A: — of the history.
Q: Yeah, of the history.
A: Yeah, part of that. So, in January, we come to New Haven, to be — for this
fellowship. Now first — I didn’t know it at the time, and my parents never told me,
but recently, a dean of a medical school found the letter from the head of the
internal medicine, to my father, telling him his fellowship was there, and he could
come on such and such a time, and what it was. And sent me this letter. A copy of
this letter.
Q: When you say recently, in the past few years or so?
A: What?

A: Yeah, about three, four years ago.

A: Well, now maybe — you know, could now be 10. But was at some point a dean
found it in the files and sent it to me, but just —
Q: Decades after the event.
A: — decades — decades after. It’s the most insulting letter you can imagine.
Q: What did it say?
A: It said, somebody has given us money to give you a fellowship, and so we’re
doing it. Try to get them to give us more money. Don’t think that you’ll be able to
stay more than this time, and don’t think you can do this, this, this or this. You’ve
been given this fellowship, we’ve been given the money, but essentially said, we
don’t really like people like you.
Q: So the welcome mat was really put out.
A: Yeah. Understand that this was a Yale that at this time had never had either a
Catholic or a Jewish full professor in Yale college. It wasn’t until 1946 that Yale
had a Catholic or full professor — or Jewish full professor in Yale college. Harvard
wasn’t much before that, it was when Conant became president, which is one of
the reasons Harvard got so far ahead of Yale, because Conant became president
before the war, and so all the refugees could go to Harvard. Schumpeter, the
great economist, wanted to come to Yale, but couldn’t, had to go to Harvard. He

had many friends among the economists at Yale, but this was Yale college. The
law school was different, and had been different forever —
Q: At Yale.
A: — to its glory. At Yale. It had a Jewish full professors, Catholic professors,
Catholic acting dean, in the 19" century admitted women. The law school was
always the troublemaker, which is why I love it, and always different. The medical
school, slightly different. The dean of the medical school, Winternitz, was Jewish.
Some said very anti-Semitic, but he was Jewish. There were some Jews on the
faculty. Still an enormous quota, I mean, you know. The first person in the class
was always Jewish, because to be Jewish, to be admitted to the medical school, you
had to be — but — but at least it was mildly open, but — but just barely, in the
medical school. And apart from the dean, I don’t know that there were any full
professors who were Jewish, but anyway.
Q: Is this where your father was attached?
A: This was where my father was attached, the fellowship was to the medical
school. The person he was working with, Arthur Geiger, who was in cardiology,
was Jewish, was not a full professor, was an associate professor. But — so it’s not
surprising that this letter, that a previous president of Yale, who had just left a few
years before, James Rowland Angell, was a fascist and worse. I mean, he actually

wrote a letter saying, if there could be something like what happened to the
Armenians in New Haven and Bridgeport, we might be able to save our Nordic
heritage. This was not uncommon, with Lowell at Harvard, and Butler at
Columbia. You know, it was the way people thought at that time. So I say, the law
school was different, we had nothing to do with the medical school, was slightly
different, and so on. That’s where my father, because a fellowship had — money
had been given to them, and maybe the Dazien(ph) foundation was doing this
because they wanted to open it. Who knows why they gave it here. But — so, we
arrive. And the real estate agent comes to try to find us a place to rent, a little house
to rent, and immediately shows us places on Worcester square, which was where
the Italians lived, or in Westville, where the Jews lived. And we get shown places
there, and the people from the medical school kind of sweep in, and say no. What
they essentially said, you are ethnically Yale.
Q: There’s a new ethnicity, it’s called Yale?
A: It wasn’t ethnic, I mean, you live between Whitney Avenue and Orange Street,
between the park and Edward Street, because that’s where all the fellows, assistant
professors, young Yale faculty live. And so they found us a nice little house, still
there, in that area. An area, by the way, which is still today full of Yale fellows,
assistant professors and so on. Now, ethnically of every ethnicity, but still remains

there. But that was the area where young faculty members lived. Which 1s perfectly
fine [indecipherable] they said, you know, this is what you are. Now imagine we
arrive there, everybody who is there, is a WASP. We have in common with them
that they are faculty and academic, but ethnically, culturally, extraordinarily little.
Q: Well, you know, one of the —
A: And, if you look then to the Jewish community, we had almost nothing to do
with people who were wonderful, mainly Ashkenazim. Couldn’t believe that we
were Jewish, that my father, particularly the — he took, when he would see them,
the medical school and so on, as patients, to speaking to them in German, because
then they thought, oh then maybe this person sp — speaks an odd dialect of Yiddish.
To convince them that actually — you know, because — and the Italian community,
almost all southern; very, very poor.
Q: Southern Italy.
A: Southern Italy. A-Again, very little to do with this. Now, with one odd
exception. There were a few left wing anti-fascists who had been ostracized by the
community because the fascists had played very much this — you must be more
fascist than the fascists if you’re here and so on. And these people, when they heard

that my father had arrived, knowing about him and his anti-fascism, were so
thrilled at having somebody who was a —
Q: Kindred spirit.
A: — and a kindred spirit and cultivated, that several of them made him executor of
their wills, even though he was a doctor and knew nothing about law. And there
was a barber named Malefronte(ph). I — I remember, I just met somebody who was
the granddaughter of this barber’s partner, and said, you know, I think that — so it —
and my parents got very much involved in the doing things for the Italian
community. But we were part of, in a way, nothing. My mother became the first
Italian member ever, of something called the Cerco Il’Italiano, which was a group
of elderly Yankee women who read Dante and other things. But they’d never had
an Italian having — for friend, that they should.
Q: I want to make a comment here, is that —
A: I’m sorry?

end of two years, they offered me a fellowship, which would have been the end of a
career, having a fellowship at Magdalen College, that’s it, 1n economics, perfect. I
didn’t want to take that, problems with economics, but partly because I would
immediately fit in a category of society, and — there, and I said, if I wanted to fit
somewhere, I’d go back to Italy, you know? There, the moment I’m there, Anne
says I melt into the woodwork when I go over.

went to Rome because there weren’t many — my great-aunt and great-uncle were
there, but they were much older, and we wanted to make our own friends, and so
on. We made friends, and we found, inevitably, that the people we liked were
people whose grandparents were on the same side of this fight or that with my
grandparents, and you know, it — it’s that kind of a country. Well here, we were

won a fellow — a scholarship to a little private school here, and she was in that
class. My then college roommate, who was from New Haven, and so on, said, oh, I
am so — my parents are so glad. And I said, why would they care? I mean, what
they — and he said, because people ask them who your roommate is at Yale, and —
we had three roommates — and I — and I tell them, somebody named Guido
Calabresi, and my parents’ friends, business types, said, who are they? And now
my parents can say, oh, he is married to these people. So, to them, this was a way
of saying, there is now —

A: He’s somebody. And now, I don’t know the extent to which both my brother

rebuild here, what we had there. Somebody has seen the farm where I live, which is
very beautiful, which we got —
Q: Here, in — in Connecticut.
A: — somewhere here, in Woodbridge, yeah. And — and it’s a beautiful place. We
got it for almost nothing when we were first married, but it was — it’s a huge
number — amount of land, and an 18" century house, and it’s been made — we’ve
worked at it, and it’s really beautiful. And somebody who was studying at the law
school, who 1s a writer, wrote a book in which he said, this house, which looks like
a villa in Tuscany. And I said to him, you’re right and you’re wrong, it’s not in
Tuscany, and it’s outside of Bologna. But it’s, in a way it’s rebuilding my
grandparents’ villa outside there. So there is some side of people like me, who must
rebuild and reestablish, so that now, you know, I’m an outsider in some ways, and
yet, people know me and our children and — and —
Q: Do you still feel an outsider?
A: Yes. And in some ways, I really still am. It’s a funny business. I teach a course
with a judge on our court, who is a good friend, who was chief judge. He’s younger
than I am, and I teach a seminar with him. His name is John Walker. He is H.W.

because of where it was. And — and the local Boy Scout troop is the same way, you
know, all these things were this —
Q: Right.
A: — little kind of Yale WASP centered thing. At some point, the Foote school,
which was a wonderful private school, made really wonderful by the fact — by one
fact of discrimination, that Yale had no women teachers, so that many of the
teachers in this little private school were the wives of professors, and immensely
learned, and interesting and so on. You know, you had a level of teachers that was
fantastic. In seventh grade, I get a scholarship there. My parents are uncertain about
private schools, because in Italy private schools were — but the fact that it was an
all day, and anyway, the headmistress, who was English, and who was a wonderful
lady, told them, this really is better level of education and so on. Why did I get that
fellowship — that scholarship. Affirmative action, but not because I was Jewish, not
because I was Catholic, not because I was Italian, even though I probably was
about the only person, maybe one or two others —
Q: Yeah.

A: — of that. Was because I was a boy, and in seventh grade, enough boys went off
to prep school away, that they needed boys, and so they looked to this public
school, and here was this kid. Because, when I came to New Haven, I went back to
second grade, I was doing things back at the level, and clearly they —
Q: Right.
A: — and so that’s why I got the scholarship. I was there, in this school, which was
all the really major professors. A classmate of mine was Sally Griswold, the
daughter of a guy who became president of Yale, and we became, you know, very
close friends. This was the whole entourage there, and lawyers, great lawyers, and
so on. My wife was two years behind me in school. And so, what happens? In those
days, when you get to high school, the mothers of daughters would have dances at
Christmastime, at vacation time, to which proper, eligible people — boys — would be
invited. It was just the way it was, you know, you — a-and they’d have dances in
their homes, and things. It’s kind of interesting, some invited me, and some did not.
As it happened, my wife’s family invited me, because they were people who were
not bigots, and they were friends of the guy who became president of Yale, and
whose daughter was my friend, and of Gene Rostow, who became the first — not
the first Jewish dean, but a Jewish dean of the law school. And — you know, they
knew, and they knew, in a way, who we were. There were people who were very

open, and people who were less so. I can’t say I really noticed or cared, because
our attitude, in a way, was very snobbish.
Q: Your own in turn —
A: My family.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah, I mean, you know, we thought, we were who we were when you people
were painting yourselves blue.
Q: Well, you know, there’s some truth to that.
A: Yeah.
Q: And — and there’s also —
A: And — and so but, in a way, we were — an-and the fact that we didn’t belong,
meant that we would be friends with everybody, but in some ways we also thought
that we were outsiders because we were better than everybody. Which isn’t nice.
But it is part of, at the same time, a feeling that we had to achieve, because if
anything happened to my father and mother, there we were, at least until after the
war, and not immediately after the war, but when things started getting put back
together again.
Q: I want to dwell on this a little bit before it’s — sort of like psychology. In some
ways also, I — I —I take your point where you’re saying that, you know, we thought

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection

July 27, 2017
we were a little bit better than others. You have a certainly illustrious family
history, that can be very convincing to — to feed that. At the same time, when
you’re in the position of an exile and a refugee —
A: And you feel both —
Q: — too many other people didn’t have those reserves and suffered enormously,
internally —
A: Yes.
Q: — because they didn’t have — they felt like they no longer mattered in the world.
A: But it — it — and you know, the odd thing is, if you are that way, you — it really
doesn’t matter. I mean, we had a — my parents had a very, very hard time making it
here. Ultimately they did. Ultimately my father became a full professor. Ultimately
they were recognized in their fields, but they had a very, very hard time. And I
sometimes thought we were outsiders and felt like this, because they were having a
hard time. I don’t think that’s true, and my example of that is Hanna Gray, who
became president — provost at Yale, president of Chicago. Was a couple of years
ahead of me, at this same school. Oh, by the way, this English headmistress was
delighted that she had people who were Italian Jewish, and so on, because she was
somebody who wanted that, and so on. When Hanna was provost, and we were
friends, because of — they were at dinner — lunch at our house once, and I said — we

were talking about the experience coming, and I said, but of course, 1t was very
different for you, because her mother was Jewish, her father was a great German
historian, whose chair at Heidelberg was paid for by the Rockefeller, had been
given by the Rockefeller in 1930s. Because his wife was Jewish, they decided to
leave, and Rockefeller found — whether it was the Rockefellers or a foundation,
said to American universities, whichever one of you wants [indecipherable] Hajo
Holborn was his name, we will give the chair — move the chair there. And he
wasn’t Jewish, so Yale was perfectly willing to have him an-and it was a great,
great story, and so the chair was here, and the — and so I said to Hanna, I expect
your experience was very different from ours, because you came, and your father
was a full professor already, with his chair and that, so on, and — and she looked at
me, and she said, you’re absolutely wrong. And she described her feelings, and her
family’s feelings of being outsiders, 1n exactly the same way. Because it was that
just this sense of there you were somebody, here you are nobody. And this is — it’s
odd. Bob Dahl, the great political scientist, wrote a book called “Who Governs?”
in which one of the things that he does, is talk about who are the social elite, the
political elite, the financial elite, the academic elite in a town. And in New Haven,
he defines these in good political scientist terms [indecipherable]. Financial elite,
anybody who is on the board of directors of any one of different companies.

Interview with Guido Calabresi a
July 27, 2017
Political elite, anybody who is [indecipherable] certain positions, selectman, or
whatever, or selectmen in towns and — and things of that sort. Fine — social elite,
anybody who goes to what used to be the debutante ball in New Haven, a big
dance. And academic elite, anybody who’s full professor. Finds only one person
who is all four. Me. The outsider. Nice irony. Why all four? Well, academic elite,
easy. Political elite, at some point the town of Woodbridge wants to ask me to run
as a — for selectman. Democrats don’t win, but there is minority representation, you
have to have a certain number of things. I’m not particularly interested, I’m saying
I’m in Europe on sabbatical, but if you put my name down, they need a name.
There are Italian Americans living in Woodbridge who always vote republic,
because the Irish are democratic. They know an Italian name, vote for it. Why
didn’t the democrats do that before? Because if you do that, all the Yale people,
and the Jewish psychiatrists and so on, wouldn’t vote for that one. For me, of
course, they all vote. So, easy, I somehow get elected and spend some years doing
that. Financial elite, they’re looking for somebody, two parts of a bank are fighting
with each other. They’ ve never had an Italian on the bank. Compromise, let’s not
fight, let’s put somebody who’s totally an outsider on the bank. So I end up being a
bank director, because I was a full professor, young and Italian, ever looking for a
bank. And social elite, yeah. All the people who get asked by girls who are coming

out, to be their escorts, then get asked to this dance. And since my friends in school
were the ones who were — so — and yet I’m an outsider in all of them.
Q: And you still feel that, that’s the key thing —
A: Yes.
Q: — is that you still feel that.
A: Yes. And when my son, our children were growing up, at some point I was
saying to Massimo, our youngest, how his older sisters, who seem to be so
successful, and this was this younger kid, and the first — the only guy with these
two very powerful sisters. And so I said to him, you know, they — that, you have
insecurities, but realize that your sisters each have insecurities, and I started talking
about their insecurities, and he understood. And then, being a bright little boy, he
turned to me, and he said, and what are your insecurities, Daddy? And I
immediately said, I’m a refugee. I’m a refugee. I’m an outsider. And I — by the
way, I say being a refugee is the most important part of my legal education,
because it shows me what it means to be an outsider, which is very important if
you’re gonna be a lawyer and a judge. Say, I’m a refugee. And he immediately
says, of course, of course. And so is Uncle Paul, only he deals with it in a different
way from you.
Q: What a smart boy.

A: Yeah.
Q: How old was he?
A: But he’s so — he must have been 13 — 12, 13.
Q: But truly a smart — you know, very insightful.
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But he saw when I said that, that of course, there are all sorts
of things that I still feel outside, and so did Paul, but that we dealt with it in
different ways [indecipherable]
Q: Well, you know, of all the things we’ve talked about, the identities; born Jewish,
baptized, and now a practicing Catholic. Italian, refugee, outsider. Which of them
has predominance?
A: Different ones at different times, you know? In an odd way, I have both felt
being outsider because of each of these —
Q: Easily.
A: — at different times.
Q: Yeah.
A: And also, I have used each of these. For instance, when I was dean, to reach out
to different groups, because I saw my parents, though they had nothing directly in
common, reaching out to help people in the Jewish community, help people in the
Italian community. My mother was a Knight of the Italian Republic after the war,

for all she had done for Italian Americans here. Reaching out to the academic
community, reaching out to all of these, and giving to them of that, so that you feel
both apart and outside, but a duty to do something for [indecipherable]. It helped,
you know. When I was dean, there were all sorts of people who are Italian
Americans, who are Jews, who are this, who are that, who are the other. And they’d
see a dean who was also that.
Q: And so they — like many black girls now say.
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: And why Obama was so important to the black community. If he can, so can I.
A: There’s a — there’s a man, Iacobucci, who became a justice of the Canadian
supreme court, dean of the law school at Toronto, and acting president of the
University of Toronto. The first time I met him, he said to me, Guido, you don’t
know how much you meant to me. I said, why? And he said, I was a young kid at
the univer — at law school in Toronto, and I came home one day, I loved law, and I
said to my parents, I want to be a [indecipherable]. And they said, you can’t. And
I said why? And he — his parent said, because you’re an Italian and in Canada and
Toronto — then. Toronto is very different now, but then, you know, that can’t be. I
took out of my pocket, an article in the “New York Times,” how Guido Calabresi
had become the youngest full professor of the history of a Yale law school, and two

or three youngest in the history of Yale. I said, if that can happen to an Italian at
Yale, it can happen here. So, you are, you know. If you know that all of these
things can be of use to others, you then relish every one of these feelings of being a
Q: Of this identity, or that identity, or — what would you like us to understand about
what it is to be a refugee? That is both historical a question, and I think very
currently a question.
A: The first thing is that every refugee is an outsider. And that’s the fundamental
thing. The second is that it has always been the case that there have been people
who helped, and I can tell you, and when I was sworn in, I n-named them by name.
Ziegler Sargent of the Sargent lock company, who went out of his way to help
these little Italian boys — became a — a very good friend of my parents, as a result.
And there are people who stand in your way. And — but if you worry about the
people who stand in your way, you hurt yourself. But if you instead are grateful for
those who help, and then help others in your situation, that makes you something
that makes this country better. You —
Q: One — mm-hm? One of the things that you said about what your parents had
done, and I want to ask more questions about what some of their difficulties were,
was that they engaged. Very often when a refugee will come to a for — very often,

Interview with Guido Calabresi
July 27, 2017
when a refugee will come to a foreign country, they feel so strange and so much
and outsider, and so —
A: Yes.
Q: — different, that they will close in on their own communities.
A: Okay, this is very important, and it’s a great piece of luck. Because of this
fellowship at Yale, and because we were able to hang on and stay here, we were
not part of the Italian refugee community that was centered in New York. We
knew them, or some, in Boston, a few different places, either of anti-fascists, or of
Jews. We knew them, we were a part of them, we had been with them. We would
see them from time to time, so that I went to call on the mother of the Rosselli
brothers, who had been — who was living —
Q: Sure.
A: — in Larchmonts(ph), because that, you know, we did, but — but we were not
part of it, and so we did not close in, in the way such a community does. You s —
those people almost all went back, remained something to themselves, because it
was much easier than dealing with this strange, American world. Because we were
here, and alone, we couldn’t do that. I’ve seen that in other ways. I have a law
clerk, who is now dean of a law faculty at Cornell, named Eduardo Penalver,
whose family fled Cuba. His father did not want to stay either in Florida, or in

New Jersey where the main Cuban — went to Washington State, doctor — that
family — these people are brilliant, wonderful, have done all sorts of things. They’re
much more open, because they had to deal with the rest of the world, and weren’t
able to look in on themselves, and on their troubles, and on their grievances, which
are real. As we could have, had we been part of that little New York community.
So that was something which I don’t think my parents were especially aware. I
think they understood afterwards, that they were doing things which might be hard,
but that they were much more interesting than had they been part of that
community.
Q: Tell me a little bit about how it was that your father was able to hang on after
that unwelcome letter.
A: Yeah, so first, you know, you come to New Haven, you come to this little house
on Willow Street, which is still there. It was the old farmhouse for that area. Nice
little house, wooden, very simple.
Q: Different than Milan.
A: What?
Q: Different than Milan.
A: Slightly different. They still had an icebox in those days, and a — the Hygienic
Ice Company brought the — a month or two after we are there — maybe just a

month, even, the wife of a distinguished professor comes to call on my mother,
because in those days Yale was small enough so that new faculty member — and
fellows were considered faculty members — gets called on by the wife — always the
wife, because it was — the wife calls on the wife, the senior faculty member in some
other department. I’m home from school, and I’m playing — sort of myself, cars or
something, and my mother is giving this lady tea. And this lady asks her how she
likes America, and my mother says, oh, it’s very nice. And then the person,
looking to make conversation says, and what do you think of the plumbing? I
understand that she means, isn’t 1t wonderful to have indoor plumbing, because she
thinks of Italians as people who don’t. My mother doesn’t understand. She just
doesn’t understand. Then, she thinks she understands, and she says, of course, it’s
very simple — compared to a marble bathroom, the sort of thing which is absolutely
normal in Milan, and thing. But after all, what should one expect? And I can tell
that she’s thinking, at least you don’t have Indians firing at us. She’s just as
provincial in her way as the other one is in a way. And I don’t — I, instead, already
understand what each one of them is [indecipherable] say.
Q: Oh my God.
A: Because I’ve been 1n school, you know.

Q: This is sort of like when you speak English and you speak English, and you
need a translator in between.
A: That’s right. And I never tell my mother this, because she would have been
upset, because she didn’t want to be — say something rude, but it was. Neither
understood the other, and it was perfectly fine. So that’s how we are as insider
outsiders. My father is at the medical school, and has this extraordinarily dreadful
accent, because of which it’s very hard to understand him. He knows the language
very well, and he is hanging on by his fingernails.
Q: Oh, poor man.
A: He is a great — he’s a great doctor as well as scientist. He never writes the kinds
of things here, and does the kind of research here that he was doing in Italy, which,
you know, people said this was Nobel prize type of stuff. But never does that here.
But he comes to be loved by students because of what he does. But he is certainly
not — he’s at the fringes, and not appreciated in any way at all. My mother — oh,
they decide that if you’re going to — if we’re going to stay here, it would be useful
to have American degrees. So my father, because of the chairman of public health,
a wonderful man, c-a-o — C.O.A. Winslow, or something like that, liked him, saw
that he was special. And public health was kind of a hobby. Says to my father,
look, take a few courses, when you write an article about something and we’ ll work

it out so you get a doctorate. And so my father gets a doctorate in public health,
with his left hand, thanks to this guy. It’s only — remains only a hobby. My mother
instead, whose field in Italy was philosophy of art [indecipherable] is her
dissertation, so decides to go to graduate school at Yale. She starts out teaching at
what is now Southern Connecticut, it was Teacher’s College at the time, to earn
some money while we’re here. She gets fired in 1941, when America goes in the
war, because suddenly people decide — realize that you’re supposed to be a citizen
to teach in a state college. And everybody’s desperate, but there’s nothing to be
done about it. And anyway, she goes and she teaches — she decides that she’s gonna
get a degree in French, because a French — German-French department, Henri
Peyre, was a brilliant, interesting scholar, and she’d always been interested in
linguistics and literature. So she gets a doctorate in French. And — and that becomes
her field. The head of the French department wants her appointed to the Yale
College faculty. It is said, and I can’t prove it, that 1t goes all the way to the
corporation, which says no. We have no women teachers — no women students in
the college, how can we have women teachers? Logic on logic. So she goes and
teaches at Connecticut College in New London, then Connecticut College for
Women. Interesting story about marriage and things. I say to my mother years later,
when my mother says, you know, I’d wanted to do two things in my life. Three

things. Teach, write and look after my family. Because I wasn’t in a research
university, I could only do two at a time, and she taught and looked after her
family. When she retired — actually, after the war, she — Yale is still closed to her,
she moves from Connecticut College, to Albertus Magnus, a Catholic college
here, because it’s right nearby, and it’s not as fancy. We don’t need it as a backup
any more, but she continues to teach. When she retires, she starts to write, and she
writes — well, a book that she wrote in French. We found a letter from the head of
the Ecole de France when she died suddenly in Italy, saying from now on
Reynaud(ph) scholarship begins with you, so she was able to do that. But I asked
her why they didn’t both leave and go to a research university. And I said, is it
because in those days, women followed men? And Papa was here, and he wanted to
stay here. And she laughed and she said, oh no. What happened was that when this
happened, your father was furious, and wanted to leave.
Q: When they didn’t accept her at Yale.
A: At Yale. Wanted to leave and tried both to go to research universities. And she
said, but I wouldn’t let him. And I said, why? And she said, I wouldn’t let him
because here he was hanging on by his fingernails, and despite his accent, people
were beginning to appreciate him. Not as the scholar he was, but as a teacher, as a
clinician, as a wonderful clinician. And here I thought he would ultimately make it.

I thought if we went someplace else, he wouldn’t. And I knew that I was the
stronger, and the more flexible, and that I could deal with it. And she was a brilliant
woman, and could. Her way of teaching is more like mine than my dad’s. My mom
— it gets complicated, but you — and I said well, but how did you keep them, if —
you know, as a matter of principle, and she smiled and she said, I made a scene.
And when my mother made a scene, it was a scene. And she said, I said to him,
Massimo, you made me leave Italy in a matter of principle, and I left my family,
my friends, and everybody. And you were right. But it was very costly. Now, I’m
beginning to make friends here — she couldn’t have cared less, okay — and you want
us to leave again, on a matter of principle. This one’s on me. We stay. What could
he do? And then she looked at me quite fiercely, and she said, but you must never
tell him. Okay, my mother dies suddenly —
Q: What year?
A: —1n Italy. She was almost 80. My father was giving some lectures, she had gone
there, she had tea with a friend, and her friend said, you look happy. She said, it
was easy to be happy if you’re fortunate in your daughters-in-law, has a heart
attack and dies. My father is upset and doesn’t want to talk about her for months.
Then finally, one evening I’m having dinner with him — he survives her by about
five years, six years. He says to me, you know, your mother was a great lady. And I

said yes. And he says, no, I don’t think you know. And I say oh? He said, you
know, when she couldn’t get an appointment at Yale, I wanted to leave. And I said,
oh? And he said, but she wouldn’t let me. And I said, oh? And he said, she said
[indecipherable] and I said, oh? And then he looked at me and he said, all
nonsense. She knew she was the stronger one, and she never told me. And —
Q: Oh. Oh. How beautiful.
A: Well, and think about a marriage between two people, who in many ways could
not have been more different. I mean, he was totally anti-religion, Jewish, no, no,
that was his background, but never set foot in the synagogue. She had become
Catholic, which he didn’t like, with — all sorts of different fields, different things.
Could argue about everything, and did. But ultimately —
Q: There’s also a lot of wisdom and depth, t — for both to see these things about the
other.
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And that’s all part of being this kind of outsider.
Now, you know, you were outsiders, and then there were occasional little things
which were not. When my mother comes to pick me up the first few day — the first
day or so that I’ve gone to Worthington Hooker, this public school, just a few
blocks from where we were living, she arrives and she sees a whole group of kids
around me, sort of singing something and saying something, and said oh dear,

they’re teasing Guido again. But when she gets near, she hears wh-what they’re
saying is Guido has a girlfriend, Guido has a girlfriend. So she says, he’s okay.
Who was this girl? Well, there was, in my class — I was back in second grade, in
my proper class, a little girl whose father was a philosopher. They were Americans,
but he had studied — taught, whatever, for many years in England, and they’d just
come back from England. And he was now the faculty, and he — his daughter was
a classmate of mine. She struck me immediately as being civilized. She was the
only European, and it was a different way of being. And we became very good
friends, and she then — complicated life, ended up going back to England actually,
and became a great poet. Her name is Anne Stevenson, she’s won all sorts of
prizes.
Q: Rings a bell.
A: She wrote a book about Sylvia Plath, which is controversial and so on. And
we’re in touch with each other. Her sister was in Anne’s class, because they
ultimately went over to this other school as well. And we’ve remained friends. So
there were contacts, that usually had to do with something not exactly Italian, but
European, something. Or there were people — there was a great, old classics
professor, who lived to be a hundred, named heners — Hendrickson. When Anne

and I were engaged, and all sorts of people in the Italian-American community here
were so excited about the fact that this Italian was marrying into this great, great —
Q: Yankee family.
A: — family. Professor Hendrickson came to see my parents, and said — who we’d
become a good friend of, because he was somebody who was — who knew Italy
before the great migrations and so on, and in finding Italians, said to them, oh I’m
very glad, because I want you to know, that this a good family. He, telling — I was a
friend of Anne’s, he said, great-grandfather, who was a professor in the law school
and treasurer of the university, who died in 1906, but this guy knew him, as a
friend of his, and they’re really good people, so I’m glad — so again, this funny,
reverse —
Q: But also very touching.
A: Very touching.
Q: Very, very touching, and — I mean, again, as you’ve been speaking about the
Italian world, and the Italian world, as I keep saying for two millennia, you know,
of your family, and the history, one could make an assumption that some of the
success of the people who were part of your family, 1s built on those who came
before.
A: I suppose.

have to display?
A: I mean, who —
Q: But when you come here, you have none of that.
A: Yeah, who knows? And — and it — my parents did not put pressure on us. I think
that both my brother and I knew very well, that we had to do well, because I think,
when somebody in school asked me, why do you work hard? You’re so bright, you
can do everything easily.
Q: Yeah.
A: Why do you work hard? And I s — I know I said, because I have to be able to be
on my own if anything happens. And so that while my parents protected us
enormously, I think both Paul and I knew that we had to rebuild because we had
this — we were okay, but immensely fragile. Because if anything had happened to
them, it ha — and we saw, you know, also, other people who hadn't be — my father
had been told by his father, it’s very nice you want to study medicine, but
remember, you don’t really need to work for a living. Fortunately, my father
ignored that, and —
Q: Studied medicine.

Interview with Guido Calabresi ms

A: — studied medicine. So when we came, there was something that he could do.
My mother was a learned —
Q: Person.
A: — person, and so could do something. There was another Italian-American-
Jewish family that ended up in New Haven, the time that we were here. Oddly,
because the younger sister of this man’s wife had gotten a fellowship to study at
Yale, just a much younger person, and so these two ended up here. He was of a
family that was extremely wealthy insurance people from Venice. And she was of
good family, not great and so on. She hadn't studied as much as my mother, she
was not that. And he was an insurance man, of a great business family. They came
here. He worked in a factory. She got picked up by this wonderful headmistress of
an elementary school to teach French, so that we all learned French from Madame
[indecipherable] who is this Italian woman, and so on. And that was better
enough. But in a way, people like Paul and me, saw how important it was, if you
were not in a world that knew you. And we didn’t even know of a world that knew
us any more. We didn’t even know. This was the world that we knew, that we
were. And so it — that probably was something that drove us to — well, my parents
never — never said that — you know, the fact of getting good grades and so on, was

something that in my family was always — everybody always had, so that that was
not an issue. That was not —
Q: It — another thought that I had as you’ve been certainly telling me the past of the
Italian branch of the family, is when did you learn these things? It must have been
here, because you were six years old when you left.
A: Oh yes. I learned things here, some from my parents when — when I went back. I
happen to be a person who was always blessed with a great memory, and a very,
sort of broad interest. So that when I went and met relatives there, I would talk to
them about their history, I would hear about them. And all of these things sort of
got learned, some here, some from my brother, who knew things in a somewhat
different way than I did. But more, I think just in talking to my parents, and in
being interested in things in which, to some extent they were not. They were much
less interested in their ancestors, because to them it had come as a matter of course.
Q: Of course.
A: And somehow you were, you know — they were people for whom this whole
ancient history was kind of — you know, a bother. For me it was something that was
kind of interesting to know who I was, in a place where I wasn’t.
Q: Interesting way — well put, you know.

Interview with Guido Calabresi
July 27, 2017
A: You know, and — and so that — that became, and so I’d listened and I took these
things in. And by the way, that’s why I’m in a hurry, I’ve written a draft of this
book. It’s an ugly draft, it’s not well, but I’m almost 85, and how long I’Il last I
don’t know, and I wanted to get it down on paper so that if I don’t get it in shape, at
least it’s there, because I’m the last one who knows these stories.
Q: They’re important stories. They paint — they paint a world, you know.
A: Yes.
Q: And they paint the individual destiny.
A: They paint a world of people who somehow thought that nothing could happen
to them, found themselves in desperate danger, reacted to that in a variety of
different ways, and then find that people, in a variety of different ways and of
different means, saved them.
Q: That’s huge.
A: And that’s remarkable.
Q: Yeah, that’s huge.
A: And that’s remarkable. And — and it is different from different Holocaust tales
of others.
Q: Judge Calabresi, there is so much more that we could talk about.
A: But I think this is a — good.

Q: Yeah.
A: Thank you.
Q: Thank you.
A: And I hope this is useful to the museum, but I —
Q: I think
A: — a part — I just — you know, I’ve loved meeting you two.
Q: Thank you so much, and it’s been mutual. I — we could talk so much about your
postwar career. I will just say now that amongst your students was one of our
former presidents, President Bill Clinton.
A: Yes, yeah.
Q: Who appointed you a second circuit court judge, is that correct?
A: Yes. And he — well, and Hillary, of course. And three people on the Supreme
Court.
Q: Summer — Sonia —
A: Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Sam Alito. And I can tell you
something about their schoolwork.
Q: But that’s not a Holocaust story.
A: That’s not a Holocaust story.
Q: Okay.

Interview with Guido Calabresi

A: But you know, I been — I been extraordinarily lucky, and have had — you know,
I’ve been extraordinarily lucky, or blessed, and God knows why. And in the end,
what I said when I was appointed a judge, that America did do for me, and people
here, all sorts of very, very good things, and it didn’t do it for others. And one of
the things of being a refugee is seeing what was done for you, and who did it, and
trying to do that for others.
Q: Thank you.
A: And in the end, that’s most important.
Q: Thank you very, very much.
A: Thank you.
Q: Okay. Now we’ll say — I have to stop for a second, and I will say that, with this

Judge Guido Calabresi, on July 27", 2017, in New Haven, Connecticut. Thanks
again.
A: Thank you.
Q: All right.
