of 47, because at that time they wanted more younger people in the army. And he
was a graduate of the so-called Russian West Point, with the number one vocation.
And so he ret — he was ret — he re — he retired, and I had a great time with him, he
used to walk in the park, on every Sunday in Kovel where I used to live, before I
was deported. And he always was teaching Jewish university subject, like ROTC.

Q: At a Jewish university?
A: Yeah.
Q: Really?
A: There was a Jewish university in Kovel.

Q: Do you remember what it was called?
A: Not the name itself, no.
Q: So, you say you were born in Lublin.
A: Yeah.
Q: Did you live — did you spend your childhood there?
A: Probably — maybe — I remember when — 19 — 1935, I was still in Krasnik, which
was by Lublin. I was born in Lublin, obviously, in a hospital, but we lived in
Krasnik, where my father was some kind of a official for the Polish army, or so.
Krasnik — so in ’35, we’re still in Krasnik. So probably from ’36, we — we moved
to Kovel.
Q: Mm-hm. And is that far from Lublin?
A: Oh probably, I — maybe couple hundred miles.
Q: Okay. So, within — was it still in the same part of the country, then?

A: Yes.
Q: Okay. And — and what was Kovel, was that a village, or a town?
A: No, that was town, that was town.
Q: Aw — about how many people? Do you know?
A: Offhand, probably 100,000 maybe, about. That I’m not sure of.
Q: Did your sister play a role in your growing up, or had she moved out of the house
when you were born?
A: Well, she — well, she graduated from high school, she moved to Warsaw, she
was studying there. So, I had the very brief relationship with her. And of course,
with the age differential, little brother.
Q: Well, in some ways then, did you grow up as an only child?
A: Yes, I did.
Q: Did your father talk about his military experiences as a young man, to you? Did
he tell you about what his early military career was like?
A: Yes, he was talking that he was a f — go-got first lieutenant when he graduated
from that — I call it the Russian West Point. And then when Bolsheviks took over,
they escaped to Russia. They expec — escape to Poland, and his parents lived there.
Also, he had a brother, so he lived in Kovel, but he was a doctor, so Russians didn’t
bother him.

Q: Okay. I want to go back to the time — the Russian West Point, was that within the
Tsarist empire?
A: Yes.
Q: Was it outside of Poland?
A: Kiev, it was in Kiev.
Q: It was in Kiev.
A: Yeah.
Q: It was in Kiev. So he was at first inducted, or — into the Imperial Tsarist Army?
A: Yes.
Q: And did he fight in that army?
A: I don’t believe that he fought in that army, because he joined — he joined Polish
underground, and so on.
Q: In those — in the — during World War I?
A: Yeah, correct.
Q: And your mother, was she from Lublin as well?
A: My mother, I don’t know exactly where she was born, but probably around
Zytomierz or Kiev, in that area. And — and she was a registered nurse, and of
course, during the — in Poland she didn’t work, because my father is an officer,
made very good salary. As a matter of fact, we had a full time servant, and he had —

January 31, 2015
he — he had — and we had the part time servant, and he had the orderly. Later, dis-
discontinued orderly, but at one time, each officer had a —
Q: Had an orderly.
A: Yeah, that’s right, so —
Q: Okay. How do you say orderly in Polish?
A: Ordynans.
Q: Okay, because another interview that I had this week, somebody was talking
about an ordynans, and they couldn’t think the word in English, and I didn’t know
what it was. And now I know. Thank you. Okay. So, to go back — so your mother
was born in the territory of today’s Ukraine.
A: Yeah.
Q: It if was Zytomierz or Kiev. And your father as well, or —
A: Yes, that’s right.
Q: So they all came from the east, then.
A: Vinnytsia or something like that. As a matter of fact, his parents probably were
deported by — by Stalin, because a lot of people from that area, Vinnytsia,
Zytomierz, Kiev, were deported.
Q: You mean jer — before the world war — world — World War II?
A: Yes.

Q: Okay.
A: In 30s.
Q: In the 30s.
A: In early 30s, they were.
Q: Did he have any communication with his family? Because you were in Poland,
and —
A: Not really, not really, th — the only communication, he was writing the Polish
consulate in — in — in — about — asking about some of his papers, but I don’t — I
didn’t see any postcards from — from his parents, so it, of course, when Bolsheviks
took it over, probably 1-1f you are sending letters, they probably threw it in a round
file. The circle file.
Q: So, did he talk much about his underground activities during World War I?
A: Well, he wasn’t the bragging type, he just mention here and there, and he took
part in a—ina-—inaf-—a fight against the Bolsheviks in 1920, and Poland defeated
them, and —
Q: So he was part of that battle?
A: Yeah.
Q: Okay.

January 31, 2015
A: And he really — in Poland, somehow government didn’t like people who got
education in Tsarist Russia. They rather lean toward the people who were under
Austria or Prussia.
Q: Why?
A: And he was — he was a graduate of the —
Q: Russian West Point.
A: Yes. With the number one —
Q: Certificate?
A: Yes. So — well, like in many politics, there’s no like to — those people were too
smart.
Q: Yeah, that’s true. Do you know the name of this military academy that was in
Russia?
A: Not really. Probably Kiev military academy or something. I probably could dig
out from — from some of the papers that I have here, because at one time I was
thinking about getting a lawyer and trying to — because my grandparents had a big,
big, big landowners they were, around Vinnytsia. And one of the guy from Serbian
society, he went to Ukraine about five, 10 years ago, and they paid him for his
house which he had over there. Except he couldn’t take money fr-from Ukraine, so
he got to leave it to his aunt, or something.

Q: So you’re thinking about reparations, about you some —
A: But you know, it’s getting late. I’m 85 now. Another month I’Il be 86, so —
Q: Well, congratulations, happy birthday. You — so your grandparents were
landowners?
A: Yes.
Q: And they had two sons, your father and his brother?
A: Yes.
Q: And so did both of them finish higher education?
A: Oh, the one was the doctor, so evidently he —
Q: Yeah.
A: — and he had to finish it in — in Russia, yeah. And ri —
Q: And did they have girls? I’m sorry, I interrupted you. You — I — were they the
only two boys, or were there more children in that family?
A: That’s what I am aware of, because I haven’t discuss it with my father, but I
know for sure that him and his brother, because he lived in same town. And when
the Russians came, he didn’t visit us be — for the obvious reasons.
Q: Of course, of course. Tell me a little bit about your mother’s family. Were they
also landowners?

January 31, 2015
A: That — I don’t know too much about my mother’s family, but evidently they were
well-to-do, because she — she graduated as a registered nurse. At the time it was like
at the university, at that level. So evidently, you — they could afford to send her, you
know, to — for her education. So evidently they were doing okay.
Q: And was her family also in this Vinnytsia - Kiev area?
A: Evidently so, because you know, when the — my father and they met, so that they
had to be someplace in the area.
Q: Which — which to me suggests that — did you know any of her family members?
It sounds like you didn — you wouldn’t have had the chance to do so.
A: No, there was a elderly woman that used to live with us. She was a part of my
mother’s family, but I don’t know what was her relationship to — to my grandparents
there. But she lived with us, about 95 when she died.
Q: I see. Okay. But this is also unusual for the people that I’ve talked to, that so
much of your parents’ families were on the other side of the border. And that that
border was closed, you know, during the 1920s, and the 1930s. Most people had
their families around them. The larger families. Did you — before World War II, did
you visit with your doctor uncle much? Did you see each other often?
A: Oh yes, they used to come over to our house, we used to go to their house. And
by the way, we were doing much better to hear that he’s a doctor.

every couple months, yeah.

A: No, they didn’t. They didn’t have.

A: Yes, 30 — °39 — °38 - 39, yeah.

good, so she came over to Kovel. And she was in Kovel on the 29" of August. And
my father was begging her, says, listen, stay here. War is going to break out any
time. She says, they need me over there, I belong to many organizations there,
they’re going to need me there, and she went back to Warsaw.
Q: I see. And then what happened to her?

Q: I’m talking after the war, when — did you find out her story? Did you find out
about her story?
A: Well, we were looking for her through Red Cross and everything, and Warsaw
was destroyed 80 percent. But finally we found her, and she lived in the same house
what she did before the war.
Q: My goodness.
A: In Zoliborz. Zoliborz wasn’t destroyed that much. So she lived there, and she
was working in the bank at that time, under — under communist Poland, she worked
the bank.
Q: And when you — okay, when you found her, what year was that?
A: Probably it was °47.

Did you ever find out details about her story, her life?
A: Well, she didn’t talk much about her conc — life in concentration camp, but she
said it was tough, and — and of course, then she was working in a bank, as a clerk,
because being the daughter of an officer, this new ga — new — new so-called Polish
government, did — didn’t look at those people —
Q: Very favorably.
A: Very favorably, right.
Q: Which concentration camp was she in?
A: I—I really don’t know.
Q: You don’t know.
A: No.
Q: Okay.

just — after she died, I didn’t want to read those letters.

something, but it was too late.
Q: Oh. And your uncle, you say he was also in a concentration camp?
A: Yes, then he came back to Poland, br — as a matter of fact, she was buried at
Pouwonski(ph).
Q: Your sister?
A: Yeah. And I’m sure that right now it’s probably cost 10,000 dollars, the plot over
there. But I’m sure during that — in 50s it was still — so he buried her there, so —
Q: Your uncle took care of that?
A: Yeah. And he wrote me couple times, and then asked me, why don’t you come
back? And I wrote him back, I said, listen, I don’t want to come back to a country
which killed my father. And so then I got the reply, he said, those letters with
English stamps do me lot of harm. So our correspondence stopped at that.
Q: Oh dear, oh dear. Were you able to find out more about what his life had been
under German occupation?
A: No, not really.
Q: And so you wouldn’t know what concentration camp he was in.

A: No, I wouldn’t know. But at — the letters did say that they were in a — in a cattle
car, something like that, like we to Siberia. And sometimes they were standing in
the water up to their ankles, and stuff like that. So there were some horror stories
about his life.
Q: And it’s also — I mean, that is a tragedy, but it is also a tragedy that you could
never meet and talk about these things. That you — that — that you were so separated,
and you couldn’t correspond.
A: Well, of course, back in 50 s — ’53, like any young man, 1s not interested in those
things. I mean, I was always patriot, stuff like that, but you know, young people,
they have different — for example, even here in — I jo-joined the Siberian society
about 25 years ago. Before that 1t was playing cards; bridge, poker, stuff like that, so
Q: You were enjoying your life.

your father earned quite good money, or must have had a very good pension, if he
retired from the military, so that you had both a maid, and other household help, and
he had an orderly.
A: Correct.
Q: Okay. Can you describe your home to me, in Kovel?
A: Well, we never owned the house. We always —

the cemetery, visit this aunt - my — my mother’s aunt, I believe, that, you know, she
died when she was about 95. And — and —

Q: Did you have conversations with him as you were taking these walks?
A: Oh yes, we were talking about different things, but he never — never talk about
his military service, and stuff like that. He would say oh look, they building a new
park here, and I used to enjoy it, even as a little boy, I say well, that town is going
someplace. And —
Q: Did you spend as much time with your mother, as with your father?
A: Probably yes, yes, with my mother. Both of them were pretty strict.
Q: Really?
A: Yeah.
Q: Tell me about that. Tell me about that.
A: Well, for example, I didn’t go to the first grade, my father was tutoring me. That
wasn’t the —
Q: It wasn’t fun, huh?
A: — best year of my life. And my mother, she was strict, but [indecipherable] for
something, if 1t was reason — reason, she would say okay. And my father was, when
he was at home, he was engrossed in his books about military, even though he was
retired, and he was a big stamp collector, and this type of a thing. And as I said, it
was — it was pretty nice.
Q: What was — why was it that you didn’t go to first grade?

Interview with Eugene Chmielowski “
January 31, 2015
A: Well, my father says, why you should go with all these people there, where you
can do it at home?
Q: Right.
A: As a matter of fact, I only went to second and third grade. And then not — from
that, I jumped to the high school. Wasn’t easy.
Q: I can believe it. I can believe it. So, which of your parents did you feel closer to?
A: Probably mother, as is usually.
Q: Mm-hm. And — and what kind of a personality did she have?
A: Oh well, if my father had the personality of my mother, he would be general.
Q: Really?
A: Oh, she was tough. Sometimes, she was sick, had the heart condition and so on,
and s-some — my father had the military doctor, so — but you know those military
doctors, they didn’t think much of them. So he used to go to private doctor, even
though, you know, uncle was a doctor, but he didn’t go to him. So sometimes a guy
would come and say something bad to my mother, my mother says, get out of this
house, yeah.
Q: She didn’t like the diagnosis.
A: No. So later I will tell you how she was handling KGB, and k — NKVD at that
time.

fluent Polish, so —
Q: Multilingual.
A: Yeah, multilingual.
Q: Were you studying any of these languages as a little boy?
A: Well, I— I— when I went to — to high school, I took English, because at that time
you need only one modern language. When my sister went to school, she needed
two classical languages, was Greek and Latin, and two modern languages, which
was French and a —
Q: And Polish.
A: — and German.

A: Because English wasn’t very popular, before the war, in Poland —
Q: Yeah.
A: — just now, so yeah.
Q: Then —
A: My mother, later she was working as interpreter, so I was talking to a woman,
and sh-she said well, she speaks German like she just came from Berlin, and she
didn’t use the language for 25 years.
Q: Wow, that shows a talent.
A: Yeah.
Q: A — areal facility for a language.
A: And she spoke three languages, and later she tried to learn English, when we
were in India. And some people here, they come and they spend here 40 years, and
they don’t even learn English.
Q: And she learned it there?
A: She had a rough time with it, I’m sure [indecipherable] 50, so that’s —

January 31, 2015
A: Well, as I read some of the opinions of his superiors, that he was pretty
easygoing, but di-didn’t have much confidence
Q: In himself?
A: — even though — even though he had, you know, good education, and so on. But
he wasn’t pushy, let’s put it this way. And he — like in any — in any area, you have to
be pushy, to really succeed.
Q: And did you sense that from how you knew him, that he was more reserved —
A: Exactly.
Q: — he was more — okay.
A: Yes.
Q: A quieter person?
A: Yes, that’s right.
Q: Did you feel that you were close to both of them, though? Were you a close-knit
family, or —

Q: Yeah. And what did the doctor say, do you remember?
A: Oh, he says, oh, I’m going to discipline him.
Q: Did he treat you, for whatever wounds you —
A: No, the —
Q: No.
A: It wasn’t big wound, just a scratch.
Q: Just a scratch. Were your parents very religious, or not so much?
A: Not so much. They — th-they believe in God, but my mother very seldom used to
go to church, and — and my father, right before the war, I think, he went to — to
confession, and so on. And of course my mother was running the orphanage, and she
was running the home for the old people.
Q: This is before the war?
A: Yeah, before the war. So she says oh, that counts more than going to mass every
Sunday.
Q: She had a point. She had a point. So she was involved in such activities?

conversations?
A: Well, of course they were talking about Bolsheviks, how bad they were, and so
on. But as far as Germany, England, I don’t think they discuss it ver-very much. Of
course, my father thought that after 20 years, the Bolsheviks became more human.
As it turned out, they weren’t.

border, this plane is doing this, and the Warsaw is bombed, and other towns are
bombed, and so on. So it’s a—
Q: How did — how — what was — when your parents heard this, and when people in
the — in Kovel heard this, how — how were people behaving? How were they
reacting to this news?
A: Well, I think they took it in stride. For example, we — we lived — we lived close to
downtown, and on one occasion we went to the — where there was a army
headquarters, and they have a army mess over there, and we went there for lunch,
with my father, mother. And as we were having lunch, all of a sudden the planes
came over. You could see the faces of the pilots, and one of the lieutenants says, oh,
those are Polish, because they got Polish insignia on the planes.
Q: Did they really?
A: They did. And as he said they are Polish, they started shooting. So we went — run
away from the building, and there were some planes over there, so we hid in there.
So that was like probably third and fourth of September.
Q: Amazing that they were so close you could see the faces.

arrive, what were people doing? What was happening in Kovel?
A: Well, they were going to work, and I think schools were closed, because they
made the hospital with those schools. So — and I was going to go to the fourth grade,
but never happened. And —
Q: By the way, were there Jewish people in Kovel?

she was running that orphanage, so she needed some funds. So they — they were —
Q: Supporting it.
A: Of course, where we lived, the owner of this house was Jew, too, and — and I was
talking with his son. His son was six, seven years older, and I was telling him that
we going to beat Germans, and this guy says, no way, they’re too strong. Of course,
he was 15, or something.
Q: So, two military experts having a conversation.
A: Exactly, yes.
Q: So, people still continued going to work, even though there was no school. What

—my mother, father, and myself, except for that trip that we made to that military
mess over there. Cassino(ph), you could call it cassino(ph), really. So, I never

Q: Did you — okay, did you do any preparations? Did you expect the Germans to
arrive at some point?
A: Well, we as a military family were given the gas masks, because at that time
everybody was expecting the day going to — to gas, but never happened. So we — we
— we received the masks, those high — high tech masks that — because the old ones,
you could choke in them. The new ones, they were really comfortable, but we never
use them. And later we cut them to pieces because they didn’t want Russians to take
them over.
Q: Okay. So how do things progress throughout September? What happens?
A: Well, September 17", Russians entered Poland. And they were marching. And
we — we lived in that house, and by that house there was a water pump. And as they
were marching, this soldier — I was outside — came by me. Says, can you give me a
cup, because I want to get some water. So to was — ma — my first interaction with the

on the 18" of September.

A: Well, it was the second day of Easter, in 1940.
Q: So it’s the se — it’s half a year later.
A: It was probably March.
Q: Okay.
A: Knock on the door, it’s three — three en - NK VD guys enter, and there was one
civilian, who sort of sided with Russians. He was a Polish citizen. So they — we had
the big radio. So they took that radio, they say it’s no way private person could have
a radio like that, it had to belong to the government. And then he — had the leather —
leather briefcase, they took that one too, and they took him away, and told my
mother that he’ ll be released in — in couple days, which of course, never happened.
Q: Did they say why they were arresting him?
A: No, they arrested all the officers, all the officers —
Q: So, was he expecting this to happen?
A: Well, probably. But he had the chance to go to Romania, that — that was still
when the war was on, because the — the people were going — from part of the
government, they were going through Romania. So they stopped and they say to
him, listen, let’s go with us, we go to Romania. And my father says no, I got to take

survive. That was still in the — September, of course, that he had the chance to go to
Romania.
Q: Do you think he fully — do you think he expected he’d be back in a few days, like
they said?
A: Ah, probably not. My — my mother went to the NK VD, and says, where are they
going to process him, and so forth. And she says, where is the radio? Oh, you’ll get
it back eventually. Didn’t care about the radio, she cared about him.
Q: Yeah.
A: And — but they made her offer. They said, we are going to release him right
away, if you’re going to give us some information about lot of people in this town.
And of course my mother turned them down, for two reasons. She was really
patriotic. Second is she knew that they were lying. So, she didn’t pick up it.
Q: How long did this take, when they came to your home, and they banged on the
door? Was it a half hour, an hour, sa — all day?
A: Oh, at least hour and a half probably. They were searching the house for — for
guns, some reason. Suddenly that’s a — most hour and a half, yeah.

Q: Okay.
A: And so, half an hour, and pack. My mother started arguing with those people,
with those NKVDs. Probably Germans would shot her on the spot because she was
telling them that Stalin gived his own mother, and so on. And I started to pack, and
this NK VD man was helping me packing, because my mother didn’t pack.

Q: That means something, yes.

in 1940, in December. She says that she — she — she passed the parcel to — to my
father, and at that time, he wasn’t there. So evidently those — those prison officials
took the parcel and told her he is there, but I’m sure he wasn’t there, because it was
December of 1940.

— but all my life I have everything took in stride, because I figured well, it’s not
going to help me if I am going to despair and stuff like that. Is going to make things
worse. So, I was on the train, doing nothing, like most of the people. They were
singing, and so on.

them that I don’t have shoes, and the board of education says they don’t have in the
budget money f— to buy stuff for the shoes. So I wasn’t going to school, which was
a big mistake, because I could learn s-something. Th-Th — they had a good level
math in Russian schools, and of course I learned Russians at home, because lot of
those Russians officers came to Poland after Bolshevik revolution. As a matter of
fact, we lived block and a half for Gagarina, who was a princess. They said that
