So shortly after bri \u2014 getting back to Warsaw, her economical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just present herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a Christian lady who was married to a policeman, also Polish. And she says, well, if you refuse to help me, I understand. It\u2019s a big risk. But 1f you can\u2019t, I have no one to call any more, you know. So \u2014 and she, she did so. She said, wait.
