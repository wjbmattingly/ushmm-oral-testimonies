Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 4
A: That was in Galicia. However, it has changed borders and, and rulers constantly.

very savvy on the internet found it.

Q: The places in that part of the world can have five spellings for a small town, a small
place, five different languages. Did your father ever speak of it?

called it Poland. And so my passport said Poland.
Q: Because you had your citizenship based on your father’s birth.
A: Correct.

that was, that was a goal of his to go to Krakow.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 6
A: He was the oldest and he had quite a few sisters and brothers. And his father was a
carpenter who quickly brought him into the business. And so he learned carpentry from
knee high up and he became a carpenter, which served him very well throughout his life.
Q: Yes, it’s one of those types of skills that is transferrable. A lawyer may not be able to
be a lawyer in every country, but a carpenter, that’s different.
A: And it gave him sort of a privileged position during the First World War when his
commanding officer recognized his talent and sort of kept him close by to feather his love
nest basically. And so he, he made things for this--
Q: Commanding officer
A: Commanding officer. And stayed safe.
Q: One thing I didn’t ask was which army did he serve with. That’s also not a done deal.
A: Right. It must have been the Kaiser’s army.
Q: It would have been the German depression army?
A: Correct.

Austro-Hungary, to Prussia and to Russia and when your father was born, he was born in
one of those three places. Whether it was the Russian part--
A: I think it was Austria, Austria. Yes.
Q: So then it probably was the Austrian army.
A: Army. Correct. Yeah. He spoke German so.
Q: Well both places, Prussia and Austro-Hungary.
A: Well they were on the same side.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 8
A: Well they were, you know, in a small town and the, everybody watched everybody
else and made sure that you were doing the right thing. That you were going to cheder,
you were observing the holidays. And of course it was a very kosher home. And that’s,
that was you know all he knew. When his father died suddenly, he was 14 years old.
Q: Oh he was very young.
A: He was very young and he became the head of the house.
Q: That’s a huge burden for a young boy.
A: It was and he never got, he never quite got over it. I mean I think the man was a
genius.
Q: Your father.
A: Yes. And the older I get, the more I can relate to what he went through, but he was
very stern. And he had all these kids to take care of. And his mother. To take care of.
And he did it, he did.

kids. He had learned the carpentry trade from his own father, during those first few years

A: Exactly. Exactly.
Q: Did you ever know any of your aunts and uncles, his brothers and sisters?
A: I, I knew two of them. There was a hard feelings in that family. Very, very hard
feelings. And so there was a rift and I did not really get to know them. I know of them but
I did not have a direct experience with them.
Q: You say when you know two of them, you know of two of them, rather than having
met them?

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 10
A: I think we did meet them. In fact one of my father’s sisters came to meet the boat
when we arrived.
Q: Oh I see, so she had already been to the United States. She was already in America.
A: Correct, yes. My grandmother’s, his, my father’s mother, Chia Rivka Goldberg had a
large extended family and some of them had emigrated to the United States. Probably
before the First World War. And so there was a family on this side of the ocean yes.
And they were the ones who provided the first visas for our family.
Q: We’ll come to that. Now what did your father tell you about his own parents, his own,
what kind of people they were and things like that.
A: He didn’t really talk about them too much. As I say, by the time he was talking to me
there was this rift.
Q: Do you know what it was due to?
A: It was a lack of appreciation for what he had done for them. It was a lack of
acknowledgment and he just couldn’t get over that. So he just turned his back on them.
It was very painful.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 11
Q: I can imagine or I can’t imagine actually.
A: Well it meant that you know we didn’t have any supportive family around.
Q: And that means in Vienna?
A: No, this was in the United States. In Vienna, his mother had her own apartment,
which my father supported.
Q: So you knew your grandmother?
A: A little bit, yeah. Yeah.
Q: Do you have any memories of her?
A: Just that she was very tiny. Very tiny and she didn’t speak German. She spoke
Yiddish and we didn’t have much, much contact. Yeah.
Q: What about religion? Was he brought up in a very orthodox family? Or?

http://collections.ushmm.org

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 12
A: I don’t think they were you know really committed to orthodoxy but the trappings of
orthodoxy. Kosher home and food and observation of major holidays. I don’t think the,
the real ethnic deepness of the Jewish religion was something that they actually felt
connected to.
Q: Even your grandparents’ generation?
A: I think I think it was just —
Q: Tradition.
A: Yes, just the trappings of it. I don’t think they were intellectually rooted in Judaism.
Q: Did the children that means your father and his siblings, what kind of schooling did
they get?
A: My fa, well as I said my father left school by the time he was 14. And he was very
frustrated with the schooling because it was German one day and then they’d come back
from a vacation and they, everything was in Polish. Then everything was in Russian.
And he just lost patience with the whole thing. He just said to heck with it.
Q: Well that’s what happens when borders change.

http://collections.ushmm.org

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 13
A: He just, it was too frustrating.
Q: Now your mother, let’s turn to her side of the family. Where was your mother from?
A: My mother was born in Vienna.
Q: And what was her maiden name?
A: Her maiden name was Zehngut, which means ten times good. And her parents were
Austrian. Her father was a photographer and a inventor. He invented a washing machine
and he invented all kinds of useful things but he never made money. He never made
money at that.
Q: Sometimes it’s not the inventors who do. It’s the people who take their ideas and
market them.
A: Right and there were no patents and everything. But he was a very kindly person, very
generous and very nice.
Q: Do you remember him’?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection
Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 14
A: Barely, barely. I remember my mother’s impressions of him where he was very gentle
and very kind to the girls. She had two sisters and she was the youngest. And her mother
was, her maiden name was, the mother’s maiden name was Ernestina Deutch.
Q: Ernestine German.
A: Yes. And she had several siblings whom I knew. And she actually was the
breadwinner of the family and she did sewing which many of the women did in those
days, because everything was hand made. Clothing was hand made. And so she
supported the family. And she was you know she had a tough job. She had a tough job.
Q: At a time when that wasn’t acknowledged so easily or almost at all by society that
women were supporting families, more than men were. Some of them ended up in such a
predicament. Was your maternal side of the family well to do or struggling do you think?
A: I think they were struggling. I think they were struggling to be middle class. But they
valued culture. They loved to go to the opera and dances and beautiful clothes and
Vienna was sort of a, I don’t know, high class place like Paris and New York.
Q: Before the Austro-Hungarian empire fell 1t certainly was.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 15
A: Yes, yes. and the trappings are still there. The Baroque buildings and the opera and
museums and that’s still there. And the art and the music. Very, very proud of it, the
Austrians. Especially the Viennese.
Q: Do you know much about your mother’s side of the family, if they had been Viennese
for generations. Or whether they had come from someplace else?
A: Well with the name of Deutch. I would guess that maybe they were sort of more from
Germany and her father, Zehngut, had a branch of the family that was in Eisenstaedt,
which is, well it was the mining area, probably more to the east. So there is some
relationship there. So it was Austria.
Q: Within those lands, within the German speaking lands--
A: Exactly, exactly. And the Austrian empire, the Hungarian empire was quite extensive.
Q: What was your mother’s first name?
A: Stella.
Q: Stella. And so her maiden name was Stella, she was Stella Zehngut.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 16
A: Correct.
Q: Do you know how your parents met?
A: I do not, I do not.
Q: Were they very different as people?
A: I think so. I think they were, I think my mother was very proud of her Austrian
heritage and sort of lauded it over my father who was, who was the country bumpkin.
Q: Well you know I didn’t want to ask it quite like that but these are different worlds.
The world of Vienna even if you are let’s say in a lower middle class and the world of the
town I can’t pronounce.
A: Knihynicze.
Q: Knihynicze, the world of Knihynicze are two different ones and you know when
they’re blended you know how do they mix.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 17
A: Yeah, yeah there was always that tension. Yeah but you know she recognized that he
always earned a good living and that he was very reliable and very dependable but had
rough edges.
Q: What were their personalities like as people, your parents.
A: Well my father loved to work. He really liked his work and he knew that he had
ability. He could look at something and make it. He could design something new and
did. I have some of his furniture that he made for me. Yes. Made here in the United
States. So he was, he was really, I think he was a genius. If he had, had any schooling he
would have god knows where he would have been. But and my mother was very, you’d
have to call it shtultz, she was very proud. And snooty. Kind of snooty. I have to say
that. Yeah and so she always liked pretty things and made sure that her girls had pretty
things. And that sort of thing. But she was a very strong woman. I mean she, she was the
one who signed us up to come to America. My father was in Knihynicze taking care of
things there. He was out of town at the time. And she signed us up. When he came home
it was fait accompli.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: Yeah. He went crazy.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 18
Q: I can imagine. You know one parent taking you know the decision on the children.
And such a decision. We’ll come to that. But this sets the scene, this really does. And
what about as parents. Was there one parent that you were closer to than the other?
A: Well I think children are especially girls are close to their mothers. And it’s only later
that they discover that their fathers are people too. My father seemed brusque and he was
very powerfully built so he was a little scary.
Q: Was he a handsome man’?
A: I think so yes. They were both handsome people. So yeah.
Q: For a little girl--
A: He was tough. He was yeah, I sort of [pushes hands away]
Q: Were your parents strong disciplinarians?
A: Well they were very protective. For girls. Very protective. But we were such good
girls. We didn’t do anything. We were such good girls. We were so—

A: --And nice, yes. I don’t know where that came from. But I made up for it. (laughs)
Q: The second part of one’s life one undoes the first part.
A: Probably. [wipes mouth]
Q: What do you remember from home, from your home in Vienna. Can you tell me what
it looked like?
A: We had an apartment in Vienna. I believe it was on the second floor. And it was on
Rohdenstern Gasse.
Q: Rohdenstern Gasse.
A: Rohdenstern Gasse.
Q: Red star street. Alley, actually.
A: And I remember that each room had a ceramic heater.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 20
A: Exactly.
Q: Those used to be huge.
A: They, each room had its own heating. You know Vienna being in Central Europe was
quite chilly so yes, and it was heated with coals. The furniture, my father made every
stitch.
Q: Really. Everything that you had —
A: Everything yes.
Q: Did he have a workshop nearby.
A: Yes. I don’t know the address of it. But it was nearby. And it was a Jewish
neighborhood. And it was not fancy. I mean we didn’t have the furniture that we have
today. We did not entertain at home. And my children puzzled about that. That I don’t’
entertain. They said didn’t you entertain in Vienna. No. People met in cafes. They did
not, it was only family that came home. And had you know —

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 21
Q: Oh, so that’s like Manhattan. In Manhattan people don’t have space to entertain so
they meet in restaurants.
A: Well they meet in restaurants, but this was you know this predates that by quite a bit.
It was the home was for the family.
Q: So it was more than just space. It was a tradition, it was a way—
A: It was yes and, and it was around the dining room table and meals that one had
entertainment with the family. So there was not the easy chair kind of sitting area. There
were bedrooms and there was probably like a big common area. I don’t remember the
kitchen at all. I probably was not permitted to go into the kitchen. We did have a maid.
Because there was so much you know in terms of coal and, and laundry and cooking that
unless you were very poor, you had a maid.
Q: It was far more prevalent in Europe —
A: Yes. it was not unusual. You know it was not the status thing that we have. It was a
necessity. And the maid very often would be a young woman from the country who was
looking for opportunities to meet a nice young man, somebody that wouldn’t be in her
home town.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 22
Q: Everybody wanted to get away from all those eyes.
A: Yes, yes. Totally understandable. But I do remember that the we had Christmas for
the maid and I would hang up a stocking and I would get a hunk of coal in the, in the toe,
just to keep me humble. And oranges. And it was not a matter of toys so much but it was
just you know little things. But I do remember the hunk of coal which was supposed to be
if you were a bad girl.
Q: And you weren’t.
A: NO. Let’s see what else. I do, well when, when things got bad, after Kristallnacht
which was 1938, which I do remember. And so pretty soon the maid said that she
couldn’t’ work for a Jewish family. Her boyfriend was a Nazi. And so the maid left.
Q: And that was a real change.
A: It was, it was. We really liked her.
Q: What was her name?
A: Erica.

Q: Did your mother take in sewing like your grandmother did?
A: No. No she did not have to do that.
Q: Was her role basically running the household?
A: Exactly. She was running the household and taking my sister to school. And then
when things got bad and she was trying to figure out what to do, of course my father was
working. Working, working. She was figuring out what to do. She left us alone. My
sister went to school. Now I can’t imagine that I was totally alone in the apartment, but I
would paint. I was you know I was painting and drawing from the time I could hold a
pencil. And so I was busy with my own things that I was doing.
Q: And this was on paper not like on the walls or anything like that?
A: No, no, no. This was on paper with water colors and colored pencils.
Q: I painted on the walls.
A: No I wouldn’t think of that. Oh my goodness. You were a free spirit.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 25
A: Yes. one of those big curvy jobs, yes. And my father listened intently in the evening
to the radio.
Q: Was it music or was it news or was it—
A: Oh he wanted only the news. But there was, there was music too, yes.
Q: At the workshop where he worked, was he self-employed and the only person?
A: He was, no he hired. He had people working for him and one worker in particular was
he probably had been with him for years. And he actually warned us of Kristallnacht
and warned that we were not to open the door, no matter what. And when the storm
troopers and the Black Shirts came and knocked on the door, and banged and called for
my father to come out, he did not. He would have been sent off to Buchenwald or god
knows what.
Q: So I just want to make sure. Can you tell me the name of that worker who warned
your father. Did you know him?
A: I can’t come up with a name now. I, I guess I didn’t, I didn’t’ really go to the shop.
Q: Did any of them ever come to your home, any of those workers.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 26
A: No. No.
Q: But was your father friendly with them?
A: I guess so. I mean I guess he was a good employer. He, he was very short with
people. They had to, he had few people. In the United States he never kept a worker.
They just didn’t do it right or you know he didn’t’ have the patience to teach yeah.
Q: But there he is, this person felt this obligation.
A: Right. Kristallnacht in Germany had preceded the one in Austria.
Q: So what was the date for —
A: It was November tenth, 1938.
Q: I believe it was the day earlier.
A: In Germany, yes, yes. And so he got wind of it and warned my father.
Q: Did you father ever speak of that in later years.

A: Not really, no.
Q: Do you remember the banging —
A: Oh yes, oh yes. We were all in one bed.
Q: Were you really?
A: Yeah. But and my, you know the idea was to be hushed and not make a peep, not
breathe. And so they went away and they came back and they banged and yelled again.
But at that time they didn’t break in. They didn’t break in. They just expected
cooperation.
Q: You said you lived in a Jewish neighborhood.
A: Yes.
Q: So that would have been a target area?
A: Oh for sure.

Q: What did you see?
A: A lot of broken glass. Store fronts had been smashed. And I don’t remember, I know
that they broke into the synagogues and set fires and, and the police and the fire
department just watched and let it happen. And the next day they got old men with beards
to clean it up on their knees.
Q: You saw that.
A: To clean up the streets with buckets of water.
Q: Did your father go to work the following day?
A: I believe so.

afterwards. Did you hear of people who had been picked up, men from families and sent
to Buchenwald.

Although, you know intellectuals and, and people who were prominent were rounded up.
Had been you know it was an ongoing process.
Q: I jumped ahead of myself a little bit. I want to go back to the smaller world without
the politics in it. You say and I’m going to repeat a little bit. Your father was at the
workshop. He hired workers. As subcontractors do you think or as permanent workers.
A: Oh as permanent workers. Yes, everything was done by hand. You know there
probably was an electric saw or something like that but everything was done, measured
and cut and —

A: Not in Vienna, no.
Q: Ok, only here. Your mother ran the household and you had a maid named Erica who
stayed with you until her boyfriend, whom she did find having left the village.

A: My father sort of as I said, he listened to the radio and, and my mother read the
newspapers. And he said you know Hitler was a menace and that he was going to go after
England which was you know out of the blue. Nobody really thought that that would ever
happen. That he, he really he’s going to go after England. My mother read the paper.
And my mother socialized in the cafes. And there was an exchange of information. I
mean that’s all they, they really talked about was you know the oncoming menace and

that was in New York. We wrote to them. —
Q: You mean your father’s side of the family.
A: Correct. She wrote to them and asked for visas. For the family.
Q: Did they supply them? Did the New York relatives supply them.
A: Well I think they wrote back that they were not wealthy and that they would send the
visa for my father. And that as soon as he became established he would bring family.
And that’s the way it had been done previously.
Q: It’s true. In the first wave of immigration that often is what happened. One family
member came over and then brought the rest. But who knew that this was not going to be
that kind of situation ---
A: Exactly, exactly. So they sent papers, visa and their, immigration was tight. Visas
were allocated according to strict quotas and so they sent visas for my father, and I
believe for his brother.
Q: Was his brother in Vienna as well?

apartment.
Q: So when you father had turned his back on the family, it wasn’t to his mother.
A: It was much later.
Q: Oh that was much later.
A: It was state side, state side. No he supported his family through thick and thin. And so
they sent those visas and not for my mother and not for my sister and me. And so my
mother, as I said, was constantly reading the newspapers and talking to people and
hearing what how everybody was trying to get away. and she came across this article in
the paper that this family was coming. And they were going to bring 50 children out of
Vienna.
Q: This must have been a Jewish newspaper. Was it?
A: I don’t know. I, my mother did not read Hebrew.

Q: No, no but I mean a German speaking or maybe there weren’t any by that point.
Because I can’t imagine that in an Austrian newspaper such a thing would have been
published.
A: I think it might have been a little ad something like that.
Q: Maybe something innocuous.
A: Yeah. They were the Krauses were below the radar. They were very, they did not
call attention to themselves either in Vienna or when they got to the United States. It was

A: No. No. And after the war my mother sent for Annie to come to the United States.

A: I remember going to pick up my sister at school, with my mother. We walked together
at the end of the day and there were other mothers standing outside and jeering and
yelling about the Jewish children so [waves hand] I don’t know what they were. But they
it was horrible. And these were mothers, jeering at the Jewish children coming out of
school. They had separated the, you couldn’t go to a regular school. They were now into
Jewish schools.
Q: So this was jeering in front of the Jewish school?
A: Probably, yeah. that’s where she went. And so pretty soon she didn’t continue going
to school.
Q: Did she talk, did Inge talk at all about what school life would have been like? You
know what she ex, cause you were little and you hadn’t yet gone and it’s a —

could rescue. Or what they had taken at that time.
Q: Was this a one-time visit or was this something that he did on a regular basis?

To settle things.
Q: And it’s during this time that your mother finds out something, sees this ad.
A: Correct.
Q: And what happens then?
A: Well she inquired about it. And she said count me in. Take my girls, take my girls to
America. And the hope was that when my father’s family saw how desperate they were,
by sending the girls away alone, that they would send the visa for her, which indeed 1s
what happened. She, they did send the visa. They saw that we were, did not have horns,
that we were normal healthy girls and my sister’s job was to beg them to send that last

ever but you know that they, that was her task, one to look after me. And two, to
convince them and she only had like one little visit to send the papers for my mother.
Q: In what ways would you say your sister didn’t’ get over it? How did it show itself?
A: I think she always felt that she had extra responsibility and that I got a free pass,
which there is some truth to that.
Q: in some ways it’s an echo of your father having had too many burdens.
A: Exactly, exactly.
Q: But it is a huge, you know had it not worked and it would never have been anything of
your sister’s fault because she’s a child, the kind of burden that was on her should she
fail, is huge. So do you remember saying goodby to your mother? And your father?
A: I remember the fight when my father came home yelling and screaming and carrying
on. What have you done? You must be crazy, insane to send your children away. But he
already had the visa and he already was secure. And she was desperate, absolutely
desperate. This was her last chance and our last chance.

uniform came up and as I said I was a cute kid. Came up and he said, started talking to
me. And he said are you Catholische. Ist du Catholische? And I said no, I’m Polish.
Q: That must have gone over well.
A: He was flabbergasted is all I know and he didn’t say another word. Turned on his heel

Q: Being Polish or being Jewish Polish —
A: Well Polish was synonymous at that time with being Jewish.
Q: In Vienna?
A: Yes. My little passport said Polish. Not Austrian. Polish. That was like a code word.

home. So we were at this Jewish c, some kind of Jewish organization or building. And

street. Marching and music and parade and, and so my sister jumped down from her
upper bunk and came into my bed. And then we peaked out the window and we thought it
was Hitler. And we watched and saw this you know all this uniforms and flags and it
was very frightening. It turned out it was a kind of the solidifying the relationship
between Germany and Italy. Von Ribbentrop was representing the German Reich and
Mussolini’s son in law, Chiano , was representing the Italians and this was their
allegiance, their alliance being cemented in with great pomp. As we watched it.
Q: How did you trace that back because as a five year old you wouldn’t know.
A: No, I thought it was Hitler from all the pomp that was happening and the marching
and the uniforms and the flags. Subsequently from Pressman, Steven Pressman’s book
and his research filled in the details.
Q: Isn’t it interesting when you see dots that connect things that you yourself have seen.
A: It was wonderful to fill in the spaces because I just had a generalized impression of
what was going on.

explored and we found first class playroom with fabulous rocking horses and FAO
Schwarz toys. I mean we weren’t supposed to be there. But there were no other children
there at the time. so maybe there were no other children on the ship besides these. And
so we availed ourselves of that fabulous playroom. And as far as I remember, we did not
like the food. It was not familiar. But we did find a barrel of apples and we ate those.

A: No, I was receptive to it all. You know it was all new and it was ok. I didn’t’ have
any great expectations or disappointments you know. A lot of the members of this Jewish
organization the Brith Shalom of Philadelphia took an interest in the children and came to
visit us. And they brought you know they were business people. Some brought hats that
they had in their shop. Or they brought cakes. They, they befriended us and visited us.
And I made particular friends with somebody who had the ability to throw his voice. He
was like a ventriloquist. And I just thought that was the most fabulous talent and we just
had a great time together.
Q: So this is one of the visitors.
A: Yes.
Q: He kept you entertained.
A: He did, he did and he came you know regularly more than once. And I don’t know
whether he thought he would adopt us or what.

Q: Was she as carefree as you were?
A: Probably not. Probably not.
Q: In general was she a serious personality?
A: Oh yes, yes.
Q: I put words, how would you describe her personality?
A: I don’t think she ever got out from under that cloud of responsibility. And she just
had very different interests. And I was successful in ways that she was not. And that was
hard. That was hard for her because she felt that she had blazed the trail and that I had an
easy time.
Q: You said that before.
A: So for instance I, I mean we both did well at school and stuff and, and skipped you
know the New York City school system if you did well, they didn’t know what to do with
you. There was no such thing as enrichment. They just pushed you ahead so that you
were in the next class. And so they pushed us both ahead and we had some of the same

Q: What high school?
A: High school of music and art. She had tried out for that school (bells ringing).
A: You don’t want to continue where we were.
Q: We will, but no I won’t. Ok. we had a break now and before going back to the point
where we had our break. I wanted to ask a question that I hadn’t before. And that is your
earliest memories total.
A: Well the very earliest memory is of a curtain in probably in the nursery which sort of
we, they were casement windows, which means that they rolled out. And when the
breeze came in, it would lift this curtain which was very airy and lightweight. And it
would lift this curtain up and I just thought of a giant outside the window breathing in
and out because the curtain would rise up and then fall. It would rise up and fall. And I
remember the fabric so distinctly. It was pale sort of a pea green with white leaves ovoid
leaves scattered throughout the curtain. And there was a heavy thread running the warp
of the fabric to make it hang right. And if I ever ran into that I would know that fabric in
a minute.

Q: The logic of a child.
A: The giant.
Q: A giant you know. how could a curtain move like that.
A: Right. repetition, you know in and out, in and out. And we were on the second floor
so it had to be a giant.
Q: So are we talking second floor American or second floor European.
A: Vienna.
Q: So it would be the third floor in the United States because there’s the adgeschloss and
then there is the first floor and then there 1s the second floor. that’s the way it is in
Europe. So if it was the second floor from what you remember from Europe then it
would be the US Third floor.

A: there was a courtyard in the center of the house. Now these houses were very old. So
the courtyard was probably at one time where carriages would enter this large gate of this
entrance and then there would be this courtyard and then these wide curved stairs, going
upstairs.

Q: You didn’t know this at the time though.
A: No we did not. I mean I wasn’t in touch with her. The letters you know went back

apartment sort of like a, like a railroad flat. All the rooms were in line. And, and we
settled in. and war broke out officially September 1.
Q: I mean they got in by a hair’s breadth.
A: By a hair. And so September comes around and we start school. Not speaking English
and my mother described us walking to the school weeping because we couldn’t
understand and couldn’t speak. But the teacher spoke Yiddish and so she said don’t
worry. I’ll take care of them. And you know within weeks we were speaking English.

So we Started school and you know learned English, fit right in.
Q: Cool, very cool.
A: Yeah it was like a magical age you know. [gestures idea of “margin”’| Just that little
margin of adaptability.
Q: And also being shielded and protected from the larger events and the reasons for them.
A: Right, well of course that was all that my parents talked about was what was
happening in Europe and my mother had her family there. And received letters
periodically that had big pieces censored out [gestures “censored pieces’’|, black marks
cut. And so she pieced it together that her father was dying of cancer. And, and pretty
soon those letters stopped.
Q: Did your father ever say to your mother you were right. I was wrong.
A: Not that I know of. No. But they were very, very happy. And then we were at some
kind of family gathering and I don’t re, family was talking and they asked my

grandmother something about how her life was in Europe. Oh, she said it was terrible,
terrible. And it was she never got anything, she never had anything and so my father said
well who bought your shoes. And who paid your passage. And he was just he was
humiliated in front of these strangers who were family. I don’t know what her motivation
was. Maybe she was just stupid. You know she could have been stupid. Or she you
know this was before social security and things like that. Maybe she thought that she
would do better by throwing herself on these relatives. And my father was just more than
incensed.
Q: I can imagine.
A: And that was the end of that. And he took a job in the Bronx and we moved to the
Bronx which was like you know—
Q: Another world.

of absolute unawareness of what his sacrifice had been.

A: He was a carpenter.
Q: His own. Or did he work for somebody.
A: Well he worked for somebody and then he lost patience completely and set up
practically next door. In the Bronx. And so he had an apartment first. And then my
mother noticed, she would walk from the apartment, two blocks around the corner to his
shop. And one day she was walking by and people were moving furniture out of one of
the houses. And so she inquired and it turned out an old lady had lived there and died.
And she, well you know can I buy this house. And I don’t know. They said something
ridiculous, but $5000 and it’s yours. And she went to the bank without my father’s
knowledge, plunked down $5000 and the house was ours. So here was the second time

Rosh Hashanah. He said there was no god if this could happen and ne just turned his back
on the whole thing.
Q: Wow. Because so many other people had the reverse thing. They did not particularly
feel themselves to be Jewish and then when they were targeted said all right now. I’m not
going to pretend to be someone I’m not. Did that seem strange to you at the time or is just
that’s his choice and that’s her choice.
A: Definitely. It was—
Q: What about you and your sister?
A: My sister felt more connected to, to her Jewish heritage. She when they were in
Florida, she participated at a temple. I never have. And her daughter also seems more
connected to the Jewish heritage and not that she keeps a kosher home but she you know
she’s connected to the community. And I’m not.
Q: Was this a conscious thing or is the way you developed in your interests and how they
erew?
A: Well I’m an atheist and I just from my experience and my reading I have come to that
conclusion. If anything, I’d be a Buddhist.

Q: Did your parents eventually find out what happened to various family members?
A: They did. They I mean some people just disappeared like Tager. And I think one of
my father’s brothers just disappeared like a blown leaf. We did know that my grandfather
passed. And we knew that Olga and her mother, my grandmother, were pushed from one
apartment to another. I always thought that they were together, but I subsequently learned
that they also were separated.
Q: How did you discover this?
A: A friend, a cousin of my ex-husband 1s very savvy on the internet and she puzzled it
out.
Q: So it’s a recent knowledge.
A: Yes, yes. I always had a little fantasy that somehow they went off to the Vienna
woods and hid. And survived.

how did your life develop.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 81
A: Well I enjoyed school. I had friends in school. I applied to the high school of music
and art which was a special high school that you auditioned for in New York. And I
prepared a portfolio and auditioned and was accepted. And that was probably the biggest
learning experience.
Q: Was it really?
A: Yes, cause I was with a wide variety of people, very diverse student body from all
over the city. Some very well-heeled people, some people who were very political. There
was one gal whose father was a died and hard communist. There were people of color
which was unusual. That wouldn’t’ have been in the neighborhood school. There was a
Chinese girl that I was very friendly with, Gloria Wong. And when the communists took
over in China, I hadn’t a clue. I said well what do you think? And she said I think it’s
going to be a better thing for China. This was the era of the Rosenberg trials. And it was
very, it was still very conflicted. It was still very, the world was coming to my awareness.
Q: That’s normal when you’re in high school. That’s what happens you know.
A: But I was so happy at that school. I just, I just blossomed. I couldn’t wait for
summer vacation to end and go back to high school, which is not your typical high school
experience.

Q: No it isn’t.
A: But I was very lucky. Yeah. and I still have friends from high school. Yes. And then
when I went off to college, it was a total disappointment. It was not as stimulating as high
school.
Q: Where did you go to college?
A: Well I started out at Brooklyn College. Which was free. The city colleges of New
York, I mean totally unbeknownst to anybody today were free. Just like high school and
so I would meet my friends on the subway. There was quite a little contingent that went
from the Bronx to Brooklyn. Brooklyn College, because they had a very interesting art
department. And but of course you know it was a liberal arts school and so I had classics
and I had history and I had language and yeah.
Q: But it wasn’t as stimulating.
A: No, it was not. It was a come down. We had artists. I mean it was sort of like a carry-
over from the WPA projects where they hired artists in the art department to teach. So I
had Mark Rothko as a teacher. The poor man could not put two words together. He was
a wonderful artist but he was not a teacher. I had Clyfford Still and William Bazeotis and
all these fabulous names today. They were struggling artists at the time. Anyway they

http://collections.ushmm.org

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 83
were not good teachers. And so I decided that and I really wanted to know about art. I
wanted to know the background and so I was interested in art history. And Barnard
College at that time was investing heavily in their art history department. And I was told
to apply and I did and I got in and so I have a degree from Barnard College which is
prestigious.
Q: A question. You mentioned the different languages when you were at home at lunch
time and going back to school. Did that every change. Did you ever end up speaking
English at home?
A: I think, I think yes. As the years went by. They understood. My parents understood
more than they could speak. My mother was pretty proficient but my father there, never,
I mean he spoke Yiddish.
Q: Did he speak any other language besides German and Yiddish. Did he speak Polish,
did he speak Russian, did he speak—
A: He just had a few phrases and he even had what, he had an English phrase like son of
a bitch. Somebody when he was a kid had come back and taught him son of a bitch and
he used that.
Q: He knew that from then.

Q: what prompted you to look back and when did you start looking back?
A: I think ve always been sort of an introspective person. And I realized that my
grandchildren who are not near and have not been close to me or I to them. Cause they’ve
always grown away, grown up away from me.
Q: You mean geographically distant?
A: Yes. But you know geographic distance also means emotional distance. And
knowledge and knowing somebody. So I thought that I would clue them and help them
out to know me a little better.
Q: And that’s what’s prompted the memoirs?
A: Correct, correct.
Q: How far along have you gotten?
A: Well I can’t say it’s a thing that goes chronologically from here to there. It’s a series
of stories. Of things that happened. Of things that I’ve thought about. And we’ll put

Q: Those are the kinds, the most precious gifts now.
A: [hope so, I hope so.
Q: When did you first go back to Vienna?
A: My sister has gone back several times. And then one time, we went together. And we
went with my niece also, Tina, her daughter. And well my sister had some money there.
And she filed for social security basically where she paid into the system and then
accumulated money out of the system, which, which was effective if she spent the money
there. In Europe. And so she was motivated to use that money. I never bothered to pay
into the system. I don’t care about it and I don’t want it. And she planned to live to be a
hundred so she would use it all. That didn’t quite work that way. So we went back hm,
I’m trying to think of when. In the 90s. And maybe 92 or so. And we went to
Rohdenstern Gasse. And we went to the Prater and we went to the Vienna woods and
we went to the opera. And then Pat and I, my partner, went to Vienna also as part of a trip
that included Budapest and Prague. And I don’t like Vienna. I find it stuffy, baroque and
false, pretentious. I don’t, I don’t like it at all.
Q: Is there anything that was familiar or did you, when you went you felt like you were
kind of to a place you had never been before?

A: No, I was tourist, I was a tourist. I had my eyes open and I was curious and we went
to Salzburg, went to a play there. It turned out to be a play about an old age home and
my sister said oh, why do we want to go to see that. Cause it interests me. I didn’t get all
the nuances of the language but I got enough of it. But it was interesting, it was
interesting. We went to performances and I thought that they were just stuffy. They were
for tourists. There was nothing with heart. We went to Bratislava which was just recently
liberated from Russian domination and we went to the opera. And they were, they could
have been bus drivers. It just had, they were just doing a job. You know they had no
heart. They had no emotion in to the part. It was just a businessman’s opera. It was, it
was nothing. It was just nothing.
Q: What a disappointment.
A: Yeah, cause my parents loved opera. And we went to the opera in New York. We
went to the City Center and we went to the Met.

A: Well it’s something called the March of the Living. And apparently, well it’s a
Jewish organization that tries to get young people to understand the Holocaust and their
heritage first hand. So they were mostly young people, but there were some survivors.
And we were on a bus. And I made friends with several people. One of whom, Sophia
Afariat was spent the war years in Poland. And she spoke fluent Polish so she had the
advantage of language. And we went to restaurants and things like that and she could
speak fluently with people. We went to Krakow. We went to Warsaw. And went to
some of the stations that Jews were assembled. We went to the ghetto. It was the first
time that I was with very devout Jews. The young people were devout. They prayed, on
the airplane. So that was the first. And then we went to Israel. (pause, something
happening off camera) We have to stop every time that door opens and closes.
Q: What are the most memorable moments for you of that trip.
A: For the trip. Well seeing Krakow which my father had spoken of was a high point. I
thought that well, um, Warsaw was just a gray depressing place. We had a bus that took
us from one place to another. We had guards on the bus. We had a Polish soldier who
was on leave earning extra money, accompanying us on the bus.
Q: And the purpose of his presence?

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 89
A: Well there’s a lot of anti-Semitism, a lot of anti-Semitism. We went to a little village I
don’t even know that it had a name. But it was a typical village, shtetl, town. The Jewish
synagogue, and there were no more Jews living there but it somehow, I don’t know who
took care of it. So the synagogue had, was neatly tended. And the church was on the top
of the hill. So the church was on the hill. And the synagogue was down here. [gestures
location of church and synagogue| There was a contingent of Polish soldiers, with a tank
stationed at the synagogue. They were playing cards. But there was a military presence.
We passed houses that were very derelict that probably had not been lived in for a
number of years. We passed another place that was like a farm where they were very neat
and tidy. They had cranes nesting in this chimney. I’d never seen anything like that and
that was a tidy farm. So you know if the people who had the place could take care of it,
had the wherewithal to take care of it, had the energy and the skill and maybe some
money to take care of it, they did well. If the people were old, poor, the place was
derelict.
Q: So you saw these types of things—
A: I saw that yes. This lady Sophia, who had spent the war. She was able to talk to our
guard and sort of befriend him and find out who he was. And that’s how I know that he
was on furlough and stuff like that. We went to a place in Krakow that was sort of a folk
art place. And I wanted to buy something for my grandchild who was little at the time.
My first grandchild. And so we bought something there. And I brought it to the hotel,

opened it up and it had shattered into you know 42 pieces. So the next day we went back
and I said well you know this, you packed it poorly. I need something else. And oh, no.
No they wouldn’t, they wouldn’t’ honor that and so Sophia said we are Jews. And she
played the Jew card. I was so embarrassed. I was so embarrassed that she felt it necessary
to draw that card. And he said ok, pick out something else. We went to a Jewish
cemetery and there was this little old lady scuttling through the cemetery. And Sophia
started talking to her. And she had spent the war. She was Jewish. She had spent the war
there. She, she had no prospects of going anywhere else.
Q: The lady in the cemetery?
A: Yes. And that was her life. I don’t know, I think she was doing a short cut through
the cemetery to her home. Yeah. And she lived in that town with her daughter.
Q: Did you feel in some way distant from these things or close to these things?
A: No, I felt close to that, I did. It was very emotional. And when we went to Auschwitz
there were graffiti, anti-Semitic graffiti on the walls outside of Auschwitz, just outside.
They do keep the grounds themselves preserved. But it was very emotional. And so I left
a note saying you know but for fortunate kindness in this world, I would be here too.

Interview with Kitty Weiss Penner 92

escape? With your children, with your grandchildren?

Pressman made. They have the book. They have very casual interest in it all.
Q: How do you think it shaped you? Did it shape you? Did it contribute to you being the
kind of person that you are today?
A: Oh, completely.
Q: In what way’?
A: I don’t know. If I had remained in Austria, and there had been no war, I would be a
German hausfrau.
Q: Artist?
A: I don’t know. I think that women still have a very tangential life there. I think it’s still
very patriarchal. I think there is still some anti-Semitism that keeps people from

dreaming and thinking that they could be something more. I don’t think I’d have the
education that I have. I’d be somebody else.
Q: In your personality, has it had an effect on things that are your values or the way you
look at things, that early history.
A: Well I think my mother’s message that I’m going to have a wonderful time and to be
Open to new experience has been my way of doing things.
Q: What a wonderful gift.
A: I know.
Q: Tell me about how the rest of their years were here in the United States.
A: My, when my sister hit adolescence my father lost it. He, he wanted to impose kind
of the old protection. He did not understand that girls have you know rights and thoughts
of their own. He made life very hard for her. Constant bickering and constant picking on
her, constant demeaning. He did not understand that she wanted to wear something that
he didn’t’ approve of. Lipstick drove him up the wall. And, and she, she was destroyed.
And my mother could not stop him. I don’t know what he had in mind. Loose women

you know wear lipstick and he just, he just had a totally, totally other way of looking at a
young woman.
Q: It sounds almost like a village he came through.
A: Exactly. Don’t be this and don’t be that and be careful here [gestures with hand] and
be careful there and he just made her life miserable. Somehow I did not get it into his
craw the way she did. That was something deep set him off. I did not buck him. I put on
lipstick around the corner. I did not, I didn’t, I didn’t defy him. I just went my own way.
And somehow, he could accept that. So again she was the pioneer. She got the full brunt
of his ire. And the only way she could think of to get out of it was to get married which
she did when she was 17.
Q: Very young.
A: Didn’t work out too well. Of course. So.
Q: Your parents, did they stay in that nice brick house in the Bronx.
A: They did. Until my sister, my sister divorced that husband and remarried and they,
with her new husband and her daughter who was Tina was about eight by that time,
moved to Florida. My parents had vacationed in Florida. Just briefly you know go on

two weeks’ vacation. They liked it. And I don’t know if you were around at the time but
Arthur Godfrey radio program really was a spokesman for Florida. And he talked up
Florida. And so my sister asked my father to come down and build something for her. To
build, I don’t know, some kind of storefront and of course he went. And he was not a
young man at that time. So my mother saw an opportunity to get him out of his regular
routine and they started talking about retiring to Florida.
Q: Nice.
A: Which they did.
Q: Where in Florida?
A: They bought a place in Coral Gables. They like Miami. There was a large Jewish
contingent there, a lot of lands people. And they were very happy there.
Q: Did they ever go back to Europe?
A: No. At one point my father wanted me to go with him to some of his haunts like Bad
Kastine. And I had little kids at the time and so it wasn’t that, I couldn’t do it. Yeah.
Q: They passed away in Florida?

Q: Oh my gosh, how young.
A: Yeah. And my father was like 12 or 13 years older, he lived to be 88. On his own, in
Florida.
Q: On your journey over to the United States what would you want your grandchildren
and everybody else’s grandchildren cause this will be on the internet, what would you
want them to understand the most about that journey?
A: Hm. I think it is to just keep an open mind and keep your eyes open to experience
things for yourself, not what somebody told you, not what you read in a book, just be
there. Be there and see it for yourself. And live it for yourself. And make whatever
sense you can of that experience. It'll be your own.
Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add to what we’ve talked about today.
A: No it’s been good. Thank you.
