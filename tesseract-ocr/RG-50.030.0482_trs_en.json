            "question": "This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Helen Bamber, conducted by Vera Frankel on December 28\", 2003, in London. This is tape number one, side A. Helen Bamber, tell me about your background first of all, where you grew up and the family you grew up in.",
            "answer": "I grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in North London. My father was born in America. My mother was born in the UK, in England, of course, as it was then. Their parents came from Poland and Russia respectively. Interestingly, one of my grandfathers was actually born, we found out many years later, in what was -- and my pronunciation is poor, forgive me, Oswiecim, Auschwitz. And that sent shivers down our spine many years later. Now, it wasn\u2019t a happy household. My father was an accountant. He was a very obsessional man, and during most of my childhood -- I grew up, by the way -- I was born in 1925. So I grew up in the years of unemployment, dole queues, and the rise of fascism. And I think this combination absorbed my father completely inasmuch as he was something of a visionary. He could see, I believe, what was going to happen in Europe. He was bilingual, he spoke German perfectly, and a number of other languages, and I\u2019ve never understood how it was that a man who was not -- you know, was quite simply educated in this country, a good scholar, but how it was that he spoke the languages he did, and how he could be bilingual in German. I never understood that, and I don\u2019t now, but he was. So, as an only child, in a house in north London, with diminishing financial resources, as my father\u2019s activities on behalf of people who were -- who needed to leave Nazi Germany became more -- how can I say more active, or more -- yes, more active. And as I was exposed to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I\u2019m losing my thread, but what I\u2019m trying to do is to give a background about an only child growing up in what was later a working class area, because we had to move from a rather sumptuous house to something very modest. Was a a--akind of house of -- of s-something bordering on fear and apprehension of what might happen in the future. My father insisted that we listened to the broadcasts from Germany, which he would translate. So that as a young child, I -- I was exposed to quite a lot of my father\u2019s understanding and vision, but also his fears, and my own. N -- my mother tried hard to avoid all this by -- and it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t care, it was that like so many people of her time, and h - and as is always the case, she actually couldn\u2019t face the possibility of what might happen. She began to disengage as much as she could. As my father\u2019s activities became, as I said earlier, more -- more active, there were refugees from Germany who came to our house, en route perhaps for somewhere else, but would often stay in my house for some days, weeks, and -- and as a sickly child, on top of everything else, because I had what later was thought to have been TB, tuberculosis, which is very common in my time, many children had it, I was bi -- be -- I was bedridden for a lot of my -- of the winters of my childhood. And they -- there were -- people who came and stayed would often come and talk to me, sit on my bed and talk to me, but they wouldn\u2019t talk to me about childhood events, or childhood dreams, and -- and fantasies, and 1 - yo-you know, celebration. It was about what happened to them, and what was -- what happened in Germany. And I remember there was a pianist who stayed with us, who I disliked very much. I found him pompous, although he played beautifully. And he came and sat on my bed frequently. But he made a great change in my life, in my childish -- my childhood. He said to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

If you want to, you can get out of bed when I leave this room, and you can walk round the room, touch all the furniture, and get back into bed, and say to yourself, I am now in control of myself.\u201d Now, I disliked him more than ever when he said this, because of course, illness can be a retreat, and a way of avoiding issues. But I did exactly what he said. I got up and I walked round the room, and I touched everything, and I said to myself. \u201cI can make changes, I can be in control.\u201d I wasn\u2019t very confident, but I said it. And I don\u2019t know, I think that was a -- a turning point for me."

            "question": "Looking back, how do you think that the family atmosphere, and your father\u2019s outlook on life influenced your personality, and your thinking?",
            "answer": "I think it was a very hard upbringing in some ways, although I don\u2019t want to magnify it. I was very moved by my father. I still am when I look back and I think of his loneliness and his despair later on, when the Holocaust came. But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother\u2019s social skills, her interest in clothes, her interest in the piano, and her desire for me to be somehow -- I don\u2019t know, something very special. Not unusual, of course, in Jewish families. But it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between them both, really. Later they divorced; when I was in my late teens, they divorced. But it was an unhappy household, and I\u2019m not sure that I - I mean, I think I had a good role model for my future in human rights. I\u2019m not sure that I had a good role model in terms of relationships, and 1n terms of parenting. I learned, though, as a -- as an only child in an unhappy household, with these issues, I learned how to negotiate, and I learned how to compromise. And these, I think, are skills I have. And that comes not only from later experience, but I learned it in the family home."

            "answer": "I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- forgive me, I grew up in the war. What can I say about it? In some ways, it was almost -- it\u2019s crazy to say this, it was almost a relief from the fear of be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans came, specially chosen for annihilation. So in other words, when I was involved in a bombing incident, when I was fire watching in central London, when central London was terribly bombed, and was buried, albeit it -- it -- 1t wasn\u2019t as dramatic or terrible as it sounds, but I was -- I wasn\u2019t hurt. I suppose in modern terminology, I was somewhat traumatized, and I still find it difficult to go downstairs because I was on -- I was -- I was firewatching in a solicitor\u2019s office, and standing on some steps, going down to the basement where all the documents were kept with little bits of pink ribbon tying them up. And I was going -- there was only about four or five steps, but as I stood on the top step, the steps collapsed under me. And I think that yes, I do have a phobia from that time, but I also know that -- that I ti -- I felt at the time, and I still do, that I was taking my chances with the rest of the population, and that I wasn\u2019t being particularly chosen at that particular time. And so in a mad sort of way, the war had it\u2019s reliefs for me, although it killed, in another bombing incident, an aunt of mine, who had a great influence on me, who was considerably left wing. Did a lot of work in the east end of London, working with the Communists, and the Jewish community there in trying to combat the activities of Mosely\u2019s fascists. And she was involved in the much glorified battle of Cable Street, which is an incident where when Mosely was going to march down one particular area of the east end, the people of the east end brought out all their furniture, their -- their pianos, their -- their tables, their kitchen equipment, and they blocked the roads of the east end. And for me, with a father who was growing into despair as to what was happening in Europe, this simple act meant a great deal to me. It was about resistance, and it was about finding ways, even if they didn\u2019t succeed ultimately This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So my aunt was another very strong influence in my life because she represented anything but despair. She was vigorous, she was sexy. She had the strangest advice as to how to behave in any sexual encounter. She was a fascinating, vigorous, lovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shocking everybody, platinum blonde hair, but also doing these fantastic things. An -- and she was a -- she was a very interesting influence in my life, and it was a terrible blow to me when she -- when she and her fianc\u00e9, someone I think she might have married, were killed when the Caf\u00e9 de Paris had a direct hit."

So I always knew, I always knew about the concentration camps. It was no secret in my house that people were being taken to concentration camps and murdered. We weren\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t always know -- now when I look back, it\u2019s difficult to be accurate. Whether the details were known, I\u2019m not su -- to me, I\u2019m not sure, but certainly the word concentration camps, in my German -- my father would say it in German, was well known in my household. So it wasn\u2019t a stranger to me."

It wasn\u2019t the photographs that shocked me so much as the attitude of people. And I think that if I\u2019m not mistaken, that the photographs were discontinued; that means to say the exhibition was discontinued because of people\u2019s reactions. Now, I\u2019m not quite sure what that reaction was, but you know, after the war people did not want to believe, they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened, and they didn\u2019t really -- they had their own preoccupations with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and rationing, and everything else. And to bring home to people the atrocities of the Nazis in that - to that extent, I think either didn\u2019t move people in the right way -- but whatever happened, it didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that it was received with -- with -- with real comprehension, I think, with This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It wasn\u2019t the pictures though, I think, that influenced me to -- to want to go to Germany at the end of the war. I think that I\u2019d started to think about it for quite a long time, and I -- I\u2019m -- and in - it\u2019s very interesting that the more one talks about this, the more you begin to understand, or the more you think about it, you begin to understand your motives. People often ask me why did I want to go to the camps, wh -- was it some voyeuristic reason, was it -- what was it that made me want to go and to work for the survivors. And I think it really, now talking today, I think it wasn\u2019t only my father, because my father was sunk in despair at the end of the war, whereas everybody was rejoicing, and even I was rejoicing, my father was despairing because of the - the catastrophic events that had happened, and the -- the death of so many people, not only in the concentration camps, but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war, I think just -- just crushed him, and he was very despairing. He also had his own personal reasons for -- he was living alone then, and he was very sad. But I think it was also my aunt, because my aunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to my father. And her belief was you must do something, you can do something, you can do anything if you want to. And so I suppose it was my father\u2019s knowledge, and my aunt\u2019s kind of message about go for it, anybody can do it, do something, make a statement, however -- even if you\u2019re waving your arms and nobody\u2019s watching, do it, was what she was about. I think that\u2019s really what influenced me."

            "question": "Let me ask you something. Could you tell me what the unit consisted of, who organized it, how it was run, how big it was?",
            "answer": "The Jewish Relief Unit when I first came upon it was a small office near Woburn House in that square, Woburn Square, or Ensley Place I think was it\u2019s name. It was a -- a house on a corner, and it consisted of an office with about six or seven people in it. It was financed, I think, by the -- now I\u2019m not sure about that, it might have been the Central British Fund, I cannot remember. This -- this could easily be established how the organization was funded. I do have a book about it, but I don\u2019t read the book, and I\u2019m not sure why. But anyway, there is a lot of information about the funding of this organization. And there were people being trained to go. And these were people who were volunteers, it was a volunteer organization, nobody was paid to go, as far as I know. And I started to -- to -- to train with them, telling my parents -- I was then living with my mother; my father was separated, as I said. And this was going to be quite a difficult issue. I remember sitting in Saint James\u2019s Park, and watching the ducks where I\u2019d met my father, and I said to him, \u201cI -- I want to go to Germany.\u201d And he didn\u2019t really say very much. He said, \u201cWell, you must be sure you want to go, and you\u2019l|l have to be safe and careful.\u201d Which hadn\u2019t actually occurred to me at the time, about being safe. Being careful, yes. But he -- he didn\u2019t express great enthusiasm or dismay or surprise or -- my mother, of course, was aghast. And her dreams of what she had expected of me for the future began to disappear to some extent, for her. She saw me taking a path that she really didn\u2019t like, and I suppose as a mother now it was, looking back, it must have been hard for her. But I was very determined to go. And so I continued to -- to train, to -- to be exposed to a psychologist who in pri -- in small intimate sessions would -- individual sessions would ask you questions, but also in group sessions. And I suppose there were about 20 of us volunteers at the time, who -- not all Jewish by the way, and I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

There were several Quakers, people who felt very strongly about what had happened, who wanted to -- who offered their -- their services. And so that\u2019s what I did, and we went on various training courses, to a kibbutz somewhere in England, in Wiltshire, I believe, where we undertook various training in map reading and first aid, and -- but I do remember -- I do remember one session where we sat in a group and I think it was the psychologist asked everyone what they felt they expected to find, and how they would deal with the very impossible situations, and how they would deal with people who they cou -- who felt - who didn\u2019t want to be helped, or were past helping. And I remember searching my -- my th thoughts at the time, and trying to think what -- what is the answer to that, faced with a lot of people who you can\u2019t help. And I remember saying that maybe one has to accept that there will be people you can\u2019t save. And maybe if there are children and younger people there, we have to put our energies into trying to help them. And that maybe -- this now sounds all rather simplistic, but and maybe if -- if people see the energy going into the young and the children, that would be some compensation for them. I don\u2019t think it was such a bad idea now, looking back, because there were many people that couldn\u2019t be helped. Anyway, that was -- that was what I said at the time.

There were nurses, there were people with a variety of skills at the time. And - but I can\u2019t remember sitting down and really -- th-th-there was just that one discussion we had in which we were asked to face the possibility of not being able to help everyone, not being able to save everyone. It is important because it stayed in my mind and it -- it\u2019s the situation that I\u2019m faced with every day of my life now. And it\u2019s always hard, it\u2019s always hard and it should always be hard. But it has to be there, that acceptance that you can\u2019t save everyone. But it\u2019s so hard. We went to various -- as I said, we went to this kibbutz, and I remember I drove with somebody in a van, and the idea was that we had to follow the map and find our own way there. And map reading and finding our way around with a lot of emphasis, I think on practical help, on the provisions to be given. On the -- on the question of driving, and map reading, and knowing how to distribute the wherewithal, food, or provisions and so on. I don\u2019t really remember, even with the help of the psychologist, a great deal of help about how we would feel, faced with what we were going to face, which wasn\u2019t only about a d -- a -- a d-devastated people, devastated in every sense of the word. Suffering from malnutrition, suffering from loss, some behaving as if they were quite mad, all of that. But it was also that we were going to a country that was in rubble, and starving. And I certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for the fact -- I\u2019d hardened all these years my heart against the German people. I\u2019d grown up with a dislike and fear of the Germans. And when I was on the train going out, on my own, with all my luggage and baggage and God knows what -- I mean, what a performance that was, I remember seeing starving German children standing along the railway line, holding out their hands. And I was traveling with soldiers, British soldiers, and everybody threw out their bread and whatever they had with them to the starving children. Now that I wasn\u2019t prepared for, and that was hard too, because these were children, these were innocent children. And that brought a conflict that I hadn\u2019t -- or an understanding that I hadn\u2019t This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I learned that the very first moment I traveled. So there were many things one wasn\u2019t prepared for. One wasn\u2019t prepared for the devastated cities. No, we weren\u2019t prepared, but maybe there was no way to prepare us, because nobody really knew, I think, how catastrophic was the scene that we were t-to find eventually."

So not only was I kitted out beyond belief with a -- a kind of a canvas thing that was like a mobile bath, or whatever, and a kit bag that really I could barely lift.

But it was very good for underwear and you could smack the two pieces together when anybody came in, and nobody could see. So that\u2019s what I did with that.

And why I traveled on my own I do not know, but I think there was a very difficult procedure before anybody was allowed to go. There was a very careful vetting of every individual, not necessarily verbally, I mean I didn\u2019t meet anybody, but I know that there was one woman who belonged to the Communist party, who was not allowed to go. Which was a very great disappointment to all of us who knew and loved her. So, there was a very careful vetting of each individual, and I think there was a fear by the officials involved, that Jews going out were in some way -- Jews going out to work in the former concentration camps, or in Holland, or in Greece were somehow either a provocation or a difficulty, an embarrassment, difficult to control. Whatever it was, it was difficult. And so everybody was vetted very carefully, and although we came under the auspices directly of UNRRA, we were also responsible directly also, to the British military government. At least we were in the British zone, that means to say those of us who went to Germany. I had to go -- I mean, my final destination was a small village called Eilshausen, which I -- I kept spelling in my head all the time, E-i-l-s. Eilshausen. It was difficult for me. I\u2019d spoke some German by the way, because I\u2019d learned from my father enough German to get by. And the worst of all was that I went on a train from Victoria -- and I remember people were very helpful to me because I\u2019m not very tall, and with all this heavy kit, the soldiers were good, and they would lift things for me. But of course they were also very -- they would also look quite quizzically at -- at the yellow star. So I was constantly in conversation, having to explain oneself. Why one was going, what one was doing. And it was the beginning 1n a way of a kind of role in society, in the public, that was always slightly uncomfortable for me, and it exists to this day, where I have to explain what I\u2019m doing for asylum seekers and refugees. And so I -- I'd already begun then to explain what I was doing with the yellow star on my shoulder. [tape break] Where am I? This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I hadn\u2019t been out of England before, which is strange in this day and age, but I had never been out of England. And so this was the first time I\u2019d been out. And I was very alone. Eventually we took our turn and we were put on the train. And I remember something quite awful about this train because it would always stop at various places which were not a station. I mean, in other words I couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t -- you had no platform, you had to get off the train, so to speak, without a platform, in order to go to wherever you were going to be fed on the way, which again was a kind of Nissen hut, specially prepared for the soldiers en This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And you would sit at a long table and -- and be fed. And I had the utmost difficulty with my height, in being able to mount this train. And this was one of the -- the extraordinary things that preoccupied me on the journey, all k-kind of, sort of incidental ridiculous things, not about the seriousness of my task, but how in heaven\u2019s name I was going to get up and down this train without making a complete idiot of myself. And usually I had to be hauled up and pushed from behind. But the train ricketed along, and there was one bridge that we crossed when we were in Germany, when the German guard, or person on the train came through carrying a lantern. Achtung, achtung, and inviting us all to stand at one side of the train so that we actually balanced it properly, because there was a danger that the -- you know, that -- I don\u2019t know, that maybe the train would topple over. Whatever it was, that\u2019s what we all did. And then there were the children on the way. And if -- you know, the journey was a bit of a nightmare because I was so terrified that I would not find myself at this tiny village -- no, it wasn\u2019t Eilshausen, do forgive me, Eilshausen was my final destination. The station I had to get out at was Badounhausen. Badenhausen, which was a base for British soldiers. And I had to find my way from Badenhausen, which was quite a long way, to Eilshausen, which was the headquarters of our unit, where Henry Lunzer, the capt -- a former captain in the British army, and who was then the director of the Jewish reli-lief unit, had set up our headquarters in the village. And because of the fact that I had taken a secretarial course at some stage, and was quite proficient in shorthand and typing, I was for the moment, to be his assistant. And so that was my route, Badenhausen and then on to Eilshausen. I had no idea how I was going to get to Eilshausen. Well eventually I managed to get out of the station, and I\u2019Il never forget it, it was an extraordinary sensation. I was in Germany, I was on a German station all on my own, with all my stuff. And I remember walking down the steps and walking into the street. And I remember hearing German, seeing This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And it was the -- didn\u2019t -- doesn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t happen to me very often, but I really for the moment was frozen. And I remember standing there and thinking, \u201cMy God,\u201d you know, \u201cwhat have I done?\u201d I\u2019m in the middle of Germany -- it isn\u2019t the middle of Germany, but you know -- I\u2019m in Germany, and I\u2019m with all this stuff. And I actually had to get the things down in -- in dribs and drabs. I think somebody helped me because I couldn\u2019t carry all the stuff down the steps in one go. I think somebody did help me, and I was standing there. A British officer came up in a car. And of course, this is what happens, and you learn this in post-war situations. There is a kind of help that doesn\u2019t normally exist that you - you suddenly get used to. He drove up and he said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d And I said, \u201cI -- I have to get to Eilshausen.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere the devil is that?\u201d I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell get in the car and I\u2019Il take you to my head -- my HQ, and -- and we\u2019|l try and find out where Eilshausen 1s.\u201d So I went with him to his HQ in Badenhausen. And you know, I can\u2019t remember whether I ate -- I can remember cleaning up, I do remember that. I remember there was some sort of provision there, and I -- I cleaned myself up a bit. I must have been filthy because the week in Calais, it was not the most hygienic. And I felt an awful wreck, I remember that. And eventually -- but I don\u2019t remember eating anything at all, except on the train. And then he came down, and he was very efficient, rather like something you see in British war films now, on a Sunday. You know, very elegant, very beautiful, very well spoken. And he said, \u201cLook, I - I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve found a -- I\u2019ve found somebody who -- we found Eilshausen, it\u2019s a small village, Pll get you there.\u201d I\u2019m still conscious of the yellow star. I was very grateful that somehow -- you know, this -- this curious thing of sh -- of pride and shame, you know, what was the yellow star going to do for us out there?

And they found a driver for me, and finding a driver and finding a truck in those days was hard work. So I had to wait quite a long time, and then I was taken to Eilshausen. And I remember when I got to Eilshausen, which is a tiny, little village, and I met with Henry Lunzer, and I think he -- he and I at that time, at that moment, were the only people there, although some British officers were coming over that evening for whatever, I don\u2019t know what it was. And he was in -- we were in a commandeered house. It was the house of the local Nazi, and that was the kind of way things were done there, that people were billeted in the houses of the former Nazis. And the former Nazi would have been Nazi leader, I don\u2019t know whether he was imprisoned or whatever the situation was for him. But certainly some of his staff was still around, and I was very conscious of that."

Not so much the village itself, because some of the houses were modern, you know, spacious, fantastic houses in their own grounds, with a laundry room and you name it. But the walks were brilliant. The woods were lovely and we would often walk in the woods. And there was a woman called Frau Mometchka who was German, who had married a Jew, and who died in the concentration camp, her husband did. And she really belonged nowhere. Because of her background she could not live within the German community. And oh -- because of -- she didn\u2019t quite belong in the house.

And she would talk to me about her husband, she would talk to me about music, she would try to correct my terrible German. She was very much a teacher, a scholar.

I remember staying all night one -- on one occasion with s-somebody who died in one of the rooms. And it was over time talking to people in the rooms that bu -- was my first encounter with the inmates. Now, it wasn\u2019t on that first day. That first day was a kind of initiation into the whole atmosphere of Bergen-Belsen at that time. I met the unit -- the workers. I went to camp one, which had been burned down. I saw the mounds, these huge mounds where had -- which had formed the mass graves. It was very -- there was always about that place particularly, that camp one, there was this strange, sweet smell which I -- I know to be the smell of death. I believe it to be, but I always refer to it as the smell of geraniums, because that\u2019s what it was like. It was like taking the leaves of the geraniums and crushing them in your hand and then smelling them. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a sweet, dank smell, and that was the smell. And I\u2019ve never forgotten it. And sometimes I\u2019m reminded of it when the smell returns, that kind of dank smell. And this sense of awfulness, the sense of death was there in that space that was empty. There were no bodies, there was nothing. There were no birds, nothing stirred, it was just a terrible, empty space. And yet you -- you felt all the time as though someone was behind you, or someone was by the side of you. You felt very uneasy. I -- I know that I went there the first day, and I went there many times with other people who were involved in some kind of mourning. They may be people who had come as Jewish soldiers -- much later, this was much later -- or they were the inmates, although very few of them went there. But I went there sometimes, and I attended the ceremony there, where the monument was erected, the first monument, in memory. I believe there\u2019s a picture somewhere of my unit marching. It\u2019s somewhere in the Vina library, and I\u2019ve never been to see it, but I believe it exists, because people have told me that it does, and they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

But I returned many times, and I spent many days there, and I spent a long period in the winter, because I remember sleeping in a sleeping bag with all my clothes on in the very cold winters that followed. And what was I doing there? And that\u2019s the difficulty, I can\u2019t really remember that I had a particular role as I had in other places. I went and I talked, and I can\u2019t remember anybody asking me to do that, or seeing any value in it. So maybe I elected to go. When I knew that a driver or somebody was going to Belsen, which was very frequent, people frequently went there with provisions or with papers, or what have you. There was no other way of communicating than by going somewhere. The telephone systems were down, and it was very difficult to make telephone calls. And so it was -- the easiest thing was to always go to a place. So it is not surprising that I elected to go, and I elected to go I think because over time I found that by talking to people -- that by receiving the information that they gave me, was in itself a v -- a v - a value. That doesn\u2019t sound very profound, but people who give the most terrible information, of death, destruction, loss. Who rock with misery and despair, who are desperately fearful, who want to die, many of them, but can\u2019t, it\u2019s very important to receive that information in a way that says to people, I am your witness, I am here to tell your story. If you can\u2019t tell it, I will be able to tell it for you. But all I can be is your witness, I can\u2019t take away the past. Now I didn\u2019t learn that quickly, I learned it painfully because I always felt I couldn\u2019t do anything, what am I doing here? I can\u2019t take away the past, I can\u2019t change anything. So what is the value of my presence, and why do I keep coming? And I think it was because I began to learn that being a witness, simple and ordinary and limited as that may be, does have a value to the person who may not live very long, and who knows it. And so, I think in a way that was one of my tasks, but why I spent so many weeks there, sleeping on the floor, and what work I did with Henry there, or with anybody else, I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I later went back there many times, when I was responsible much later for what was referred to as the TB train. I was sent to nic -- by Henry, to negotiate in Switzerland with a Jewish organization, humanitarian organization for the transfer of young people suffering from tuberculosis, who -- whose chance of recovery would be very much greater if they were taken to Switzerland to recover, which was one of the ways people treated tuberculosis in those days. And I went to Switzerland and I met this extraordinary woman. And I remember saying to her -- I wasn\u2019t in uniform, and I don\u2019t know why, maybe it was politic -- no, to be -- I just can\u2019t remember. And I remember saying to her, \u201cWhy -- why -- how did you recognize me?\u201d And she said, \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t difficult to recognize you, I would have recognized you anywhere, as one Jew to another.\u201d Anyway, I went with the x-rays, and when I say I went with the x-rays, believe me, I\u2019m saying something extraordinary. Because to persuade people, young people, who were desperate to leave Belsen and other camps, desperate to get out, to emigrate to America or to England, desperate to get out. To persuade them to have an x-ray to identify that they were suffering tuberculosis was the last thing that they wanted."

And then I had to persuade this -- to go with this delightful woman and persuade the Swiss authorities. And I remember a very suave, very beautiful, tall Swiss gentleman, who made clear to me, reluctantly, that yes, a certain number of young people would be acceptable to the Swiss, to go to Davose to be treated for their tuberculosis, on the understanding only that they were -- could recover, and that they could return to Germany at the end of their treatment. And that was th -- one of the first political lessons of my lifetime, because I learned about the la -- lo -- lack of compassion, I lat -- learned about politics, and in that one meeting, I learned it all. I learned about officialdom, bureaucracy that -- that -- that -- tha-tha - that -- that protects people from the truth, 1t protects people from looking at that sick, young person. And I was very sick at heart myself, I was very upset. But I'd actually got the agreement, so I went back to Germany, and then there was an enormous activity on my part, and others helping me, to try to arrange for the evacuation of the young people. And I have pictures of this that can be supplied, to go on what was referred to as the TB train from Hanover station, which was bombed and derelict, catastrophically so, to Switzerland. And eventually -- I mean it was, I suppose, a triumph, but nothing -- it didn\u2019t feel like a triumph, really. Nothing -- it just felt right, I suppose, that young people should be treated eventually after many months, having fought with many officials, British army officials in -- particularly on one occasion, when I needed a document that hadn\u2019t come. They needed about five or six different permissions in order to leave the camps, from the British military government. And if they hadn\u2019t got all five or six, they couldn\u2019t travel. And in one case I had to go to Dusseldorf, I think 1t was, and persuade them to allow a young person in Dusseldorf to travel to Switzerland. And I think we were all day trying to persuade them. Finally I think it was only because we offered a lift. We were going to Berlin to catch the train, to put the document on the train. I mean, it\u2019s all very primitive stuff.

And finally I got the documents. Eventually the train went, but it was made clear to me by UNRRA and the Red Cross, that if -- that I was short of one particular document necessary for the TB train. And that, you know, I would be held responsible for that, that everything was on course, that the TB train would come. It was all arranged by the Red Cross, but that at the last minute, there could be a hitch, and that that was my responsibility because I hadn\u2019t got this document. So I remember standing on this train, waiting for it to go, and the sense of fear and trepidation, everybody was happy. The children, the young people were laughing and singing and looking out of the window, and I was terrified that at the end of the day there would be a hitch. Some official, some army official would come along and say I\u2019m so sorry, but this is not correct, there\u2019s -- something here is missing. However, it went. And I remember jumping off the train and think, my God, it\u2019s gone. And looking at this train -- and you\u2019ve got to picture Hanover station without a roof, with things hanging down, and this train wobbling away, and the kids hanging out of the window. And I remember standing there with tears running down my face and thinking it\u2019s going to be all right, they\u2019re going to go -- I don\u2019t know what happened to the children."

So I think with the creativity that existed amongst some of the survivors, and our own need to feed into that, we were able to support some of the things that were going on. For example, Yosul, and Dr. Bunko, and somebody called Norbert Fallheim, who later committed suicide, formed a committee within the camp. They were representatives of the camp. We were the next sort of go-between between ourselves, between them, and UNRRA, and the military government. So we would naturally, whilst we were supporting what they were doing, at the same time we would become the recipients of much of their anger. And I can remember sitting in an old Merck car that had been commandeered from somewhere by somebody, sort of closely packed in at the back with Norbert, and Yosul, and somebody else, and myself desperately trying to take notes with Henry and somebody else in the front, while they were raging and ranting and very angry indeed.

            "question": "This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Helen Bamber. Now, the survivors who you dealt with were now officially displaced persons. What did that mean?",
            "answer": "Well, first of all it meant that as far as the officials were concerned, the word survivor or victim had gone out of their vocabulary, and the word displaced persons, which 1s a sort of anonymous terms for a glob of people, is quite a useful shield, just as we use the word asylum seekers today, so the word displaced persons, and then DPs, even worse, was used. So the compassion that was there at the very beginning, and the sense of outrage when the camp was liberated, had gone, in my view. And the DPs, displaced persons were seen as a problem, number one. So, in emotional terms, in political terms, in psychological terms, displaced persons meant a nuisance, a -- a problem. They were vocal, they\u2019d become articulate, they had their committee, they were demanding, they wanted rights. What wa -- what rights did they want? They wanted rights within the camp, as far as I remember. They wanted rights of travel. They wanted to be able to move about Germany. And that was very difficult because as far as I remember, and this  this can be corrected by others, the people in the camps were not allowed to leave or to travel without special permit. Now, in the early days, many of the young displaced persons went particularly, as I remember, to Poland, mainly to try to find their relatives. They went to their old, former homes to find their relatives. When they got there, they were set upon by the local people, who drove them out, and some killings took place, and some assaults took place. And the people, bedraggled, and often with torn shoes and bleeding feet, would return back into Germany, and back, as it were, behind barbed wire, behind the camp. I use barbed wire as a -- as a -- to cover what I mean by that kind of incarceration. So their options were very limited.

Now we had set up a search bureau in Belsen. And that was one of the things that one of the volunteers in our unit had trained at doing was to set up a search bureau. People who would come to the camp, again presumably illegally because they would come and there was no way in which they should have been able to enter or to leave, with little bits of like cigarette paper, rolled up paper. It was probably cigarette paper, with the names of relatives on it, asking has anybody seen or heard of so and so? And the names would be on these little bits of paper. And they would give them to you, or they would give them to anybody. They would just hand them out, and you would -- you would do your best."

Whether it did it adequately, I can\u2019t say. It was primitive. But in some cases people were reunited. There were other search bureaus that were established as time went on. I\u2019m not quite sure if the Red Cross was not involved also in trying to reunite people. That also can be confirmed. I have -- you -- you know, I have a very fragmented, compartmentalized memory of this particular period of my life. So I can\u2019t really speak with authority about the organization of the search bureaus. I know that there were several, I know that we had one in the camp.

In other words, so many from -- you know, that you\u2019re on the German quota list, or the Romanian, Hungarian, or Polish. But what I do know was that it wasn\u2019t possible simply to enter the US, or the UK, not really. Some people did, and they\u2019re very proud of it, and they say it as though anybody could have done it, but they must forgive me, I don\u2019t believe it was so easy for everybody to do it, otherwise they would have done it. I-It\u2019s -- 1t was hard for people, they couldn\u2019t get out, and they couldn\u2019t go anywhere. They couldn\u2019t go -- the Iron Curtain had already fallen, they couldn\u2019t go to the Iron Curtain countries. They knew that they would be badly treated if they did. They knew what was going on by returnees. And so what were their options? To find their relatives, to -- but then, as the months passed people realized that nothing had happened. Perhaps they had found a relative, perhaps they\u2019d accepted that that was it, that nobody was alive. Or they lived in hopes, but they still wanted to get out. Outside the camps, of course, the Germans were beginning to mingle, to fraternize with British, American and other soldiers in the various zones. And this came very hard to the inmates, the fact that they were still displaced persons while something else was going on outside. I believe then that a hardening of attitudes took place, a realization for many that they were not wanted. That was the feeling, that nobody really wanted to open their doors. I mean, many people returned to Holland, some maybe to France. But on the whole, people This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So, I think that is when -- and again I must be forgiven by tha- by those people who see it differently, but I begin that 1 -- I believe that it was then that the idea of becoming more Zionist, wanting to go to Palestine is the only solution for their problem. And I believe it was then that it really became an entrenched desire and need, and mission. So people began to learn Hebrew if they didn\u2019t already know it. They became more militant. There were the illegal transportations to -- to cross frontiers to try to get illegally to Palestine one way or another. And of course, many people perished on the way."

And I can\u2019t tell you where it was, but it was a group of DPs who had been found crossing the Dutch frontier illegally and they were now being held, and had been held for many months in this camp. And in this camp, when we eventually got there, we found that the camp was also a holding place for infamous war criminals and Germans who had -- who -- with a -- with a poor reputation. So I went with the leader of the Jewish brigade, who drove one lorry, and I think, too, we had another lorry with - or truck, large truck, which would house another group, and a small, kind of mobile ambulance which was intended for the pregnant woman who was quite near term. So I think we probably had a nurse with us. I can\u2019t remember that, but I would imagine so, otherwise it would not be necessary or prudent to just have the ambulance. So I think we must have had a nurse with us. So there were several of us, and when we got to the camp, the lorries stood in the comp -- in the main kind of open area, bef -- we -- we came into an open space. On the left of us was this open camp site with barbed wire, in which the Germans were standing or pacing. And there was one woman, whose name I think has been given as Irma Grace, but I\u2019m not sure if it was she, and I will check that for the record, but it was definitely a woman of -- who was well-known for her crimes. And -- and when the lorries stopped, and we were to get out and go and negotiate with the British post, the inmates, the German inmates started to chant. They realized that we had come for, in inverted commas, the Jews. And they began to chant, and it wasn\u2019t a very friendly chant. Something similar to do -- Jews, Jews, out with the Jews, but nasty stuff. I can\u2019t remember the exact words, but it was very ominous, and the whole scene was very ominous. And as we began to -- as we negotiated, and we received the people, and they were walking towards the truck, and we were loading them onto the trucks, the chanting got louder, and louder, and louder. And my colleague said, \u201cStart them singing, get them singing.\u201d And so they started to sing. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then you heard the marching toward the door that would open on the family in which the Germans would come. And you saw the family being beaten, being taken, you hear the screams, you see the mother being dragged away. The whole scene of a family being broken up in front of you was played time and time and time again. And it would be received in absolute silence. It was the homage to the family, to the destroyed family. Whether it was a form of mourning, I\u2019m not sure. It could -- it could have been. It was -- or was it more a kind of expression of outrage, letting the world know this is what happened to my family. I think it was more that than mourning, because it\u2019s my view that many Holocaust survivors have never found the way to mourn such grotesque happenings as those that they witnessed and were part of. So I think it\u2019s probably to do with -- to do with exposure of what happened, and wanting the world and everybody to see it. And as the military government and -- and officials from UNRRA were often invited to th -- these concerts. Not always, but -- but -- but especially so on some occasions, it\u2019s not surprising that they would want to say this. This 1s, or was my family, and this is how it was for me. It was incredibly intimate, and terrible to watch. And there was never any applause, there was only silence. But then there would be other things taking part. I don\u2019t remember all of it, but I remember that very often there would be a kind of cabaret element to it, in which there would be songs in Yiddish, or Polish, or whatever, really making fun of, and poking the finger at the establishment of the British rule, the British command and the British zone, the attitude to the camp. There would be  and it would be received with roars of laughter and applause, and at the end of which, of course, everybody stood up and applauded, including the front row of officials from the army, who\u2019d hadn\u2019t understood a word of this cabaret.

But the sense of not being wanted, and the sense of not being a victim again, was prevalent. And I have seen it elsewhere. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The one that you\u2019 ve just described.",

We were part of the res -- I don\u2019t want to use the word resurrection, but the -- part of the -- we saw ac - something of the restoration of the human spirit. We -- we vis -- we actually saw amongst the people, something of the spirit. Okay, they were angry, and they shouted, but they also laughed and performed, and -- and -- and were quite remarkable in many ways. I\u2019m not taking responsibility for it. I believe we played a small part in it, and I believe that we offered support and resources, and that probably, as is so often the case, we were responsible more for particular individuals being helped than we were for the kind of global picture, if you know what I mean. I mean, I can think of individuals, and I think of the German woman I spoke to, and who I had quite a lot to do with, and I think that without making too many claims, our relationship was helpful. The fact that she could speak to me about her husband, about her losses, and the fact that- no, I just feel somehow I can think of individuals that were helped by my colleagues, and on occasion by myself, but I don\u2019t want to make too many claims about what we achieved."

It wasn\u2019t a British hospital ostensibly, it was somehow manned by Jewish people helping Jewish people. And I think that was very important because you are very vulnerable when you are helpless. And they had been helpless many, many times, helpless victims at the mercy of others cruelty and lack of care, and lack of anything. And I think whatever else we did or didn\u2019t do, we did operate it well. I believe that. So I think that was a plus. And I -- I can think of many individuals who were helped along by something. But if you ask me were we responsible for all that renewal of -- of spirit and -- and so on, I don\u2019t think we were responsible. I think it came from the resilience of survivors.

Tell me how that process happened there in Belsen, as opposed to since.",

So you don\u2019t begin with words, you begin with touch, and that\u2019s all. And sometimes I would just walk away. And they might call me back or I might just walk away and come another day. But it would be -- I -- I found that was helpful in the very early days, because people were so exhausted, that to take somebody\u2019s hand and to hold it was a way of you -- you, as a person, trying to give strength, as it were, to the other person. So that was all I could do sometimes. Words came later."

So that 1t would come out stacat -- come out in -- in -- in -- in -- not clearly, not in a coherent way. And I would sometimes say either in German -- and I would always apologize for speaking German, and I would try to bring in Yiddish words that I\u2019d learned, as much as I could, if I couldn\u2019t understand somebody, because there would be other people there, and often people would sort of want to come to help you to understand the story. So that again is a form of communication. The fact that you don\u2019t understand puts you in a less powerful position, therefore they have the power to inform you. Without them, I can\u2019t understand that person. So that\u2019s always a very useful way of looking at things, to accept your powerlessness, and let them have the power to inform you.

How on earth did you live with this stuff day after day, and what sense did you have, had it been worthwhile, the day you just spent?",
            "answer": "I never talked to anyone about it, and I think that was one of the failures in the organization. It was born of it\u2019s time when organizations were not encouraged to speak about feelings, or things that they couldn\u2019t achieve. So that organizations -- and indeed they do it today, and the more difficult the outside circumstances, the more institutions call upon the solutions for the institutions rather than for the people they\u2019re there to help. So we would look at, if we met in the evening, we would talk about the difficulties of transport, or the difficulties of a car being stolen, or an accident. But we wouldn\u2019t talk about how I felt, or anybody else felt. So there wasn\u2019t much of that. What there was however, was a kind of group -- we would do all sorts of things in that house, that requisitioned house. We would sing, we would read poetry, we would read aloud to each other. We would put on various -- we had one boy who was an extremely good mimic, and Richard Talbor was a very popular tenor of the day, but dear Richard Talbor had a way of performing on the stage which was quite unique, and a little bit what can I say? Little bit arrogant and pompous. And he was wonderful at depicting Richard Talbor. And so he would sing and perform and we would all act out something. Or we would dance. Now we would This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We\u2019d put on something or other. We had some very sentimental Italian songs, you know -- you know, I can\u2019t even remember them now, but they were very sentimental, and we would all swoon, we would listen to music. So we -- we pu -- we had our own activities and we used each other very well I think, in the evenings, but we didn\u2019t talk about our feelings. So my main relief would be laughing at somebody taking off Richard Talbor or somebody else for that matter. And we\u2019d have all those sort of activities, which was fun."

            "question": "Privately, did you despair of what you were seeing day after day?",
            "answer": "No, I didn\u2019t despair at the time. When I came back to Britain, when I came back to London, I went through a very difficult phase, one that I haven\u2019t experienced since. I -- I can\u2019t explain what it was, it was an inability to work with what I\u2019d seen. I was absolutely terrified of a recurrence of that kind of happening, I was terrified of it. And I was sure that it was going to happen again. And I don\u2019t know why I felt that, but I felt afraid. And I used to go to the cinema and sit and watch film after film after film. And I had traditional, classical panic attacks, when I would feel overwhelmed with fear. So a lot of -- of the experience emerged much later, when I was -- when I had come home. And it was partly fostered by the lack of interest by anybody around me in understanding or listening to what I had to say. That was very difficult for me. I\u2019d learned a lot of negotiating skills in Germany, and in my family, but I hadn\u2019t learned how to deal, and I still find it hard to deal with a bystander, to deal with people who know and don\u2019t know, who don\u2019t want to hear, and who didn\u2019t want to hear. And I couldn\u2019t bear it. I came back to a country that was preoccupied with rationing, and which piece of meat they were going to get that week, and any effort I made on my part to communicate what I\u2019d seen, even when I was asked to give official talks about it -- I remember going to the east end and talking in a theater there to people.

I still do that sort of thing. And I had to ask for money and say what was going on, and I -- I mean, I met with cold, angry stares as much as to say, don\u2019t you think we\u2019ve suffered enough, we\u2019ve heard enough? But I think it\u2019s partly guilt. I know now that it\u2019s guilt. And so that before you start, you have to try to reduce that sense of guilt with people that they couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to do anything or know anything at the time. And they certainly didn\u2019t then. And I found that the hardest thing of all. So I despaired when I came back. I despaired when I came back, and I was really very low, the lowest I\u2019ve ever been in my life, I think. Well, almost."

And then finally, from there, I was asked to work with the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, working with a group of young children and adolescents who\u2019d been brought to this country whilst I was still in Germany.

I think we -- and I think that his support of the need for children to go to the sanatoria in -- in Switzerland was -- was good, and he gave me all the support -- moral support that I needed in order to do that. I think that he was misjudged, as is often the case, where you have a small -- where you have small resources, and you have a base in another country of purse holders and trustees, who have the reputation of the organization at heart, and want it to succeed, but do not, and cannot seem to have a view, a good overview of what Henry Lunzer was trying to achieve there. So there were inevitable, and there always are, I think, tensions, even in organizations today, which are well known, where the base is held perhaps here, and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the world. It\u2019s very difficult to keep those communications clean and good. And it certainly was a handicap in -- in the -- in the Jewish Relief Unit at that time."

            "question": "Okay. Let\u2019s talk then about the work that you did once you came back to London after the war.",
            "answer": "Once I\u2019d recovered my equilibrium, which took some months before I could actually face the world, really, I was appointed a case worker to the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps. I think I mentioned this a little earlier. It was an organization sponsored and financed by the Central British Fund, and had a board of trustees. And it\u2019s director was a practicing psychoanalyst, called Oskar Friedman, who I\u2019d admired very much. Who had been the director of a type of [indecipherable] institution in Germany, until he himself, as a Jew, was expelled and taken to a concentration camp before the war started, and finally released, and who came to this country, or at least came to Britain as a refugee. And he was, as I say, a practicing psychoanalyst, and he brought to the work of the committee, a knowledge of institutional life, and of working with people who in turn were trying to care for what was considered to be a -- in the best sense, perhaps, but nevertheless, a difficult or complex group of young people. I came back in 1947, in the early months of 1947, so the children had already been, and -- or -- and adolescents had already gone through a kind of preliminary phase of being 1n special homes, out of London, where they were helped with language and many different things. By the time I got to work with them, they were looking at schooling, at advance study, at apprenticeships, and some kind of future. Again, we were looking at a very vigorous, articulate, demanding group of young people, competitive. Now, they were very different in some ways from the people that I remembered from the camps. Their survival, as -- as had the people in the camps, but let\u2019s just make this kind of -- let\u2019s mark this difference. The people in -- the peop -- the pe -- the young This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Although of course, some were concerned with friends and siblings, but basically focused on their own bodily survival. They had to prove their strength, their capacity to work another day. Silence, not reacting to anything, however cruel, was part of their survival. So in dealing, in communicating with this group of people, one always had to have in one\u2019s mind that that was how they survived. And there was never going to be an easy, immediate communication and trust. There couldn\u2019t be. Nobody in their life really could be trusted for some time. So it was very important to find a way to build that trust, and to build a form of communication that took into account their need for their own private space. And this 1s quite important because I found it very important in working with them that -- for example, I -- I spoke about taking someone\u2019s hand in the camps. What I found with the young people to be very important was to pi -- allow a space between you and them. A kind of actual, physical space so that -- and I -- I could never quite put my finger on why, in the early days, that was so important to maintain that space, but it was. And I believe that it gave them a sense of their own kind of power base, their own sense of identity and strength. And I did not invade it.

            "question": "This is tape number four, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber. You were talking about the space and your approach -- you were talking about your approach to these young people, and how actually they needed precisely the opposite kind of approach to the people you dealt with in Belsen.",
            "answer": "Yes, yes. And a -- a -- this space was -- was a recognition, a kind of instinctive recognition. It wasn\u2019t something that I could put down to tuition or guidance from Oskar Friedman, although he was a guidance to me in many of the cases that I had. But I just -- it was something that I just sensed as very, very important. Now, my job then was to try and help the young people to be placed in jobs, to begin a life that would be possibly creative, or would certainly give them some sense of solid -- solidity. However, I have to say at some stage that we were not encouraged to, so to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they had experienced. And I do feel that there was, in some way, a denial of need here. I believe that these young people -- and I\u2019ve said earlier I believe, in the tapes, that people did not have the opportunity, the ability or the resources in time to mourn their dead. And it\u2019s not only to mourn their dead in the sense of their dying, but in the sense of their grotesque manner of dying. And to mourn the grotesque is more complex, and needs skill. I don\u2019t think that we had thought that through, and even if we did fumble towards an understanding that their inner world was not being addressed, such was the -- the kind of culture of the day, that the idea that -- you see, Britain at the end of the war was a country blunted by war, where the message to everyone was to -- to just put the past to rest and let\u2019s move forward. A new world is born, the war is over, let\u2019s get on with life. That was the message of the day. Soldiers were not encouraged to speak about their inner fears and their nightmares. They were not encouraged to talk about the horrors of war. All the war films that came out were really like This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So sentimental a -- you know, sa -- the war was sentimentalized. It wasn\u2019t portrayed at that stage with all it\u2019s horror. And to bring the horror of the Holocaust out in the open was felt not to be appropriate. Now, I\u2019m not saying that there wasn\u2019t some attention to their inner world. I believe there was some. The Anna Freud clinic was involved in some way in observing the young people. But I don\u2019t believe that we dealt with the need to mourn. And when I look today at the -- at the older people as they are now, men in their 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, women, and I look at their relationships and the next generation, I don\u2019t believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as we could have done. It\u2019s easy to say that in hindsight. I believe that we did quite a lot of good, and most of the young people have, in social terms, flourished, made good, married, had children. But if you observe them, and their relationships, and their long -- I don\u2019t want to use the word long-suffering, but in their very supportive wives, and you speak to the children, not everything is as good as it looks. So, I mean, I went about my task of trying to help people, young people t -- into jobs. I negotiated yet again with schools, and colleges, and institutions and most in a -- most unpleasant sometimes, landlords, landladies, and -- and -- and -- and employers. It was a hard time. It had been a hard war, and people were tough, and employers were tough. And the fact that these young people were -- I was just going to say asylum seekers -- were -- as the young people were Holocaust survivors, it did not call for compassion. Some were good, some were very good. And many people worked well with the young people, and offered much. And there was a club, and there were facilities and money was sought for special needs. But I would have liked to have dealt better with some of the strange things that happened. I had a young man, for example, who\u2019d been -- who had TB. And I went every week to see him here, in a sanatorium near Brentwood. He was a delightful young man from Poland. We spoke together, we talked about his needs.

But one day when I went there, after many, many months of treatment, and he was doing very well, he wasn\u2019t there. And I was quite upset and I asked the nurses what had happened. And they said he just got up and went. Now he -- we don\u2019t know what happened, and I still to this day don\u2019t know exactly what the process was, whether it was long planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or what, but certainly Oskar Friedman was very enquiring of me as to why I hadn\u2019t noticed a problem. But such was the defense of this young man that he could converse week after week, and I could become quite close, and we could talk about quite intimate things, about sexuality, about the difficulty of being ill, about a possible girlfriend, all these things we could talk about. But somehow he could, nevertheless, just g-get up and go. So it\u2019s that kind of thing where the defenses have been developed through crisis, through extremis, through the most terrible losses and catastrophes, and genocide. Where people have built defenses that are no longer so good in every day life, and do not make for absolute intimacy and trust. And this is what I think happened with this young man. We ca -- w-we managed to speak about it later, but it happened, and it felt like a failure, and was judged to be a failure."

            "answer": "I worked for many years, about eight years on and off with the -- the boy survivors. Of course, there were girls, we always called them the boys, but there were girls. And I continue to stay in touch with them. When I say I continue to work with them, the work finished probably after a -- a few years, I think, after about four years, but I continued to see them, and continued to work with them for a number of years after that. And I still see them, particularly one or two of them. But I then went on to do some hospital jobs, social work jobs in hospitals. I joined Amnesty in 1961. And I -- I just do want to say something about why I joined Amnesty, I know it\u2019s not relevant, except to do with hatred. It was very easy to hate one particular nation, and one particular group of people. And I\u2019d enjoyed, if I can use that word, or indulged in that hatred for many years, particularly as my husband also had been a s -- a survivor in many ways, and seen his family destroyed in grotesque ways, and I -- at least his -- certainly his father, who was beaten to death in the house in which they were on the Kristallnacht. So living with his depression and his misery over the death of his mother, and rest of his family in Majdanek concentration camp, I certainly nursed my hatred of the Germans for many years. But it was when I began to realize that torture and other human rights violations were going on in so many countries in the world. That the French were torturing the Algerians, that other people were torturing. That you could not put -- you could not put a frontier up and say this is where it begins, and this is where it ends.

The Holocaust will always remain the most terrible of genocides of the\" century. But I still feel that we mustn\u2019t close our eyes to other terrible disasters, such as we\u2019 ve seen recently, for example, in Rwanda. So I joined Amnesty [indecipherable] in the spirits, you know, with the idea that I can\u2019t nurse this forever. I have to accept and have to understand that violence and persecution goes on in many different forms, and I needed to understand it better. My work in Amnesty went on for many years. I -- I helped to form the first medical group in the British section of Amnesty International, taking testimony and documenting evidence of torture and human rights violations from relatives and survivors who\u2019d come to this country, and in going on missions abroad for Amnesty. And it was coming out of that -- that work, knowing that we could document, and we could take testimony, and we could supply evidence of human rights violations to organizations and institutions concerned with human rights, including the United Nations, but that we weren\u2019t actually treating the survivors. That made me feel we weren\u2019t really fulfilling our task. And as people were beginning to ask us to take care of asylum seekers, refugees and asylum seekers from many different countries who look -- resided 1n this country, and who\u2019d been tortured and violated in many different ways, and lost sometimes, all their members of their family, that made me feel that we needed to move on. We established as an independent charity, the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture at the end of 1985. And we had a vision, and visions are difficult to hold onto. And the vision was to combine human rights, and the care of the victims. In other words, to take heed of people\u2019s protection, their human rights, to be part of that. If necessary even to be advocates for that, which is not easy for therapists. But also to look at the medical, psychological and social needs of the people who came from the -- to the medical foundation. We\u2019ve treated over 35,000 people, from over 91 different countries, and I have to tell you that my room every day, my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And I suppose really, that is the beginning and end, in some ways of my story. I\u2019m doing what I set out to do. I know I can\u2019t save everybody. I know that my own skills are limited. We\u2019re an organization with no -- insufficient resources to meet the needs of everyone. I believe we live in as hostile an environment as -- or at least our survivors do, as they ever did in the 30\u2019s. People are not welcomed, people are deported back to the countries which tortured them. European countries are closing the doors, we have a fortress Europe. We don\u2019t look for good solutions. We didn\u2019t in the 30\u2019s and we don\u2019t now. So really, my work is again about human rights, and the care of the individual, and the individual\u2019s family.

What I learned in Belsen was about a kind of suffering that we have never really begun to understand, about loss, about grotesque death, about the need to mourn. About -- about despair and the desire to die. I learned all of these things in Belsen, but I also learned about the resilience, and something about the human spirit and people\u2019s capacity to survive, and people\u2019s capacity to overcome, if you are able to resource something within them.

You\u2019ll have to listen to what is going to help them, and you have to find very creative ways of working with people, and I can give many examples of that, but I don\u2019t think that that is the purpose of this discussion. I think the Medical Foundation has learned how to address government, it\u2019s home office. It doesn\u2019t always succeed, but it tries. It\u2019s learned skills of negotiation and understanding other people\u2019s difficulties. But how you hold the vision, and how you deal with continuing -- a continuing lack of compassion and understanding, both in the public -- or some of the public, not all of the public, we have quite a following, but in some of the public, and in some of government, is very difficult to do."

So it seemed a logical thing to do, for us to attend the conference, which regrettably was on the subject of torture. Torture worldwide, torture throughout the world, but torture also in Israel. And when I was there, I was asked by the Physicians for Human Rights if I would help them in the case of a Palestinian where it had become obvious from the papers that had been found of his interrogation, that he had been tortured in order -- in order for him to confess, whether I will be prepared to help them. And I met the lawyer, the Jewish lawyer involved in his case before I made any decisions. And I was very impressed with his integrity, and his dignity, and his desire as an Israeli to provide fairness and justice where he felt 1t was appropriate. On reading the document, it was obvious to me that certain forms of what we would call torture had taken place. And I agreed, reluctantly may I say, to, as a visiting director of an organization concerned with torture, to take part in a certain aspect of his trial. It -- it was agreed -- it was agreed with the lawyer that this -- I mean, it was at the lawyers request that I acquiesced to this. And I produced a document, and I attended the court.

So, my role was rather a limited one. But I could talk about confessions under torture, and that confessions under torture can never be reliable ones, for quite obvious reasons. That people will often say something in extreme discomfort that isn\u2019t necessarily true. And as torture is universally outlawed, it does seem rather inappropriate for any court to take, to accept a confession that actually took place under coercion, and under extreme pressure. Before I went to the court, I sat for some time in a very small, hot flat, without air conditioning, to see what it felt like to be hooded with a thick, smelly, kind of wooly, wool material, army material hood. I didn\u2019t have such an exact hood, but I had sufficient to give me a feeling of how claustrophobic, and how terrible such a feeling would be. I wasn\u2019t able to adopt the position that 1s adopted, that was adopted, and is -- is often used in such cases in Israel, where somebody is placed on a low chair, their hands tied behind them, and the chair\u2019s feet are shorter in the front than the back, so that the -- when you are hooded, and exposed to quite a lot of noise, loud noise, and you are also in this very uncomfortable position, sitting on this seat, which has a traditional name, which I shall remember soon, I think if anybody were to try that position, they would find it extremely uncomfortable, because the weight of the body is distributed in such a way that there\u2019s enormous pressure on the back, and one is in extreme discomfort and fear, and exposed to noise. Man also had an injury that had been recorded in the notes, but which I was not allowed to refer to in the court, which was an injury to his nose, which the doctor had recorded. Now, I -- it\u2019s difficult for me to discuss this particular case. It so happens that the case was resolved, inasmuch as an expert came from -- an expert in confessions under pers -- under duress, came from the Mordsley hospital as an independent expert, and gave evidence in this case."

For me, with my background, to stand in Israeli court, defending a Palestinian, who was there, and who looked extremely fearful, and obviously with a -- some - well, was very hard. But it was much harder to do nothing. If had done nothing, I could never really have lived with my principles, which is that nobody, under any circumstances should be signaled out for torture, and that there are other ways. If you do want information, you have to find, with all the ingenuity that exists within societies, other ways. But you do not torture, you do not torture. Torture is such an abominable, devastating experience, both to those who practice it, I believe, in the end, and those on who it 1s inflicted.

But my views are clear, and my experience of working with survivors 1s that they- they do not -- it is very difficult to overcome, just as it is with Holocaust survivors to overcome the effects of torture. And for -- to employ people to torture as your agents is, I think the s -- beginning of a very slippery slope. If you employ people to torture, or to apply as they say, minimum pressure, or whatever the phrase is. It doesn\u2019t matter what the phrase is. What it means is to frighten through physical and psychological pain into a confession. It\u2019s no way to behave for a civilized society.

And I have been witness to a number of testimonies of people who\u2019ve been tortured. And it\u2019s an unbearable thought, but I think that we have to -- I take heart from the fact that there are people in Israel who are working very, very hard to find a way to end this, and who\u2019ve spoken out very courageously. I wish there were more. I know that there\u2019s a great deal of fear, but I don\u2019t with to get into the political scene in Israel.

I\u2019ve worked with moderate, and intelligent, and caring Palestinians and Israelis who come together and want to bring about change, and it\u2019s our job to help them do that.

I think it\u2019s so easy to turn against people, to create scapegoats. I mean, no -- no nation, no group of people can be more conscious of that than the Jewish people, how easy it is for them to be scapegoated. They always have been, and they\u2019re still being scapegoated. But we have to be careful about this, and we have to be informing all the time, people about the need to understand other people, to be compassionate. We\u2019re not a compassionate society here or anywhere else that I can see. And we can do so many things. We\u2019re now going off to Mars, and to the moon, and here and there, but we don\u2019t know how to maintain compassion. What I saw happen in Belsen was the dying of compassion. There was outrage and compassion when the camp was liberated, but I watched it die. I watched it not there when I came back. And when I speak today to people -- I watched it in hospitals where children, in my view, were really abused, and restrained, when they should not have been. I don\u2019t mean -- when I say abused, I mean cruelly treated, really. Stupidly treated. I just -- I just -- I mean, for example, when the Kosovan refugees came to this country -- we can question why, but people came to the airports with teddy bears and presents, and there was all kinds of support and interest in their welfare, particularly families with small children. People were able to identify them. But even though they were able to identify them, the compassion is gone. If I say today that my own government is considering sending back a Kosovan family, who we feel, for reasons of torture and rape and various other situations, really should not go back, but should be allowed to stay, there won\u2019t be that compassion. The compassion has died. And so I don\u2019t know what maintains compassion. And I don\u2019t know how to help people or to instill compassion in people when they\u2019ve lost it.
