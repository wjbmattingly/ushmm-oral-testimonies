I \u2014 when I came back from my aunt, near Krakow, where I spend the vacation, she brought me around sixth or fifth of August.

And then we hear some of the bombs breaking sound, and the \u2014 the conductor of the tramway said, you have to hurry home and try to get into the basement or somewhere to hide, because this is the \u2014 we are attacked from the air by Germany. I remember then walking back, I saw a woman \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I remember that, but carrying a pillow with blood on it. And she said my daughter was hit by \u2014 whether by shrapnel, or whether by a brick or something, because of the falling house, that her \u2014 her head was on that pillow when her daughter was, and she was crying and carrying before we got to our house.
