The junior high school and high school and I got my baccalaureate. What is it called? Finish of high school, the big exam. There was an oral exam and a written exam. The oral exam -- they were communists, of course, and you couldn\u2019t say anything about ---. You had to say, you had to lie. They twisted history a lot and you had to go along with that, otherwise they failed you. And it was a very tough exam, a whole day exam. I remember my mother fasting on that day because we knew we were trying to get out and she wanted me to have that document with me. I passed it and then there was years until we got the visa for, the transit visa for Hungary and Austria but the exit visa expired. So we went for two years until finally it happened. We took a lot of our stuff, like some china and some crystal that were in the family for a long, long time and we shipped it to Israel to my aunt. That\u2019s how come I have these -- whatever pictures I have. Because when we left Bucharest, we were told that youll come crawling back and you don\u2019t even need anything to take with you. They examined my teeth and the hair for diamonds and for whatever. My father buried a lot of stuff. They now have a refrigerator factory there so there\u2019s no chance of going to get that. We came out and went to Switzerland first and my father got some money out from what he had long before the war. If we didn\u2019t This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

We bought some clothes and we tried to go to consulates, to get a visa. Switzerland only gave you so much stay and you couldn\u2019t stay any longer and they would not prolong it. So we came to Italy. In Italy we went to the American embassy and they informed us that we can\u2019t get a visa. We lived in Italy for eight months."

            "answer": "In Milano. We traveled through a lot of this -- whenever an embassy was . There was a question of Costa Rica or Cuba or Venezuela or whatever. My father, deep inside him, was hoping that the Russians would go away and he would be able to go back."

According to my father\u2019s cousin in America; he said that\u2019s the closest, forty minutes. So you wait a couple of weeks and then you\u2019ll come here. A couple of weeks turned out to be ---."

            "answer": "So we chose Cuba. We went to the Cuban embassy in Italy and we got our visa. Then he was holding off. Every time we go to check when there\u2019s a boat to Cuba, he said, there\u2019s no boat to Cuba. He thought maybe they\u2019ll go away, maybe we\u2019 ll be able ---. He just ---. We wanted to go to Israel and we were advised not to. We went through a lot so much already and I mean, \u201948; the State was born in \"48. This was \u00b047 and there was a lot of things going on there and so finally, he couldn\u2019t hold anymore and we took a boat. We went to Cuba. We had falsified papers in Italy, I want you to know, from the Romanian government \u2014in-exile because we only had a visa for 30 days and it came, what, eight months we stayed there. So they kept falsified on our passport, that we have. We got a Cuban visa and a false Romanian visa. Even the language was not correct because they were a government-in-exile. They forgot how to speak Romanian from King Michael\u2019s. So we got our Cuban visa and we came to Cuba. We stayed in Cuba and waited and waited."

The biggest hurricanes, that was Cuba. Then we came here to the United States and my father again went into a different business. He -- his cousin was in knitwear so he worked with him for a while and then he opened a wholesale store, down on Ludlow Street. He was selling to stores and he was manufacturing himself. In other words, not manufacturing but contracting; sweaters and all kinds of knitwear. Then he had a heart attack and died."

I met Charlie on a blind date. Never knew what a blind date was, always wanted to know. Because in Cuba, there were 8,000 Jews in Cuba and everybody knew everybody, if not intimately, but of everybody. Nobody knows what it means to have it like that, that was it. Now are you going to behave Charlie or do you want me to talk for you or what? {Male voice: Pll do my best}. Pull yourself together and just.
