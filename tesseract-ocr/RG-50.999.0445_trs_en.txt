>> Bill Benson: Good afternoon, and welcome to the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum. My name is Bill Benson, and | am the host of
the museum's public program, First Person. Thank you for joining us. We
are in our 14th year of First Person. Our First Person today is Mr. Manny
Mandel, whom we shall meet shortly.

This 2013 season of First Person is made possible through the
generosity of the Louis Franklin Smith Foundation to whom we are grateful
for again sponsoring First Person.

First Person is a series of weekly conversations with survivors of the
Holocaust who share with us their firsthand accounts of their experience
during the Holocaust. Each of our guests serves as a volunteer here at this
museum. We will continue our program through the middle of August. Each
of our guests, you can go to the website at www.ushmm.org and it provides
information about each of our upcoming First Person guests.

Manny will share with us his First Person account of his experience
during the Holocaust and as a survivor, for about 45 minutes. If we have an
opportunity toward the end of the program, you will have a chance to ask him
a few questions.

The life stories of Holocaust survivors transcend the decades. What
you are about to hear from Manny is one individual's account of the
Holocaust. We have prepared a brief slide presentation to help with his

introduction.

We begin with this portrait of Manny Mandel. Manny was born to a
religious Jewish family on May 8, 1936, in Riga, Latvia. Manny was just 3
when World War II started. Though he was born in Riga, Latvia, Manny's
family were Hungarian Jews. They moved briefly to Latvia because of his
father's work. Here we see a portrait of Manny's parents, Yehuda Mandel,
holding their infant son Manny.

Shortly after Manny's birth, his father accepted a post as a chief cantor
in Budapest and the family returned to Hungary, where they had lived before
1933. Hungary is highlighted on this map of Europe. Budapest is highlighted
on this map of Hungary.

Manny's father was based at the renowned Rombach Synagogue. In
this picture, we see Manny and his father on a street in Budapest.

The Hungarian government passed anti-Jewish laws beginning in
1938. In 1940, Hungary joined the Axis Alliance, and in 1941 Hungarian
troops participated alongside German troops in the invasion of the Soviet
Union. The war and increasing restrictions made life for juice in Hungary
increasingly difficult. The photo on the left shows Manny outside his
apartment on his first day of school in 1942 in Budapest. On the right we see
a contemporary photo of Manny standing outside the same apartment.

German forces occupied Hungary in March of 1944. Manny and his

mother Ella were fortunate to be included in a program where Jews would be
transported to Palestine in exchange for trucks. Within a month, they were
transported by the Nazis to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near
Hannover, Germany, in preparation for the eventual departure from Europe.
This photo is of the Bergen-Belsen camp.

Negotiations for their transport to Palestine broke down and in
December of 1944, about six months before the end of the war, Manny and
his mother were released from Bergen-Belsen and transported to safety in
neutral Switzerland. There they stayed at the Heiden Children's Home,
which is pictured here, where Ella worked as a teacher. Manny is lying down
in the front on your left. His mother Ella is standing in the back, in the middle.

After the war, Manny and his mother reunited with his father in Israel.
They subsequently emigrated to the United States and lived in Philadelphia.
Manny is a graduate of Temple University and did his graduate work at the
University of Pennsylvania. He is a clinical social worker. He met his future
wife, Adrienne, in Philadelphia and they were married in 1958. They have
been married for 55 years.

After working for the B'Nai B'Rith Youth Organization in Cleveland and
in Michigan, Manny and Adrienne moved to Washington, DC where Manny
became the national program director for the B'Nai B'Rith. He would later go
to work for the Peace Corps before beginning his own psychotherapy

practice in 1980. Manny continues his independent practice today.
Adrienne's many accomplishments include having served in the Maryland
Legislature as an elected member of the House of Delegates. She is
presently a member of the Board of Commissioners of the Washington
Suburban Sanitary Commission, the nation's eighth largest water and
wastewater utility. Manny and Adrienne live in Silver Spring, Maryland. They
have two children and three grandchildren. Their daughter Lisa has a
24-year-old son, Zachary, who graduated from the University of Maryland,
and a 21-year-old daughter, Gabrielle, a University of Michigan senior.
Manny and Adrienne's son David has a soon-to-be 16-year-old daughter,
Alexandra, who is presently in a summer Bolshoi Ballet Program at Julliard in
New York. She will be a high school junior this year. I'm pleased to say that
Adrienne is here today with Manny, as are their children, Lisa and David. If
you wouldn't mind raising your hands. Great. Thank you.

Manny speaks regularly about his Holocaust experience in various
settings such as schools and synagogues. He volunteers at the museum
and leads tours about genocide in the learning center where you will find him
every other Friday. Manny celebrated his 77th birthday on May 8. With that,
I'd like you to join me in welcoming our First Person, Mr. Manny Mandel.
Manny?

Manny, thank you so much. Thank you so much for joining us, for your
willingness to be our First Person today. We have a great deal for you to
cover in just an hour. We'll just jump right in. You were born in Riga, Latvia,
in 1936, but your family stayed and certain yours was a short one before you
moved to Budapest, Hungary. War began in Europe with the invasion of
Poland by the Germans in 1939, September 1, when you were 3. Before we
turn to the war years, tell us what you can about your family, their life, in your
very early life before the war began.
>> Manny Mandel: Well, are we on? Yes. People often ask me how come |
was born in Riga when my family is ethnically Hungarian. | usually respond
by saying there's a rule that says you must be born where your mother is.
[Laughter]
And interestingly enough, part of the reason we were in Riga had something
to do tangentially with the later-on Holocaust issues. Bill mentioned that
some of the enforcement of the anti-Jewish, anti-Semitic laws in Hungary
was in 1938, but something called the Numerus Clausus, which were the
anti-Jewish laws in Hungary, began in the 1920's, about 10 years before the
Germans started the Nuremberg Laws in 1933.

As a consequence, because of the nature of Europe, let me tell you
what that was. My father is from eastern Hungary, born in the
Austro-Hungarian empire's days in 1904. When he was 18 years old, he was

drafted into the Czech Army, because after the First World War, this is 1922,
Czechoslovakia had been created. For those of you who remember, it was
created after the First World War. So my father's now in the Czech Army,
he's a Czech citizen.

As a Czech citizen, when he finished his training in Vienna in 1927 or
so, he was looking for a job in Hungary. They would not give him papers.
First, he was a Czech citizen and a Jew. The laws that were enforced made
him unable to get a position that he wanted in continental Hungary.

He did a number of investigations as to where to go and found a job,
which was very much in demand, it was in Riga. Went there in 1933. In
1936 | was born. By that time, he was able to get the papers required for him
to go to Hungary and he goes to Hungary in 1936, has a job in the Rombach
Synagogue that Bill mentioned and he thinks he has just reached heaven on
earth, because it's the job that he wanted and the place that he wanted,
ethnically Hungarian.

lf not for the fellow with the little mustache, you remember him, he
would have been there, | would never have come here to talk to you in First
Person. That's how we wind up in Riga.
>> Bill Benson: You told me a story that your mother had recounted along
the lines of someone saying, well, today you now speak Yugoslavian.

>> Manny Mandel: My mother comes from southern Hungary. This is part of
the Austro-Hungary empire, which was chopped up after the war. Southern
Hungary, better known as Yugoslavia, today known as Serbia. Illustration,
her hometown is Novi Sad. It doesn't matter. My mother told the story after
the First World War ended, Yugoslavia is created in 1918, she's 10 years
old, they come into school, they say OK, tomorrow, we're going to change
language. They'd been studying Hungarian. The language to be changed to
was Serbo-Croatian. These two languages don't have a syllable, period or
comma that are similar. They were bilingual. The kids said fine. The point is
this was not unusual in Europe. My father, through his career, probably was
conversant in probably eight languages. He was nota linguist. But you
heard some here, some there, some someplace else, and you used these.

Part of the reason my mother, you saw the picture in Heiden,
the children's camp, after we were taken out of Germany on this barter basis,
20 Hungarian kids were sent to this children's home in Heiden, in the German
part of Switzerland. They wanted to send somebody along who could speak
for the kids and to the other people in the place. The other people included
the director, who is on the picture, they were all German or French speaking.
My mother had very good German. And acceptable French. From school.
She had been a schoolteacher before she was married. She was the likely
choice. As a consequence, here she is, speaks Hungarian to us, German

and French to the rest of the people, and in Europe this was as routine as
going to have 7-Up at McDonald's.
>> Bill Benson: You lived in Hungary, and war began in September 1939,
but the full effect would not come to your community until 1944. Yet, there
were many difficult times in those intervening years. Before we move to that
period, once it really hit home to you in 1944, tell us what life was like once
the war began in Europe for you and your family living in Budapest.
>> Manny Mandel: Life for me as a child was fine. For two reasons. You
need to know, those who have studied anything about the Holocaust, have
gone through this museum, the experience of Hungary was unique. Because
aside from Italy, and of course Japan, about which we're not speaking, that's
a different part of the world, Hungary was an ally. As a consequence the
impact of the German occupation, the impact of the SS, of all things German,
did not happen in Hungary. Hungary was ruled by a region and a political
party called the Arrow Cross, which was the Hungarian equivalent of the Nazi
party. But on a day-to-day basis, people went to work, came home from
work, went to the movies, and people ate lunch.

What I'm saying, in many ways, until almost 1944, the impact on
Hungary is almost unfelt. Well, not quite. We want to remember that the
Holocaust takes place in the middle of an even larger conflagration Called
World War Il. We are bombed almost every night. On one side come the

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

western allies, on the other side the Russians. They're bombing Budapest,
because it is an enemy capital. Well, people living in Budapest, Jews,
non-Jews, anybody else, were affected by this bombing. Budapest was not
quite destroyed as much as Warsaw was or Hamburg or Dresden was. It
was a Significant impact. Other than that, much of the impact did not affect
the child.

Well, | take that back. | went to first grade, you don't see in the
picture, | went to first grade with a star on my coat. Jews had to wear a
yellow star. Those of you who have gone through the museum or will do so
will see samples of these stars. In certain places they're being displayed,
pictures and actually actual stars. The star that | saved until after the war
was lost when we came to this country, unfortunately, for reasons that are
totally unrelated. We came here by plane, not ship, in 1949. On the plane,
you can only carry very few things. | left that star and some other important
papers of mine with an aunt in then-Israel, who was going to ship it to us
afterwards. She changed houses. My important papers and star
disappeared. | never forgave myself, but that's life.
>> Bill Benson: You described in some ways, as a very young child, the
wearing of the star, it made you feel the same as the adults, because they
had to wear the stars. So it had a different impact on you from that
perspective. Can you say more about that?

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection
>> Manny Mandel: | thought that being 6 years old, 7 years old with a star,
exactly as Bill says, made me an adult, and that made me very proud. Let
me tell you very briefly at this point | began to realize maybe this is nothing to
be proud of. The rule was that you had to wear that star on your outer
garment, outside of the house. If you didn't, the consequence was being
shot. That's all. On the spot or somewhere else. Very simple.

The rules were simple. As long as you lived within those rules, there
was no problem. | thought that was great. Until | was about 7 or so, | said to
my father, | outgrew my tricycle. I'd like to have a bicycle. A small-size
bicycle. To which my father said fine, no problem getting the bicycle, except
two reasons, minor and a major, which will prevent me from getting you a
bicycle. The minor was we live on the fifth floor of the apartment. We had an
elevator. The elevator was a 50-year-old elevator. Frequently was out of
service. The parts to repair the elevator were made in the same factory that
was making munitions, guns and things. Elevator parts were very low on the
priority for mechanical kind of engineering.

So the elevator is one. My father said | have to trek the bicycle
down -- in Europe you didn't ride the bicycle in your backyard. Nobody had
backyards. Go to the street, to the park, you ride the bicycle, come back. I'm
willing to do that. That's very small.

The larger issue is if you ride the bike in the park with the yellow star

and you're out of my sight for 12 seconds, somebody might decide to hit you
on the head and take the bike or hit you on the head and leave the bike, as
long as they can hit you, because that yellow star is a magnet of certain
behaviors. That I'm not willing to risk.

| was very upset. The yellow star cost me a bike. At 7 | had a difficult
time putting those two things together. | can tell you in 1949, when | was 13,
we lived in New York. Not the first day we arrived, but within a very short
time, my parents said this afternoon we're going to the store. What are we
going to buy? A bicycle.
>> Bill Benson: What were some of the other restrictions that were imposed
on Jews at that time?
>> Manny Mandel: Several. One day the man comes to the door, says we
must take your telephone. There's nothing anti-Semitic about phones. That
was a restriction.

Next time, now, remember, that in Europe living in those days there
was -- we all had washing machines, dryers, freezers, dish washers, and all
the other stuff, except they were called a maid.

My mother and the maid were the dishwasher, the dryer, the washer,
the other things. This was routine in a middle class family. Had nothing to
do with being aristocratic. The maid was my buddy, a young woman from the
hinterlands. Closer to me in age. 18,1 was 6, 7, 8. That was my buddy. In

the daytime, when | was in school, she was home.

They told us that the maid had to go. Why? Jews could not have
maids. You survived these things somehow. My mother did more work. |
don't know how she managed it, but there were three of us. Much of the time
only two of us, because one of the consequences of being under this kind of
rule was something called the slave labor camps. This is not what you see
upstairs in the museum about being taken away into camps. The Hungarian
male population was conscripted into the army. It was called the draft. In
this room, | don't see too many people who would know anything about the
draft, which in this country was eliminated some time ago.

The point still remains that the draft took men into the army.

Hungarian military forces fought in Russia with the Germans. To replace
these Hungarian men with labor, they conscripted battalions of Hungarian
Jews, my father being one of them. In 19 whatever, 1940, he was 36 years
old, a young man, strong as an ox. He and all of his colleagues and doctors,
lawyers, Indian chiefs who had absolutely no knowledge of physical labor
were conscripted to do mining, road repair, crater repair. My father would get
a phone call, letter, or visit that would say on Tuesday at 3:00 you are to
appear at this train station. You will be gone for a day, two, five,
undetermined period of time. So for 3, 4, 3 1/2 years my father was out of
the house, much as a traveling salesman. | didn't miss him after all, because

he wasn't home. It was routine for not being there. The fact that he wasn't
there meant | grew up for those three years without a father.

It also meant my mother's work was less, because she was only taking
care of herself and me. The maid was gone. My father wasn't home. My
father's youngest brother, who was named David, after whom we named our
son, David, he was a university student. Restrictions? He was the last
graduate at the university in Budapest with a star on his chest. When he was
called into these labor camps after he finished school in 1943, he threw a fit.
My grandmother, who was visiting, fainted. It was unusual for David to go
into the labor camp. But my father, routine. They were 10 years apart in
age. So my father was 36, he was maybe 26.
>> Bill Benson: Manny, you also mentioned that there is the larger context of
the war going on, so there was bombings and other deprivations. What was
your food situation?
>> Manny Mandel: If you recall the pictures at the very beginning, my father
is in the big furry coat with the hat. Coming home from the market.
Obviously, it was home at the time.

| have absolutely no recollection of food being a problem in any
fashion, but perhaps there was some rationing. My wife, who grew up -- my
wife is a survivor also, of New Jersey.

She loves it when | say it. My wife tells me that during the war, we're the
same age, there were rationing, certain things here, butter was restricted,
gasoline was restricted. | don't think that we experienced restrictions in
Budapest at the time that were any more severe than those restrictions.
| have no recollection of food being a problem. Although, it's
interesting to me that my grandparents, who lived in Novi Sad, had a
backyard where they lived, and they began to raise a couple of chickens and
a rooster. They were not farmers, but there was some land, all fenced-in
area. | remember they either brought or sent a bird. Maybe for holiday time.
It isn't because we were starving, but there was perhaps some more difficult
time. After all, the war is going on. Everybody has a little less of all the good
things. Basically, food was not a problem, as | can recall it at that time.
>> Bill Benson: Manny, in December of 1941, | believe it was, might have
been Novi Sad, you went to visit your aunt.
>> Manny Mandel: My grandparents.
>> Bill Benson: There you encountered a truly horrific experience. Please
share that with us.
>> Manny Mandel: Sometimes the questions are asked what was my first
experience with the Holocaust and | tell this story. The star was something.
The bicycle was another. But this is different. This is earlier. This is 1941,
5 1/2 years old. Visiting Novi Sad, the visit wintertime, my grandparents.

There were also two aunts, my mother's two sisters lived in Novi Sad. They
never left.

We're staying at the apartment of one of my aunts, been there two,
three days, somebody comes up the stairs, says, "There's something going
on outside. Somebody will surely be coming in to tell you about it." Within
five minutes, two policemen come upstairs. In the most courteous way say
please, ladies and gentlemen, get dressed warmly, you need to be outside.
We're going to conduct a census.

We know that the census in this country takes place every 10 years.
The census in Europe during the war under any kind of German controlled
occupation took place about every 15 minutes.

They felt if they know precisely where everybody is at all times, it
helps to control the situation.

Census. We didn't think anything of it. We got dressed warmly.
Wintertime. It wasn't a bitter, terrible day. Go outside, told to turn left by the
apartment and walk in that direction.

We did. We walked. My mother carrying, my father carrying, now
5 1/2 years old. | don't remember that to be in any way a difficult time. It was
a little chilly, but nothing serious.

Until we arrived at a place where | recognized. I'll tell you in a minute
why. A fence in on left, told to walk along this fence. Slowly. Advancing

forward. By this time, my grandparents came and some others, huddled
together, a dozen, 18 people, friends, relatives, acquaintances, marching in
that direction.

| recognize the place because in Europe, in cities which are not on the
ocean but are on a river, most of the capitals, if you think, are on rivers, for
obvious reasons. They created these very lovely beaches. This is the
Danube river that flows through Novi Sad. Famous non-blue Danube. And
you are along this fence, and inside the fence in the summertime are wave
pools and heated pools and thermal pools and all kinds of restaurants. It's a
very lovely place. It's a beach.

Winter, when it's frozen, the river is frozen and the places shut down.
| recall from the previous summer, my parents recalled it from being there
many, many times when they lived in Novi Sad before they went to Riga.
They met in Novi Sad.

We're marching along, as we're marching, slowly ambling forward, we
notice that the big gates of this place are open. People are told to go there,
turn left into the gates. To the best of my knowledge then and since | never
knew why we were there, but | knew what happened, but not why we were
there.

As we begin to approach these gates, there's a policeman standing on
the right side. He says to my father, "Mister, what are you doing here?"

ROUGH DRAFT TRANSCRIPT
NOT A VERBATIM RECORD

Contact reference@ushmm org for further information about tis collection .

He says I'm here visiting family. | don't mean that. That's your
business. You don't belong here. You're not from Novi Sad. You and the
crowd you're with if they get counted in the census, it will mess up the
numbers. You're from Budapest. How do | know that? I'm a traffic
policeman two blocks from your apartment. I've seen you dozens of times. |
recognize you.

Saved our lives. Why? He said to us step aside. We get out of this
census thing that he thought was going on. Maybe he knew better. As we
step aside, within moments of this a staff car comes down the road, they
have a powwow, and somebody gets on the bullhorn says, ladies and
gentlemen, the requirements of the census have been met. There's a school
right over there. There's hot coffee and chocolate. Please have some and
go home.

What we didn't know, until later that night my parents found out, and
the next day, | didn't find out, | certainly didn't understand it till much later,
everybody who turned left in those gates was marched about 300 yards to
the Danube, where the ice had been chopped open, were shot. Their bodies,
if they were found, were found next March when the river thawed.

Ladies and gentlemen, | just described to you a pogrom, senseless,
meaningless, useless exercise in power that you can perpetrate because you
can.

Something happened in some village where the partisans, these were
the guerilla outfits, did something, and in order to make a point of saying
don't do that, they killed 350 people. That was my first experience with the
Holocaust. Those going through the museum, or have been through, you
may become familiar with a much larger pogrom of a similar type, where the
area was enormous. It was called Kristallnacht, in German "The Night of
Broken Glass."
>> Bill Benson: The staff car that came along and actually stopped this event
from occurring was, as | recall, a German staff car. It had been Hungarians
that had been doing the census, pushing people into the Danube. It seems
ironic that Germans would have stopped that from taking place. Do you
know why?
>> Manny Mandel: No. Apparently, what happened, this had been not a
one-day process. But the German leadership had the most peculiar sets of
inconsistency. They would stop something, because somebody decided they
should.

By the same way, we got out of Hungary, you mentioned the
group we were with, because we produced papers and claimed to be
displaced persons. Folks, | was about as displaced in Hungary at the time
with my mother -- not my father, he survived, an entirely different story -- |
was about as displaced as | am in this chair. If you have triple stamps and

Raoul Wallenberg, if you look outside, 14th street is one side, the other is
Raoul Wallenberg Place, named after the Swedish diplomat who issued
thousands of passes. They were as phony as $3 bills. There was this
inconsistency. For some reason nobody precisely knows, they said enough.
There's no rhyme, reason, or logic.
>> Bill Benson: You were able to return to Budapest after that?
>> Manny Mandel: The next morning at 6:00. Here is an interesting point,
my recollection. | thought it was an adventure. My father calls a taxi. 6:00,
go to the train station, about 3 1/2 train ride to Budapest. The taxi, this is
winter, in the snow, happens to be a one-horse taxi. It's a sleigh. Very
common. There were motorized taxis and horse-drawn taxis. | thought it
was a great adventure, I'm a kid, with this troika in front of me, thinking I'm
going to be --
>> Bill Benson: Manny, the Germans end up occupying Hungary in March
1944. Hungary was an ally of the Germans. What led to the German
occupation and then what did that mean for you once the Germans arrived?
>> Manny Mandel: The First World War, where Hungary was an ally of
Germany, produced a regent who was the ruler of Hungary. The regent was
a man named Horty. Horty was an admiral. You got to say to yourself, folks,
how in heaven's name can an admiral in a landlocked country? But it's

legitimate.

In the First World War, for those who know, the map of Europe, you
think about the Adriatic Sea, think about the top of the Adriatic, where Italy
and Yugoslavia connect, which had been disputed territory and to some
degree still is. Many sea battles of the type that took place in the First World
War took place there, and that's where Horty earned his spurs and was a
legitimate admiral. | don't know exactly how many shims he had, but he is an
admiral, the leader.

He makes a pact with Hitler to become an ally. That pact continues.
While that pact continues the Germans do not occupy Hungary.

Now, in 1942, a conference takes place in Berlin called the Wannsee
Conference. The Wannsee Conference has a number of people in it. They
come up with the term that becomes a terrible term for us to remember.
Namely, they come up with the answer of the final solution to the Jewish
problem. What is the final solution? Complete and utter destruction.

They appoint a man to conduct that process, his name is Adoph
Eichmann. Eichmann, who was then caught in Argentina, tried in Israel and
executed. Well after the war.

Eichmann's job is to clean Europe of Jews. The Nazi position clearly
outlined in Mein Kafmp, Hitler's book which he wrote in prison, said let's get
them out of Germany, then Europe, then the world. He didn't quite achieve

that. The point is Eichmann clears all of the countries of Europe. That's
where the people come from to go to Auschwitz, Birkenau, Treblinka and all

week period almost 600,000 Jews were deported.

apparent better situation in Hungary and later in Budapest, people came, and
it swelled by an additional 400,000, thus created the 600,000. Not all
600,000 were killed, but a large portion were. Most were from other places,
who migrated to Budapest, because they thought it was a safe place.
>> Bill Benson: You lost your grandparents in that time.

mother's parents, with the two aunts | mentioned, and the daughter of one of
the aunts. They got to Auschwitz Birkenau, the grandparents and daughNter,

The aunts, who were 30-something-year-old women, were told to go
the other way. They worked in labor, starved and they survived.
>> Bill Benson: While that's going on, there comes this proposal to swap
Jews for trucks. This audacious proposal. Tell us how this originated, what
the swap was supposed to be and, of course, it had huge implications for you
and your family.
>> Manny Mandel: Eichmann arrives March 19. Probably within days, if not
hours, he's approached by two members of something called the rescue
committee. Not totally, but to some degree self-appointed. They were not
really representing the Jewish community's establishment, because one of
them came from another city. The man's name is Kostner. Lawyer. Kluche

in Romanian. He and his family moved to Budapest earlier, not quite then.
He and another man, who had essentially trained and lived in Germany by
the name of Joel Brand, approached Eichmann, demand to see Eichmann.

Ladies and gentlemen, you don't demand to see Adoph Eichmann.
You beg and cajole, but that's not what they did. Thank God they did that,
because the kind of arrogance, the kind of gall it took for them to do that is
almost more difficult to imagine than it is, but they felt that the only way they
could get through, and Eichmann to some degree because of some curiosity,
"Who are these idiots?" Was willing to see them. In the beginning
discussions they come up with a plan. If Eichmann releases a million Jews
from his holding, they will procure for him 10,000 trucks laden with materiel
and material to be used in the Eastern Front.

Folks, if you know what a $3 bill is, | just described one. Again,
Eichmann did not have the people to release, even if he had the authority.
These folks didn't have a spare tire, let alone 10,000 trucks. However,
Kostner stays to negotiate with Eichmann. Brand is dispatched to speak to
the allies in Egypt, The British allies particularly, to secure 10,000 trucks.
| don't want to tell you how absurd that is, but pretty absurd.
Brand is arrested in Syria, spends the rest of the war in Egypt, in Cairo, in
jail. Survives the war.

useless.

Now, you want to remember that this is taking place April of 1944. If
you recall, D-Day is June of 1944. The war ends on May 5 of 1944. We'll
come back to that date later.
>> Bill Benson: 1945 it ends.
>> Manny Mandel: 1945, I'm sorry. This is within a year of the end of the
war. By this time the German high command all the way up to Himmler, not
Hitler, Himmler, are interested in thinking about issues having to do with war
crimes, postwar issues, because they realize that the possibility of the
Germans winning the war is disappearing with enormous rapidity.

D-Day, June 6, 1944, was the beginning of the -- clear beginning of
the end. They're willing to make arrangements, deals. But 10,000 trucks for
a million Jews never happened. Couldn't happen. But out of that came a
different arrangement, whereby for certain amounts of money, and not
money so much because money, paper money, was useless. Yes, if you had
pounds Sterling, the British currency, fine. If you had dollars, fine. Nobody
had them. This became valuable items. Jewelry, gold, silver, that which is
portable in suitcases.

To some degree, Eichmann and his cohorts found refuge in South
America after the war, and | can assure you they were not only on welfare

but unemployment compensation. They had these moneys. Mengela, the
famous doctor in Auschwitz and others, all benefited from this. The trade-off
was that 1/00-some people were placed on 35 cars to be taken to a neutral
port and possibly even to a German port, like Hamburg, to be dispatched out
of Europe, because out of Europe was a good thing in terms of getting Jews
out of at least Germany.
>> Bill Benson: 1700 would be saved by this?
>> Manny Mandel: 17 and change.
>> Bill Benson: That's what --
>> Manny Mandel: We were not taken to the port.
>> Bill Benson: Before you talking about taken, a million is a huge number,
1700 is a small number. Who comprised the 1700?
>> Manny Mandel: Nobody. Every single group, every single organization,
every single segment of the Jewish community in Budapest at the time made
petitions, and somehow they have three of these, four of those, six, seven of
those, somehow this comprised it, including, but perhaps starting with, some
25 people, thereabouts, of Kostner's only family. Not he. He stayed behind.
But his wife, children, cousins. Various members of the family came and
were to be given this priority arrangement. If I'm making a deal, | will
certainly insist that my family be part of that deal.

Not his whole family, about 25. | don't know the exact number.

Beyond the 25, the rest of the 1700-some were from this religious
organization, this sports organization, that school, various groupings, three
here, four there, comprising. | don't think anybody with all of their research
will ever be able to verify completely.

One of the best books on the subject is a book that Ladsi Loeb wrote

camp. He later became a Hungarian born, Swiss educated, German
professor in England. Ladsi Loeb, | corresponded with him in the last week,
lives in England, he wrote a well-researched book. His book is not totally
illuminative of all of the various groupings. It's kinda, kinda, kinda, that's how
the group was made up.

my Uncle David would have been part of it, because of his connections, my
father's connections, their station in the community. | don't know. One thing
I'm certain of, | had nothing to do with it. Not as an 8-year-old. We're taken
not to a port, but to Bergen-Belsen. Continue.
>> Bill Benson: That was the concentration camp where Anne Frank died.
>> Manny Mandel: Nota killing camp. I'll make comment on that to
conclude this segment. We are taken to Bergen-Belsen on the ruse that we
have three days of Rand R. After that, 60 people are taken out. I'm not one.

Which is a lot better place to be in than in Bergen-Belsen.
>> Bill Benson: What was it like during that time in Bergen-Belsen? You
were there for a substantial period of time.
>> Manny Mandel: The thing that occupied our time mostly was census,
back to the census. Every morning we're told at dawn there will be a
counting of the people. They didn't tell us when. We were told to be out at
dawn, which we did. For some time. | can't give you specific period of time,
rain, snow, whatever, out there. Until one of the officers said this is
ridiculous. He said, I'm going to be here, let's say, 8:00 precisely. The
precision was guaranteed. | don't care if you come out at 4:00 in the morning
or 7:30, but be here at 8:00. It saved a lot of grief. It took up, in the earlier
part, several hours of the day.

The other part was time spent attempting to make something of
the food that was provided. Nobody starved and nobody gained weight.
Because we went on this so-called trip to a port, we were told to pack some
food. Miraculously, these foods lasted much longer than it would have lasted
anyplace else. | assure you there was not a crumb that was not used.

So we're involved in that. Third thing that happened in camp, almost
within days that we arrived, remember, this is a concentration camp, it's a
labor camp, it is not a killing camp. Almost within days, certainly several

because businesses provide you with the opportunity to survive. There's
something normal about that. You couldn't change our logic, couldn't change
our this, that, and the other. But people were able to manufacture certain
little items that they could trade for two cigarettes, which would be traded for
a haircut, which was traded for having your shoes fixed, which was traded for
something else. That's a business of sorts. It permits you to have some
reason to exist in the morning. And as a consequence, the camp was
evolving. We had daily inspections, we had periodic showers in warm water.
No gas. Other than that, life was in a barrack, which was not heated, which
was difficult, but survivable. All of us lost weight. Nobody died.

The second thing | did very well, | was bored because there's nothing

second one, in those days and that place had no political implications but

experience? Read about Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hungarian.

other of those in that 1700 group, did they at some point begin to feel that
they would get out or was it this was just a big trick or trap and we're stuck
here in a concentration camp?

four-engine things that were going to bomb Hamburg, because Hamburg was
a major fort, and Hannover. We saw that all the time. | don't think we had
any real understanding of -- D-Day we knew about, because that happened
before we left. Other than that, I'm sure we didn't know anything about the
Battle of the Bulge, unless we got out. We didn't have any real
understanding. We didn't have a clear enough understanding of is this a
death camp or not. When people want to not die, they don't plan on dying. It

need to remember that the war ends on May 8, 1945, which is a very
important date in history. You already know, if you forgot, I'll remind you, it is
also my birthday, May 8. It is also the birthday of the President of the United
States. Not Roosevelt. Roosevelt died April, | think 17, 1945. Two, three

him? Did he know what had happened to you? Did he know where you

Hungary itself. We knew where he was when we left. He knew we were

happen to him.

Shortly after we left, this is towards the end of 1944, he was taken out
of territorial Hungary with his group and began to do similar work,
fortifications, whatnot, in the Ukraine.

As the Russians were approaching, he and a couple dozen of his
colleagues in this battalion decided to take the risk of just walking away.

that happened, we were able to use the -- not the offices as much as the
