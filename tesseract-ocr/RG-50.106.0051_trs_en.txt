| 9 majority of them were not as.lucky as we and they had papers |
- 10 || only as far as Shanghai, and that was back to all the --
| | 11 yeah, From Mukden, they then headed north to Shanghai. |
| , | 12 7 With, with the ship, however, it indicates }
( - 13 that there ware a hundred and sixty refugees aboard the
] 14 Haiyo-Maru (Phonetic) , nalf of whom —-- and I'm quoting the
7 15 article here --"half of whom were to debark here and in Los
8 16 Angeles, and the others at Mexican and Latin American ports."
17 / And at the end of the article, last part of the >
+ 18 article says, "The vessle was due to continue her voyage to

19 Valparaiso, Chile, tomorrow." | |

. 4 second. Just -- let’s put this on tape, and let me preface
5 it to say that this really is -- this, yeah, but I want to |
6 say something here because it's important to, to future ,
, 7 students of, of the Jewish society in America and how it was
. 8 shaped by the immigration of, of the European Jews, the, the ,
, | 9 pre-holocaust ~~ the refugees like us who came out literally |
10 “five minutes before’ midnight, before the gates were slammed |
11 shut. _ | | , | ; |
12 | and it has a lot to do with, with where we are |
| 13 today in the United States as Jews, politically and socially
- | 14 and economically, because in those early days, the, the very
| , 15 reason that not many Jews were saved who could have been
: | 16 saved by the, the, the lack of political clout, of political
, 8 17 strength of the Jewish community and the devisiveness of the
, : , 18 Jewish community at that time. It also had a lot to do with
, 19. the attitude of the Jews who. had come earlier, who were not
: | 20 willing to accept refugees into their midst, who were not
, ; 21 || prepared to assist in any way because it endangered their ,
a 22 social and their economic position, and this has been true
| 23 of every immigration to this country over the years. It's ,
| 24 evident now in the lack of welcome for the influx of the

( | 2 three of us, and somebody said, well, here you are, and the |

( 2 my voice. , |
| 3 | I think it's important that we record how
| 4 difficult it was. One of the, one of the requirements for
7 | , 5 getting a number, a visa to leave Germany, it was a
6 requirement of the. American, in addition to the affidavit,
7 which meant that someone here would vouch for you and that
7 | 8 you would not become a burden on the state or on the country,
: 9 was that you had a, a trade with which you could support | |
: 10 yourself when you arrived. : | | ,
| | | 11 . | My father mentioned earlier that he worked for
12 a firm in which his father had started as an apprentice in
( 13 his youth and had gone all the way to the, the chairman of
, : , 14 the board of president or whatever, a large firm. But it's |
3 15 one, a trade which my father learned as an apprentice, and,
oo 16 and worked all of his working days in Germany, but not a
S 17 particularly marketable commodity in the United States because
18 if you're familiar with what veneer is, it just isn't used ,
19 too much since, since the advent of vinyl and plastics and
