But when I bec \u2014 later on when I was able to afford to go to college, I talked to the prof who taught me the courses I had on [indecipherable] and I convinced him I didn\u2019t have to take the course, he would give me academic credit for it. So that helped me. And I had \u2014 in fact, one of the guys was, 1-in one of the fields, the number one man in the country, who happened to be the head of the department for engineering drawing at Ohio State.

And on Thanksgiving day was my first day of KP. And that was a big job that time. Then I spent time in the army, I was being \u2014 with engineering back on \u2014 they put me into a signal corps, which, I mean, technical things, and then I went to something called ASTP, are you familiar with that term?"

And they had it in two different \u2014 in several fields, one of them was linguistically, and the other one was engineering. So I went to the University of Illinois, where they tested me, and I qualified both for language and for engineering.

And wa \u2014 they had guys like me, assigned to battalion headquarter, and if they brought in something that was suspicious, I had to give it for a screening. I know one time they brought in a guy with a fancy uniform, brass buttons, and a red cap. And I looked at him and I looked his I.D. and I looked at his brass button, and it said RB, which means Reichsbahn. And said, take that guy back to the railway station, he is the station master.

And situation, they were in the Nuremberg trials and I was at a briefing by Supreme Court Justice Jackson, who was the prosecutor for Nuremberg. And I attended one of these meetings; they said, as you investigate, you gotta look for two things. Cri \u2014 preparing for and conducting aggressive warfare. That we found Krupp, because he was building tanks and stuff like that, and testing them, and things of that nature \u2014 other war material. The other one was crimes against humanity; slave labor and that kind of stuff. And this ma \u2014 old man, Krupp \u2014and I have a lot of his personal history, to \u2014 was in \u2014 retired, I think because of health reasons, about the same t \u2014 about the time Paris fell. So that\u2019s before slave labor because a problem. And his son took over. So \u2014 and he and his son didn\u2019t get along at all. And so he had \u2014 the \u2014 the old man didn\u2019t have anything to do with the operation of the factory, or their personnel, or policies. He was there collecting his retirement pay, and that\u2019s about all. In fact, it\u2019s an interesting situation, that this guy is, when he was born, was not \u2014 his name was not Krupp, because old man Krupp, who was very big before World War I, who built up the factory a lot, Alfred Krupp, and he ha \u2014 only had daughters, he had no sons. But he wanted to perpetuate the name and the family. So the Kaiser had an edict by which the boyfriend, who was Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, was going to marry the Krupp woman, one of the Krupp daughters, could combine the name, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach.

And then, after the \u2014 they rearranged the zones and \u2014 and that area of Weimar became Russian zone. So, since we had the evidence, like lampshades made from human bl \u2014 from human skin, and SS guards and oth \u2014 and all kind of stuff, including the wife of the former commandant, Ilse Koch, and \u2014 more about her later. I said I have a long history of \u2014 [indecipherable] history. And so \u2014 so we moved before our troops withdrew from that area, and the Russians moved in. We took all the stuff and put it into a facility in Dachau. We could intern the prisoners and had enough storage facilities to store the evidence. And there was a mission. Since \u2014 since Buchenwald was supposed to be tried by Russia, and since this is the Russian zone, we \u2014 we had a team of about two, three attorneys and about four linguists, who went through all that stuff that had been collected, and they \u2014 the lawyers put it into a legal documentation, to turn over to the Russians, that they could use it as evidence. But the wi \u2014 Russians refused to accept it. They did not want to annoy the Germans. It\u2019s in their zone, they wanted to say the communists are not doing things that Germany look bad. So they refused to do this. And so about \u2014 that was before Churchill spoke about the Iron Curtain. That was Russia did not live up to its commitment under the Yalta Conference. So it\u2019s \u2014 for many years later \u2014 about two years later they would \u2014 the Buchenwald people were tried in American war crimes trial, and I participated in that one.

The U.S. trials. And one of the most in \u2014 at times I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to do that. For a while I was either assistant to the prosecutor, assistant to the defense counselor, and was [indecipherable] court interpreter. Was sometimes assistant to the judge, because they had terms, which different people translated different ways. And they were \u2014 the judges were confused and they said, we heard this was said to them, to them, what \u2014 how it happened? And then I had to figure out these were the same \u2014 translating 1t back into German, these were the same organization. So, and \u2014 but there was \u2014 there was some interesting people there. Probably the most famous \u2014 one of the most famous person who was tried there, but he was acquitted, that was Otto Skorzeny. Did you ever heard about that name\u2019? Otto Skorzeny was the commander of the German Ranger. In fact, he became famous. After the Italian partisans had ca captured Mussolini and kept him on top of a mountain as a prisoner, his ranger unit, with gliders and with mountain troops, stormed that place and rescued Mussolini. The partisan got Mussolini couple months later on and they killed him, but \u2014 but that was the guy. And this guy also became famous during the Battle of the Bulge, because he was commanding this ranger, German ranger battalion, and he put them all in German \u2014 in American uniforms, to go behind our lines \u2014 through our lines and disturb things, maybe destroy signal equipment and put on markers, direction signs, turn them around and to ca \u2014 and they were trying to, during the Battle of the Bulge, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

The prosecutor was a famous lawyer from Atlanta, who had \u2014 he was usually a defense counselor, and he lost most of the cases, as defense counselor in war crimes trials. But he was a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because there was a guy who was \u2014 I don\u2019t even know whether he was a lawyer or not, or he had some lawyer assistance. And he found out that you cannot get anybody on espionage, or sabotage. These are ruses of war. As long as you are not \u2014 as long as you are caught \u2014 not caught in the other country\u2019s uniform. There were some of his men who were caught in American uniforms, and they were shot. But he was caught later on, I forgot whether in German uniform, or in civilian clothes. Therefore that stopped it and he was acquitted. And then he became other things, he was \u2014 became the chief of security for Egypt. He was sometimes \u2014 there was a \u2014 were some articles written, the most dangerous man in Europe, because he had that wartime experience, and he was helping Egypt.

Right before that, he gave his matched pair of dogs to a local farmer. And I found out about those dogs. And he bred them, and I got one of his offsprings. But then, the kind of situations that people do \u2014 in the thing, for instance, I was stationed in Dachau that time, and we had took a barrack where we get some veterinarians who were prisoners, and we dro \u2014 got a couple veterinarians and a couple farm boys, and we had a veterinary clinic, because some of us had to go out of town for a couple of weeks, so we left the dogs there. But they were too \u2014 even too dumb to make sure they had all the medicine, so they died of distemper.

And they were housed in German army barracks, and they lived better than the population because they had all the heat, the hot water, they had decent food, which was short at that time, but they were bored. So we arranged with them, a craft shop. Some of them were very handy. And I have \u2014 still have at home, four paintings which \u2014 watercolors, about this size, which the guy did from memory, and they are very nice paintings, and I really treasure them.

And I stayed there as a civilian, where I made quite a bit more money, but I was a -\u2014 they had a uniform for the civilians. So \u2014 and it was important that you wore some service ribbons, that meant you were not a carpetbagger. Some guys, they just went there and never in the service, but the fact that you were in the service, you were accepted by them. And we could go to the R and R centers in the \u2014 near the Alps and used to have some good times over the weekends. And was on a lake, and early morning there had to be a festival. And then you went on a sailboat. They rigged it for you, you didn\u2019t have to rig it yourself, and then we sailed until lunchtime. And then there was a \u2014 then there\u2019d be a party in the afternoon. So \u2014 and with an oompah-pah bands and all this kind of stuff. No, this 1s the \u2014 G.Ls at that particular time, if they could get to those places, the army took good care of them. Except one thing is, there was one of the experiences my wife had.

So it was \u2014 no, I\u2019ve been several times visiting Israel, but that was an interesting experience. Also, from the military point of view, there is a place just east of \u2014 east of Tel Aviv on a mountain called Kenkillya(ph). From there you could fire some of the bigger guns into Tel Aviv. And I think the Israelis made a big mistake of ma \u2014 considering part of the West Bank, they should have annexed that, as a security, to control the high ground. After they found out at the Golan Heights how important the high ground is. So I\u2019m sure they had enough people who were studying this thing.
