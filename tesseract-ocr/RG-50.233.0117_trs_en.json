When the Hungarian people came, these last transports of this brick factory, it was called the sigamnalaager, gypsy lager. The number of the lager was called 32C. Later, I learned that the gypsy people were living there with family. It was a family lager. They killed them before the Hungarian Jews were brought there because they needed the place. Very few gypsies who were in Auschwitz survived Auschwitz. Most of them were killed at that time. We came there and the second day or the third day, we were newcomers. We were very stupid. We didn\u2019t know the regulations. For instance, we got some bread. Then people were coming and telling if you give me a piece of bread, I give you this pot and you can eat from this pot. One of my friends bought a pot to have a pot from barrack. Later on came, not the Germans, Port, \u2018toot\u2019 and then came another one and took it away because it was not allowed to have the pot. The pots were distributed before getting the food and then it was collected again. You couldn\u2019t own a pot and the people who sold the pot for bread knew it but she was hungry. Morika, that was Morika. We were stupid and I don\u2019t know, somehow, they arranged a transport from Yangers and we were standing there and one person was missing. I think one person was running away from this transport and they needed somebody. We were standing there with mother and they just took me and pushed me in this transport and we were separated. If I were not so stupid, some days later, I would run away again but I didn\u2019t run away. That was the transport, I was separated from mother. Then they took us to the next lager, took we to be which had only the wire, which was separated with this electrical wire from the other one where mother remained. I was there. I sleep and I heard they wanted to send for work, these transports. But it turned out that somebody had scarlet. Scarlet fever from these transports. So they stopped all the transports and we had to remain there. So mother was here and I was there. I could speak to her. It was not so easy but I have spoken to her every day, but in the very early morning because there were these towers in Auschwitz and in every tower was a German, an SS. If he thought that at the wire, there are too many people, he shot. I have seen with my eyes two girls who were shot. One was speaking with her sister who was on the other side and one was speaking with her mother. I have seen two girls who were shot."

On the 27\" when the cannon, in the morning everything it was silence, stopped, the cannon stopped and everything stopped. At noon, the first Russian soldiers arrived to the camp. They were wearing this white gown, it was winter. At twelve o\u2019clock, I went to bring some coal to heat this, because it was a long, long oven along the whole barrack which could be heated. It was not warm but it was not ice cold in the barrack and we could heat it some of. We went to bring fuel and then we have seen the first two soldiers who were coming. That was the first camp where they found living people. People who were alive. They passed already, the Russian army, passed already Treblinka and Majdanek and nobody was there alive. It turned our that Auschwitz was undermanned too but I had no time anymore to do anything. They just run away, the Wehrmacht army never came to the camp who were fighting back. The SS run away and the Wehrmacht didn\u2019t come. In the afternoon came a high ranking officer, a Russian officer, early afternoon. He went in every barrack, it was only two parts of Birkenau. He told us that this is a surprise for them; that they can find here people who are living. They are not prepared for that. They can\u2019t give to eat anything else but tea and sweet. That they bring as much as we want and he will promise that in five days we will have everything to eat. That was our chance. Because these ill people who were starved, that they couldn\u2019t eat anything else but tea and sweet, that was the best solution for them. American and English soldiers made a big fault when, for instance in Bergen-Belsen, the English people gave food, rich food for these people. We know it because a cousin of his was there and many people died because of the rich food. Here in Auschwitz everybody had to eat because they had nothing. But in two days, we got food already, not in five, in two days they could give us food. Then they took everybody from Birkenau to the main lager where the barracks were bleak. It was an old soldier camp from the Polish army, the main camp in Auschwitz. Everybody was taken there from these wooden barracks/ Everybody was -- it was a military hospital for at least ill people. Sorry to say, there were many people who died later on because they were so ill, that they couldn\u2019t be cured.

That is a good feeling, he was not alone and this cousin could give some food for him. He was very happy, the cousin told me that he is not alone and he had somebody. So this was not so bad. The physicians who were there, they have no wonder that he will die, he is so ill that he will die."

I was told go to the garbage kommando; they will take you out and you can meet your father. I met my father. Unfortunately, with the previous transport, my brother was there too, but then I was not there. I could see my father and I hardly recognized my father because he looked like, before Auschwitz like on this photo, he looked so young, not white hair or nothing. Then he was white and very, very old. Therefore, I tell you that was a disappointment in the whole mankind which took him away and not any of this. I met him in the garbage."

            "question": "Is there anything else that you want to tell about your experiences before the liberation?",
            "answer": "The story with my illness. I told you that I was one of the four most ill persons. This Russian military hospital was dissolved in \u201945, September. In \u201945 September, I was certified (??) tuberculosis already and they took me to Krakow because I couldn\u2019t walk yet. They took me to Krakow, the university clinic. Ten more months, I had to stay there. I was there and I returned to Hungary \u00b046, the 1\u201c of August. It was very difficult for me to come back, I had no documents, only one small paper which I got from the Polish Red Cross that I was this number and with my name, that I was liberated in Auschwitz by the Russian army. It was written on this paper that everybody is asked to help me get home. In \u201946, everybody was at home already, or everybody died, and I had to walk to Ka____ to the Red Cross and they couldn\u2019t arrange me to go home, the permission to go home. I went to the council, to a high- ranking officer in Ka___ I know who he was. I was told if I give him sum, I can leave the camp. He will give me document and I can go wherever I want but I have no money. He told me if I go, that the paper that you have is nothing. If I go to the Russian people, I can get the same paper from them. It is nothing like you have. I was very angry. I decided that I will go to the State Department in Russian. I have to find somebody who will believe me, that I am Hungarian and a Jew and I have to go home. From Ka ___, the Red Cross gave me fare, the , to go to Russia. I went to the State Department and I went and I found somebody who was responsible for the east European countries. I told him that I am an Hungarian and he answered me Hungarian. It turned out that during the war he was in Hungary and he had a Hungarian wife. He spoke Hungarian and then he told me that he will arrange me. He began to call everybody and he told me that he will arrange for me permission to leave the country. I will get it from him but I have to come back in ten days because he tried to arrange it at once but it doesn\u2019t work. He needs time and I should return in ten days. I went back to Ka___ I was living there at the Red Cross. They had such a house there. In ten days, I went again to Russia and I got this paper. Then I had to go to this country official again that he should give me the stamp on this. Then he was very nice and he told me, I told you that you need a good document and that is a good document what you have now. Now you can leave the country. So he was very polite and very nice with me. I could come home, not so easily. It was funny because it was a group of Hungarian people. The most stupid story you have ever heard. It was a family with two This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection children and I don\u2019t know, with somebody else with two other people who had the same document what I had. A couple, it turned out that he was a Jew and she was a Christian and he was one of the men who hadn\u2019t got a Hungarian citizenship but he had a Polish citizenship. These people from Hungary were taken away in \u00b041 to somewhere, to Ukraine. They all were killed by the Germans there. Somehow, because the wife told that I don\u2019t leave him to go alone and I go with him, somehow, this very simple Christian woman, she could save his life. They came back from Ukraine with the same paper that they got somehow, the same paper what I had. I came home with this group. At the frontier, it was \u201946, the Russian officer didn\u2019t like us to enter the country. They say they will have to check who we are. We had to stay at the border; it was joined there already, this Jewish organization from here, from the state. They gave us food, they gave us where to sleep. We had to wait there. That was on the Hungarian border. I knew, somehow, these are Hungarian- speaking people who are living in this village. I spoke to somebody because in this village used to live the brother-in-law of this boy with his sister. They used to live in this village. What do you know about Mr. Mueller, this boyfriend who disappeared in Russia. I asked the people, do you know Mr. Mueller? They told yes, he\u2019s living, the wife is dead but he\u2019s still living. He is in the Hungarian part of the city which is called Est. I asked, how can I contact him, I asked this man. He told go to the riverside, that is the Danube, everybody knows him in Est__, asked the smugglers. The smuggler will take with pleasure your letter to Mueller because he is a rich man and he will give them money. If you write that you are here, he will manage somehow that you could cross the border. I did it and it happened that next day came somebody from the other side and looked for me in the joint. I told him that the check \u2014_ I\u2019m not allowed to know that he came to take me over. I should insist that I want to go and they will allow me without the permission but they will allow me to go. They will tell that they don\u2019t let me back if I can\u2019t cross the border but I should insist. The Hungarian said he will manage that I can enter the country. He came, I don\u2019t know. We told the wife that he came here. It happened like that, that I crossed the border and that the Hungarian say that I was accepted.. He waited for me already for me at the border. That is how I came home. In \u00b048 it turned out that I have -- I had relatives, and in \u201948 it turned out --. I always had some pain here and in \u201948, it turned out that itis TB. It was rather neglected as I walked with it two years long and I had to go to sanatorium and to lay for two years. Because I had it in the backbone and that was the __ treatment, now they have more medication. After coming home, I entered the university in \u201946. I had two years in the university. Then I gained a break because of this illness. That was four years and then I finished, in \u201955, I finished the university. I got excellence."
