My father had moved to Seattle in 1910 to join the Seattle YMCA as a Boys\u2019 Worker. So we spent the first 12 years at \u2014 in Seattle on Queen Anne Hill. Eventually moved up on the boulevard in Queen Anne Hill and built a house looking out over Lake Union. My bra \u2014 I have a older brother Robbins, and a younger sister Ruth, and we enjoyed a very pleasant gro \u2014 time at growing up in Seattle; it wasn\u2019t quite as crowded as it is now. The house we built is \u2014 in fact, I just heard from the lady who lives there, she bought it from my father in 1923, and has lived in it ever since. So the house remained the same. We had a normal childhood, my father was always off toa YMCA camp. And summers we\u2019d join him in the camp, so we spent a very pleasant time in Seattle. Then in 1923 my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I was five, my sister was seven or eight, and my brother was 10 or 11. And my father indicated that if we\u2019re going to work in a world\u2019s organization, he should see something of the Orient. So we sailed out of Seattle in November 1923 on the \u2014 one of the princess ships, and went, actually, practically all the way around the world in six months. As I think back on that, must \u2014 and have traveled with my own children, here were three young children and my mother taking care of us all the way around the world. We went first to Japan, and got there just after the big earthquake in Japan in 1923. Then M-Moncton(ph), Manchuria, China, Hong Kong. Then around through India, up through the Suez Canal, went over to Palestine, and eventually to Venice, an-and arrived in Geneva in April 1924. Which was quite a trip. So we settled into Geneva, which was then a much smaller town that it is now, but also a very international town, because a lot of international organizations were there, including the international Red Cross, and then many of the other youth-serving or people serving organizations."

Then I was 16, at which time I felt I was a little too young for college, and as he and my mother were traveling a great deal for the y \u2014 world\u2019s YMCA, I went to school in Germany, Deutsche Jugend \u2014 Jugendhof, which was 1932. And if you remember your history well, that was the time that Hitler came to power, in 1933. So I went through that whole time of the change in regime and cha \u2014 and heard Hitler speak twice, big rallies. And then at the end of the year, went back to Ohio \u2014 Oberlin College, Ohio, where I spent four years and got my bachelor\u2019s degree,37. At that time I wasn\u2019t quite sure what I wanted to do, a chance of working in the YMCA, or in the church. So I went to Yale Divinity School for three years in New Haven, Connecticut. In 19 grad \u2014 got my da\u2014 my master\u2019s degree in divinity and it was in 1940, first war had already started in Europe, and my father had headed up the war \u2014 war prisoner\u2019s aid of the YMCA, which was approved in the Geneva Convention, that international Red Cross took care of the physical problems of the prisoners on ev-every country, and the YMCA took care of their This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And then eventually the group went across southern France and up the Rhone Valley to Geneva. And went originally to work with the European Student Relief fund, which was an organization made up of the three student serving organizations. The World Student Christian Federation, the Protestants. The Pax Romana, the Catholics, NISS, a neutral organization. And our job was to do for stu \u2014 university students what the YMCA was doing for the general population. So we singled out students in camps in every country. I did go to Germany for about six months, to work in the prisoner of war camp, and visited Stalag 16, I think it was, and 17, one section of Germany.
