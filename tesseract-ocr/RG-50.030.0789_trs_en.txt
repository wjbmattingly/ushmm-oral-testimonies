A: Unfortunately.

little bit about the place where you were born.

A: My father Jusef(ph) Henry Zurezak was a teacher. He became an
administrator, a masters’ schoolteacher, and he was also a violinist.
Q: And your mother?
A: And my mother was a teacher majoring in mathematics and physics.
Q: Quite unusual for a woman.
A: Well, she had difficulties —
Q: Did she?
A: — with math when she started at, I think, the teachers’ sem — seminary in
Leszno. And she got help. [indecipherable] f — from another teacher, someone
who wanted to help her, saw that she was bright, but she was rather not too well.
And it helped that she became one of the best students when she graduated five
years later, so — and she loved math, so —
Q: That’s an inspiring —
A: Yes.
Q: — that’s an inspiring story, yeah. And when you — so if your parents were both
teachers, were they very active in the community of students, and — and school
activities, and — and things like that? Were they —

scout when he returned to Poland in 1920 or ’22. I don’t remember —
Q: Did your father fight in the first World War?
A: No. Both of my parents were born outside of Poland. My father was born in
Garnisonkirche, and then they moved to Dortmund, upper part of Germany,
and my mother was born in Helma(ph) Wiesbaden —
Q: So their —
A: — the northwest part of Germany.
Q: Did you have German family, or German roots?
A: No, because during the partition of Poland, that part of Poland was part of
Prussia. So they were taken — my grandparents were taken out of Poland to work,
and my grandmother, my mother’s parents were taken to Wiesbaden because my
grandfather was a forester and they needed someone to work there. And both he
and my grand — my grandmother worked together. She took the administration
under her hands, apparently that’s where my mother got these mathematical — 1-1t
— influence. And my father took care of the — the forestry, the cutting and the
taking care of and so forth.
Q: So they must have been bilingual.
A: Yes.

Q: They must have spoken German as well as Polish.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: And —
A: Except that my grandfather, my maternal grandfather came from a family that,

through the Carpathian mountains, came to Silesia, Shlunsk, and then — and —
but my mo — my grandmother was from Vierkapolska(ph), the up

dark, tall, my grandmother was blue eyed with very light blonde hair, and also tall.
So —
Q: And on your father’s side of the family, how did — how did they end up, it was
Garnisonkirchen(ph) —
A: Garnisonkirche, yes.

A: — from him. They brought the materials and two soldiers always watched the
staircase, and sat there. He worked sometimes 12 - 20 hours, in order to finish.
Q: And this was during the second World War?
A: During the second World War, but during the first World War, he was in
Garnisonkirche. He — I don’t know if he had interest, or he wanted to — not to
abandon the — the — the Polish immigrants that were taken to — ba — by the
Prussians to Germany. He received a permission to teach them religion. They
gave him only the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, written in old Polish.
And for one hour on Sunday, he taught them the language, based on the Bible.
Q: Isn’t that interesting.
A: Ah, but also he worked in the underground, because he was working with the
Polish workers, and they wanted to — they were fighting for their own rights, in
order to receive proper payment, and to be properly treated.
Q: And this is in Garnisonkirche?
A: And this is in Garnisonkirche, but somehow I think somebody —
Q: Informed on him?
A: — informed on him, and he was told that the best part would be if he left —
moved northwest, so he — they went to north Dortmund. And from there on he
promised himself that he will not return to Poland until Poland had a government.

The government was established in 1922, so I believe that it took them almost two
years to travel back.
Q: Amazing.
A: Yes.
Q: It’s not such a long distance.
A: No.
Q: So clearly these are stories you must have heard growing up, from either your
parents or your grandparents. Is that so?
A: Oh yes, Jaja(ph) would always t-tell me — my father’s father was also named
Jusef(ph), and he would — I loved stories. Apparently I was the only girl at that
time. I had 11 cousins, including my brothers and my cousin and I was the only
girl in that age. I had cousins, girls, but they were older, much older than I was,
about 10 - 12 years old. But —
Q: Well, that makes you quite special.
A: But I played with them, and when they were quarreling, they always said, okay,
we have to have a general. Who is going to be the general? They pointed at me
because I was the only girl. Would I quarrel with anybody”?
Q: Yeah. So, tell me a —a little bit about what happened to your family on
September 1*, 1939, when Germany attacked Poland. You were a baby, so —

A: My mother — my father was in the army, called in August that he should come

we were right — few kilometers south. But she told me that she moved from town
to town, zigzagging back and forth until she reached KoScian, because it was —

A: Yes, with my grandmother, mm-hm.
Q: And what happened with your father?
A: My father was caught in an ambush in — in the forest behind — around Oder,
and that part of the regiment was practically annihilated. He was shot, was
wounded. Those that were caught, which were about 10 — he said about 10, maybe
15 people, but no more, cause some of them were very wounded, but were alive.
They took them, but he passed out apparently, and after two days, the German
patrol was walking with dogs, and they stopped where he was lying, and the dogs
know if somebody is gone or alive. And when they searched him they saw my
father’s army registration ca-card, a teacher’s card, and that he was born in
Germany, so they took him for one of his — one of their own.
Q: So he wasn’t —
A: They took him to Germany, they took him to a German hospital, and he, after
a month, he came, he was well enough to speak, and he was interrogated. And my

That camp was a camp that was dedicated or — or protected by Himmel(ph). And

Q: So it was sort of like a show camp.
A: Yes. When there was no visitation, they would treat it like any other — well,
somebody — a prisoner. And, I mean, they had to scrape food. My father liked to
cook, and everybody knew this, so he sometimes actually — I said — he said, I

grandmother lived, and when I saw him, as an almost seven year old child, I
looked and I said, that is not my father. My father was a handsome man, with a
bushy hair. This 1s a sick man, this 1s — cause when I saw him in Lingen(ph) in
1945 in July, I saw a man bent over, grayish hair and — and his face was grayish, it

four years old. And I was always afraid to go to that room, because there was —

one wall was the glass, the opposite wall was composite of doors. And later on I

found out that books were on one side, and a wardrobe was on the other side. But

somebody took something out of it and left a black strip of a — I don’t know,

maybe of a — a sash, or something, but 1t was looking at me. And when that black

sash disappeared, I said she died.

Q: And were you right?

A: Yes. Because I told my mother this. And on that night, or day, she died. But I
