very early age, and I was not interested in the world around me. I was not much

[indecipherable]. But we did not — when they dis-dispersed the families into
settlements, it was a completely different situation.
Q: Well, from what I understand from the history, it was that there was a land reform
act.
A: Yeah, this is — oh, look at the Danish people, look at the German, you see they do
very well, you know?
Q: On single farm — single family farms.
A: Yeah, yeah, that was the motivation.
Q: And what you’re describing is much more the Russian mir system, where —
where villages were collected in one place. That is, they lived in one place.
A: They — they were not collected. They original, they grew from there, and the one,
and then the neighbor, ah, I like you, I will be here, also, I will, I will ma —
Q: Yeah — no, no, no, not — not —
A: It grew.
Q: — yeah, I— I used the wrong word. It was — it was natural, it was —

June 29, 2018
A: Yes.
Q: — but the land was somewhere else. The land was not —
A: Land — the land — each one had, you know, different spots there, and there, and
there.
Q: Tell me —
A: Later they joined, they said, okay, let’s have each one of us should ha — have all
our, you know, little — those places, in one place.
Q: That’s right. So that, if you had different plots of land in different areas, it’s all
united, and you have this one larger plot —
A: Yeah.
Q: — from the several. So, this was something significant for interwar years for
Lithuania, which 1s an agricultural country.
A: Economically, agriculturally, y-y-ye-yes it was a [indecipherable] but since man
does not live by bread alone —
Q: Yeah.
A: — it was an act. We, at least the culture, the songs, the — also that there be together
[indecipherable] many human values disappeared.

Q: How — how large —
A: Now, we are dreaming about getting back into communities. We’re met — we
destroyed them.
Q: That happens a lot. That happens a lot. How large a farm, then —
A: Twenty acres. We had the top with 20 acres.
Q: So, it would have been more in hectares, it would have been wa — about 30
hectares, or something?
A: I—I never understood the difference in size of — when we say in English, one
acre, and I don’t know. All I know that our farm was about one — at some point,
because I — to improve my health, which I said, that’s another big story, I — I p-
picked up running —
Q: Okay.
A: — one kilometer. So, we measured, with my brother Adolfas, from one end to the
other end from the farm was almost exactly a kilometer.

[indecipherable] says, you have to — you know, you have to take care of your — your
— it does not come —
Q: Naturally.
A: — not — especially when there’s so many temptations.
Q: Well, one of the reasons I ask the size of the farm is because that also was
significant in dividing people into classes in the interwar years, and especially when
there were various occupations. So five acres is a small farm. Fifty 1s already —
A: For — like our neighbor had 40. And — and how that was decided was, you know,
you — it’s the wetlands, some marshes, or the — the woods. And that — the neighbor
who had 40 acres, some of it was very sandy, and a lot of woods, and a lot of work
was needed to put into it, to make into — you know, usable land.

there was a market day in Birzai, and every Monday, early, from early, you — if you
read my poetry, you will find out. Every Monday there were carriages full — the

Q: That’s true.
A: — to — to it — to it. So, of course, that — to — I think she — I would say she were —
was — because of her mystical sort of — I mean, she comes from an — if her brother
decided to become a priest, so there is a — really something deeper in the family lore,
into that sort of, direction.
Q: Did you meet him?
A: Not only that I met him, and even when she was studying still in Switzerland,
during their vacation, he used to come with this straw hats, and he always gave me,
before leaving, his straw hat. So that —
Q: So you have the honored hat.
A: —I—I-—TI inherited these hat — not cap, hat with — from him. And then, in Birzai,
when I went to high school, I stayed — the first year I stayed in some little, old
Jewish place. A Jewish man who was running bagel shop, and had an extra room.

Q: So, your fa — your brother was a — a CP member.
A: He was — you see, it’s here we — where I do not know the details, because many

to make my — my — my observations, yes.
Q: I understand that. I understand that. It is — excuse us — okay. There are — I’m
going to talk now, more than I usually do, but it will be in two parts. One, in trying
to say back to you what I think I understood. Second, about the purpose of
interviews like this, and the whole idea of oral histories. When — when we — when
we conduct them, the strengths of oral histories are exactly what you say, you know
you’re right. It is in the impressions, it is in the experiences, it is in the memories.
A: The danger is always to have — make it too narrow, too restricted. Permit a lit —
me to open that’s there, and —
Q: Yeah.
A: — which sometimes, on direct memories observations, are more truthful than —
than factual sometimes, factual.
Q: Well, that — people say that about art.
A: Yes.
Q: That — but in the — in the purpose of what we’re doing here, is we’re trying to
establish an historical record, through the memories of people, decades after the
events happened. And — and that’s why, in some ways, it is a counter kind of
purpose. And, I would say, you know —

A: But that’s what you are getting.
Q: I know. But here’s the thing. What you are telling me, makes sense to me. But
that is because I know of a lot of the history that people who will be looking at this

understood it properly, so that someone else can understand it properly.
A: Yeah, do it.

some point in 1936, or 1937, because that’s the time of the Spanish Civil War, and it
is a topic that is discussed, you remember being in your bed area, you know, the —
separate from the living room, and lying and hearing — lying down in your bed, and
hearing others in your family, behind the curtains, talking about politics.

Q: Okay.
A: Yeah.
Q: So you — for example, at that time, you’re about 14 years old. Your brother is
already a young man, he’s around 23 - 24 years old. And he invites his friends over,
and they’re talking about the Spanish Civil War, and they’re talking about social
democracy of a certain kind, and in the end, they sing “The Internationale,” in
Lithuanian. And then you remember, but you didn’t know this at the time, but you
remember at some point in later years, hearing that when Justas Paleckis, who is
someone most American or English speaking people would not know about, but
Justas Paleckis was a leftist writer, who, when the Soviets came into the country,
became the president, quote, unquote. I don’t remember his exact title, but Snie¢kus
was the first party secretary, Paleckis was the president, and under his signature, a
lot of people get sent to Siberia, both then, and later. And what you are saying is that
you intuit that your brother was somehow or other, a trusted person, because
Paleckis —
A: Now I remember why.
Q: Okay.
A: They — the name of the monthly was called Joniemas(ph).

connected with the editorial staff, or something. But that’s th — how they — they sort
of —
Q: What their connection was.
A: — the connection was, that she wrote — she published some poems, a-and his
daughter sent to me some of those poems, they were sort of po — okay, I mean, they
would call it at little — the leftist kind of — no, wa — politically — they’re obviously
political poems.
Q: Okay, and about when would — would have this been before the war? Befor —
A: Thi-This — this was before.
Q: Okay, so during independence times.
A: Yes, yes.
Q: Okay. And so, your brother is trusted enough by Paleckis wa —
A: To ask for his opinion.
Q: — to — for his opinion to be asked, should Paleckis take that post, which was quite
A: I don’t know what that discussion was, but I understood that I do not remember
my brother’s voice. But I think was to the — in some way, he was consulting him,
should I take it, or not, trying to make up his mind. And I have no idea what my

Q: What does later mean?
A: Already in — in ’71, when I —
Q: Okay, when you went back.
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: Okay. So this is 30 years — 33 years later, something li — well, sa — 30 years later.
A: My — my brother is a — fell out of that — went to the — very soon, after the Soviets
came in, my — Povilas come — went — come — abandoned that direction, completely.

A: Yeah.
Q: Okay. But he had it. In other words, if there was a direction of political thinking
in your family, through po — and Povilas sounds like the most political —
A: The other two brothers, they were not political at all.

branches of the trees by the road, by the cemeteries, and the cemeteries were by our
house, there were some leaflets attached again, political leaflets. I have no idea what
they promoted. And it was next day after that, that I had to stop at their house in
Kubeliai — Kubeliai for something, and the police was — and I saw that, you know,
everything was — was in a mess. The police was there. They probably suspected that
they produced those leaflets and hung them there.

A: Same as later, when the Germans, same as Soviets, they did not come blindly,
with no preparations. They had already people watching for years, probably, and
some of them were connected, preparing, you know, here and there and there. Like
Germans had same. Some of them — some of those people maybe were, you know — I

reaction in SemeniSkiai, or Birzai, or Papilys, about the German attack on Poland,
September first?
A: There were two reactions. The dominant reaction was ah, we have Vilnius now
back.
Q: Because of the controversy with Poland on Vilnius.
A: Yes, yes. Vilnius was the center — there was produced happiness. The — the Poles
were the most hated nation in the world, for Lithuanians.

they’re bad, bad [indecipherable]. They are the [indecipherable]
Q: So you said there was another. There was — there were two reactions. One was
nice —
A: Oh, the other reaction that says oh, now — now — now, we may have another war.
We are having another war, and — and — and —
Q: So people started talking about that?

con — yes, every family already knew that this is bad.

A: That this is bad.
Q: Okay. Now, was the — when you mention that — that Russia attached Vilnius
back to Lithuania, why would Russia do —
A: I don’t know really, again my mem — see, I am very bad at dates — at which point
that became real, because first the — okay, Germany, and the — they met — they made
a deal with Russians, and they wanted, sort of, Poland.

A: Oh, so immediately, so that decision was —
Q: What — what the — what the — the factual reference —
A: All I remember boy — being in Papilys in sixth grade, in the bench, sitting there
in the middle of the class, and the teacher — somebody comes in and take the teacher
out, and then the teacher returns, and asks everybody to listen carefully, and tells that
the war started, and that — and the Soviets — that the message was given to the
teacher, and that was the situation. So — and so that — that’s how we found out what
happened.
Q: Okay. The background to this, from what I — from what I have read, is that that
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in August, 1939 — August 23", and one week
later, September first, is when Hitler attacks Poland. And sometime in the fall, I
believe it was October, I could be wrong, the Soviets start marching in, and that 1—
then — start marching in, but do not take over the country until 1940.
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, something like, yeah.

Lithuania’? What are your first memories of that?
A: Fear was — you began to feel — I mean, feel fear. You could feel it floating over,
like everybody — like how it manifested, that fear, I cannot describe now. But you
could feel it, and see it in the — in the — almost in the physical movements, in the
faces, and how — in the relationship. And silences here, and — creep in, and — and
then you — we immediately began hearing about neighbors being arrested there. It wa
— it started before the mass deportations, even those small deportations and arrests —
Q: Of people you knew?
A: Yeah — hm?
Q: Of people you knew”?
A: [indecipherable] not in our village, but in the neighboring villages, you cou —

A: But small arrests and deportations began immediately.
Q: Did your schoolteachers change?
A: Yes, the atmosphere felt like — like — like the de — joyful hap — sort of blissful,
careless atmosphere [indecipherable] like some cloud began descending.
Q: Did that mean that the teacher who might have formerly been a friendly teacher,
now became more closed, or did it mean it was a new teacher?
A: No, they were the same, but you could almost feel, you know, a certain kind of
seriousness, a different kind of — it changed da — through the village, it’s — I mean, 1-
i-it’s difficult to describe how a system, repressive system like that, and especially
when you begin to see the actual, real results can begin to affect the whole — th-the —

brother, who kept telling my mother and my father that he shoul — you should really
sum — he has to go, this [indecipherable] kid has to go to — so, because he sort of, I
guess, believed in me.
Q: Did they have to pay? Did it cost to send you to high school?

A: But then later — now I — I keep the information that I have seen was that there
were 2,000 Jews still in Birzai? Says, how could that be? Because that means that
5,000 people lived in Birzai, and there were 2,000 plus killed, that means almost like
a half. So th-there is something wrong, but I think that that figure comes that when
the Jews were killed in Birzai, they brought them from all other places, like
including Papilys.
Q: Okay.
A: Probably that’s what — that’s how the 2,000 come. Th — it does not come from the

She was a woman of some 40 — 40 — some 40 years, and she was always there, and

—I was still very fragile, and very naive, and very — sort of like, she may have really
meant okay, he made — he’s a stupid, little guy, and he made a mistake. If I tell him
maybe — you know, she like, had a picture of me. But then I thought, maybe she
played double game. Maybe she worked also for the underground. She may have
worked — okay, here I am, I’m hated, you know —
Q: Right.
A: — by everybody. I will — knew that, but I will — will be — I will also help the

answer, because later in that she retreated together with the — when the Soviets
retreated, and she was shot with other Jews. But she saved my life.

Q: Did you speak of this to anyone at the time?
A: I could not. I could not. Because I could not let the other students — they were

Q: So, what was going on with your brother Povilas at this time? The Soviets have
come in —
A: He — but like two or three months later — he told me this later.
Q: Yeah.
A: When he was already — he was already out.
Q: Okay, what was — was he still studying?
A: But he was struggle still, you know, leftist, and he sort of — he had some ideas.
Which is nothing wrong. But — but he was out of the — of the — if he had even any
dreams that maybe this was clear with — immediately, it was clear to anybody.
Q: At this point, Povilas would have been about, oh, 28 years old, something like
that.
A: He — he was working as a veterinarian already.
Q: Okay. In BirZai?
A: No, no, he was in Kedainiai — Kedainiai, and later in the Vilnius area.
Q: Area. Okay.
A: He was — became also very closed just in his profession. He did not write any
more, did not publish.

call innere immigration, you know?
A: Yeah, you know, that’s — that’s what — they said that. Unfortunately, the whole —
this [indecipherable] communists started in their ow — in their own country, and
their own time.
Q: I want to touch on something else that you mentioned earlier. And you said — and
that’s on the — the anti-Semitic aspect. You say that both the politruka —
A: Yeah.
Q: — and the mayor, were hated —
A: I think that — that fact that both were Jews, to the farming community, who had
just 20 years earlier, managed to liberate from tsars, and had this very — like a sense
of being independent, unfor — a-a-and still very, very fragile. To — to — to see that we
are again of controlled by somebody else, if not tsars, then Jews, somebody. I think
that these un — it was not — I could feel that. It was not talked much about, but jo — j-
jokes were made about [indecipherable]. I don’t remember those jokes, but — but
then the Russians — now we had again Russians, and the Jews, and the — a-a-and the
— and I think that that aspect — this has not been — maybe it has been written about,
sort of mentioned that this instituted just fresh liberation. And now again, somebody
else is there, on the — on top of us. Had important effect, on the why some were —
some — some of them ignored, or — or did not pay too much — and then, he — he — I —

especial — the killing of Jews, coincided with the big deportation, you know, of
Lithuania. But that minimized, I think, simp — sympathies for what was happening,
at the same time, to the Jews.
Q: Okay.
A: It affect how much, you know, the — like — like same went out and discuss, you
know, how Putin and Russia affected Trump’s el-election — election, and one says
this and this, the other [indecipherable]. But definitely, yes.
Q: And had you heard before, like in — before these events, before the Soviet
takeover, had you heard people make jokes about Jews, or say anti-Semitic things?
A: No, no, no, Jews were some — and what — even if I could read in those transcripts
from BBC, and later in the — you know, was typing them, it’s still — it was so
outrageous, that many did not believe that this really happened.
Q: Okay, what —
A: Saying that you don’t re — hu-human beings are not made up to react personally
to — to abominable events. Like, okay, I — I have to confess that I did not react to the
9-11 event, until I saw — met some, really peop — people who just managed to
escape. Or the — or the — the firemen from SoHo, right there where I live, then — then
it became real. When I watched the buildings collapse, and I knew that thousands of
people are there collapsing, I-I had no emotional res — it’s like, it was too big. It was

Abstract. Too big. Only when — it has to become more personal.
Q: Well, you know —

Q: Oh, you know, that reminds me of what Stalin said, which many people say was
his strategy and his tactic, that the death of six million, or — he didn’t use the word
six million, but the death of a million is a statistic, the death of one person is a
tragedy.
A: Yes.
Q: You know, I’m paraphrasing here, but it’s —

August. But, what in — is interesting for us is, did you see anything of this? Did

one Jewish family. So, of course, those who are used to buying certain things, the

A: We only knew that German now came in, and there they are.
Q: Okay.
A: We did not know, in the villages. In our village, in SemeniSkiai, we did not
know. Maybe somebody knew. I didn’t.
Q: Did anybody talk about that there was Lithuanian help in getting rid of the Jews,
or did they usually phrase —
A: I—I’m reading, and I’m told, and I— I — you know, I’m one who, when
somebody tells me, I believe. Later I descr — that has caused me many problems
sometimes.
Q: Yeah.
A: But I believe. If they say that there was some help in — the — wh-where I doubt is
that some of the aspects of that help are taken from the Soviets — Soviet sources.
There I become immediately very, very skeptical. The participation there, it’s clear
there was, but when they say, even if it’s a mild participation, comparatively, so we
will — we will shoot them. But you grow and protect the property that is left, which
is, you know, on direct sort of difference, likely. I— which has been picked up from
the Soviet sources. The Soviets were masters in impli — in making one guilty,
inventing reason, you know, so that when [indecipherable] one of friends of
Atronas(ph) was — is ac — or maybe his friends, I am told that they were asked to
take care, protect the properties.

Q: While the Jews are being shot.
A: Yes, Jewish — Jewish properties. [indecipherable]
Q: Yes, yes.
A: So, 1s it true, or is — an-and when they say, this they found out from confession
during the Soviet investigation, I — I don’t know it’s real or not real. They did not
like [indecipherable] because he was part of ‘the six’ in the underground, working
against the Soviets. So — so there the — what otherwise — here — when especially,
when I was already in this — in — displaced, after the war, in Germany, in displaced
person camps — and again, you have to read my book, “I Had Nowhere to Go,”
some of the young people, between 20 and 27, they were so horrible, they were —
they could kill anybody an — I mean, they could steal, rob, kill. And they came from
the — some were volunteers in the German army, some were drafted by force, but
while in the army, they became like that, but some volunteers. So, I have no doubt
that they could have shot Jews, or anybody, with — with no blink of the eye. They
were so — and — and I was living among some of them —
Q: Yeah.
A: —1n— immediately after the war, because they were, you know, just from the
army.

Q: Yes.
A: — that you know, I — I was not — I was still in my shell.
Q: Well, you were in a literary world, not — that’s — it sounds to me that that’s what
you are trying to tell me, is that 1t was literature and — and culture —
A: That’s all — was only one part. My retreat into the shell was caused by my illness.
Q: Okay.
A: And the illness went me into the mystics. And that’s where — in the period when I
was totally in Bhagavad Gita, in Krishnamurti, in Vydinas. I was there. The only
book I brought out with me was Bhagavad Gita. We do — we do an as — translation.
Q: No kidding?

very long and involved, and I could not understand what he was talking about there.
But it was — I was read — you know — I — before I sent — took to the printer, I always
read them, because there were many mistakes I had to, you know, correct. Language

Q: You know, almost in the same wa — following the footsteps.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah. Did you work at any time —
A: Everything went — and that’s why I say I lost with the quo — during that period of
occupations, I lost like, regular education. I really had no — well, you know, usually
you have gymnasium, then university, step by step, and then gradually you become
this or that. I did not have that. So I lost the normal growing, like, period. I jumped
from child to — to — to 27, when I was — landed in New York, I was 27. So there is
almost six, seven, eight, 10 years, totally messed up.
Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: No, even the universit — they were ne — after the war, you know, we’re still in
displaced person camp, and the camps are moving, moved around. First Wiesbaden,
okay Wiesbaden. The next, Wiesbaden, Mainz. There is a good university, so we
enlisted with Adolfas into university. But then a year later, they — they moved us to
Kassel. So I had to, for like a —a year, I commuted, once or twice a week from
Kassel to Wiesbaden.
Q: From Kassel to Wiesbaden.
A: Yes. And so I go for two or three days, I settle down in ka — in — in Mainz, and

Q: Let’s go back still to Lithuania. Did you ever work at another newspaper,
besides BirZu Zinios, or Naujosios BirZu Zinios, in PanevéZys?
A: That — the last months before I left, maybe for 10 months, or — I worked at
Panevézio — Panevézio balsas.
Q: Okay.
A: Which was — one step sort of more — okay, it was edit — BirZy Zinios were edited
by like — they were an education, Rudise(ph), and Lupniiinas, they were, you know,
teachers. What their other interests were, I never, you know, def — you know,
patriots, educate — educators. Panevézio balsas was edited by Jonas Narbutas(ph),
who was a writer, and had — was very closely connected with the Lithuanian writer —
artists, writers community. So, it was a more — they gave more space to — to — to — to
—he gave it to his friends, and they were writers, so there was — it was more like,
literary. Still the same — the same system, the same like how the fir — first page, to
the w-war — to Germany, and war machinery, bulletins. And then the rest the same,
[indecipherable] structure, local culture, and —

Panevézys to visit their friends. Very often the — I could sort of sit in the corner,
also, and listen.
Q: So what was your involvement with Panevézio balsas?
A: My function was similar to — to — to all — almost identical with BirZu Zinios, to —
to — to — to put all the pieces, Narbutas(ph) and his — and other sort of assistant
editors that he had, prepared for th — got all the materials that they passed to me, to —
to — to — to take it — to put it into the — to realizing, that means, give it to the line —
we — there, we had the lineta — linotypists already.
Q: Okay.
A: To type, and then to proofread, to — to — to some of — I did not have to read
already all of them, like Birzy Zinios, when Lupniiinas used to pass to me the
materials. Sometimes I — mo — I tried to read them all, and tried to correct pre —
paneva — Panevézio balsas had already a proofreader, and they had, you know,
corrector, so I — my function was to see that everything is there, every area, and
everyone who’s responsible for local news, for the art, or what’s happening in the —
in the arts in Panevézys, that they delivered it on time —
Q: So —
A: — and then to put it — the — the — the term was, I guess I invented it, technical —

Q: — you were doing layout work.
A: Yes, layout, and —
Q: And then some — and proofing. Proofing was in — more in BirZai than in
Panevézys, because you had a proofreader in Panevézys?
A: Yes, yes.
Q: But then in Panevézys, it was more than just layout, it was also responsibility —
A: In— oh, in Panevézys, all the materials are there already, ready on the — my table,
to take to the linotypist. The linotypist passes, brings to me, and then I pass it to the
proofreader, and then he brings me back, and I take back to the linotypist, he
corrects. And then, like a next day or so, 40 hours — it’s a weekly — 40 hours later, all
the metals are there, ready to put it into pages and places.
Q: Okay.
A: And I — and — and I did all that.

Q: To assign articles to other people.
A: Assign, yes.
Q: Does that —

believe same for all — all other regional newspapers after the — a year after th-the —
the killing of the Jews, you could really try to find with the various — you need a
strong light to find anti-Semitic article in any of those papers.
Q: In the regional press, you’re saying?
A: Yes. The capital, I don’t know. Regional I’m talking only, and I’m — I’m quite
familiar because I used to get in my little office in Panevézys, some of those
regional papers.
Q: But then —
A: They were all concerned for the local cultures, and they were fed up with — they
knew where they are, they knew where the Germans are, and — and — and what the
Germans — Germans all about. And I — I wouldn’t say a hundred percent, you know,
I’m not — I did not see everything. But not in BirZy Zinios, and not in pane —
Panevézio balsas. But during the first weeks, I know, because I have seen the

A: I would still — I would add something t — about the local newspapers.

Q: Be happy with it.
A: Yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: And they took chances. And it’s to their credit that — that they managed to devote
ma — most of their — the body of their newspapers to that life of not only what was
happening at that period, but there is a lot of the past, always, of — from pieces on
their past cultural personalities of the period, I mean going like — going back to

Q: Well, you know, two things come to mind; 1s that if we’re talking about articles
dealing with the past, I think East Europe, if I — I’m going to — I’m going to kind of

Q: Here is another thought, though, and it also has a certain parallel into how people

A: Here it’s very — totally different, because there you — you could not ri — choose
your own subject, could not choose your s — your own theme, and whatever you
wrote was the re — everything was read, and had to be approved. In Germany, at that
period, we don’t know what would have happened later, with, you know, a familiar,

A: Yes, I’m talking only about the so — but th — we know also, that it continued. That
the control, total control continued near — continued until after Khrushchev, maybe,
I don’t know.
Q: Yeah, that’s — that’s what I’m saying, is that in later decades, there was also
wiggle room, where people in the arts, and the culture would te — 1n the Soviet
Union in general, and this included Lithuania, would — would write their
perfunctory introductory paragraph, or —
A: Yeah, yeah.

been in film, or in books, that have talked about, what does it mean to one’s sense of
artistic integrity, and also human moral integrity, when you decide to play with the
bad guys, whoever they are.
A: Yeah, but there are — there were an — I know, during that period there were at
least five poets, and five prose writers, who already had the — I think they — they got
involved by mistake, because they — their first interest in the Soviet Union began
before the Soviets came. So they did not even knew — know what’s happening there.
They were sort of misled. But they were caught, and they — they — they still believed.

that can appear. I mean, what your — what I see in your descriptions of how the
regional press worked, how the — is that it’s an attempt to bring some non-
propaganda material into the public sphere. Yet now, when I read, let’s say, or
glance at papers from the time, they look particularly dangerous, because the non-
propaganda sections could legitimize the propaganda sections. Do you see what I’m
trying to say?
A: No, but we did not see it that way.
Q: No, you didn’t —
A: We did not see it, we did not accept it there, we did not treat it that way. But we
thought this [indecipherable] you know, this is that, that’s — you know. Who cares
about that? But this is our — this is our culture, this is our paper, and we don’t care
about that. It can be disputed, and there can be opinions, but in reality, when you are
there, and when you really live in that situation, you try to out — outsmart, you — of
course, you could not publish anything. You close the theaters, you cl — you do —
you just give the milk, give the [indecipherable] whatever Germans ask. But that’s
not how life goes under a — the occupation. People continue try to live, not to be
disturbed by it, and try to continue their lives normally, and ignore, and sort of like
to fight indirectly, 1n — in very invisible ways, the occupation. The fight is going

there, they began cutting. First they cut one hour, then another hour, and of course,
the more hours they cut, as they were cutting down, our — our spirits got — went the
same speed up. We knew that oh, they’re running out of stuff.
Q: Yeah.
A: But, well, that was not much better than the work, because you still had to be
there, and many hours, and — and since there was no more materials to really do the
work on those pieces, they — we had like to keep cleaning. Keep cleaning and
cleaning, and like 1-1t was, we came so bor — to work, you will work, you do,

same, had later somehow, they joined — they transferred from some other train, into
our train, two Karaims, Tinfavichas(ph). And then, when we arrived, already they
brought us to Elmshorn, we found that there was one — one more Lithuanian, and he
was — and I knew him from Birzai. He was a young graduate of medical school in
Riga, Kregzde, Jonas KregZde, who was very, very, very, very bright, he spoke
many — Riga had at that time — was a university where you could study Sanskrit, you
could — oriental languages and philosophies and — and he spoke them all, and he was
in music. We learned really a lot from him. So for some time they put him into our
barracks, also. And it’s from him — and he was very close to Jakubénas —
Jakubénas, prof — Professor Jakubénas was a — a — a te — te-teaching in Kaunas,
and there was some religious institute, a Protestant religion institute, and he was
quite, you know, prominent in his field in Lithuania. And he had the top — when

the first weeks, I think, or months of German occupation, and — and settled down in

A: Schleswig-Holstein. And Kregzde knew him, and the — a-a-and he was ver —
Jakubénas was respected by local Germans there, and they — he persuaded them to

here in — in Schleswig-Holstein, in — in — in that area. But before he left, he said, if
one day you want to try to — to — to — if you think it’s realistic to run to Sweden to
escape, I will give you some leads. He — he knew beca — from Riga, during his
studies, he had made contacts with — with Sweden. So, but he said — but first if —

Q: Kiel?
A: Denmark.
Q: In Denmark. Oh, okay.
A: No. So, we — we talked. Somehow when the — the hours became shorter, we
thought, why don’t we tell brothers Neunert that since there is no work here, you

Kiel.

A: But we also, when we said this, we knew that Kiel was bombed almost every day,
every night. So somehow, I — he did not know what to do with the workers.
Q: Because they’re all cleaning, they have nothing else to do.
A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: So, I think the idea came first — we overheard from him, that he was with his
brother, he had a brother who was a very, actually nice supervisor there. He used to
be a teacher, and when the war started, they put him in the factory. So, he never
liked, he was o — and he, that helped me — you see, I had the machine, I was working
with the machine. I all — always had little pieces of paper with German let — with
German words. I was studying there, my language. So he used to come to me like a
teacher, and then examine me. So, I think we overheard there was, then figured out —
out what do do with the workers, and that’s when we dropped this Kiel idea. So said,
oh, yes, I think we — we will be sending some people, some of the workers, because
there they still have materials.
Q: How did you know that Kiel was being bombed?
A: It was not very far from us.
Q: Okay.
A: All the workers knew, everybody was, don’t go there, don’t go there.

asks for our papers. So we had the basic papers fro — that Germans had given to all
their workers. So that it — identification was there, but the fact that wet — we’re
supposed to report to Kiel, that was not there. They — that did not know. So, is it —
no, you cannot — you cannot cross the border. So, they threw us out. So we — we
walk around, and we took our time, we walk around, and we — we go into like two or
three wagons, la — and we — and we — we walked there around, and we — we — we
sort of jumped into — on a train that was already like moving out. But it — like in 15
minutes we realized that it was not going to Denmark, it was going back to — to
Schleswig, or — or another town, back to where you — we came from.
Q: Someplace in — in Schleswig-Holstein.
A: Yes. But then we — we also noticed that this — every station, every train was full
of German refugees, that there was — it was already — there were so many Germans
running from the eastern parts, that already like was beginning of the chaos there. So
we said, why don’t we mix up with them?
Q: And did you?
A: And that’s what we did.
Q: Okay.
A: This is all like taking chances, but it was easy to take those chances, because we
noticed that even the police could not control any more.

bikes, and we again — because they said, you cannot go, there are no — there are no

Hamburg, which is like 30 miles or so, through the center —

we stayed in Hamburg for maybe a month or so, and then — then we had enough of

books, etcetera, in Kassel — that we are in Kassel, and we are from Birzai, he knew

know, have images that — of a group, and sometimes they get reduced to stereotypes,
and sometimes those stereotypes happen to have truth to them, you know’?
A: Yes, yes, yes.
Q: And one image that stays in my mind is what a — what you had said earlier,
during the first part of our interview, when we talked, and I asked, did you know of
anybody who had participated in crimes against the Jews, who ha — could have been
A: No, I can tell you right now.
Q: You didn’t.
A: No.
Q: You didn’t.
A: No. But from Michael — Michael — Michael — his last name always falls — has
written to me, has said that some of the people that I knew had practiced
[indecipherable]. Like the po — and in which way? Not in crimes, in the — that the
poet Matuzevicius(ph), who had — was in the — from gymnasium Birzai, two or
three years earlier than me, and some of his friends — and so I understood from

Michael that he has — that he has confessed to the Soviet secret police that during the
shooting of the Jews, he was asked with his friends to take care to protect their home
— their home belongings [indecipherable]
Q: Okay, their — their items, their assets, yeah.
A: Their assets. So that is the — so I— I knew, and — and actually admired li — like the
— like the younger, budding, you know, poets cal — you know, want to be published,
and want to be know — every young poet wants the — and has it — some people, close,
that he — older poets that he or she admires. At that time Matuzevicius(ph) was the
poet of [indecipherable]. He was the young, like [indecipherable]. And he was
good, and very promising. It did not happen, because he was arrested, he went to
Siberia, etcetera. He was destroyed. But we, all the younger of ones who — who
were writing poetry, wanted to be poet, admired. So, it was — when I heard this from
Michael, to me was a little bit of a shock. But he was also one of ‘the six.’ He said —
so, in those six — and he wrote a poem about six with — which was pub-published in
BirZy Zinios, at — I don’t know what — what — what month. And ‘the six’ became
like heroes. People did not know that such — that they existed, when — and they
found out tha-that somebody was in the underground. Whatever they did, some of
them later, I— I— I don’t know, but I think they were instrumental to — to star — help
others to decide that they should, you know, work underground also, like — like those
six who worked against the Soviets.

Q: Okay.
A: Now, I thought it was — when I read it, I thought I — I als-also like admired that
they did it, but I also thought, why is he publishing this? Though they — he did not
name the names. The poem does not name names. But I thought — I didn’t know — of
course, already, you see, I was in — connected to the underground, my own —
Q: So —
A: — by distributing leaflets, that is why. And then, this was already under Germans.
And then, somehow it was clear that this was like wrong time to — to publish some —
something like that.
Q: So what you — if I interpret what you’re saying, is that Matuzevicius(ph) was a
poet you admired —
A: Yes.
Q: — before then, with the Soviets, he works underground —
A: Underground, yes.
Q: — against the Soviets, he’s one of “the six.’

educated person, Daukantas. Daukantas. Whom I had never heard about, but I met
him there, in the camp, though he — Germans did that, put — if one — if a Lithuanian
was a general of that stature, ger — Germans, even if that Lithuanian or any other —
from any other country, was of that military stature, Germans respected — had so
much admiration for the army, they used to give them special, individual apartments.
But English did the same. They gave to Daukantas a — a room. It’s this — I ra — and I
met him, and because some of those young army Lithuanians from the German
army, criminals, I — really, they were criminals, introduced me to him, because they
admired, because he was a general. So —
Q: Does he figure in this story? Does he — was he one of those that you would have
had this —
A: No, no.

A: — from the German army, some of them, they were drafted, and we came like that
in the army, those ca — the army can, as — as you know from Vietnam, can change
one into criminal. Some may have even volunteered, who knows? When they were
all released, they were ready to — to — to — to kill, to steal, to continue their criminal

communism, the Soviets.
Q: Okay. Okay.
A: No, because the — the farmers, they were much working with the Jews. The — the
— the all — in Birzai, in Papilys, we depended on them. And I know from our
neighbor, from my mother, fro — they were very [indecipherable] you know, like
part of the family. It was not so — and that kind of the communist rumor, I did not
hear from my farmers, actually, I heard that when I went beg — in the fall, when I
went to the — to th — already back to the studies, in Birzai.
Q: Yeah. I think that —
A: And farmers were very open in — in the — at least northern Lithuania to the — and
there were Jews in every smaller town. And that’s why, you know, when — when
[indecipherable] all 5,000 people in Birzai, and then I hear from Michael that there
were 2,200.
Q: Four hundred.
A: How could it be? Not half of the city I haven’t seen [indecipherable] hundred.
But in the — they were brought from those other little town, that are smaller, like —
like Papilys, and — and they were, you know, sometimes maybe it’s three families.
But sometimes, in some of those small — smaller towns, maybe there were 100.

were not happy that some maybe — I mean, there are all kinds of business sharks in
every r— in every race, in every group. So some — there were Jews, like — like others,
who wanted maybe to make some profit, more profit than they should. But in
general, that was not in the air. It was a [indecipherable] and that in — I would say
Lithi-Lithuania in general, now that’s why we had an — this renaissance of the
Jewish cult — culture, literature, arts, in — in — in Vilnius, in — in Lithuania, and a
century earlier — earlier.
Q: Okay, let’s proceed back to Germany, back to the DP camps, and where you are
about to leave for the united —
A: E-Even in the camps, I was not so involved with was going the camp. We were,
three or four or five of us, interested only in literature, in the arts, we were
publishing, working in that area. And the rest, again, did not exist to us, because we
almost hated the rest of the camp, because to us they were just interested in to go
somewhere, and be — make money, and become successful, and — a-and they were
boring to — all of them. We kept ourselves apart. So, I’m not authority even to — I’m

major part.
A: Yeah, that’s okay, that’s — that —
Q: But, there is one final episode that I’d like to touch upon, and that you already
foreshadowed when you said that you wrote for “Iskusstvo Kino,” and therefore,
became in some ways, not popular in the Lithuanian emigre community. But, it
reestablishes a tie to what then is Soviet Lithuania.

mother told — at some point —

time.
A: In the woods may — means that you joined anti-Soviet — Lithuanian anti-Soviet
partisans.
Q: Okay.
A: So, they figured that I may have joined the partisans, but there may be other —
another reason, because I had also somewhere in — in the maybe fall or winter of — of

the — “Stalin’s Anthem,” I think I called it.
Q: Okay.
A: And it was, you know, ah — very openly against Stalin.
Q: Okay.
A: So, I don’t think they liked that.
Q: Okay. Did you ev — well, when you went back in 1971, that also suggests of
having some special treatment on the part of the Soviets —
A: Yes, as an — as an editor — “Film Culture” magazine — I have to tell you that,
right now, when I’m talking to you, I should be in Berlin.

just a reminder, and that what — what — and that magazine had contri — contributed to
the — to the American film community, and the world. So, in Moscow, of course,
they wanted to know — to have contact with anybody li — ist — ist — “Iskusstvo
Kino,” had to go to “Film Culture.”
Q: And therefore, to you.
A: Came to me, and they kept inviting — inviting me to film festival, because they
want — need coverage. So one time I decided to go, and that’s, of course, another
story. In 1971, that’s when I went. Because I already, by that time, I was cle-clever
enough, and learned enough of a — how the world works, that I thought I can use this
maybe, to visit my mother.
Q: And could you?
A: And I did. But that’s a long story.
