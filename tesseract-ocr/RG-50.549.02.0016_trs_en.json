            "answer": "A few simple words? Leo Bretholz is my name and recording Holocaust stories is my game. Although, I like to stay away from it, base -- I never bring up the subject when we sit. It\u2019s not -- I\u2019m not a -- a dweller on -- on the -- on the events. I don\u2019t exult in the word survivor, because that, to me, is almost like a -- become an object of -- of curiosity. Those who are no longer here, they are the real people that should be paid attention to. Because if we don\u2019t remember them, you know, we\u2019 ll kill them all over again. But the word survivor to me connotes something that\u2019s always a -- a special group and you know, when I speak to people and then they say, \u201cDo you have a number?\u201d I say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a number, because if I were -- had been in a position to get a number, chances are 99 or 999 out of 1000 that I wouldn\u2019t be speaking to you here. So once I don\u2019t have the number, I am no longer that object of curiosity and I\u2019m losing some- I\u2019m lo-losing some credibility, you know. They want to hear that oh, you\u2019re in Auschw -- well, if you\u2019re in Auschwitz, you\u2019re not here to tell the story. Some of them are, but the majority of them are not. It\u2019s enough that I escaped from a train and even that was -- in that train out of -- out of 1000, only seven -- out of 1000, 773 were gassed on This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

            "question": "Let me make sure I\u2019m getting all this on tape. I want to begin with talking about the events, maybe the weeks or days leading up to the end of the war and where you were and what you were doing.",
            "answer": "Well, the end of the -- the days of the end of the war, after I had lived through the liberation in France. Paris was liberated on the 25th of August, 1944. And then the war ended in *45. I was still in France and originally I had papers to come to the United States in 1941, but that was negated by the fact that there was Pearl Harbor and the Americans [indecipherable] entered the war. So, the papers that I had then, which was the affidavit of support, which we got from our relatives here, that expired. And of course after that, I went through all my adventures to deportation and the escape and the jail and everything. But in *45, at the end of the war, I was in France and was awaiting the documents that my aunt, who lived in Baltimore sent me, which is an affidavit of support, at the end of 1946, I received my visa of entry into the United States. And in January of 1947, the 19th of January 1947, I went to LeHavre in France and took the John Erikkson to the United State, a 10 days crossing. And I arrived in New York on the 29th of January, 1947, which is now a little over 51 years. To some people, a lifetime, to me it flew by just like this and it\u2019s hardly to be believed, that\u2019s 51 years have gone by, yes. So I was in France at the end of the -- of -- of the war and came to the United States there. At that point, I didn\u2019t know yet what had happened to my family, although the -- the indications were quite ominous This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection  4 that a tragedy had happened, because we knew already what had happened on the camps and I knew that my mother -- hadn\u2019t heard since \u201842. So that was, to me, an indication. So I came to United States, I -- I was then s-still ignorant of the fact what happened to my mother and sisters."

            "question": "I'd like to ask you about that in -- in a little bit, but do you recall -- I think I re-recall reading something about liberation day and you were in a town in France where they were -- German soldiers were being led through town?",
            "answer": "Yeah, that\u2019s in the book, also. That is in my book, the book will come out at the end of this year -- towards the end of the year now. Probably November of 1998 and the book will be called, \u201cLeap into Darkness - Seven Years on the Run in Wartime Europe\u201d\u2019. It\u2019s co-written by my good friend Michael Oleska, the -- actually, he was the -- he motivated me to write it and then he was editing it f-for me and we did mutual project, was -- it went very well. Taught me a lot and gave me an opportunity. But, at the end of the war, in Limoge, I was in Limoge. That\u2019s where I was when France was liberated. And the garrison, the German oc -- the German garrison in Limoge was not the same as it had been before June of 1944, because some of them were sent to the war front. The landing in Normandy took place on the sixth of June. And on the 10th of June was the burning of the village of Orodure, to which I was a -- almost witness, because I was on my way there and got off the train when I saw a German transport going there and I didn\u2019t want to go into the same direction. That village was burned to the ground and all it\u2019s inhabitants, except a few, burned with the village. And I was just about maybe 10 - 15 miles away This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Everyone that had a ticket for Orodure, to get off, which I had -- was taken into station, was part of that massacre. So there again, I was lucky in a great, great way. You see, my escape is not so much survival and -- and that\u2019s why I say I don\u2019t exult in it. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a question of -- of fear and luck. The fear is the motivater and then you got to be lucky for -- for it to succeed or to -- to get away. So, that was just -- before the liberation, after the liberation, we had these -- the remnant of the German garrison in -- in- in Limoge. They were taken down the main street, down towards the station by a ragtag outfit of the resistance, whom the Germans considered dispensable, just a few weeks earlier. And here, this ragtag outfit that didn\u2019t have matching shoes, had the nerve. Anything to -- to -- to -- to hold on to basically, except their pride and their joy that the - now, the war -- the end of the war came. Those Germans acted like little sheep, you know. Their -- a few weeks earlier they were the masters and at that moment they walked with their hands on top of their heads and looking scared. Why? Because they\u2019re human beings. And some of them were young. I mean they were in the hands of these underground people and they knew that these undergrounds had a bone to pick with them. They knew that wh-wh-wh-when we are in their hands, we are not in the hands of  of a -- of -- of an enemy\u2019s ha -- high command, where they have to deal with -- with protocol and war amenities. The amenities of exchanging and of fairness, imprisonment. These -- these underground, th-the -- the resistance, they were bent on -- on vengeance."

The -- the Sixth was a group that was engaged in clandestine performances, like doing false identification cards and -- and documents. We did that already, before the liberation. But, we were all under a -- taking orders. Some were connected with the FTPF, they were called. In French it\u2019s Front Tereur Partisain Francais. Front tereur means snipers or guerrillas. Partisain -- partisans, you know. They were a tough -- oh, how do you say it? Rough, rock and tumble outfit. They didn\u2019t go by -- by orders or by command. There was another group was called FFI, the Force Francais L\u2019Interiore. The French Forces of the Interior. They took orders from DeGaulle in London. And there was this conflict between the two groups. The one wanted to go the -- the legal -- the -- the proper way. The other said, \u201cWe're going to get the enemy whichever way we can.\u201d So this -- this was the group. And under -- we were usually under these orders. But the partisans that arrested the Germans, they were the ones that had come out of the woods carrying their rifles. Some of the rifles -- most of the rifles were not loaded. But the rifle looked good and inspired - if -- if -- if not fear, at least respect."

            "question": "Mm-hm. You -- you were feeling euphoric, yourself?",
            "answer": "Yeah, yeah. The mood was euphoric. And then with it came a sobering moment, mixed in with that euphoria. That while the war is finished, there are families somewhere from whom we hadn\u2019t heard. So, to us this was the beginning of a new chapter of finding out and searching. And being here dealing with things. When Paris was liberated, in \u201844  in August \u00b044, we knew that Germany was not defeated yet. In fact, that same year, in the -- in the fall, came the Battle of the Bulge. And in that counter attack by the Germans, they advanced far enough for Paris to feel that there might be another -- a re-occupation. That never happened. The allies -- allies prevailed. But that was that moment. Germans were still kicking -- alive and kicking. And when the landing took place in \u201844, during that period, in June of \u201844, the deportations from southern France, from Vichy, France towards Drancy and Auschwitz were still going on. So even that euphoric moo-mood, about the landings, had to be tempered with -- with the knowledge that people are still being sent away. But then when -- when -- in 1945, in May of \u201845, the armistice was signed, there was a different attitude. Now, we knew that the war was ended and we had to deal with the aftermath. For many of us, that had to do with family, because we had left our families and loved ones and some of it -- some of them left with their families, but in the process of fleeing, of going to France and living on the Vichy, some of those fa-families had been separated. Young men were hiding out while their parents were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And finally he got back to his Judaism, because he -- he was converted by the padres and -- no, bu -- bu -- no, he went to a -- not to a con -- he went to a monastery, I think. So anyway, we all had to deal with these things and knowing that the war was over was very good, but there was the family\u2019s story and the history of -- and the aspect of -- of dealing with it -- dealing with it from emotional standpoint because we -- we -- it was the great uncertainty, who had survived and who had not survived."

At that moment I was -- in 1946, I was 25 years old, I had survived the war. I had received my papers to come to America. And frankly I was looking forward to getting away from the continent there. It had not been too kind to me, to say the least and of course, France, beautiful country. Countries are always beautiful, 1t\u2019s what the people do that\u2019s not so good, often, you know.

And that\u2019s what I was dealing with. I did not dwell too much on the fact that I better stay in Europe and try to find my mother and sisters, because I had reached out to Red Cross and other agencies and I never heard anything. And of course at that time, the communication system had not developed to the point where you knew who had survived, who had not survived. So I -- I wanted to be just getting away from there and I knew that staying there wouldn\u2019t advance anything from me emotionally, because I\u2019d only be still under the -- the impact of what happened to me. And I looked forward to make a break. And that\u2019s what happened. I came to the United States. I did not dwell too much on the sentimentality.

So on the icicles that were hanging on the -- on the railing started melting and the waves were pretty high, I was one sitting there where this fella that played on the piano, he was a -- quite an artist.

And this young man walked down with her, carrying her suitcase. And actually big suitcases were taken in by the porters for the customs, but these little handbags carrying something for her.

My aunt, my father\u2019s sister, Aunt Sophie. And ma -- Aunt Minna and Uncle Sam, whom I had been with in Luxembourg after I escaped from Vienna.

I hadn\u2019t had much chance to even tell him -- we had a chance, but not much chance to communicate about these years that had past, in between, in the interim. So, but -- end of February -- a month after I came here, I worked for Barnes Clothing, down on Baltimore Street and was my first job and I joined the textile company. Some people say I should have gone to college and furthered my education. Which would have been alright if \u2019'd had enough money to pay rent.

Then came the very hard winter in -- in -- 1n \u201c47, was a hard winter, which is fine, but then the very hot summers in Baltimore, which were very oppressive for me, I cannot tolerate the heat too much.

So the first year in America, I had second thoughts and the correspondence I had with my aunt in Paris and with some of the friends was that there is a possibility I may come back. In the back of my head, there was also still -- and that I couldn\u2019t help -- the idea of my mother and sisters. And in America I was far away from it, so the combination of not quite acclimating immediately to the American culture and the climate, plus the fact that I was still laboring with the thoughts of what had happened to my family, because this -- there was this guilt from the moment that I left them, in \u201838, although my mother urged me to leave."

We are -- because in those days women were not still involved in a two -- two family earning pattern and so women stayed home and -- more in those days. So they had time during the day to go out, instead of going in a -- go to a coffee clutch, they went to have a meeting in a -- in -- in a church or a synagogue or in a school. The men were working during the day, so we got together in the evenings, or on weekends. I never forget -- we went to Washington a snowy morning. On a weekend [indecipherable] to the Omni -- it was I think Omnibus. It was a -- in Washington there was a program called Omnibus. We went to Arlington, Virginia, a few blocks down from -- from a -- a - Rockwell\u2019s. Rockwell\u2019s headquarters, the Nazi Rockwell. In -- on -- on Wilson Boulevard. What was his first name? Lincoln Rockwell. He was the -- the American Nazi. They flew the flag there, the Nazi flag on Wilson Boulevard. I once wrote about that and said, \u201cOur troops went to Europe to -- to get the Nazi flag down from the Eiffel Tower, to the Acropolis in Greece and you come to Arlington and you see a -- you see an- a swastika flying.\u201d Whether it\u2019s in Arlington, Virginia or in Lincoln, Nebraska, you know. Anyway, that was the group that we formed and so I found -- I found my -- my voice. And then in 1962, I got notified by the Vienna Jewish community, that the names of my mother and sisters do not appear on the list of those who have returned. In the book I call it quite a euphemism. Instead of saying they were murdered at Auschwitz, their names are not listed -- do not appear on the list of those who have returned. You know, that\u2019s a nice way of saying it. But by that time I\u2019d found out what happened to my mother and sisters and I could begin to reconcile things although the guilt stayed with me This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And he said to me, you know, \u201cIf your mother were able to come back for just a moment -- 1f she were coming back for just an hour maybe and -- and say one sentence to you, she would probably say, \u201cI\u2019m glad I urged you to leave.\u2019\u201d\u2019 Because it was she who urged me to leave Vienna in 1938. She was the one. If not for her, I would not maybe have gotten my stuff together and left. B-But she says, \u201cYou must go because for men, for boys, this is not a place to be.\u201d See, she was very prescient."

I look at it with some sort of a solemn feeling that perhaps, perhaps by the f -- most farfetched possibility, one of those shoes belonged to my mother or my sisters.

And a cousin that had survived who was an Austrian, she met us in Switzerland. I write about that. And as we came to Paris and spoke to my aunt and - and then my other relatives that were still in Belgium since then, my uncle died, my aunt died, my cousin. Time takes it\u2019s toll.

But in general, I did not elaborate too much on -- on it, because I didn\u2019t want to dwell too much on it.

And Flo was always very, very understanding in these things and very compassionate about these things. Much more than the average person I would think.

In fact, one of her first friends, girlfriends in -- in Baltimore was a girl -- a young woman who -- who had survived a -- a camp and -- and came back after the war, from Sweden.

But we, because we had it, we have become better for it. We understand what it is and when you understand something, you apply it in your life and you become better for it. But that isn\u2019t the case. So I said, \u201cHave you become better for 1t? Look at the Moloccans. A cab driver wouldn\u2019t pick him up to take him to his apartment, because he says he is going to Battonfeld and Battonfeld is one of the suburbs where the Moloccans live, or the Moroccans. So the cab driver would say I can\u2019t take you. This is -- have you become better?\u201d And this is the arguments that I had with them, you know? That\u2019s where I stood up for America. And I was proud to do that. I said to Flo, \u201cNow, let\u2019s get back to America and relax. Now we are Americans, we know what\u2019s good about it, we know what\u2019s bad about it and we know what we want to change and we know what we can\u2019t change. And we know that it will always be the same, basically, f -- because people are people.\u201d But the times have evolutioned, you know. But in Holland, we had to stand up for America.

And the Holocaust shaped me to the extent that there is a realization that unless you assert yourself in the face of hatred and adversity, you will -- you will become a victim eventually. Now, you have to stand up for what\u2019s right when your neighbor is being maligned, and your fellow man discriminated against. That\u2019s the way we raised our kids.

That- that is my conviction, because we lost a million and a half children. A million and a half children. As somebody wrote -- a woman wrote, Gerta Weissman Klein wrote that they\u2019re ordinary children, but a lot of them could have become very extraordinary. Luxembourg is a nation with 350,000 people or 400,000 people. There were a million and a half children who could have grown into a nation of 30 or 40,000,000, had they been allowed to live, but they didn\u2019t. Had there been a state of Israel, these children would not have died. In that respect, yes. With other things, I can disagree with Netanyahu, but he was elected. And perhaps the -- the labor government is more acceptable to a lot of people, because they were, perhaps, more -- more amenable. But Rabine also was not a man who was going to have his country commit suicide. I am sure he was not that kind of a man. In fact, Rabine was a general and Netanyahu was not.

But, while it was in -- in it\u2019s infancy, then the -- the -- the idea, it -- it became -- it became a - a dire necessity after the Holocaust, simply because -- because the proof was there, that nobody -- nobody was accepting the Jews. The world knew about it. The -- the ship Saint Louis came to the American coast in 1939 and Gustov Shroeder, the captain with the swastika on his lapel, called the Coast Guard, ship to shore, pleading with them, \u201cLet - don\u2019t let me take these people back.\u201d He was crying, a Nazi.

See, the hills were there, the buildings were there, the trees were there, but the heart and soul was gone and all those who could have made a difference, namely people and faces and arms clutching you -- that was not there. So you -- so you had a -- a very traumatic -- I went back in -- that was 1970. I went back in \u201892, that was already different and I went back in \u201896 to Vienna, that was almost -- well, almost reconciled. And Flo enjoyed it very much in 1996 also, when we were invited by the Vienna government to come. [indecipherable] welcome service. This is a sort of a make up to us, you know, in a way. But it was very enjoyable, in a way, that I went back to some of the places, took some photos. And Flo keeps saying, \u201cYou know, I would like to go back to Vienna.\u201d And I -- I would go -- I would go back, in fact I -- I have a cousin who still lives there. She\u2019s about my age, about a year younger. But will we or won\u2019t we, I don\u2019t know. I believe we will.

Because I -- in the face of adversity, I -- I did not give up and I think escaping from a train 1s probably a -- a great form of resistance. And there\u2019s not many that did that. Because we were going to hell, straight to hell. So that was 19 -- I said 1970 1992 -1996, we went back. And I would like to, as I said, go back again. If you want to know any more details about -- there was not much there. I -- I roamed through the streets of Vienna, went back to the synagogue, which was no longer there, where I was Bar Mitzvahed. This 1s now an apartment building and it has a plaque outside, designating it as a scene of a conflagration, destroyed by the Nazi hordes. It\u2019s an apartment building. So I\u2019m watching this and I\u2019m reading this and a lady coming out of the house, this building, she sees us and she says, \u201cCan I help you in any way? Looking for anything?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, this is the place that I went to say my prayers when I lived in this area.\u201d \u201cOh, oh.\u201d And she walked away, because she\u2019s now a tenant in that place. And then steps back for one moment and she says, \u201cI want you to know, we are living on a holy ground here.\u201d So she admitted that to herself, that this used to be a synagogue and to her, her apartment building is -- has been erected on holy ground, you know. The Austrians are 99.9 Catholics. And I knew -- probably knew just as much about Catholicism when I lived in Austria as I knew about my own religion. But that\u2019s what it was, that was the reaction there. Others were nice and -- and forthcoming. There were other people who were standoffish and didn\u2019t want to hear about it.

Between man and man, not with man and God, because if you do good by your fellow man, you do good by God. We don\u2019t have a middle man, but I was never a very practicing Jew.

Often -- often, my wife and I talk and we say we wish we could have really been stronger involved in -- in religious venues. Although the holidays are kept. I never worked on a Jewish holiday. I made it a point not to. And I wanted to maintain that. When a -- when -- on Passover, I am very strict about not eating bread, because again, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s perhaps a symbolism, but it makes me what I am.

The Jamaicans are very religious, they\u2019re very Christian. Then when we got to that place where he took us, at a vantage point like a -- a vista, I took him like on the side and I said, \u201cWhy did you ask me that? Why did that make any difference?\u201d And I said to him, \u201cDo you know if Christ came back on earth today and he came to Jamaica --\u201d Oh, I ask him, \u201cTs there a synagogue in Jamaica?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, in Kingston. It\u2019s one of the oldest in the west.\u201d I said, \u201cYou see, if Christ were coming back today to Jamaica, he would look for that synagogue to go to, not to your church.\u201d I had to come back to him some - somehow. I said, \u201cWe are all -- we are all the same. Christ was Jewish.\u201d I had to give this man a lesson. Why did he pick -- why did he pick on me? You know, people never actually -- not knowingly, take me for Jewish. They think I am Lebanese, Greek, Italian, what else -- South American. Because of my coloration maybe, my skin color. \u201cBut, what difference does it make,\u201d I told him. And, \u201cYes I am.\u201d I will never deny it.

But, being that I have been persecuted as a Jew, I think it\u2019s a duty to be committed as a Jew for the rest of my life. Because they wanted me to be gone and I have survived and if I am not what I am and show what I am, I\u2019m giving them a victory. That would be posthumous victory, wouldn\u2019t it? If I say, no, I want to give up my Judaism, that\u2019s all that Hitler would want. Hey, take Isaac Bashivasinger, the writer. The Yiddish language was supposed to have been obliterated. And they were supposed to brag about that later, what they did to that culture. And there he comes and writes and wins the Nobel Prize for literature, writing in the Yiddish language. If Hitler had been alive then, he would have committed suicide again. Because this language was no -- was not supposed to have survived. So that is what you call it, a vindication. A -- an assertion. You\u2019re here, you live and one of the phrases that the Jews always sing in the song and you may have heard that in Hebrew. Have you heard Im Israelhaim? The Jewish people who lives is alive.
