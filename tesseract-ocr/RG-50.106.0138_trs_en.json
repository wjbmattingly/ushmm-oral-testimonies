And so she went to the school and she complained that we are misbehaving and all that kind of stuff, and then the teacher called us in and then the principal called us in, and then the teacher said \u2014 cause she went to the principal and then the principal told the teacher that \u2014 what kind of children she\u2019s bringing up. Course, that was a class of 40 kids, so she couldn\u2019t really watch over everyone. But she says to us, why did you push them, or did you push her? And somebody says, because she 1s a Jew. And the teacher said, uh-uh, then you would push Holy Mary in the ditch too. No, never. How would we? She said, oh yes you would, and you would put Jesus in a ditch, too. And we said why? She says, because they were Jews. And of course, nobody ever told us that, you know, you always talk about all this other stuff. And we had a religion class every day, so the Jewish girls went to school, th-they had a free period, and then on \u2014 when they had to go to school, I think on Sunday they had their religious school, so for religion they went to their own rabbi. And so there was \u2014 I had an afet \u2014 uncle who was an atheist, and he all \u2014 and this preacher \u2014 I mean, this religion teacher always says, any questions?

And he say, yeah, and his mother and his apostles and the first Christians were Jews. And then I say, how come we never knew about it, you know. But anyhow, I think that from that moment on, mine attitude toward Jews was changed. You know there was that, before when I \u2014 when I looked \u2014 course, you couldn\u2019t tell who was a Jew if they were not having the itzkeys(ph) and all that kind of stuff, and the mitzkeys(ph) on top, or howarts(ph) with all this stuff, you couldn't tell. But then since that time I keep looking, you know, whether I \u2014 cause there was this stupid idea that I recognize Jesus in one of them, but I mean \u2014 anyhow, that\u2019s how my attitude \u2014 I never had any non-attitude toward Jews since they were my school friends, okay, and school friends don\u2019t talk about religion. You talk about your school things, and your girl things and you don\u2019t talk about big things. But since then I\u2014I was more friendly, and how would I say? Yeah, more interested, you know.

And before we go on about your experiences in the United States, I just wanted to ask you another question about the DP camps. Did you have any contact with Jewish survivors, and if so did you feel any connection to them, or did you see any difference?",
            "answer": "There were absolutely no Jewish D \u2014 displaced persons because they were in a separate camp. And so \u2014 but I knew some friends that once in awhile I would meet, but they were just in different locations and ju \u2014 only once in awhile I would see them, they would come and visit, but that was [indecipherable] or I go and visit. But otherwise we had no \u2014 since we all had to have passes to leave the camp, you couldn\u2019t leave the camp without the pass and all that, and you have to prove why you have to go and all this sort of thing. And I always lied and I said, well, I have to see family, I found somebody, and all that kind of stuff. But otherwise you just wouldn\u2019t get the pass. So I \u2014 it was difficult really to \u2014 to \u2014 to go by train or anyplace like that. It was easy, it was like another camp except that it was so called free camp, but it was also very limited.

And so he \u2014 I did work, and of course when the time came \u2014 by the time I got this certificate I have to come to the immigration office, and so when they learned that I working for a consulate and for the Polish Trade and Commerce later on, well somebody told me, don\u2019t work for the consulate because they might take you back to Poland or persecute your family if you don\u2019t go back, and they switched me to this new office, commerce and trade representative\u2019s office.

And so he says well \u2014 just then somebody who was asking me says, well did you get money for it? And I said, why should I have gotten money for it?

But it says, no women wanted or somethi \u2014 only from \u2014 only for men. I don\u2019t remember the wording on this thing. And so, as I pass by, the two old ladies were sitting on a porch and I look at the sign and I pass by. And one of them gets up and she says, aren\u2019t you gonna come in? And I say, why I\u2019m a woman, I can\u2019t come in. And I was dressed up, you know, to kill. And so what are you looking for? And I say, well, I\u2019m looking for a place, because I live in Ferguson, it\u2019s too far for me to school, between work and school. She says, well, why don\u2019t you look at the room? So, take me up. She took me upstairs and I went upstairs and this and that and I said, well how about cooking facilities? And she says, well, we don\u2019t let anybody cook, but if you promise that you never leave any dirty dishes and that you \u2014 and we give you a little place. She evidently liked me, okay?

So there was the \u2014 he says, well the only other job he says, to wash dishes.

And she said, how do you know about Hanukah? And I said well, I come from a place that has every fra \u2014 fifth person is a Jew, so you have to know about Hanukkah.

Because there were \u2014 but however it\u2019s difficult because before the Gestapo and the SS left, they burned most of their materials. So it\u2019s very difficult to \u2014 to really find somebody. You can never find names, for example, of \u2014 right after the war, when Poland lost the war, all the Jewish synagogues were burned, and po \u2014 Jewish population\u2019s registers was kept by \u2014 by the synagogues, the birth and the marriage records and all that. So once the synagogue was burned, that was it. And ben \u2014 then besides, since the Jews never lived together with the Poles, or the very few Pole \u2014 Poles knew the Jews and the Jews knew the Poles. They only knew each other in commercial situations, but not that I could go \u2014 some \u2014 somebody could swear yeah, I know this \u2014 this Jew came from this and this place, or this. So we can\u2019t really find anybody like that. Besides, what they did sometimes, they got this whole Jewish population on the side of some river or something and shot them, or whatever it was. And in the very beginning it was like that. And \u2014 course they didn\u2019t use them for work like they did later, they just got smarter [indecipherable] smarter in quotation marks. And so it\u2019s \u2014 so we were looking for these people, but it\u2019s very difficult to find it, especially women. But seems like men, who were then put to work, were easier to trace, whereas women and children were shot before they were even put to work or anything like that, so \u2014 so what we did, we would just write out the names and professions and where they were born and all that, and you think possible that could facilitate the finding.

Nobody ever \u2014 I don\u2019t know somebody \u2014 I wrote to the paper and was published, too.

And there were \u2014 then you knew that someplace between one place and the other, there could have been a child who was dropped through the floor. And then the \u2014 somebody would see to it that the child was picked up. And this was all organized, and I think it was organized by the present pope, I think, of \u2014 he wasn\u2019t a pope then, of course.

And yet, it\u2019s just because I\u2019m saying I\u2019m Polish, the mother says, huh oh. I mean, it happens very often. I mean, in Red Cross there was this new worker there and she says to me, ah, the Poles were so horrible to the Jews, killed them during \u2014 and she is not even Jewish. And she says \u2014 and I said, who told you stuff like that? Absolute there were people like that, but they weren\u2019t any better than the J-Jewish O.D. I mean, you know what O.D. is? Ordnungsdienst, so the Jewish police. I mean, it was just as cruel as the Polish police or anybody else. I mean, and you \u2014 nobody \u2014 they were more hated in the ghetto some \u2014 for example, than \u2014 than even the Polish police, cause you can always bribe the Polish police. And of course I understand the \u2014 the Ordnungsdienst, or the yi \u2014 Jewish police, they wanted to stay alive, so \u2014 I mean, this whole idea was that everybody who was in this situation had to \u2014 wanted to survive, and the will to survive makes you do things that \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Of course, ther \u2014 you were always promised you\u2019re gonna stay alive longer.

I don\u2019t know what I would do, if I were pushed toward the wall. If my back was toward the wall, what would I do? And for God to judge people. I don\u2019t know if we have the right to do it.

Oh no, of course not. And so that\u2019s why I sit down to write the book, but you know how \u2014 I was teaching and raising a son, I didn\u2019t have that much time to write a book. But so he never read it because he died in \u201976, so \u2014 so he never read it. But then once I started it, somebody says no, so what, don\u2019t leave us like \u2014 don\u2019t leave us \u2014 tell us what happened.

What\u2019s the ending, can \u2014 oh yeah, I remember I gave it to some Jewish couple to read and they said, well, can\u2019t you write about some happy times?

And so I\u2019m not gonna wait for that, okay\u2019? The fact is that I put down something so that those who come after us knows what this generation of us went through and yet somehow survived. And I think that the reason why we really survive is the 20 years of po \u2014 Polish independence, cause then we were \u2014 after the 123 years of being taken by Russians, Prussians and Austrians, in this free Poland, the Pilsudski\u2019s free Poland, we \u2014 it was imbued in this crowd of the old Poland, and I always was in this camp of this nation of a ma \u2014 kingdom or republic of free nations, you know how that if you le \u2014 stick together instead of quarrel, you can be somebody. And I always wanted Poland to be multi-culture and multi-religious. And I had this teacher who always \u2014 in elementary school, who always complain how dumb the Polish government is and those national democrats and all and this \u2014 and so finally \u2014 and we finally said well, can you tell us when Poland was really big?
