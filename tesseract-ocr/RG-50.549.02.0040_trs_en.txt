A: I cannot say that -- how it would be without her, because I’ve always known one life,
and that was with my grandmother, and in a big family with -- with four cousin, which
was more like brothers and sisters, and I had a very wonderful childhood. We lived in a
big house, three stores high. My grandfather, he had passed away at that time, but he had
-- had had a hotel in Elsinore, our neighbor town, and my grandmother was reasonable
well off, and we had a wonderful life, and with much love. Of course that was -- might
be a little bit more old fashioned. There were some thing which I saw later on, that our
maids could do, that we were not allowed to do, but really we don’t miss it. We had a
very nice, very beautiful childhood together.
Q: What were some of the things that you weren’t allowed to do? How was your
grandmother old fashioned?
A: Five o’clock, was five o’clock, and when she had said something, she was a female
dictator, so she was ra-rather strict, but I-I don’t remember any time she hit any of us. It
wasn’t necessary, yeah. A blink with eyes, a finger lifted.
Q: [inaudible]
A: That’s okay. So -- But w-we were not a-afraid of something, no, no, no, no, but that
was the way -- that was the rule of the house and they -- the rules we had might be -- was
a little different from -- from others. There was also a generation, and different from the
way our maids were brought up and the way we were.
Q: Well, your sister was there, so your grandmother was bringing up six children?
A: Yes.

Q: Okay. So she -- Tell me a little bit more about her. What was she like?
A: She was a very heartful lady. She did new -- what she could do for helping people. But
still she had -- she was Swedish, so there a difference between Swedish and Danish. The
Swedes are lay -- almost stiff, and -- in their way of life, and she came to Denmark, very
youn -- young and married my grandfather and they made together this wonderful hotel,
and -- and she has always been in a commanding position, and she was that to her last
day. So -- But our home was full of love and we had all the things we wanted to have to
play. We had the big garden. We lived in Snagerstein, that 1s three miles south of
Elsinore. We had -- From our windows we could see over the sounds of Sweden. We --
Every summer, we -- we wot out swimming and sailing. We had the boat very near to us,
so we had it, really, a wonderful life. So -- A-And she was, of course, the manager of all
the things, who make it possible.
Q: You said that she was -- that she gave things, that she reached out to people. Can --
Can you talk a little bit about that, what you remember of her as you were growing up?
A: No, really, I dow -- just know that people came and -- and what -- what they got, I
don’t know. But I know during the war, she was very helpful in many ways to people
who had no clothes, because she gave, of course, what we ha-have left over -- be -- so,
she -- she was very h-heartly in -- in her way of living. But the small details is difficult to
remember.
Q: What do you recall about religion, growing up, or faith? Did you go to church, or were
there any habits or rituals at home, that you recall?

A: My home was a typical Danish four wheel Christian life. You know, you go to church
when you on f-four wheels, for baptism, for wedding, confirmation, funeral and
Christmas eve. We were not -- Of course, we believed, but we were not church-goer, not
church-goer. We -- No, I -- I really think that the only religious influence in the house
was that grandma, every morning, 8:30, listened to the radio from the dume in
Copenhagen, there was every day, a -- a 10 minute sermon. And that -- that was -- But,
we were not church-goer. First of all, there was quite a long distance to church. And, by
the way, my grandmother was not very fond of the minister. He was from what we -- I
would call a very Orthodox, and very narrow minded part of the Danish church, called
Internal Mission. That, you know, everything was prohibited, but you were allowed to
put cream and shoke in the coffee, but not ter.
Q: Not to stir it?
A: Thas -- Hey wa -- Tha -- That’s the right, that’s right, that -- that part of -- of course it
not -- not true with the coffee, but in that way, that everything was s-sinful. And that was
too Orthodox for my grandma. And th-the sermons from the radio, that was something
else, that was a more Reformed, and open form of religion. But, of course, the religions,
the bages should be the same, bus all the outfits, which make the difference.
Q: What -- You’ve talked a little bit about the love in your household, and the -- the s --
the structure, the discipline. What else do you remember about values your grandmother
taught you, or perhaps a sort of a philosophy, as you were growing up?

Q: There was no [indecipherable] kind of -- I really think that she thought that if we did
what she did, it was okay [indecipherable] example. I -- I just think that’s -- that was her
idea. She was not a -- a big thinker. We had too much to do, but she was a good pe -- a
good -- a good woman, and we loved her, and so I have had a childhood which was quite
out of this world. When I hear about what’s going on [indecipherable] well, that’s a -- I
enjoy to think back a-at that time.
Q: What did your grandmother do all day? You said there was some financial resources,
was she working at all, fro -- a garden, or anything?
A: I understand you are a young American. If you have tol -- as-asked this to -- to a
Danish girl in that age, “I have six children, I have a big house, and you say wh -- ask
what I do?” I really think that -- We had, of course -- There was an aunt living with us, a-
and she was so wonderful, and wa -- that was my grandfather’s sister, never married, and
was -- was the lady who took care of the kitchen and all this. And then we h -- always
had a girl, a maid. But those ga -- a -- a big garden, you know. That was the only thing I
hated, it was to pick up the leaves from the -- the -- the leaves of roses. That was a big,
and a boring job. But there was a big garden, and my -- my grandmother was very
interested in -- in gardens. So, she got plenty to do, plenty to do.
Q: I want to talk a little bit about politics. I mean, did -- did you ever hear politics
discussed at the dinner table? What -- What were y -- her ideals, or perhaps even yours?
At this point, you’re 13 -14 - 15. How were you getting some of your political ideas? A-

A-And it doesn’t have to be specifically with a specific party, but just ideas about how
things should be.
A: You see that, in Denmark, we ha -- for all the years when I was young, mixed
government between the social democrats and a radical party. And, you must recall that,
in the 30’s, after the Black Wednesday in ’29, Denmark had had very -- indeed, very bad
economical conditions. A big part of our -- our export was agriculture, and the first --
everybody stopped in Britain, was our biggest market, that was agriculture products. So
there was a really big unemployment in Denmark in the beginning of the 30’s, and there
was, even then, not any tension t -- revolution or to Communism, all this, because there
was a social welfare in Denmark. A social welfare, which was backed up even by the
more conservative parties, so there was uni -- unity about -- to give the people who was
not so good off as we, a helping hand. And after ’36, it turns a little bit, and in °38, just
before the war, we had a reasonable good situation, and of course the social democrat got
the credit for that, and that is okay. And, at the same time, a certain Mr. Hitler, made his
number in -- in Germany. We thought that Hitler was a clown. We und-underestimated
that guy. His screaming, his completely directed reviews. He -- When we saw him in the
picture -- the pictures of him, when we -- when we heard him in -- in the radio, on -- on
film, or this newsreels, it was -- w-we couldn’t understa -- we really thought the man
must be crazy. And that gave Denmark an injection against narcissism, because that was
also completely foolish for us to believe that anybody are supermen. I never forget, we as
Danes, was so -- the best of all the Aryans, with our blue eyes, our blonde hair, and -- and

all this. And we couldn’t u-understand anything out of -- and therefore, in Denmark, there
was a feeling of certainness, that that guy could never be a threat. That was °36 - °37.
There was a -- that w -- I say, here was not something I knew that time, because as 10
years old, you are not that interest. But, the [indecipherable] was that when he had passed
the bridge over Rhine, the river Rhine, and taking over the old German socketbeat
without, and he was shooting at him. Maybe the whole world could have -- be something
else today, this day in April, in ’99, where we talk about Kosovo. If somebody had shot at
the German army crossing the bridges over Rhine in 1936, maybe millions of people had
been alive today. I don’t know, but I say it because that gis -- my impression what’s right
or wrong in Kosovo.
Q: Do you remember when you first began to form your own idea about Hitler? Do you
remember listening to the radio, perhaps with your grandmother, or aunt, or perhaps other
people, neighbors, or --
A: I can say the day exactly, the ninth of April, 1940, I woke up and -- because there was
airplanes in the air. We had -- To see an airplane in that -- the -- in those days, that was
something special, but here was lots of them, coming up from south, over the river Sund,
and they were -- the destination were Norway, because that was the day Hitler occupied
Denmark and Norway. And then they came back and they -- then went over Copenhagen,
and we have heard about the bombardment of Wachau, in the year before, when the start
of the war started, and afterwards, we got the -- the message that Hitler has threatened to
bomb Copenhagen if we did not -- gave up and sign the treaty that let -- he should take

over the power and -- and all this. And we had that time, 13,000 soldier, that was all, and
somebody was killed at the -- at the border between Ge-Germany and Denmark. That day
I got my impression what -- a man who have made a non-aggressive treaty with us, and
broke it, that man was no good, and he was certainly not a clown, but he was a threat.
And from the -- that day, I -- I despised the man, and the regime. But I think that goes for
many, many, many. I was 13 years, that ni-ninth of April, and it was strange because I
had to go to the station. I went to school in Copenhagen, that was a dri -- a drive of about
an hour or so, and non -- in the train, I’ve heard about it. We have to -- seen the planes
and all this, but when we came to the -- to Copenhagen, we had to stop one station before
Norbel, and w-w-w -- had to go out of the train and up in the streets, we heard the
German soldiers. And that was a shock. I was really in shock. And -- But we could do
nothing. [indecipherable] dreams that you can have a gun and shoot, all that. Well, wund
-- it became a normal day later. Where we lived, we saw no German soldiers. I saw them
when I was a-at school in Copenhagen, and I really think Denmark 1s a sha -- I remember
that’s the first time in all our history, we have lost all freedom. And I know it s-seems
maybe a little pathetic, but freedom is something you don’t talk about, and don’t know
exists until you lose it. Then you’ll find out what it means. This -- To live, one day ina
country with law and order, the next in a country where you do not know what is law and
order, because the other set up what you have to be and say, that is difficult. All this --
For instance, with the news. From one day to another, we just had one side of the news.
And that was the main reason that we young people, of course, guided by grown-ups,

came in -- very young in the illegal press work. As paper boys, we distributed -- and to
me it was very clear. I went to school in Copenhagen, I lived on the country side in -- in
Willet, so it was naturally I had some papers with me, and gave them to people who I
knew would en -- would use them right, because that was all informations. W-W-We
tried to listen to BBC, but the Germans make some disturbings jop, so it was very
difficult. You should have seen all the antennas you tried to make, in order to get the
news from BBC, three times a day. And, again, BBC was the truthful news media. But,
maybe they’ll be just as muss -- misunderstandings from their side. Beeb -- The -- The
German’s news from the different fronts, was always taken as 100 percent lies. But on
the other side, in the fort -- in ’40, what happened? Holland, Belgium, France fell.
Dunkirk. It was a very, very sad time. It was very difficult to keep up this stee. That was -
- And our government, we had a government at that time, the-they make collaboration
with the Germans, which we didn’t like. We -- We thought they were cowards. That’s
easy to say when you are not sitting at the fir -- in the first row, but that was a very
shameful feeling, that we have failed, that we now saw that England was very, very hard
pressed, and there was none in Europe, who could help. Never forget that on -- in the ’40,
they had still the pact between Stalin and Hitler. It was just -- there was no way out of it.
Q: C-Can -- Can you talk a little bit more about people felt about how your government
reacted, and what they would have liked to have seen?
A: I think that most people, they thought, oh hey, comme ci, comme ¢a, it’s going. We
have still our steak every Sunday, and we have st -- still that and that. That’s -- It’s not

that bad, and that’s -- But, the young people, who had -- out from the -- the point of
shame, some other interest. We wanted something should happen. Of course, most of the
people of that part, were quite young. They had no responsibilities. I cannot today
understand that maybe I would had another meaning, another opinion of things, if I’ve --
had been married, and two or three kids. But, we thought that we did too little to show
that Denmark should again be a free country. And that was -- But on the other side, every
b -- I think that some Danes believed that Hitler will win the war. But there were never a
great Nazi party in Denmark. The two -- two and a half percent, that was -- maybe three,
was -- and many of them came because -- and that -- that’s completely crazy --because of
the pact between Germany and Soviet Union. And Soviet Union’s attack on Finland.
There was a fro -- Finnish feelings in Denmark, and we really found that Soviet Union
and Germany were the same bad taste. And some people, they went to fight against
Russia in Finland and some of these people later on, when Hitler attacked Russia in 1941,
joined Hitler, in order to -- it should benefit Finland. Finland joined Hitler in that war.
But there was this northern feelings for a -- a brother land, and -- but that -- that was only
a few people in Denmark, most --

A: The most people, they were completely indifferent. But then, time went on and we,
from the [inaudible] started with distributing illegal papers, now started to print them
themself. We got a -- a dummy from -- from one place in Copenhagen, had, by different
person, got paper. That was a very big proten, to get paper for it, and then we made a
copy, which we otherwise would have brought hundreds copies, then we made more self,
and that’s -- that was our very, very brave assistance, [indecipherable]
Q: I want to go through this step by step. Can you first remember wh-when this idea
arose? A-And you talk about we, wh-who is we? If you could tell me who these people
were, and -- and if you can think back, were you sitting around and you decided that, let’s
do this, or did someone approach you?
A: No, be -- Yes, 1-it was -- the first thing was, that at my school in Copenhagen, that was
the oldest school in de -- in Denmark, me -- the Metropolitan school. We had very good
teachers. It was very national school, a very Anglo-Saxon kind of school, and there was --
there they started with connection to the university. And s -- one of my schoolmates had
some of these papers, it -- brought to the school sometimes, and I said, “Can I have
some?” Yes, and then it start in that way, and we were influenced by our teachers, very
much indeed. And they -- to them, it was very important, because they were academic.
They were Latin, Greek people. They could do that, they were experts -- they we -- were
-- because of their background, very democratic. And that -- say, about the whole
background in the school, and then, from [indecipherable] I started with two or three
papers, and later on, we made them ourselves. And we, that is my mates 1-in Snagerstein,

playmates, were people who, we had grown up together, same age, 16 - 17 years old,
when we -- we got the -- it’s a possibility to make our own paper.
Q: So at first -- I want to just go through this, a friend came with some papers and you
asked for a few, and then you took them and distributed them, 1s that it?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: We gave them to people we knew would be interested in them. And then, later on, it’s
most -- quite natural that we made this 50 - 60 copy a month and brought them to people,
and sometimes, if something special happened, we had one page, which they -- we
brought out for -- I remember one of the main thing was when Stalingrad fell, 1t was a
very, very hot number. And also, when there happened something in Denmark, the first
murder. B-Because everything escalated. And --
Q: The first murder?
A: That was -- That was -- We called it a cleary murder. Where the Germans shot a Dane
who have done nothing. Just killed him on -- If, for instance, w -- the -- the -- an
informant for -- a Nazi informant was a danger for the resistance movement, he, after the
case was seen really through, that there will be no mistake, then he was liquidated. And
then, always, when one of this hi -- Nazi servants, they were shot, that was cleary murder.
And then, that was completely innocent people. And normally, was more than one, this
would be doubled up, or something like that. And also, when there was a big sabotage.
And sabotage was -- I never was involved in that, but sabotage was also a reasonable

selfish thing that we did. Because when we -- not we, but when the saboteurs got the
order from England, this factory is dangerous because they are making that. It is much
better that we, in Denmarks, had people who set the -- the -- the bomb inside and blew it
up. You see what happen when you have air attacks? We saved quite a lot of civil lives
by sabotage, and it’s much more precise. And the people who was working in the
factories who were blown up, they were warned, and they came out. That means it was a
human, much better way to be self-destructive, than to have the British and American
aircrafts coming over and bombing. So, therefore, 1 -- sabotage was a very serious attack
on the German war machine, and that was, therefore, that the Germans, in ’43, the 29" of
August, where there have been quite a lot of sabotage before, that was railway, it means
that the transportation between Germany and Norway, which normally went through the
Danish headlines, they were disturbed, and then the -- the Germans demanded that there
should be again, a general punishment for sabotage and for carrying weapon. Then the
Danish government said no, we can’t do that. And the Danish government
[indecipherable] Danish government resigned, but there was not appointed a ne -- new
government, and the -- it m -- had the effect that the Danish administration continued, but
the leader was not a political secretary, but the man who was chief of the office. And not
elected, it was an administration, and that administration continued until the day of
liberation, the fifth of May, 1945.

Q: A few more details about the period when you’re distributing papers. When this young
man who initially gave you the paper, did -- I mean, did you have to be interviewed, or
checked out in some way to become a part of this network?
A: Only people they knew got it. It was not necessary, and af -- and whe-where I live, the
school -- okay [indecipherable] schoolmate and the people I had contact with in my home
Willet, I knew very well. So, it was not necessary to -- to have this check out. We -- We
knew it was people who stand for.
Q: And yet, there could have been people who were collaborating secretly. Was there that
fear at all? Did you have any misgivings, and how were you careful?
A: We knew who were Nazi in our little town. That was no prob -- we had one or two
who had these crazy ideas, a -- but they were not member of society any more. They were
ap -- only to they -- a -- a kind of outcast, we -- because their mentality was that long
from ours. So, no, that was no -- there was n-no danger there. Peoples who came out of --
from somewheres, it could be difficult, but then -- then we could make an re -- in-inquiry
somewhere, but it was never necessary, but we had people enough, the young people in
Snagerstein was almost hundred percent involved.
Q: Ho-How many young people were involved, would you say?
A: I think we were n -- 15 in the little village.
Q: Okay. Now, is this something that your grandmother knew you were doing?
A: No.
Q: Why not?

A: Oh, well, later on she says she wo-would have been very, very sorry if we didn’t had.
But I think that was her fear for the consequences, and well, I don’t know, I think that
most fathers and mothers, or grandmothers, don’t want to let something be a risk for their
children. I -- What we did was okay, that was right, but why just you? I think -- I think
that was that. But she would, without doubt, have denied me to do it, I suppose, I
suppose.
Q: S-So you did have to be secretive. I mean, how did you -- tell me a little bit about that.
How were you careful? Ho -- Where did you carry the papers? If you were dropping it off

sense of how you did that.
A: Just like a normal delivery boy deliver things. You go to the door, knock at the door,
give it to the right person. That’s all [indecipherable]. Only once I was -- another man
saw it, and that was a policeman who stopped me. But he was a policeman, and he’d
come t -- later on, it meant something, because he stopped me b -- th -- I don’t know
whether it’s the I-lights on my bike that was not okay, but he saw what I had in my
briefcase, and uh-huh, good. Because that is the most important thing, that the Danish
police, most of all, really was loyal to the Danes, not to the Germans. I must admit that in
Copenhagen, there was a -- a group of police -- of people who was really Nazi infiltrated.

something I brought from the school.
Q: Tell me -- What -- Did -- Did the newspaper that you had brought from the school, did
it have a name?
A: That was Studentinus Iftatin, the Student’s News.
Q: Okay. And when they actually got news, were they -- how did they get news and then
put it in the newspaper?
A: Well, they had from BBC, and the national news, the -- okay, you know, that
everything goes faster than -- than the lightning. So they -- First of all, what ha -- the
criticism of the government, and we had very good writers. Later on, we saw -- saw one

Q: Gi -- You said that somebody be -- was a -- a -- a very good writer, and became a well
known journalist. What -- Who is the name of that person?
A: Outsede, O-u-t-sed-e. He was famous. And many of the -- the -- the authors ra -- made
articles in the -- in this illegal papers under nom de guerre. And that was -- the only way
to -- to have your talk -- the normal papers had censorship. That was very difficult to -- to
write anything against Hitler, against Germany. That was not allowed. And in the -- in the
radio, the same thing. There was a -- a censorship there. There was a man with a finger
on the button, that if something not special good for [indecipherable] you cut off. So that
was -- And the papers had to follow the instruction, otherwise we would ge-get no paper.
So it was rather - a little bit necessary, with the illegal papers, and all that. A little part of
the -- of the truth. But the ne-newsreels, they were just about all the German riksers, all
what they could do. But also they’re -- Never forget, we came through it because of
humor, too. Humor was -- was reasonable. In that time it was so that the cinema played
twice a day, seven and nine in the evening. And always there was this German newsreel,
and the -- one day there was, on the first performance, seven o’clock, the newsreel said,
“And we had an attack on England, and we shot 110 enemy aircrafts down. One of our
own are missing.” There was a man sit -- from the halls who said, “Don’t worry, guys,
it'll be back at the nine performance.” But, humor, I really think we -- humor has also
something to do with surviving, and might be there, Jews and Danes are -- have a little bit
in common. We don’t like, for instance, a Jew -- Jewi -- stories about Jews. Well, we
don’t tell them ourself. We have -- There was also, in 43, Fieldmarshall Goering visited

Denmark, and he wanted to see a Viking ship. And then he went out where there was an
old Viking ship, the [indecipherable] and when Marshall Goering came and saw it, he --
and he said, “Hm, 1s that all?” And the little man who was in care of the -- that museum
said, “Yes, that is all, Fieldmarshall. But with this ships, we conquered England.” See, th
-- such story, told in a depressed situation, give a little light, a little smile, and 1s also why
you survive, reasons of survival, that, oh well, it bad, but it c-could be better, it would be
better.
Q: Now, at this point, you’re very involved in these newspapers. H-H-How are you
thinking? How do you -- What are you thinking about what you’re doing? Do you think
to yourself, I’m a member of this informal resistance? How do you make -- yeah, make
sense of what you’re doing?
A: Yes, but what else could we do? You see, that’s so strange that you all will -- shall
have a reason. That is the only right to do. It has nothing to d -- with deep phil-
philosophy, it was a must. Somebody had to do these things. And well, why shouldn’t it
be me? All my -- my nearest friends do the same thing. We’re together in it, and okay,
it’s also funny to cheat the Germans a little bit. I cannot -- I cannot go from that s-side of
the story to that. It was irritating for the Germans to know that all their lies is not at all
believed. And therefore, I always take what is coming from every general, in east or west,
was some -- a little bit of okay, maybe, maybe. I hope it’s right, but --

It means that should at least been 18. So --

But no, I was never -- not any possibility. And that was also mostly a big town --

people received weapon from -- from air. The w-weapon which was sent down from
American and British aircraft. Well, that was guns, that was ammunition, that was
detonators and all these explosives. And that was mostly fr-from people from the
countryside. They kn-knew -- knew the area, they was much better in position to hide this
-- the different materials they got down. And -- But I’m -- I was never involved in that,
too. And the reason why I was involved in -- in the October actions, was because of that
policeman, wh-who -- he came one day and s -- that was beginning [indecipherable] and
said go and pick some people out from the station and bring them, and he s -- gave me
some addresses. And --
Q: Who was that policeman?

A: Mr. Chumla Larsen. The guy here, and he had the -- the big influence, because he was
a police officer and had wi -- he was in the foreign police, and he had the connection with
the Swedish Mr. Palmroot, you will see too him, in the book, because they worked
together from the -- one from Danish and one -- one from Swedish side. And therefore,
he was able to have more news, more informations. And he came and he was the founder
of the group called Elsinore Sookgloop. Elsinore Sewing Club, it means nothing, but the
child should have a name, and that was the name. And they were the owner of the book --
of the boat you see on this museum -- in the Holocaust museum. The fish -- the -- the 21
feet motorboat.
Q: Who was [indecipherable]
A: This si -- The Elsinore Sewing Club.
Q: Okay.
A: And that was used there in October, for transporting quite a lot of people. In October,
Jews most, but later on, 1t was used as career boat, as gun running with -- from Sweden
with weapons for the Danish resistant movement. And Danish resistant movement people
had to go to Sweden, it was also -- some allied soldiers shot down over Denmark, who
had the luck to go to the coast on Canova, and they -- they were -- we had more boats, but
this boat was the only -- was -- still was there when the museum required it.

and I wonder if you could tell us the teacher’s name, and -- and more -- a little bit more
about him. He -- He became a -- an important person in the whole situation.
A: Froida Yacobsen was the name. He was a social democrat. He was very, very soon 1n
the action against the Nazis. He was a career between the Danish social democrat party,
and the -- the German social democrats. He was in Germany very often, on bicycle and
[inaudible] he was in the organization Matcha Otchie. And they helped many Germans
when the party was forbidden by Hitler. And he was so anti-Nazi, and anti-Fascism. And
of course, he was not a -- a real teacher, he was, what do you call it?

Beginning Tape Two, Side A

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Preben Munch Nielsen. This is tape number two, side A. Okay, you were telling us about
Froida Yacobsen.
A: Oh yeah. He was one of the men who started the Danish resistant movement, and
when there was Council of Freedom, he was one of the first mem-members, and he made
a tremendous job for the rest of the war, and had, together with people like
[indecipherable] he wa-was later the -- the head of the Copenhagen University, a doctor,
and many other people, they really administrated the resistant movement’s actions. There
was no power for them, it was just done. In ’44, some of them were arrested, but they --
some of them wa-was freed again because of a -- a bombardment of the jail where they
were. And that was -- Again that -- It’s very difficult when s -- things comes by an air
attack, because one of the bombs fell in a school, that French school in Copenhagen,
where 150 kids were killed. It was -- Therefore, we were thankful for what the saboteurs
did.
Q: Who was bombing?
A: That was the British. And the -- It was a mistake on the -- but, we see the -- the risk
when -- when you have the -- the bombardments.
Q: If you could just help me understand a little bit. Did you understand that he was such
an important figure when he was in your school as an apprentice, or was it later that you

understood what he had done, or -- and -- and -- and, if so, what -- what were you aware
of him? I mean, what was he like?
A: He was a little man. He was very strong in gestures, and talking very loud, and he did
not make silence about his hates to ger -- to -- not Germans, he loved Germany, but he
hated the Nazis. He was a Socialist, and our school was very conservative, but he was a
premed -- very fine teacher, and his idea about freedom was not to overlook. And first --
later, I understood -- I was not -- I -- I agree completely, because he was that kind of man
who could do something -- aga-again these people were [indecipherable] or were -- were
heart and people -- maybe a little bit of a demagogue, but well, he needed to be that on
that time. It was a strange time, and later I met him many, many times. We had one
meeting a year, that was the opening of a artist -- a gallery, where s -- thus -- a union of --
of -- not union, a company of artists, they show what they have done for the last year, and
he was from Impa just like we, my wife and me, and we met there every year. And --
Until last year, he died a little -- year ago. He was 89, or something like. He was a
marvelous pers-personality, and he really made us forget a little bit of the shame we had.
We also had another teacher, he was the first man who really, in Denmark, wrote a --
against Fascist man, and the nasic idea. He wrote a book, “Plague over Europe,” where
he defined what Fascism was. He was later on Secretary of Education in a social
democrat government. So -- But he -- he had it -- he was more on the philosophic part of
a ger, where he really f -- make us even more to dislike the Nazi philosophy.

Q: What would you say your teacher -- apprentice teacher, Froida Yacobsen, what --
what did you take away from him? What did you do, do you think you learned? You
know, you -- you mentioned that you felt less shame, you were very proud of him, but di
-- did you take away any other things from him?
A: Yes, but his idea that you have to stand up when thing is not right. You cannot just, as
a good Christian, turn the left chin, when you are beaten on the right. You have to -- and
under these circumstances, during the war, during occupation, you had to stand up and
show that you -- [indecipherable] things, that we’ll not -- we’ll be bound of -- and
especially because the ideas they wanted us to believe in was all against our ideas, against
our belief. It was opposites all what we have learned to love and -- and believe in. So, he
gave us this -- the maturation, what to do. If you want to be a full man, you will have to
do something maybe you don’t dare to do. But you do it. That’s the only way we -- we
can survive. It was, in 1941, ’42, 43, up to °45, a matter of survival. It wa-was about the
future of our country. If Hitler had won the war, okay we as Danes, maybe would be -- ha
-- been the next ins -- command after the wonderful SS. To me it’s -- the greatest fun 1s to
see these wonderful Aryans, Hitler and Goebbels, in the -- in the front. But that should be
the types and samples of the Aryan future [indecipherable]. I don’t buy it.
Q: At this point, what did -- At this point, what is going on with the king of your country?
D-Do you ever see him, and what do you think about how he’s conducting himself?
A: The king of Denmark was, as typical Danish kings, not true intelligent. But he was a
very stubborn man, and he was stubborn at the right time. He was an -- no would ever

deny that, the gallant pawn for Denmark. He made a fantastish way out of delod. He -- in
the start, when he rode through Copenhagen every day, and the Germans soldiers, they
saluted him, he looked to the other side. And he -- Once, a German ask people, “How c-
come that your king 1s riding here? Where’s his guards?” And the underlings answered,
“We are the g-guard.” He could do that, he was respected. He -- He did 1t wonderful his -
- he stood up. I know that’s a story about him that -- that he would wear the yellow star, if
-- if -- but that’s not true. There was never a yellow star in Denmark, but the story is
good, and if the situation had been so, he would have done it, no doubt, no doubt. But the
-- that’s one of the stories who are not true, but in a way, bear a bit of truth in -- in the
self , because he would have done it, no doubt. He never talked about Jews or Italians, he
talked about Danes. My citizens are Danes, and -- and that’s all. He was the first king
ever to visit a synagogue. And that was before the war, but you see, 1-1t’s -- that’s a game
that, it’s to show that the Jews were a part of the Danish society.
Q: He used to ride his horse -- when you’re talking about riding, he was riding his horse.
Did you ever see him?
A: Yes, many times.
Q: Describe it.
A: Yes, but you see, he came from the castle, through one of the streets there, and ladies,
they went out and [indecipherable] out, you know, turn, turn. That was Denmark coming,
and nothing else, and he did it in a marvelous, good way. But then, one day he s -- fell off
the horse, there was something happening, and that was the last time. And then, from

August -- August 29", he had to give up his guard, and police troops came in, Danish, in
order to -- to protect him, but from that ti -- we didn’t see him. And that was again that he
was -- yeah, his leg was hurt, I don’t know whether it -- 1t was amputated, I -- I just know
that he couldn’t -- couldn’t walk and -- but he was a marvelous king, from ’40 to 45 --
47, he died, in °47. And he was very beloved, and he was married to a German princess
who se -- from the ninth of April, never would receive any relatives on the castle -- of the
German relatives. That was -- But our -- We have very good fa -- good royal family. Oh
well, we have had it since year 900. King Gom the Old, so we have grown accustomed to
their ways.
Q: His -- His name was King Christian?
A: The 10".
Q: The 10"?
A: Yes.
Q: I-I -- I want to see if you recall, when you first began getting some inkling that things
were shifting in the country, specifically with -- that -- that Jews might be rounded up by
the -- the Nazis? Do you remember how you heard about it or who told you?
A: That policeman who came and said to me, I have heard rumors about -- that somebody
has been arrested, and -- but at that time, it often happened that Germany stopped some
people and -- and then they were arrested and sent to -- to Germany. But now it was a
whole group. The Jews, the -- and well, I was first aware of it the day when I was not
asked, but told to go pick these people up, and bring them there. And --

Q: And you -- where were you? Were you at home at that time?
A: I was -- I was at home, a night, making my loy for next day’s school, and then he
came and said, do that and that, and I did, and that was a start.
Q: Do you remember approximately when that was?
A: It was in -- in be -- the beginning of October, second, third of October, and it was
strange to see these people come there, with their trunks and completely out of their --
know, they were, in a way, rather quiet, but you -- you could see they were afraid, and --
that was -- that was really the first day I really fully understood what we were fighting
for. What the -- What’s it all about. And well -- But then, when they came to the different
houses, with people I knew, of course. Okay, come in, see so and so, and so on. No
Christian asked them -- later on, when I ask why we should do that. Because we knew
everybody, we knew where there was a dog, we knew how -- yes, because who maybe
would bark. We knew exactly how to find every path in the wood. We knew also, how
you can go from one garden to another, without going on the street. So, that was -- that
was the first assignment we got, and w-we were, let’s see now, fif -- well, 10, anyhow,
who did that first. And then, the day after, I remember we should go there and there. We
had 11 places from where there was -- people was -- boats was sailing from, and we went
down with it, with the people on it. Everything was -- the only thing, one of our doctor,
Doctor Gasfeld, he had sometimes to give an injection to children, in order to keep them
quiet, and that was --

A: And that was, he said, [indecipherable] thing that he ever have done, because it was
not his patient, he didn’t know the condition and yes -- but he did it, and -- and never
forget that, there was no losses. All the passenger we had, came out. And that, luck -- we
had the church letters, we had the hospitals. When the day came, you know that 1-it was
leaked by a German, the s -- the Jewish society would not believe it. And --
Q: You’re talking about at the higher level, that a -- a German told a Dane that -- that --
that Nazis were going to round up all the Jews in early October.
A: That was Mr. Dukfitz, he was a member of the German litigation. He was a Merchant
Marine diplomat, and he had -- was told there would be two boats coming in to pick up
the Jews. Maybe he was okay, infilled by the Danish civilization, so he told it to -- to two
Danish politicians and they went to the Jewish societies, to the mosiac society to the
synagogue, they wouldn’t believe it. But when they related this news to the fact there had
been burglaries in the different organization, and the only thing missing was --
Q: Burglaries, in the --
A: Burglaries, yeah. And -- And the only thing missing was the register of members of
the synagogue, they saw it. And then we have the story about Rabbi Milcher going in and

there -- 1t was not possible to -- to evacuate the Jewish old age home, because it was just
behind the synagogue, and the synagogue was always guarded by -- by Gestapo. So they
couldn’t bring these people out, and it meant that when they came, that morning, and on
that night, quite a lot of the people from -- from the old age home, were taken and
brought to -- to Germany.
Q: I want to ask a few more details about what you’re assignment was. So, you were at
home, and this policeman that we’ve mentioned, comes and tell -- gives you an
assignment. Where were you supposed to pick up the group of people? What -- How did
you pick them up, in a car or walking? And did you do it right away? Was this something
you went and did right away, or how did it work?
A: [indecipherable] within one hour, they should come, and I went to the station, and they
came there, and --
Q: The train station?
A: The train station, yes, and I, of course asked, “How shall I know them?” “You will
know them,” he said. And they came there, and okay, you know, very confused. They
have got the message that -- and then the -- the only guy -- man they saw was a guy 17
years old, come along. And we went to these families and stayed there, because I -- I was
also -- I would get new orders later. And brought them to the -- to the people there and
from other stations, Elsinore, Esbeger, Snagerstein, people came, they have got ex --
explanations, you go there and there. And then the Mr. Chumsen, who [indecipherable]

different groups, because many -- there was a private fisher, we belonged to the resistant
movement, and so, out of nothing, came a fleet. Really, there were quite a lot of boats
going o -- further up at the coast, the big fisher boats, they could take 50 at every trip
over, and that was -- but our boat had been there before, because that -- that
[indecipherable] used to -- since the 29" of August, where we shipped soldiers, Danish
officers, because that’s -- they started -- Danish military battalion -- no, that’s regiment, I
joined that, later on, after coming to Sweden. So, it was -- the -- we had our boat, and that
boat was in use all the time, and then a couple times, I was asked to go with a -- if there
was something very important, and later on, I too -- because I was a culear, I had letters
from -- I don’t know who, but I knew who was the receiver in -- in Sweden. But, 1-1n the
first time, 1t was so, that the people came up, and they have been hidden, the -- the Jewish
refugees come up, they have been hidden, for instant, in the hospital, becau --
Q: This was the first time you were asked to do it?
A: No, the first time, no, no. But people came from hospitals, they came from ev --
anywhere. In hospital, there are always places or rooms where they connect the different -
- different parts of the hospital. That was warm, there were -- and they had plenty of food,
and they stayed there for a couple of days, three, four days, and then, for instance, if there
was a funeral from the hospital, first was the wagon with the body -- and there was lots of
taxis, and they go from the hospital to the cemetery, but a car, one on one, make another
direction, and that way, they came out of the hospital, without being -- it was natural
there was many cars.

Q: Not you, but the resistance movement?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: And that gave the possibility to get up to the coast, and that is one of the ways. Other
ways was by ambulances, they were going up there. But, the most came by -- by train.

We were -- We had more freedom, in a way, if you can call that freedom, that you can
drive a -- a train without a special passport. But we could do that, and -- and people came
by themself, and every time -- Goldberger -- Professor Goldberger, he ha -- has been very
involved in this -- this museum, he told that his father was cantor in the -- at the
synagogue, had taken out his beard, that is --
Q: Shaved his beard.
A: Yeah, shaved his beard -- beard, and that is, for him, very, very, very important, but
when he was sitting 1n a train, he had tried to find a way to get out, and was in the train
back to -- to Copenhagen, then the -- [indecipherable] came and they said, “Oh, hello
Cantor Ricoff.” So, but that was -- at the trains, there were no special guard. And by the
way, I don’t think that the most of these crazy SS men, Gestapo, knew what a Jew looked
like. One thing they wouldn’t understand, that anybody would help a Jew. That was a

very big surprise, they thought, it’s very easy, let them hide, w-when -- in no time they
will come up and we take them as sitting ducks. But they didn’t come, and it gave us,
really, at least one week where they just hesitated, and -- and that -- that was a mood in
the people, they re -- that was the first time we -- a li -- forgot a little bit of the shame and
-- and really thought, okay. That -- That was the result of it.
Q: You were sitting up straighter --
A: I’m a little bit proud --
Q: -- just now, when you did that.
A: -- a little bit proud of it. And -- But, on the other side, we had all the luck. In 1943 --
no, in 1942, the Norwegian Jews was taken. Sweden did not help, would not help. But in
1943, after we had el Alemaigne, where Rommel was thrown out of Africa, we had
Stalingrad. Rome had surrendered and the master of the sky was the allied aircrafts.
There will be no, no risk for Sweden for a German attack. Germany, or ra -- ja -- Sweden
accepted to take all Danish refugees in. Remember one thing, all Danish refugees. I -- Is
very important, because we had some not Danish Jews, who’d been in Denmark, coming
up from Poland. Not many, but they were ha -- ha -- was in the country the ninth of April,
when we were occupied and pa -- they stayed there. But that was the cr -- we’ll always
see that in the -- in the book --

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Preben Munch Nielsen. This is tape number two, side B.
A: And -- Where did we come to?
Q: You -- You were just talking, I think, about the circumstances which had changed,
which perhaps made this possible.
A: Yeah, because what happening was that now w -- the Swedes gave all Danes free pass
to Sweden. But we’d had these Jewish -- non-Danish Jews, but together with quite a lot
of refugees, came also Danish police people. You must remember that in 1943, and
before the war, it was very seldom a Dane had a passport. We could go without passports
as -- into Sweden, Norway and Finland, and that was normally what was done, that was
before the charter explosion and -- and people did not -- I remember when my uncle, wh-
who lived in Paris in the 30’s, came back to Denmark by air, it was in the local papers,
that -- th-that -- so 1t wa -- so seldom was it. But the Danish police, they issue a passport
to most all the refugees, and when a girl, Jewish, from Poland, non-Danish resident, she
got a Danish passport. That way, she was under the promise from si -- from Sweden, that
all Danes were able to come in, and she tells it -- about it in -- in my book. So -- But,
again, the whole situation in Ochabol was very uncertain, a -- but also, there was
something, I don’t know, who saved -- there was -- as a Christian, I can say a guardian
angel. We had the time, we had the warning, we had the church, and out of nowhere,
there was a fleet of boats, and that is, to me a sign of something, I don’t know, but the
meaning was that there should be no Holocaust in there.

Q: I wonder if you could tell -- tell me a few more details. I want to fi-finish the story that
you -- you were told by the policeman, one evening without warning. You went to the
train station, you recognized the group of people, the group of Jews coming. What did --
Tell me where you took them. And presumably, you hadn’t had a chance to call your
neighbors and say you were coming by, so tell me how that worked.
A: They have already been in contact with the policemen, and that was no -- that was
later on, when more came -- more refugees came than expected, that we just went to the
next door, and it was never denied. Come in and let’s -- We never took more than three in
-- we have seen in at -- a little town, north of Elsinore, Gilleleje, where 80 people was
taken on the church loft, and that was because of a girl who was dating a German soldier,
talked, because of ignorance. And then Gestapo came and took these 80 people. And that
was the most that were taken, and just like the -- together with the people from the old
age home, the greatest number. So far, I remember about 600 were sent to Germany, and
60 died. None of them came -- of the [indecipherable] came to Auschwitz. And I really
think that -- that’s also very important, that we had no government, but we had that
administration. And then, they got to go to Red Cross -- Danish Red Cross, the possibility
to visit Auschwit -- no, Theresienstadt. They knew it will be used -- misused in
propaganda. The Danish part of Theresienstadt was painted, they got dressed up with
plants outside, but of course, the prisoner was not allowed to speak alone with -- with the
delegation coming down from Denmark, but they should speak together with a German
officer, and the only language, of course, German, was allowed. But this delegation had

two very important -- very important results. The first, that 1t was allowed to send gift
parcels to the prisoners. That was some va -- why someone send clothes, some food, not
much, but just that was give the different for starving to death and just starve. They sent
school books to the children, so they could have some formal education down there. The
next, and the most important then, was that none of the Danish prisoner should be sent to
Auschwitz, or the other extermination camps. And the German kept it. And just before
the war was over, I think it was March or April, ’45, the white buses came and took --
that was the Danish resistant movement, who demanded that it was not only the Danish
resistant movement people who should be brought back from Buchenwald, or what -- the
other name, but also the Jews in Theresienstadt, so they came home before the war, not to
Denmark, they had -- they was not allowed to be there, to Sweden. And from Sweden
they returned, in ’45, in July, I suppose. A-A-A month or two after the war, and they
come back to their homes, and --
Q: Th-Th-This week that all of the activity’s going on and -- and you’re very busy, did
you stop going to school that week, and tell -- and were you working pretty much all the
time? H-H-How many people did you pick up, would you estimate, in -- or maybe how
many trips did you make?
A: I -- I -- I can’t recall. I -- That was a 24 hours job. Of course, picking up from the
station, that was only until 11 - 12 o’clock. There were no trains pa -- in the night, but to
bring them round, to -- and then maybe sup -- go down to the beach and wi -- cause now,
there’Il be -- there’ll be a transport possibility. That was -- And that’s the first time my

grandma smelled there was something. But at that time, one of my cu -- my oldest cousin,
he went to America already, in ’39, and he was in the American Air Force. And my -- He
was also [indecipherable] my cousin. He flew -- He was refugee in, oh that was in 43, in
beginning of 43. And then, in end of ’43, I had to go to Sweden, because of the --
something happened in Denmark, some were arrested, and then I had to stay. But, that
was, of course, pretty much the job, and -- but the worse thing was, when s -- when the
refugees had tried to hide themselves in the wood. And then we were young people, who
knew every path. We knew exactly where would you hide if you -- and -- and -- but it
took longer time to get them. And th-they were afraid un -- beca -- in that
[indecipherable] in that way that we were speaking Danish to each other. So -- And the
refugees could not understand what we would, that no German soldier dared to go into
wood. They walked together two or three, but through a wood? No, no, no, no. It was too
dangerous, no lights, no nothing. No. When they have seen, often before, that was the
way the Danish resistant movement had some of their weapons, by knocking two soldiers
down and taking their rifles. So -- But, in a way it was -- when a -- I look back, it was
without any excitement. That was -- I understand the refugees, how it must be awful,
awtul, awful. But I -- All the things we have, and now the view of life and death in --
during a war. We accustomed to death. When you hear about Stalingrad, 400,000 killed,
the millions, they [indecipherable] after the war, we really understood that six million
Jews, so and so many Gypsies, and 10 million Russians was killed by Stalin, and -- but
that was, in a way -- let me say I -- I thought we did a good job. I was satisfied that we

have done it, and when we waved goodbye to -- 1-in a way, have we fulfilled what
Eichmann would have? To remove the Jews from the Danish bot? Isn’t that completely
ironic? That, in a way, Hitler had a result. But, there was one thing that 1s more
important. They came back, and they were welcome back.
Q: In your years, did you ever come across someone who recognized you and said, “You
took me over on a boat.”
A: The only [indecipherable] is my wife’s maid. They graduate together, no. We --
Q: Tell that story, tell that story.
A: Yes, that’s -- We were here in New York some years ago, and -- here at the museum,
and then we were asked if we knew any Danish Jews living in America, and Sonia had
the girlfriend, th -- they graduate together, and she came -- ask her to gi -- if they had
some material, artifacts, to the museum, and they did. And then we came in and talked
about it and she have been over in our boat, in the boat. So, at the meeting here, after the
museum was opened, about Denmark and the rescue, she could tell about the boat up
here. She came over, and I could tell how it was to have that boat, and -- but that was
only a-an -- she was, of course, a little girl at that time, and -- 10 years old, maybe -- may
-- no younger, eight years. And I-I-I can’t recall all that, and she couldn’t, of course not.
But, 1t was a job who was done secretly. You did notice [indecipherable]. The less
people knew, the better. And quite a lot of the thing was in darkness. Remember, it was
ju -- we have black -- what you call black-out, we -- 1t was not allowed to show lights
from the houses, and when we went from the houses, down to the beach, it was through

these passes. We knew, so we can go on scene from there, where they have stayed, the
shelter, and down to -- to the beach. So -- And the most of the people were thinking of
anything else. Why, that was the last part, which they thought was the most dangerous
part. What I think was, I couldn’t ag-agree that wa -- w-we never discuss it, but unsure --
we were never hundred percent sure, out there, we could see the enemy. So -- But -- But
most of -- of the people never m-met again. It was -- You must recall that from Denmark
to Sweden came totally, over 20,000 refugees, from resistant movement, the searchers
from Germa -- German army. Only one-third of all the -- the refugees w-was Jewish. Yes.
Q: Essentially, at some moment, you were a refugee, correct?
A: Yes, it happened so that later this year, when the refugees -- not more were Jewish, I
continued to -- to work in this way, that I was a career. I got from -- still from my school
Q: A courier.
A: Yeah, courier. I -- From -- Came, got some letters to deliver in Sweden, because we
have the route, I was in charge to do that, and one day, I was told when they come over
from our liaison officer, Mr. Pallum, the -- the Ger -- Swedish policeman, that I couldn’t
go back because something had -- some had been arrested and -- and well, I was 17 years
old, so I maybe thought that it was too dangerous, so I went to school in Sweden,
graduated. I have a Swedish family.
Q: Where did you live?

A: In Lindsherding. That’s in wi -- it’s, oh well, if -- 300 kilometers north of -- of the --
where we -- we have our -- at Helsinbor, th -- 300 kilometers. And I graduated and from
there I went directly into the Danish brigade, and was a soldier.
Q: Tell us a little bit about the Danish brigade. You’ve mentioned that, but I wasn’t as --
sure what that was, because -- are you saying it existed in Sweden?
A: It was so that after the 29" of August, in ’43, the Danish gen -- staff -- general staff,
sent some Danish officer to Sweden, 1n order to, if it was possible, to make a regiment
over there, because most part of the refugees was from resistant movement, and they
wanted to do something, and there were military force built up with the Sweden’s
acknowledgement, and paid by the Danes, of course, and under command of General
Jewingeres, and British general, we were s-str [indecipherable] to serve to the six army.
No, the eight army, under ja -- Montgomery. And we were supposed to be -- to land in
Denmark, if there was -- and when -- an invasion on the Danish.
Q: So you were training to be a real ground troop?
A: [indecipherable]. Yes, we ha -- we had really commander training, it was very hard,
but still we have that -- we had a purpose. We had really that idea to come back and fight.
To have the sin from the ninth of April away. But -- And in that, of course, there were
many Jews. Young Jews.
Q: [indecipherable]

A: Yes, of course. They were Danish citizens. So that was the same -- you si -- you see,
that’s also maybe the difference. No -- No, that’s not difference, because quite a lot of
Jews were really wonderful German soldiers in the first World War.
Q: And the Polish.
A: The Polish, too, yes. So, their loss. So we -- I started there, just after I graduated, and
was -- I think it was end of March from ’44, and we returned back in the fifth of May,
1945.
Q: Were you hoping that you would be able to go while the war was still on?
A: Hope to do what?
Q: To fight.
A: Well, that was the purpose. Later on, that was strange enough, because we only had
very small fights with the Germans, and I suppose we lost 10 or 15 men, or something
like that. But we were a little bit disappointed. We -- It wa -- Again, luck. I -- I -- I don’t
know how we shall d-describe, not only the Jews situation, but oth -- the other Danish
situation. That was something that kept em from the disaster. When you came back to
Denmark, it has not towns ruined by bombs. We -- We had the possibility to -- to live, we
-- SO it -- 1-1t was something very strange. Not a rich country, but not a poor country, not a
destroyed country. And it’s a country which not had an internal fight between left and
right. And we were so lucky that the Russian invasion stopped before our border. Only
one place, on one of the isles, Bornholm, 1t was bombed, because a German commandant

would not surrender, then they were bombed by Russians. And the Russian took
Bornholm, and stayed there for so and so long time.
Q: Describe how you got back to Denmark. When were you told that you should
mobilize? How did you get over with your brigade? And -- And perhaps even when you
actually got off the boat, how did your -- your fellow citizens react?
A: Well, we were mobilized long time, because from [indecipherable] after the Odenna
offensive of -- in -- of pard -- Christmas, ’44, we were in red ale-alert, always should be
no distance from -- from our weapons. Then we were brought down, transported to our
camp in south of Sweden. And then, in the night and I can tell you that Denmark was an
ixtas, the fourth of May, that 1t was said on BBC. The German troops in Holland,
northwest Germany and Denmark, has surrendered. And we stood there, of course,
happy. But then, during the night, we went to Helsinbor, went into -- to a fisher boat com
-- [indecipherable] over, a small -- Maritimcota from the fleet, and later on, the ferries
was used, and we came into Elsin-Elsinore and families standing there, and crying. It was
wonderful.
Q: Did you know anyone in the crowd?
A: Oh, that was my hometown, yes. After 10 minutes, I was in my own hou -- home, just
for five minutes, to say hello.
Q: What did your grandmother say to you?
A: Welcome home. Oh, wa -- It was -- It was a day.

Q: And then, you said you just had five minutes. Wha-What was your assignment, where
did you have to go off to?
A: Oh well, we should -- we had two assignments. First of all, our -- we were an infantry
battalion, we went down to the boat line between Germany and Denmark. We have to see
that the Germans came out of Denmark in order, and not stealing too much. And we did
that for -- until July month. We had another -- We have some pioneers -- engineer
soldiers, and they should be in command of getting the mine fields clean. And that was,
of course, the German soldiers who -- who did the Dutch job, but our men was so

Q: You kept the German soldiers so that they could help you sweep for the mines?
A: Yeah. I know that 1s not quite doing the Geneva co-committee, but well, they have put
it down, let them take it up. So -- But w-we -- That was a really smooth affair down in --
in -- in -- in their borderline. There was only few accidents. Some German soldiers tried -
- that was SS soldiers, tried to go behind the lines, because they knew that they will be in
special camps, and we caught some of them, but the most they -- old men, to me. They
came there, going with their baskets and there no future, they couldn’t see anything. That
was not the -- the very strong army we have seen Hitler, that -- what he did to his own,
that is remarkable. But they followed him.

Beginning Tape Three, Side A
Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Preben Munch Nielsen. This is tape number three, side A. Before we move on too much
into the post war era, I wanted to ask this question, and you’ve certainly touched on it
many times, but why do you think the rescue of Jews, fellow citizens, but they were Jews,
was so successful in -- in your country? Why do you think that was so?
A: It was obviously the only way we can do it, the only way we could live. That’s, as I
said before, 20,000 refugees, Danish refugees was in -- in Sweden, one-third was Jewish.
Whether you’re -- Whether Dane, Jewish or non-Jewish, thas would be the same. We had
to do everything we could to save Danes from the fate, to go to a concentration camp. We
knew about the concentration camps in 1943, not the -- the whole truth, but we knew that
these people will live in agony, I -- we nee -- they had to live in humiliation, they were
starve -- you couldn’t do that. And especially not the Jews, because they were absolutely
innocent. There was very few Jews in the Danish resistant movement, because that was
an agreement, that we wouldn’t have -- we wouldn’t know, the people who decide that --
that because of a Jew was caught, we should see a Crystal night in Denmark. We couldn’t
have that. One of my good friends, [indecipherable] Israel, he lives in Israel now, he was
one of the guys who took -- broke in -- in the synagogue, and took all the silver. The
Torah scrolls, they were all hidden in a Danish church, remember that, all hidden there.
But -- There was quite a lot, and they were afraid. And he was one of the few members of
the -- the resistant movement, and together with other Danes, he took the silver, send it to

the commanding chief of the German troops in -- up in Narveek. It came, because then
would it go to Elsinore. And in Elsinore, it was taken by the resistant movement, and --
and -- and -- and hidden ti -- until the war. The synagogue was not touch by the Germans.
This -- The Jewish prisoners interationta was not sent to Auschwitz. Why”? Because SS,
Gestapo, the Germans, have seen how we reacted. And we were -- Denmark were rather
important as distributor of food to Germany. And it mean, if they did something, it will
be closed. The Danish railway sabotage was qua -- rather good. At the same time, they
were building up the west la -- la -- the lansing line, or what, west wall what do you call
it? And it was so much sabotaged in Denmark, by putting sugar in the concrete, and it
wouldn’t harden. You know that? And they have seen -- they have seen the result that --
but they never would have believed, helps the Jews. They must have been completely out
of their mind.
Q: Do you ever think, or have you thought, or discussed this with anyone, that if -- 1f in
other situations, in other countries, if there had been a similar kind of organized -- well, a
similar kind of resistance, let’s say, and an attempt to save Jews, that things could have
been different in other countries?
A: First of all, that was -- that is not right, with organization. The success was because it
was not organized. It was private -- I mean, here and there, but of course, later, and
during the time, it was organized. What I really mean 1s that if the Pope had done
something in the 30’s, maybe the situa-situation have been different. To me, a situation --
I -- | am proud that the only church who really condemned, was the Danish church. That -

- And it was not just words, because many refugee found a shelter in the vicary, and
many Danish priests were in connection with the resistant movement, and that way, were
helping the refugees to Sweden, send them ta -- send them to -- to other people who was -
- but naturally, if there have been con -- people have condemned this, but who want to
help a Jew?
Q: You’ve talked a lot in this interview, mentioned that -- the feeling of shame, of not
doing enough, and then a -- and then how that -- that feeling shifted, when people --
Danish people began to do so much. In the -- In the era after the war, I -- I wonder if you
could talk about that, the Danish people came out of the war feeling that really, you had
behaved, you had done the right thing. Many people have come out of the war feeling
maybe that they didn’t make good choices, and as -- I -- I read a quote that the Danes did
not lose their souls during the time of Hitler. And I just wonder if you have any thoughts
on that, I mean, whether -- whether you disagree with it, or -- or if it sparks any other
thoughts?
A: I never gave it a -- a thought, because we come -- we came back and we have been
involved all the time, and I know that it was, as I said, with my grandmother’s blessing. I
think the main thought in Denmark, oh, God be praised. We had a very cheap travel. And
-- But we learned from it. Denmark went into NATO. Today we are in Kosovo. We -- I
learned -- to me for -- for instance, that the eur -- eur -- European union is very
important, I z -- have worked for -- and the European movement for 35 years or
something. That was -- NATO and that European movement was in order to avoid war.

We have seen the war, and in the -- the years after the war, we saw the casualties, we saw
the million, we saw the result, we saw the con -- the concentration camps and -- and if
continued in -- in the Soviet Union, where a gulag -- where Stalin killed even more
people than Hitler. But, I thought, naive as I was, that unity in Europe could make us a
better continent. And I really think we have achieved quite a lot in that way. I really think
that for the first time in history, there’s not being a war in 50 years between central
European states. We have, of course, now down at the Balkan, but we have not have this
war between England, France and Germany. England an-and -- and France, to be the
master of Europe. We have had this union which -- and my idea of a -- a union 1s what
Charles DeGaulle said, a Europe of the Fatherlands. We are Danes, we are French, but
we are Europeans, but we are not going to be directed from Brussels. We have our own
parliament, but we have so many common interests. We have the now -- which Denmark,
not are in yet, the eril -- the economy, but we will have it [indecipherable] in some years,
we will also be member of the European -- have the Euro as our currency. And I really
look forward to that. But the question that we should have been proud of ourself now, I
really think there was, in Denmark, very much self criticism of the way we behaved, the
government, the -- the work. They worked too much together with the -- with the German
authorities, but on the other side, we did not lose ourself, that’s right. The -- I was not less
Danes when I returned than before, I really think that. W-We had a much easier time
during the war than most part. Only Sweden had it better. Yeah, they -- that -- so -- and
after the war, I really think that we have made very, very big progresses. We -- And the

situation between the nations in Europe is much better than it was before, and so we have
learned by the war, f-for Denmark to go into NATO, that’s okay. That’s just like to make
a garden on the inlands eyes of -- yes, because we -- It’s so long time we were a wild
Viking nation, we still remembered.
Q: You’ve mentioned Kosovo once or twice, and I just ge -- like to get you to sort of
elaborate a little bit on that, and I must remind people listening to this, that it’s April 16",
1999. It’s about two weeks into a very -- a very fierce bombing of Kosovo and of -- of
Serb -- Serbian forces, by NATO. So, I would just like you to tell us a little bit more
about what you think about the decision to do that, and -- and why y-you think it’s
important or not important.
A: I said before what would happen if, in 1936, we had seen the French attack the
German -- the Nazi German troops. Maybe million of people’s life have been spared.
Every time we stand against a dictator, you will see that he do whatever he want, and
blame always his enemy for what is done. Now, that was the only way out. We had, in
order to still live up to what we are taught, that we are our brother’s keeper, we must
attack people who deny other peoples their freedom. And I can’t see it co-could have
been done another way. Maybe I -- I -- I will not talk about sending in today, ground
troops. What happened today is that a fanatic man dec-decide hundred of thousand
people’s fate. It’s -- It -- He is really a dictator, he’s really danger -- dangerous against
the -- the world society, and to me it’s quite clear when you see the only people who
support him, is the former -- people from the former Soviet Union, and China, and both

of these countries have severe problems when it comes to human rights. And human
rights is one of the thing we mut -- we cannot adjust them. We cannot say that human
rights is for Christian, not for Muslims. So I really think that’s it. Go without saying, we
have to fight against what I call the evil.
Q: The what?
A: The evil.
Q: I’m going to sort of go back a little bit. I wonder if you can tell us anything you
remember right after the war, about trials of collaborators. And I know that there were
some 1-1n -- 1n your country.
A: Well, I was against these trials, because the collaborators who was taken, was a small
fish. And because of the -- the punishment they got, the lowest punishment for four years,
all the small, easy cases, they got four years. But, when the big cases, where the real
criminals came up, oh well, then the softhearted Dane has said, that was too much. The
people who got the four years, they served their time. The others, they got maybe two
years, three years, and nothing hap -- and we had, of course, the severe examples, the
killers, the informers, and -- and some of them were shot. They deserved that, but the
whole s-system of laws we had, first of all, it was against Danish morality to have a law
which punished things what has happened already. You cannot have a law going
backwards.
Q: They had to enact new legislature for this?

A: [indecipherable] I-l-l-legislation, but th-their excuse was that the Council of Freedom,
in ’43, had said, if that and that are done, it’s an offense, and it will be punished after the
war. But, it was not a government, it was -- that had no power but okay, the main ideas in
-- in the law was exactly what the Council of Freedom has said, but the Council of
Freedom had not included this small, unimportant guys, they would have the criminals,
they would have really crimi -- the people who broke our law, who was traitors, but that
was a small, completely inno -- not innocent, but ignorant people who was punished out,
and that was -- and then, if you were lucky and first were taken prisoner three years after
the war, and have done serious crimes, we would not have the death penalty. Children, be
at five, six, seven years, and well, that was wrong done. The idea was right, of course you
sc -- you have to be punished for thing you do, but it was done in the wrong way. They
hit the wrong people.
Q: What -- What about in your town, or Elsinore, what happened to the -- there weren’t
as many, but what happened to the handful of collaborators there?
A: Oh, they were arrested, but wha -- I must say, I’m ashamed of one thing. Quite a lot of
the girls who dating German soldiers, ti -- they were captured and they cut all then
painted swastika on the ma -- I -- I was very upset when I saw that, and that -- that was,
to me that’s -- that’s a shame on -- on the people who did it, I-- was very brave to cut --
take the hair off a girl, that’s -- no, but it normally was people who never had done a
single thing during the war.

Q: The people who were -- who were looking for revenge, had ne -- I’m not sure what
you said.
A: I said that the pe -- the people who -- who did that, never did a single thing until the
war, they were -- they just find out how -- that was funny, that was -- okay, that was
people of the street, and I’m very much ashamed of that. But it happened in all towns all
over Denmark that wrong people was taken prisoner, and wrong thing was done to -- to --
to women.
Q: So what do you think was going on there? Wh-Why did that happen?
A: Because of the ligisation. First of all, because the Council of Freedom wanted to avoid
the Night of the Long Knife, as we had in other countries, where --
Q: The night?
A: Of the long knives. Where, in France, for instance, where many was killed when the
liberation came. Also private problems was taken [indecipherable], then telling this is
because of -- of the war, he is killed or she is killed, he had done so and so. That was --
Therefore, the Council of Freedom wanted to have law, so the people who did something
wrong, should be punished, but not private, this would be by the official authorities. And
we did that -- we did that. The only thing was when the judges of the street, and that went
the wrong way for quite a lot of -- of -- of the girls. S -- I don’t like what they did, I think
that was completely wrong, they -- but punishment, not that way, not that way. That is the
-- the jury of the streets, we -- we can’t have that, not in a society wh-wh-who wants to
have law and order.

Q: How long were you active in the brigade, after the war was over?
A: Oh, for two months, about two months. We were dismissed the 10" of July.
Q: Okay, and what did you do then?
A: Well, when I -- Just enjoyed life. For more than a month, I just went around looking
good friends up and meeting girlfriends, and living a life, and -- and then, in end of
August, the hard work started, I started studying, I went through -- I went to the
mercantile, and --
Q: The Mercantile?
A: Yes, I ha -- merchant high school. Then, it took three, four years, and in the meantime
I got married, and --
Q: Tell us -- Tell us a little bit about your wife.
A: My first wife.
Q: Your first wife.
A: Nice girl, and we met, by the way, in the summer of love, summer of freedom,
summer of everything. The summer the sun was up 24 hours a day. So we
[indecipherable] you know. It was out of this world. That was -- And well, many of these
[indecipherable] coming the first years was maybe a little bit too early for us. And then
my -- the last year at school, at university there, I started in my father-in-law’s company
and stayed there until ’81, long time after we have been divorced, and that -- that made a
rather quick way out of the ri -- was many direction, by now I was 28, and --

A: We are selling chemicals, we are selling products for paint and varnish, plastic and all
this industrious, and medical. And in -- in 1960, I ki -- had my divorce. We had three --
three children, a boy and two girls, and he 1s now a -- well, 1s -- is an old guy now, and he
is, of all places, in the re -- what do you call it, taxation? He’s a lawyer, and they sit there
and -- but ki -- he is a very, very keen civil servant. So -- B-But that’s not my way of life.
But w-we -- w-we -- I see him two or three or four times a month, he lives not -- not so
far away. And then two daughters, one is a teacher, and the other is studying, now it’s art
[indecipherable] studying all their life, and had a wonderful time. And they live both in
Copenhagen, in the same -- s-same apartment house as my former wife. They bought that
-- They bought that some years ago, and they -- they are living, and they are both
divorced, my daughters, I hope, soon, because I want to have more ch -- grandchildren
then. And then in ’60, I suppose, 61, I married Sonia and we have three sons. The oldest
is now main director in our company. [indecipherable] son is director and been working
since 81. And then a son who’s a journalist, he has been here, and who’ll -- who’ll be
back in May, to New York. And then the youngest who has just been in onwha -- enwise
-- enwi --
Q: NYU?
A: NYU. Started on a film course, he wants to be a film maker. And we live in Esbagere,
very near to where I was born, and we have the -- the -- a good reason to go to

and that’s very good.

Q: I want to ask about the speeches and why you come here, but before, do your children
know a lot of your history and wha -- and what you did during the war, and if so, when
did you tell them about it?
A: As I told you, this 1s not a issue in Denmark. When we are talking about what
happened during the war, the -- we will always have this -- our debt, was it the first or the
second World War? That is not an issue, because how could we behave in another way”?
That’s -- Th -- My children, when they see -- for instance when the groups of Jews are
coming to Denmark, are telling that and that, they -- they can’t understand it. Why? Wh-
What could you have done else? So that’s -- that’s not an issue in -- in -- 1n our speech, in
our home.
End of Tape Three, Side A
Beginning Tape Three, Side B

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Preben Munch Nielsen. This is tape number three, side B. Can you talk a little bit about
when you first began making speeches about this?
A: Oh that’s -- I really think that’s about the time with the -- with the boat, when -- ’89, I
suppose it was, that Professor Leo Goldberger asked me to find a boat. We have been
together somewhere and -- and then he -- he asked me to find, and then I make -- and
there was an interview in one of our papers, and the day after, the boat 1s here. And that’s
the boat, you know, and that was fantastic. And then -- And then, the boat it built oak on
oak, and it was from pre-war, and you don’t find them very often, because they were -- it

took quite a lot to make it clear every year, for the season, so -- but the -- the guy who
had it now was the third owner of the boat in this -- almost 50 years. So it was -- And
then --
Q: Let me just clarify something. You’ve mentioned Professor Goldberger before, he’s
Danish?
A: He’s a Danish. His father was cantor of the synagogue in --
Q: Okay, that’s right.
A: -- in -- in Copenhagen.
Q: So, he is involved with the museum, and -- and he contacted you and said, “I -- We
would like to find this boat,” and he sort of gave it to you as a job?
A: Yes. Not the boat, but a boat.
Q: A boat.
A: A boat, and we found the -- this boat and my surprise that it was our boat, was minst --
that has been placed for 50 years, for all the years, in Elsinore, and I have boats in that
same harbor for many, many years.
Q: And you didn’t know that --
A: No, no, no, no. Because it was changed a little bit. The -- And the -- th-the name was
quite different, and that is, you see, el -- in -- in Elsinore port there, the marina, that’s
1200 boats, so you can’t -- can’t see the -- know them all.
Q: How -- How did you search for the boat? Tell me what you did.

A: Oh, well I just was interviewed and asked if anybody knew about a -- a b -- a boat
from -- from the October °43, and then he came with it and said, “I bought that from
Tormul Larsen,” so it was so -- so easy to -- to go back and find the real thing, and
[inaudible]. We had some wonderful pictures the day it was taken up from the harbor and
put on the truck for -- dispatched thing to -- to Baltimore, I suppose it was, yes.
Q: Okay. Do you remember when you found this particular boat and you actually went to
see it? Can -- Can you remember back what it was like to walk back on it?
A: It was wonderful, because when I saw it first, oh it was ugly, it’s ugly. And -- But then
I saw the captain, and there was one thing different, because there was another engine,
and that engine was bigger than the engine that was in the boat before. And, but also the
same thing. You could -- You couldn’t remember. And Tormul Larsen, who was the --
the man who owned it after the war, said he had many good hours in that boat.
Q: Did he -- Did you get a chance to go out on it?
A: Yes, [indecipherable]. But only on the last -- the last trip from -- from -- down to the
harbor where it was put on the truck, and sent to -- to America. And then I saw it in
Baltimore, because we had very, very keen discussions about the color, because the paint
that was used on the boat in that time, was made of fish oil. We hadn’t -- We had no
mineral oil to do it, so 1t was fish oil who was -- that was the -- the main part of it. And
that was fine to -- to find the -- it was gray, in order -- and non-reflecting, you know, not -
- no gl -- [indecipherable] should be non-reflecting the light, in order to have it more
hidden, when they were sailing, as they go, one wi-with the water.

Q: And so it -- Was it brought here on a ship, 1n a container?
A: In a container, on a ship.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah. But that was not our business, because we di -- it was delivered on the pier.
Q: Can you tell us a little bit about -- about when you speak. You said you do it quite
often now. What do you find people are interested in when they hear you speak?
A: First of all, si -- I must say that what I’m speaking of, is why Holocaust failed in
Denmark. We are try to give the historical perspective, to give all the good thing which
happen, with -- with the dates, the time. It was in ’43. With the help from the German,
with the -- the position in Denmark that everybody would help a Jew, that it was not
something uniqued. I want to give that forward, and then, the question 1s, of course, how
did you do it, and all this and -- and I try to te -- also, in humor that there’s been very
funny times. For instance, some of the -- the refugees, they had to stay, because they
couldn’t move the pe -- move the hospitals. And then a nurse asked the -- the -- the
doctor, ““What disease shall we write on the chart here?” “Oh, call it German measles.”
You see, that’s -- that’s typical Danish, typical Danish, that 1f we can have a little bit of
joke, a little bit fun, and also to take the -- the atmosphere. These people lay in their beds,
had maybe a depression, they were afraid and all. And then, call it German measles.
They-- It gives a better atmosphere. So -- And then they asked the story about the king
and the -- the -- the yellow star. And then, the -- always says, why was they not arrested?
Well, because, as I say, nobody of these guys, knew a Jew. They had to ca -- th -- from

the gossip papers and all this. And also try to tell that -- that w-we -- we had food enough
in Denmark, we -- it was not under same control and that it was not an organization. It
was many, many different people who tried to help and okay, there must have been a
guardian angel in one way or another, whether you believe in angels or not.
Q: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, because I think this is in your first
interview, and 1-1-it’s just in speaking to you again, you’re clearly asked over and over,
why did you do this, why did the Danish people help the Jews? And you -- you, over and
over, try to convey why you did it, but you’re also trying to convey a kind of disbelief,
almost, that you get asked this all the time. Almost like a frustration, and --
A: No.
Q: No, not -- But I thi -- But I think it’s very telling, ab -- it 1 -- it’s telling of who you
are.
A: Well, I really think that what we did was a matter of decency. Could I have been able
to look and see myself in the mirror if I had turned my back? It was in ’43, we knew
about the concentration camps, we knew that we had the possibility. We knew that these
people were innocent people. I think that’s -- that’s motivation, must be valued, also for
the people who ask. It’s enough for me. I don’t think we made something unique. I will
never be able to live a -- a country where you’re a hero because you give a helping hand
to a fellow citizen. Or unique be-because you act in a decent way. You see, that’s -- that’s
the whole thing that my belief -- that’s why I’m not for democrac -- lif -- I’m not for
dictatorship. I want to be democratic, but I cannot eat oysters and drink champagne if my

next door neighbor starve. I cannot enjoy my freedom when my next door neighbor, an --
because of nothing, because of innocent work, are punished, because he -- he is a Jew. It
shouldn’t be a crime. And we -- And we cannot accept that. And therefore, I -- I really
find that it was just a matter of decency. And that is why we don’t talk about, that’s not
issue. That my children, they would have hated me, if I had done nothing.
Q: H-How do you make sense of the fact, though, that so many other people do? That
they want to applaud you for what you do, that they do single you out, that they do talk
about it? I mean, how do you make sense of that?
A: Pll have to answer with a joke. Once there was a man who came to me and said,
“Why are you always so happy?” And [indecipherable] say, “Okay, in the morning, I s-
stand up, go out, shave me, and see me in the -- in the mirror.” “I do the same,” he said.
And then I ask, “Yes, but you don’t see me in the mirror.”
Q: Let me see, h-how did your initial interview with the museum come about in 1989? D-
Do you know who recommended, or did you offer to do an interview?
A: No, no, no, no, I was asked to -- to do it, and because we have been on L Street there,
several times, and because I was involved in the boat. And -- And maybe Leo Goldberger
have said I should -- could give some -- some views on this. And today, because I’m the
only survivor of the -- of the rescuer, not only, but you know.
Q: Almost only.
A: Uh-huh.

Q: Y-You come frequently, and you’ve participated in a celebration at as -- a synagogue
nearby. I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about that.
A: They have a -- They call it a Garden of Righteous, and every year they honor a person
who have helped the Jews. And I was honored some years ago, and I can mention that
Professor Kaska is one and Frau Welnber another, so I’m in a very wonderful company.
So -- But I find that a very beautiful day and we meet quite a lot of the good friends we
have here in Washington area, and we love to be here. And one thing more, it’s at the
right time. You see, time means something. We come here and have spring two weeks
before we have it in Denmark, and we long for spring, after gray, very dull winter, to land
in the airport here, 20 degrees Celsius, go down and see green trees, lots of flowers
blooming [indecipherable]. That’s wonderful.
Q: What do you think of the current -- the last few years there’s bis -- perhaps an
intensified interest in -- in the Holocaust. There have been documentaries, and of course,
the movie “Schindler’s List,” which won many awards. A-A-Ha -- What do you think of
all of that? D-Do you think there is a genuine interest, or is it perhaps maybe just a kind
of a fad, or how do you make sense of it?
A: It’s very difficult, because we have seen, after the war, many thing which goes near
Holocaust. We see it today in Kosovo, we saw it at Rwanda some years ago. We see it in
Sudan, Muslims again Christian, we see that in India. We see that in the former Soviet
Union. I think that it’s also the interest in -- in avoiding -- avoiding a new Holocaust.
Therefore, I -- when I participate, many times, it 1 -- a part of an Holocaust education, and

I really think that the Holocaust education maybe can give us some answers how to avoid
it. 1 mean, education is one of the things, when you see round the world, people living
next to each other in different countries, they believe the other country will do that and
that and vice-a - versa. And they fear it, they don’t know. The more we’re able to know
about our neighbor countries -- neighbor countries, it will help. I don’t believe that we are
able to make countries love each other, but could we, through education, make them hate
a little less, we would had achieved quite a lot. But, I think it’s so important, with the
Holocaust education, and a part of the Holocaust education is also “Schindler’s List.”
Last year here, we watch a preview of a picture about the Danish rescue of the Jews, and
it was not so special, truthful, but it was a good story, and -- but it gives the impression
all the time, that we can do something. Not to avoid it, but to dimin-diminish the results
of it. We -- We must do something, we must learn people to do what we, as Christian or
Jews, are taught. That we are our brothers and sisters keeper. If we live up to that, I really
think that it will be a much easier way to live, and a more lucky world.
Q: How -- What is the situation in your country now, with Jews? Is -- Is it similar, has it
shifted in any way? Have you ever seen a period where there was some anti-Semitism?
A: Never. I can tell you, last time there was anti-Semitism in Denmark, was in 1 -- 1813.
And there was something unique, because th -- that -- this year, 1813, the Jews got full
Danish citizenships and were allowed to trade on the exchange. And some of the Dane --
other Danish -- non-Jewish merchants there, were very annoyed about that. And they
hired some people to beat the Jews. And some of the Jews were beaten badly. But, the

king made an action. The people who was hired was jailed, and the merchant who paid
them was fined very hard. Since that day there have been no anti-Semitism in Denmark.
And I -- There won’t be ba -- for instance, we have lots of literature in Denmark written
by Jews, but all in Danish. In other country, y-you will see, in Yiddish or in -- in Hebrew,
but the Danish -- by accident Jewish, authors, write in Danish. They’re a -- an important
part of our literature. And therefore, the Jews are not something different. They are not
living in ghettos, they can be your next door neighbor. They are -- During the war, during
the occupation, one of the chefs of the department of Social Affair, was a Jew. Today, y-
y-you don’t -- y-y-y-y -- that 1s -- that is not a question to put because why should there
be?
Q: Well, in preparing for this interview, I did read one thing that right after that war, that
there was a -- a few situations of anti-Semitism and that people attributed it to the Nazis
had sown some seeds, and -- and then it -- it kind of was pushed away again, but that --
that it was hard right after the war, and some people were grumbling and saying, oh,
everything’s the Jews fault. This I read, but I think that it, the source of it was Rabbi
Melchior. And he said that it was very short-lived, but that it -- it -- there was just that
moment, and I -- so I was curious about that.
A: Well, normal -- normally I quite agree wi -- I don’t know the -- we have several
Melchior. The -- The rabbi who said in the synagogue in ’43, was the other -- that was
Marcus Melchior, and his -- hi -- that he wrote, “That was a Golden Heart,” when he
returned. And the other, Ben Melchior, he just retired last year, and I haven’t seen that,

about that, but maybe something I have overlooked, but today, that’s nothing, nothing. I -
- Because everything we were against, as a nation, was nascism, and I will be very
unhappy to believe that one of the most nasty things with nascism, should have been
survived id -- in Denmark. I think that’s -- No, well I -- I can’t -- I can’t understand it.
Q: H-How -- How is what you did and many, many others of Danes, how is that
commemorated in your country?
A: Not at all.
Q: Not at all.
A: Why should it? Why should it? We have our Friends of the Sound. We meet once or
tw-twice a year, and we have our tradition.
Q: Oh, Friends of the Sound is your -- re-really, your -- the group that did all this work
with the rescues and the boats, or --
A: No, no, no, that -- that is -- that is a -- a union of all this who did.
Q: Okay.
A: Because ha -- Elsinore’s Sewing Club is one, and -- but the Friends of the Sound was
founded by t -- Mr. Thompson, he was an innkeeper and he died in concentration camp.
Q: And what do you do when you meet? The Friends of the Sound.
A: What I do?
