This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This is a follow-up interview that will focus on Mr. Stein\u2019s post Holocaust experiences. In preparation for this interview I listened to the interview you conducted with the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation on February 27\", 1997. I will not ask you to repeat everything you said in that interview, instead I will use this interview as an opportunity to follow up on that interview and focus on your post-Holocaust experiences.

Karl was changed to Charles, but it \u2014 actually, I didn't change it. It was changed by the authorities in Luxembourg when they issued me a passport. They simply wrote in there, and my name in \u2014 in that Luxembourg stateless passport on which I traveled after I left Austria was \u2014 they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It was a \u2014 1t was a horrible experience. Knowing that my parents must be in one of those, I \u2014 I sort of instinctively started looking around to see if I could see my parents.

And we were there for about a day or two, I did interrogate some of the guards. They \u2014 some of them, as I recall, were Ukrainian guards that the survivors of \u2014 of the camp \u2014 many of them by the way in Nordhausen w-was one of the camps that had a lot of slave labors from eastern Europe, a lot of Yugoslavs that I encountered there. They wanted those guards. And if I lost any of them on the way, I \u2014 I-I can\u2019t remember. But they \u2014 the guards were scared. I recall one guard, who absolutely refused to talk. And we had ways of, you know, interrogate \u2014 ways of interrogate \u2014 this \u2014 this was not a friendly interrogation, so we made them talk. Not by physical force in any way, but by \u2014 oh, various things. Like we have him take off his clothes. And when a man stands there in front of you without his clothes on, he\u2019ll start talking pretty soon, we found out. That\u2019s an interesting thing we learned over \u2014 over the \u2014 we sort of picked up as we went through the war and \u2014 interrogation techniques that they didn\u2019t teach us in school. But he f \u2014 he talked and I got \u2014 I got his story, of course, I can\u2019t remember the details now. But I did get a \u2014 the story of some of the atrocities that the \u2014 they were \u2014 they committed. I turned the people over \u2014 the \u2014 the guards over to the military police that picked them up and took them back to prison camps. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I went to officer candidate school and became \u2014 I was an artillery officer. And then I was, shortly after graduation at Fort Sill, Oklahoma where the artillery school was, I was tapped for intelligence because of my background in languages and so forth. I was called one night \u2014 one evening I was called in and was told that Washington, in quotes, at that time wanted me to go to \u2014 wanted me to go to the intelligence school, which was at Fort Ritchie, right in \u2014 1n Maryland here, then called Camp Ritchie. That was the military intelligence school and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training. Oh, we learned all kinds of things like Morse code, which I have never used in my life. Don\u2019t know anybody who ever did, and folder interpretation, map reading of foreign maps, which was important because some of the captured maps we had to \u2014 to know what we saw, and we had all kinds of field training with those.

I remember one night that they dropped me off someplace at a place and gave me this \u2014 this map. And from landmarks and all that, you identified where you were and which way you were going. Well, that was important but in \u2014 basically for me that was not a problem because I was fluent in German, of course, my native language, I also knew French. And that\u2019s the direction we went in, so once we got there, I could easily read those maps if \u2014 if necessary. We were trained in order of battle, identifying \u2014 we learned everything about the German \u2014 we knew more about the German army, their uniforms, their \u2014 their insignia. That was all part of \u2014 of the training and the units, the organization of the German army, what units looked like, what they were, how ba \u2014 how strong they were, etcetera. That was all part of it because that was all part of \u2014 of the interrogation process. And so when we \u2014 when I got into \u2014 to the combat are \u2014 zone, interrogating the people was simple. One thing, for example, was that every German had what was called a soldbuch, a paybook. Now that soldbuch \u2014 soldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there. And it was easy to figure out who he was and what he was. So the first thing we\u2019d ask them is, give me your soldbuch. And they would hand it over and you had them right there, that was \u2014 now you knew. And so then you would say, oh you were from the 338\" This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And he\u2019d say yeah, and take it from there. Most of the interrogations were actually not difficult. Most of them talked. Now you ran into some, officers mainly, who said name, rank and serial number, that\u2019s all they would give you. But again, you \u2014 we \u2014 all of us, I think, found ways to \u2014 to break them. For example is one thing, a German, regardless of whether you were friend or enemy, respected rank. So you made sure that the insignia you were \u2014 you were wearing at the time, and we had a complete collection of it, were at least one rank higher than the man we had, and we could read that. So we \u2014 we played that game, it was \u2014 if you had time for it. Now a lot of \u2014 most of it was right up in the front lines, so you didn\u2019t have time to \u2014 to play games. And at those times we would just play tough, yeah. Threaten, all kinds of things, you know, we would \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019d say \u2014 we\u2019d tell them, okay, we\u2019ll let you walk back home, right through the front lines. Of course they wouldn\u2019t do that cause they\u2019d get shot. And things like that, and they would \u2014 I don\u2019t really recall anyone I could not break in an \u2014 in an interrogation, and I\u2019ve interrogated thousands of them. Now, what we did with the information, and we \u2014 we \u2014 in my case, being in the front lines, I would \u2014 my targets were who was opposing us, how strong are they, where are they located, what kind of weapons do they have, where\u2019s their artillery. And I would immediately call in to artillery to give them the coordinate of locations so that they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And that went \u2014 well, we had a lot of good results. One of the things that I and my team always did was when we had specific targets that we could identify, after we had pushed through the area we checked those targets to make su \u2014 to see if they had been hit like we \u2014 and I think most of them were. So, it was \u2014 in Normandy it was \u2014 is rough, cause we were going from hedgerow to hedgerow, you know, one hedgerow at a time, and you know, a hundred \u2014 a hundred yards a day, things like that. But after that, of course, on the run, that was a little different. Once we broke through, it was \u2014 it was a different story, it was easier then."

We were \u2014 all of \u2014 not \u2014 I\u2019m not just talking about the \u2014 the front line type intelligence, but the OSS didn\u2019t exist until just about that time. And they had never, the people in the OSS were not what the British had trained for years and years as intelligence officers. We all learned fr \u2014 by \u2014 by doing. The \u2014 I had some contact with OSS people afte \u2014 on \u2014 well, on \u2014 actually still in Europe, but on the way home. They were going home at the same time, and I listened to some of their stories. They were dropped \u2014 one particular I remember, who was an artist, or at least that is what he \u2014 he faked. He was of Italian descent, a New Yorker who spoke Italian. He was dropped into Normandy and he sat around painting. He was \u2014 to the Germans he was an Italian painter visiting here, and was friendly right, to \u2014 Italy was a friendly country. And that\u2019s the way he collected intelligence. But he said he had absolutely no idea what he was doing when he first got in there. He got in by parachute, got \u2014 the French helped him \u2014 French underground helped him. And then he \u2014 he sat aro \u2014 he tha \u2014 he started painting and reporting and they had equipment to \u2014 to report. And he was around Normandy and the Sherbrooke(ph) peninsula doing this artwork. Course na \u2014 he brought nothing home. He all gave that to \u2014 to his French comrades there.

Everything was \u2014 whatever we did was done for the first time, on the U.S. side. And now, as I said, the British, of course, had been doing their in intelligence work, collection of intelligence all over the world with the \u2014 with the colonies and all that. So \u2014 a-and in World War II, of course, they\u2019d been in the war for three years before we came in, or almost three years. That was wa-why I said that their \u2014 their intelligence was better, they were better organized. We were just learning, but we got there. We \u2014 just like everything else, I think, in the \u2014 1n the U.S. Army. That army had absolutely no experience, we came from all over the place. Nobody \u2014 there were no real soldiers at th \u2014 in 1941. By 1944 we did the \u2014 the biggest \u2014 biggest job ever done in any \u2014 any invasion. And it was successful. So I guess as Americans, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re quick learners. We picked up an awful lot from the British. They were very helpful. They taught us then. The schools that I went to in \u2014 in London during that period were very informative, because we talked to people who had been there, who had been there, done that and told us how \u2014 how they did whatever we were doing later on.

His mother-in-law was mentally incompetent and she was in \u2014 in Vienna in a place that was known to me, that was the insane asylum in Vienna, there was one big one. And she had been killed, and he told me that they were killing these \u2014 well, handicapped people, mentally handicapped. They didn\u2019t need them, so they killed them.

But th \u2014 it-1t\u2019s that kind of thing that \u2014 that those are interesting little things that happened. There were many of them, of the different nature. For example, in the Battle of the Bulge, the unit I was with was holding one of the \u2014 you know, the corners of \u2014 of the thing. We were not penetrated, but we \u2014 we \u2014 we went in there to hold it, and that was in the famous Battle of the Hiirtgen Forest. And there was a German lieutenant colonel in there with his troops, holding out. And we could \u2014 it\u2019s a dense forest and we just couldn't get him out.

What was his name? Well, can\u2019t remember. Anyhow, so who was sent in to bring \u2014 yeah, he was sick. He was very sick and he wanted to surrender.

But he was on his own, just started talking as we carried him out. His own men carried him on a stretcher. And we came out of the forest and then we waited until he was evacuated. And he just told us all kinds of war stories, was just great. Good information. Not necessarily tactical information, but strategically important of how decisions were made and all that. Well, we took that down and got it back to higher headquarters and I don\u2019t know what they did with it, but at least the information was there.

And at the same time, I had \u2014 this was now early 1946, and I had talked to a lot \u2014 lot of people, you know, after returning and I found out how all these people made all this money, in all kinds of things. And I said maybe I ought to do \u2014 make a little money, I had none. I had whatever I had saved from my army pay, which wasn\u2019t very much. I wasn\u2019t working, I had not found a way to \u2014 to do anything and so I said why, why don\u2019t I do something else first? So I\u2014 I dropped Palestine and I dropped medicine and I went into the export business. Opened my own busin \u2014 I took \u2014 well, first of all I had to learn something about the export, and that was the big thing then that I \u2014 I found out. And I had to learn something about it. Fortunately 1-in the newspapers I found a two week course that would teach me all about it, and that\u2019s exactly what I did, I\u2014 I went \u2014 I mean, this is strictly an amateur performance at the time. I went and took a two week course and I knew all about it, I knew how to \u2014 what kind of documents you needed, and how \u2014 and all I needed now 1s to find out what I was going to sell and where. Well, I and a fr \u2014 a\u2014 a wartime buddy of mine, friend, we\u2019d been through the war together, and I, decided we\u2019d go into the export business, and we did. And we si \u2014 decided that the electrical appliances were a good thing, we \u2014 I guess we liked electrical appliances, so we went into that and we decided that we would do South America \u2014 Latin America as \u2014 as our target.

Went into business, we \u2014 we got in contact with some manufacturers of appliances, and we went to various embassies and asked for their importer \u2014 lists of importers, which was available. And we started writing let \u2014 by that time, by the way, I had taken, soon as it came back, I started taking a Spanish \u2014 I don\u2019t know why, but the G.I. bill was there and I didn't know what else to do with it until I went to medical school, which would have been \u2014 so I took Spanish and I was fairly fluent in Spanish by that time, it was now middle of 1946. By that time we \u2014 we got to the point where I n \u2014 I needed. And so I wrote up a catalog in Spanish, we put that up and a \u2014 a letter to all the customers and began working. Pretty soon we were making a little money, not very much. Not enough to live on, but there was still a G.I. bill that helped us out with that. And it lasted for \u2014 until early 1948. In early 1948 there was a sudden stop of dollars. The dollar was no longer available for payment to foreign countries, there was a shortage of d \u2014 of dollars, there was \u2014 there were \u2014 there were exchange restrictions. And so the big com-companies could give, you know, six months credit to \u2014 to compan \u2014 the little companies, like ours, we couldn\u2019t give any credit, we worked strictly as letter of credit.

I \u2014 so I went around and went to an employment office, one of those employment agencies and they said yeah, as a matter of fa \u2014 it was on 46\" Street and Fifth Avenue, I remember. And they said yeah, we have a job. There\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a job opened right across the street here at a place called Nancy Studios, hat makers. Feather hats.

I-It was a strange \u2014 you know, being called darling by these floating characters who were dressed in diff \u2014 1-1t was not \u2014 not my \u2014my cup of tea.

I came home one day in September, it was September of \u201948, and I looked at my mail and there was a letter there from the Pentagon. I opened it up and it said, dear Captain Stein, we want you back. We have a special project here which 1s right in line with your experience during the war and please call this number. So I called the number in \u2014 in the \u2014 in Washington and talked to a major and he said \u2014 he told me what it was. It was in the office of the chief of military history, translating the experiences of the German general staff that apparently the United States had under contract of some sorts, in and out of jail in Germany, that were writing their heart out about their experiences on the eastern front in Russia.

Looked like it. And I said look, I have \u2014 you\u2019re sending me to Korea with a 93-16. I don\u2019t speak any of those languages.

I knew there was nothing \u2014 yeah \u2014 well, I talked to this major and he said, do you speak Korean? I said nope. He said, Japanese? The Koreans in the \u2014 in the army at that time grew up under Japanese occupation, so most of them spoke \u2014 still spoke some Japanese, too. I said nope. He said, Chinese? I said, nope.

He said, oh, I don\u2019t want your report, I know all about what\u2019s going on up there. I just sent you up there because nobody works for me who doesn\u2019t get his feet wet. You know what the war is like, now you can start working on it. Was a good idea. Not for \u2014 for \u2014 not while we were up there.

But the law expired on the first of April 1953. So all of us who were in Korea in52 had to be home and out of the army by \u2014 by the first of April, and the army decided that they were going to get us out by January to give us a chance \u2014 to give us time to get back to the United States and get processed out.

I tried the Red Cross and the HIAS and the jayce \u2014 the JDC, the Jewish community in Vienna who in 1946 did send me a \u2014 a little form letter saying your parents were deported through Litzmannstadt and did not appear on any survivor lists.

Of course, there was still, and I think now thinking back of tha \u2014 to that period, and I\u2019ve done this for some time now, there was always that, why did they have to die and I \u2014 I survived?

And it \u2014 th \u2014 it was \u2014 it was just difficult and unless I was asked, I didn\u2019t tell. It was that way.

As a matter of fact, the \u2014 no, one was German, one was Austrian.

What happened was the air force was the, in55 was getting into the \u2014 the technological age of information processing. They were the leaders in the thing. They had come up with a project that was worked up with IBM and Eastman-Kodak, a combined project of information processing where the information, that is documents, would be photographed on microfilm, and at the same time, there would be an encoding placed on the microfilm and the coding was then read electronically from the film, and would \u2014 and when you \u2014 when you got the right \u2014 right thing, looking for a specific document that contained a subject matter, th-the subject matter was coded.

We had to type punch cards and whatever, or type it into the computer and then it would come \u2014 you \u2014 th \u2014 this way you could just photograph it. Well, it was a novel thing, and that is what they \u2014 they were hiring people to do that. My job, I became a \u2014 I was hired as the chief of the coding section, and I worked with the tech \u2014 technical part, the \u2014 the contractors on what they were doing and to make sure that we\u2019re do \u2014 and we developed \u2014 and again, we did this with the CIA, a\u2014 a code \u2014 a code dictionary, sort of.

And then we would have \u2014 this was my section then, readers read the documents that were coming in, intelligence documents, reports from all over the world, and numerically code what was in that document. That document would then be photographed with the code input also onto the film, and it was available for \u2014 for retrieval. We had gotten that thing, it took a number of years to \u2014 to do this, we worked from \u201955 to about \u2014 by \u201958 or 59 we had the first installation, and it worked. We then expanded that to the rest of the air force, and I went out to help the installation of the thing at \u2014- in Omaha at the Strategic Air Command. And in Ohio at the Air Force Research and Development command and several other places, and we started sending out copies of what we had made the film into those.

Or you could view it on a\u2014 on a microfilm viewer. That was the main project. Now, it \u2014 we got into \u2014 more into different arrangements. That unit then was taken over with a lot of the other air force intelligence into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was established. And I was still in charge of that, but I was working on new developments, now we were into computer information, handling a computer. It was all intelligence handling. I was not, at that point any more directly involved with the intelligence, but with the technical operation. And it was that, and DIA just a follow on to the same thing. And it was that thing that State Department got interested in. And when I got into State Department, again, they formed a separate unit to start an information processing operation in the State Department, they didn\u2019t have any. As I found out later, they didn\u2019t want any. The foreign service offices, they didn\u2019t want to have information.

Where do they get their information from and how could we put this into a system? In other words, we were systems development. And we then got money through a \u2014 probably my most grueling and demeaning experience in my life. I had to testify before Congress, before a congressional committee. It \u2014 the man, my immediate superior in that particular thing, was lost. He and I were sitting there, I was in the left hand seat. The left hand seat 1s the \u2014 when you\u2019re facing the committee is the \u2014 the secondary. I was the one with the information, he was the one that answered the questions. And a certain congressman from Brooklyn destroyed my buddy. The man was so confused he didn\u2019t know what to say and the chairman of the committee excused him and said at this point you\u2019re not answering any more questions, but your sidekick answers the questions, so let him answer it and you\u2019re excused, and he wal \u2014 had to leave the \u2014 the committee room.

And when the congressman asked a trick question, the guy went this way. So my eye was on him, and I got through the thing, it worked. I was right, that that was the way, that he knew \u2014 these people know the answers. When they ask a question they know the answer. And so \u2014 they want confirmation of their knowledge, and well anyhow, it \u2014 that \u2014 that was \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was a sad thing.

The program was, oh about half way through, and we got more money, because we showed that it was good. This time we didn\u2019t have to testify any more, 1t was done in the higher-ups.

Again, there\u2019s a political thing. The assistant Secretary of State I worked for and another assistant Secretary of State, who wanted that unit, the other one, th-the \u2014 the enemy there, the other one was the assistant secretary for administration, who had the computer operation of the State Department, the payroll, in other words. Payroll and personnel and whatever, but never anything subst \u2014 substance \u2014 substantive 1n information, they\u2019d never handle it. But they saw something that hadn\u2019t \u2014 that got money and all kinds of possible \u2014 and they wanted it. Well, it was a time when my assistant secretary wanted another job. He wanted to be a \u2014 what do they call that? A diplomat in residence at the university. We had \u2014 the university, they have a diplomat in residence, that a \u2014 that\u2019s a cream puff, absolutely. And usually that led to an ambassadorship. People who were s \u2014 who were selected for that. Well, he was pretty close to that, he wanted an ambassadorship eventually, and he want \u2014 but there was a job that he could have had, but they kept him because he had things going on in his o-operation that were not finished, they wouldn\u2019t let him go. So he changed. He sold us a \u2014 he sold my \u2014 my organization to administration. And I said, I\u2019m not available for that. You can transfer it, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m out. I\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t work for those people, I \u2014 well, I knew them, I had worked with them before.

And he said, I didn\u2019t think you would, but I\u2019ve got another job for you, if you want it. We have a new inspector general and I\u2019ve told him about how you go about doing your investigations and how you can do these things and \u2014 and he\u2019s interested in you, because you\u2019ve reviewed, you know what this whole department is doing, you\u2019ve done a survey to \u2014 to find out what they need, and he wants to talk to you. And he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s brand new, he just came an \u2014 an ambassador who just came back and got the job as Inspector General. So I made an appointment, went to see him and he said, yeah, I want you. And I became a senior foreign service inspector. Now again, I shifted jobs without try \u2014 even trying, you know, I \u2014 I\u2014 I was asked to. And when I got into the Inspector General\u2019s office, that I hadn\u2019t used before, cause they were not in the substantive area, I found that I was in \u2014 in very good company, because most of the senior inspectors were former ambassadors for whom there was no other assignment, there was a limited assignment. And so they became inspectors and they traveled around from one embassy to the other, to make sure that everything was all right, and they were doing, you know, reviewing the embassies, mainly. The idea I came up with, that sold m \u2014 sold me to \u2014 to the inspection corps was that there ma \u2014 are many things that are overlapping that are not being looked at in Washington, th-the various bureaus, each one working as an independent thing, each one working with all the embassies that their \u2014 you know, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Charles Stein \"\u00b0 June 8, 1999 the European bureaus, working with all the European embassies, but there\u2019s no \u2014 no connection between them. They\u2019re doing all kind \u2014 I said, I would like to look into that. He said that\u2019s a great idea, you got it. So I started out on that and I became \u2014 I was doing \u2014 what\u2019d we call that? Well, the organizational reviews. And I did some of those. As I went on, I did all the \u2014 the bureaus, and particularly those that covered in substance more than an embassy. The scientific bureau \u2014 scientific and \u2014 and technical bureau, for example, had these technical attach\u00e9s out there that weren\u2019t talking to each other. So, there \u2014 it was a question of \u2014 of getting information to them and \u2014 I mean, getting information between them and not just reporting back to the bureau and the thing gets lost in the bureau. And the consular offices, for \u2014 of course, there are consulates in every country and more than there are embassies, and they\u2019re not talking to each other. They\u2019re reporting 1n, it\u2019s all a one way flow, nothing goes out \u2014 oh, excuse me \u2014 to \u2014 to all the others. And so I started working on that and I usually got a couple of other officers assigned to me, some of the junior officers that were also working with the inspectors and we sat down and we ju \u2014 started interviewing and looking into the records and all that, we find out how things were and sort of rewrote the \u2014 the \u2014 the job descriptions. The \u2014 the job [indecipherable]. I had one particular one that was of great interest to me, having been a refugee once, and that was, I came across, while I was looking at This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Charles Stein 7 June 8, 1999 these various organizations in the department of a special assistant to the Secretary of State for Refugee Affairs. When I looked into that I found that the man was a political appointee. He\u2019d made big contributions to somebody and he had a few people in Washington, but his work was being done in Geneva at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. In the process I also found that there was a special assistant to the Secretary of State for international Red Cross affairs. Now here we have the international Red Cross, a British a \u2014 a Swiss organization, and they have a one man office with one secretary who\u2019s a special assistant and who handles contacts with that. But the international Red Cross is in Geneva and who handles the \u2014 the br \u2014 the work? The office in Geneva. And this 1s a large office in the united na \u2014 in the mission to the United Nations. The U.S. mission. And I found a third one, a-a another special assistant for a humanitar \u2014 for \u2014 not for humanitarian, for disaster relief affairs. Again, all of them political appointees. Well, I went \u2014 so I went to Geneva and talked to the people there and looked and see what they were doing and they were hardworking people. They were doing the budgeting for \u2014 for these various operations. They were representing the U.S. before the United Nations and before all the various organizations that physically handled refugees and disasters and so forth. And I came back and I wrote a \u2014 oh, about a 200 page report. This was about a six months affair. I wrote a rit \u2014 I wrote a report and I said, reorganize This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Charles Stein \u201d June 8, 1999 the whole thing and my s \u2014 my recommendation was that \u2014 to get another position as an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Humanitarian affairs, all this comes under that subject heading and abolish these special assistants. Have Geneva do the work and have Washington have a \u2014 a regular office doing whatever is necessary in the United States, such as you know, budget \u2014 getting \u2014 getting money and so forth. And that was finished in 1990 \u2014 in January of 19 four \u2014 four \u2014 1974, I finished that particular report. And then I went on and was doing \u2014 I think the next one was consular affairs and I was just about finished with consular affairs when one day I get a phone call from the refugee office. The deputy to this political appointee was a regular foreign service officer whom I knew, I had contact with. And he calls me and he said, I have a problem. We\u2019ve seen your report and I think it\u2019s great. They thought they were getting to be the assistant secretary job. They were \u2014 they were the biggest one, of course. Anyhow, we tha \u2014 we thought we \u2014 we have a \u2014 we have a problem, our man in Geneva, our \u2014 the head of the office just informed us that he is retiring in August. This is about the fifth \u2014 I think it was the day after the Fourth of July weekend, I\u2019d just come back. And he said, you\u2019re the only one who knows what\u2019s going on out there. How would you like to go to Geneva? And my answer to that, and I remember that to this day and will always remember it, was don\u2019t bother me with details, send five tickets. We had a meeting after that, he explained This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And six weeks later we were in Geneva and I was running that office. And I\u2019d gotten, of course, I was at the time \u2014 this \u2014 the main job of that particular office really, was handling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30,000 a year. That was the beginning of the \u2014 the major exodus from Russia. What they were doing, and I was doing for the next four years was dealing with the voluntary agencies, HIAS, Tolstoy Foundation, the International Catholic Migration Commission, the World Council of Churches and many others. The \u2014 the Polish American refugee, or Czech American. All of those, all over Europe. They \u2014 tho \u2014 they were physically receiving these refugees, most of them, of course, Jews. All of them, probably. And were trying to resettle them in Israel, in the U.S., in Australia, wherever. And my job was to make sure that the U.S. money that went to these agencies for handling that, was properly used, that they were doing their job, and make sure that they were doing what they were supposed to do in the resettlement process. And I learned a lot about Russians during that period, and others, but mainly the Russians. Went to one of my jobs and the family was in Geneva, the kids were in international schools, which was a good experience for them, and my job was making \u2014 reviewing the budgets, reviewing their budget requests and changing them where it was necessary. They were all inflated, of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I was the first \u2014 first stop. And \u2014 and actually, physically looking at them, periodically. So every month I would be in one or \u2014 or two, I\u2019d be in \u2014 in \u2014in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and I\u2019d be in \u2014 in\u2014 in Munich, where many of them were. In Rome, which were the main parts and occasionally in Moscow and then Bucharest, behind the Iron Curtain then, talking to our people. And Turkey is \u2014 it was another place. Italy. Several places in Italy where they \u2014 these people were, and working with them to expedite the process. I had one critical, really critical thing. That was, the Kurds in Iran, Iran would not let them out and it was a long process and finally they wouldn\u2019t let any \u2014 finally they decide that yes, they could leave and so we would \u2014 wanted to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2019t allow us. And the international Red Cross, I involved them in it, and the international Red Cross was going to send in a plane and they wouldn\u2019t let them. And finally there was a\u2014acharter from \u2014 Lufthansa had a charter service and the international Red Cross managed to get one of their planes, and they gave in. Now, these people were to be brought out, the \u2014 they \u2014 ere \u2014 ira \u2014 ara \u2014 Iranians gave in and let them go. The people \u2014 the \u2014 the law, there was a special law that Congress enacted to let these people into the United States but it expired on a certain date, which was about \u2014 we were one day away from that date when the thing \u2014 when the Iranians gave in and the Red Cross took the plane over, got the people up and got them to This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I went to Frankfurt to work with our consulate to make sure that these people get their visas. It was just \u2014 they had to get their passports stamped. That was it. What ha \u2014 when they got to the United States was unimportant, but before that date \u2014 oh, this was the day. I get to \u2014 to Frankfurt and they\u2019re processing it, doing a good job, and they still got about a \u2014 about a hundred people at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the consul \u2014 the U.S. consul says well, we\u2019re gonna have to continue that tomorrow, we\u2019re going home. I said no, you\u2019re not. He said well, yeah, but you know, the day is over. I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as I\u2019m concerned it\u2019s midnight in Washington, not in Frankfurt. And it is five o\u2019clock and it\u2019s noon, we got 12 hours to go, you\u2019ve got to finish these people. He says no, I can\u2019t do that. I said, I want a line to the assistant secretary for consular affairs, whom I knew well. I had done a job for her before I left and we had good \u2014 good relationship. And he got \u2014 he says okay, so he got the line through. He couldn\u2019t refuse me, so he got the line. And I talked to the lady and I said, I\u2019ve got a reluctant [indecipherable] I\u2019m \u2014 we\u2019re doing the Kurds, and she said yeah, yeah, how you doing? I said we \u2014 there\u2019s still about a hundred left that have not, and \u2014 been visa\u2019d and your man here wants to go home, he wants to close up. She said, let me have him. I said \u2014 handed him the telephone and I notice his face getting longer and longer and he hung up and he said okay, we\u2019ll work until it\u2019s finished.

Everybody had their visa, stamped with today\u2019s date \u2014 with that day\u2019s date and the next day we got them on a plane and sent them to the U.S. But those are the kind of things that you \u2014 the troubleshooting type things that \u2014 that you had to do every once in awhile. Had to intervene in Rome with the Russians. The Russians in \u2014 in \u2014 in Rome were treated very nice, they had them out on the \u2014 on the li \u2014 li \u2014 just like they have in New York, in Brighton Beach, they all live out there. In Rome they had them out on the \u2014 on \u2014 near the Lido someplace \u2014 not Lido, whatever the beach 1s. Nicely quartered. Then you came into town to \u2014 and HIAS was handling most of the Russians in th\u2014 Rome. And they walked in and he said \u2014 and their \u2014 their \u2014 their questions were, where is my money, where is my house, where is my servants, where is my wi \u2014 the Russian way. The Russians were used to asking for some \u2014 the government. The government gave them. They were still in that mode. And we had some serious problems there, the people were intimidated by them. And I told them, don\u2019t be intimidated, you\u2019ve got \u2014 they had Russian speakers there, and they were \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I told them how \u2014 how to talk to these people. Just yell at them. Tell them to go away, they get nothing. One more word out of you and you\u2019re out, you get nothing, you go wherever you want to go. And it \u2014 it worked. It worked, you know.

They had something coming to them. We told them that no, you don\u2019t have anything coming to you, we\u2019re giving it to you because we\u2019re good people. And in that particular case, and there were a lot of them there, the word got to all of them, I was the United States government. I represent \u2014 see, those were just an organization. When I came, I was the United States government. Well that \u2014 that made \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that did it. When the government says you gotta be quiet, you\u2019re quiet. So we\u2019re \u2014 you know, it was game playing, but \u2014 1t was \u2014 it was acting. I did not go to Hollywood after that. That\u2019s \u2014 you know, experiences like that, that was \u2014 that was my job. And of course I saw a lot of misery too, people coming out and having to sit in those camps in some areas, they were not too pleasant. Some intellectuals, people with \u2014 who had status and \u2014 and now were begging, in effect. I felt for them, but on the other hand, I was there too, once, and I knew how they felt. So, you know, you treated them accordingly. You talked to them, and particularly in some cases when I talked to them, I told them who I was, and I said, I was in your position once, and look at me now. It\u2019s gonna happen to you, just take it easy. It\u2019Il be done. We\u2019re doing it, but it takes time. And it helped a little, some cases, I \u2014 I hope it did."

When I got back to Washington I applied for commission again. I decided I \u2014 I want to stay in, mainly because it \u2014 that pays, at the end. I had never known until 1957, approximately \u201957 1s when I came back in, that reserve offices who had active duty at age 60 would get money. And I said well, why not? Somebody talked me into it, really. Somebody told me about that, one of the people I wor \u2014 I worked with. They said, why don\u2019t you come back in, and I went down to Fort Myer(ph) and said, can I come back in? And they said, of course. And I \u2014 I came \u2014 I-I was reassigned on the non-pay unit. We met once every two weeks in the Pentagon for a couple of hours, get a lecture from somebody or gave a lecture. And that was it, we got points, that\u2019s all.

And so I\u2014 I wrote my \u2014 my whole history up to that point. There isn\u2019t much after that anyway, they know me since then. And I made copies and they all have a copy of it.
