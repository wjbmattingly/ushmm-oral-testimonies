A: Well, a-aside from it being Jewish tradition to be named after a dead relative, I
hope that I live up to what I -- the stories that I’ve heard about them.
Q: Give us an example.
A: My mother’s mother was a woman of great breeding and taste and refinement
and culture, very family oriented. Very much 1n love with life and society and busy
with philanthropic interests and family affairs.
Q: I know, of course, that memory goes only back so far, but it would be nice if we
could go back into your earlier childhood and gets a sense of what -- what family
life was, what -- what do you remember about your parents. So my first question
would be, give our listeners who don’t know your parents a sense of who they were.
Your father -- who did you see o-of -- ho-how did you see your father when you
were younger, and how did you see your mother?
A: Well, my mother stayed at home, so I saw a lot more of her than my father, who
worked very hard. My father, I always knew had family. I never met anyone of my
mother’s family until I was eight years old and we met an aunt through marriage in
Germany. I know that my mother took me abroad when I was, I believe one year
old, but of course I don’t remember having met her then. But I never knew family
from my mother’s side, which was a tremendous loss th-that I felt as a child. I knew
that there was a huge, huge part of childhood experience, having grandparents and

aunts and uncles and cousins missing from my life. I was very keenly, keenly aware
of it.
Q: Did you -- let’s -- be-before -- well, let’s -- let’s follow up on this then, before I
ask you again a little bit more about the personas of the -- the persons that your
parents were. Ho-How did -- how -- did you -- how did you ask them about it? Did
you ask your mother, how come I don’t have grandparents? How -- how did this
evolve?
A: My father came before the war, so his experience was growing up in America
from late teenage-hood on, here, as his brothers and sisters, who had been farmed
out from Germany before the war. And they all had international experiences,
some went to South America, some went to Palestine, some -- I mean, every
brother and sister was sent to a different relative around the world. His parents both
died before I got to know them, his mother outlived his father, and was alive when I
was born, but also died when I was quite young. My mother’s side of the family
only came through me -- to me verbally, because there were no -- no pictorial
histories or scrapbooks, or mementos handed down. So it was only her stories and
my imagination that gave them any kind of reality.
Q: How would she talk about them?

A: She talked about holidays that she remembered when she was growing up, what
her family life was like. The talents of the various people. The intellectual
capabilities, the accomplishments. Her family was very accomplished in many
different fields. Sh -- and I think that’s why she had great hopes that I would be a
pianist like one of her cousins who was world renowned. That didn’t do t -- I didn’t
do too well there. Maybe a dancer. The Russian -- the Russian ballet instructor told
my mother, save your money. So th -- so -- so there were -- there were quite a few
talents that I did not pick up from her fa -- family side, but reading and education
were certainly something that she impressed upon me and I developed my own
curiosity in pursuing.
Q: Do you remember the circumstance of when you sort of first became aware of
your mother’s experience during the war, when you realized she was a Holocaust
survivor, although at that time you would not have thought about it in those terms,
probably.
A: No, the dawning was gradual, but the visual indicator was always there. My
mother was always physically very different than other mothers. Her physical
disabilities worsened as I grew up, and it was because her condition was becoming
much more visible and apparent to the outside world that then I came to understand

that she had been born perfectly normal, but because of the beatings that she
received in the camp, it was the cause of these physical abnormalities worsening.
Q: How did -- how did you learn about that, though? Did you ask her questions, or
did she under certain condi -- circumstances talk about that? Ho-How did you learn
about it?
A: There was never a special day that I remember, that was set aside to say this 1s
what happened to me. It was, I think, always part of my consciousness. I think -- I
remember one thing, one day I remembered seeing one of my friend’s parents who
had a number on their arm, and I asked my mother why she didn’t have a number
on her arm. So I knew that there was a commonality of experience that my friend’s
parents had been in camps, and my mother had been in camp, but there was a
difference. And I think that started the storytelling a bit more.
Q: Did you have -- you just mentioned your friends. Did you have Jewish friends
and non-Jewish friends, or pretty much Jewish friends and were there si -- children
of -- of survivors, other children of survivors among them too?
A: The area that I grew up in in the Bronx was a terrific mix of Jewish, Italian, Irish
and in high school, black. But for th -- my earliest school experiences, I would say
95 percent of my classmates -- at that time New York used to place you in a class
of your ability, so the classes were numbered one, two, three, four, so if you were in

the first grade in the first class, that means that you were the most academically
superior. So always being in that first class, it seemed that the make-up was 95
percent Jewish at that time.
Q: Did you talk -- did you have close friends, like really very close friends?
A: I still have them to this day.
Q: Oh, you do?
A: Yeah.
Q: Did -- did you talk to them -- were they children of Holocaust survivors too, by
any chance?
A: The three friends that I have from when I was 10 years old were all American
born and their parents were American born, so no, they -- they didn’t experience the
particular childhood that I did. But I had other friends in the second circle of my --
of my associates that had Holocaust survivor parents.
Q: And did you talk to your friends about it, and to your best friends about -- about
that in some way, did you feel that you wanted to? Did they ask? They probably got

me about her mother’s nightmares, and we were very protective of each other. It
was almost a different circle of friends, the immigrant kids, then the other Jewish
kids who really didn’t have any way of relating to what it was like to have to be a
nurturing support to your elder parent. It was -- it was a role reversal even at a
younger age that some of my friends had. My mother at that point was stronger than
some of my friend’s parents, who were much more emotionally crippled at that
stage, at that stage. My mother was stronger, but the years have taken their toll.
Q: Let’s stay in the earlier years a little bit. What do you remember from your
family life’? What di -- what did you do? What was the relationship between you
and your parents?
A: I was an only child. I was told very early on that my mother had lost all her
family, and when the doctors told her that she was not supposed to have a child, that
her response was that she didn't survive the war not to have a child. So no matter
what the physical cost was going to be -- which put a little guilt on me because I
knew that she was taking a risk and did damage her condition further by bearing
me, but that she felt that she lived for a purpose and the purpose was to have a
family, and that was me, but there was only just me. So I didn’t have any brothers
and sisters. I didn’t have any grandparents or cousins, or people from her side that
she could relate to.

Q: When you look back, what kind of a child do you think you were? How do you
see yourself as a -- as a -- as a younger child? I don’t want to lead you, just how did
you see yourself?
A: My mother will probably say that I was spoiled, and I don’t think so. My -- I was
-- | was -- I will admit that my parents were extraordinarily generous of their time
and the amount of input that they put into my cultural awareness. I grew up in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, I tell everybody that I did. I -- I spent more time
going to botanical gardens and zoos and Radio City Music Hall, and shows when I
was young. And I turned around and did the same thing for my daughter because
my -- my life -- my childhood was so full of extraordinary outings, that I couldn’t
wait to turn around and do that when I had a child, so I -- my -- my social activities
with my parents were extraordinary. Maybe that was to make up for lack of family
affairs.
Q: I take it from your -- from what you just said, that you did not experience that
necessarily as -- as a pressure, but more as an opportunity, or was it also sometimes
a -- a -- a pressure behind this to -- to -- having to fulfill certain expectations?
A: No, I wasn’t -- I wasn’t exposed to these things necessarily to have them
drummed into my psyche that this 1s what you must know in order to be a cultured
person. Everything was on an equal basis. Going to the movies, or seeing the

Rockettes was on the same level as going to a ballet. So everything was done with a
sense of -- of fun and a special occasion, and dressing up and going downtown to
Manhattan. So it was -- it -- 1t was never an expectation that I would be able to
then recite to impress anybody what I had been exposed to. It was just something
that would cu -- just culturally open me up to the rest of the world, outside of New
York.
Q: When you went to the -- to the homes of your friends, did you perceive
differences? Was your upbringing a different one? And if so in what -- in what
way?
A: L always believed my parents to be much more strict than my mu -- than my
friend’s parents who were American born. And we’re talking about my Jewish
friends. Some of their parent were the -- brought up in the 40’s here, very liberal,
virtually leaning on the Communist way, so that they were allowed to stay out late
and make decisions for themselves when my parents said, we have to know where
you are and who you’re with and what time you’re going to come back, and so I felt
that there was much stronger bungee cords on my freedom than my par -- than my -
- my peers experienced. Now that I’m a parent, I don’t know whether it wasn’t a
good idea, cause I probably mimicked more than I -- than I want to admit. But no,

And ma -- and my friends respected and still respect my parents for doing that.
Q: Are your parents very different from each other? Are they -- how -- do you see
them very differently?
A: Entirely differently.
Q: Describe the --
A: Entirely differently. My mother is the intellectual. My father 1s the very
easygoing sense of humor. My mother is very nervous and ferociously protective.
My father was strict, but yet, not as verbal about it as my mother was. But I didn’t
want to cross any lines with my father.
Q: Let’s talk about your education a little bit. You -- what kind of schools did you
go to in the beginning?
A: I went to public schools, New York public schools were wonderful at that time,
and then to, as I said, keep broadening my field of reference, my parents would, on
a very meager income, sacrifice and send me to Swiss schools for the summertime.
I always say that there was a finishing school and th-they finished me off but good.
I’m very polished, highly polished, to a g -- a great gloss.

Q: I detect the irony, of course, but -- but si -- say -- say a little bit more about that.
Was it -- I mean, it was obviously a very different cultural experience
[indecipherable] Europe.
A: Yes, I mean they sent me to -- they sent me to sleep away camps in the United
States and -- when I was younger. Some of them were Jewish, some of them were
not Jewish. My memories of them are that I -- I know that they sent me away from
the city so I didn't have to bear the city heat. My -- before I was sent away to camp,
we always went away -- my mother and I went to the Catskills, and my father
would come up weekends, just like the other fathers would come up and visit, so
that my summers were very pleasant. But then when I became of an age where there
-- they wanted to also have some kind of growing experience, or benefit to be
derived from a summer away, that’s when they looked into these schools in
Switzerland for me, and I went to the same one for two summers in a row.
Q: Did you thi -- when you were in -- how old were you when you were in
Switzerland, roughly?
A: I believe 14 and 15.
Q: Did that subject matter ever come up, being in Europe? I mean, Switzerland
was neutral at the time, but sort of the Holocaust, did that ever come up?

A: The ho -- interesting, you know, the Holocaust itself did not. There were some
Jewish children who came from very nouveau riche families in New York, and
there were Arab children there as well whose -- the younger ones were being trained
to hate anyone Jewish. The older ones my own age were a bit more tolerant. This 1s
-- you -- you know where -- this was close to when Israel had been founded, so
there was some leniency and understanding with the children my own age, but the
younger ones were already being disciplined to avoid us, and they called us -- they
called me the enemy. I re -- I remember that distinctly, that the younger wa --
younger ones would come up to the table when I was sitting with friends and they
would say, how could you sit with the enemy? So it wasn’t the Holocaust, but it was
being Jewish.
Q: Do you think it was difficult for your mother to let you go?
A: ’m -- I’m sure -- I’m sure fo -- for any mother of a single child, it’s difficult to
let a child go, but you g -- you get tremendous satisfaction from seeing your child
come back glowing with the experience. If they’ve had an unhappy experience, of
course you carry that guilt with you also. But what could be terrible about spending
the summer in Europe? So I had -- I had fabulous times, and it -- 1t certainly made
a seed germinate that I wanted to study in Europe later on, which I did in
university.

Q: Let’s stick with being a teenager a little bit. You sort of came of age in a kind of
an interesting time. I mean, the 60’s were rolling around. What -- what had impact?
I mean, there was so much happening at that time, what -- what -- what had an
impact on you? What kind of music did you like? How were you as a teenager?
A: I was a very -- I was a very typical teenager. I was as crazy about the Beatles as
everybody else in America. Some of my American second generation friends were
experimenting with drugs, and this is where the strictness factor came in with my
parents, they -- they practically used to sniff out the backpacks of my friends when
they came in, were very, very protective about what was coming into the house, and
-- and what was be -- what activities were being engaged outside of the house. So I
was not as brave, or as adventurous as some of my American friends because I
didn’t want to upset my parents.
Q: In terms of social movements, was there anything that kind of had an impact on
you, that sort of was important to you?
A: I wanted to belong. As an only child, I always wanted to belong. And when I
started university, I thought I would pledge a sorority. And at the same time, at --
literally, simultaneously, at the time that I was going to be sworn in a secret
ceremony into the sorority, there was a huge anti-war protest on my campus. And it
was one of those lifetime awakening moments, and I said, you know what, what I’m

doing right now is ridiculous. What’s happening outside is much more important,
and I walked away from the sorority and I joined the anti-war movement.
Q: What did you do for them, or with them?
A: I -- I joined the student protests. I worked for Eugene McCarthy. I worked for
Bobby Kennedy on -- especially when he was shot, I started my own initiative for
gun control and I -- and I took ar-around a petition for signatures and then sent it to
Washington. That’s when I started becoming politically engaged. I was just on the
young end of being more radically involved in the anti-war movement. I was, but I
certainly wasn’t the leader, I was more of a follower. And then as I became a bit
more informed, I started working within political movements rather than the more
radical ones that were happening on college campuses.
Q: I know of course that things don’t always work on that kind of simplistic, linear,
logical order, but do you think that the experience of your -- that your awareness of
your mother’s past and of the Holocaust and so on, and second World War had kind
of sensitized you in a different way, or is that no -- 1s -- is that not -- set apart from
it?
A: The -- the Vietnam war was affecting my friends, and I didn't see it as a
corollary to World War II. I mean, yes, if you want to take war is a bad thing in

general, but that was really so subliminal. It was -- it was affecting my friends, my
friends were having to go through the draft. So it was a close, personal fear.
Q: Okay, let’s talk about your education a little bit more. So what did you study,
and when -- we have to -- I -- I want to get a few figures in there, so that we don’t
get totally lost in -- in -- in where we are. You -- you went to college?
A: I went to college and then I went to graduate school as well, and I got my
graduate degree in English, I specialized in Shakespeare.
Q: When was that?
A: Not very commercial. Not very marketable. Let’s see, I graduated very early, I
skipped a grade in junior high school, I entered college at 16, which is very early, I
graduated when I was 20. That -- that is very young, that is very young. I wouldn’t
encourage many people to do that.
Q: Why not?
A: There were some things that I missed. I was -- I was rushing through school so
much that when I graduated early, I didn’t get to attend the graduation ceremonies
with my friends because I was already at the next level. So when I graduated high
school in January and was in college, I didn’t go back in June for my high school
graduation. When I graduated college in January, I didn't go back in June for my

they had. American college at that time was extraordinarily different than English

university where they make you specialize in one field. They will pay for your
education in a field that you have demonstrated talent in. When I was in school in
the States, they make you take two years of every kind of course under the sun, it’s
like a smorgasbord, so that you become out -- well, more rounded, rather than have
a very gr -- huge grasp of one field in particular. And then I did my Master’s in
England at the Shakespeare Institute.
Q: Culturally, did you feel that you were -- that you fit in, or did you feel very
different, or what was the -- sort of the situation, how did --
A: ’ma hypocrite. I married an Englishman, but the English students in general -- I
got out -- I got along with them, and I -- an I -- and I’m an anglophile, I consider
myself an anglophile, but they always kept me a little bit at arm’s length, they

up marrying an Englishman.

A: It certainly didn’t have the emphasis that it has now. I think there’s a -- a -- a gru
-- a greater sensitivity to the teaching of the Holocaust. I think we learned more
about World War II than the Holocaust, now that I think about it. It wasn't as
specifically defined. It was a factor, but 1t wasn’t taught as a major portion of -- it
was just one -- another fact that you learned. You know, there were so many camps,
there were so many killed. The -- the camps were located here and there, and really,

A: I never -- it was a very fine line that I felt that I walked. I never wanted to ask
her things that would bring back very painful memories. I had a visual reminder
every single day of what happened to her. Every time I look at her now, the entire
Holocaust experience is encapsulated in when I look at her. So knowing the
specifics was not as important as grasping the entire experience. And it happened 1-
in the smallest things. When I had to go shopping with my mother and nothing ever

so people don’t have to suffer the type of scoliosis that she has. So when I would
ask her, it really was a familial re-memory -- memory that we would talk about
rather than the brutal beatings. I -- it was hard enough for me to look at her without
having to know exactly how it happened. And -- and -- and it’s still very difficult
for me to imagine someone doing to my mother what had to have happened to her.
Q: And you couldn’t really bear to hear it, right?
A: No, no. I have -- I have a very heightened sensitivity to films, to photographs,
because I don’t have, as I said earlier, any scrapbooks of family pictures. Every face
could be a face of a relative. So there can be -- even though the number of my
mother’s family is finite, when I see pictures of hundreds, they all become related to
me in a sense because anyone of them could have been a true family member. I'll
never know which ones were. It -- on rare occasions my mother has found books
and she has found not Holocaust photographs, but from before the war, photos of
people who were in her family, in very formal, stylized portraits. And I look at them

almost like I look at a picture of Queen Victoria, there’s -- 1t’s such a far relation,
it’s saying my goodness, this is a person who was in my family. It’s -- it’s
extraordinary because there wa -- there was such a stop, there’s such an abrupt halt
in any kind of family continuity because there are no letters or photographs or
visual sightings, or meetings or anything. It’s rela -- it’s trying to relate something
personal to a picture of an entire stranger. So my sensitivity towards Holocaust
materials is -- I f -- I find as I’m getting older, it’s harder and harder for me to -- to
look at the stuff.
Q: How did it make you feel -- how did you feel about the perpetrators? How --
how did you feel at that -- at the earlier time? Did 1t make you angry, sad? What
was sort of the overriding response?
A: To be brutally honest I have tremendous reserves of hate. It’s geared towards the
older generation. I don’t know who 1s innocent and who is guilty, I just know that
guilt by silence is as damning as guilt by participation. In my work on the college
campus with the Jewish student group, we have our Holocaust memorial service
every year, and the Martin Niemoeller poem, when it’s read every single year, is
more and more telling. When they came for the Communists and no one -- and --
and I didn’t say anything, and then they came for me. No one said anything for my
family, no one hid anyone from my family. My family -- my mother’s family was

not lucky. My mother was the only lucky one, and she doesn’t feel lucky in having
survived. She feels guilty because there were so many shining, singular individuals
in her family and she feels that why her, and -- and why did they perish and why did
she survive? So, it’s -- it’s very difficult for me to try, I -- I try to be as open minded
and tolerant as I -- and give the benefit to everyone of a younger generation, but to
my mother’s generation, I don’t want to have anything to do with them. I’m just too
suspicious and too angry.
Q: And does your mother feel the same way, do you think? Did you talk, or did she
ever talk about that?
A: We talk about it sometimes, and I -- I think -- I think I’m -- my mother really
tries to be forgiving, it’s -- it’s getting harder, because when we talk about it when
there is a rise in neo-Nazism in Germany now, what has the country learned? Why
should we be -- be more fo -- mo -- why should we be more forgiving when the
country 1s opening itself up to this type of hatred again? It’s -- it’s too threatening to
be able to say that the country has learned its lesson and it’Il never happen again. It
could. I’m not saying -- I’m not saying a Jewish Holocaust will happen again, but
that kind of -- of rise of that party 1s very disturbing.

Master’s. We both could have done better on our exams if we had stared at the
books instead of into each other’s eyes. I don’t think either of us have any regrets
about either not doing so well on our exams, or -- or getting married, and ge -- or
getting engaged, actually tha -- as quickly as we did.
Q: What was the attraction, apart from the eyes?
A: My husband has an extraordinarily keen mind, and a very dry sense of humor.
And I knew that as loquacious as I am, that I needed someone who would give me
space and listen to me. My mother says, you always married your husband because
he gives you center stage. Which is a very acute assessment. My husband is -- is an
attorney and only really speaks when he needs to. So we are -- we are very opposite,
very, very opposite. I’m very outgoing, he’s much quieter. But when he says
something it’s so incisive, and so intellectually challenging that there are few that
I’ve met that intellectually excite me as much as my husband still does.

A: Yes.
Q: So, how did you negotiate where you would live?
A: I said as long as I was going to get dressed up and be a bride, that I wanted to get
married in New York and have the few distant relatives that I had grown up with
participate in my wedding. And we decided to come to California on our
honeymoon. And wi -- the decision was really very easy, when my husband saw
that it didn’t rain for three weeks straight, he said, why go back. So -- so he came
here before I was finished with my actual dissertation, so we got married and we
were separated for three months in our first year of -- of marriage. So he came here
and petitioned the California bar to be able to take -- take the exam. And I stayed in
England and finished up my dissertation, and then came back and joined him in
California and we’ve been here ever since.
Q: Did you want to have children?
A: Oh yeah, there was never any question. It was only after I had my daughter, and
she was a colic, she scared me off having more. But my husband’s an only child,
and I’m an only child, and I guess we didn’t want to feel outnumbered. So we were

wanted to not spoil her, but certainly expose her to as rich a childhood as I had had.
So we made the decision just to have one.
Q: So that was a conscious decision?
A: It was a very conscious decision. We wanted -- we had always, from when she
was, I think, in her crib, we had always felt that if she was intellectually capable of
going to a wonderful university, that no matter how it -- we -- we would have to
sacrifice, we would send her to the best one that she got into, and she got into Duke
University.
Q: What is her name and when was she born?
A: Her name is Alexis Danielle Rothschild-Sherwin. Alexis is also for Anna --
Hannah, my father’s mother, and Sarah, her -- her -- her -- her Hebrew name is
Hannah Sarah, which is a blending of from my family and my husband’s family
deceased relatives. Alexis comes from Abraham, who is the distant relative who
was partly responsible for bringing my mother over after the war. And he was the
only grandfatherly figure -- he wasn’t a grandfather, obvious, but the only elder
figure that I grew up knowing as a loving relative and so when my daughter was
born I wanted to honor him because he had taken my mother into his family after
the war.

A: I worked very hard at being a mother, and as my child grew and was in school, I
worked very hard in her school s -- because of the pub -- the state of public
education and the lack of funding for the arts. I always took it upon myself to teach
the -- the subjects that they didn’t have money for, so in terms of cultural and -- and
creative enrichment, I would create programs, get grants and then bring them into
the schools. And I did that all through high school.
Q: So education in your family then, is a very important thing too. Education, arts,
culture.
A: Nobody had a choice in the matter. Yes, wh-when given the choice, if -- 1f I -- if
-- if I don’t ask for jewelry, then I always ask to have tickets for a show. It’s -- it’s
the creation of a memory that’s lifelong. O-Other things, cars and clothes and
names on handbags, or things like that, never meant anything to me. E-Even now, 1-

anything else. But going to a show with my family and enjoying that experience,
that’s what we enjoy doing.

a product of American public education. And even though we live in a very upper
class area of Los Angeles where many, many children, even more so now, go to
private schools from the earliest ages on, we decided that we wanted her in the
public school with children from the neighborhood. And that’s why I worked so
hard to try and make the schools have as well rounded an approach to the education
that the funds would allow. And she went through public high sch -- public
education all the way through high school. And then when she got into Duke

seemed to be -- she was in awe of other kids, and I remember feeling, in my school,
that I wasn't the top student, so that the expectations were always that these are the
top students, and I know where I belong in the pecking order. I didn’t want her to
face that same kind of glass ceiling. So we made a choice to send her to this brand
new public sc -- high school, where there wouldn’t be any expectations and there
wouldn’t be any reputations that she would have to face or undo. She was allowed
to reinvent herself. And she metaphysically changed. She became -- immodestly,
she became me. She -- she became political. She became the president of the entire
high school. She -- whatever was going on in that school she became involved in.
She invented the traditions that are now being passed from class to class. She was
allowed to express herself without fear of being pegged as one of the lesser students
trying to work their way up. And so she was one of the golden children at this new
school. That completely made her so confident of herself and her abilities that
there’s no stopping her now. It was a very seminal decision. She hated the traveling
part of it, because it -- 1t entailed being on a school bus for an hour each way every
single day. She -- she didn’t go with her friends from junior high school to the --

school, she was in a class of 120. And they were the first grade that went year by
year through. So she was the first ninth, the first 10", the first 11", the first 12". So

daughter was at Duke University though, she was responsible for bringing my
mother out as a speaker for the Holocaust, and it was very widely attended. And
then my daughter took a Holocaust studies class and had my mother come out and
speak specifically to the class as well as the rest of the university. And I think that

education in this country is going in the right direction? Is there enough of it, too

would be a lessening of -- of ethnic cleansing and wars. Obviously it’s not
achieving its ultimate goal, which is what the survivors, I think, who tell their
stories, would wish. I think the -- their purpose in telling their stories is not only a
testament to their survival, but also as guideposts to the future. So we shouldn’t be

Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
interview with Shelly Sherwin. This is tape number two, side A. Let’s come to sort
of a -- a few issues that are potentially very large, but I would like to leave it up to
you how much you want to respond to it. And the first question is, what kind of role
does your Jewish identity or faith play in your life?
A: I wouldn’t be anything else but Jewish, given a choice. I love being Jewish. I
think being culturally Jewish is a tremendous part of my personality. I don’t know
who I would be, or what I would be like 1f I wasn’t Jewish. I mean, it’s that much a
part of my psyche. And on the other hand, when it comes to pure religion and
observance, I’m more observant than my mother. My husband and I made that
determination when we had our daughter, that we wanted religion to be a spiritual
backbone. Not strict, not strictly enforced, but certainly the spiritual foundation that
it gives someone in terms of an identity. That she would feel as comfortable in her
skin being Jewish as I was, but I had the unique experience of growing up in a very
Jewish community in New York City, so that’s why it’s also interwoven for me.
And my husband grew up in a Jewish area in -- in London. But 1 -- but a -- a New
York Jew is an entity unto itself. What you see on television is what I g -- is what --

school -- it’s interesting, in my parent’s house they did not speak Yiddish. My
mother’s family in Poland did not speak Yiddish because her mother’s side of the
family was Sephardic and that was the -- obviously the s -- the Spanish side, 1t was
not -- it was the Ashkenazic that spoke Yiddish in the house. And I had a summer
job once, working for a doctor in the Catskills, and I picked up a tremendous
amount of Yiddish, because it was with an elderly Jewish clientele, and I brought up
my daughter with these little Yiddish expressions. And she felt so comfortable in
her Jewish skin, that she would routinely use them in her compositions in school,
and sometimes get comments on the t -- on the papers from the teacher saying, I
don’t understand this word. So I encouraged her creativity and said, if that’s the
word that best describes how you’re feeling, then just put a footnote at the bottom
of the page, which is what she started doing in grade school. If -- if a Yiddish word
sufficed, she would use it, and then put a footnote in for those people who didn’t
understand it. And so even when we converse now, it’s not that either of us are
fluent Yiddish speakers, but th -- there are certain expressions that we do use
routinely. So that’s -- that’s where I fit in in terms of being culturally how I identify
myself, and in terms of personality. I cannot split where my Judaism leaves off and
where the rest of me begins. They’re -- they’re inextrictably entwined. Religiously
is a different story. In -- in following the rituals, when my daughter was going to

Hebrew school in preparation for her Bat Mitzvah and my husband and I started a
temple with 18 other couples, it was an extraordinary life changing event to be in on
the -- on the formation of a temple. I -- we never worked as hard, we never sat on as
many committees, we never had so little free time as we did, and yet we look upon
that as the most golden period in our lives because we did something really so
constructive. But when it got down to actually being alone with my thoughts with
God, it’s a love/hate relationship. My mother came out of the camps questioning her
faith. She will tell you now that if she was given a choice she wouldn’t come back
Jewish. My father loves temple and loves being surrounded by things that are
familiar with him, he’s -- he’s -- he’s traditional and a little bit old-fashioned in that
sense, he doesn’t like female cantors. He likes that good old solid, you know, Jan
Pierce type of voice, that -- that brings him to his spiritual satisfaction. When I was
diagnosed with cancer in -- breast cancer in aug -- in July, sorry, in July, I had my
surgery in August, I didn't question why it happened to me, and I wasn’t as angry at
God as I have been about why my mother had to suffer through the Holocaust. I
could accept my fate more easily and hopefully with more grace than I’ve ever been
able to accept what happened to my mother and her family. And so when it -- when
I think in terms of blind faith, I don’t have it. I know that Judaism is built upon
equal parts of blind faith and questioning, so that you come to a -- a soulful

understanding of your relationship in -- in the world, and with God as a Jew. And
yet, the Holocaust puts a -- a huge roadblock that sometimes prevents me from
attaining more spiritual insight. I’ll never be able to get past that. Sometimes I have
a very accusatory tone in my thoughts when my mother is suffering the way that she
does. I never had a normal mother. I never experienced a mother without pain,
without even the unspoken kind of neuroses that the Holocaust caused her to
develop in her personality. She is an intellectually brilliant free spirit, and yet the
Holocaust harnessed her intelligence and imprisoned her in this failing, tortured
body. And so I’ve been very angry at God for a long time.
Q: I meant to ask you what impact did the Holocaust have, or your mother’s
experience, on you. And that, of course, 1s a major answer already, that you just
gave. Is there anything else that you could add to that if you think about, in terms of
different perspectives on something. If you think about that experience, your
mother’s experience on you, on your life, on your outlook on life.
A: I’ve always tried to be the best daughter that I could so that A, I wouldn’t cause
my mother any unhappiness or unnecessary disappointment. Of course, you know,
I’d be superwoman if I never disappointed my mother. But I’ve -- I’ve carried the

It’s a tremendous burden. I feel that I pay for the Holocaust in many ways. Because

of what happened to my mother, I live my life in a way that is encumbered by it,
rather than being free to have experienced a mother who aged gracefully without all
these extra layers of mental and physical pain that were artificially -- s-she was
subjected to. Unnecessarily objected to -- subjected to. It’s -- it’s -- it’s a -- I feel
that -- I can’t say it any more strongly, I feel that I am paying for the Holocaust
every single day.
Q: Fr-From your perspective, is your mother paying for the Holocaust every single
day? Is she, however reluctant a little bit to -- to make too much of that in -- in -- in
her public presentations and interviews, maybe? Do you see -- how do you see that?
A: For posterity, I will tell you, and I hope my mother will not hear this because it
would bring her pain. My mother will not admit to the world at large -- terrible --
terrible an -- analogy, but what a -- what an overwhelming cross she’s had to carry
every day, every step, every time she puts on her iron brace in the morning, it’s the
Holocaust coming back into her life again. Her coping system -- if -- if one of us
has a cold, or the flu, or anything normal, it’s magnified 10 times because nothing 1s
allowed to happen to her family any more, because everything happened to her
family before. So h -- there’s no sense of normal perspective or proportion in what
goes on in our lives. The joys are -- are tremendous, wonderful, sweet joys. What
could be just a minor disappointment, because her life 1s so limited now by her

physical limitations becomes magnified 10 times more, because sh -- because she
doesn’t have the outlets that a physical life would allow her. And she has nothing
left but this interior life. Everything is magnified.
Q: How -- how does your father fit into all of this?
A: My father doesn’t have the -- the -- there’s a -- there’s a more laissez faire
quality to my father’s life. Things happen, and he can accept them. And my mother
will feel more the injustice, or -- or -- or more protective, or -- I think that she feels
that she paid with her family so dearly, that we should be spared. And my father
understands that nobody -- in -- in the normal run of life is spared from everything,
and yet it -- it become so taxing. I mean, when I was diagnosed with this, I was m --
we -- we carefully orchestrated an entire scenario around telling my mother that I’d
been diagnosed with cancer. I was more concerned telling my mother -- even
though it was in the earliest stages, that 1t was entirely curable, that it was not going
to affect my quality of life, I was more distraught in having to tell my mother, and
that was one of the only times that I broke down. It was up to my husband and my
daughter and my doctors, who are friends, who sat and told my mother. I was out of
the house. I couldn’t physically be in the house because I thought I’m bringing her
more pain than she needs. And I felt guilty. The cancer didn’t bother me as much as
I knew that it was going to hurt my mother.

Q: Do you want to stop for a moment? We will stop for a moment. So we were just
talking about how difficult it 1s to -- 1-1t was to -- to let your mother know, and so
that she wouldn’t worry too much about your health, but is that also very difficult
for you, not being able to -- do you have to censor a little bit what -- what -- what
you are saying?
A: By nature I’m very spontaneous. My husband is the chess player, my husband 1s
the -- is the bridge player. My mother is an extraordinary bridge player. That all
involves strategy. That always know -- those people have a talent for knowing when
and where to say and do the right thing. I don’t have that particular capacity. So
usually something happens to me and itll come straight through me without a filter
or -- or a censor. It’s not that I’ve tried to learn how to strategically tell my mother
things. It’s just that sometimes now I spare her. And it’s not that I don’t want to be
honest, it’s just that I don’t want to burden her. It’s -- it’s very different. There are
things that she has to know, that sometimes you just can’t sugarcoat. But there are
times when I have wanted to be entirely candid at the moment that things were
happening, and her responses were such that, oh, but I went through something so
much worse. Or but, you know, if you’re daughter is unhappy at this age, where do
you -- what do you think I felt when I was her age? So I can’t be involved in this
kind of one-upsmanship and I can’t compete, no one can compete with her

experiences in the Holocaust. And yet it’s unfair to hold the Holocaust over my
head as preventing me from being entirely open with my mother. So sometimes the
easier route is just not to tell her everything. It’s not that she’s not sympathetic, it’s
just that, look what -- what -- what I went through, this is not a reason to complain.
And yet, everybody -- in everybody’s life there are things that happen on an
everyday basis which are bothersome or annoying, or distressing. And no, they have
no comparison, there is no relevance to the Holocaust. And yet, the Holocaust is
used -- I don’t want to say as a battering ram, but as this stick that we have to
measure our experiences against -- versus hers, and sh -- her -- she tops everything.

Q: Was there any patience then, with the trivial childhood problems that one tends
to have, like with yours? Was -- how did she deal with that, when you were young,

A: She was much stronger when I was younger, the Holocaust didn’t factor in m-
my -- I went only once to a Second Generation meeting, and I felt that it was one of
these group hug type of California groups because someone stood up and said, if I
came home from school with a grade that was less than stellar, my mother would
say, 1s that what I ho -- survived the Holocaust for? And I never experienced that,
my mother never did that to me when I was younger. I mean, if I failed a math test

it was because I was lazy. It had nothing to -- it had no reverberation, or -- or
association to -- you know, you should have done better because of what I went
through. And I didn’t want to have to live through these other people’s nightmares
of what they went through with their parents, because I thought it would -- because
my childhood had been so happy. My mother was stronger when she was younger.
It’s now that she’s older and becoming more fragile on so many different levels that
the Holocaust is becoming a factor in daily life and conversation when we talk
about normal experiences. But when I was younger, it just -- it wasn’t used as a
motivation that some of these people had as their parents. And my mother didn’t
have, or didn’t use me as a buffer in real life when I was younger. Some of these
people also say that their parents would wake up with nightmares and they would
have to comfort their parents, kind of almost like children of alcoholics that have to
parent their -- their parents. And I didn't have that experience. I had wa --
considering what my mother went through, I think I had an extraordinarily normal
childhood, and it’s just changed in the last couple years.
Q: Why did you go to Second Generation in the first place, was that -- was there, in
spite of the experience afterward, sort of a genuine need to maybe compare
experiences, or to even get advice, or to exchange experiences, or were you
prompted by somebody, or was it a -- a curiosity thing?

A: M-My mother had heard about it and she wanted to -- wanted me to go and see
what it was all about. Because my background, my childhood was so normal, I
mean, you know, there aren’t normal childhood groups. Nobody goes and seeks out
a normal childhood group, so I -- I didn’t think that there was any particular reason
driving me to go to a Second Generation group, be -- be -- because I -- and -- and I -
- it was borne out, my speculation that these kids didn’t have a normal childhood,
and so they did need a -- a support group, where they could share what they went
through. I probably need it now more than I did years -- then. But I’m more
concerned with dealing -- being a mother of a 22 year old, and being a mother to my
mother who 1s 70 plus. So I’m in the middle right now, and don’t particularly feel
that I have the time or the -- or the emotional energy to go to one of those groups
right now. And plus I’m -- plus dealing with the recovery from my surgery is pretty
time consuming.
Q: Did you ever want to go to -- did you ever go to Poland?
A: No. And it’s not that I didn’t want to. My husband’s a stick in the mud, and we
didn’t leave the country until our 25" anniversary when we went to visit our
daughter in Italy. But he’s always had this ext -- extraordinarily heavy workload
that we just didn't do any international travel and now after this -- this brush with

the hint of mortality, we’ve made a promise that we will travel more extensively. So
I don’t know if Poland is my first destination, but who knows?
Q: What is your relationship to Israel’? Have you ever been there?
A: I -- I was there when I was 19. And I’m -- I’m the one who 1s responsible for
sending, not all of them, but many, many students on an international program
that’s free for 10 days to Israel, that’s an extraordinary experience. So I’m reliving
the wonder of my ninet -- when I was 19 and went there and -- and having the
privilege of sending these young people there. Israel was part of that education that
my parents gave me when I was younger. I did it in a summer when I went to visit
friends who I’d made in high school, from Switzerland, and they lived in Istanbul.
And they said, if you’re coming to Israel, then you better stop in Turkey cause
otherwise you never will, and they were right, I’d never -- I never went back and so
I got to see Turkey, I stayed with them for three weeks and then I went to Israel for
three weeks.
Q: I seem to recall that your mother said that your daughter has a very special
relationship to Israel. Has she been there many times? Or do I recall it wrong?
A: No, no, she was there on the very first trip, this exa -- this hello Israel birthright
trip that I’m talking about, she was selected to go from Duke University on their
inaugural trip, it was over the millennium. And you do everything from

archaeological digs to climbing Masada at dawn, to camel rides and Bedouin
dinners, to floating in the Dead Sea, to meeting with Palestinian leaders. It’s a very
cerebral and spiritual experience. There is no emphasis placed on religion itself, it’s
just that the reasoning behind this trip, there are three multibillionaires who are
underwriting the cost of sending 50,000 students internationally to Israel free for 10
days. And they just felt that this generation didn’t have the bond with Israel that my
generation and my parent’s generation had. So they’re trying, in hopes to foster this
type of link with Israel, and it’s working.
Q: What kind of relationship does your husband have to your parents? Or -- and to
your mother?
A: Well, my mother wishes that my husband would speak more. But after 27 years
of marriage she should know better. The -- if you don’t ask my husband something
in question form, you’re not going to get an answer. But my hu -- I think my
husband 1s a wonderful son-in-law. He cares deeply about my mother’s welfare,
both mentally and -- and physically, and 1s very solicitous of her. And for as
emotional as an Englishman can be, he tries, he tries really hard. He’s -- the greatest
thing that my husband ever did was introduce my mother to the computer.

March 15, 2001
Q: Oh, I have to talk to her about that. Is there anything else that you would like to
say to -- to round this out that I haven’t asked, or that -- that came up in the process
that you would like to sort of say?
A: I hope a Holocaust never happens again, not only for the people who are directly
involved, but for their descendants. There is such a lingering affect of this kind of
devastation. It manifests on so many different levels. It affects the way people react
to each other. I wish that lessons could be learned from the Holocaust. I wish that
people who are in my position could also affect a change, but sometimes you’re so
busy dealing with the victims, that you don’t have time to take care of the rest of the
world. I try on a small basis to interact with my peers on an international basis. And
yet, I would be less than human and less than my mother’s daughter if I didn’t say
that her experience has shaped my world view. I try -- I try on a daily basis to be a
better person. Sometimes I succeed and sometimes I’m not as forgiving as the ideal.
Q: Okay, well, thank you very much for the interview. This is the end of tape two,

which is the Jewish student group, and create a program of activities, everything
from virtual bowling to having intellectual, philosophical, ridiculous conversations.
Activit -- all kinds of activities. These are college students and they’re looking to
have fun and they’re looking to bond with their peers, and so I’ve been doing that
for 10 years. And --
Q: You like teaching?
A: I like being the boss. And the other thing that keeps me very busy, because I do
love writing, I -- and I’ve -- I’ve free-lanced on a book, and I just enjoy the process
of writing, is that I have a business with a partner for college admissions, we’re
college counselors. And I work both with high school students and then college
graduates on their admission application essays. We help them from the entire
creative process of formulating their ideas to the finished product of the essays. So
it’s a very creative and involving and sometimes nerve-wracking process, waiting
for those acceptance letters to come. But it -- it keeps me very involved with
students from high school age through graduate school students.
Q: So of course now I have one very last question. What are your hobbies, what do
you do for fun when you have time to have fun?
A: Let’s see, does -- does eating chocolate count as a hobby?

A: Okay.
Q: No, it doesn’t actually, but -- that’s a preference, that’s a fun thing.
A: Okay, well theater certainly 1s a priority. Since we had the chance to travel two
years ago to Italy when my daughter was doing a study abroad, that re-sparked my
wanderlust, which I had before I married my husband, and he has promised that he
will take off some time and we’re going to go back to Europe again. Museum trips
are still a -- a very constant feature of life here in Los Angeles. Reading, I’m a great
reader, I always have. Music, I -- I keep a little bit of my youth in my tastes with --
still listening to the Beatles, but I find that classical music is more satisfying now as
I’m getting older, especially driving in LA traffic. And love my dog.
