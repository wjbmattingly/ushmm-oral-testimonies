He was the strongest man, if somebody wanted to give an example he strong, so they said he\u2019s as strong as Leibush.

And also when Jews never stood up against anything what was done to them, Leibush was one, he wouldn\u2019t take abuse. And there was one I write in the other book, once there was a draft commission, you know a draft commission came to our town to take the boys who had to go to draft, so they came a few high Polish officers and a military doctor, and they conducted the draft. So once when Jews had to go to to the bigger town, they went by wagon, they went by autobus. The autobus went once a day, eight in the morning to so when the Jewish people, some Jewish people wanted to go on the autobus, so those officers were standing by the door, they didn\u2019t let in Jews and Leibush --. I can, stop it......where were we?"

            "question": "We were talking a little bit about Leibush.",
            "answer": "Okay, he had the store. I started to tell you about-----so those two officers, the three officers were standing in the doorway they didn\u2019t let in nobody, no Jews because they wanted to go to the big town. And there came also was standing a young woman and she had a sheitl a wig, because they were very religious, so when she wanted to go in they grabbed her by the hair and they pulled down the wig, she was very embarrassed because they were shamed. When my brother saw that they don\u2019t let her in, they pulled off the wig, and he was this time, I would say about twenty years old, or twenty-one years old. But he went and he wanted to go and he pushed the officer, and it was a high officer, he pushed him so fast, he was standing there, that he fell on the other one and the other one, they all, three or four, they all fell down. And naturally he was afraid, so he run away, then the police came and they arrested my brother and there was a big case and they took about four, five years. This was taken to J toa superior court and they made a big issue because who would touch a Polish officer? The main thing, after he knocked them down all the Jews went in that car, but they had my brother arrested. But the main thing was that they asked the woman to be a witness who was pulled down the wig, and she didn\u2019t want to be a witness, she was afraid. But then later we had to hire big lawyers and it cost money and this was, but he was known about his strength. When he was younger, I was a very poor eater so my mother used to say \u201cI never had trouble with Leibush, because Leibush, when put down for breakfast a bread, he finished the whole bread. He finished the whole loaf.\u201d So they ask Leibush, they ask him, \u201cWhen do you know that you have enough?\u201d He was not fat, when do you know it\u2019s enough?\u201d So he said, he never said when he\u2019s full or something, {when the muscles} not the muscles, how you call this?"

            "answer": "The jaw. When the jaw starts to hurt you, then he knows he has enough. And there were other cases that, the peasant people they always wanted to show off their strength and there was one, he was known as strong. So he came over once and said \u201cLet\u2019s wrestle.\u201d My brother said I don\u2019t want to wrestle, I\u2019m not a wrestler. He said \u201cLet\u2019s wrestle.\u2019 He wanted to show he is stronger, so my brother didn\u2019t want to bother, and later he bothered him and he said \u201cOkay, let\u2019s wrestle.\u201d So they took off their jacket, the other guy took off his jacket. It took a second, the other one was stretched out. So then he said that he approved he\u2019s the strongest. And then he was with me in the woods after a year and we escaped from the camp. But in the end he died of a heart attack, actually he had cancer in his mouth and then they gave him so much cortisone that, awful big dose, that he went for a visit to Israel and while he was on the visit to Israel he died and the dead was a heart attack, but this was caused by the cortisone. So this is about Leibush. Now, about Shulim, now you have written down here, I don\u2019t know, you have the record....."

He didn\u2019t have no Jewish schools, this was public schools and Jews couldn\u2019t attend public schools anymore, not that the Jewish schools were shut down. And he cannot walk on the sidewalks, this was not right in the beginning, Jews could walk on the sidewalks, but this was not the main thing because he is a Jew. But he doesn\u2019t understand what lies behind these rules because I think the whole thing is, he couldn\u2019t go to school because Jewish schools were shut down; all schools were shut down. In 1944 Shulim turned twelve in 1942 the Germans were, we can say we were at this time in the ghetto in Kolbuszowa."

It was arranged by the Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and grab people from the streets, their houses, so it was arranged how many was in the work force from the ghetto, so everybody got a card that this and this day he has to report to work. They worked, they sent them out, since he became 12, he worked, came out two or three times a week to go to work, in the winter mostly by snow and the summer on the roads and other things. And we lived together because in the ghetto we moved in the apartment where Leibush lived; so happens that this apartment was in the place where the part of the ghetto was at. And we got the room and we worked together, we lived together. He wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t so bad because my brother he was a member of the Judenrat, the first Judenrat and he was selected by the about which we will talk later and then later he was arrested but, in the book it\u2019s written how he was released because only three Jews were released from jail, the rest were killed, the whole Judenrat. Leibush\u2019s father is still in the ghetto, he had his store because this was the place that he was not thrown out. So, how much he could buy and market things and this way he was not bad off in the ghetto. They had enough, everything. Until it was the transport to J and J to Belges and then they were killed."

So we had the kitchen, and he with his three children had the bedroom, so we lived together what we used the same kitchen and they had this one room. But he also had, in the basement, he had the store still, there was not too much merchandise, but how much he could buy from black marketeeers, so he had, and he was busy in the store."

Like for us, they threw us out from our house and to go into the ghetto, but he was there, so we came to live with him. Now, if we wouldn\u2019t live from him there would be other people, but this way when we took it over, so nobody else came in the house. But the main thing is from Shulim, also here you have written down 1945, Shulim was born the same year as Richard, my older brother\u2019s son, but Richard was born in America. My brother had moved there after a pogrom in our town in 1919. I always think of these two, Richard now a doctor in America, Shulim killed in Poland at 13, not 13 but 12. See the people are so stupid, they know by he was born in 1930 and he was killed in 1942, but here they mark down 13. So he was born when he was 12 years old. So this, I think, this is a very nice sentence, that to compare those two, Richard now a doctor in America and Shulim killed in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

It\u2019s also, certain things is not correct also. Somebody who wrote it didn\u2019t know. Well, anyway he, said he never bothered with Jewish causes when the first time when they threw out the Jews from Germany in this was the first time that he came. They organized a committee in every little town to help the German Jews who were thrown out and we organized in Kolbuszowa also and this is the first time he took part for it. And I remember the first time that he attended shul when he spoke about giving money to this organization to help. The second time I remember he came to shul to speak that when before the war started and the Polish government saw that there have to be a war, so they wanted the citizens should donate money to buy airplanes because the Polish air force didn\u2019t have too many airplanes; they had a few. So, they collected money so I remember he, this is the second time he came to shul, he spoke to the Jews, naturally he spoke Polish. Spoke to the Jews willing to give money, and I remember his words, he said, \u201cToday we beg you to give the money, but in a few months, I am afraid they will take it without.\u201d He meant the Germans, they would take it without begging you, without asking you. He asked the people for money, and then this was the first two times, when the war started he was drafted as a reservist, as a doctor to the army. He was taken to a prisoners\u2019 camp in an officers\u2019 prisoner of war camp. And then later he was released, short after he was released and see, in this book was written exactly where he was interned."

And then he was taken as a prisoner of war, and he came back to Kolbuszowa he started to run his office.

He was not a very person, this..... he started to tell them which Jews have hidden merchandise, as a matter of fact my father suffered very much from this Jew. Like he came to my -- the Germans liked coffee, coffee beans. He came to my -- and we had coffee beans hidden so he came every day for coffee beans. Today he wanted two kilo, the next day three kilo and then four kilo....and then my father told him how much can I give you, I mean we don\u2019t have new shipments. He said to him a well, if you take so much water out it will be dry. So he said well if you don\u2019t want to give more I will take it, so he went to the Germans and he squealed that my father has hidden merchandise. They came over and they took away everything we had. I remember it was three days that they went and loaded everything we had because he squealed."

            "answer": "Everything, they took everything, they took even personal things, everything because they said that he ---. They took away everything, we had a lot of merchandise because this merchandise could be sold and we could have money, but they took away everything. My father ran away, and then because he was afraid that they will arrest him, I run away and this time I run away to Russia, which later I came back. And he, and this man wanted to become the president because the Germans said you have to organize a Jewish council, but the Jews knew if he would become council, it would be very bad for the Jews because he was, like I said. Before the war everybody knew somebody wanted to have a witness in court, if there was a court case and they needed a witness, he would always be a witness for money, naturally. So even there was here in America there are sayings if I speak to some people from Kolbuszowa and I ask them something and they don\u2019t want to tell me a lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and this? I don\u2019t want to mention his name because he has his family. So they say, what do you think I am him? He was known that he is \u2014 for money he can be a witness. So then we Jews knew that if he would become the president it would be bad for Jews because he would collaborate with the Germans. So the Jews started to speak to prominent Polish Catholics, especially to the mayor, who we told him that we are very concerned that he would become the president, not only this, because if he will be president he will pick out members, his friends, his like, and then it will be bad. We the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only one who could actually be stronger than him is Dr. Anderman, he didn\u2019t look Jewish, I mean he didn\u2019t have a beard, most of the Jews had beards and he spoke beautiful German because he started in Vienna and he was a proud man and he would never -- he would be able to protect the Jews. A group of Jewish people went to him and they said to him he should become so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor. I don\u2019t want to be a politician, and I don\u2019t want to have a job like this. The Jews begged him, they told him, look if you don\u2019t do it, you are the only one, can protect us from this man and he knew that this man is no good for the Jews. Well, anyway, after a few times. I remember my father went to him and others, he said all right, I will do it against my judgment, I will do it, only on one condition. If I will -- he had to pick out ten or twelve members of the council, -- only if I can pick out the people I want. So, he made the list and he picked out mostly younger people, mostly people without beards, and that shouldn\u2019t be, again, the Germans shouldn\u2019t dislike them and also, people who were in the Jewish community leaders before the war. They were people, respected citizens, and people who were quite well off and he picked out this Jewish council which included my brother Leibush, and my brother-in-law Sh , well younger people. He organized the Jewish council which was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans used to grab people from the streets from their houses for work. He organized and made lists, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

In the middle of \u201940, even earlier, I would say in spring of \u201940, spring40, yeah. And then he ran the Judenrat and it was run very -- he was very just, and if they had to take money because they needed for certain things, he always took it from people that had money. If you want a few details you read the book about this chapter, you\u2019Il see he was a very fair man, and I liked him very much. Later he opened an ambulatorium, a free clinic because he was a doctor and he knew a lot of people don\u2019t have money, so my sister and the brother-in-law who was also a member of the Judenrat, had the empty store because he was in the flower business, and in the war they didn\u2019t have flower, so he opened in his store the ambulatori1um. He was there two or three times a week in the afternoon, and everybody who was sick, especially the poorer people came there and he treated them without fee. He needed help so he asked me with other friend of mine, and he became -- we worked and he started to teach me how to dress wounds and how to clean boils and all these things and I was very good as I always wanted to be a doctor, I was very good at it. I went there and for this, because I was with him, this work released me from going to work on the roads or something and I worked with him for over a year in this ambulatorium."

Then also he gave me a job, before the war I was the buyer for my father\u2019s store and I used to go to different towns. They needed somebody to bring in the flour and other food what Germans gave on carts to the Jews, and this had to be, we had to bring it from Jeshup, from other towns. Also we had to buy a lot of stuff from the black market, like potatoes, they didn\u2019t give us enough, other things that we needed we opened a public kitchen, a soup kitchen in -- he organized a soup kitchen. The kitchen needed certain things that the Germans didn\u2019t give us, so I -- they picked me up and I went out twice a week to different towns. I got a pass and I could go out and I could travel, and I brought in all those things that the Jewish community got officially from the Germans. By going out and having this pass, I also could buy a lot of black market for the Jewish -- for the soup kitchen we needed, and also I bought on the black market for myself, for my family. I brought in stuff and they sold it so they could make something out of it, my father. So this was how we worked with Anderman and I became very, very friendly with Anderman and I admired him because he was very fair. There was something, a question about having privileges, the people who were in the Jewish council, they wanted to take advantage, he always was against it. Again in his book, you have the stories about it. Then they organized the ghetto, they organized the ghetto so he was responsible for the Jewish should have where to live.

He said to him, you take, because you are the head of the Judenrat, pick out the best apartment for yourself. Anderman said I will not pick out an apartment until the last Jew has a roof over his head. And if the Jews will be settled, then I will take it. See, he wanted to move in his apartment, then later said to him, I want to move in the apartment but he wanted a Jews should give him 10,000 zloty to renovate the apartment. He said renovate it, it\u2019s just a new house, it\u2019s just a year old.

Everybody said Anderman he\u2019s the father of us and he will try to go out and try to see that they should be released.

He wasn\u2019t there, so they didn\u2019t arrest him. Later though he came back, we paid money, he came back, so there was no Judenrat. Now we were alone so naturally the police started to come in and the police started to make orders but then he said he\u2019s looking for a new head of the Judenrat. While they were sitting in jail, they were also sitting two brothers, their name was Rappaport, Yanchi Rappaport and Pashi Rappaport and they were Jews without beards, they were young, they were educated Jews.

It was a very unusual business for Jews but they were not observant Jews, so this is what they did. Anderman knew -- we knew that Twardon\u2019s looking for a new but he wants to have someone with authority, so even in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection jail, because in jail they lived in one big basement, it was not like a regular jail, but they kept them in the basement from the magistrate building. So Anderman said that if he would ask somebody to become the president of Judenrat everybody should refuse. This way if everyone would refuse and to say that they cannot take care on this only Anderman can. This maybe will force them to let out Anderman. Meanwhile this Rappaport who was there he didn\u2019t listen to him and he told his wife to go to Twardon and tell him that her husband, this Pashik Rappaport is willing to become Judenrat. That he\u2019s young, he\u2019s energetic, he\u2019s good looking and the German would like him, and he speaks good German and they have a business in K . He looked at her, she was a good looking woman and one day the police came and they took out this Pashik and they saw that he --. They take him away to the office where the ___ so right away Jews started to suspect but he said oh nobody will become the ald __. Anyway he spoke to Twardon and he told Twardon he would be a good Judenrat man and he will serve the Germans and all these things and he released him and his brother from jail, and he made the president and his brother the assistant. Once this happened, Anderman said now we have lost everything. We didn\u2019t believe that a Jew would do it but he did and this man started to pick out members of the Judenrat. Naturally he picked out different kinds of people that Anderman wanted. Anderman wanted the best quality and he picked out from the people that they were servant. He was in the cattle business so he took a few people who were in the cattle business and a few black marketers. He made a new Judenrat. Now the new Judenrat started to work and then the Polish population wanted to take away Anderman. Anderman could go out because, as a matter of fact, practically every night he went out to sleep in some Polish house. This was watched, this jail was watched by the municipal police. They knew him so they let him out and the next day before dawn he came back. The Polish people begged him not to go back. Eventually they would do something with those people, they will not keep them forever. He didn\u2019t listen; he said that the Jews cannot take care. I am the one who can speak to the Germans for them; they listen to me. He didn\u2019t run away and then one day they came and they took all of them away to J . They let out only three Jews, they let out, my brother included. If you read the book you will know the reason why. My brother-in-law came back from J. so Twardon said that there are some members of the first Judenrat, they should take them in. They became in the second Judenrat. They were in J about two weeks. After two weeks they took all of them to Auschwitz and this time Auschwitz was not so prominent as later. They took them to Auschwitz and as they took them to Auschwitz, the families start to receive telegrams. They said this one died from cancer, this one died on pneumonia, this one died trying to escape. Let me flip the tape. END OF SIDE A, TAPE 1"

Not the Warsaw uprising but the Jews of the general Warsaw uprising, he was killed in the uprising. His wife survived and after a while she came over here an old broken woman. She died here in America. For Anderman, when he was arrested so the Polish people, even the mayor who was in went to V and told them he should be released if he says the Polish patriot and he is such an honest man. He says this is why we arrested him, he was too honest. I think that this Anderman that what he did for the Jews that he never, never associated with the Jews, that he was an exceptional man. I always say if the Jews would ever have saints like the Catholics have saints, Anderman should have been a saint. Because he could have survived, he had a possibility; he had help from the Polish people, he was considered to be a Polish Catholic. He said ,No, I cannot do it, I have to stay with the Jews because the Germans listen to me and they respect me."

So this Hewlett Johnson who was quote a \u201cRed Dean\u201d because he was very pro communism. He was archbishop. They wanted to know what connections he had with the Polish underground, with all those things. We were sent and officially we were members of the Polish delegation but our mission was completely different. This Hewlett Johnson, the reason they called him the \u201cRed Dean\u201d was because when it was the Korean War, he went to Korea and he wrote how the Americans behaved and what the Americans are doing, very pro-communist. Then later I wanted to go and I went over to one commentator and wanted to tell him how he was misled. How we arranged his meetings with the Polish peasants, with the Polish patriots so that everything was such officially done and everything was lies. That the government did it just to show him. Then later, he said to me, listen they won\u2019t bother you, don\u2019t start because you came over here. They will ask you how you know those things and --. So [I let it go. I went, his last name, his name Barry Gray. He was a very outspoken commentator, I went to him. He said to me, you come over here, you had so much trouble. Don\u2019t go into more trouble. I could find out from Auschwitz in the beginning everything because I was the authority but there were so many things. The war was still going on that this was secondary to --. But I made pictures in Auschwitz, I have the pictures still today. You don\u2019t have all because we didn\u2019t come yet to those pictures. This is -- I made a list, the pictures that I gave you.

But one, an exceptional game , which I want you should put it in, which this 1s very important. The Henoch, he was like the ringleader, was very smart for his age. When he lived before we went to the ghetto, we lived not far from the German police. We knew the German commandants of the police. Everybody knew them. One was good, one was bad, one was worse. There was one man, his names was Harenbeer. Habier is H-a-b-i-e-r. He had a face like very, very like a bulldog. His face was not really a human face and he was very vicious. He killed a lot of people. The children knew about it and their game in ghetto was that this Henoch and Blimcia took together a few other children. Henoch stood in front of them and he spoke to them German because he heard about it. He used to ask them, he had in his hand a piece of wood pretending this is a rifle."

It was also, that we always laughed, that they knew that I am away in another town and I have to come back. Usually I came back on a bicycle; they always used to wait. By Jews there is a saying when you mention Sabbath, you always say Shabot Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath. She heard the Shabot Kordish, there was another expression that when children came to their grandparents or to their aunt, every Saturday they came for Sabbath fruit. They gave them a treat. They used to come in and they used to say Shabbos Optz. Optz means in Jewish, fruit. They used to give to ess Shabbos Optz to get something. When they waited for me to bring something, somebody mentioned oh you waiting for him because he\u2019s going to bring you Shabbos Optz. This girl she remembered something but she didn\u2019t remember exactly so when I came in, so she came to me and she said if I brought her Shabbos Kordish. It means the Holy Sabbath because she didn\u2019t remember the expression. Since then she knew every time I came so both of them wait and they say give me the Shabbos Kordish, it means the Sabbath fruit, the Holy Sabbath. But everything for us, we had something. Naturally they were the first one because we were a very close family and the children from my sisters, were our children, were the same thing.

My mother, naturally took it, 1t was something, she divided it in small pieces and they were the first ones to get it. Later when I came to America so I asked my brother, we got once in ghetto a package from Turkey, did you send it? He said I didn\u2019t send it but there was once an ad in the paper that said when you pay in fifteen dollars, a Turkey company will send to any place in German occupied Europe, a package.

He said why didn\u2019t you send it every day. Yes, he could afford it. Every day, send in $15. He said well I didn\u2019t get a receipt that you received it. I said, how could you get a receipt? We were in the ghetto. But to take a chance, maybe 99% it will get lost but 1% it will come in, why not? So -- it was late. I remember when we got those goodies, my mother divided and every day they came and they got the piece of cheese, they got a piece of salami. We were very, very, very close and naturally the children were everything. For this reason, now I have grandchildren their age. I look at the grandchildren and I see those children and how those children were undressed. The mother had to take them in to a gas chamber. They had to be killed being two and three and a half years old. The mind cannot absorb it. We cannot talk about it because there are no words to talk about it a million and a half children. Those were such beautiful, beautiful children. They didn\u2019t ask nothing from the world, they only wanted to be alive. Naturally they didn\u2019t realize what\u2019s going on. This is how they went. I think that f you will write about them, you\u2019ll put them both together not separate because they were -- they lived together -- they were the same age, they lived in the same house.

This is the one who came to beat up my brother and then later he took him out from jail. Then later -- so he was also there. It was special certain German policemen that they were exceptional vicious. They were known for their viciousness. There were some who were nice. Nice, it doesn\u2019t mean that if they would catch you without a band on the street, that they wouldn\u2019t arrest you or shoot you. But they didn\u2019t go out of their way to do more harm than they were supposed to do. There were a few. There was even one I also described in the book, that one who was also a sergeant, a meister. He used to go for vacation home and he always used to bring stuff that my brother asked him to bring like saccharin and other things which was illegal but he brought it and my brother bought it by him. He made money and my brother made money. Now this is the one, he told us to go with the transport the first day. Because he said, we don\u2019t control, the Gestapo controls it and you never know when the Gestapo changes from one day to another. We went with the first day with the transportation. So we had Blimcia, who else did we have to have there?"

Made sure that we knew Hebrew and as our foreign language in gymnasium, we had a choice between French, German and English. We have chosen English so we have to prepare it, to prepare us for studies in Palestine and to emigration to Palestine. What is if you want to know , it\u2019s very unusual also about him. He didn\u2019t have any sons so you know we took from the family-. You saw the family picture, maybe you remember."

The bad part is which later turned out to be the good one, is that every Friday evening, he made us study with him after dinner. We had to study with him wintertime so called bocherash this is tracked from our sages and the , that means the sa . You know in the Bible each week is different. Imagine three girls to keep us and to study and G-d forbid if we didn\u2019t know it. In summertime when my friends used to go to the park for a walk or to the movies, we had to study with . This is also the things of the sages and the wise men. If one of us didn\u2019t know, he deprived us of allowance to go to movie. You know there was a carrot and stick; a lot of laugh, a lot of devotion, attention, strict like boys. He raised us like a Prussian officer. You know girls like it more easy. Thank G-d my mother was a very sweet, easy- going woman. With my mother we were like friends, she was also very young mother. With him, also he laughed and he bossed around four women in his house."

The same thing, my father sent him to the Hebrew school, extra expense. extra clothing and everything. He still wanted very much a boy. Actually this is why he had three daughters because he tried twice. Then he said the third time must be boy and it wasn\u2019t. Now between you and me, it was in his family. All the sons, all the brothers had daughters, all the sisters had sons. It\u2019s unusual but this is how it was.

She had done with her children the same thing what my father with us. They lived like in a summer resort. I remember when we used to come there and his brother from Germany used to come, she used to ask them questions. If somebody didn\u2019t know, she didn\u2019t hesitate to punish them by slapping their face. I remember this as a child when we went there. But the sisters went to school, the sisters used to all play mandolin, progressive. So the brothers nod their heads, progressive. This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

With me, really was luck that the Germans thought I\u2019m Polish and the Poles thought I\u2019m German but no one took me for their own, you know. My boss questioned my eyes, Semitic eyes. In college, I was always on the offensive instead of being on the defensive. You know the book when the policeman followed me and I wanted to know if he\u2019s just a womanizer or really --. He followed me to the ladies\u2019 room. Instead to shiver and to feel defeated, I jump on him, what right do you have to follow me? This is -- after all I knew who he is. This put him off! He was a police and like nothing he would have given me away. In all instances like my boss, I start to say no and to deny and to be caught and to blush, I said most probably my grandmother was Jewish. He thought it\u2019s the best joke. You know this is how I was able. We saw now a movie and I told Norman, it was very similar I acted. Which was it, Norman, the last one that we saw? Oh, you didn\u2019t the movie \u2018Shining Through\u2019?"

He had a very good command of Polish and because we didn\u2019t speak Yiddish, he didn\u2019t have the singsong like I don\u2019t have. I don\u2019t have in my Polish and I don\u2019t have in my English. This helped a lot because if you have the singsong, immediately they recognize it.
