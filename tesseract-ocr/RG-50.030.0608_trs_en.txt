Q: What made it sophisticated?
A: It was very near to the German city, Tilzé, and there was a lot of traffic between
Tauragé and Tilzé, and the so-called Lithuania Minor, or Klaipédos kraStas was
also very near Tauragé, just a few kilometers away, and the relationship with that
German influence, German cultural influenced area, you know, had an effect on
Tauragé also.
Q: Did it — this re — leads me to a question I was also thinking about. As you were
growing up, your very earliest years, did you sense that there were others in
Tauragé who were not Lithuanian? Did you — you know, did you know of other
nationalities, other groups of people, and — who made up the population of

A: A port city of Lithuania and the third in the size on — in the country. The capital
city Vilnius is first, Kaunas second, and Klaipéda is the third. And at that time in
Klaipéda was, I think the majority of the population in Klaipéda city, a majority
may be German about that time. In the countryside not so. In the countryside
Lithuanians pre-predominated, but they were also very much influenced by the
German culture through it — through centuries, really, they were under the German

between those gymnasiums there were no — no relationship really. But I don’t know
why there was no relationship with the Jewish j — schools which were in — in
Panevézys.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: There were no relations. We had some Jews who went to Lithuanian school, and
wa — by class, you know, classmates. But — and we were fine, we were friends, we
were 0-okay. But the relationship between the Jewish gy-gymnasium and Poland —
and Lithuanian gymnasium was just nonexistent. And I don’t know at — even now I
couldn’t explain why it was so, because there was no such hostility at all, and
Lithuanians considered Jews, you know, the Jews also supported Lithuanian claim to
Vilnius usually, the great majority, I wouldn’t know about all but ye — th-the great
majority was supporting that. And they [indecipherable] Lithuania recovered

Q: Why do you think that they even — 1938 would have been motivated by it?
A: Well, we suspected that they always want to take over Lithuania eventually.
That’s one thing. But at that time, Poland considers itself a great power in Europe
and Germany just took over Austria and Poland wanted compensation as a great
power, you know, so at least, you know, they — they took this step against Lithuania
to showing that they are also — can act, you know.

Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
interview with Mr. Algimantas Gureckas on October 14", 2010. Mr. Gureckas, I
wanted to continue our — our discussion about — about the rising tensions in — in your
world, in Panevézys, in Lithuania. And we were talking about the Polish
Lithuanian relationship. As you’re speaking, I’m thinking, how much of this did a 15
year old boy know, because that’s how old you were in 1938; how much of this was
discussed at home? How much do you — can you remember that you knew of it at the
time?
A: Well, a lot, a lot. It affected everybody, affected my family, you know, and so
also affected me. I also felt, you know, that Poles were — were trying, you know,
somehow, you know, to show our superior — their — their superior powers, or their
superior might against a smaller country, and didn’t like it. Didn’t like it at all.
Although I was skeptical at that time about Vilnius, you know. I thought well, you
know, we are no-not going to recover Vilnius ever. I didn’t tell anybody not — not
that my father, nor — nor my mother, nor — nor my friends. But I thought wow, that’s
— that’s an unrealistic, we might as well forget about it. But — but this was then a
Polish ultimatum, the Polish demand, you know. It still hurt. Still hurt very much,
you know.

helping during the 1905, 1905 there was a revolution in Russia, and in Lithuania it
took a national character; Lithuanians against the Russian suppression. So, why — my
father hid, you know, the — the revolutionaries — my grandfather.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: My mother found out, I mean, that he hid the revolutionaries who were trying to
get — when — when the revolution was suppressed, trying to get into Germany and
later maybe to United States to escape from that pole — tsarist oppression. So, you
know, it’s tradition going way back. And I don’t know how to explain. It was a small
country, and the fe — people felt that, you know, these things really affect them. The
country’s independence was precarious during that time, and of course, I mean, my
father was working for the government, so 1-if — if —1f the country is occupied, I

the Soviet Union? What role did that play in Panevézys, you know, and what was
going on? What did you know of what was going on in Soviet Russia, and the union
itself?
A: We knew some, we knew the — you know, my ma — my f-— my father see the
beginnings of the Russian revolution in Russia. I would say so. Again, the Polish
thing. Soviet Union was supporting Lithuania in this Polish Lithuanian conflict. Or
supporting Lithuania’s claim to Vilnius.
Q: All along?
A: All along. The only one of the great powers. The Germans also didn’t recognize
the Polish annextion of Vilnius, but the Germans were not willing to, you know, to
take stand, or support Lithuania or something like that. So they kept more or less
outside of that — of that issue. The Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan supported
Poland. So the only great power supporting — United States were behind the area,
you know, they didn’t — it was time of isolation, they didn’t — tried not to take any
stance in European affairs at all. So the only real power supporting Lithuania was
Soviet Union. Now, my parents, being good Catholics and Lithuanians, they
disapproved of the communist system as such. But there was little discussion of that,

Klaipéda, you know, and well, was a very sad moment for Lithuania, but we felt
that’s — it was a superior — superior power, couldn’t do much about it.
Q: Were there any people that you knew of in Lithuania who were Lithuanians who
supported Hitler? Who thought that the 1 — that the ideology of the Nazi party was
one that had some positive attributes?
A: Ye-es, yes, but not in our circle, in our family circle. The closest I know was our
Catholic priest, a teacher of religion in our school. He was impressed by the order
and discipline of the Nazi movement, and during the lessons, you know, sometimes
he made Germany — the Nazi Germany as an example of, you know, of a
disciplined, purposeful society. But that was really ther — we heard about other
people, you know, who — who were f-friendly to Germans, but there were very, very
few of them, because Lithuania was under direct attack at that time, with Klaipéda.

city. The great impression of the old Lithuanian history connected to the city, where
there were signs all around. The Lithuanian coat of arms, you know, was on the city
gate. Ancient.
Q: There was a — there was a — still a city gate in 1939?

signs, but nothing has — did — as far as history — well, there was some in
combination, when the co-countries — was a Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth while
the countries were united in one commonwealth, there was a — also a no — Polish
eagle, Lithuanian knight, and so on, you know, bi — from those times. But always,
always the Lithuanian knight. And [indecipherable] thing, and so Lithuanian
students met our excursion, and he was a leader of our excursion, so the city told
about how Lithuanians lived under the Poles, you know, and we went to Lithuanian
s-s — girls’ school, the girls — the — it was summer, so the girls went home, so the
school was empty, so — but they accommodated us. So we were — we still in Vilnius
were in midst of the Lithuanian community there, which was very small, and really
oppressed, but they were proud because they felt that they were oppressed, and they
were right that there was something wrong, you know, with the Polish government,
that they — they were oppressing the Lithuanians anyways.

comparing how it is and we looked, you know, boy, our soldiers look much more,

there were also the signs all over the Vilnius that — in Polish — that we are not going

knew the war is coming, or at least suspected the war is coming, and they — they are
not going like the Czechs or Lithuanians who gave up Klaipéda, or the Czechs who

British and French, you know, just — just went home. That was the whole power

you know, the Blitzkrieg. They — they went very, very strongly wi-with air — air
attacks, armored formations. So we thought well, you know, why Lithuanian army
doesn’t go there and recover Vilnius, because Poles will be not able to resist any
more.

Germans are going to lose, and we shouldn’t interfere in the war now. He didn’t say
that, you know, he — he simp — in sympathy with Poles or something. Maybe he was,
I don’t know. But he was convinced that the Nazis are going to lose. And it seems
like not some kind of a military or — or — or economical analysis, but because the
Nazi ideology, that generation knew Germans from the first occupation during the
first World War. And they were convinced that the Germans were always overdoing.

Q: Overreaching themselves?
A: Overreaching. In the first World War, and from the Nazi ideology they deducted
that the Nazis are ric — ready to do the same thing, to overreach more, even more
than the — during the first World War. So they were — and our president, Antanas
Smetona also was of that opinion. Some of the officers of Lithuanian army, some o-
of the diplomats said, I mean, it’s a chance to recover Vilnius, let’s go, and Germans
were encouraging Lithuanians, encouraging, you know, that wil — Lithuania wil —
would go and recover Vilnius. And the British said, in that case, Great Britain will
declare war against Lithuania. But well, now this is the question, who will de — will
win the war, and Smetona was convinced that Germans are going to lose, and he
didn't — we didn’t know about that time, but we knew, you know, later, that Smetona
was against that, and that’s why Lithuania didn’t — didn’t attack Poland at that

against the Nazi thinking, not only as — as German, but generally against Nazi and

just like alliance between Finns and Germans, you know. Not — they — Finns didn’t
became Nazis at all, they were allies during the second World War with the
Germans, but they still were a democratic country, and had nothing to do with the
Nazi ideology at all. So that was the idea. Of course, it was unrealistic. If — 1f would
have happened, of course, Nazis would have taken everything that — but the hope
was that, you know, well, so we are allies, just like we were allies with the Soviets,

Beginning Tape Three
Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
interview with Algimantas Gureckas on October 14", 2010. Mr. Gureckas, where
we left off, you were describing to us how you saw the downed Soviet plane which
had fought — which was flying against — in the Finnish — the Winter War against
Finland, how it landed near Panevézys, and you saw the dismantled parts of it being
taken by Soviet soldiers, and it aroused a great deal of curiosity amongst the — the
kids in school, and you all went to the windows to take a look. I wanted to ask a
question about, let’s say, how kids felt then when these events were happening. And
bring it back to the very beginning of tensions. Did you, as — as young students have
an urge to do something, whether it was against the Germans, or against the Poles, or
against the Soviets, to defend your country? Were there any such student types of
discussions or ideas going on, or even actions that were taken?
A: Well, I could tell about one really ridiculous thing, because we were 15 years old
when the — there was a tension about Klaipéda, a problem, the Germans were
pressing Lithuania at that time, and it was clear that they will, sooner or later will
demand that Lithuania return Klaipéda, together with the Klaipéda territory to
Germany. So my classmate, and my close friend, he told me that he heard a rumor
that there is no organization, but secretly Lithuanian army is mobilizing, taking the
volunteers, registering the volunteers, and he — he kind of suggested that we might

my turn, y-you know. And we went together with him to —
Q: Did you tell your father?
A: No, of course not. That would be the end of the story. No, we went together with
him to the military office in Panevézys, and just asks whether, you know, they —
they need any voluntaries to fight for Lithuania. Well, the sergeant there was kind
of a — excited. I mean, he was — he was dumbfounded really, you know. And we
couldn’t understand why — why he was you know, so kind of confused. We just
wanted to fight for Lithuania, that’s all, that seems so — and he, an elderly sergeant,
you know, was a pr — now I can see, you know, why — why he was — the children

Jewish friend. He was one of our gang, Shalamas(ph) Rubinsteinas(ph), and he —

there was the ultimatum and they marched into Lithuania and in Panevézys Sunday
afternoon, I saw the first communist demonstration in Panevézys in the main square.
The people didn’t — didn’t walk the streets. It was Sunday and the city was kind of
empty. I went to s — into this — the city to take a look at what’s going on. Nothing.
Were — were very few people going dur — during the streets, in the streets. Not like a
regular Sunday. And then I went to the main square and there was a demonstration,
not a big one, maybe 50 - 60 people there.
Q: Young, old?
A: Mostly young, I would say, mostly young people. And they were — had the red
flag there, and they were speaking in Lithuanian, you know, against the sovi —

Q: What did he say — what did he tend to say about those communists that were his

w-with France collapsing, many people were thinking that Lithuania might not be
able to survive as independent country. And there was a discussion going on, which
is better, that the Germans would take over or the — or the Russians? Because Po-
Poland wa-was gone, you know, was conquered by the — by both of them and
partitioned. And I would say — I was inclined that it ba — may be better under the
Germans, my opinion. Not very strong, but I was leaning that way. But th — I would
say the majority of Lithuanians we knew in — in the circle, were of the opinion that
maybe the Russians occupation would be more benign, because the Russians are not
that efficient, not that organized in our opinion.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: And — and Lithuanian nation would have a better chance to survive longer — long
time than under harsh and efficient German occupation. So even at that point, people
were leaning more toward the Russians than the Germans, more toward the Soviets.

Q: Show me — explain to me how this threat made itself felt. Even — you know, you
have a— up to th —I have a picture of Soviets in the streets, Russian soldiers in the
streets, this demonstration, an ideology that’s against the — the former independent
government and so on. But what makes this scary? What makes this aggressive?
A: Well, they started arresting people pretty soon, you know, I don’t know, ma —
maybe not the first week, but the second or third week, some of Lithuania’s
ministers from the previous government were arrested and brou — and not arrested in
Lithuania, but arrested and brought to the Soviet Union. And then, just in about a
month time, you know, the — a lot of people get arrested, including my director of
our high school.
Q: The one who said that Germany would lose the war?
A: Right. Yeah, he was arrested, I —- a— a—a good man, you know, we knew, and a
lot of other people who were considered, you know, like leading in this society,
having influence in the society. There were thousands arrested. And the thing, you
know, the — there was a prison in Panevézys in the center of the city, built by the
tsars, not far from the — our house. Our house was in the neighborhood of — of that
prison. And right there, you know, the prison was — had bars in — in the windows.
Now the bars stayed, but once the Russians came in, you know, they put like some
boxes over the windows, so th-they couldn’t see. Maybe they could see from the —
one — from the top, the — the sun, some — some light, but they couldn’t see anything

isolate people they couldn’t see outside. Yeah, and pretty soon even the — from our —
from our gymnasium, from our — not from our class, but you know, they were
arrested, even — even the students.

A: Upperclassmen, yeah.

A: Upperclassmen.
Q: Did you know any of them?
A: Oh yes, yes, yes.
Q: Can you surmise what — you know, individuals, why they were arrested, why they
would have been arrested?
A: Yeah, one of them was active in that Daiteninkai(ph), that Christian Catholic
organization, before — apparently therefore, he was arrested. Well, the resistance
movement started already, so that might be the things they — and they were not very
par-particular to get exactly their man, you know. And 1f-if they wanted to get their
man, you know, and they didn’t know who it is, so they took 10 of them, thinking

that most likely one of them will be the — they are looking for. And that’s it, that’s —
that was — pretty soon we found that that mattered, you know. The terror started
pretty soon. Not the first days, but pretty soon. And of course, everything changed.
My father lost his job. A lot of people were changed in — 1n governing positions, 1n —
even in technical positions. So — but no-not only that, but a lot of people were losing
their jobs and — in the government, and in administration. And everything that, you

after this incident in — in — in PanevéZzys, when we had to enforce the commandant’s
hour, it was vacation time, as far as the school is concerned. So I went to my
mother’s farm, which was where she was come from, and her sister was there, you
know, running the farm with her husband. And so I went there, and I went there
because I thought — I mean, this — this territory might be taken over by the Germans.
There were rumors you know, that —
Q: And you preferred to still, you know — yeah.
A: Yeah, since I preferred to stay wi-with the Germans, you know, I-I thought
maybe — now I found out th-that not — there was a division. The Germans were
taking — supposed to take over part of Lithuania there. But nobody knew exactly,
you know, where the — the dividing line would be. But eventually they didn’t. The
Russians took over the — the entire country. So, then they went back home and we
went on our regular vacation with our — my uncle in the — in the eastern Lithuania

quiet place. There was not much going. We heard on the radio, we read 1n the
newspapers all the changes going on in the country.
Q: And this is by the — by this point Soviet press, Soviet Lithuanian press?
A: Y-Yes, it all — officially some of them that still had old names, but obviously they
were run already by different people appointed by the new government. So it was a
quite — we were — you know, we were disturbed what — about what it was happening,
but at that particular place, nothing much was happening. And people were all
concerned, everybody was tense. There was supposed to be elections to the people’s
parliament, where you know, there were exactly that many candidates as had to be
elected deputies. People boy — boycotted th-that, or even if they voted, they drew,
you know, the cartoon characters instead of the bulletins inside. But that was about
it, there — there was not much, and the meantime they annexed Lithuania. This —
this parliament was called into the session and accepted the request
[indecipherable] Lithuania would be included in the Soviet Union. And we were
working with my father in the forest, and came out of the forest into the small town,
and we saw that there were some red flags out, and we asked — I mean, what’s —
what’s now? I mean, what’s new? And there was a — a smith working at the edge of
the town, and we ask him, what — what’s now, I mean, why — why the red flags here?
Said, well, they annexed — they annexed Moscow to Lithuania. So that was that,

back to Panevézys, and Panevézys there were changes, there were cha —
Q: What kind of changes did you see?
A: Well, even the Soviet placards ne — red, you know, flags everywhere, you know,
[indecipherable]. Pretty soon my father was fired from his job, had to look for — for
s — for some other job, finally found in a bank, as a clerk in a bank. Those — those
things, let’s see, when — when did military took over? Part of our — yeah, I think at
that time, yeah, they — they were [indecipherable]. We were supposed to have that
much living space, we had much more in our own house, so they took the rest of it,
and put the s — the Soviet officers into our house.

Interview with Algimantas Gureckas _
October 14, 2010
A: Not much. First of all, was completely obvious and natural that the Jewish
community was glad that Lith-Lithuania was not occupied by the Germans, and if it
had to go down, you know, it’s better that the Russians took over. With that, many
Lithuanians would have agreed. But now, you know, the — the — we — we noticed
pretty soon the hostility against independent Lithuania, against the previous, not
only government, but the country itself. Now, it’s very difficult to say how prev —
prev — prevalent this — this attitude was. There was definitely some, in particular in
the younger generation there. For us Lithuanians, was a gr-great surprise. We never
thought that our relations are bad, we never thought that the Jewish people are
somehow disadvantaged in Lithuania or — or discriminated against. Yet, the
community was kind of separate, jewi — but we were — we were thinking and wer-
were convinced that that was the choice of the Jewish community. They wanted to
have their own schools, they wanted to have, of course, their religions and
synagogues and all that kind of thing, and their organizations. And we didn't mind,
but a lot of their life was separate from Lithuanian. There were some Jews which
were integrated into Lithuanian society, but there were very few of them.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: There were some — some doctors, s — in particular in — in professions. And now,
you see, I — since the Soviet terror became obvious quite soon, it 1s very difficult to
say. Those who were for the Soviet system became very loud. And they wanted to

make, you know, career, to make a do — to — to advance in this new s — new society.
So they were a — loud, they were active, they were running around. They were
tearing off the Lithuanian symbols, you know, from — from the houses or wherever
they were — they were. Those who were against them whether Lithuanian or Jewish
or whatever, were kind of subdued. Because the terror was there, there was no sense
starting, you know, frankly, resisting that, or —
Q: Openly resisting it.
A: Openly, yeah.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: So those who were against that were quiet and tried to be, you know, not — not
obvious, you know, with — with —
Q: Not noticeably —
A: — their opinions there, so you know. So it’s this — that’s why it’s very difficult to
say how much of Jewish communi — community were collaborating with the Sov —
Soviet occupation. But it — it was obvious that they were, because knew — officers
knew — knew people with responsibility there, a lot of them were Jewish. Not all of
them, some of them were Lithuanian communists, but there were not that many
Lithuanian communists. All Lithuanian communists got good and significant
positions at that time, tasks to do, but there weren't that many of them. And once
they ran out of them, also the Jewish people came in and there were — there were

more of them, I-lot — I— I don’t know percentage-wise — in numbers wouldn’t be
more, but percentage-wise definitely there were more Jewish collaborators than
Lithuanian collaborators with the Soviet government. There were also Russians. The
Russians also was a split community because part of them were glad that, you know,
the Russians were taking over the country. Even the tsarist refugees from the tsarist
gov — from the Soviet government, who fled to Lithuania said well, it’s — th-they
might destroy us, you know, the Russians, who were against this — the Soviets, but
it’s still nice that the Russia is expanding again.
Q: Did you have someone say that to you, or did you —
A: Not a ma — to — 1-1-1s — as somebody told to my father that, exactly.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: A—a Russian he knew, you know, friendly. So — and so some of them
collaborated, but some of them, of course, also tried to just disappear from the view,
so not to attract any attention, so that they wouldn’t be, you know, repressed like
[indecipherable] or the — of the government.

couldn’t de-defend itself, it was just too — too weak. The bases were inside already.

A: No, 1-1- not the — not the bases. The bases somehow was accepted as in-in-
inevitable. Estonia had that, Latvia had that, war was going on, you know, the
situation was unclear, how the war will develop was not clear. Somehow it looked
too early to start and fight, you know, at that time. It — it looked like it’s a right thing
to play for time. And that was playing for time, but maybe we’re — we’re wrong. I
mean, it would be much more effective fighting right — right there in 1939, but we
were not Finns, we were not that organized like Finns, so Lithuania couldn’t bring
defend also, but would be more — would be more known, you know, would have
attracted more attention in — in the world.
Q: It s — it sounds like what was going on in Moscow, and what people knew in —
like your family in Panevézys, as plugged in as you were —

more. So it — when I telling now the story, I have to watch myself to put myself in
that time, not what I know now about those — the things —
Q: That’s exactly —
A: — because I have read a lot of materials about those times, about negotiations,
about decisions being taken at that time. But at that time it looked like in 1939, was
distasteful and — and dangerous, but correct decision to accept the bases, playing for
time. But not resisting in 1940, it seemed like the really was — was, as I say, betrayal.
It was — 1t wasn’t a decision which could be justified, really. So when we were trying
to fight the Soviets when the Germans attacked, it was desp — because Lithuania
didn’t resist then, now we have to fight.
Q: I see.

Q: No sense of — of how much anti-Soviet sense there is — sentiment there is. And
what happens then, after that? I’d like to — the next half year, let’s say from January
18, 1941 until when the Nazis invade the Soviet Union, and what — Lithuania is
now a part of it.
A: Right.
Q: What happens in that half year? [technical direction] How many minutes?

Interview with Algimantas Gureckas ms
October 14, 2010
Beginning Tape Four
Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum
interview with Algimantas Gureckas on October 14", 2010. Mr. Gureckas, I just
asked you about what was the year — what was the next half year between January
and June 1940, what events took place, what things developed, but I thought of
another question I wanted to ask, preceding that. And that 1s, of all these betrayals
that we’re talking about: betrayal by the independent Lithuanian government, what
was left of it, betrayal by the, you know, small group of let’s say refugees from
tsarist Russia, who liked the idea of Russian domination, even if it was with their
internal enemies before, betrayal by the Jewish community, or betrayal by
Lithuanian — Gentile Lithuanians, ethnic Lithuanians, who were communists
themselves. Which betrayal do you think you felt in your heart most keenly? Or
maybe another betrayal?
A: No, no. I think the Jewish, because several things. Russian community was so
small that it was really insignificant. Our government, pretty — find out that there
was a split of opinion about that, and there was b-betrayal in the high military
command. So — also, you know, difficult. Now, Jewish, proble — problem is that —
because maybe we were — or were — were mistaken, but we had the impression that
the Lithuanian Jewish relations are very good. That there is no ispy — th-there was
some Jewish communists, okay, you know — well, more than Lithuanian maybe,

percentage-wise, but that was not really significant. The Jewish community
supported Lithuanians in the Vilnius question. They supported Lithuania’s
independence, they — Smetona had very good relations with the Jewish community’s
leaders, you know? So we didn’t see the reason why — we, as I said, maybe they felt
being discriminated, because it was difficult for them, you know, to — to — you know,
to become officers in the army, in the police, and something like that. There was
some ethnic discrimination in Lithuania. But those who really wanted could, you
know, like Gensis(ph) was an officer in Lithuanian army, and very valued. So there
Q: You’re referring to Jakub Gens who ended —
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: — ended up being the —
A: Commandant —
Q: — chief of police of Vilnius ghetto.
A: That’s right, that’s right. He was a Lithuanian officer from the time of the Wars
of Independence. He became officer in the Lithuanian military school, and had a
very distinguished career in Lithuanian army, in the war with Poland. So, just one
example, there were other officers, Jewish officers in Lithuanian army. But benda —
generally, Lithuania being a small country, just established, and in big tr — big
conflict with Poland, and with Germany because of Klaipéda, were looking — they

were discriminating not according to religion or race or anything like that, but about
the perceived loyalty to the state. The most discriminated people, of course, were
Polish. They just didn’t trust any Pole that he wouldn’t be just a spy, you know,
somewhere. So, for pr — a Pole got a government sensitive position was practically
impossible. Then, of course, Jews, because of some communists in there, you know,
in the younger, and because of some cus — cosmopolo — cosmopolitic approach. A
sophisticated approach which Lithuania looked at them kind of s-such small,
ridiculous state, you know. They were yus — universal people, they — they were not —
not that much ag-gainst Lithuania, but ri — but discounting Lithuania. And that also
for having some — somebody like that in military or police would seem I-like risky,
you know, h-h-he doesn’t care about this country. So then, Germans. Lithuanian
Germans ou-outside Klaipéda were mostly loyal, very loyal, just like I told about
that, you know, which I re-reme — remember in Tauragé, Greigoris(ph), who — who
refused even to — to go to Germany. And the same thing in Panevézys, most of the
Germans are loyal, but Germans still, you know, some. And then later, you know,
there were Tartars and Karayims, there were no discrimination whatsoever. Their —
their religion was different, Tartars were Muslim, Karayims had their own religion,
Jewish based, you know. The race, you can s-see Karayim, you know, you could
see from — from the face, from the features. Nim — Kara — Tartars not so much, was
Karayims. But that didn't matter at all. Their people even in — in the army made the

career, good career, you know. There were generals, Tartars, there were colonels,
Karayims, you know. They were as good or better than Lithuanians, no — no
problem. So, the base of discrimination was perceived loyalty of the mi-minority.
Q: Well that — that sort of famous — I’m so sorry I interrupted —
A: Yeah, sure.
Q: — the [indecipherable] you — a sort of well known sentiment, legitimate or not, in
most of the cases not legitimate, of a fifth column.
A: Right, right.
Q: That’s what you’re talking about.
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. And is — being, you know, aware that we are — the country
was, you know, a small country, weak country in — in between dangerous other
countries. So that was one of the considerations, whether it — it was well taken or
not, you know, that’s a different thing, but that was the basic feeling. And now,
basically, as I said, was the feeling that the Jewish community was a friendly
community and there were not really big conflict. There were some conflict in —
commercial areas between Lithuania, but the government wasn’t involved 1n that at
all. Smetona’s government was against any anti-Semitism at all. And — and the
people also, so —
Q: And yet there was acceptable, as far as what I’ve read —
A: Yeah.

Q: — did not — did not bypass Lithuania, that as the decade wore on, within the
society itself —
A: Right.
Q: — there were such sentiments. That’s what many historians —
A: Yeah.
Q: — have claimed. Do you think that there — those are — outside of any, you know,
any events that we’re talking about now, would you say that that has validity to it?
A: Most likely so. It’s difficult for me to say th — because we’re talking about the
circle, my circle, my — my parents —

A: — my dear friends, my friends, classmates, I didn’t feel that.
Q: Okay.
A: A-A-And all that circle, I din — didn’t feel that. Yes, I knew there were some
incidents, some 1-in between Lithuanian farmers and — and — and Jewish merchants,
but it — yeah, there were so, there was tension between Lithuanians coming into the
commercial area, trying to establish their businesses. There is a competition,
sometimes this competition went out of bounds, you know, from both sides. The

Jews tried, you know, to establish some kind of mo-monopoly, and push out — that
Lithuanian out. Li-Lithuanian also, you know, appealing to some anti-se — anti-
Semitic, you know, feelings. So, apparently there was, but I couldn’t tell ma — much
because it was way beyond my circle. In my circle that — this — this wasn’t felt at all.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah, there were some — for instance, there were some — some Jewish families
changed their house language, their family language from Yiddish to Russian, and
Lithuanians resented that, you know, he — he — they give up Yiddish, why then don’t
— they don’t pick up Lithuanian? And Y1-Yiddish didn’t — didn’t bother anybody,
Hebrew didn’t bother anybody, but Russian, why Russian, you know? But — but —
but I heard myself, I mean, f-father and son Jewish speaking in Lithuanian. So there
were those who did that, you know, and w-went to Lithuanian language. Even in this
museum I saw a Jewish girl writing in ghetto her d — her diary in Lithuanian because
she — she ju-just didn’t know ji — Yiddish that well. So, there were — it was — 1t was a
big community, it was varied situations, but generally, right or no — or not, but in the
people there was a sense of betrayal because they thought that the relations were
good, and they didn’t see the reason why the Jewish community is acting that way,
or much of the community, in particular the younger generation. The older
generation, of course, didn’t partici — participate in — in that, but as I said, they just —
they just were in — behind the picture, you know. Nobody cared much about the — the

rabbis or something like that, how — how they look at the things. Now, I also write in
my memoirs that, one interesting thing that one of our — our family’s friend was Dr.
Bridges family, Dr. Bridges, Andrew Bridges was a doctor, you know, his
specialty eyes, you know, and he had some Jewish friends, some Jewish also
doctors. And during the Soviet occupation, the first year of — the first Soviet
occupation, he-he was told by one of his friends, Jewish friends, that the Jewish
community leaders from the independence period, were concerned about this
reaction of the younger generation, and they called some of the active — well, pro —
pro-communist, younger, active people and talked with them, and asked them not —
not to overdo things, that it is dangerous, that the Jewish community, living hundreds
of times bet-between other nationalities, tried not to become hostile to the people
they are living between. Tried to be neutral, you know, and th-th-they e — taking
sides, they couldn’t have survived, because they would also, you know, provoke a
lot of hostility. And they asked those younger generation Jews to tone down, to tone
down. And they said the younger — the young people just lef — la — just laughed at
them. The old people they don’t understand anything, and their rules, I mean, are ob-
obsolete and — and didn't want even to listen to them. So apparently even in the
Jewish community, there was some perception that somebody is o-overdoing the
things. Now, was — as I say, you know, those who were against this reaction, you
know, they we — they were — they were 1-in — invisible, they tried to be-become

invisible. Now you asking about the period from — in early 1940s. Really the
breakthrough was the annexation earlier, in 1940, August, I think the third or fifth,
about that time. Right after the annexation, the thing changed. Now the terror
intensified consid — considerably, and the resistance started getting organized. So
now, la — a lot of people, even in — in — in — in — in my class, like Grimkas(ph) and
Ar-Arbuk(ph) were arrested from resistance. But even the [indecipherable]
resistance, the people who were prominent in the — in the society generally, most of
them were arrested, th-thousands now. Now it became a mass thing. Now there was
nationa — nationalization; the business establishments, commercial establishments,
industrial things were nationalized. I was my-myself, we — we s-students had to go
there, write, you know, in the — whatever belongs to that merchant establishment,
and to be nationalized with the owners. Now, somehow you know, the Lithuanian
owner who owns some business or — or — or — or business establishment, they — they
were just thrown out. Now the Jewish, usually you know, still remain there as a
specialist. Just because usually there were some in the family, or in — 1n their circle
who had influence with the new government. So apparently they tried, you know, to
help each other. And pretty ba — became pretty obvious, you know, the things are
nationalized, the Jews are still in their places, running the business as before. Of
course now, in government’s name, for — in government’s account, Lithuanians are
just without a job, you know, just — just waiting around. What’s the matter, you

know, it’s always the — these — these things started accumulating. The resentment
against the Jewish reaction increased strongly. As the terror increased, increased the
— the — the — the reaction. Also, because some of them, you know, even communist
Jews went into the security e-e-establishment.
Q: Were these people known by name, or was this just what was dis — this was
understood, or discussed, I mean, what was the basis of this point of view, this — this
— this belief that there were Jews in the security establishment?
A: Well, they were visible.
Q: I see.
A: They went, they arrested people, they interrogated people, they — yeah, th-th-they
— after annexation, everything became visible. Th-They — they didn't — the terror —
concealed terror is not a terror. I mean, they — and then the terror really started after
the annexation. It really — what we suspected, what we were afraid, now, you know,
came to fruition. Now you didn’t have to be afraid, you knew. You knew. That’s —
that’s how it is. That’s how it is, that’s how it will be. And it — it — it gets stronger
and stronger, more and more people arrested, until the big deportations.
Q: Well, tell us about the big deportations. What happened then? When did it
happen, and what happened?
A: Well, it was in — 1n — in naja — I don’t remember exactly the date, but that’s 1941,
June 14 maybe? About that, 14 - 13. Yeah, one night, you know, coming — well, in

my 0-op-opinion. We were walking with my father through Panevézys. There was —
no, that was different, I’m sorry, that’s — that’s start of the war. Suddenly, you know,
of — we — we got up one morning and saw that, you know, our friends are being —
being taking, arrested and being taking to the railroad station. I was working in the
middle of the city, and I saw, you know, a — a— a truck going there, you know, an
open truck, and I saw, you know, the family we knew, who was my father’s, really,
superior for a time. We saw that family, the old — the old lady there, and their girl
and him, you know, in that truck, and soldiers with the s-set bayonets around them,
being taking to the railroad station. And — and a lot of people. Our teachers
disappeared, you know. Our teacher o-of the Russian language was a Lithuanian
diplomat, he was arrested, there was no Russian class there. He died from s-
starvation in Siberia. And so, you know, anybody could, there was no reason, there
— pretty soon there was no reason — we couldn’t detect the reason who is safe. Yeah,
well, the members of the communist party, and the — of the communist activists,
those who really contributed, who we-were working on the deportation, maybe they
were Safe, but nobody else. There was no, you know, anybody could be arrested,
anybody could be deported.
Q: Did you know at that point, when you saw the truck, the open truck, that this —
this was a — a deportation that was a mass deportation, or did you see many trucks go

to the train station? Wa — can you kind of draw us a picture? What was it that you
saw, and what you understood.
A: Yeah, well, I didn’t see too many because most of them went during the
nighttime, and I don’t know why this family was picked up — we-well, there were
more people, not only this family in the truck.
Q: Yes.
A: But th-that was like after action actions, you know, something — people they
might — might missed or something.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: But pretty soon we knew, I mean th-the railroad station was full of people, you
know, the trains were full, and they were pushing those people, w-we — we knew,
you know.
Q: Did you go to the train station?
A: No, I didn’t. I didn't. I-I didn’t want to risk be — because I — we didn’t know, w-
we didn’t know — now we know, you know, aba — apparently how that was done, but
at that time there was no — no understanding what was going on and woo — who is 1n
danger, who is not. My mother opened — and tr-tried to — to — to — to think what —
what we should take to go into Siberia, you know, now. And — and that was open

we were shocked. We were shocked, we didn’t expect anything like that. They were
saying, oh, your prostitutes are taking to — to Siberia, they will learn how to work.
Prostitutes, the — the kids, the families, you know.
Q: Does that Ukrainian au pair still living in the house?
A: Yeah, but — but they were very rarely at home. Th-The ka — this — the red army
was on some kind of alert already, so they were mostly at their bases, wherever that
was.
Q: And at that point, did you connect the dots and see what she was saying, or even
then there was such confusion, that you had no idea that this could be Siberia, the
Siberia she was telling you to prepare for.
A: Yeah, yeah, we connected that. We connected. And we — particular the Russian
literature, the Soviet literature we had — we had to read, you know, some of the
Sholokhov’s novels, and there is about de-deportations. And couldn’t understand, I
mean, so-some — some silly thing, some unrealistic thing. I mean, they come, they
arrest the farmers there, you know, they bring them to Siberia, but what for, I mean,
what did they do, and the whole family? Why — why the whole family? If the farmer
did something wrong, you know, hm. We di-didn’t understand. It — it looks kind of
silly to me, I — but then I remembered, then I remembered that — that — that day.

A: Ye — oh — we didn’t know what’s going on to — to the extent that oh, some of the
people we know, you know, when the — they came for them to be deported, the — the
father of the family, the man, ran away. He saw, you know, somebody coming, he
thought they’re coming to arrest him, because there were so many arrests, you
know? But n-not the families, there were people arrested, whoever was, you know,
they wanted to arrest. So they ran away and ha — hid, and their family was taken and
dep — brought to the railroad station. Now, the man realizing that, came out, went to
the railroad station, and whatever happens, he wanted to be with his family. He
didn’t realize that families were broken up, that the men were sent to concentration
camps, and the families were sent to the — to the Siberian farms and something like
that. So you see, even at the moment, people were so — that confused, didn’t know,
you know, the method what was going on. So there was no sense for him because he
was — he wasn’t let to go with his family.
Q: But he was taken?
A: He was ta — oh, of course, yeah, he was taken, yeah. And very few survived there,
i-in there, in particular the first deportation. But, as I say, we realized that the Jews
are also being deported, yes, and quite — quite many of them.
Q: How did you realize this?
A: Well, we saw, I mean, people just disappearing all — all around you. Ma — my
friend Rubinsteinas(ph), his family. Our — our classmate Borokas(ph), his family,

they are deported. They were lucky. They were lucky, they didn’t know. At that time
we were — thought it means how — how bad, how cruel, but they had 50 - 50 chance
of survival in Siberia. My friend Rubinstein(ph) survived, and Borokas(ph)
survived. They — they would — I don’t know whether Borokas(ph) was visiting
Lithuania, you know, now, and Rubinstein(ph) I don’t — he married local girl,
stayed there in Russia. Whether he visited Lithuania, I don’t know. And
[indecipherable] but at that time it looked — the horror, the same horror as for the
others. But many Jewish activists were acting in that deportation. So, again, you
know, it should have been more. The — the people still didn’t — didn’t quite, you
know — just because Jews are being deported, didn’t quite, you know, justify the
whole Jewish community because of that, because the activists still were there, you
know. Not the only ones, but there were quite a few of them, quite many. Clear
majority of the civilians taking care of that, except the Russian soldiers, of course.
So —
Q: So you’re saying a clear majority of those who participated in deportations
happened to be Jewish?
A: I would say so, I would say so. From what I hear, you know, they say the Jews,
the Jews, the Jews deported, you know, I don’t know. I didn't take any samples or
anything like that, but from what I heard, yeah, 1t seemed so. Well, majority was
Russian soldiers.

thought it’s thunder, but somehow the sound came through the — through the ground,
not through the air. Such a strong that our small house, you know, just — just —

they were high up. Now, what’s going on here, you know, something exploded in —

o-over — stay overnight there. And we heard, you know, we heard cars going on,
motorcycles, commands, but very difficult to say, commands in any language sounds
similar. And suddenly a motorcycle went through our street very quickly. Most
likely it was already the German, but we stayed inside until morning, and in the
morning somebody come running and said, Germans are in the town.

Lithuanians rewa — you know, took over Vilnius even before Germans attacked.
Then Kaunas the same thing. But Panevézys was between the German armored
attacks. It was not that important military center, so it came — I think it was 26".
Warsaw the 22, the re — Lithuanian insurrection started 23, and Panevézys was
taken, I think, 26.
Q: So if the insurrection started in — in — o-on June 23", and you know, it was
Lithuanian, how did it express itself in Panevézys, what happened there?
A: Nothing much, the — because nobody had weapons, organization was broken
down by deportations. They was supposed to get weapons su — from somewhere, but
the people who were supposed to get those weapons, some of them were deported,
the other went into hiding. One went to Kaunas, participated the — in the revolt
there. And —
Q: Were you supposed to be part of this, was this a resistance group —
A: Yes.
Q: — that you were taking par — uh-huh.
A: Yes, but — but nothing happened. We just didn’t have anything, no — no weapons,
no — well, organization was — we reestablished organization, but so what?
Q: Yeah.

disappeared and they came back to the empty — empty prison. Well, was too late to
do anything, it was hours before the Germans appeared. But still, you know, the —
the — they — they knocked out a German — a — a Soviet tank somewhere you know, I

A: I realize that, you know, [indecipherable] from what I read, was completely
different in Kaunas. The Germans came in right there and started anti-Jewish
actions right there involving Lithuanians. In Vilnius also pretty soon like that. But
Panevézys the Germans didn’t care about anything except their military tasks,
whatever they had. And nobody attacked Jews until — until the funeral of the doctors
and the other people who were killed by the Soviets.

Q: Tell us about how they were killed, the doctors, and then what was this funeral,
when was it, and why was this a catalyst?
A: Why the doctors were killed is — 1s — I— ou — nobody really understands.
Q: What were the circumstances of —
A: The doctors were operating on Soviet soldiers which were injured by the German
bombing of Pajuoste. They were brought to the hospital and the doctors, the
surgeons were working on them, operating, and the nurse also, she — she works wi-
with the doctors. Now, somebody said that somebody broken into the hospital
looking for weapons, because the soldiers brought to the hospital, they thought
maybe they could get weapons there. Which is nonsense, nobody brought them with
the be — weapons. I mean, they were injured — injured soldiers, so they were brought
to the hospital, the weapons stayed wherever they were serving. But I don’t know
how much is rumor, how much is right, but in any case, there were some communist
youth guards in the hospital and they telephoned the security that somebody is trying
to break into the hospital.
Q: That is the secret police, the Soviet —
A: Secret police, yeah. And then the secret police came, took the doctors, took the
nurse and just — just killed them — not — not just shot, but really, you know, murder —
murdered them to — to death, you know, by — by — by horrible, horrible torture.
How? It’s — it’s nonsense, I mean, the doctors, I d— I don’t know why.

the Lithuanian surroundings, so they were terrified. And terrified people are
dangerous people, because they are irrational then, and they just — so-so that — that’s

is — does — doesn’t make any sense, there were n-no weapons in the — in the hospital
and no possibility of the weapons [indecipherable] real, you know. So so-somebo —

Jew. And when the people saw the blood, you know, all this group of people who
were standing yo — just stepped back, you know, maybe three steps back and dis-

was involved in those actions, doctors or sugar fac — factory, no. So apparently

lived in Panevézys. But he was kind of drafted, or asked as a translator for the

youth organization or something, were taken out and shot, without any 1-inquiry,
without any court, without any pro-procedure, just like that, you know, and a lot of
innocent people were just killed, like this — in Panevézys and in surrounding

many of those, but definitely just some — some Jews were killed. Some Lithuanians,

because his pistol was right there, you know, and a lot of money, Russian, Soviet
money. And a s —a small piece of paper, you know, with scribbled writing, but not
Lithuanian, apparently Yiddish. So I looked at, he — he was dead, definitely. I took
the pistol, and the money.
Q: Was he shot in the head? Did he shoot himself —
A: In the head. Yeah, he shot himself in the head.
Q: Was this the first time you saw a corpse? Because up until here, we haven’t
talked about you — you’ve talked about things you heard.
A: Yeah.
Q: But not necessarily what you yourself saw.
A: No, I— the only corpses I have seen before, and a f — few of them were during the
funerals, during the wake. But also very few of them. But —

you were with this old — this old couple who were very frightened, old Jewish
couple.
A: Right.
Q: And you had just found the corpse of a young man in their shed. Do you think
there was a connection between this young man and them?
A: I think so. I think h-he might have been th-their son, or — or a close relative, but I

thought is going — going to happen, there will be, well maybe not quite independent,
but something like Hungary, or — or Slovakia, something like that, you know, that
we will — will be independent country together with — with Germany, you know,
allied willingly or not. And then the other day, I went to the police, I don’t know
why, do-don’t remember exactly, went to the police, and — but I remember the view,
which was very shocking to me. There was an old man, apparently a Jew, an old
man, you know, and he was standing like in the corner, and on his forehead was
written in, I would say maybe it looked like wet ashes, you know, make something
like that and then smear on that, and it was called Zydas.
Q: In Lithuanian.
A: In Lithuanian.
Q: So that means Jew.
A: Jew.
Q: And he was inside the police station?
A: And he was inside the police station, was standing in the corner, the people were
going around their business there, you know, nobody was paying any attention to
him as far as I could see. I don’t know, I — I just left that police and j-just stays in my

me.
Q: Was he — do — was he — you say he was an old man, do you remember what he
looked like? Was he small, was he large?
A: No, he was small, he was bald, yeah. That — that — that was very shocking to me,
that’s why I remember it. Well, I went back home, then didn’t have any di — nothing
when I went to staff, they had nothing for me for awhile. We met some Germans, we
drank with them. My school German became conversational, but my — when we are
— get drunk, you don’t have inhibitions, so it’s mech — much earlier — easier to learn.
The Germans were very friendly, the soldiers. They were — they were soldiers, that’s
all they c-cared, you know, they wer — they were fighting their — the war, and no
politics, nothing her-here. They were friendly people. Now, another day I went, and
they had another task to me. And the Russians — the railroad was a regular western
European railroad in Lithuania, the width. The Russian railroads had different
width. So when the Russians took over, they made a more wide, you know, on the —
Q: Mm-hm, a wider [indecipherable]
A: — the Russian — a Russian standard. Now, the Germans wanted us to bring it back
to the west European, German, or previous Lithuanian standard. So I had to — to — to
go to the prison. There was prisoners of war, Russians, Soviets, you know,
Ukrainians, whatever. I had to take 120 - 150 of them and bring to the railroad, and

And, to watch what — with my friends also, to watch them, you know, working there.
So that’s what we did.
Q: So you guarded them, in other words.
A: We guarded them, yeah.
Q: Yes.
A: And they were — they were working there. It was easy — well, of course, not very
easy, easy because th-there were, you know, before, that width, so it was just re-
return to the old place. And it was narrower, so it’s no problem, n-no — no — no need
to extend anything or something. But, you know, the rails are heavy, you have to — to
lift them and bring it, and so — so it was w-work, you know [indecipherable] many
of them. Now, I was the control. The Ukrainians were very happy people there. They
were, you know, full of fun, you know, they — they had all kinds of funny stories,
and I s-started, you know, to talk with them.
Q: In Russian?
A: In Russian, yeah. They said, you know, all — they were all happy. They knew the
war was over, will be over in months, they go back to free Ukraine, everything will
be just fine. And I saw that I lost, I mean, you know, a war discipline, they — they are

not happy, not like Ukrainians, it’s — it’s a very big difference between. There were
other nationalities. There was one of them, they knew no Russian.
Q: But it was a Soviet soldier?
A: It was a Soviet soldier, he was from Kaukas(ph) or somewhere, th-the Russians
told me, he is from Kaukas(ph), so he doesn’t know any Russian. Yeah, so I don’t
know who he was, but di — you showed to him, he-he did, you know, whatever. They
never — I wa — I never asked them, but they never complained, th-they — I never
asked how they are fed or something like that, but apparently there were no problem,
because nobody complained to me that they didn't have hot food or anything.
Q: How did they look?
A: They look alright to me. There 1s just a few days —
Q: Okay.
A: — they became p-prisoners of war. They were under Lithuanians, not under the

Q: At that point.
A: Yeah, without point. Let me tell you, at that point — without — without — without
any shot being fired from my gun, I — I didn't — didn’t have any — no need, no
opportunity. I wasn’t in any fi-fighting in the action, nothing. So I came back home
and just was waiting until the Lithuanian army will be reestablished, we will be
mobilized and we’ ll be sent to fight the — the Soviets together with the Germans, just
like Finns, like Hungarians, Italians, Bulgarians are doing. So that was the big
illusion, you know, and no — no Germans didn’t — didn’t want any — any of our
services, and — of Lithuania’s service. Now, as far as the Jews are concerned, until
that, you know, nothing happened except for those p-previ — early executions. The
early executions, of some of the com — my communist friends, you know, that — who
were in the communist youth organization, fled together with the Soviet army when
the Germans approached Panevézys.

A: — sugar factory. And th-those come — those communist youth people, they — they
got rifles, they were — had weapons, and they were f-fleeing together with the red
army, retreating. The Germans, well, you need map really. The Germans went one
way from K-Kaunas to Dofilis(ph) in Latvia, Pskov in Russia, directly towards
Saint Peterburg; Leningrad, at that time.
Q: Mm-hm, exactly.
A: But one f— another was big — big move from Pilzzeit(ph) to Tauragé, Siauliai,
[indecipherable] Riga, and farther away into Estonia. And Panevézys is in
between. So they were fleeing toward north, not toward the east. Of course, toward
the east the Germans were already advancing there. They fled to — reached Latvia,
Jékabpils, which is on the Daugava river. And so that on the other side of Daugava
are — the German tanks are going. Apparently — the communists apparently, for
instance, this communist who lived in our house, de — he survived. He — he e — he
escaped.

Germans and — and hanged by the Germans. And so he — he escaped, but then of

course was thrown back as a paratrooper. But my f — but the young friends from the
communist youth thought it’s — 1t’s hopeless. They said that they threw their rifles
into the Daugava river, and walked back to Panevézys. Well, it took couple of
weeks, I guess, until they arrived back. Nobody was interested, nobody bothered
them, nobody enquired about them, nothing. If they wouldn’t have fled, they would
have shot. They would have killed.
Q: They would have been killed.
A: The first — first day, yeah. Such people like them, they were killed first day, no
questions asked. What a difference two weeks made. Nobody was interested, nobody
even asked them where they were.
Q: Or who they were.
A: Or who they were, yeah. They lived just normal life. One of them’s living in
Klaipéda now, raising his family, that’s — he was Russian, yeah, ethnic Russian.
Yeah, so.
Q: So, you — you fired not a single shot from your rifle?
A: Not a single shot.

heard that they had been implicated in murders —

A: Right.
Q: What is it that you heard, and did you know of these people personally?
A: Well, there’s the problem. I think when they were killing the people, they thought
they doing some kind of a heraic — heroic work. But they very quickly found out
that everybody looks very, you know, agains — ev-everybody’s we — very much
against that, and they condemned such a t — such a action. So they didn’t brag about
that any more, and so I just heard the rumors, yeah, from my class, about one, yes,
but it’s a rumor, he never talked about anything like that, so I— I don’t know. I can’t
accuse him, because this 1s terrible accusation, and well, he is killed. H-He 1s killed
by the — by the s — by the Soviets, but — on second occupation, he — they found his
remains in ter — what does — near Vilnius there, the burial place. But — but I don’t
know. Just a rumor about him.
Q: But when we’re talking about massacres, are we talking about massacres of Jews,
or are we talking about revenge shooting of communists, some of whom might be
Jewish, some of whom would not be?
A: I imagine that it’s — it’s killing of the communists.
Q: I see.
A: Yeah. Jews and not Jews. Definitely not Jews, because we know, I mean, who are
killed. As far as Jews are concerned, we didn’t have that many people so we identify,
you know, how many and where. I sa — would suspect that the Jews had the worst

chance to survive in the — than the Lithuanian communists. Well, Lithua — be — if
they decided to kill, I mean, there was no chance any more. You know, they decide,
this is a communist, let’s shoot him. And they shot — shot him. But I think they had
stupid errors, you know, of killing people who were not communists, could happen
for the Jews much easier, because —
Q: Of the suspicion?
A: Sus-Suspicion and not knowing the community that well. In Lithuanian case
pretty much well — was known who was, you know, wa — involved that much. So I
suspect that maybe more Jews. But anyway, they were not killed, there were not
mass executions like later. There were not executions of children, women. Well,
women, unless they themselves were implicated, but — but not like, you know, the
whole families or something like that. Just — just thought he’s a communist, a Jew a
communist, we’ll kill him, kill him. That’s my impression. I — I wasn’t close to those
things, I saw — well, it’s difficult to say, but it was definitely not — not a mass ex —
extermination of the Jews —

girls there, was nice. And the last day before I-I came home, we were walking
through his village. There were no buildings around, there were fields and roads, and
there came a man on a bicycle. And this man came to a — both of us and said, do you
know? Birzai Jews are — have been killed. We were shocked, I mean, wha-what —
what do you mean? He didn’t say hello or anything like that, that was the first words
he said, do you know?

said that they found, the Germans found that the Jews had hidden weapons, and
because of that, you know, he t — took all the Jews, and brought to someplace, you
know, outside the city, and they just killed all the Jews. All, he said. Children,
babies. The German officer was walking around and shooting babies in the mothers’
hands. Whether he participated or not, I don’t know, but he was shocked. At least he
was apparently guarding, or so. He was — he — eyewitness. No question about that.

they didn’t bring him to the — the ghetto, he still stayed at his home and his office.
And the Germans came to pick him up and bring with the other Jews, and he said no,
he is not going anywhere. And the — well, the German officer pulled out the pistol
and just shot him right there in his office. And thi-this is — they said, I mean, they

Germans were killing, Lithuanians were killing also there, the — those Jews, you
know, and he — he told him particularly he — the ch — the killing of the babies for him
you — was — was — was the thing, I mean, he just couldn’t — he said, after that, I
mean, he — he just resigned from — from the service, and he doesn’t want even to see.
Q: Was he a policeman?
A: Well, like auxiliary policeman at that time, not a regular in uniform or anything
like that, no. Tho-Those are — were not involved in — in — 1n usually in — in Jews’
execution. But that was — we were shocked also, hearing that. And we thought that’s
— it’s a unique thing, as I read in Napoleon’s biography right before going there, you
know. Th — having time I just picked up a book and read Napoleon’s biography.
And there is an incident where Napoleon killed the prisoners of war in — in
Akah(ph), in — in — today Israel, at that time Turkish Palestine. And even, I
thought, I mean, even — even Napoleon, whe — really a reasonable military leader, he
did things, and I thought well, BirZai will be also in history like Jaffa, you know,
some cruelty which happens during the war, you know, without any reason,
something — well, what do you mean, I mean Jews were hiding weapons. Maybe
they were hiding weapons, but somebody prepared even the ditches for the — for the
— for th — for them to be killed, you know, before that. So s — must be just — just a
pretense. So, we — we thought that something what’s ha — what’s happened in

thing is going all around. And then we found out not only in Lithuania but in
Latvia also. Hm. Now — then we [indecipherable] we saw, in our gymnasium, in
ou-our high school came a German detachment, not the regular military, I don’t
know, the uniforms were somewhat different, they have digging equipment a lot, and
there was — they will kill Panevézys Jews also, the rumor was there. And of course
we believed because we knew what happened in BirZai. It was terrible. By the way,
I bir — didn’t mention how the ge — ghetto was established, fairly early, but not the
first day, not e — not even the first week. The Germans had all kinds of
announcements, and telling what to do, return the weapons, this, that, you know, all
kinds of things, and u-underneath it was — my friends said, you know, if — if it’s not

Q: We’ll be shot.
A: — yeah, we’ll shot. Not — not worth even reading, but if it says we’ll shot, at least
I read it. But there was another announcement with — not in German format,
establishing a ghetto in Panevézys, and requiring to wear this yellow star. Not to
walk on the sidewalks, all this thing. I cannot remember, I’m sorry I can’t remember
who signed that, whether it was a Lithuanian mayor, or was a German officer, I
cannot remember who — who is — un-under whose authority was written — although I

[indecipherable]
Q: It doesn’t matter.
A: But doesn’t matter, but I don’t know in Panevézys, under whose authority it was
announced. And the ghetto was established. At the beginning, the idea of ghetto
didn’t seem such terrible, because we thought about medieval ghettos. Jews living
separately, but well, we imagined, you know, we knew that there were ghettos in
Poland already. We — we imagined that there — I mean, the Jews are — had in there,
their establishments, professionals, you can go there, buy things with th — from the
Jews. You can go to the doctor, Jewish doctor, you can go to the lawyer. And then
[indecipherable] they live just separately. So, not that bad. But when the ghetto was
established, it wasn’t the medieval ghetto, it was — everybody was crowded in, in the
small place, tak — they didn’t work in their professions, they had to work outside,
you know, s-simple some — digging or something.
Q: Did you see people being moved into the ghetto?
A: No, I didn’t see that. I saw people that were working on — on the street with the

Maybe the Jews did wrong things, maybe they deserved some kind of punishment,
but this — this was too much. And there was a organization, I know, because my
mother knows her — he — she wasn’t pa-part of the organization, but her good friend,
this doctor I talked, Dr. Bridges, who talked with the Jewish doctors about, you
know, the action of the young Jews during Soviet occupation, his wife, and other,
mostly from Catholic organizations, made a — a circle to help the Jews in the ghetto.
First of all, there was not enough food for them. There was some food, but not
enough. So thif — that’s first thing what they get for, you know, to — to bring food to
the ghetto. Ghetto was guarded by Li-Lithuanian au-auxiliaries.

execution. And the rumor went around that tomorrow the Jews will be killed. First of
all, I heard about that from thos — these auxiliaries. Some of th-those auxiliaries
came to my friends and said, we are not going to kill anybody. We are not killers, we
are not going to kill anybody. If they force me for such — into some executions, we
are going to — to flee from the service. And they asked my friends, you know,
whether we could arrange for them to hide until they could go out of the city toward
their villages, and hide there, but right now where — when they ha — when they
escape from this. So apparently — by the way, h-here the Bishop of Panevézys comes
in. He also heard those rumors and in one Sunday — I wasn’t 1n — in the ch — in the
church, it’s — I regret at the time, not a direct witness, but the whole city was talking
about that, that the bishop s — talked about thou sho — shall not kill, and he really
condemned those who’d kill innocent people, and excommunicated them in advance.
Those who kill innocent people, or you have killed innocent people he
excommunicated and — and condemned them, not by name, because some of them
that just didn’t do that yet. But, as a — as a category of people, of — of killers. And —
Q: And he was talking about the massacre of the Jews, the ongoing massacre of the
Jews?
A: Yes, and other innocent people, but —
Q: Okay.

A: — but he was talking about the Jews. No — nobody had any doubt, including the
Germans, because the Germans reacted. They arrested the bishop, put in — in — in the
house arrest, and said that he is removed from his — from his duties, and he has to
leave Panevézys altogether. Okay, so he left Panevézys altogether. He had the villa
in Berciunai, a few kilometers from Panevézys, and — a small resort, and he went to
his vil — to this villa. But he didn't resign from a bishop’s duties, he — from the villa
he just did his old work as a bishop. And Lithuanian administration covered it up,

A: Casimiras Paltarokas. And so —
Q: So did these — did these auxiliaries who came and asked to be hidden until they
could return to their villages, did that succeed? Were they able to run away?
A: No. [asked after this — this thing, you know, my friends wer — did they? No, they
said, they didn’t need to. There was no — no need. There were enough, those who
went willingly, and those who refused were left alone, but all of them resigned from
the service then, because we have — they didn’t want to be associated even with this
— the killers, the people. So th — at least in Panevézys there was no — no — well,

in — in executions.
Q: So, in other words, those Lithuanians who did participate —
A: Did willingly.
Q: — did it willingly.
A: Apparently yeah, that’s — that’s the conclusion.
Q: And when di — do you remember what month the executions started, when the
Panevézys Jews were liquidated?
A: I di—I don’t remember now. I have on my — on my memoirs —

was a quiet place, and — until the Germans took over, and —
Q: Did you see — after those rumors, wasn’t it true that actually the next day that
happened, or the few days afterwards it happened — I mean, in other words, were the
rumors fulfilled?
A: Which way?
Q: I mean, there — sometimes one can hear that there are rumors and it doesn’t
happen that week, it happens the week after.
A: No, no, it happened that, because it — there were — they brought — they were
telling a story, they brought Russian prisoners of war to dig the ditches for that. And
when they gave the dimensions of the ditches, the Russians threw — threw off their —
their shovels and they refused. Because they were Soviet, people they knew, that’s —
that’s for their — for execution. And they assumed for them.
Q: Oh.
A: And the Germans finally tell them that that’s for Jews, not for you. They didn’t
believe it. They didn’t believe it. They had to take their equipment, whatever, dig the
ditches themselves, or hired sa — I don’t know, but the Russians wouldn’t do that.
Q: Interesting.

street where the road was leading toward Pajuoste where the executions were taking

Q: Did you see this?
A: Yes. And to his — with my class friend, we just looked, and didn’t say anything.
Didn’t say anything because what — what can you say? What can you say?

forgotten by that time, long ago. When the Jews were brought into the ghetto, you
know, the Lithuanians, th-that — that was the end. The Lithuanians didn’t — didn’t
approve of that; a ghetto as it was established there, didn’t approve of that, and so —
but yeah, that’s — that is a terrible, a terrible thing. Yeah, we — we went then, after
the execution, oh several, several weeks after the execution, and we went to a farm
where one of our friends had the girlfriend 1-in that farm. The farm was nearest farm
to the execution place. And we wanted to find out. We — we knew, I mean, it — it was
a horrible thing happened of a gur — tremendous significance. Wanted to find out
wa-wa — wh-what — what it was. And they said well, the girl couldn’t tell us anything
because when the executioner cames, the fa — th-the — the parents, they say, hid her.
Told her to go upstairs, you know, and the — and to hide, and because those — the
killers were going around the co — the house drinking water, vodka, everything. But
we didn’t really, in such a detail as this from BirZai told, there was nothing —
nothing — nothing. The same thing, the same Germans and Lithuanians. German
officer also killing, you know, babies. Apparently still there’s some resistance of the
executioners to kill babies, so the officer had to take them up on himself. I’m just — I
suppose, that — that’s my deduction. The story was told that, you know, one
Lithuanian officer was married to a j — Jewish girl, and when the Jews were brought
to the ghetto, he went together with her. Lived together with her, and when they

brought to the execution, he went together with her. And he was told, you know, to
go out — go away, you know. He refused, he went with his wife and was killed there.
Q: So you got as close as to the farm next to the execution site?
A: Right, yeah, wa — the group of us.
Q: The group of us. But you didn’t go to the execution site?
A: Nah, no.
Q: No.
A: No. Then they said, you know, at the end of the ex-execution it looked like they
became insane. They were drinking vodka, complaining that th-they — they cannot
get drunk, you know, no matter how much vodka they drink. And at the end, you
know, it was starting g-getting at dusk, you know. And some of them started going —
the — the Jews had to disrobe, they will start going through their — within they had
hidden some — some valuables there, some gold or whatever, some started going
through those — their — their — their clothes. And one of them, of the executioners,
one of them said that you’re not supposed to that, you know, that’s — that’s supposed
to leave, you know, for the — for the — for the — the Germans, you know, to take care
of it. So what they did, they just shot him and threw him together with the Jews in
the — in the — 1n the — in th — 1n the ditch. Now, this is true — true story, because about
year, or — or couple of years ago, my friend came to me and said, you know —
wanted to check with me his translation of a request of a mother of those — that who

was killed there. He was asked — she was — wanted to translate into German, was
asking the German authority to let dig up the grave, find the remains of her son and
remove it and bring it to — to its — a regular cemetery. So, I saw that — that letter,
which my friend has translated, we looked at the translation. So I — I doubt very
much a German would have approved that, I don’t know what happened with that
story, but apparently that story is right.
Q: So that means the one who was there, who was saying you can’t go through the
clothes —
A: Right.
Q: — this was his mother.
A: That’s right.
Q: I see.
A: That’s right.
Q: How many Jews were there in PanevéZys’? Do you know, approximately? Are we
talking 10,000, are we talking —
A: No, about s-s 7,000 - 8,000, something less than 10,000 I would say.
Q: And in BirZai, did you have an idea?

the municipality of Panevézys. We see Germans introduce the food — food cards.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: We were supposed to get that much food, you know, for — and the — this —
everybody had to get those cards. Now, it’s tremendous operation, you know, every
people have to get those cards in PanevéZys. Tremendous lines and — and lots of
time. So they hired people, I was one of them, and many of my friends, to bring
those to the people. We got those food cards, we had lists of people who live and
how many, and we were bringing those cards to the people themselves, so they
wouldn’t waste time getting those cards. So it was very interesting because I knew
pa — pa — got to know Panevézys as never before. You know, all kinds of people
from all professions, all — all social levels, you know, all nationalities, except the
Jews. Except the Jews. Yeah. And so I brought those cards. Most of the people, you
know, just signed for it, a-and I go to the next house and so on. But some of the
people were talkative. And — and some — and all — not always, but many of the

people were bringing up this — the execution of the Jews, and all negative. I suppose
that those who were for it, wouldn’t start the discussion at all. I just met one who —
who was that, you know.
Q: In the bringing of these cards around you mean, or in general you just met one
person?
A: He — he — he — he — let me see, did I bring a— a cards? Exactly thinking, I think I
was bringing the cards, but he was outside, or he was visiting that fa-family, and I
didn’t give him the cards, just the regular — the residents. And I don’t know, he was
officer in Lithuanian army or — or what, I don’t remember his — his profession, but
he said that his — he was one of those, when the deportations started who — who ran
away to hide because he thought th-they are coming for him. And his family was
deported. He — hi-his wife and two daughters. And he was convinced that the Jews
were in that group, and he said he is going to — to participate in killing of the Jews.
But I doubt very much, because he was telling when the Jews in Panevézys were
already killed, so he had to go to Vilnius or Kaunas, you know, where the
executioners were still working. I doubt very much whether he did that, but I don’t
know, I don’t know.
Q: But his sentiment was there. In other words, he had that —
A: Right.

Q: And yet, with the people that — who you did have start such conversations, they
were still in some shock?
A: Yes, yes, yes. And th-that’s why they brought up the subject, they just — just
couldn’t — couldn’t hold, they just wanted to — to — to speak about it.
Q: So all this happened in the first several months after the German invasion?
A: Right.
Q: And after the German occupation, and we have another three years, or another
two and a half years of — of German occupation, Nazi occupation of Lithuania.
Anything in those next couple of years occur that was also related to the Holocaust,
to the Jewish community, that you came across in your life at that time, or was it
pretty much over by the fall of 1941?
A: In Panevézys was over, because no Jews were left, unless somebody hid some of
the Jews, which happened, as we found out later. At that time nobody w-was
bragging about it. So — but I went to Vilnius, to study in Vilnius and there were

so isolated that we didn’t know what’s going on in there. We knew that it — we saw
some of the Jews being driven to some kind of work. We knew they were, some of
them, working in the factories, one factory came up in flames because it seems
[indecipherable] there sabotage, because they were working for the German army,
for the — getting the cur — th-the furs, you know, for the winter.
Q: Right.
A: Yeah, so Kailis factory. So, but we d — we knew that executions were going on in
Paneriai. From time to time they were taking out there and — and being killed. We
knew that some of the Jews escaped. Escaped — not only those which were hidden,
but escaped into the forests in vil — in Vilnius area and in Kaunas area, I don’t know
in other ci-cities. And there joined the Soviet guerillas, Soviet partisans, which the
movement, at that time, you know, th-the — the Soviet planes were parachuting some
of leaders and weapons. And th-there was that movement of the Soviet partisans, es-
escaped prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war escaped. Some of the Lithuanian
communists wer — survived, and the Jews who escaped from the ghettos. Now, at
that time there was Lithuanian resistance movement against the Germans, there was
underground press going out, letters, and even at that time I noticed one thing. That
our press, underground press was reporting what the ger — Germans were doing with
the Jews. If they killed, you know, thousand or s — or — or — or — or so Jews in
Kaunas, there was a— a—a-—a notice, a report. There were reports about Jewish

guerillas, the Soviet guerillas, but there was no judgment. And even speaking with
the people, they didn’t, most of the pe — they didn’t speak about those things, but if
there was — they spoke about the Jewish guerillas, I — I didn’t meet anybody who
would condemn them. At that time it was clear that they were fighting, that was the
only chance to fight for their life. So, ba — what — what — nobody see how — how you
can condemn them. They were on the other side, they were enemies. Our Lithuanian
s-security forces, auxiliaries were fighting against go — Soviet guerillas, also against
the Jewish Soviet guerillas, but not because they’re Jew, because they were fighting
against the Soviets. Well, that was, the war was going on, Lithuanians were fighting
Polish guerillas also. But there were no — there was not — not that, as a div — during
the first occupation, where there was that resentment. There was no resentment.
They were on the other side, they were like — like enemy, which you do not

east Prussia, not from Klaipédos, but even farther, Tilzé and all that, they f — they
were, you know, fled from Nazis to Lithuania in Vilnius, they arrested and
executed them in Austai(ph) Paneriai also.
Q: And the reason was because of activities, or because of —
A: Oh, activities, they were pu-publishing in Lithuanian newspaper, Lithuanian
books. Well, of course, that was all over, because they had to flee from the Nazis and
they came to Lithuania. And — but the tils — Tilzés — Tilzés — Tilszin(ph) Gestapo

Q: 1943.
A: — 1943, which was another turning point, I was very much aware, and most of the
people were aware that this a turning point. After Stalingrad we thought maybe, you
know, there might be somebody if — if the Germans throw the Hitler away, or
something may — some — but most likely Germans have lost the war. So, Germans
also realized that they are in bad shape now. So they decided oh, Lithuanians wanted
to fight against the Soviets, okay, so let’s call Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians,
they established Waffen SS legions for those countries and drafted the young men
into those Waffen SS legion. Estonian [indecipherable] legion, and Latvian, two
divisions. Estonian, one division, Latvian, two divisions. And Lithuanian,
Lithuanians just boycotted. Nobody really, excepts few invalids reported to the
induction center. Well, they became so angry, they closed the universities, because
they realized that the students were behind it, and they arrested the — you know, s — I
don’t know, about 50, maybe less people very known in Lithuania. P-Priests,
professors, even their administrators who worked on that dam, high administrators
and brought them to the concentration camp in Stutthof, near Danzig. And all the
other oppressions, you know, your — even — even — even farmers and so al-al-also.
So, once that started — well, I d—I don’t want to go into lo — long details, but I — I
wa — I became sick with a pneumonia and was in the hospital and I was discharged
for pneumonia. And the Germans took a list of discharged people and drafted us.

And I saw that’s — it’s really a sad situation. So I thought that the only thing I have,
if I don’t want, you know, that my family will suffer [indecipherable] for that, I — I
would rather collec — select, you know, where do I am going under the Germans.
And I selected so-called Reichsarbeitsdienst. A Reichs labor service, which all the
Germans had to — to go through before going into the military service, but also the
girls had to go through that. So I w —I volunteered for that, not wanting to go
anywhere else. My resistance leader approved of that.

advantageous to — to — to — to be on that side [indecipherable]
Q: So you were an anti-German resistance —
A: I was.
Q: — as an anti-Nazi resistance [indecipherable]
A: Right, right, yes. So my leader acce — a-approved of that, and I went into the
arbeitsdienst. I served for, not the full term. I don’t know why, they let us go
earlier. And we came to Lithuania. We knew that, you know, the German —
Q: Were you — excuse me, I’m sorry to interrupt. You weren’t in Lithuania at that

A: We — we work in Peenemiinde, we were in several places, but I
[indecipherable] in Peenemiinde where the German rockets were being built, you
know [indecipherable] and — and the other. And Mr. Brown was there, you know, I
— we saw him.
Q: You did? You saw him?
A: Y-Yeah, well, just fleeing, you know, he was walking through there. So, was —
was — German were very correct about that. Apparently they wanted to create some
friendly people for them, you know. Was — was no-not bad at all. And the Germans
wo — took — but we were working together with the Germans, mixed together with
the Germans, and they were young boys, but friendly. So, was not a bad experience.
Wa-— one — bu-but then we were released from that service earlier, before our term
was over, because there was supposed to be Lithuanian army, you know, armed
forces be — being established, and the general said that he needs some experienced
soldiers who could be un — you know, non-commissioned off — officers, something
like that.

Germans, you know, came in conflict with Lahavichos(ph) for many aspects. They
di — didn’t hold with their agreements. Lahavichos(ph) was a very strong, a very s-
stubborn and proud man. We loved him, all the soldiers loved him, he was a real
leader. So the Germans arrested him, his staff, as I said, and disbanded this — this
unit and executed some of them. We were let go earlier, so I lived in my aunt’s
house in — in the village. And then the Russians approached Lithuania, pretty soon
they took Vilnius, was a-approaching Kaunas and I decided, you know, that I— I’m
not going to wait for them. Some who mo — my friends ask me to, you know, join
them as guerrilla fighters against the Soviets. I didn’t believe in that, I thought
maybe two, three months, not more, you know. I didn’t believe that the west will
fight for Lithuania. I decided I go west, and try, you know, to — to meet it, the
western English, or Americans in Germany, because this was obvious Germany
lost the war, that was clear.
Q: Did your parents go with you?
A: No. My mother wanted to go with me, well there was confusion, a lot of
confusion. And my pa — father wanted, you know, he was too late. Panevézys was
taking without any — any ba-battle. Germans just demolished electrical plant and
retreated without any ac — without any resistance. So my father stayed in Lithuania.
My mother eventually went to Germany also, but separately form — from myself. I

went to Germany, also, we met at the end of war. I met my mother in Munich, and
well, I must tell y — if I tell the full story, so I went to the east Prussia.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: We were sent to work together with the farmers, to — to help the farmers.
Apparently, also, before the evacuation, 1t was clear that the Russians will go in —
inside. So we were working at the farm, and then suddenly was told everybody has
to go to dig ditches against the tanks, to make obstacles to the Soviet tanks coming
in. And a lot of Lithuanians, Poles, everything, you know, were brought together,
and who were just digging those anti-tank ditches. Which didn’t help any,
apparently, later. We were in — in the — in the rather famous — we later fa — became
famous in the — or infamous really. A village nomar -- Nemmersdorf —
Q: Oh yeah.
A: Well, yeah, what — Soviets e-e-executed a lot of Germans. All of them, really,
who were left there, so — who were digging those — those anti-tank ditches. Now, one
afternoon, you know, after — after lunch, we were — a break, you know, were eating
our lunch and suddenly we noticed that SS troopers have surrounded us all around.
And they took out their automatic weapons and one of them came forward. And in
very good Lithuanian language, very good, with no accent, nothing, said that we
Lithuanians are all communists, we should be shot right away. We didn’t fight to
defend our own country, and we deserve to die row — right here and now. But, the

fuehrer is so great in — in his — you know, that he decided to let us — to — I mean, to
w-wer — to fight f — for the Germany in this way, you know, of our — our shame,
that we didn’t defend our country, that we are basically communists at heart, who let
us, you know, wer — you know — well, anyway, to — to — to — to — to — to parole us
from this.
Q: Expiate — expiate your sin —
A: Right.
Q: — 1n other words.
A: Expiate my sin. So, and this — so. we will be drafted now in the German army as
auxiliaries in the Luftwaffe. And wh-who doesn’t, you know, doesn’t appreciate
fuehrer’s great move, you know, well, we will know about that, how to handle it.
Okay, so — so we became German soldiers. Soldiers, no, auxiliaries. No rank,
nothing like that. They [indecipherable] gave us uniforms, but without any rank
indications, any insignia, and we were aus — auxiliaries. We were supposed to do
work, we were digging trenches against the sw — Swedes in Stralsund in Germany.
Stralsund because the Germans at that time thought that Sweden’s will — going to
join the allies and attack them in the north. So we were digging those trenches after
that, you know, the Swedes didn’t attack, so they brought us as other tasks. But they
were manual tasks, and electrical work, you know, something like that. I don’t know
whether to tell the story, I — I — I — because — are we running out of time?

A: Yeah, well — well, anyways, well after the war, I met my — my mother. I didn’t go
into the prisoner of war, I just deserted from the Germans. I didn’t feel that I owe

Then I worked in textile, and after I st-studied here and completed my studies in
University of Connecticut, I — and then in New York University Business School,
then I worked for the government. I worked in the postal service as an economist,
making analyses of new equipment, of new buildings, economic analyses in that
field, and worked until I retired. And after that, a short time, I worked in Lithuanian
mission at the United Nations, when Lithuania became independent. They didn’t
have any diplomats, and Mr. Simutas(ph), who was appointed ambassador at the
United Nations, asked me to join his staff.
