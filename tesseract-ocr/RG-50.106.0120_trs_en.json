Could be if I would really fight, and wanted very much, I would go, but the upbringing was totally different than it is now of young people. And I was two years in law school, which I didn\u2019t finish because it was in subject that it was ancient law and middle age law which appealed to me. And then for a \u2014 before the war started, I was helping my father in his factory, where I was typing a little bit, doing some bookkeeping, but nothing to get excited.

However, since I was accepted to law school, and in the beginning I thought maybe I\u2019Il be a law-lawyer, and \u2014 however when the instructor professor was coming to the class and you know, the Jews were sit \u2014 standing behind the benches and he said still, the Jewish student will not sit on the left hand side, I will not start the lecture. And he was leaving, and this was right away totally chaos in the class because the Christian were beating up immediately the Jewish male students. The women they didn\u2019t touch.
