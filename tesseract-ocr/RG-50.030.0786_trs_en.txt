Q: Did you — do you have any memory —
A: That’s the way the war turned out.
Q: I see. Do you have any memories of him?

my parents were in the process of diso — divorce, anyway.
Q: When you were little?
A: Hm’?
Q: They — were they in the process of divorce before the war?
A: Well, that’s what I had been told.
Q: I see.
A: Those things were too — too — let’s say serious matters to be discussed with the
child that’s five or six.
Q: Yeah.
A: And I don’t know too much, and later on things just were different. We were —
mother and I were in refugee concentration camps, being shifted here and there,

Q: Before we get there, to those s — experiences of being refugees, I still want to
talk a little bit about your very first years.
A: My very first —
Q: First years.
A: Where?
Q: In Grodno.
A: Oh, in Grodno.
Q: So —
A: Well, how could I tell you very much?
Q: Well, I'll ask some questions.
A: Oh, okay.
Q: Okay. So, before the war started, did all three of you live in the same place;
your mother, your father and yourself?
A: Well, that was th-the property that my mother inherited, and she — she was in
the process of starting a berry and fruit gardens.
Q: Oh really? What kind of — tell me a little bit about your mother’s family. Your
grandparents and the larger family. What kind — did they — were they well-to-do?
A: I can tell you only that I had a picture in my mind of a family portrait of my
mother, a very stately, white collar laces, and very po — but that’s was — that what I

[indecipherable] that that portrait was stolen in Russia with the few belongings
we had, and that’s all I can tell you. I don’t remember even my grandmother, and
she was supposedly looking after me for a while.
Q: Really? And you have no memory of her?
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: Just that photograph.
Q: Okay. What kind of a place did you live in? Was it a large apartment, or a
house?
A: The house was in a country where the — mother’s property was. That was
outside Grodno.
Q: Was it — did it have a lot of land?
A: She didn’t have a lot of land, you know, ma — eight — maybe 80 acres or
something.
Q: Eighty acres?
A: Something — something not — not very big, but she — I think she — she was the
one that directed the arrangement for the g-gardens, and —
Q: Okay.
A: It was still the sa — somewhat in the process of being formed, anyway, at that
time, and this is — here is the beginning of the war, too.

January 23, 2015
Q: Yeah. But 80 acres, if we’re talking about eight-zero, that’s a lot of acreage.
A: Well, I— I don’t know exactly hectares, and —
Q: Ah, do you remember how many hectares?
A: No, I don’t remember.
Q: Okay.
A: But I think it’s listed somewhere. I don’t remember exactly.
Q: The reason I focus on this, because I want to get a sense of whether your
mother’s family were landowners.
A: Oh, this was the la — the la — that property was given by the government
because of mother’s brother be — taking part in a Polish ri — let’s see, the rise of
that territory, because remember, Poland was divided be-before that.
Q: And divided in what way?
A: Well, div-divided de-depending which — how shall I say? Which — there is a
Polish word, and an English word, and I can’t — Poland was divided —
Q: It was partitioned?
A: — by its borders. Borders were shifted.
Q: I see.

German.

Q: And you were — Grodno was in which part of the — part te — part of the
territory, of those three places?
A: As far as I know, on the — it was Russian.
Q: I see. And then, does that mean that your mother’s brother took part in some
kind of battles, or some kind of —
A: Well, he — he wa — he de-deserved some compensation from the government,
because he put — he was in that category of helping the — those that fought for the
liberation of Poland.
Q: Thank you. That’s what I wanted to understand, how it is that he got some land.
So that meant he fought for Polish independence during and after the first World
War. Is that correct?
A: Yeah, mm-hm.
Q: Okay. Okay. And so the land was then given to him.
A: Well, th-the land could — given to the mother’s parents. After they passed
away, they simply — he, and the brother died —
Q: I see.
A: And mother was the owner.
Q: So does that mean she had no other bro-brothers and sisters, just the one
brother?
A: The all — sh — there was a sister also, that she also died.

you ever play outside in those orchards, where she was going to grow berries?
Where she was going to make a business?
A: Well, she — are you asking me if they were planning to — to — to start the

there?

that we still had were put on the sleigh, and we were marched off to the railway
station.
Q: Do you have any idea why they came to arrest you?
A: You didn’t need that. The Russians needed free labor, and this was a free labor.
Q: But why you, why your mother? I mean, what can a five year old child do with
free labor?
A: Well, that’s — you can ask. And I — I never had any explanation that was
logical.
Q: So you didn’t know.
A: We didn’t — we didn’t participate in any political uprisings, or whatever, right
now. We tried to simply live, and survive on what we still had. But the — the
Russian command decided that they wanted additional thing, they wanted our
labor force.
Q: Well, one of the reasons I asked about the land earlier, is that sometimes —
A: The mark?
Q: About your land, how much land your mother had.

Q: So, did your father find out what happened to you?
A: We didn’t hear from him.
Q: Do you — was he deported eventually too, or does he — you — the next time you
see him, he’s in England. Was he arrested by anybody”?
A: In Poland”?
Q: Your father, yes.
A: He wasn’t arrested, he — in Russia, about halfway through the war, Stalin and
Hitler’s got at each other’s throats. And that time it was — you se — you were

Polish units were formed, and supposedly we lost con — total contact with him.

A: There was —
Q: Correct.
A2: So they were not together when they — she — they were arrested. Somehow he
ended up — he was a soldier too, with that same — that her uncle — our uncle was
fighting in. So he also — he would have been arrested for being a soldier in — in the
Pilsudski’s army, essentially. And — and then, when he got to the labor camp, they
were — they weren’t together, but they were there in that camp, but they weren’t
together. And then, shortly afterwards, what she’s talking about, he — he got in —
he went to prison, and then when Hitler attacked Russia, they were — he was let
go, just like my father was let go, and into that Polish army. So she doesn’t really
know how he got to the labor camp.

your mother must have had an un — incredible hard life there.

Q: They didn’t. I see.
A: They — we found out, or at least I was told that they — the residents of the camp
found out, when this guy came in from prison, after he was released.

A: Well, it was in that general area. There was a push of units in the camps, going
south. So the next one would be out of — out of Russia, was the Caspian Sea, we
were taken on the boat, we went — ended up in Persia.

much. But I remember it from the fact that my shoes were stolen. We had to walk
on sand, and this was very hot sand. And I suffered something ou — terrible. I
would step a few steps and Mother had to put something on the ground so I could
cool my feet.

much. On our journey from this northern part to — to southern territory in Russia, I

those were stables that the Germans kept the horses in. This was now a rather hot
season, in a hot country. Every noon or so, there was a sandstorm.
Q: Every day?
A: Almost every day, and it was so unusual for us, we couldn’t breathe almost. We
had to — we went th-the clean sheets that we had and covered ourselves and just

A: In Britain.
Q: I see. Is there anything else, Mira, that I have not asked you, that you think is
important for people to know, about your story?
A: There was an incident about the goats. After work Mother went to the edge of
the camp, and cut down those young twigs that just sprout out leaves. And at that
time she used to sing, she used to — to tell me — taught me — well, I guess, the
poem. I d—I don’t remember the — that — the author, whatever, but anyway, we —
we were playing, the kids were playing hide and seek or something, and I — I was
with them. They started to go — go on the loft. Well, going back to the problem
what Mother was doing, making bundles of these twigs to feed the goat, 1t was po
— essential that you don’t shake the — the bundles, because the leaves would fall
off, and the goats wouldn’t get any food. So you had — Mother make me be —
listen very carefully, and not a-allow, or t-talk to the kids, not to go and play on —
in the loft. Well, one time the kids made comments about this and that. Finally,

one said, oh, to the ghost, that they — that they heard noises, whatever, like finally
one of them says — says, oh, if we ta — say a prayer, it will all right.
Q: Okay, so they thought that —
A: So we started saying a prayer, but the boy — I don’t know which prayer it was,
but anyway, they started saying a prayer, and I was saying the same ti — prayer,
but I— I was thinking so hard, how am I going to stop all those kids going up
there. Finally, I decided not — not to say a prayer.

Q: Okay. This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Danuta Soletski(ph) Urbikas, on January 23", 2015. And Danuta, I want you to
tell us a little bit about how you are related to Mira, and how you have come to
know about her story. So.
A: So, Mira and I have the same mother. My mother met my father in that whole
turmoil during World War II, after he was released from the prisoner of war camp,
and she and Mira were released from — well, they escaped actually, from the labor
camp. And it was in Tatishchevo, near Saratov, where was the first Polish army
camp that was being gathered from all the soldiers that had remained, that hadn't
been murdered in the Soviet Union. So they met there briefly, and they actually
met again later on in Jelibod(ph), which was in Uzbekistan, or I don’t know, it’s
on the border, near Tashkins(ph). Tashkins(ph) was another area where the
Polish army had gone, and this is maybe 1500 miles or more away from
Tatishchevo, or near Saratov.
Q: Okay. So I would like to — for us to trace. I mean, some of the things that I
asked Mira, she didn’t remember where she wa — you know, what the towns were,
and so on. And tell me, how is it that you know all of these places?
A: Well, my mother talked about these experiences the whole time I was growing
up. And they were rather in disjointed sequence. So when I had my first child, she

agreed to put it all in order, with the help of my father. And so we embarked on
this project to get it in chronological order, and get the geography right, and the
history. And I started writing a book about it. And I did lot of research, and you
know, interviewed my parents, mostly my father, and also other historians who
were aware of — of this migration, this whole journey of these people that had been
deported.
Q: Okay, so I'd like to start from — from the beginning at least, but we’ll run
through it, okay?
A: Okay.
Q: So, Mira was born in Grodno, and that was in what part of Poland’?
A: That at the time was eastern Poland. Today it is Belarus, right on the border
really, with Lithuania and — and not too far from where the current border of
Poland is.
Q: Okay. And from Grodno, do you know what deportation they were taken on?
Was it the February one?
A: The February 10" one, yes, in 1940.
Q: Okay. And where were they taken to?
A: They were taken first to a camp at — across the Urals, which would have been
technically Siberia. And I’m trying to remember the — one was Mikelinska(ph),
do you remember that name? And the other one, I am drawing a blank.

Q: Okay.
A: But they were first there for maybe a few months, and this was in winter. And
then they were taken back to another camp near Perm, which is of Molotov. And
that was where they really were for the duration of the time in the — in the labor
camp.
Q: So Perm was a pretty tough place.
A: Mm-hm.
Q: The — some of the stories that Mira shared with us today, are they ones that
you are familiar with, that you had heard about before?
A: Oh yes, I grew up with these stories, you know, but — you know, these were
things that were discussed, especially at — during holiday times, or whenever our
Polish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories,
and they would start to talk about all these things. Or just Sunday dinners, you
know, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. Especially my
mother. You know, my father talked about it, but my mother was very — you
know, she — she wo — she went through so much, you know?
Q: So, if I can repeat a little bit, just to make sure that I’m clear about, she had to
work as a lumberjack?
A: Right. She was fairly tall for a Polish person, maybe not as tall as I am, but she
was, you know, generally speaking, the — the Soviets took people who were

working in the country to do the harder jobs, because they were honed better. And
the people who were in the cities were doing lighter work. And as Mira was
saying, there was no one else f — to work for them. It was just my mother. And so
they came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the
forest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they
felled, and — and yes, there was one occasion when she — I don’t know, you know,
she was so tired by then, and — and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated
by the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving
Mira, that she didn’t end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. And — and so this
tree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they — and
watched this tree coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a
pile of rubble, and the — the branches from this rubble actually cut the —
Q: Broke the —
A: — broke the fall. So she — she was in there, and they thought — the Soviets, the
brigadier, the supervisor of the — of the work team thought she was trying to kill
herself, you know. And so they got mad at her for — for, you know, doing that.
And so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up
getting ga new job working — fixing — changing the oil on tractors, and also filling
— there was one steam tractor that she had to fill water. And she got paid more for
that. But, you know, in the co — in the course of all of that, you know, she di — she

almost did end up in jail, because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the
Soviets, especially the — the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or
Byelorussian’s that were the supervisors in these barracks. And she would sing
Polish patriotic songs, and you know, just really — she kind of did things that
didn’t help her, you know, and that’s another thing that happened. So when she
went to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were — they were just — you
know, it was kind of vengeance from that particular barracks supervisor that didn’t
like her.
Q: Okay. I wanted to get a sense of how this — how this developed, the context of
such a bizarre thing, to be taken to court for, you know, having hay.
A: Actually, there were two court incidences. One was the hay, and then there was
another one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten — like gone back to
get a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. And that one was
actually a much more serious one. But the first time I think they docked her for, I
think a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn’t getting
paid very much anyway. It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a
day. And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult.
Q: Okay. And did you ever know, or did she ever — was she ever told why she was
deported?
A: Because she was a landowner.

Q: That’s what I thought, that’s what I thought.
A: And — and also, I think they may have also known that her — they were still
married, even though they were separated, her husband was a — a soldier, you
know, he was sergeant in the army.
Q: Okay, okay. All right, so when it comes to 1941, and there’s the agreement
between the Polish government in exile, and the Soviet Union to release people
who had been citizens of Poland who had been deported, they learned about it
from a former prisoner, rather than officials.
A: Right, they — the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it
was somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about
this, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but
they weren’t — they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they
escaped.
Q: So tell me, this incident what — that Mira was talking about, where she would
be a Red Cross nurse, and Mira would be left in an orphanage, was this —
A: Well, that’s much later, actually.
Q: Oh, I see.
A: That’s much later. Yeah, at — when — when my mother and sister were escaped
from the labor camp, they made their way down the Volga. And this is that

made it to — oh, now I’m drawing a blank. I think Kra-Krasnovodsk, you think’?
A2: Kra-Krasnovodsk.
A: Krasnovodsk. And then they went from there, down the Caspian Sea to
Pahlevi, right? Or no, actually, I’m skipping something. There was a lo — there
was — all these people were coming off of these collective farms, or there — you
know, some of them were sent to collective farms, and more in labor camps. And
there was a huge mass of people, and they na — they didn’t know where to put
them. So in the southern Soviet Union, they were traveling by train back and
forth, trying to find a place to — to go. Finally they ended up getting out after that.
And in that turmoil, that’s when they met my father again, okay?
Q: I see.
A: So, because getting out of the Soviet Union already, things were much better
by then. There was a official, the British were helping to establish these
resettlement camps, and one was in Teheran, and that’s where my mother and
Mira were there. I’m not sure it was for as long as she says it was, but it was
many months. And my mother studied nursing at that point, in English. And so,
she did become a Red Cross nurse. And after that, they ended up in India, and
there were there as — as Mira said, you know, for several years, with my mother

being a nurse in the hospital for the orphanage, and Mira went to a convent school
that was set up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation.
Q: Okay. Now, let me go back to the Soviet Union a little bit. I want to get a sense
more of the geography. So from what I understand from you’re telling me, is that
the camp they ended up staying in was bet — was in Perm, the region of Perm.
A: Oh, the labor camp, yes.
Q: The labor camp. From there they escaped, and made their way to a river, where
they were in a steamboat, and then went down to Krasnovodsk, is that wh-where
you were saying?
A: They went to Tatishchevo.
Q: Tatishchevo.
A: Near as —
Q: And what is Tatishchevo?
A: It’s a city or town near Saratov.

Q: And what was his story, in brief? How did he end up there?

A: Yes.
Q: Okay.
A: Yes.
Q: And so how did he end up in Lithuania?
A: They were trying to protect the Augusta(ph) Forest canals, and — from the
Germans, and they were — 0-or no, maybe it was — I’m not sure now. I think it was
— no, it must have been the Russians that were there. And they got — they got
caught and — and sent to an internment camp in Lithuania. And from there they
were sent — he was sent to the camp in Kozelsk.

Q: — under the Soviets, excuse me.
A: Right, right.
Q: And — and he was not — he was not shot.
A: No, there was — hi — at the camp where he was at, there was evidence that these
officers were being sent somewhere, but they didn’t know where. And he was
taken, actually, to — they were going to build an airstrip or something up further
north, in the tundra, and — at Grazovietz they were stopped, because at that point
Germany had in — attacked Poland — I mean, Russia, and so they were camped
there for a while. And then, of course, the Polish government agreed, you know,
th-that — there was the agreement with the Soviets to form this Polish army.
A2: Armestu(ph).
A: It was ca — yeah, was —
Q: Yeah, an amnesty.
A: — the amnesty. And so then, from there, I — somehow he — you know, made his
way towards Tatishchevo, or Saratov.
Q: And how is it that he met Mira the first time?
A: Well, the story that I heard was that she was warming herself at this stove, and
my father came over, and he tried to give you some money, some rubles.
A2: Well, no, he’s th — I was holding up a box, a — a— a matchbox of some sort.
A: Okay.

A2: Well anyway, in that matchbox, Mother gave me pa — a pile of rubles, or
something like that, and sh-she told me to keep it with me, in case I got lost, or —
or d-don’t have anything to — to — that I would be able to buy some food.
Q: I see. Okay.
A2: And he — he put some more of his money into the box, and gave it to me. And
I refused to take it, Mother wouldn’t let me take it.
A: So instead of the rubles, he put some candy in there, remember?
A2: Yeah.
A: Okay, so he put some candy in this little box, and — and then you came back
another time, trying to meet up with him to get more candy, I think, or something.
A2: Oh, I think the — he — he earned some soldiers [indecipherable] bought kids
some sugar, and some honey.
A: Yeah. The soldiers always shared their rations with the civilians, especially the
children. And then my father, of course, because, you know, he had daughters that
were the same age. I’m sure he missed them terribly. And so Mira reminded him,
you know, of them.
Q: I see. And did he talk about this — these stories as well, and this incident?
A: Yeah, he did, yeah, he did.
Q: Okay, so when he met Mira the first time, and so on.
A2: Mm-hm.

Q: And then Mira introduced him to your mother.
A: Right. Well, as it’s — as she said, they we-were marching in formation for some
kind of maneuver, and she saw him and started running up to him, and you know,
he broke rank and came over, and met my mother.
Q: Okay.
A: Our mother.
Q: Yeah. And then, after the meeting at Tatishchevo, you Mira, and your mom,
went further south, 1s this it? Or you were on those trains that were going back and
forth?
A: Yeah, that was further south, and it was on those trains where they were trying
to find a place for all these refugees coming out of the camps. And that was really,
actually worse than the camps, because they were under bare skies, and it was
cold. By then it was, you know, November, December of ’41, and there was very
little food, and my mother was — our mother was trying to find, you know, food,
and there were various incidences that were just very horrifying. It was actually
much worse than the camp. But eventually they made it to another — you know, to
—to aresettlement camp. Actually, my father sent money — she — they say — I
don’t know how they managed to stay in mail contact, but our mother asked him
for s — help, because she really — they were so destitute, she — they had — they —
their luggage was stolen, this is the —

A2: Sh-She wrote a letter to the gi — center office of the — of the forming units.
She owned some scrap of torn paper, she managed to send that, and it got to your
father.
A: And he sent an incredibly large amount of money, which I’m sure he collected
from the other soldiers, of like 367 —
A2: Twenty — 300 some —
A: And it’s — 367’s the number I remember. Rubles. And it arrived, it got to my
mother and her. This 1s when she — they were both sick.
A2: Any money se — being sent by mail, it was a miracle we got that.
A: Yeah, it was — it was quite a miracle that that money got — and that really saved
them, because they — at that point my mother had a burlap bag for a dress, and
there was no food whatsoever, and they were in some pigsty. I mean, it was just
really very hard.
Q: So it sounds like it was almost the first kindness that she had received —
A: Well —
Q: — from all this — from all of these experiences.
A: Well, could — probab — the one that, course, stands out the most.
Q: Yeah.

Q: And then it was after that, and they got better, that — from where did they leave
the Soviet Union?
A: So they made it over to — oh, now I’m losing my train of thought here.

there, to Pahlevi.
Q: Which is in Iran.
A: Which is in Iran. And then from there to Teheran. And then when she talks
about the — the steep hills, that’s that journey there. And then from Teheran to
India.
Q: Okay. And how many years difference is there between you?
A: Fifteen.
Q: Fifteen. And your parents married where, in what — in what of these many
places?
A: Well, they — eventually, neither one of them was going back to communist
Poland, especially since one of the jobs that my father had, he was a second
lieutenant, an adjutant, and hi — one his jobs was to weed out communists from the
army, and he’s sent quite a few back. And his friends that ended up in England,
his soldier friends, his officer friends that did go back to Poland, disappeared. So
the — the thinking was, if — if you don’t go back to communist Poland — and of

course my mother and sister knew all about communism, and they weren’t going
back, so they — you know, they went to England, and so did my father, after he
fought in Italy, in Monte Cassino.
Q: He fought in Monte Cassino?
A: He did. And there was a — again a— a reli — a resettlement camp for soldiers in
Herford, and my sister and mother ended up in Coventry, and that’s not too far
away. And my mother decided to try to find some of the people she had met, and
he being one of them, and I ge — it was the soldiers’ daily newspaper, something
like that, she put an ad in there, and he answered it. And he — at that point he — he
was in the hospital because he had a accident, and she went to visit him, and the
rest is history, and here I am.
Q: And let us know his name again?
A: It’s Vavjinitz(ph), and Americans translate that to Lawrence, although I’m not
sure that’s correct.
Q: Okay, Vavjinitz(ph).
A: Vavjinitz(ph) Soletski(ph).
Q: Soletski(ph). And when you talked about him rooting out — looking for
communists in the military, that is trying to find them, does this mean the re-
formed military that was part of the Soviet [indecipherable]
