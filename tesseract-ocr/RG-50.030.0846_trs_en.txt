Interview with George Dynin °
October 21, 2015
Q: Tell me.
A: Because Yiddish — people that spoke Yiddish, they couldn’t survive. You don’t
know why. You see, peop — nobody will tell you this —
Q: Tell me.
A: — but I can tell you. The reason is that Yiddish left very heavy accent, and very
heavy kind of m-music type of thing, you know. And people that spoke Yiddish,
they can’t get rid of it. So, you know, as soon as they opened mouth, you know,
they — 1-1-in Polish, they knew that they are Jewish people, and it means that they
couldn’t — they couldn’t save themselves pretending to be Poles. So many
thousands of people died because they spoke Yiddish. It’s very unusual, but that’s is
true, I bi — nobody tell you because they say that it is offensive. It’s not offensive,
it’s just actually, this is how it is.
Q: Mm-hm. Did —
A: Yeah, go ahead.
Q: Does that mean that most people who spoke Yiddish didn’t speak Polish, or they
spoke it with an accent?
A: No, 90 percent, I would say, spoke Polish. Some, maybe in the small sh — s-s —
shtetls, you — like you know, the children, maybe they just spoke Yiddish only, but

Interview with George Dynin '
October 21, 2015
most people spoke both Polish and Yiddish. The ones that just spoke Yiddish, you
know.
Q: Yeah, yeah. So, were your parents more assimilated, in — in that they spoke
Polish and Russian, or —
A: Absolutely not.
Q: Okay.
A: They been — we [indecipherable]. It’s better — my father, he preferred to have a
kosher food.
Q: Okay.
A: But you know, from this you cannot — you change the type of food, and nobody
knows who you are, you know. But the language you cou — you couldn’t get rid of
it.
Q: No.
A: It’s just — it’s — yeah.
Q: It’s an accent, or it’s a —
A: It’s accent is kind of like a melody type of thing, Yiddish is. So that’s — many
people died because of this, but see, I am the first one that’s not afraid to tell about.
Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother —
A: Okay.
