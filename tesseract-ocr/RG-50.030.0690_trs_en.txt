SAMUEL MAREIN-EFRON
May 8, 2013
Question: This is a Rebecca Dillmeier interviewing Samuel Marein-Efron, on
May 8", 2013, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington, D.C. Can we begin by having you state your name, and spell your
name?
Answer: My name is Samuel Marein-Efron, spelled — hyphenated last name, and I
was born in Budapest, Hungary on May 5", 1933. And my parents’ names were
David and Dwojra, d-w-o-j-r-a, which is basically Polish for Deborah. My father
was born in a little town near Bialystok, called Krynki, k-r-y-n-k-i. And my
mother was actually born in Kiev, in the Ukraine. And in order to — to get back in —
into Poland after the we — welma — when the Russian revolution started, they had to
f — get her a false Polish birth certificate. And theoretically, on official papers, it
appears that she was born in Bialystok.
Q: Your parents moved to Budapest. When did they move to Budapest, and why?
What was the —
A: Well, it — it’s — it has the — it has a history. My father was doing quite well in
Poland, until Pilsudski came in. Then there was something which 1s referred to
historically as the Ugannah(ph). And basically what that was, it was a tax system
which taxed artisans and industrialists, and didn’t do very much for landowners, or
others. So my father was pressed financially, and he gave up — basically they sold

their factories in Poland, and the — they — my uncles remained, and they used to
rent space in — in other factories, but my father, at first, moved to Finland. And that
was a little bit too far from — from Poland. So he moved again to Zemun in — well,
today it is Serbia. And in Serbia he had a bad experience, he ran in with a cousin of
the king, who liked his business, so they gave him 72 hours to leave the country.
And he had a — a number of jobs, until finally he — he found a job with a very big
Hungarian complex called Csepel, that was run by a — a Jewish entrepreneur,
Manfred George — actually, George Manfred. Hungarians, they do it the other
way around. And he was head of — he first became the head of the factory that they
had in Slovakia, in Zylina, z-y-l-i-n-a. And first my mother wouldn’t — wouldn’t
think of — of living there, and nunb — it was the center of — basically, of Slovakian
nationalism. This man Klinker(ph) and — and Tiso(ph), this was their main — main
center of operations. And so my mother was very unhappy there, so she said — she s
— when she found out that she was pregnant, she decided that she — this was not the
place to deliver a child. So, we moved to the headquarters of the conglomerate,
which was Budapest.
Q: Could you say the name of the company again, and spell it?
A: It was called Csepel, c-s-e-p-e-l.
Q: And what — what did it do? What kind of company was it?

May 8, 2013
A: It was a huge complex, basically. It’s — it’s biggest income came from food,
from importing and export — basically exporting Hungarian agricultural products,
but he was also the main producer of aluminum in Hungary. He — they had a
generators sunk into the Danube. And not only did they produce aluminum, they —
they actually gave el-electricity to — to Budapest. And another thing which they
used to do were — was airplane parts. They used to manufacture airplane parts, and
they had a big, big textile complex on the island. It — Csepel is really the name of an
island in the Danube, but it was called Csepel, the complex itself. It’s — it — it
basically — he — he was pro — th-the owner was probably the second or third we-
wealthiest person in — in — in Hungary. And he — he — he was basically very, very
friendly with the government. In — and — any time they were short 10 — 10 or 15
million dollars, he would lend it to them, in lieu of taxes, so you know, the — the —
there was a very good relationship between him and the Hungarian government.
Q: And you were born in Budapest, after your parents had moved to Hungary?
A: I was born in Budapest, yes.
Q: When were you born?
A: May 5", 1933.
Q: 1933. Can you describe your early life; what it was like as an immigrant in
Hungary, or your parents’ lives as immigrants; school, religion?

May 8, 2013
A: Well, I— I—I was literally considered a Hungarian, even though by law, I wasn’t
one. In Hungary, to be Hungarian citizen, you had to have your father to be a
Hungarian citizen, which my father was not. He was a — a Polish citizenship. He —
he — he was born actually in the Russian part of Poland, but after Versailles, that
became again, it was recu — constituted as Poland, so he re — he became a Polish
citizen. But I — I was considered a Hungarian in school and elsewhere. My parents —
Hungarian is a very difficult language, and my mother spoke it passably, my father
very, very little, and my sister learned to speak Hungarian quite — quite well, I
mean. My sibling is seven and a half years older than I was, and she was actually
born in Bialystok, and she — she did learn Hungarian quite well, yes. But we were
both considered really Hungarians, even though nobody asked for our passports,
which was a1 -—a lucky thing.
Q: So at home did you speak, Russian, Polish, Yiddish?
A: Well, this 1 — this is very complicated, actually, th-the — the home language used
to be Russian. When I was born, I — I was not taught Russian. So basically, it
became a mix — mixture of German of Yiddish. My sister spoke — didn’t speak very
good Yiddish, she talked mostly German, because she went to German schools. My
father spoke Yiddish, my mother spoke very, very bad Yiddish. She spoke a very
complex mixture of Yiddish and German. It — it’s — it was a complicated affair. In

other words, no — no two people had a common language, you know, three people
had a common language.
Q: And you also — since you grew up in Budapest, you also spoke Hungarian?
A: I spoke — I spoke at first only Hungarian.
Q: Okay.
A: And then I — I learned German.
Q: Okay.
A: And I went for a while to a German school, and then I — somebody heard a — a
heart murmur in — in me, and so they put me to bed for six months. And after I — I
got out of bed, the German school wouldn’t have me there. So I had to go toa—a
Hungarian public school, which was perfectly adequate and nice.
Q: How old were you when this happened, when you got taken out of school for a
heart murmur? Do you remember’?
A: I was taken out of school at about age five.
Q: Okay.
A: Five, five and a half. And I was put back 1n school around age six. And we left
when I was age seven.
Q: Okay.
A: We — we — I have [indecipherable] my eighth birthday was in Mexico City.

Q: Oh. All right. We’ll get there.
A: Yeah.
Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the religious life of your family? Were they
very religious, not religious?
A: Well, my father and mother came from very, very religious families, especially
my father. My — my grandfather had been a melamed, a teacher. And he — he was
considered a rabbi. I’m not sure whether he had the smichas, whether he had the —
he could really be called a rabbi, but he was certainly — it — 1t seems, because I
never met him, that he was considered to be an extremely knowledgeable person,
and — and people used to come to him for advice. But my mother came from a reli —
religious family, but — an-and we were relatively religious. My mother kept a
kosher home to — to her dying day. And we — we used to go to holidays, to — to the
synagogue, and my father worked on Saturday, so that didn’t make him a very
religious person. And when he was traveling, he — he ate whatever he could get, not
— not basically very — he — he did not think of keeping dietary laws, and things like
that. I would say we were — we were traditional.
Q: Okay.
A: Not — not religious, but traditional.

Q: Okay. And your father traveled a lot for work. He — what — and he worked for an
[indecipherable] company. What, exactly, was his role in — do you know?
A: Well, hi-his main — first of all, he — he was a specialist in — in — in producing a
fabric which was made of [indecipherable] coat — coating fabric which — the word
that has come to — to us, is loden. And the reason it’s called loden is that the fa —
the main factory producing it, which was not from this complex, but from
somebody else, a man by name of Weingarten(ph), was in a section of Budapest
called Loden. So they used to say yes, we want the fabric from Loden, and the
name stuck. But he used to be a specialist, and one of the biggest problems that he
had was raw material. He had to find [indecipherable] and th-the — the — the two or
three plants where he was working consumed a huge amount of this, and specially
these are the years where armies in — in Europe had to be dressed, and this was the
basic coating material practically for everybody; for the German army, for the
Polish army, for the — you name it. Practically the whole western European armies
used to consume this heavy, loden fabric. But the problem was to find raw material,
which is why he ended up in the United States, as a matter of fact.
Q: Okay. We’ll get there, too.
A: Yeah.

May 8, 2013
Q: Before I want to — di— you were quite young when you left, but can you tell me
a little bit about what your life was like in Hungary? Do you remember when the
Jewish laws were passed in 1938, how that affected your family? Do you remember
those sorts of things?
A: Well, Pll — Ill tell you very truthfully, in Hungary there was so much latent
anti-Semitism that with laws and without laws, it — it — it didn’t change the situation
very much. I was a little bit surprised at the question that I was asked, because
curiously enough — and I spoke to my sister about this, it would seem that th-there
was less talk of Hitler in Hungary, as there was more talk of Mussolini. So, some
reason another, it was only in this corporate state was much more popular as a— as a
piece of conversation, than Hitler. And anti-Semitism was latent. In — in — in the
years before we left, where we didn’t know where the outcome was, there was, you
know, they were pe — recruiting Jewish young men, but some were sent to the army,
some were sent to work camps. The work camps turned out to be pretty much
extermination camps. I mean, they — they worked you to — to — to the bone, I think.
There was a—a movie called rou — Rosenschein(ph), or something like that, which
described one of these work camps in — in Hungary. But basically, no-nobody
heard anything. At least w-we — we weren’t aware of it. And going to a German
school, we were not very aware of it. I mean, we were aware of it in that for

example, the — the Nazi clubs in which the youth — youth clubs, wouldn’t have us.
And that — certainly my sister was absolutely livid, because you know, uniforms
and parties, and — and excursions, and whatever it is. But even the school, there was
no — no — no latent anti-Semitism. There were quite a few Jewish students in — in
the — in the German school.
Q: And when you went to a Hungarian school, was it any different, or —
A: No, no —
Q: The same?
A: — because we were all —
Q: Okay.
A: —I mean, since I — the — the language, my — should be saying my mother tongue
was Hungarian.
Q: Yeah.
A: I certainly was not — not looked upon very differently as any — as anywhere else.
Q: I feel like you kind of touched on this, but did your family live in a Jewish
neighborhood, interact mostly with Jewish people, or mixed Hungarian —
A: Well, basically, there was such a huge Jewish population in Budapest, that you
can hardly pinpoint a — a Jewish neighborhood. I mean —
Q: Okay.

May 8, 2013
A: — all — all neighborhoods had Jews. We were living basically, in the area which —
right — right on the Danube where — where actually, where the Swedish embassy
bought most of those buildings, later on, I mean, we — were not there anymore. But
that — that is where — where the Swedish embassy bought all those buildings. It was
right on the — on the shore of the Danube, right in front of Saint Margaret’s island,
Margitteet(ph). And it was really — it was a wealthy community, it was — you had
to have a certain — certain economic status to be able to live there.
Q: Okay.
A: And — but then there were Jewish synagogues, Jewish [indecipherable]. There
were — there — there wi — there was even a synagogue three or four blocks down, on
the street. But you couldn’t pinpoint it as really — as a Jewish section. There were a
lot of Jews in there, but not — not necessarily Jewish.
Q: Okay. So let’s move forward a little bit, and talk about your father’s travels, and
how it brought him to New York, and — and the dates when that happened.
A: Well, my father, around 19 — well, he — he — he had constantly — was constantly
on the move, trying to locate raw materials, he — he went to places, you know,
which we thought were absolutely the end of the world, like Greece or Turkey or
north Africa. But there were — there was considerable wool merch — wool — wool
products, used wool products there. He had the brother, for example that he set up

in business in Paris, collecting for him. But no ma — he had — they had a
relationship with the English company called John Crowther and Sons, in
Milnsbridge, which supplied a lot of raw material too, but th-they were always
starved for raw material. So my father decided that the only sizable place that he
could think of that would have raw material was the United States. And basically,
he also had there two brothers and a sister, which he hadn’t seen in some 30 years.
So he, you know, he figured all of these things together, my mother wouldn’t go,
because we had to go to school, and so forth, and so on. Those trips were long. And
he — he planned to be away for a long, long, long period of time, because he had to
set up this business. So he actually came to New York, and he — he set up a
business in Passaic, New Jersey, and he spent here well over six months, I think
about nine months, or something like that. And then he decided to go back to — to
Europe, and he got as far as Belgium, and took the train to — to Berlin, but he was
turned back, because the Germans had invaded Belgium. So, he basically got onto
the same boat that he took to New York, and came back to New York. He made a
second attempt to return to southern Europe, but he only got as far as France, and
he had to turn back. And then, of course, the United States was very, very — should
we Say, not receptive to — to — to refugees from an — anybody from Europe, as they
had this quota system, which I understand 90 percent of the quota were never filled.

But anyways, he — he applied to stay in the United States, and he was hoping to
bring us all there, at least to sit out the — the — the war, because he knew that if he
couldn’t get back two ways, I mean there was no reason for us to — to stay there. So
he applied here f— as a matter of fact, there’s a man by the name of Yrin, who does
genealogy in this country, y-r-i-n. And one day, from the blue, he contact me,
because this — a second name in my last name is Efron, and he was making a
history of the Efrons. And he asked me about it, and — and he seems to have found,
in the Springfield repository of the national archives, actually first papers from my
mother, myself and — and my sister. But first papers, we never got the visa.
Q: Right.
A: So the problem was that he was about to — to be deported. And somebody told
him that in Mexico, if he showed a certain amount of money, you could get an
investors visa. So, since he had a — he came with a considerable amount of money
to set up this business, there was no problem with that. He — he — he sira — he — he
presented his papers, he — he — he put in — he — he showed them the deposit in the
bank and so forth, and so on. And I understand there was a — a— a problem with —
with telegrams and God knows what, but basically he got the — the visa about two
days before he was going to be deported from the United States. So he traveled by
train to the border, to Laredo. And this was June.

A: For — 1940.
Q: 1940, okay.
A: And Laredo in June is the — I think hell 1s cooler than — than Laredo. It’s abou —
about 105 — 110 in the shade, and no shade. And this was before air conditioning.
The only relief was a movie theater, because the — they had these huge ice blocks,
which somebody was — they had ventilators blowing on them there; called ice
cooled, or whatever it was. So somebody told him that Mexico City was somewhat
more pleasant, 1t a — the weather was — was more pleasant. So he took the train to
Mexico City, he had a Mexican visa. So he took the train to Mexico City and — and
true in — the temperature was like — like the Balkans and — and th — in the middle of
summer, Mexico City runs around 22 to 26 degrees centigrade. Around 80, at — at
best. So he found very pleasant. And by — by accident, he met some people that he
knew from — from Europe. He was sitting in the park, and suddenly he saw people
that he remembered in Paris. You know, the — the — you had to — you had to know
somebody to get money out of Europe at that time. Everybody had a — a currency
control system. So he had — he knew these two people, one from Geneva, one from
Paris, who had been doing this for Jews, all over central Europe. They were
moving money in and out of central Europe, and moving it to the United States, to

the Chase Manhattan bank, through Chase Manhattan in — in Paris. So he saw
these two people in the park, and says, what are you doing here? They says, the
same thing that you are. We are waiting for an American immigration visa. So my
father said, you know what, we don’t know how long we’re going to have to wait,
whether it’s a week, a month, or — or — or years. And we’re eating up our capital,
you know, maybe we should start doing something. So they — they got together, and
they started a business, which lasted 50 — 54 years, 55 years, and by the time when
my father got his American immigration visa, he wasn’t interested. He had already
made a — quite a commitment to — to Mexico. So we — we — we remained in
Mexico.
Q: While your father was in — well, when your father left, what was your family in
Hungary doing? I assume — did he leave — do you know if he left for New York
before or after Germany invaded Poland, in 1939?
A: He left — he — he must have left before the invasion of Poland.
Q: Okay.
A: He — he must have left around probably June —
Q: Okay, so just before.

A: Well, my father, since he was still working through the company, we — we were
drawing his salary, and my father was probably drawing one of his biggest salaries
in Hungary, if not the biggest salary. So we were living quite — quite — quite
comfortably, we — we had our apartment on Santish(ph) Venut(ph), which is a po —
a —a very — was a very stylish, very, very well-to-do neighborhood, and we kept
living normally, the way we had tha — lived before.
Q: Where — do you know if your parents started to become concerned when
Germany invaded Poland? Were there ideas on getting out then, or —
A: Well, w-we were concerned, we were very concerned, because two things
happened. The first thing was I had a cousin who was the daughter of my aunt in
Poland. And she had — sh-she had not been able to get into an — a Polish university,
because of the numerous clauses, because of the Jewish exclusion rule. So she had
taken on — she had gone to the Charles University in Prague, and she was studying
medicine there, and we kept very close contact with her. She — she used to come
several times a month to Budapest to see m — to see — see our family. And
basically, my father was supporting her. And she basically told us that, you know,
they — she had been able to speak to her parents up to probably November of — of
1939. And the way she mi — she was able to speak to them is that basically she
found a — a farmer — they found a farmer whose telephone was still working for

long distance calls. And every weekend they used to be in touch with her. And then
suddenly, at the end of November, they — no more was heard from them. She tried —
my cousin tried to go back into Poland, she was sent back from the border, she was
not allowed in. And so, you know, we — we were extremely worried, because we —
we heard nothing. That was the last thing we ever heard of my aunt and uncle. But
my — my cousin was in constant touch with us. And as a matter of fact, even
through the war, she was in touch with us. She — she was — again, she was being
financed both economically, and false papers, by the management of the company
with — which my father had a partnership in Zylina. So she basically — I— I don’t
know how this man did it, but he — he — through the red cro — we were getting Red
Cross letters almost every two or — two or three months. Heavily censored, but at
least we got news, and said that, you know, she was all right, and this and that, and
the other thing, but w-we kept pretty — pretty — pretty much in touch with her til — til
early 1944.
Q: Okay. And I definitely want to hear more about your father’s involvement in
finan — in, I guess supplying false papers to people in places. Is that —
A: Well, it — it is — the — the company, which was — my father originally got into the
company by managing the — the — this huge plant that they had Zylina, in Slovakia.
And the plant was managed by man called Mousekopf(ph). This man Mousekopf

was Jewish, and he — he managed to — to — since he — it was important for the
German war effort — I mean, he was producing coating and fabrics for — for the
German army. He was what they call a protected Jew. So basically he — he was able
to move around and — and he was able to — to employ a lo — there was a very big ge
— pop — Jewish population in Zylina. Zylina is very close to the Polish border, it’s a
Polish German border. So, he was able to — to — to supply jobs to a lot of the Jews in
the — in the city, and many of these people were not supposed to be there. In other
words, they — they had been refugees from Poland. So they — Mr. Mousekopf(ph)
managed to get residence papers for them. And they didn’t get residence papers, he
did exactly what he did for my cousin, which 1s picked up papers of people that had
died, or something like that. Which was very dangerous and not — not — it — it — you
know, it’s something that may have worked for a month or two, and then they had
to fire them, a-and give them a new set of papers, and rehire them, because the
Germans — not the Germans, but the — the USB, the Slovakian secret service
suddenly got the list of people which had died, and this man — these peop — 1-1t was
a—a very complicated undertaking, but he — he managed to — to save, I would say
several hundred, if not — not — not a thousand, or more people in the Zylina area for
— from the Germans, until 1944, when the Germans came in, got rid of the

Slovakian puppet government, and that was the — then there they took Jews, no
matter whether protected or unprotected, or whatever they were.
Q: And is that the last you heard from your cousin?
A: And the —
Q: The last you heard from your cousin in — at that time?
A: Well, my cousin — my cousin is a— was a strange person. She was a strange
person to the day that she died. She was a rebel, of the worst sort. I mean, as a child
she had joined Hashomer Hatzair in Bialystok, which was not considered very —
very Jewish, among the better — better members of the community, because they
were the poorest of the poor, and the — the — they were definitely communistic. So,
she had joined the Hashomer Hatzair, and of course, she in see — she was the only
one that was living in the — 1-in a decent housing area, all the meetings were held in
her apartment, and my uncle used to absolutely blow his top. But it passed. And she
was like that, too. She went to — to Czechoslovakia, and when the Germans
invaded, she — she — she was part of the Czech underground. She basically spoke
very good German, and she looked German. She — she was blonde, blue eyed. Blue
eyed to the point of gray eye. So she made friends in the German occupation forces,
and she got herself a job as the doctor. She — she was still a medical student, but she
was in her process of getting her internship, whatever it is. So she was able to get

herself a job at the Gestapo jail in — in — in — in Prague, and she became the conduit
between the people which were being held at the jail, and the underground and their
families. And she did this til 1941, the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938.
The university was closed, I think in November of 1938, because of strikes, student
strikes. But she — she remained there, and she became an important cog 1n the
communications system of the underground, with these people, until — until the end
of 1941, when she suspected that she was compromised. In fact, we’ve gone to the
Holocaust Museum facilities, German files, and it’s a fact. I mean, the Germans had
her take — they had picked her up several times and let her go. But there was a—a
record that she had been caught at — as a Jewess not wearing a Jewish yellow Star of
David. There were several reasons that she had been picked up, because she had
managed to — she — she was extremely adroit at getting herself out of trouble. As a
matter of fact, she got, at one point, papers, which Mr. Mousekopf(ph) didn’t know
it, but they were of a communist girl. And guess what? The Germans had her on the
list of — of people that they — they had to — so she came — she was taken to Gestapo
headquarters, she was taken to the Gestapo head. And she walks into her office —
into his office, and she sees a picture behind his desk of Bialystok. So he — she
didn’t let him say hello, it’s just — she says, you know, ho-how did you ever have
this picture of Bialystok? So he says, well, you know, I was stationed there, I was

the head of the Gestapo in Bialystok. So how — how were you related to Bialystok?
She says, well, I— I belong to the German population of Bialystok, which — which
were factory owners, and my father was a factory owner. And this is how I know
Bialystok very well. My — my — my parents were still there for a while, I don’t
know where they are now, because the general — Generalgouvernement is not very
informative as to where people are. So, you know, he made — she made a friendship,
and when she walked in, she was about to be sent to wherever — God knows
[indecipherable] was sent. She managed to walk out four hours later. And she
managed also to — this false paper that she had, she managed to give it a certain aura
of credibility. In other words, you know, he asked her, well, how come you are a
communist? She says, you know, these were things of when you are a young ma —
person, you — you think of other people, and this and that, and not of yourself. But
this is something which is — which is gone past. So she managed to — to survive this
way, on this set of papers, for close to three — three — well, more than that, she — she
— she crossed the — the — she’s crossed into Slovakia from — from the Czech
Republic, from the other half, the night of Christmas of 1942. They figured that,
and figured correctly that the German guards would be all drunk, having a
Christmas party, and there was a huge snowstorm that night, but they managed to
cross into Slovakia. Into Slovakia, they already had Mr. Mousekopf(ph) to help

her, and she lived in Nitra from late 1941 to early 1944, til practically August,
September of 1944. She — she had joined also, the Slovakian underground. There
was a Slovakian uprising, I think in August — July or August of 1944, which was the
reason that the Germans came in. They felt that the Slovakians couldn’t handle this,
so they came in, and they cleaned out the place, to their liking. My cousin, curiously
enough, could have survived, but again, she — principle was — used to get her, and
this time it got her, too. Was basically she — she — she tells that she was picked up
by the Germans, taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and sat down with a group of
Jews. And this man that she knew in the Gestapo walked in, and says, what are you
doing sitting there? You’re not Jewish. Go home. So she got up and went home, and
she describes it as having had a terrible night. I mean, considering that the rest of
the Jewish population was being done to something, and deported, or whatever it is.
So she basically walked in the next morning, into Gestapo headquarters and said,
you know, you’re looking for Jews, I’m Jewish. The man was floored. He never in
his wildest dream imagined her to be Jewish. She was about as far physically from
being a Jew as — as — as you can imagine. Of course, didn’t — this didn’t help her.
But she helped other people. She took Mr. Mousekopf’s(ph) wife and daughter.
She — she — she was able to — she went to Birkenau, and in the same transport, Mr.
Mousekopf’s(ph) wife and daughter were — were in that same transport. Mr.

Mousekopf(ph) had been actually — was able to hide with some — some Catholic
priest. And she — she told the people at Birkenau that she was a surgeon, she was a
—a doctor. So there was a shortage of doctors, not only for — for the inmates, but for
actually the general population outside of the camps. So she was transported to
Gross-Rosen, which was a satellite camp. And she said that she needed assistants.
She was put in charge of a group of 200 agriculture workers, that were working in
the fields around Gross-Rosen. So she said that, you know, she needed assistants.
So she got the wife and daughter of — of this man Mousekopf(ph) to be her
assistants, and all — all three survived the war. And she — she not only — she was
actually taken by the camp commandant to his town in northern Germany, to see
his mother, who was sick. And she says she could have stayed there. I mean, they
liked her, they — they fed her, they — they clothed her, they — and — and they were
very interested for her to stay around, because the mother seemed to be better with
her being around. But she felt a responsibility, curiously enough, for those 200
people in Gross-Rosen, so she went back to the camps, and she stayed there til
liberation, til — til May — May of 1945. Of course, we — we — we found out about her
almost immediately. As liberation occurred, she was able to communicate with us,
and we asked what happened to Mother and Father, and she says, we don’t know. I
lost total communications with her. I spoke to Vera(ph) the last time, which was

end of 19 — 1939, early 1940. And she — you know, she told us the whole story, but
we were — and my father actually came back, and believe it or not, paid — returned
the money to the company that had been given out for my cousin, not for the other —
well, the others worked at the company. But he felt that, you know, property pro —
propriety was important.
Q: Well, what was your cousin’s name?
A: How?
Q: Your cousin’s name?
A: Her name is Shula(ph) Lozowska. Her married name was Graf(ph).
Q: Okay.
A: As — as a matter of fact, it’s very funny, but we were in Prague about two years
ago, and one of the synagogues has all 50,000 deportees name on it. So my wife
says, you know, do we know anybody here? So curiously enough, you know,
50,000 names, coincidence is un — unbelievable. Right in front of my face was
Shula(ph) Lozowska.
Q: Wow, my gosh.
A: 1913, it didn’t have a second date for her, because they knew that she was
deported to Birkenau. Very, very few people came back from the — Birkenau.
Q: Wow. How do you spell her name?

happy here. Budapest is a nice, clean city, with no problems of any — any sort. So,
basically, I actually think that somebody — a — a general, or maybe even a field

marshal — I mean, the German army, who was the buyer for the cloth for the
German army, came to talk to my mother, and he told her, look, this is no — no time
for a Jew to be in — in — in Europe, and you know the — this will take a year, two
years, and everything will be settled again, everything will come into its normal
course, and you’ll come back. But at this point, this is no point — no time to — for a
Jew to be in — in — 1n Europe. Convinced her. The next problem was how to — how
to travel. My father had arranged for her to — to take Verlichs(ph) out of Trieste —
th-the ship out of Trieste to New York, there were two problems. First of all, she c-
couldn’t — she — she — it was very difficult to get a transit visa to the United States,
which I think she finally got. But before she could leave, Mussolini got into the
war, so that cut it off. Next thing is how to go when there — there were a lot of
Jewish refugees who went to Russia. In other words, they — they took the Trans-
Siberian to Vladivostok, from Vladivostok to — to San Francisco, or if not, from
Vladivostok to Osaka, or Shanghai, and from there to — to San Francisco. So she
figured that that made sense. I mean, Hungary has a border with — with Russia, and
she hadn’t seen her mother for, I don’t know, 30 years, or 25 years, 30 years, so she
would do both things. So she started to get a— a — a Russian visa. She actually went
to the Russian consul, and she applied, and she left, and — and obviously the consul
was Jewish. And he came running after her, and he told her, look, I can give you a

visa, I can guarantee that you can get into the country. I cannot guarantee that you
will be allowed to leave. So my mother, you know, advice to the wise — wise, you
only give once. So she tried then, going out through — through Spain, through —
well, there were several problems in there. First of all, the Mexicans did not wish to
give her the visa on anything but the Polish passport. And the Cubans wouldn’t give
her a transit visa either on — except on the Polish passport. She still had the valid
Polish passport. I mean, Poland didn’t exist, but she still had a valish por — Polish
pa — of course, here the problem came to the rest of Europe. I mean, place like
Switzerland, a place like Austria, a place like unoccupied France. To them
Poland doesn’t — did not exist anymore.
Q: Right.
A: So, you couldn’t — you know, you can’t travel through us with that Polish
passport. So my father’s company, since they had such good relationship with the —
with the Hungarian government, managed to get, for my mother, a
[indecipherable] passport, a League of Nations passport. So, well she — she got
herself into, you know, this is a complication. First you couldn’t — at that time you
couldn’t travel with two passports. So one had to be very well hidden. So basically,
she was — 1-1t took her a good six months, or seven months, to get all the transit
visas there. The German transit visa through all — through then Germany, German

Austria, and you had to go through southern Germany, through Miinsing to
Munich, to the Swiss border. And then you went across Switzerland to Geneva,
and then you took a — a train across Vichy, France to [indecipherable] in Spain.
The — the most difficult visa of them all was the — was the French, the
[indecipherable] government visa. She managed to — to get it. She — she was a very
strong woman, and she wouldn’t take no for an answer, so she managed to get
everything together by about February of 1941. And we left for — for Spain, and
traveled through Germany. We managed to — to be in men — min — Miinsing, in
Munich the night of the — of the speech of Hitler in the — in the beer — beer
stuben(ph), in the beer — beer hall. And the British were bombing, and you know,
being in the railroad station during a bombing 1s the wrong place to be. Anyways,
noth — they did not bomb there. They were trying to get Hitler, so they bombed all
of Munich, except for the railroad station. We got out of there, we got into
Switzerland, we had to stay in Switzerland almost two weeks, I think. And then
we went to Spain, and Spain was another problem, because Spain — this was the
end of the civil war, and th-there was no food in Spain. So we were given the
privilege to live in — in the hotel, which the Spanish government had for foreign
dignitaries, which was not far from the Prado. So we stayed there til — til the boat
that we were supposed to take, arrived in Vigo. We went to Vigo, we had a — a bad

experience there, too. My mother was a type which when she traveled, took
everything with her. And imagine traveling to war torn Europe with 22 pieces of
luggage, including two steamer trunks. She managed it. I mean no ha — anyways, in
Spain, she made a — a terrible mistake. She met a Hungarian, and she said, you
know, I worry about this and that and the other thing, because I took everything. I
took my silver, I took my jewels, I took this, I took that, and everything is packed
away in these 22 bags. So sure enough, it was a terrible mistake, because the guy
went and spoke to the — to the Spanish customs. And we were already on the boat,
and suddenly Spanish customs come up on the boat, and hold the boat, and they
want to see my mother’s bags. So they started opening bags, and my sister, in all
innocence, she had a bar of chocolate, that we brought from Switzerland, and she
offered it to the — to the inspector, to the Spanish customs inspector, you know, as a
courtesy. Here, would you like to have this? Obviously the man hadn’t seen a bar of
chocolate in God knows when. He said, close up everything, we have nothing to do,
we’re just holding up the boat. Get out. So, you see, we were — we were saved by a
bar of chocolate. But my mother was, in that sense, you know, very strange. She —
she used to — people used to tell her, don’t do this. She said, Pll do it, and PI- Vl
carry it through, and she — she was able to carry through almost anything that she
undertook. She — very — very strong personality.

Q: Do you know what kind of visas your family traveled on to Mexico? Were you
also on investor visas, or —
A: No, we had — we had an immigration visa.
Q: An immigration visa?
A: Yes. A-Actually, that was very lucky, because the Mexican insis — wanted to
have a Polish passport, but they didn’t trust passports in general. So basically, what
they used to do 1s, an — and I'll try to get you a copy of that, too, they used to give
you a—a—a-—apiece of cardboard, with your picture on it, with a authorization to
enter Mexico. So basically, you didn’t have to have a passport. I-It — it was just
shown that the — at the consulate, or whatever it is, and the consulate, put all the
details of the passport in this piece of paper, and Mexican immigration didn’t — the
— the problem was, I understand, was Portugal, because in Portugal they wouldn’t
give her a transit visa, unless she had — showed a — a Polish passport, and she didn’t
want to show it. So, finally, after a long argument, saying look, Poland doesn’t
exist. Poland is now Germany.
Q: Right.
A: And we have no way of getting a— a German passport. So with that, and a little
consideration, I think helped — helped us get a transit visa to — to Portugal. So what
we did is we took the boat from Vigo, and the boat made a two day stop in Lisbon.

And in those two days that we stopped in Lisbon, my mother was able to pick up
the Mexican visa, and she — we’re also able to pick up matzos, because this was —
this was Passover time. My mother had gotten from the Jewish community there,
kosher [indecipherable] of food. I have no idea how she carried it though all of
Europe, especially through Switzerland, because Switzerland forbade you — one
of their — the only th-thing which was forbidden was to take food out of
Switzerland. There was plenty of food in Switzerland, but you couldn’t — you
couldn’t export any of it. My mother was able to pull that through, and quite a few
chocolate bars, which were our salvation, sooner or later.
Q: Do you know if you went to Mexico — if the Mexican government knew that you
were Jewish when you were getting your visas, or if you were just traveling at —
A: The Mexican — the Mexican government at the time was fairly liberal, and it was
fairly liberal — this was the time of Lazaro Cardenas. Lazaro Cardenas was
probably the only world leader which was supporting the republic in Spain. And he
had given instructions to all of his consulates, to give a-anybody that walked in, you
give him a visa. So, first of all, my father had the la — legal base to request a visa,
but otherwise, you would have gotten a visa as well. They — they were extraordinary
liberal. Unfortunately, very few people knew about this, so very few people availed
themself of this situation.

from [indecipherable] through all of Europe. And there were sort of hair-raising

Germans, and Germans were anti-Semites to start with, and here you have a very
religious Jew. Luckily there, I — I saved them, because the German officers were
occupied with me, because basically, I spoke very good German, and — and they
were fascinated with me. My sister helped me along, but basically it was I who —
who they were talking to. A-Again, you know, the — an unusual situation wa — since
the — since there — there was five of us, three a — three in our family, and this man
from [indecipherable] had somebody else with him. Not a wife, but somebody —
and not even a woman, but another man with him, which wasn’t as religious as he
was. But we were five in — in — 1n that compartment, so basically the compartment
was for six, but we managed to keep the compartment for us five. So, basically,
curiously enough, also the — the transit visa for Germany was given to us the same
day. The transit visa from Switzerland wasn’t. The transit visa from southern
Spain wasn’t. The transit visa to Spain took some time to — no-no-not as much as
the French one, but it took — and of course, you know, there were things which I
noticed. For example, when we were traveling to southern Spain — southern
France, they came — people came with paint in Geneva, and they painted over the
windows, which we are not supposed to look outside the — the — the windows. We —
we — we — it — it was a long trip. Today — today it’s also an overnight trip. We — we

made it, I think, in a day and a night, or something like that. We got to Portbou —
Portbou, there was no — no con — there was no railroad connection in Portbou.
Q: Where is that?
A: That’s the Spanish — Spanish border.
Q: Okay.
A: Yeah. Catalonia, and — and so we took a bus ride to, I think Girona, and that
was a — believe me, Mexico has nothing to offer like that. It was a one — one — one
lane road, an-and every time you met a truck — it was night — every time they met a
truck, you know, it was a —a battle of words to see who would go back to a place
where — where they could both pass. And this is not a very long trip, but it took
about eight hours to — to get to Girona. Girona there was a train already to — to
Barcelona.
Q: Okay.
A: We stayed in Barcelona, but in Barcelona we didn’t — you could find two things
to eat. One was bananas, and the other one was hazelnuts. So that was our — our —
our diet was hazelnuts and bananas.

A: I really don’t know, I — I tell you very truthfully, I — I guess there must have
been people to help you with bags, or something like that, because at that time,
every time you got to a border, you know, the inspection wasn’t on the train. You
had to get off the train, take off your bags, take — take it to the customs house, get
your document stamped at the customs house, have your baggage inspected, and get
onto the train again. I don’t know how she managed, but she did manage. I — I do
remember some passengers being very unhappy of the train being held up because
of my mother, but somehow she managed to do it, she — she — she — she got us
through all of these country — all of these borders, into Spain. And she had a lot of
valuables, because one of the things that we were not allowed to — to take out of
Hungary was money. So we got valuables, so my mother had gold this, and gold
that. My sister had gold. And my mother made a mistake, she — she put the gold
watch on me. And the Germans looked at my mother, and let her pass. Looked at
my sister, 14 year old with gold necklace, and some gold armbands, and God
knows, and they had a few thoughts about that one. But when they saw a gold watch
on me, then when they decided that they weren’t going through, and a lot of this
was confiscated at the German border. Not confiscated, because Germans are —
were [indecipherable] very honest, so they — we gave them an address in Budapest

Q: Okay. Okay. Okay. So, can you tell me a little bit about the boat ride? How long
did it take to get to Mexico?
A: Well, we left Vigo, between a two day stop in Vigo, it too-took the better part of
three weeks. It took 17 days, I think to — to get to Havana. In Havana we — in
Havana we — we were taken off the boat and — and also there was all kinds of
papers, and this and that and the other. And they sent you to an island in the Bay of
Havana, called Trisko(ph) Onus(ph). It took me a year — several years, 20, to find
out that the place was called Trisko(ph) Onus(ph). My mother kept refori —
referring to it as Triskonia(ph). We — we spent, I think two nights on — on this
island, til they processed our papers. And then we were sent to Havana, where we
stayed for about probably 10 days, because you know, th-the — the boats were not
all at the same time, so you had to wait for the arrival of the boat. And this was a lib

— and the — and the boat which we had come to Havana with [indecipherable] is
the Comillas, The Compania Transatlantica Espanola. It’s a boat which survived
the war, and was still in service after the war, and the trip from — from Havana to
Vera Cruz was on a boat — boat called the Monterey(ph), which was quite
luxurious. Even I could tell that 1t was not — not th — the regular — regular boat, there
were — there — we had the very — very ample cabin, very nicely furnished one.
Everything was screwed down, but very nice cabin. And when we got to Mexico,
there was again the problem of processing all of this, and — and processing the
furniture, pro-processing the 22 bags, and the papers, and Mexican customs were
not exactly the fastest in the world. So, actually, we arrived on the 21% of April, and
I think by the fifth of May, we were still in — in Vera Cruz. And I wasn’t very sure
about Mexico. But then, the fifth of ma — May was my birthday, so I suddenly see
fireworks, and parties, and whatever it is, so you know, I figured it wasn’t such a
bad country, if they celebrated my birthday. It was very kind of them to do so. But
no, we were — in — in Mexico we were definitely known as Jews, we were — in — as
a matter of fact, one of the problems was that the Mexican immigration square, that
piece of paper with a picture, said very clearly that we were Jewish. It had a
religion. Except, you know, we got it in — in Lisbon, so there was no — I re — I really

wanted the job, so he — he — he got himself into trouble with the communist
authorities. My cousin as — as rebel as she has been always, she went to get her

secret service was — was being — looking for them, so they — they left with a small
bag in the middle of the night. But again, the people where they were living kept
everything, including the furniture. And — and you know, when these people in the

even though they — the government itself was very friendly, and didn’t care whether
you were Jewish, or not Jewish, or whatever you were. The question is, were you a
refugee, or weren’t you a refugee? And even though we had come in not as a
refugee, the Mexican government was, very, very friendly, and very open. There
was a movement in Mexico at that time called the — the Mexican traditionalist
movement. And this was heavily anti-Semitic. Basically their — the people who had
been there earlier, had — had an awful lot of trouble, because Jews began
monopolizing some of the downtown markets in Mexico City, and the Mexican —
th-the people who had been in these stores, in — before, even though they sold out,
they — it’s not that they were pushed out, they were sold out, they — they started
bearing a resentment, and this traditionalist movement was very unpleasant. In other
words, they — they used to come to the boats, and used to have placards, and Jews
go home, and don’t — we don’t need you, and this and that and the other thing. Not
only Jews, but the refugiados, which mean refugees in generals, and this was
Spaniards, and — basically Spaniards. But Jews were also included in the — there —
there — there — there are some books about it. There’s actually a very interesting
book written by a friend of ours. I can — I can let you have that too, eventually. It —
it was called “Momiento Traditionaliste Mexicano,” and it had two generals as

head of it. And they were very, very, very unpleasant. Instead of Brownshirts, they
had Camisas Parvilas(ph), which is sort of a gray, like a mousy gray, but you
know, it wa — they were inspired on the — on the Brownshirts. But th-there was
always, you know, in — in — in [indecipherable] Catholic countries, Mexico was —
it was always a lay — latent anti-Semitism. But for all its latency, never — never —
never got over the age of the [indecipherable] it stayed relatively in its place. And
it — it — you know, my father start in a place called Pueblo, which was basically an
extraordinarily Catholic city. Su-Super Catholic city. The reason for it, of course, 1s
that there was not — there were a lot of old Spanish residents there. Not — the new
Spanish were communists and Socialists, and whatever it is. But the old Spanish
residents were — were very traditional. As a matter of fact, the Spanish club in
Mexico had — that time had a throne waiting for the king and queen to come, when
there was no queen and queen — king and queen any more. And, strangely enough,
they did get to use it when this man became — when Franco made this man king of
— but curiously enough, the — the — there was — we — we — we never met up with too
much anti-Semitism.
Q: Okay. From Vera Cruz, did you go to Pueblo, where your father was living?
A: No, from Vera Cruz we actually went to Mexico City.

A: My — my f — my father — my mother especially, didn’t think very much of
Pueblo. We — we — we lived in Pueblo for a while, because my father, you know,
felt that somebody should be there. But they finally dis — th-there were several
partners, there were three po — three or four partners. So, what happened is that each
partner used to spend a week there. So basically they had one week in — in the
month to spend there. Ma — my mother tried at first, but Pueblo was a miserable
town, it wa — it — it was very close. It was — you know, it was still old Mexico, it
was the — the place where — where women knew two — two — two roads in the city,
one from — from their house to their mother-in-law’s, and from their mother-in-
law’s to — to the market. That was — that was the extent of their — their travels. It
was very traditionalist place. But th — th — you know, it was basically like Hungary.
There was — there was — you could sense in the air, the anti-Semitism. But you —
real — really, expression of it by violence, you didn’t — you didn’t see. Well, except
for — for these Camisas Parvilas(ph). But these were also — they were not — they
were not constant, they were intermittent. There was a man who was called the
Mexican Hitler, Abascal — actually he’s — he’s — one of his sons became labor
minister in the Fox administration.

in-law. His brother-in-law used to run a — a textile complex, like we — we used to
do. But the brother-in-law was not that unpleasant. I-It — it — what — I'll tell you, the
only violence that I had was, I was playing in the park in Budapest. By chance, you
know, in Budapest you left your child, and you told him not to — not to go too far,
and just left him. So I was playing around, and two — two obviously hoodlums, or
whatever it is, caught me and I don’t know why, you know, they did say you Jew,
you’re a Jew, this zsid6, whatever it is. And one pushed me, and he managed to — I
managed to hit a stone — stone — I don’t know what it was, it may have been some
sort of a sit — place to sit on, or — and I had to get four stitches.

again — again, a strange place. If you went to the real high, conservative, old
Mexicans, they — they fell in love with Adolf Hitler. They — in fact, they used to
have oil paintings, and — of Adolf Hitler in their homes, and oil paintings, which

once in a while show up in antique shows — shops today in Mexico. And it was
strange, because you know, at — it — Hitler used to occupy the place of the Virgin of
Guadalupe in the home. In other words, the — his place was above the mantle, and
whatever it is. Fortunately, Germans were not — you know, didn’t think very much
about Mexicans, you know, they were just one chain below — below whatever they
— they liked. So, I happen to know a lot of people, and especially in the German
school system, at th-that time, before they closed it down. The man who had
actually run the German school in Budapest was running the German school in — in
Mexico, and — and he had been very friendly. As a matter of fact, there was another
couple of Jewish boys which had been in Budapest as well, which lived in Mexico,
and this man wanted us to go — go — all go into the German school, because he
needed the native German speakers, and couldn’t find them in Mexico. So, my
mother didn’t want to, and the Mexican government was helpful enough in closing
down the — the German school, because the embassy was — was playing games. But
it was amazing to me, because th-the Mexican kids were handled very badly by the
Germans, you know, with — no matter what their social condition was, they were
really treated like second class citizens. Curiously, we were not. I mean, we were
there maybe for a week, or two weeks, or whatever it 1s, but we were not — not
treated like — like second class citizens at all.

Q: Is this in Mexico City?
A: This is in Mexico City, which —
Q: Okay, uh-huh.
A: — which, you know, if you look at it in the — in — in the distance, it was strange,
because the — the man in Mexico City, the ambassador, was a out and out Nazi.
And th-the person in charge of the embassy, who had been somebody living in
Mexico was an out and out Nazi. And he didn’t seem to bother us, but he — he
bothered the Mexicans, and the mother — the mothers used to come crying to the —
to the director, saying why do you treat my child like that? And they kept sending
the children back, instead of taking them out, until the government finally closed
down the school, and there was no — but it was, you know, like the American school

Octavio Paz, the — the Mexican diplomat and author went to a ger — to the German
school, to the Alexander von Humboldt school, and so did a lot of intellectuals,

she was getting me just — lice on me. That, you know, I shouldn’t do this, and I was
taken out, and I was put into a— a—a military school, Mexican Spanish, ru-run by a
former Jesuit. And I stayed there til about the sixth grade, seventh grade, and then
my sister convinced my mother that I — I should be educated in the United States,
so I, in junior — in junior high school I started going to — to the American school
myself.
Q: Okay. Were you or — did your family learn Spanish while you were — when you
were in school? Did you learn Spanish? I guess you had to?
A: Well, I'll tell you very truthfully, I — I-—I didn’t speak for about three or four
months, and then suddenly I broke out spe-speaking Spanish; my sister likewise.
My mother, she didn’t speak good Spanish, but she managed. My father was not a
linguist. He never quite spoke Spanish, but I was always surprised that the workers
knew exactly what he wanted. And you know, this was mechanics, too, I mean, he
explained to them, you know, a complex piece of equipment, that — what he wanted
to do with it. I didn’t understand a word of what he said, but the mechanic knew
exactly what he — in other words, everybody seemed to meet halfway. In other
words, my father’s Spanish was understood by the — the Mexicans he was dealing
with, but it was — he — he managed quite well, actually. He traveled all over the

country, and you had to — you know, you had to buy again, raw material. Wool was
difficult to get from Australia, you could get it, but it was the — difficult those war
years.
Q: Yeah.
A: So he — he used to travel all over Mexico, buying up wool locally, which was
also in competition with various existing — existing companies. It’s — actually, that
was the only — the only anti-Semitic problem that they had. They had — there was an
— an established Spanish company called Espana Industrial. And they were
making money head over foot, and I mean, they were sending, for about nine
dollars, something which cost them a dollar to make, or a dollar-fifty to make. And
my father, since he knew the trick of using waste, was undercutting them,
underselling them, so one day he was called into this Spanish company’s whatever
— offices, and was told that either he sold at their same price, or they will put him
out of business. So my father said, you know what, I’ve — I’ve just escaped from —
from worse than that, and you know, try, and see who — who — who is out of
business first. They were out of business before we were. I-It’s — th-th-there was
latent anti-Semitism in Latin America. In — in — in Argentina, it’s bad. In Mexico
it was latent. There — there were some fantastic stories. For example, in Pueblo,
there were a lot of Germans. And there was a hotel of all things, called the Ritz, in

downtown Pueblo. And on Friday nights, the German colony used to close down
the — the hotel’s dining halls, lock the doors. They used to dress themselves up in —
in Nazi uniforms, and used to sing the Horst Wessel song, and things like that. Real
— real Nazi. There was never in — in Mexico, despite some people who were try to
make — make it up, there was never a — a real Nazi movement in Mexico, look like
— like Argentina, Bolivia, and other places. Th-There — there was a lot of Nazi
sympathy, but very, very, very little — curiously, the Japanese were more active in —
in — in—1n Mexico. They — they destroyed several bridges on the western part of
Mexico. They — our competitor, one of the reasons we were able also to slow him
down a little bit is that he had no compunctions of selling to the Japanese, and there
were several Japanese submarines that — that came out to — to buy his merchandise.
He had na — Americans wouldn’t let him into the United States after the war. And
basically, where you used to get machinery, and raw material was the United
States, so — so he had a very serious problem. That helps him — put him 1— put him
out of business. Overt anti-Semitism, you know, actual violence, no.
Q: So would you say that your immigrant experience in Mexico was defined more
by being a European, or more by being Jewish? Were you able to find a Jewish
community, a European community, or —

A: Well, I— I1— we were a little bit lost in the Jewish community, too, because there
was a very big German community, it was called Evuno(ph). And there were a lot
of people who — who had had troubles with Nazis, especially socialists. The — the
former head of the socialist party in Germany was — was in Mexico, he — he
became a photographer, and that’s what he made a living on. But for a while, he
was working with the Mexican government, especially with the socialists in
Mexico. But there were a lot of Germans. There was Frank, and the — Dr. Frank,
there was his — his grandson became health minister in Mexico, and there — there —
there were a lot of — there — there were a lot of German Jews there. One of the — the
grandsons of one or — other one, became the — the environmental minister of
Mexico. And 1-in — je — we — we — we were — we were more at ease with the
Germans than we were with the Poles.
Q: Okay.
A: My father had learned Polish late — late in life, and so had my mother. And the
few Jews who — all the — the Jews that came from Poland were very Poland
oriented, which my father and mother — they used to go because, you know, it was
one way of socializing. And the Poles had an own — their own club, and they used
to get together once a week just to speak Polish. So my mother used to go, my
father used to go. But they were uncomfortable there too, because they — they were

not Poles, they were — they — they — their allegiance was closer to Russian Jewry
than they were to Polish Jewry. They were closer to Bialystok Jewry, which was
not Polish, but rather Russian. But we — we mingled with them all. We used to go to
the — to the Ashkenazi shul, the Ashkenazi synagogue in downtown Mexico. Then,
since all the Jews left downtown Mexico, they installed themselves not far from
where we lived, maybe 10 or 15 minute walk. And that’s — we went there for a
while. My father didn’t like it, and curiously, one thing that he — he didn’t like also,
were these Hassidic Jews. But he — he and the Hassidic Jew bought a property, and
made a synagogue for themselves. But it was basically — you know, my father was a
traditionalist. He did beli — not believe in Orthodoxy, but traditional Orthodoxy.
The — the Hassidim were rather southern — southern Polish. They came — most of
them came from around Krakow. This man was — I don’t remember which ra —
rabbi he was the [indecipherable] of, but the rabbi’s center was Krakow. And
southern Poland and northern Poland at that time, were different worlds. One was
—had been Austro-Hungary, the other had been Russia, so, you know, they — they
— there was nothing to speak about, but they got along quite well there. And th-they
— he liked traditional things, and th — the Mexican community was — was torn, it
was either Sephardim, or Ashkenazim, and Ashkenazim so often were very
religious, some of them were not religious at all.

A: There was a lot of Hashomer Hatzair. This was, as I said, this was on — a very
serious problem. My mother wouldn’t send me to a Jewish school in Mexico
because it was run by Hashomer Hatzair. And you know, as they say, you know,
two Jews make three political parties, and this is a — this is basically what was
happening, it was — but it was an interesting life, 1t was — you know, the — some
people were traditional, they — they — for example, the park close to the synagogues
where we were, on Saturday morning there were circles of, you know, whatever it
is, socialists, communists, or — and they were having all kinds of discussions there,
it was — it was — it was an interesting time to be there. But Mexicans really didn’t

my uncle was not very religious, but he wouldn’t convert. So they — the tsarist
officer gave him every dirty job in — imaginable, and he took it very kindly, until
the day that the officer got really mad, and he horsewhipped him. I mean, there was
probably a foot and a half difference between he and the officer, but he grabbed the
horsewhip, and started horsewhipping the — the Russian. Of course, he didn’t even
stop for a clean shirt at home, he got the — he went to Konigsburg, from
Konigsburg he went to London. He lived in England for four or five years, and
then he moved to the United States. But the — the memory stayed with the Russian
army, and — and you had to conscript yourself into the army. The only way that you
could get yourself out of the army is if you were an only son, or there were no — no
—no other — well, only son, meaning that if — if there were no other children, or the
other siblings were women, you could be exempt from military service. So my
father did this, he had a — a cousin by the name of Efron, who had two daughters.
So when he had to go into the army, and he figured that he wasn’t going to be
treated very well, and he didn’t want to go — I mean, let’s be honest about it, he had
himself apar — adopted by this Efron.

Q: — the information in it. I had another question for you. When did your family
find out what had happened to the Jewish community in Europe, and what was that
like?
A: Well, we all — we all basically found out about 1944, when I think the “New
York Times” published a whole story. But it wasn’t only that, but you know, there
had been an awful lot of deportations, and these deported people never showed up
again. Of course, after the war, everybody started looking for — for everybody, and
they found that there was nobody left, practically. We know that my aunt, uncle and
cousin, were deported to Treblinka. It sounds like my cousin was killed before he
ever got to Treblinka, because there was a — there — the people who — who took the
— who were put on the train from Bialystok to Treblinka, were — there was a

made to walk to the — the rest of the distance, which was not — not — not a — in the

seems my cousin was — was — was killed before — before. But my aunt and uncle
were — the rest of my family managed to survive, because they were in Russia.
Q: Mm-hm, okay.
A: Or, they had left Poland. I mean, basically, my father was the sole support of his
father, and the sister, who was the mother of my cousin, and a brother who didn’t
stay very long, he — he helped my father for about 10 years, and then he went to the
United States about 1912 or ’13, or something like that. So basically we have no f
—no—no— no immediate family in Europe at that time.
Q: Okay.
A: They were either in Israel, or the United States, or — or Russia. And the ones in
Russia didn’t — they didn’t all survive. You had two uncles in Leningrad who died
in the — in the siege.
Q: Okay.
A: But I don’t know, we — we — we were very adventurous sor-sorts. I think one of
my aunts had a child, and she decided that, you know, the child should be a rabbi.

her in Jerusalem. And as a— we — we have — we have some very, very — well, you
know, the — it was an adventure to be a Jew, and people were very adventurous.
Q: Excellent.
A: We had — even my father’s oldest brother, who was a rabbi, first went to
Sweden. Couldn’t make a living being a rabbi. Put up a hat factory, and I think
wouldn’t make a — a living with that either, so he went to the United States, and the
United States, his wife didn’t like it. So he went to — to — to Israel. And he lived
quite well there. He — he — he — he was one of the founders of the Bezalel
movement, of the art movement, and he was the — he became an antiquarian.

A: And, as a matter of fact, there were three generations of antiquarians in
Jerusalem. And my — my — the — the — the last one, the cousin, anyway, she — she —
she had also a very strange life. But she left me some of the stuff that she had in — in

the war, everybody was helping everybody. For example, my father sis — this rule
that you had to have 20,000 dollars for a family, or 10,000 for an individual, people

wanted to see the deposit, and that was it, it was — they showed the deposit, the —
the money went to somebody else, or — so, you know, the — the — there was a—a
