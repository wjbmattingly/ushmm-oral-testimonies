CESARE UGIANSKIS
February 18, 2013
Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with
Mr. Cesare Ugianskis, on February 18, 2013, in Sherman Oaks, California.
Thank you Mr. Ugianskis for agreeing to speak with us today. And we’re going to
start the interview at the very beginning, so I’m going to want to know about your
childhood, your background. [Il start with those basic kinds of questions: when
were you born, who were your parents, did you have siblings. And we go from
there.
Answer: Okay, now you want me to tell that?
Q: Yes. [technical interruption]
A: My father was a Lithuanian army officer.
Q: What was his name?
A: Juozapas, or in English, Joseph Ugianskis. And he was sent to Italy to attend a
cavalry school in Pinerolo, Italy. Of course my mother was with him because he
spent several years there. And on November 18, 1929, I was born in Italy.
Interesting enough, it was on Sunday, and they couldn’t get ahold of any medical
people, so my dad called his — the doctor, the veterinarian that he knew. And I was
delivered in Pinerolo, Italy by a veterinarian. Anyway, when he was asked how
difficult it was, his answer was, it’s a hell of a lot smaller than a horse.

Interview with Cesare Ugianskis :
February 18, 2013
Q: It’s unusual for two reasons: that a Lithuanian is born in Italy, and two, that he’s
delivered by a veterinarian.
A: Anyway, after the school, we returned to Lithuania and my father continued to
serve in the Lithuanian army.
Q: That’s his cavalry school. Did — how many years — do you remember how many
years it lasted?
A: Well, I’m not exactly sure, but I would think probably sometime between ’28
and °30.
Q: Okay. So, in 1930 you come back to Lithuania, and you probably have no
memories of Italy.
A: Very foggy. In fact, when I visited Pinerolo some years ago, I recognized the
place where I was being carried around.
Q: Really?
A: Yes. But that’s all that I remembered about it.
Q: Okay. Were you the only child in the family?
A: No, I— my — my parents had six children. The oldest one died shortly after birth,
then I was the next, Cesare, born in Italy. Then my brother Roman, who was born
in Lithuania, in Kaunas. And then a sister was born, her name was Ligeia. And
unfortunately she died from one of the diseases that was spreading around, maybe

February 18, 2013
typhus or something like that. Or diphtheria. Anyway, she died at the age of five.
And then my brother Joseph, Joe was born in Lithuania. So he was 10 years
younger than I. And then a year later or so my sister was born, Grazina. She, and
we all ended up in the United States, as a family.
Q: Di— were you growing up, after you returned from Italy in Kaunas, in the
capital city at the time?
A: No. At first we lived in Alytus, Lithuania, where my father was a cavalry
officer. Only in 1939, we moved to Kaunas.
Q: Oh, so your early experiences are from Alytus.
A: That’s right.
Q: Okay.
A: That’s right.
Q: And your father, I then take it, was a professional military man.
A: That’s right, he was a professional military man. Just one — one thing about this
military career. He started out during World War II in the tsar’s army.
Q: Oh, let’s — let’s start — let’s go back a bit. Tell me about your father.
A: Okay.
Q: What kind of a person wa — where — when was he born, the date of his birth and
his name, his kind of background and how he became a military man.

February 18, 2013
A: Okay, well, I think he was born in 19 — I’m sorry 1893. And there’s a confusion
about the date because it was at that time there was the old calendar, that was
changed later. So I think his birthday is on the 18" of January in 19 — I mean, 1893.
Q: And he grew up in Lithuania?
A: In Kaunas, he grew up in Kaunas, and after they — Lithuania fought for its
independence in 19 — 1819, he was a volunteer in that army.
Q: Oh, I'd like to step — still step back a bit. If he was born in 1893, then he would
have been of draft age at what point, 17 - 18 years old in the middle of World War
I?
A: Yes.
Q: So, you mentioned he was in the tsar’s army, was he drafted into that army? Or
did he —
A: Oh yes, he was, yes he was, yes.
Q: Okay. Did he used to tell you stories of his experiences?
A: No, no.
Q: Okay.
A: He never talked about his years that he served in the — in the fight for the
Lithuanian independence. The — the only thing that I remember about it, that he was

given a—a medal which is called Wikyas(ph) kryZius. But essentially it’s the same
kind of thing that we have Medal of Honor.
Q: And what was that for?
A: It was for his bravery fighting in the — in the — with the Polish and Russian
troops.
Q: Okay. So, from the tsar’s army, after World War I ends, that’s when Lithuania
starts fighting for independence?
A: That’s right.
Q: And he changes armies?
A: That’s right, he changes armies.
Q: Okay, and he — okay.
A: He becomes an officer in the Lithuanian army, in the cavalry.
Q: I see.
A: That’s how he ended up in Italy.
Q: So, did he have the title of savanoris karys, if he was fighting for Lithuanian
independence?
A: I don’t remember the title, but ti — the title that I think of is — was savanoris —
Q: Okay.
A: — volunteer, essentially.

February 18, 2013
Q: A volunteer, okay.
A: And then he — when the war was — I mean, Lithuania gained its independence,
he ended up going to military school, and became an officer in the Lithuanian army.
Q: Okay.
A: And after that, he continued to serve.
Q: And your mother? Tell us a little bit about her. Where was she born, what was
her name?
A: Okay, my mother was born in a small village along the Nemunas river,
Ploksciai. Her father was a very successful lawyer in Lithuania and he had a large
estate in that little town. And when I was on my way, they were in Ploksciai, in that
little town and was delivered there, and th-they — they — I mean, she was born there.
And I-I think she was born in 1906, but I don’t remember the date.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: And —
Q: Do you remember the estate? Do you remember the estate?
A: Oh, the estate, yes, I do remember the estate, because I was there, trying to get
her back under the new Lithuania.
Q: Oh, I see. But when you were growing up, did you spend time on this estate?

February 18, 2013
A: I probably — I remember being there once or twice, with my mother, visiting
there.
Q: I see. So, let’s turn a little bit, and talk about your parents as — as people. What
kind of personalities did they have?
A: Well, let me just finish about my mother.
Q: Okay.
A: Her name was Krasauskita(ph), which is derived from Krasauskas(ph). And
she was fairly young when she got married to my father in 1926, I think.
Q: Okay.
A: And essentially my — my dad was a military fa — my — my family was a military
family, so we moved around. And I remember living in the place called
Myampoli(ph). That’s where — the first place I remember I lived. Then I lived in
Alytus, and then we moved to Kaunas. And when in 1940, when the Russians
essentially occupied Lithuania and Lithuania became the Socialist Republic, my
father was dra — transferred into the Red Army. So he became a lieutenant colonel
in the Red Army.
Q: Well, here’s — I have a question about that, and I’Il ask it now, and then we’ll go
back a little bit to your —
A: Okay.

February 18, 2013
Q: — to your childhood. Things like that happened, but it sounds to me rather
unusual, because many army officers, many professional military men were actually
arrested by the Soviets. So how 1s it that he wasn’t — not only not it — wasn’t he
arrested, but he becomes a military officer in the Soviet army”?
A: Well, because he never was involved in politics.
Q: I see.
A: And his father was a policeman that was killed by the Germans during World
War I. And so essentially, he came from a simple family, and he was born in a little
town on — on — along the Nemunas river. And he spoke very good Russian, because
he lived in Russia for years too, being — being — being in the service. So essentially,
he wasn’t arrested, but we found out that when — when the German occupied
Lithuania in 1941, we found out that we are in a — the family was on a list to be
deported to Siberia next week.
Q: Really?
A: Yes.
Q: So it didn’t matter that he would have been a Soviet army officer?
A: That’s right.
Q: Okay.
A: That’s right. That’s what I heard.

Q: Okay.
A: I mean, I didn’t see any paper or anything, because at that time I was too young
to decipher anything, I was essentially — in 1941 I was 11 years old.
Q: Yeah.
A: Or in 1940.
Q: So when — when you were growing up, and you moved around in different
places, was there something that was different between — you felt was different
between your family and other kids?
A: Yes, because we always have to make new friends. So it’s just kind of different,
but we — we adapted to that very quickly. It didn’t really bother us. Because
essentially we moved — we really moved with the army, you know, it wasn’t like a
new job or something. It was just o-officer being moved to a — getting another
assignment.
Q: In a different place.
A: Yeah, in a different place, so we just —
Q: Were all of your friends Lithuanian when you were growing up?
A: Yes, I would say so. Yeah, come — well, not really. There were several ethnic
Russians that lived in Lithuania that I befriended, yes.

Q: Where did your grandmother live?
A: Oh, she lived in Kaunas.
Q: Okay.
A: And she was friends with them, and they had some children there and so I would
— when I would visit my grandmother, I would play with them. And then, of course,
they disappeared in 1941.

politics, or what was going on in the world?

thing. My father was pretty adept at getting along with the government.

person.
Q: What kind of a person was he personality-wise?
A: Well, he was pretty straightforward, but pretty strict, as an officer.
Q: Was he? Yeah?
A: And when he said something to do, you did it.
Q: Was there military precision in the house?
A: No.
Q: No?
A: No, my mother was the family’s boss in the house.
Q: Oh really?
A: Yes.
Q: Yeah. And was she strict too?
A: No, she was actually very easygoing. Occasionally, you know, she kind of
pretended she was beating us, you know, and she just kind of went past the face,
you know, past the rear end, you know, and that was about it. No, she was very
gentle.

going to church very often with them.
Q: Mm-hm. What was the religion?
A: Catholics.
Q: Okay.
A: My — say one — one thing about my mother. Many years later, when I— when we
were here in the United States, my mother, and in fact her sister too, told me that in
my mother’s family, in — there was a Jew that married a Lithuanian women. And in
fact, that was a big [indecipherable] secret on the German occupation.
Q: Really?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you know who the — who the family member was that that person married?
A: No, it had to be three or four generations back.
Q: I see. So the family itself, Krasauskas(ph) family was concerned that they may
be targeted —
A: That’s right.
Q: — because there had been a Jewish relative.
A: That’s right, because there was a Jewish relative, and so nobody talked about it,
and people that knew didn’t bring it up anywhere.

February 18, 2013
Q: I see. Even though it could have been in the ni — in the 19" century.
A: That’s right. So anyway —
Q: Okay. Do you recall any kinds of — any kind of talk about Jews being different
than other people, when you were growing up?
A: Oh yes, you know, all Lithuanians considered Jews different people.
Q: Okay.
A: They still do.
Q: Okay, what do you remember from your childhood? What kind of — what kind of
views were there?
A: Well, as I say, my father was not very — he’s a very tolerant, you know, he —
Q: I’m not talking about your parents, and your family, but growing up in an
atmosphere, you know.
A: Oh — oh — oh, well it’s essentially re-really anti-Semitic judgment.
Q: Yeah.
A: That Jews, you know, take ad — take advantage of s — of — of Lithuanians. That
was sort of an idea that was spread. I think in fact th-they — the Lithuanians were
very tolerant, because in 1300s, Jews came to Lithuania because they were being
evicted from England and Germany and Austria. And they came to Poland,
Lithuania, because at that time Lithuanians themselves were — weren’t Christians.

February 18, 2013
Very tolerant, they were pagans, you know. And so th — Lithuania lived with those
Jews until u — udi — unification with Poland, in — I think in 1500s. And that’s when
Jesuits come in, and they the ones that spread all those bad stories about the Jews.
Q: And what were some of those bad stories?
A: Oh, about Jews taking the kids, rolling them in a barrel full of nails and using
their b — they blood to — to make matzo.
Q: Those were the sorts of things that you’d hear growing up?
A: That’s right, that’s right.
Q: Okay.
A: And that they were stealing things from people, you know, they were really bad
people. Of course, all it was, jealousy, because Jews were organized well, they were
well educated. And there were — of course there were poor Jews too, but — but — but
lot of them were — were well educated people. In fact, you know, there were
restrictions, you know, in the professions, like [indecipherable] get in. For
example, they couldn’t own land.
Q: Really?
A: They weren’t allowed to own land.
Q: In independent Lithuania?
A: At first, yes.

Q: And later they were allowed.
A: Yes.
Q: Yeah, mm-hm.
A: But at first, no. And in general, it was idea that the Jews in general were taking
advantage of people, so you had to be careful of them. That was sort of negative I
remember.
Q: Mm-hm. Do you —
A: On the other hand, on the other hand, there were good Jews that were friends of
my parents, you know.
Q: So that your parents socialized with different — different groups of people, not
just —

Q: Did your parents talk about their friends who were different nationalities much,
or is it just you knew them, this was — this was this person, this was that person, and
so on?
A: I’m not sure how to answer that, but my parents essentially weren’t very anti-
Semitic in many ways, I would say. They were very tolerant and they would just
shrug it off.
Q: I see.
A: And I don’t remember really my mother or father badmouthing Jews.
Q: Did — do you have memories of going to school before the war?
A: Beg your pardon?
Q: Do you have memories of going to school before the war?
A: I did?
Q: Yes.
A: Oh yes, I remember starting grammar school in 1936. I was, I guess six years old
or seven years old — six — six years old, yeah.
Q: Uh-huh.

in Germany in the 1930s, or what was going on in the Soviet Union?
A: You know, I just remember badmouthing Soviet Union, but I don’t remember
badmouthing Germany.
Q: I see. When did politics, or when did these larger events kind of impact your
own lives?
A: Well, the first time it was in 1939, when the Russians occupied — ni — 1940,
when the Russians occupied Lithuania.

A: Well, because the 26" corps of the Russian army was — became — be-became —
the Lithuanian army became 26" corps of Russian army and they were stationed in
Vilnius, so that’s how he ended up living in Vilnius.
Q: Mm-hm. Would he come back on the weekends or something?
A: Occasionally, yeah, he used to come back.
Q: Uh-huh. And did life change for other people in Kaunas after the Soviet
occupation, that you remember?
A: You know, I remember people were worrying about food supplies and sugar and
so on, because they were afraid that the Russian soldiers were buying things up and
shipping home. And so there was talk about the fact that there may be food
shortages, you know, and that — and now we won’t have any bananas, you know,
and all that. I kind of remember tho — that talk. So it was repe — pretty much
recognizing that Russia was not a — a—a wealthy place, or a good place to live.
Q: How did school life change?
A: Well, we start to study Russian.

Q: Okay. Let’s go on then. What happened after — after this occupation? What kind
of events took place?
A: Well, you know, one morning we woke up and heard planes above and some
explosions. And that was a —I think June 22" of 1941, when the Germans attacked.
Q: Was this unexpected?
A: Oh yeah, nobody expected it, I don’t think so.
Q: Okay, so it was a surprise.
A: Oh, it was a big surprise.
Q: How did everybody react?
A: Well, my father deserted, essentially. When the Russians retreated to Russia
with the army, my father stayed in Lithuania. And so —
Q: Had — and had he spoken at home anything about his views of the Red Army or
his views of — of being transferred into it, or anything like that?
A: No, I don’t remember anything — anything bad or good.
Q: Okay, so he stayed silent.

Q: Okay.
A: He didn’t express his views, political views.
Q: Okay.
A: That’s why he survived longer than many of the others.
Q: And nevertheless, one could perhaps make the assumption that he spoke with his
feet, in that he didn't use them, he stayed put.
A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, he just — he just wo — he was a survivor, political survivor.
Q: Okay.
A: By not getting involved.
Q: Okay. And so when they retreated, he did not?
A: That’s right.
Q: And what happened after that?
A: Well, interesting. He got a job in Vilnius as a commander of the famous prison

one weekend we — and we noticed he was talking to people. And he said, I’m going
back to Vilnius and I’m going to resign. And some of his friends said, well you do
that, they’re gonna send you to — to — with the Jews. He said, we’ll see. He came
back, spoke to the German supervisor, told him that his family was in Kaunas, and
he had a nice job, could he leave. And the German released him.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: Cause he said, I’m not going to participate in — in executions of Jewish people.
Q: And you remember him saying such things at home?
A: Oh yes. I remember him saying it later, you know. It — at that time he didn’t say
anything, it was only later he told us, you know, what — what his view was. And so
anyway — so — so he got a job as a saw mill director on the river Nemunas.
Q: I see.
A: And so he —
Q: Not a military job at all.
A: No, no, so he — he was in charge of a sawmill that they never did anything with
the sawmills. He became a director. He was distributing woods — wood and so on
because everything was rationed. And s — and so he stayed, so he stayed on the job
until Russians were coming back, until 1944 when we left Lithuania in August of
1944.

and I remember going to a lot of drinking parties with him. That’s one thing about
Lithuanians, you know, they were drinking heavily, and today they’re still
considered the largest consumer of liquor in the European nations.

anything going on in Kaunas when you were there?
A: Oh sure, you know, we — first thing we saw was that they were ki — pu — putting
them — making them wear Star of David, yellow Star of Davids on back and the —
in the back, on the front. And then, all of a sudden, they — they — they moved out a

Q: This is a continuation of our interview on February 18", 2013, with Mr. Cesare
Ugianskis. And when we broke off before, we were talking about 1941 — 1942 in
Kaunas, you had heard of — you had s — heard of neighbors of your grandmother’s
who were Jews, who were brought to Vilijampole Slobodka, to what became the
ghetto. You found out soon thereafter that Jews were being taken an-and shot at
various places around the city. Can you tell us a little bit about the geography of
Kaunas, and what were the old forts that were there, that ended up being execution
places?
A: Well, I'll tell you what I know, or at least I think I know. Kaunas was a city in
Lithuania that was populated by Lithuanians, and about 30 percent, I believe, at
one time, was Jewish.
Q: Okay.
A: And my parents — my — my p — my father’s parents lived in Kaunas, my
grandfather — my — my grandfather was a police officer. And in 1918 or so, when he

was arrested by the Germans, he was killed in a POW camp. So I never met him or
her — or — or saw him. And after that, what can I say? We moved to Kaunas,
because my father was transferred from Alytus to Kaunas in 1939. And soon after
we arrived in 1940, Russians came in.
Q: Well, what I’d like to do if you — if you have memories of this, or knowledge of
this, Kaunas, from what I — or Kovno, as it is known in Yiddish, is ringed, or th —
around the city is ringed by a series of forts. That’s not usual for most European
cities.
A: That’s right.
Q: Can you tell us about which — what was the historical basis of these forts?
A: Well, it was done by Catherine the Great.
Q: Okay, so tell us about these forts.
A: Well, all I know about it is the fact that there are about, I think, 12 of them
surrounding Kaunas. That’s essentially when — when — when I was alive, some of
them had certain — certain uses. Like the fort where we lived, fort five was storage.
There are a lot of — military storage, workers —
Q: What did — what did a fort look like? I mean, sometimes people will imagine a
fort as being an entire complex where people even live in it. What were these forts?
Were they like towers, or were they like —

Q: They were on level ground.
A: Level ground, and they had water surrounding them, th-they had a — whatever
you call that.
Q: A moat? A moat?
A: Yes, a moat surrounding it. And inside they had the quarters and they had
weapons, artillery and so on. But I don’t think that very many people lived there.
There lived, surrounding the fort, they had — they had buildings, and the fort that I
remember was fort number four, fort number five, fort number nine. These are the
three forts that I remember because they’re connected with — with the history in
some ways, for me.
Q: Okay, is it possible to give — [interruption]
A: So, the other forts, I don’t know what they were used for, but number — and —
and that’s right, and there was number six, I think, that was used as a prison.
Number nine —

February 18, 2013
Q: So Catherine the Great had built them.
A: They built them, they were just — sat there, because nobody attacked Kaunas,
nobody needed them. And so it was really probably a great waste of — of — of tsar’s
money to build them, but they build them, and as I say, when I was living in
Lithuania they were used as prisons and storage u — places. And —
Q: About how big would these forts be?
A: Beg your pardon?
Q: About how big would these complexes be, these fort complexes?
A: O-Okay, let me see, how ca — how to describe it? Well, it’s probably — diameter
on it probably was ha-half a kilometer, 500 meters or so.
Q: Okay.
A: And they — they — they had these build-ups, you know, in — in-inside, you know,
in and out. The kind of stuff, you know, that would protect from somebody firing at
you.
Q: Were they underground? Were they underground, too? Did they —
A: Yeah, there was some underground stuff, yes, yes.

Q: The materials that they were built from, was it brick, was it stone?
A: They had brick, brick and cement, yeah. And — and ce — and iron. Iron was — was
one of the things that they were using there. The gates, and — e-entrance to the fort,
at — at — at least the number four and five had this huge steel wall, steel fence that
they opened ev — to get in and ge — get out.
Q: Could you see through that steel fence, or was it —
A: Oh yeah, no, you could see right through it, you could see the bild — the building.
In fact, there were some quarters there and storage places, right — right after the
entrance, so they could come in with the vehicles, unload them, you know, and so
on. But then, the rest of 1t was all in and out, you know, it was just — just a lot of ins
— for — for mounting weapons, for looking through, you know. And even when I
think about it now, I’m not sure what — what they would have done with them, even
if they were attacked.
Q: Okay. Well, being built by Catherine the Great would have been that they had
been around for a couple of hundred years already, and the weaponry was — was of
a different kind.

A: That’s right. That’s right, exactly. So anyway, so that’s what I remember about
those forts. And the one that I’m most acquainted is number five, because we lived
about 200 feet from — 200 meters from — from the fort.
Q: Okay.
A: My father had a house built there on a five hectare land, it’s like 15 acres. And
so we used to go and play there.
Q: At the fort?
A: At the fort.
Q: Okay, were you allowed inside?
A: Oh, we — kids, you know, could get in anywhere.
Q: Okay.
A: So —so we’d go in there and at one time when — when — in 1941, when Germans
attacked Russia, we went in there and there was th — there was a food storage there.
And I remember loading ourselves up with cans of — of vegetables and goods, you
know, food, because there was — full of it there. And people — whole neighborhood,
you know, was coming in and going out with — with goodies.

A: Yeah, including me.
Q: Yeah. Were these forts always under some sort of governmental or municipal
control?
A: Oh yes, all the time, yes.
Q: Okay, so they’ve never been privatized?
A: No, they just — I’m not sure if the other forts were wide open like the fifth one
was. Fourth one, of course, was always kind of closed up because they always had
the — I think something going on, you know, with — with prisons or something like
that. But —

actually, number five, this is where the most of the Jews were killed.
Q: In fort number five?

A: Okay, well, at one — this is during the summer now, so we’re loose, on summer
vacation. And so for nothing better to do, we used to come and visit my father in the
— in the sawmill, and go in swimming in the river. And so along the river one time, I
— coming in from — toward us, along the river Nemunas, we saw this — this huge
crowd moving. And we said, well, let’s take a look what it is. So wen — we went up
there, and what it was, it was actually most people were ha — we-wearing the yellow
David star, meaning that they were Jews. And they were young people and young —
and — and small children, and ladies and — and men, older men mostly. And they
were marching towards [indecipherable] towards number four fort. So we decided
to follow them, and so we saw them move this huge crowd into the fort. And then
we kind of cut behind there and we stood on the outside edge of the moat, and we
could see inside. And we saw this — these people in a single row, moving in, and
throwing in their belongings in a pile.
Q: So, in other words, outside of the fort, there was an elevation that was even
higher than the — than the walls of the fort itself?
A: That’s right, a little bit higher, yes.
Q: And you could stand on that and — and look in?
A: Outside?
Q: Yeah.

There were higher places in the fort itself.
Q: Okay.
A: But we were looking down in the fort from the moat.
Q: I see, okay.
A: And so we were looking down in the fort, and we could see this single row of
people going and throwing in whatever they were carrying with them, you know.
And —
Q: Were they undressing?
A: Well, I don’t really think they were undressing there, I think they undressed
later. But — but they were throwing in their goods there. And then they marched in
there and after awhile, we started hearing gunfire, you know, and we realized what
was going on, they were shooting them. And all of a sudden we saw this guard tar —
running toward us, you know, coming toward us. So we realized that they don’t
want us here. So we started running and they kept on yelling stop, and we just took
off. And of course, you know, being younger and faster, just took off and knew —
we knew where we were going, they didn’t. And so we escaped. But — but that’s
when we realized that that’s what it was, you know, this is — probably — I guess this
i— this was probably early August of 1941.

Q: Okay.
A: And then, you know, we sort of heard that there were some more shootings there
after that, but not very much. But there were continuous shooting apparently going
on in fort number nine. I mean, we heard about it. We couldn’t hear, but we heard
about it. Well anyway, what happened then was that, let’s see, about 1944, about
February, the Germans got a whole bunch of Russian war pr — prisoners of war, and
they were starting to dig up — that’s what we heard from other people, I didn’t see it
— that they were digging up the bodies, putting them in piles and setting them on
fire. Well, what I remember about that was that when the wind was downwin — we
were — lived downwind, we got this horrible smell of human bodies burned —
burning.

A: No, no, no, just — just toward our for — toward — toward us [indecipherable] the

windows?
A: No, no, we were standing on the — on the outside on the moat and looking in.

a darker uniform.
Q: Okay, but was the uniform a German issued uniform?
A: Oh, I’m sure it was German — German created.
Q: I see.
A: Or German by — created by German orders, because during the fort — between
41 and 44, the Germans had organized battalions an-and regiments out of the
Latvians and — and — and — and Estonians. And they had SS [indecipherable].
Lithuanians didn’t agree to that. They were called savisagorse(ph), self-defense

A: I don’t remember, no.
Q: Okay.
A: No, I don’t think so.
Q: Okay.
A: I don’t think so. I think we stayed away from all those. See, we lived on the
outskirts, number four — five fort 1s on the outskirt of Kaunas and it was pretty
empty there. You know, there was a couple of — like I want to say five homes
probably, around where I lived, you know, and so nobody went by there.
Q: How did life progress for your family during these occupation years, between
41 and °44?
A: Well, actually wasn’t as bad as it could have, because my father had a good job,
and he provided money to buy food for us on the black market. So we — we wou —
my mother would go to Shaunshai(ph), to the black market there and buy food for
the money my father had.
Q: Well, you had a pretty big family.
A: Well, yeah. So we actually, I m—I must admit, I think we lived, during the 1941

On the radio we could hear that the — that the Russians were now at the Ukraine
and Russians were now in Belarus, you know. And then we could — started to hear
the echoes of the — of the weapons, you know, the cannons. We could hear cannons
firing and exploding. And so, my father realized that there’s no way for us to stay
because essentially he’s a deserter from the Red Army. So what can we do? So my
father fou-found some friends in the self-defense force, who issued him some sort
of a paper that — that would allow us to go through the border into Germany.
Q: So, was this the same self-defense force that had been taking — was this the same
self-defense force —
A: Yes.
Q: — that would have taken part in these executions?
A: Oh yes, oh yes, the same — same people.
Q: Okay.
A: So anyway, so they took us to Dresden, Germany. But my father was supposed
to go back, and become a commander in the f — some town or something. But, on
the way there, Russians occupied Lithuania, so he came back, and we ended up
working in a factory, Seidel Naumann factory that you — before the war used to
make sewing machines, right now was making pieces for — for military purposes. In

Q: Really?
A: Yeah, that’s — and so anyway — and then we got bombed out.

Q: Upkeep of what kind of a yard?
A: Factory yard.
Q: A factory yard.
A: Ye-Ye — yeah, right. You see, they — they were making also some sort of
military parts. And I got a job there as a — as a apprentice in — in their apprentice
school, metalworking apprentice school. And so we were working there until we —
again we heard the guns firing around, you know, and we started going toward
Germany, trying to go south, you know, to — to get to — to the western forces,
because my father didn’t want to get overrun by the Russians, you know.

A: Oh yeah, I saw —
Q: Tell us what you saw.
A: I came back to Dresden about — I would say about two weeks after the — the
huge bombings. And in fact, my brother and I. And we walked down to the center
of the town. And there was this pile, you know, covered up with burlaps, you know,
and — and we thought, what the hell is this? So we went to take a look. It was a pile
probably six meters high, so — so like 18 feet or so, of bodies. Dead bodies. Burned
bodies, but dead bodies, just a pile.
Q: And nothing was being done, they were being burned, or —
A: Well, they were just sitting there, they were — obviously they got collected, but
no — but you know, they were probably digging out other people too, you know. But
that’s what we saw. And we walked around, and we just couldn’t believe you know,
all those beautiful buildings, they’re all gone, you know, in the center of — of
Dresden. And so we of course came back — came back to Dippoldiswalde the same
day.
Q: But I — again I want to stay with this a bit. You were still on the outskirts of
Dresden as it was being bombed?
A: Yes.

A: No, I— no, no, I was in a plant.
Q: And it was being bombed, that plant.
A: Yes, yes. And the building above us collapsed, but lucky for us, it didn’t break
through down to the basement. So we were able to walk out after the building
collapsed, but didn’t collapse into the basement. And so we came out of the
basement when the fire was burning around.
Q: And was it only the workers of the factory who were there, or whole families?
A: Well most — my — my — my mother was there, she was injured. As a matter of
fact, my mother was somewhere else because we were at work, so we were
somewhere else. And so we came home in the day, we couldn’t find our mother. So,
few days later we started looking for her. And so we walked in on one of the nearer
hospitals and sure enough we found her in hallway. She already had gangrene set in
on her leg, but luckily not far enough, and we got the doctors to take care of her so
— so sh — they didn’t have to amputate her leg or anything, so she survived the
bombing. She’s the only one in our family that was hurt during the World War II.
Q: And it was at the bombing of dre — Dresden?
A: Yeah.

Q: Right.

Q: Yeah. And so —
A: And then my father, he was ahead of me f — because somehow we separated, he
was ahead of me, and he went into the doorway. And when they were firing, you
could see the bullet hits right around there where he stood, but — but 1t wouldn’t hit
him because he was in a doorway, so he didn’t get hit. We were a lucky family.
Q: Yeah.
A: So anyway, so then we started hearing the shooting outside the Dippoldiswalde,
and we decided to get out.

grain and sugar, and stuff like that. And we walked for two weeks from che — from
— to Czechoslovakia, all the way to the American zone. And when we got to
American zone, the American soldiers stopped the traffic. They wouldn’t let people
go across the bridge. And my father said, this is something screwy. He walked off
the road, talked to a farmer, and asked him was there another way to get to — get out
of here. He said yes, take this d-dirt road here, walk up, you know, two kilometers,
turn left and you’ ll walk into the road that goes right into Germany. So my father
says, we’re not going to wait and listen to these Americans. So we walked, we get
to the border and we see a soldier guard, American guard walking around. My
father looked around, he says, let’s go, he won’t bother us, he’s talking to a girl.
Sure enough, we walked, he just kind of — I don’t know if he even saw us, probably
he didn’t. And we just walked in and sure enough, that night Americans withdrew
from Czechoslovakia and Russians took over.
Q: Oh my goodness.
A: So I keep on saying, you know, we were the luckiest family in World War II, to
survive things like that. So anyway, so we ended up in little town called Selb, lived
there for a month or two, then moved to a little town called [indecipherable] town

it’s — hm, go into the room there if you want to, and see — see if you can see a

A: Okay, okay.
Q: Did you get married in the United States?
A: Yes.
Q: Okay, tell me a little bit about your — the family that you created together.
A: Well, I married a Lithuanian girl from Chicago. And we were married for about
37 years, and then she just one day departed. Just left me a note, and that was it.
And we had one daughter, who went to UCLA, got a Bachelor’s degree there, and
then got Master’s degree in connectic — Connecticut — kinesthesiology. That’s the
study of human body. And then ended up at medical school at Northwestern and
became interventional radiologist.
Q: Wow. Wow. What was your profession?

February 18, 2013
A: I was an engineer, electrical engineer. I worked for Hughes Aircraft for 29
years.
Q: Okay. You mentioned earlier, before we had our interview, that your former 1n-
laws also had had some experience with having witnessed some parts of the
Holocaust in Lithuania.
A: Well, they part — essentially participated in a part of Holocaust.
Q: Okay, tell us about that.
A: Okay, my father-in-law Darsha(ph) Starkus told me the story.
Q: Okay.
A: He and a guy by the name of Belkinus(ph) went to medical school together. And
the Belkinus(ph) was a Jew. And so then, by coincidence, they — he — Dr. Starkus
ended up as a district doctor of this small district in — in Lithuania, around
Diletus(ph).
Q: Okay.
A: And it turned out to be Belkin(ph) ended up there too. And they used to get
together occasionally. Well, one day, when they started pe — pushing people into the
ghettos, my father-in-law, Dr. Starkus was going to work, and he saw Dr.
Belkin(ph) with his wife and a daughter, with suitcases going towards the railroad
station. He said, where you going? Well, Vilijampole. He said, you know what’s

going on there, don’t go. He says, where can I go? Come with me. He took the
family to his sister-in-law house and put them up there. In the meantime, as a doctor
of that district, he became friends with a German — with a German commander of
the town, or of the district. And he used to come occasionally to visit and for dinner.
Well, one day he came in, you know, and he says, I’ve got to leave early today
because we have to go to south side of Aytus to arrest Jews that are people housing.
Q: No kidding.
A: So the German one way, the father-in-law the other, ran over to that sister-in-
law’s house, put the people in a car and drove them to another place, and then the
following day he found a place to put them with a f— some of his acquaintance that
had a farm next to th — to — to the woods — to the fl — you know. And apparently
they built a double wall somewhere where they could hide if somebody came. And
Dr. Belkin(ph) and his wife stayed there, but the d-daughter, they couldn’t keep her
there. So Dr. Starkus arranged with a priest to give him a birth certificate of — of a
dead girl as hers. And he put up with — with — with an older lady, a friend of his, or
a — someone he knew. And that’s how they survived the war.
Q: So the whole Belkin(ph) family —
A: The whole Belkin(ph) family survived. And the little girl was — was — was
christened to be a Christian — Catholic, by the lady. Anyway, they had a little hard

time — well, of course, and then the Russians came. And of course Dr. Belkin(ph)
and his wife survived and their little daughter survived. And the little — they had the
little trouble getting the girl back because the woman didn’t want to give her up,
after three years or so.
Q: You get attached.
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: Anyway, so then, of course, it worked out fine and —
Q: Do you know if they stayed in Lithuania, the Belkin(ph) family?
A: Well, when the lady that — the lady that housed them in Alytus, Dr. Starkus’
sister-in-law died, and I went to her funeral there and Mrs. Belkin(ph) was there, I
think Dr. Belkin(ph) by then was dead. And she died shortly after that, I think. Her
daughter, the young lady, still survives and she lives in Vilnius.
Q: Does she?
A: And she’s married, you know, lives in Vilnius, has her own family.
Q: And she still lives in Lithuania?
A: Yeah. That’s the last I heard.
Q: Okay. Now the funeral that you’re talking about, what year was that funeral?

93?
A: Some — somewhere around there, yeah.
Q: Yeah.
A: But he wasn’t at the funeral, but s — but his wife was there.
Q: Okay.
A: So I saw her and met her.
Q: Okay.
A: Just said hello and that was about it.
Q: Okay. Did she know of your connection?
A: No, I don’t think so. I’m not sure. I kind of doubt it.
Q: Okay, okay. And —
A: I kind of doubt it.
Q: — did anybody — Mr. Starkus, what happened with him?
A: Well, Dr. Starkus — after we got married, Dr. Starkus retired at the age of some
— 70 something and moved to Santa Monica, and lived here until he died in the
early 90s.

A: Oh no, late 90s, I guess.
Q: Late 90s.
A: Yeah, late 90s, yeah. And then his wife survived for another two years, died in
Hawaii, and they’re buried here in Los Angeles.
Q: Do you know whether or not they were ever recognized by Yad Vashem, as
being Righteous Amongst Gentiles?
A: You know, I used to go to some meetings, you know, and I met a Jewish fellow
who was part of the organization here, the Holocaust or whatever you call it, here in
Los Angeles.
Q: The Museum of Tolerance?
A: Yeah, something, you know, he was member of that. And I kind of told him the
story, so he wanted to talk to Dr. Starkus. Dr. Starkus refused. He didn't want to
talk about it.
Q: Really?
A: You know, there are some things that happened, I think when the Russians came
and liberated Lithuania from the Germans. But Dr. Belkin(ph) became a doctor in
Alytus in — in the prison there. And the lady that I’m talking about that — that
housed these — these people, her husband was arrested and shot there. And they
were all upset, you know, that he didn’t help him. They think he didn’t help him,

my opinion is he could not help them. But anyway — and so that kind of broke up
the friendship.
Q: I see.
A: Because he participated in the — in the execution of — of daw — of Byerchus(ph).
Q: What was the name of the family?
A: Byerchus(ph).
Q: Byerchus(ph)?
A: Yeah.
Q: Byerchus(ph).
A: Byerchus(ph), he was — he was caught by the Russians in a bunker —
Q: Okay.
A: —1n Lithuania, he was a partisan.
Q: Okay.
A: And so somebody, you know, squealed on them, and th — and the Russians found
them and essentially took him in and killed him.
Q: Yeah.
A: SO.
Q: It’s complicated.

Q: It’s complicated.
A: So I think that sort of put some friction there, between the families.
Q: I see.
A: And I think — I personally think it’s unjustified, because there is nothing he could
have done.
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: But that’s — that’s the story there.
Q: Is —
A: That’s what I know.
Q: Yes, I understand. Is there anything else that you would like to add to what
we’ ve spoken about, about these events, these historical events? You know, what
kind of inter — why your interest was piqued and maybe other people’s wasn’t?
A: Well, I don’t know. I think the fact that when I found out that there was a Jewish
connection in my family, I — I got interested, you know, and tried to track it and I
couldn’t get anywhere, in Lithuania. You know, because the documents were kept
very poorly and so on, and — and so, no I couldn’t track anything down. But, in
general, I got interested in it, and the more I read, the more interested I got, you
know, to find out what — what went on. And so I— I—I read quite a few books, you
know, and — and in fact I just finished, some time ago, a book about a thousand

pages which is a diary of a Jewish lawyer that survived all these wars, and ended up
in Israel and then depa — and then become internationally known as a la-lawyer and
so on. Well, he wrote — he preserved most of his diary from those days in Kaunas
ghetto.
Q: Do you remember his name?
A: No.
Q: Did you read it in English or in Lithuanian?
A: In English, in English, it’s a big book, and I can’t even — I think it just says diary
something.
Q: Diary of the Kovno ghetto.
A: I can find out what was [indecipherable] But anyway —
Q: Does the name Tory mean anything to you?
A: Beg pardon?
Q: Does the name Tory mean any —
A: Yes! That’s it.
Q: Avraham Tory.
A: That’s right. That’s it, that’s the guy, that’s his diary.
Q: What did you learn from that diary that you hadn’t known before?

Interview with Cesare Ugianskis °
February 18, 2013
A: Well, I learned what — what happened, how the life went on there. Because, you
know, we didn’t see it, you know. Things went on [indecipherable] inside, you
know, and — and we see ok — you know, like we used to see was groups of Jews
being escorted from one place to another. That’s about all we saw, you know, in
yellow stars. And as I say, you know, my mother got stopped because she looked
Jewish [indecipherable] they wanted to know where her star was. So —
Q: Why do you think some people are interested in this in Lithuania and other
peoples aren’t?
A: I don’t know. I don’t know. I just became interested, you know, and the more I
read, the more interested I got. And so essentially — a little while back
[indecipherable] published a little review of a book by this woman, and I just
started reading it.
Q: I think it must be Ellen Cassedy’s book.
A: Yes.
Q: Yes.
A: Yes, yes, it is. That’s right, that’s what I have.
Q: It’s called, “We Are Here.”
A: Yeah, I started reading it.
Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: Yeah, so anyway, and that [indecipherable] diary, I gave it to a friend of mine,
so he is reading it.
Q: Here in the Lithuanian community?
A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, Remus(ph) Kaminskas(ph), yeah. He is reading it. I think
that’s who I gave it to, yeah, I think it’s Remus(ph). So anyway — so that’s why —
how I developed interest you know, in — in following genocide, and then especially
Lithuanian.
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: And being quite aware, in Lithuania of — of mo — mo — the opinion that people
spread about the Jews, you know, that’s a — and I think it was primarily jealousy,
because Jews, you know, well organized people, they helped each other, opened up
businesses, were successful. And by golly, you know, people said well, you know,
Jews are taking it over. Well, sure they taking over. Why? Because they work and —
and — and — and create, and get educated.
Q: What would you want — what would you want young Lithuanians in Lithuania
to know about what went on there?
A: Well, I think that somebody could create a — a — a seminars or something about
it, but — but I’m not sure that it would work.
Q: Why?

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection
Interview with Cesare Ugianskis a
February 18, 2013
A: Well, you know, I guess now is there’s some guilt in among the Lithuanians, you
know. Because let’s face it, you know where the Holocaust started?
Q: Where?
A: Lithuania.
Q: Really?
A: Read the — read that Cassedy’s book.
Q: Okay, okay.
A: That’s what it tells you.
Q: Okay.
A: That’s where it all started.
Q: Why do you think it started in Lithuania?
A: Well, because they started executing people first, even before the Poles did.
That’s why.
Q: I don’t know that Poles executed Jews. I think it was just that concentration
camps were in Poland.
A: Well, I don’t know, I don’t know. It’s probably Germans with — with other help.
Q: Yeah, yeah.
A: I think there was a battalion of Lithuanians that participated in that.
Q: In —1n Poland?

February 18, 2013
A: Well, I’m not sure in Poland, but I know in Lithuania.
Q: Oh yes, oh yeah, uh-huh.
A: Yeah, I don’t know about Poland, no I don’t know about Poland. But — but
essentially, years ago, it was haven for the pole — for the Jews to come, because
people were tolerated. And then it became anti-Semitic place because there were so
many of them there, and they were — and they were keeping themselves, you know,
as a separate class, and then hatred developed. Or I should say, you know,
misunderstanding or whatever you want to call, developed between the two groups,
because essentially, Jew was not Lithuanian, he was Jew. He just lived here. That’s
the way they looked.
Q: Yeah.
A: You know? Even today they think they look the same way.
Q: So, Pll — I'll repeat the question a bit of a different way. If you were sitting here
with a 16 or a 17 year old Lithuanian kid who’s now growing up on the streets and
in the places where all of these things happened, what would you want to tell them?
Because you were an 11 year old kid when it was happening?
A: Well, I would ask him if he’s interested to hear about it.
Q: Okay.

somebody that doesn’t want to listen?
Q: That’s true. That’s true.
A: SO.
Q: What do you think we need to do in order to have people want to listen?
A: Well, you know, I think there’s a process in Lithuania gaining — getting people
to — to understand the — th-the — the unity of people to understand the relationship
among the people, because [indecipherable] way, part of the Euro — European usa
— union. People are interchanging, people are all mixing. And I think that’s
assimilation process. And I think that’s — that’s gonna help. You know, Lithuania’s
losing people to immigration. The number of Lithuanian pop-population has
decreased.
Q: That’s true.
A: I think it’s around 500,000 people have left, out of three million.

years old.
Q: We know. We know. And if sa — if I wo — someone asked me what do I
remember when I was 11 years old, it would not be easy for me to recall. So I —I
understand. But clearly some of these — some of these things, particularly what you
witnessed at the fort, are of such — of such a tragedy and, you know, import that at —
that’s the sort of thing that stays with you.
A: Well, people are beginning to ignore and forget it. You know, people don’t like
to remember bad things.
Q: Yeah. But it’s part of what it — it’s part of what happened.
A: You know. For example, I don’t want to recall th-the time my wife left me.
Q: Of course, of course.
