And they were sometimes held at a storefront. But we belonged to a conservative synagogue in Vienna when I was growing up.

They killed Dollfuss, who was a chancellor, in tr \u2014 in trying to do it, but that was aborted, and the Austrian government was able to arrest and \u2014 and kill some of the people who tried to overthrow the government, and this \u2014 and that time outlawed the Nazi party.
