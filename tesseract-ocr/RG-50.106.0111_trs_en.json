            "answer": "Well, I really couldn\u2019t support myself because I knew very little English, like please and thank you, good morning and some [indecipherable]. My husband, who was a physician and knew English and some other languages, got a job in Casualty Hospital in Washington, D.C. driving the ambulance, and he got 50 dollars a month and room and board. So with 50 dollars a month my little girl and I stayed an apartment house where he paid 12 dollar a week. So that\u2019s \u2014 because we could not \u2014 the only thing we could take with us was eight dollars per person. We had 24 dollars with us. So that th \u2014 took a long time til we were able to \u2014 even to move into a room and s \u2014 and use kitchen facilities. But you know, we \u2014 it somehow, with this Holocaust survivors, I think most of us did not expect that the government or different places will take care of us. So it was a very difficult time and my little girl and I went to Americanization school to learn English. And we met a lot of other refugees and came through France with some of them. And little by little we got to know some of the physicians and we were 1n-invited a lot, and it was very difficult. If you don\u2019t \u2014 if you don\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t reciprocate, you feel rather badly about. And we came to visit one of the doctors, and the doctor\u2019s wife said, oh, go up the steps, on the bedroom you put your coat on, and the bathroom is there. So I looked at myself, I said, what\u2019s wrong with me, you know, is my petticoat hanging out, how do I look? But sh \u2014 sh \u2014I didn't realize that people want to make you comfortable, as you know where the bathroom is, or where you can put your coat.

It took a long time to be comfortable, to ask somebody. Now I will ask, oh, you have a lovely bag. If you\u2019re finished with it, you don\u2019t it, give it to me. Or I go \u2014 I dr \u2014I dro \u2014 drove by, and \u2014 some friend, three in the afternoon and I was hungry and I would visit a friend and I s\u2014 and I-\u2014I said, Jean, I\u2019m so hungry, what do you have in your refrigerator? But I had a Visa, I could si\u2014 and I had some dollar bills, and I could buy something, but it \u2014 it \u2014 it was different now, that I could ask people to do or give me something. But when we first came it was very depressing to have to ask. We went in New York to try to get sponsors for some family in France and it was in August, in September, it was very, very hot. And when we walked into somebody\u2019s and they offered a glass of water, as you did right now, we said no thank you. We didn\u2019t even want to accept a glass of water, we felt so \u2014 s-so bad about ourself that we couldn\u2019t [indecipherable]. So it was very wonderful that so many people gave affidavits. They didn't even know the family, or they didn\u2019t \u2014 they had the s-same name or something, you know, and \u2014 and it was really wonderful the way, particularly the very poor Jews in \u2014 the poorer class, you know. Of course, they had to have a certain income, or a t-tax return to show that they would be able to \u2014 to support or \u2014 or help \u2014 help the people. So it was a very di-difficult time."

People were not so \u2014 so interested in \u2014 in what had happened, and a \u2014 it was very little known, you know. Even we didn\u2019t know too much about. We were very fortunate to leave \u2014 Hitler marched in on the 13\" of March, and we were very fortunate to leave the beginning of July, you know. So \u2014 but my husband had, as a physician, really terrible experiences. He could not treat Jewish people at all, or \u2014 or in \u2014 not \u2014 he couldn\u2019t, not Jewish, Gentile people, but Jewish people he could treat.

So he knew all these and he was very, very depressed, but it was very difficult for him to get ready to leave, much more somehow than it was for me.

But now, since that \u2014 it has changed my attitude since that interview and also I did not realize that I \u2014 that I am considered a Holocaust survivor. I didn\u2019t \u2014 never, never occurred to me to be in the same category. But now I feel that I have a voice, I can do something and I\u2019m very fortunate that I have that Montessori education, or early childhood education that I was doing so much in the United States, was very successful. I got the gold medal for my work in America for the \u2014 in Montessori. I got [indecipherable] what do you call it, gold medal from the \u2014 from the embas \u2014 from Austria. I got my citizenship back, and I have a voice. Being angry, it \u2014 1t does not help. So I feel now that since the \u2014 all my writing, I have written about 18 \u2014 not \u2014 not high class and not people who made the best seller list, but they helped the people, the poor people that I worked in Mississippi to write and be able to vo \u2014 to vote."

            "answer": "Well, w-w \u2014 in Vienna, you know, after the first World War, we began to ask ourselves, what is wrong with education, what has to be done? And we were young people and so we wanted to change the world. So Montessori was brought, she was a physician from Italy and she brought the Montessori method to Vienna. So we all ran to these lectures and got a \u2014 a book that sh \u2014 the first book she wrote and so on. And you had, in Vienna you had to do first your exam as a kindergarten teacher, you know, and then you could specialize in [indecipherable] in Montessori. So I took the \u2014 the training, then when I got married, I opened up a kindergarten, and I \u2014 cause I had the middle or the upper middle class children. I did not have the poor \u2014 the poor ones as I really had here in America. So na \u2014 when I first came, it took a long time til I learned enough English to take some of the tests that were necessary to establish myself.

So first I got different jobs in special education, because at that time in the early sh \u2014 the special education was on the lower bottom of the education. So \u2014 so when I applied they were happy to \u2014 to get me to take care of the special class children. And then they were very surprised the big success, because I was bootlegging Montessori.

Children are \u2014 are not expected because they\u2019re six years old that they be reading, or three years old. We don\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 in aclassroom we have children from three to six, for instance, because a three year old one might be able to read, or a four year old one, but unable to kick a ball or something than a six year one. So they\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s a such \u2014 like in a family. We do a different classroom arrangement. So we don\u2019t have this is the class two years old, or four year one, we have them \u2014 we have now infants\u2019 classes too, you know. So this is one of the things.

We have little rugs for the children, and they put their toys on that rug, and this is his territory. So they have to learn territorial rights. It\u2019s laid out the way, like a library with the books and stuff. You just can\u2019t take out a book and then, oh, I want to read the book. We have to return it to there, and th-th-then next child can. So that the \u2014 he learns in \u2014 the way a classroom and the way the whole thing is handled, he learns the rules for society. So, th-this is a very im \u2014 important, and the different expectations for the parents too, to \u2014 to understand that, you know\u201d? And the teacher is not called a teacher, she is a directress, she directs activities. She doesn\u2019t sit at her desk and the children come in, she has to be like a hostess, stand at the door, greet the children. And as she greets them, says Esther, you have a lovely dress and your hair is done so nice. Oh, and you have such a doll. And Esther says, oh my grandma came and she brought me that doll. So you know from that, that the child will want to walk around the classroom, show the doll to her. She doesn\u2019t want to disturb. And then there comes Jim, and Jim is so sad.

And there was Nancy Rambush(ph) arrived, an American who had studied the method in \u2014 in \u2014 1n Paris and so on.

In the beginning we got a lot of teachers from India, because Montessori was, for years she was in India, because she was Italian citizen and she would not follow \u2014 what was the name in \u2014 I forgot his name.

Because they are the one who might really feel that they could be Nazis again. [break]"

And it\u2019s still \u2014 some research must be going on because these children and grandchildren can grow up being hateful and continue that. So it\u2019s not only, you know, we have to reach out for the \u2014 the victim, and yeah, the non-victims, like the \u2014 one wrote a book, very famous. I can\u2019t think about his name, an Austrian. Not the \u2014 not the one who kills you, but the one who was killed. How \u2014 how 1s his responsibility [indecipherable] you know? It\u2019s \u2014 in German it sounds [indecipherable] taught about the theater, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 is responsible too.

            "question": "I'd like you to reflect back on your life and tell me what do you think has been the greatest contribution that you made to America?",
            "answer": "Well, that I was able to teach many to read and \u2014 and write. I invited my child\u2019s [indecipherable] invited him to one of the conferences, Montessori conferences as a speaker, you know, to come. So, to see that im \u2014 it was very much for us, but for him too, and for the other, to see the in \u2014 importance that he \u2014 even he doesn\u2019t have the academic education, but what he could do for people, you know? And this is very important. When I had the \u2014 the 90\" birthday, and that embassy gave a party. So I invited the chef, we had a black chef and I invited some of these people who \u2014 who bathed me, or feed me or do things, to sh \u2014 and they were all in different This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

To see \u2014 and I didn't invite so much of that white staff because they\u2019re collecting the \u2014 the checks and stuff like that. But to show, you know, how w-we are dependent on \u2014 on the non academia to keep us alive and going. And so America has an \u2014 a long way to go too, to accept, you know, other nationalities, because we have here, right in the Chevy Chase house, right, a United Nations now. You have seen different customs and different languages, and they have to learn to work together and to \u2014 and they\u2019re poor \u2014 some have very poor English language. And you learn then \u2014 when you go to English classes, you don\u2019t learn, give me eggs over on, or \u2014 or make my bass this way, or you know th \u2014 this \u2014 every day vocabulary is not taught for people, you know. So they have a difficult \u2014 we have a difficult time to understand them [indecipherable]. So I'll \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I mean it \u2014 there\u2019s so many changes in that \u2014 just in the medical technology because in my family is so many doctors. And my husband was a physician and my grandson. I mean, from the \u2014 the little thermometer in your mouth now [indecipherable] you know. And the \u2014 the medical technology is incredible, you know, that we have now. And food and so on. But more and more we have to learn th-the \u2014 that we\u2019re the brother\u2019s keeper and the responsibility that each of us have, the one that \u2014 who is preparing that \u2014 with canning, that he is \u2014 really everything is clean, because we don\u2019t know now who cans, or who builds that car, so many people, who is responsible?

My grandchildren said the spinning wheel is an antique now, that would be too costly for me to \u2014 for them to buy it for me. You know, I \u2014 everything becomes very difficult. I had a professor in Vienna in psychology, and he said, once a man, twice a child. Of course at that time he didn't know about women\u2019s liberation. And I feel that we\u2019re really like children, you know, if PIl forget where I put it and \u2014 and you know, and that brings me that research 1s now going on how Montessori can be used for Alzheimer patient.
