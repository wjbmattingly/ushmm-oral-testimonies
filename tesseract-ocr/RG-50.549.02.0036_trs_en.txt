Interview with Leo Hanin
January 22, 1999
Beginning Tape One, Side A
Question: This is an interview with Leo Hanin, conducted by Ginger Miles, on January
22nd, 1999, in Los Angeles, California. This is a follow up interview to a United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum videotape interview conducted with Leo Hanin, in 1990. The
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for
making this interview possible. This is tape one, side A.
Answer: Nothing?
Q: This is one minute of silence --
A: Okay.
Q: -- in our location.
A: I have -- People, some of the people know me by four different first names. Why? How
did it happen? When I was born, I was born in Lithuania, in a city called Vilnus. My parents
were Orthodox Jews. They named me in Yiddish, which was -- the name was in my birth
certificate, which was in Yiddish and in Polish, began with the name Labe. Labe in Yiddish
means lion. It’s a typical, Jewish sounding name. So, when we came to China, I was three
years old and I -- when I was about five, I went to a Russian school to study the Ru-Russian
language and all the other subjects. I -- I didn’t want to say that my name was Labe, because
it sounded too Jewish, with anti-Semitism and other things, I didn’t want to be outstanding.
So when they asked me what my name is, I said, “My name is Lowah or Leve, which in

Russian means lion. That’s how I went through the Russian school. Then, when I was 17,
my -- my father told me, said -- advised me -- suggested that I go to studying in a British
school in Shanghai to st -- to learn the English language, which he said 1s important in order
to get a job, in order to go ahead in life. So I went to Shanghai, I went to the British school.
I didn’t want to tell them neither my Yiddish name nor my Russian name, because it doesn’t
sound good. So I said my name, I became Leo, which means, in English, lion, same thing as
the other two names. And that’s how I stayed, for many, many, many years, until, in 1948,
beginning of ‘49, we had to leave for Israel. When I came to Israel, I was drafted into the
army and when they asked me what my name was, I said, “Leo.” They said, “Well, you
have to change your name, this is not a Hebrew name.” He said, “You, from now on you
will be Arie,” A-r-i-e, which in Hebrew means lion. So, that’s the same name and that’s
how I stayed and I said, “I don’t want to change it any more.”’ When I came to America,
Arie, my social security is Arie, my driver’s license is Arie, everything is Arie. Some people
suggested, “Go on, change it, become Leo.” I said, “No. Enough of that.” I had some
problems by the way, when I was working on my visa to come to the United States, I was in
Tokyo -- I will tell you about it later. So, the -- the lady who was asking me questions, her
name was Miss Bernard, in the -- in the American embassy, said, ““What is this, how can one
man has to have four names?” I explained to her, she says, ah, they don’t -- she didn’t -- I
said, “I tell you what. Ill bring you a letter from the Israeli embassy in Tokyo, that will say
that these four names mean the same thing in different languages.” That was acceptable.
And that’s it. That’s how my name was.

A: Yeah. But I -- M-My documents, my checks, my social security, everything, everything I

Q: But do your -- What do your children call you?
A: Dad.

Q: So it’s all right if I call you Leo?
A: Of course it’s all right.
Q: So if -- if you don’t mind, if we could just back up a little bit and name your mother and
even her maiden name.

place where we lived, Shanghai. She was born in Harbing, which is another city in China.

A: Oh yes, Russian Jewish, her background. Her name was Rebecca Lubarski, Interesting
how I met her. She was a pretty young girl, about 14 or so, I was 17 or 18 and during the
high holidays -- in Shanghai at that time, there was no synagogue -- during the high
holidays, the Jewish community, our older people, got together and rented an apartment
where they conducted the prayers for the Jewish high holidays, New Year and the Day of
Atonement. And I -- I used to attend those services. At that time I was already working in an
importing firm in -- they -- they gave me a job. I clerk in the office to learn the business.
They were importing from England, from Germany, from Poland, textiles. Woolen textiles,
there was a big market in China for textiles. And from England they imported some
artificial silk, printed with beautiful red flowers. And it -- 1t was nice red flowers and I
remember it. And then when I went to these services one day, I saw a -- a young, pretty girl
in a dress with a red -- that material that we imported. That was such a surprise. And I
looked at material and I said, ““That’s our material.” Then I looked at her. I said to a friend
of mine, I says, ““That’s the girl I like to meet. I think I’m going to marry her.” And I did, six
years later.
Q: Oh.
A: Was a very interesting story.
Q: Did you go over to her that day?
A: No, no, I didn’t go with her that day, I met her later in a -- in a organization for young
Jewish people. We met and then I started to take her out to the movies, etcetera, etcetera,
etcetera. [indecipherable]

Q: You had a courtship for --
A: Oh yes, for a long time, about six years.
Q: Six year courtship, wow.
A: I was 17. Because in 1933, or ‘34 -- ‘33, the firm that I was working for -- that’s the
beginning of another series of events which brings me to Japan, you see? They send me to
Japan in 1937, before the war.
Q: From?
A: China to Japan, to open an office there.
Q: With your family?
A: No, I wasn’t married yet.
Q: Okay.
A: No, wait a minute, 1936 they send me, I was married next year. ‘36 -- beginning of 1936,
I went to Japan. I got married later in 1936, came back to Shanghai, married and took my
wife to -- with me to Japan. The reason why the-they wanted to open an office in Japan -- it
was a different Japan in those days, they started copying the British and the French textiles.
They used to get samples from overseas and copy them in the Japanese factories and prices
were much cheaper, so they said, “We want to import from Japan. Go to Japan, open an
office.” I was only what wa -- what was it, ‘36? 19 - 13 - 23 years old. I opened an office, I
decided I have to learn Japanese because I’m dealing with the Japanese. I used to get
samples, which I would bring to different manufacturers and they would copy it. Then I
would export this merchandise to China. And then that was -- that was that period, that was

‘36, then my -- my -- we corresponded with my girlfriend -- my -- my Rebecca and then she
said, “Well, it’s about time we got married.’ Whatever. So I came back to Shanghai, got
married, took her with me to Japan in 1936 and continued with my job. In 1937, after nine
months of marriage, my son was born. Now, my wife was a young girl, 19 - 20, she was
very concerned to give birth in Japan, she didn’t know the hospitals, Japanese doctors, she
was used to her mama, you know. And mama was in Shanghai. So she told me, “I’m going
to go back to Shanghai to give birth to our child.” I said, “Well, if that’s the way you feel,” I
wa -- she was afraid, I said, “Okay.” I send her to Japan and there our es -- our son is --
early in 1937, March 29th, was born. She was in Shanghai, I was in Japan. And that’s --
And that comes another very interesting cycle in my life. Always in ways, my life is cycles.
I was -- Because that brings me to -- to the Fuguclan. You know the book Fuguclan, you
read it, didn’t you? Oh, the story of the jap -- of the Jewish refugees in Japan, what I was
doing there. You know about that, don’t you? If not, there is an article here.
Q: I want you to -- to tell about it here.
A: Well, we’ll come back to this. I used to go to a small restaurant to eat over there, in
Kovay, in Japan, 1937. And I needly -- I knew mostly all the foreigners that live at that time
in Kovay, was a small city. Small, foreigner communities, some British, some American,
some Germans, etcetera, etcetera. And I knew by face and by acquaintance, mostly all of
them. I belong to the clubs, you know. So, I used to go to the small Japanese restaurant
called Kovay kitchen. And I was there, one day I see new faces. Never seen these people
before in my life, they are in Japan. It really was very rare that foreigners would come in

Q: Was there a Jewish community in Kovay?
A: A very small Jewish community which was established in 1939, two years later, Ill tell
you about this.

A: There was a synagogue wh-which I attended. I used to be quite religious.
Q: There was a synagogue when you came?

days, in Kovay. Jews from Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, North Africa, and a very few our
people, which we call Ashkenazi Jews. You know, some Russian -- mostly Russian Jews.
And we didn’t get organized -- we used to -- I used to go to their -- to the -- to the Sephardic
synagogue every Friday. They were organized better than we there, because we were -- very
few of us. Anyway, so, as I told you, I was in that -- in that restaurant and I saw three new
faces. I sat not far from them and as I was listening to their conversation, they were talking
among themselves Yiddish, which was a very rare thing. I got very surprised, and very
excited, I came up to them. I speak Yiddish, I talk to them and, “What do you doing here,

“Oh.” We’ll -- Became good friends. I was not -- not busy. We became very, very friendly

You know, in those days, this was not so simple. You couldn’t fly by planes, 30 days by
boat. It was -- It was a different wor-world. He says, “Look, I’m here already three days and

says, “One condition. I'll shake hands with you, cause you see, this a contract between me
and you.” I say, “Yes, what is the condition?” “Can you write Yiddish? All our
correspondence has to be in Yiddish, because we don’t know English, we don’t know
Russian, we don’t know Japanese, you don’t know Spanish. So there is only one way we

transit visas, started to come in. So, my good friend -- later, I was working for him in Japan,
Mr. Ponvy, he was there.
Q: You worked for Mr. Ponvy and the same company”?
A: Yes -- na -- at that time, no. I worked for Ponvy after the war. In ‘51, I came to -- back to
Tokyo, that’s another story. He was a very fine man, a leader, an organizer. And one day he
came to me on a Sunday. H-H-He needed a secretary in a Jewish community to -- of course,
he didn’t know any English correspondence where we thought our organization, he says
we're going to get organized.
Q: Where was he from?
A: He was born in Russia. His name was Ponivairski. In 1941, beginning before the war, he
emigrated to the United States and he changed his name from Ponivairski to Ponvi. Mr.
Ponvi -- Anatole was his first name -- was a wonderful man. A real leader, a real organizer
and I was his secretary. I mean, not paid of course, just in the community. He says, “We
have to organize the Jewish community.” There were about 20 our people, Russian speaking
Jews. We made a meeting, we got together, we organized. [indecipherable] organize, the
first thing to do, you have to rent a place -- a place of worship. That’s the first thing you do,
and have an office. We’ve got to organize. Ponvi, he organized every -- he was a wonderful
man. I think one day, on a Sunday, I remember, he was -- he came to my house with a
telegram in his hand in English. This was the first telegram signed by six names from
Lithuania -- from Kalmus, Lithuania. German sounding names. “We German Jews in
Kalmus, Lithuania need Japanese transit visas. We are on our way to Argentina. The consul

here told us --” the consul was this man, Sukihara, “told us that we can -- he -- he can give
us transit visas if Jewish community in Kobe will guarantee our stay here. Financial support,
political standing, etcetera, etcetera.” That was in 1940, be -- be -- middle ‘40. So, I went
with him into the police station. The -- We -- They were taking care of all our affairs. And
we told them, here is a telegram, we -- they said, “Will you guarantee?” “Yes, we guarantee,
we --” We had a stamp. We -- Already we’re organized, had a stamp. We guarantee. These
people came. After about two weeks or so, they came with Japanese transit visas, but they
had visas -- final visas to go to Argentina. I never met these people.
Q: Now, these would be signed by Sukihara?
A: Yes, this -- these were the first visas Sukihara signed. Then, the Polish situation started
when Poland, in 1939 was invaded by Russia from one side and by Germany from the other
side. Many Jews from Poland, many from Warsaw, Krakow and other cities escaped. They
were afraid of the Germans, they were afraid of the Polish and where could they go?
Lithuania. At that time, up north in Lithuania, Lithuania was an independent country. And
where you find Jewish community there who could -- who -- they knew that they would
take care of them. And they started smuggling themselves over from oc -- places occupied
by the Polish one side or by the German on the other side. And they went -- That was before
Germany attacked Poland -- Russia. They -- It escaped to Lithuania. And then they started
this Curacao visa story. You know the Curacao visas, on the strength of which, the Japanese
consul Sukihara was giving them transit visas, which we started getting telegrams, 10
people, 20 people, 100 people. Eventually we brought, with those visas, over 3,000 people.

Q: Now, before we go too far, I’m trying to weave in your own family life, alongside the
story of the community.
A: Well, my wife was -- we -- w-we -- when the Jewish committee was organized, of
course, I was busy. After office, I used to go there and there were telegrams, letters, we had
to -- I was the only one who could speak and write in English. There was correspondence,
with Jewish organizations all over, and people started to come from Poland. And they knew
-- especially the religious people -- there were about a thousand religious people, rabbis and
students, rabbinical students, organized in different groups. They would come for all their
problems. They would come to me, because I was the only one who could understand them.
Young as I was, they would come to me and I’Il tell you some other stories which are very, I
wouldn’t say comical, but interesting, because they had their own problems, in spite of the
fact they were refugees. Well, then our women, our wives, including my own Rebecca, got
organized and they started to help the refugees, they had children. Children used to get sick,
you had to take them to the hospitals, they spoke Japanese. So, they were helping them.
Also, they started collecting clothes. Some people came naked, nothing on them. They
started to collect clothes and give it to them and this was -- in -- in the evening. Then, when
we got organized, under Mr. Ponvi’s guidance and instructions, we got together and we
rented a home, which we came -- on the ground floor was a synagogue, on top was offices
and a kitchen. We hired some people, our women taught the Japanese chefs how to make
good food, etcetera. And we were going there almost every day, especially the women, to
play Mah Jong and to play cards and that was a social --

them to leave, they said they can’t go.” I said, “Tell them to come here to Japan, same way
the other refugees are coming. I will take care of them and we’ll work something out, but
get them out.” He says, “Look, I --” and he shows me letters he writes to them, was about
six weeks before he left. He says to his father, “I still insist and I want you to leave with
Mama and the two sisters, 15 - 16, and come here to Japan.” Well, so he -- His father writes
to him, “You -- I think you ha -- must have gone out of your mind. I should go to Japan, an
Orthodox Jew like me? What am I going to do there?” You know. I said, “Max, tell him, if
he decides to leave, let me know. I don’t know how, what we -- I will do, but I will -- we’re
bringing thousands of Polish Jews, we’ll bring them out somehow. And then wa -- I -- I

Germans.” He writes the father, his father a letter, he shows me the letter. He says, “If you
decide to leave, let Mr. Hanin know about it and then he will -- he will see his way to -- to

Kobe with my wife and my son. I was working for the Panamanian firm, I remember I told
you. When Panama declared war on Japan, the military came to my office, it was a
Panamanian, enemy firm. I was not -- I was a stateless immigrant without any documents,
without any citizenship. I had my permit to come to Japan because I was working there.
Every six months I had to renew it and it was no problem. My son, who was born in China,

safe, whatever merchandise I had there, whatever money, everything was arrested and I was
left with-without my payment, without money, without anything, because, you know, it was
-- it was running. And they said, “Look, you are not an enemy subject, but the firm you are
working for is enemy, so we have to -- to take these steps.” They put seals on the safe and
whatever. And they said, “You can do what you want.” And that was in December of 1942.
In February, things were getting very difficult. Food was hard to get. Everybody was
rationed, not only foreigners, Japanese also. And I remember so well there were rumors, fish
is going to be distributed. So I remember so -- twice, I got up at four in the morning, run to
get in line for the fish. By the time my turn came at seven o’clock, no more fish. It was a
hard time. My wife, my child, who was -- Israel was at that time, ‘37, three years old -- four
years old. So, I had family at that time in Shanghai, my father and my mother. My wife’s
mother and her sister and other family members were in Shanghai, so they wrote us letters
coy -- thing was more or less normal, it was just the beginning of the war, before Japan was
bombed and all that. And we decided we’re going to go. I decided I have nothing -- I have

Q: And where did you live?
A: We lived -- My sister’s -- My wife’s sister had a -- lived in a very large ho -- house. And
she just -- There was for her -- her husband, who was -- he was a French guy. And she had

market. You could get any merchandise from this guy -- this guy had this, you could sell it.
And this is how we made a living, buying, selling, and it was going on all right. Organized
life was pretty good, the Jewish community was pretty good and strong. We had our club,
we had our synagogues, we had our libraries, hospitals. It was okay. And then my s -- my
daughter -- my daughter Miriam was born in 1943, during the war. My wife said, “Let’s
have another baby.” I said, “No, it’s hard, war-time.” She wanted it. Okay, she was right. Of
course, sh-she is the apple of my eye now. She is looking after me, my daughter. The
women are always more attached to their fathers than th -- th-than the men are. My sons are
also good to me, I’m very grateful. Anyway, Miriam was born, we call her Mimi for short,
in 1943 and then the war was over. Then we were -- we just managed. There was no clothes,

20,000 Jews that escaped from Germany, Austria and Poland, came to Shanghai. They
could come there without any visas, they just would came -- be-before the war, including
the 3,000 Polish Jews that we saved, brought to Japan and then they came to Shanghai. And
they -- the Japanese, under the pressure from the Germans, decided to take all these stateless
Jewish Germ -- who came out in °37, and they put them in the ghetto. You heard about this?
In Shanghai ghetto? They didn’t take us, they only took those that came before -- after ‘37.

ready for the Holocaust you see, and --
Q: And why -- why do you think 1937? How did they choose that date?
A: Who? Why did what?
Q: How did they choose the date, 1937?
A: Who choose the date 1937? Oh, why the Japane -- because that’s -- that’s the date when -
- when the Japanese and the Germans signed their military alliance, number one, and
number two, many, many Germans, Jews and Austrians were allowed to come openly to
Shanghai. They came by boats and they came -- except those that came by Japan, that we
took care of, you see? And they put them into ghettos, from 1943.
Q: Okay. So we’re in *43 and you’re in Shanghai?
A: Shanghai.
Q: Okay.
A: And that --
Q: And that’s where you were when -- when the war ended?
A: I-In ‘45, when the war ended, we were in Shanghai, yes. And when the war was over, we
were, of course, happy and relieved because some American planes bombed Shanghai. Not
where we lived, but where the German Jews lived, in the honque Japanese areas. But that’s
where they ja -- I thing American military thought, or whatever it was, I don’t know the
reasons that they had some factories that were making materials for the war effort. Anyway,

bombs. That was one of those war stories. And 1945, the war was over, the Americans came
and I had in my mind all the time, China is a huge country. Now, there’s no more Japanese
occupation, it will open up and there’Il be a lot of business to be done. So, I knew where my
-- Max Becker and -- had an office in New York. I knew [indecipherable], and then five
years went by. And I said, “I’m going to write him a letter,” telling him possibilities of
doing business in Shanghai, and I suggest that we send this and this and this kind of
merchandise.
Q: You had not been working for a company all this time?
A: I was only for myself [inaudible] with my father and my father was in the -- 1n the -- in
textile retail business, he was selling people suitlinks for wearing -- woolen textiles. So, the
first American plane I remember, with American pilots came, about 30 of them. I don’t
remember -- they had a special name. They landed in Shanghai. We were so excited,
Americans are here. And the Japanese were surrendering. We would rather they surrender to
the Americans than to the Chinese, because we didn’t know what’s going to be with the
Chinese. Communists were fighting Hatsunists, you know. Was a ver -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s
another world. I wrote a letter to them 1-1n New York and I couldn’t mail it because there
was no communication. So I mi -- took my bicycle -- in those days, w-we all had bicycles
because cars were not -- expensive and not available. I pedaled to the hotel where I knew
the American flyers were and I came in there. There was a big sergeant,, I remember so
well. “Hello, Sergeant.” “Yes, sir. What can I do for you?” I said, “Look, here is a letter. I
have to mail it to New York. I can read it to you what I write there, because it’s in a foreign

because there is no -- no mail yet, no communication.” He says, “We are leaving tomorrow
for Honolulu. Pll mail it for you.” I said, “Sir, thank you, how much this is?” “I don’t want
any money.” Anyway, he took the letter, I was very grateful and then about three, four
weeks, I get a telegram from New York. Already communication started to -- excuse me --
and he says, “[indecipherable] we received your letter and don’t worry. We’re old friends
and we’ll send you the merchandise and you'll be all right. We’ll send you and I will give
you credit,” and etcetera, etcetera. Anyway, to make a long story short, from 1946 to 1948,
Max send me a lot of merchandise, open account. And business was fantastic. Was making
a lot of money. Then one day, he came to check out. Of course he was sending me a lot of
merchandise, I owed them a lot of money. Of course, I paid everything, everything was all
right, under control, I had papers. Well, he wanted to see what’s going on and I don’t blame
him, it was his money. He came, I met him and I don’t know if I said so -- if I said that in
the old tape, about his parents, what happened to them, did I say that? You recall?
Q: Th-They were killed.
A: They were killed by the Nazis.
Q: Yeah.
A: He -- He knew about it, he came, and that’s another story. Anyway, business was good
and he says -- we continued it with the business and he went back to Panama and I stayed in
Shanghai and everything was going fine until the rumors. First of all, the Americans left.

Marines, by the British army. They left. And we knew that the Chinese are fighting, the
Communists and the Nationalists. And we -- The newspapers, we got information that the
Communists were winning the war and they were advancing toward Shanghai. No, in 1948,
beginning of 1948, I was working and I was conta -- connected with one of the refugees that
we helped to come from -- I made quite a few friends 1n those that we helped, you see? And
somehow, they wanted to pay me back, I think. One guy asked me to work for him and they
didn’t offer me any money, of course. If they did, I wouldn’t have taken it. And one was -- I
was working for him, he couldn’t speak a word of English, but he was a very bright man.
And he says to me one day, “Things are getting worse and worse, you know, the ja -- the --
we hear the Communists are advancing. They’re already in Nanking, which is six hours
from Shanghai.” And they were all leaving. He comes to me and he says, “What about you?
Where are you going?” I said, “I don’t want to go anywhere, I like it here.” I was making
good money, I have a wonderful apartment, my wife, my -- my three children. He says,
“You are going to go to America.” I say, “What?” And, in my mind --
Q: Who said this to you?
A: One of the Polish refugees that I was helping him in doing his business, cause he didn’t
know any English, there was -- he says to me -- and he -- he says, “You are going to go to
America.” I sa -- I say, “I -- I -- I’m not going to go to America, I mean, I -- I don’t want to
go anywhere, I’m here.” He said, “You are going to go to America, we’re all leaving. This

this --
Q: What year was this?
A: ‘48.
Q: Okay.
A: He took me in the car to the American embassy, it was still operation -- before the
Communists occupied Shanghai and I got there application for a visa to go to America,
which I filled 1t up and gave it to them. Then, the Communists started advancing and we
were all talking, what shall we do? Business is finished, stopped. The Chinese are fighting
each other. What to do? 19 -- In May of 1948, the state of Israel was established and we
were, of course, very happy, we were celebrating and then everybody’s leaving. They were -

children.” I say, “Where are we going to --”

A: Oh, he was born in ‘48.
Q: In Shanghai?
A: In Shanghai. Yeah, in nine -- beginning of 1948. So -- And then our people got together
and they said, “We were going to -- the state of Israel 1s established, we’ ll -- let’s send a
telegram to the newly established government there, telling them that we would like to
emigrate to Israel, because nowhere else we can go.” We were stateless people, without any

of Mr. Yowell, he was a consul and they started registering us, organizing us, who wants to
go to Israel? So, we went the first. My wife, myself, we went, registered ourselves and about
800 of us got together and they send a ship after us, the Israeli government. It was a
Panamanian ship, under Panamanian flag. United Nations somehow got involved with the
state of Israel and the United States, I don’t know. Anyway --
Q: Remember the name of the ship?
A: Yes. Wooster Victory. And we’re going, packed everything. And the Communists are
still not in Shanghai, they came six months later. But things are terrible. Mobs of Chinese,
hungry, no business, and demonstrations, all kind of things. I said [indecipherable]
Q: Who was demonstrating?
A: Chinese people. They were poor, they had nothing to eat.
Q: Against?
A: Against themselves, against us, against foreigners, demonstrating. They were yelling in
Chinese, I don’t know what they were yelling. Someone’s -- Banks had to close. Everything
became very disorganized. There was -- Nobody’s in charge.
Q: Chaos.
A: Chaos. Nobody’s in charge. So, the Wooster Victory came and we were allowed to take
out anything we had. I remember packing the piano and the carpets and the --
Q: So, it was the United Nations that paid for the passage of everything?

was a nice ship, but one of those ellessgees that was -- became a -- that could carry people.
800 people it was.
Q: And the a -- the -- most of the people were of what nationality?
A: It was the -- About 90 percent were German and Austrian and Polish Jews. The rest were
us Russian Jews. And we -- we -- we went from that ship, the first ship.
Q: So you felt very lucky to have that?
A: We were very lucky just to get out, just to get out. Also, another thing I had in my mind,
I knew the relationship -- it was during McCarthy time, I think -- before McCarthy time, and
I was Russian born. I wasn’t kosher, as far as the American government was concerned,
because -- I also -- there was a time when I had a Soviet passport. I took out a Soviet pass --
because I had no papers, nothing, which I gave up when I came to Israel.
Q: You’re talking about the reason that maybe you didn’t get a visa to America?
A: I thought that if I stay back and become under Communist occupation, maybe at that
time there will be difficulties to get a visa to go to America, they will ask me why. Why did
you stay? Maybe you were sympathizing with them. In those days, it was a different way of
thinking. I say, “We are going.” So we came to Israel. It took us about 52 days in that ship,
Wooster Victory. We couldn’t go by Suez because there was war between Egypt and Israel.
We had to go to Singapore. From Singapore the ship went to South Africa, Cape Town,
West Africa, Dakar, Italy -- Italy, Marseilles, France. We were picked up by a Jewish ship
by the name of Negbar, Israeli ship came and picked us up in Italy.
Q: That’s Marseilles?

Italy. I forgot. They came after us, of course.
Q: From Israel?
A: From Israel, a ship, and --
Q: So they met your ship in --
A: They didn’t meet the ship. We came on -- on the -- on the -- the -- on that United Nations
ship, the Wooster Victory, to Italy. And we had to get off the ship and the Negbar was
already waiting for us. There was -- Somehow there was communication between people on
the ship and they were there. They’re waiting for us. And in general -- I think it was in
general. Anyhow, we came to Israel in 1949. Was it *49 or ‘48? I don’t remember. ‘49, I
think. End of ‘48.
Q: And may I ask you how you were treated as a refugee from China?
A: Where?
Q: In Israel.
A: They -- The -- That was the time where thousands of thousands of Jews were coming to
Israel from -- those people who were remnants of the -- of the camps in Europe.
Q: That’s [indecipherable].
A: Ships were coming full every day, were coming from all ar -- and it was -- 1t was a --
most -- now, the Israeli government that time, just green and new, young, they were treating
everybody the same way and they were just say -- they organized certain camps in tents by
the thousands. They would put people over there and I don’t know about the food, because I

didn’t want to go to the camps. I had enough money, I had small children. And we went to a
hotel, stayed in the hotel and then we went -- I had some friends there who were there 10
years ago, went from China to Israel as -- as a -- pioneers They met us, they were friends
[indecipherable] and the guys I went to school with. They helped us out and I had -- as I
said, I had the money. And stayed in a hotel and bought a condo in Haifa and was -- took
about three months that year it was built. And --
Q: So, you lived in a hotel for three months?
A: Yes.
Q: Mm.
A: Expensive, but had no choice. And one of my friends, he was a truck driver and he said,
“Look, I have a good idea. A lot of refugees are coming in from Europe, from Germany,
from Poland, fra -- those that remained alive and they need storage facilities, for they’re
bringing with them -- they stayed a year or two in -- back and they were buying furniture
and goods and machinery. And th-th-they’re coming in, they can’t put 1t into camps where
they -- where they had the -- the -- what do you call it? Tents. They have to take storage
somewhere to keep it and we will organize a storage company.” And trucking and storage, I
-- | liked the idea. He says, “I have a truck, you have the money, we’ll put it all together.”
And we rented a hou -- a -- a warehouse and we started working.
Q: Did you have a direct connection with Zionism at all?
A: Where?
Q: In Israel.

Q: I’m just asking a question.
A: No, no, you know, you come to Israel, you are a Jew, you are an Israeli, y-you don’t
have to become to any political, unless it comes to vote, you vote with this party or for that
party.
Q: You didn’t feel pressured to be one thing or another?
A: No, no, no, no. Nobody would -- pressured me, nobody.
Q: Uh-huh. You had a very different experience, I think, from -- from a lot of people, that’s
why I’m asking this from you [indecipherable]
A: I see. Here again, you know, it was interesting. My time when I was helping some of
these Polish immigrants, Jews from Poland, when they came via Japan, eventually, on my
rone road, they would -- somehow I would meet some of them and they never forgot how
kind we were too them, how good we were to them. And one of them is instrumental, I'll
tell you this story in a minute. I don’t know if I told this already. If I did, how I -- why did I

A: No, they didn’t help me, because I had the money and I had -- I needed contacts and --
and [indecipherable] by the way, when I came to Israel, the first thing I did, I went to the
American embassy. And I said, “I applied for a visa in 1948, would you please contact, and
--” No, before I left Shanghai, I went there and I said, “I’m leaving for Israel. Would you
please send my file to Tel Aviv, to Israel? They did. I came to Tel Aviv one day after we
came there. It was there, and they asked me, “Do you want to continue on your work on the
visa?” I said, “Yes.” We’ll let you know, and that was it. I didn’t see them any more, until
later. So --
Q: Before we leave Israel, I wanted to ask you -- I know you have a -- a strong sense and
had a strong sense of being Jewish?
A: Yes.
Q: But, how about the religious aspects of your faith? Did this contribute to a strong sense
of your belief, your faith? Your spiritual life?
A: It’s a good question. I wasn’t really very religious, I mean I was what you call my
heritage -- my -- growing up at home, in a Jewish home, big -- be -- my wife was a very for
-- come from a very, very assimilated Russian family. She didn’t know anything about
Judaism, very little. Kosher, forget about it, she was not interested and I was also not so
much -- course, I knew, my children had to have Bar Mitzvah and that I followed all the
way through, and -- but the big holidays, I used to take my wife, my children, we go to the
temple. But at home, you know, in America, when you think about Judaism, I’m sure that
you are aware of the fact that there are Orthodox Jews, Conservative Jews and Reform Jews.

In those days in Israel, there was no such a thing. There was Orthodox. And for me it was a
little strange, those people with the long beards and the -- I didn’t believe the -- I didn’t
believe I belonged to them, because I was -- I didn’t ever wear a hat and -- and I didn’t keep
kosher at home. I know my father would have been upset with me if he found out, but that
was my life, [indecipherable] busy. Anyway, in 19 -- we were working, we had that
warehouse and wa-was making -- making a living and until in 1951, after two years
working, “49, “50, ‘51.

A: Haifa. No, a condo -- in a condo. Things are not doing so well and I speak to my friend,
my -- my partner. I says to him, “We’ve got to do something, because we are not making
enough for a living. He says, “I tell you what we do, we have to go and buy a truck, another
truck. And we’ll hire a driver and things will be all right.” I was in charge of the warehouse,
he was in charge of the transportation, you see?
Q: Do you have any idea why, as you look back on it, why things were not going well? For
everyone, or just for your business?
A: It was beginning of a state that starts it to build itself up. And first of all, I didn’t know
the language too well to go and get a job, you see, if I wanted to. I didn’t know Israel --
Hebrew too well at that time. Why didn’t go well? The economic situation was not so very
good and people -- it was a different -- a different way of living in those days. Everything

was -- food was very strictly rationed. You have to be a professional man in order to get a
good job, an engineer, a doctor. I wasn’t -- I was a businessman. That’s why, I think. But, I
was still hoping that things will be all right. Now, in the meantime, we were living in Haifa.
In Tel Aviv -- I used to go there, about two hours by -- by car, once in awhile to visit with
my friends and so forth. And one of my friends, whom I helped him in Japan. Very int -- I
have to tell you this story, I don’t know if I told that, but it’s a very -- he’s responsible for
me [indecipherable] yesterday. His name was Yaglem.
Q: How”
A: Yaglem, a Polish Jew. When I was in charge -- when I was secretary of the Jewish
community in 1940 - ‘41, when the refugees would come in --
Q: In Kobe.
A: In Kobe. The Japanese police gave us strict instructions that refugees, they allow them to
come for two weeks, transit, but we extend it afterwards, their visas, that they were not to
have their documents with them in order not to allow them to travel if they wanted to go by
train to another city, see? In Japan. And so, I had to have -- in my office, in the community,
I had a big safe and all the documents, I -- we insisted when they come from the ship to
surrender them, I would register them and I was looking through them. One day I look,
Yaglem, Yaglem. We used to import merchandise from Poland from Yaglem when I was in
Shanghai. And there he is, the same Yaglem? I don’t know. I started to check, “Where is
Mr. Yaglem?” They said, “Oh, he’s -- he’s not on the -- this -- the community supervision,

he’s a well-to-do man, with his wife and children. They’re in a big hotel and they are there. I
say, “I’m going to go and see him.”
Q: This is Tel Aviv?
A: No, that was in Japan. When they came to Japan, where we brought them from Poland,
Lithuania, Poland, Japan, that was Yaglem among the refugees. Am I making myself clear?
When I saw the name Yaglem, he was a refugee from Poland in Japan. I went to see him in
a hotel. I came to the hotel, Oriental hotel, and there, I said, “Where is Mr. Yaglem?”
“There he is.” And I see it’s a man, well-dressed, his wife, children. I came up to him. I said
to him, “A-Are you Mr. Yaglem?” He says, “Yes.” I says, “When I was in Shanghai, we
used to go -- import goods from Yaglem.” “Oh,” he says, “that’s my factory. You imported
from me.” I said, “Yes.” “Oh, very good.” He started to cry. I said, “Mr. Yaglem, what’s the
matter? What are you crying?” He said, “I lost everything, they took my factory away, and -
-” T said, “But look, you’re here in a hotel. That means to say that you have means. You are
on your way somewhere, I don’t know where. You can tell me about it and if there’s
anything I can do to help you, with paperwork, with permits, just let me know. I’m the
secretary of the Jewish community, I can help you.” He s -- He’s -- We spoke and we
became very close and he says, “I need to extend my visas for 10 days.” I said, “Give me
your documents and I’|I take your documents.” And I went and I extended it for -- for a
whole month and I did very good. Anyway, I don’t know what happened. Then the war
came. I’m talking now about 1940 -- ‘41, you see, when I met Yaglem in Japan. Then, he
left. I understand he was in England during the war.

Beginning Tape Two, Side A
Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Leo Hanin, conducted by Ginger Miles on
January 22nd, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
A: Okay, now? So, when we came to Israel, in 1949, I found out that Yaglem, whom I last
saw in Japan in 1940 or ‘41, is also in Israel. I went to Tel Aviv -- it’s a small country, very
easy to find people, I found him. When he saw me, he didn’t know what to do with me.
“I’m here. I have a factory, a woolen factory. It’s already doing well.” He says, “If there is
anything you can do --”’ I said -- he says, “Look, you helped me.” I said, “Oh, it’s all right,
for -- don’t worry about it.” He says, “No, no, you’re here. If there is anything you can do,
you’re a refugee. I’m doing well, Pll help you.” I said, “Fine, fine, fine.” And every month
or so, I used to go to see him in Tel Aviv and we were good friends. He [indecipherable] his
family. Then one day I get a telephone call from him, from Tel Aviv to Haifa. He says,
“Leo?” “Yes?” He called me Leo. He says to me -- we spoke Russian -- he says to me, “Do
you have a partner by the name of so and so, Danny?” I said, “Yes.” I never told him about
it. He says, “Come [indecipherable] Tel Aviv, I have to talk to you about something very
serious.” I said, “What happened?” He calls me from Haifa to Tel Aviv. If he says, I am
going. I came. He says, “Look, I have bad news for you.” I said, “What’s the bad news?” He
said, “Did you people buy a truck just recently, you and your partner?” I said, “Yes, how do
you know?” “Well,” he says, “how much you pay for this truck?” I said so much and so
much. He says, “Your partner stole from you 600 pounds.” I say, “What are you talking
about?” He says, “How much did you pay for the truck?” I says, “3,600 pounds.” He says,

“Well,” he says, “I was in a cafe in Tel Aviv and I heard three people talking between
themselves and they mentioned your name. When they mentioned your name, I am there.” I
said, “Look, you’re talking about Mr. Hanin, he was in Japan, he helped me and the whole
story.” He says, “Yes, we heard about him, that he is a fine man and all that, but this partner
bought a truck from us for 3,000 pounds and he asks us to make the receipt for 3,600
pounds.” And 600 pounds, which was a lot of money. In those days I needed a hundred
pounds for a -- living a month for the whole family. He says, “Your partner is a thief. He
stole from you 600 pounds.” My heart went down. I’m new in this country, just started a
business, what am I going to do? And I went back home to Tel Aviv -- to Haifa, I told this
to my wife. “What shall we do?” I said, “I don’t know. I cannot work with him any more,
he’s a ga -- he’s a -- he’s a thief. A partner, a friend.” Anyhow, to make a long story short,
he was a smart guy. He found out that my face, he could read my face if something was
wrong. I didn’t want to talk about it, I didn’t know what to do, until finally he says, “You
must tell me what happened.” I said, “Danny, what are you asking me questions. How much
did you pay for the truck?” He says to me, “Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean?” I said, “You
stole from me 600 pounds. You’re a thief.” “How do you know?” And he ran away. I ran
after him. I said, “Don’t run. Come, we’ll work it out, we’ll talk it out and we’ll find a way.”
“No.” He came back, he says, “Don’t tell anybody that I did that. If you tell them that I s-s-
swindled you -- some of our friends, I am going to report you to the police, that you
changed some money on the black market.” Which I did. It was very strict in those days. I
changed, you know, I had to live, you know [indecipherable]. He says, “Ill put you in jail,”

and it was very strict. I says, “You’re not going to do that. You can’t do that, that’s
blackmail.” He says, “Pll put you in jail, then.” I got scared. I closed the office, I ran to an
attorney. I said, “What shall I do?” “Well,” he says, “you have any papers? You signed any
papers with this man, your partner?” I said, “No, we did it by sh-shaking hands, we are good
friends.” He says, “You’re a fool. You don’t do such things in -- in Israel. You have to come
to a lawyer, then you’re covered.” He says, “I’Il see what I can do.” And in about six
months after he ne-negotiated with him and we [indecipherable], I closed the office,
everything is finished, I’m go -- I go -- I ga -- I went and I got a job in the Israeli customs, I
was a customs brok -- customs agen -- not a agent, emp-employee in the office in
bookkeeping. Had nothing else to do. And the lawyer is advancing, talking to his lawyer
and fi-finishing. Finally, he says we have an offer. Calls me up and he says that, “I can
make a deal between you two. He keeps the truck, he gives me 600 pounds.” That was --
The trucks was worth 3,000 pounds. He’s stealing again. I said, “Finish, I don’t want to
have anything to do, my headache is -- pay him off, let htm pay me, whatever he’s do --
finish.” He says, “I do it.” And he gave me -- he signed six promissory notes, 100 pounds
each, to cover it all up. I went to the soo -- this -- this promissory notes went to the bank. I
had them discounted because I had to pay to the bank, I borrowed money for the truck.
Anyway, it’s -- it’s an involved story. I’m sorry I’m giving you so many details. I hope it’s
all right, no?
Q: Oh, it’s good.

the first bill, but I’m not going to pay any more.” I say, “What do you mean you don’t pay
any more? We made a deal, we finished with it -- a lawyer.” He says, “If you say one more
word, I’ll go to your boss and you’re working for the government now, and I will tell him
that you changed money on the black market and I'll put you in jail.” I got so mad, I was -- I
-- I told to the guard, “Take him out of here. I don’t want to see him any more.” And I don’t
know what am I going to do. In the meantime, already, I am working on a permit, exit
permit, because my friend Mr. Ponvi is in Japan in 1951. He heard that I’m having problems
in Israel. He send me a letter, he says, “If you want to come and work with me in Tokyo, [Il
have you any time. I'll send you a visa.” But I had to get an exit permit -- ‘51, my friend,
Mr. Ponvi, who has established a store in Tokyo, he came back from America in 1949, to
Japan, to Tokyo, as an American citizen already. He opened a big store on the main street in
Tokyo, Ginza. Only a few foreign firms, American, British, French, were allowed to import
goods in those days. Japanese were not allowed yet. It was before the peace treaty was
signed in 1955, I believe. MacArthur. And so he -- he needed someone to help him there

about six months while I go to Japan.” And they came back and they said come on down

Switzerland. She also wanted to take my -- our oldest son, who was at that time ‘37, ‘47, 16

the army. That was a rule in Israel. So she left to Switzerland with the two children. I went
to Japan to work for Mr. Ponvi and Israel stayed behind with my wife’s mother, she looked
after him until he had to go to the army, which he did. He was in the 56 year war. He
became an officer in the Israeli army. I came to Japan and there, working for Mr. Ponvi’s

that was during the Korean war -- who would come on R and R from Korea to Tokyo and
before they go to -- report to go home, they would huf -- we also had jewelry department
and silks and textiles. And they would come and buy jewelers and textiles and pay in
dollars. That was the only way that they were al -- they call is script in those days, do you

you did. I understand you did --” He wouldn’t talk to me. I pushed and I pressed, I was

A: Why he was giving those visas after he was instructed by the foreign office to stop
giving the visas. I don’t know if you read the book, it’s called, “In Search of Sukihara.” Try
and get it, it’s a very interesting story. Dr. Hela Levine made a complete research. He went
to Japan and he spoke to his children and he spoke to his widow and -- very interesting
story. And only one day, he finally, after I was pushing him -- he was really aloof. He was
never friendly with his own Japanese people. This a -- you know, the man was a diplomat.
The man spoke so many languages. The man -- I think what was in his mind -- he lost his
job.
Q: For what he did?
A: For what he did. Why did he do it? I wanted to find out. He told me once, I will never
forget this, he says, “It was the finger of God.” I say, “What do you mean?” “Well, I saved
those people because I had an inspiration I must save them.” I say, “What do you mean?” I
says -- “I -- I -- I don’t want to talk about it.” He never, never, never talked to me about. I
hope when they make the exhibition, I can give them some information which it might be of
interest, you know? Anyway, ‘51, I am in Japan, I went to the Japanese -- to the American
embassy in Japan, and said, “My file is in Tel Aviv, bring it over here, I’m now in Tel Aviv
-- 1-in Tokyo.” A few months later I’m getting a call, “Your file is here.” I went. And that
was about three years they were asking me questions. It was during McCarthy times.
Q: Who was asking you?
A: A lady in charge, Miss Pinard was his name. She was in charge of the visa section.

Q: Okay.
A: “Why -- How come y-yo-you speak Russian?” I said, “I was born there.” “Are you a
Communist?” I said, “No.” “Prove it to me.” You know, she was a -- well, she was doing
her job. And Miss Pinard was her name, very nice lady, but I understood, it was
[indecipherable] her job. “Come again, we’ll talk to you again.” And again and a -- and I’m
not in a hurry. I have a good job -- of course I -- my mind 1s, my son, my oldest son 1s in the
army in Israel and then if I stay in Japan with the younger children, having a har -- easy
time, I’m making good money, a good living. When he’s finished with the army, I want him
to go to college, I want him to study, and my children also. There’s nothing to do in Japan, I
have to go to America. Where else would I go to give my children an education?
Q: Did your family from Switzerland come back?
A: No, no, no. My wife was in Switzerland with the two younger children and then, after six
months or so, I brought them to Japan, to stay with me. I was working in Ponvi, she came
with the children. We had a very easy life, very good life, very comfortable life. And finally,
Miss Pinard, every month or so, a telephone call. “Mr. Hanin, I want to talk to you.”
“Okay.” “Are you a Communist?” “No,” I said, I -- then I got a little upset, I said, “Miss
Pinard, you know, if I were a Communist and if I want to go to the States, would I tell you
that I am a Communist? Let’s change places.” She says, “What do you mean?” I said, “I am
not a Communist. I tell you what Ill do. I'll swear on the Torah,” you know what a Torah 1s
-- “that ’'m not a Communist. Is that good enough for you?” She says, “Yes.” I said,

not in a hurry. I-I’m working, I’m still young. I -- I -- We’re doing all right, making good
money, putting it away. Finally, one day, after this interrogation, I came to a lunch -- we
used to get together, some of the boys, some business people, friends of mine, in a nice

long time.” He says to me, “What’s the matter with you, you are so upset?” I say, “Maury,
don’t talk to me.” He say, “Why?” I said, “You Americans, you make me sick.” He said,
“How can you talk to me like this? What’s the matter with you, are you crazy?” I said,
“Maury.” “Where do you come from?” he says to me. “I just came from the American
embassy.” “What were you doing in the American embassy?” I say, “I am applying -- I am
working on a b -- am -- on a visa to go to the United States, and this lady over there is
asking me so many questions. Am I a Communist and this and that.” He started to laugh. He
says, “Leo, don’t worry. Ill take care of everything. You need a good lawyer.” I say, “I

story. I say, “Maury, I don’t want to talk about it, I’m so upset, she’s asking me all these
questions every time.” I say, “Well, she’s doing her job, what can I say?” He says to me,
“Wait for me, I'll let you know.” Couple of months go by, he calls me up at home -- and he
used to come to my house for dinner sometimes, my wife -- we’re very good friends. Says,
“Tindecipherable]| will be in this little nightclub over there, American owned nightclub. You

let’s go.” We came there at 10 o’clock, he’s standing outside, 1n winter, waiting for us,
drunk. Takes us around, brings us in, it’s dark little bar. And there were people sitting there,
nobody’s in uniform. And he’s doing a lot of legal work for the American occupation, for
the military, that’s what I understood. “General So and so,” he says to a guy sitting there, “I
want you to meet my very good friend, Leo and Rebecca Hanin.” [indecipherable] They’re
all sitting there, nobody’s eating any food [indecipherable] party, it’s a nightclub. And
another general, say, “How do you do, General?” And Miss Pinard is there, the lady from
the embassy. He says, “Miss Pinard, I want you to meet my very good friend, Leo and
Rebecca Hanin.” “Hello, Miss Pinard.” She says, “Oh, I know him.” And he walks away

Sprung?” I said, “Miss Pinard, you never asked me about my friends, I have many friends.
All you were asking me is about -- you know what you were asking me.” I said, “By the
way, we are at a nightclub, we are at a party, let’s go and have a drink and talk about
anything else. I know you were doing your job, please don’t worry about it.” She was upset.

you know, some -- some of my friend were there. He says, “Go to Los Angeles, it’s a new
area, start a business importing and you know the importing, you have some money.” And I
listened to him, and thank God I did. Anyway, then my -- my mind is all the time, I have to

and then who knows. And in the meantime, he’s still in the army, he’s finishing up. I wrote
him a letter, he wrote some -- he got his permits. And, by the way, when I got my visa, I --
Miss Pinards, the lady in -- in Tokyo, I told her my son is still in Japan -- in Israel and I
don’t know if -- I mean, it was going to be difficult to get a visa. She says, “When -- When

Q: To do business.
A: And things were not doing so well, I just didn’t know how to do business in America. I --
It was a -- It wa -- It’s another world, you know, and about two years later, I had some
customers who used buy from me. They had a store on -- on Fifth Street an-and Broadway
in those days. I’m talking about 1961 - ‘62, a long time ago.
Q: In Los Angeles?
A: Los Angeles. I became good friend with them and they had a big store and on the Eighth
-- Eighth and Broadway. I went to see them and then I -- I got a -- things were no good. I
got a -- a-- a-- acall from a friend of mine in New York. He says, “Leo, I hear you’re
having problems in business. I don’t know if things -- I got a lot of friends.” I say, “Yes?”
“Would you like to go back to Japan and -- for a year? We have a special job for you.” I
say, “What kind of a job?” He says, “We have some customers that are here now. They’re
from South America, from Chile. They are survivors of the Holocaust, Polish Jews. They
don’t speak any language but Jewish and Spanish. You speak Jewish?” I said, “Yes.” “They
come, they want to buy goods to export to Chile, they live in Chile, in a place called Arika,”
which is on the border of Uruguay, I think. “Would you like to go there and work with
them?” I said, “How much you going to pay me?” We made a deal. And I told my wife, I
said, “Honey, I’ve go to go, that’s the only way we can continue.” She says, “Well, if you
have to go, go for a year.” And I went. And I worked with these guys and -- and wi --

Q: No, you lived again, again.
A: Again in ‘50. I lived in a hotel, that was in 1959 and 1960, two years. And then my mind
is working. In ‘61, I have to become an American citizen. Five years I have to live here. I
have to be in -- in America in ‘61 to get my citizenship, that’s what I want. And I made a
deal with my friends. I was working for a year in Tokyo with these people who were buying
merchandise for Chile, but in ‘61, I have to go back to get my citizenship. I want to be an
American citizen. They said, “Okay.” And one of my customers were two guys who had a
store on Eighth and Broadway and I was really friendly with them. I had some merchandise
left over, I came to see them, I said, “Fellows, I’m going to Japan and I have some
merchandise. I’ll leave it with you. When you sell it, pay my wife.” It was about 17,000
dollars worth of merchandise. They said, “Well, what -- what do you mean you’re going to
Japan?” I said, “Well, I got a job.” “Don’t go, we’ll open a store here, you’ll be -- you’ ll
[indecipherable] our partner.” I said, “No, no, no.” I already -- I had to go, m-my mind was
very -- was under terrible pressure. Anyway, I look around their store, I see Japanese
goods, Japanese goods, Japanese goods. In those days it was, you know, radios and tape
recorders. I said, “Where do you buy all this?” “Well, we buy this from the guy in San
Francisco and this from the guy in New York. This from the guy in Chicago.” I said, “Look,
I know in Japan where to buy all these things. I will save you a lot of money. I’Il buy it for
you.” And I looked at this guy, Al was his name and he looks at me and I don’t think he
trusts me. I’m telling him because I know what I’m going to do. He says, “Well --” I said,

condition?” “You come to Japan.”
End of Tape Two, Side A
Beginning Tape Two, Side B
Q: This is tape two, side B, Leo Hanin. Continue the story.
A: So he says, “I’m going -- You -- You want me to come to Japan?” I say, “Yeah, you can
save so much money, because you don’t have to buy from local importers. I’ll -- Pll show
you where to buy these goods. I know. I know Japan.” He says, “Well.” I said, “Don’t say
well, just come to Japan and leave everything to me.” And he came. And we started a
wonderful relationship which eventually wound up that I came back from Japan to America,
to get my citizenship, which I got and they offered me a job to work with them, these two
friends of mine here, Allen and Abe, which eventually developed to become a very large
company, Lloyd’s Electronics. I was one of the directors. For 25 years I worked for them.
My main job was developing -- I used to go to Japan, to Korea, to Taiwan, to Hong Kong,
cause I knew how to deal with these people. And also, I used to go to South America to
develop South American markets. Panama, South Africa, Venezuela, Chile and this was my
job fo-for 25 years.

Q: Yes.
A: Now, ask me direct questions.
Q: All I wanted to ask you, when you came to America, were you aware of any anti-
Semitism?
A: No, I don’t think so, no. I -- I wasn’t exposed to it and I wasn’t ever -- oh, I was -- I’m --
[ -- I’m a great reader, I read a lot of books and -- an-and television, watch television and
newspapers and I knew what was going on, but I personally did not experience any anti-
Semitism.
Q: And after the war, as you look back on -- on your relationships as a Jew with Japanese
and Japan, did you know when Japanese American were being held in camps in the United
States?
A: I -- [read about it when I came here, yes.
Q: And how did that make you feel? What did you think?
A: [| -- | -- I didn’t think it was right to put American citizens -- they were American
citizens, that’s what bothered me, to be put into special camps, because they were not a
Japanese, even though they were suspected of being spies and all whatever. But I felt
legally, they were not -- they had no right to do that to them.
Q: Mm-hm. Did you know that there was talk that Japanese were sympathetic to Nazism,
did you ever hear that?
A: When? Which -- In which period of time? Well, they were --

A: -- they were allies. The Japanese signed a -- a three [indecipherable] Japan, Italy and --
and Germany, they signed that -- what they called an axis arrangement, it was in 19 -- when
was it, I think in 1938 - ‘39. That was a military alliance signed by Japan and Germany.
Q: Oh, but that didn’t make you -- that didn’t bother you or you didn’t worry about their --
A: At that time, my thought was that this -- all this political and military arrangements were
against Russia. See Japan was always -- considered herself an enemy of Russian
communism. It was no idea it would become a Pearl Harbor situation. No, no, not -- not --
never enter -- came into my mind. I -- I know they admired the Americans, they liked the
Americans. They -- They -- They -- They emulated them and all that, but whatever they
were doing political, I think it was all against Russia. That was my opinion.
Q: Did you see Max Becker, once you got into the United States, again?
A: Yes, I saw him in -- in Venezuela many years later, when I was traveling on my business,
I went to see him in Caracas, Venezuela. He was there, married, with children. I don’t know
if I told you about this story.
Q: Yes, that -- that story was told.
A: That’s the time I saw --

emotional story.

A: For about four or five years, until my children started to tell me that it’s no good any
more to stay alone, cooking and washing and doing, in a big house. And besides, it has to do
also with finances. I didn’t -- I wasn’t a rich man, but if I sell this condominium, I would

them and I’m glad I did. We moved here, in Woodland Hills. I am living in a retirement
hotel. Not an old age home, a retirement hotel.
Q: Yeah, just [indecipherable]
A: Has about over a hundred people. Not a very interesting life, but at least I’m about five

of AIDS.
Q: Did your children marry Jewish?

a Catholic girl. She didn’t convert, he didn’t convert. Good, nice people.

Q: Mm-hm. So you have no strong feelings about that, one way or the other?
A: | -- I-- ’'m not very excitably happy about it. I would rather him married a Jewish girl,
but life 1s life.
Q: Tell me, why -- why do you think that’s important?
A: Why do I think that’s important?
Q: Mm-hm.
A: Let me read you something.
Q: All right.
A: It’s on my 85th birthday in -- in a magazine printed in Tel Aviv, in Israel. “Leo is a
devoted family man. Proud, justly so, of his children, grandchildren and great-
grandchildren. Throughout his life, Leo had been a committed Jew, a leader in the Jewish
community, a devoted friend of Israel, a generous person, a faithful friend. In a way, always
ready to respond to the needs of others.” I mean, 1-it’s not a matter of -- I was not -- I told
my -- my Eddie, my grandson that married a Catholic girl, a very nice girl, Michelle. And I
told my children, if it’s going to be a wedding in a -- in a -- in a church, if he’s going to
convert, this grandpa is not coming. “Why? Eddie will be bra -- ba -- heartbroken.” I said,
“Look, I cannot, just --” So they arranged, they had an interdenominational wedding and she
is a lovely girl and they live well together and that’s it. This is America, I understand. I am
not that old-fashioned to -- to -- to -- to be so, how shall I say, crazily -- I understand. My
mind is open.

Q: I wonder if your children understood what was happening in the Holocaust, since you
were not directly there. Did you tell them, or --
A: I -- You know, the first tape that I made in -- in the museum --
Q: 1990.
A: I played it to the children and to the grandchildren. There is another tape, which was
made by the Wiesenthal Holocaust Museum, here. I played that also. And the children
know. Th-They read, especially the grandchildren I’m talking about. They were brought up
in -- in -- not in a very Orthodox Jewish way, but you know, th-they know -- th-they know. I
don’t know if they’re as -- as committed as I would have liked them to be, but this is
America.
Q: And when you -- when you say, this is America, do you mean it’s a mixed bag, there’s
all sorts of religions?
A: We -- We -- No, I say -- That’s right, we have to be open minded, we have to understand
that America, and I’m not saying this because I’m [indecipherable]. To me, America, there’s
no other place in the world like America. And I think I understand many things that are
happening here good and bad. I’m not going to talk about what’s going to happen, what’s
happening today, it’s -- it’s -- has nothing to do with my life. But I understand all that and
sometimes it hurts. But sometimes I -- I have to say to myself, “Well, this is America.
Thank God the Jewish people in America have a good life.” There is some anti-Semitism
here, I know. Farrakhan 1s here and other things are happening, but no country in the world

has been so good, so open and so understanding, with all the other problems that America
has been and for this I am grateful.
Q: I wonder if you are a member of any Jewish organizations?
A: No.
Q: You’re very -- You’re considered a friend of Israel and --
Q: Well, yes, we have an organization here, a small organization called American Far
Eastern Society of Southern California. All ex-residents of China, la -- an-and already their
children got together here. There is an organization here, San Francisco, New York, Brazil,
Hong Kong, Japan. And the main purpose is to get together and to make some drives and
collect some money to help our older people who are destitute out in Israel. We send it to
them and New York sends it to them and -- and there is about 200 people in Israel, ex-
residents of China, Jewish people, who are completely out. They’re in old age homes and
they are supported by us. We have to help them.
Q: A question I’m asking everyone 1s, do you think that the founding of Israel has a
particular, special meaning for Holocaust survivors?
A: Yes, I think so. I think that -- of course, I didn’t speak to many Holocaust survivors. I
didn’t speak to them, but I read a lot about it, all these stories, “Schindler’s List” and all the
other movies, etcetera, etcetera. And I think that many Jews, survivors of Holocaust had
nowhere to go, only to Israel. No other country -- America accepted some, Australia
accepted some, but mostly they came to Israel. And where -- where would they have gone if
it wasn’t for the -- for -- for Israel? That’s the way I look at it.

Q: IL have a list of events that I’m also asking people that we interview in America. If you
will just mi -- look at it and I think that the thing that I heard you talk about the most was
the era of Joseph McCarthy.
A: Yes.
Q: And how it affected you, but I’m wondering if your experience as a Jew during this time,
was as strongly -- also, did you -- were you able to relate it to any of these events that
happened, mainly in America?
A: Japanese concentra -- Japanese -- Do we want me to go through all of them?
Q: Oh, just whatever you relate to, not -- not -- not all of them.
A: Well, we spoke about Japanese concentration camps, right?
Q: Yes.
A: The Cold War. The Cold War is -- was strictly war -- Cold War between American
democracy and Communism, which had to be resolved, there was always the danger of -- of
-- of war, only the na -- Russians were accumulating all these nuclears weapon -- nuclear
weapons, with which they -- America was for them an enemy. That was -- That’s the way I
looked at it. And when Soviet Russia became no more, | think -- I think it’s a good thing
that happened.
Q: In a -- In a -- I guess what I’m talking about is -- it -- were you -- were you directly
affected by any of these? If not, then --

A: The era of Joseph McCArthy and the Red scare. Well, the only thing I can -- I was never
told that it was because of Joseph McCarthy’s s-situation that my visa was delayed for so
long, but it was part of life, an ex-Russian, speaking Russian, must be a Communist. You
know, it was -- I think it was implanted in the -- in the heads of the -- of the United States
embassy employees, tha -- to -- to -- to cro -- to check it out, because Rosenberg’s -- at that
time the spies, the Jewish spies that were co -- there were two who were executed. It was a -
- it’s a difficult situation, whether this should have been or not, I cannot make my opinion,
because I am not -- first of all, I was not at that time an American citizen to really
understand what was going on.
Q: And as far as the Civil Rights movement, did you have any particular identity with --
A: When I was here?
Q: The way Blacks were treated in America?
A: Well, in -- in -- in Los Angeles and where we lived here, we didn’t see that much anti-
Black, what do you call it, attitudes. We saw it on television. We saw it -- what happening
the southern states and the marches that organized by Martin Luther King and th-the dogs
that were put on them and the people that couldn’t work, people -- Black people couldn’t
drink water and go to the bathroom and all that kind of thing. It -- It -- It -- It bothered me,
but I didn’t -- I don’t know the Black people too well, to really understand what’s -- what’s
going on. Cause I think the Blacks that are in the south are different than what they are here.
They’re here, they are more integrated, don’t you think so? It’s -- It’s a difficult problem.

American, but I am not, really. I co -- I couldn’t. I wasn’t born here, I didn’t grow up here,
and I sometimes listen to my children, to my grandchildren, the way they talk. I see they are
Americans. I am still -- who am I? I don’t know. Russian, Jewish, Japanese, Chinese, I don’t
know. My head is mixed up.
Q: How many languages do you -- did you once and do you now speak?
A: Five. I start with Russian, Yiddish, English, Hebrew, some Japanese and -- not fluent,
some Chinese, not fluent. And I picked up some German in school and when I was dealing
with the Polish refugees, I picked up some Polish.
Q: This is way back to something that you -- you said, which I’m very -- I think would be a
-- a curious -- an interesting thing to know. At the time, you couldn’t talk about the Black
Market, about the kind of activities --
A: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where, where?
Q: When your partner threatened you.
A: Yes, in Israel.
Q: It was in Israel.
A: Yes.
Q: Could you tell me, was that a typical kind of under the table business that was going on?
A: A -- A lot of people that came from abroad in those days, knew -- knew immigrants that
had dollars.
Q: American dollars?

A: Yes, American dollars, in -- in -- not in their pockets, cash, but in accounts. I’m talking
about Jews from China. They all -- We all had accounts in America, in New York, in the
States Bank, or National City Bank, whatever branches they had in China. And in those
days, if you changed the dollars at the official rate of Israeli exchange, you had to pay --
when we came, two dollars and 80 cents for one Israeli pound. Because Israeli pound at that
time, was equivalent to the British pound. Two dollars and 80 cents. Within six months, it
became a dollar for a dollar for a pound. In other words, if I change a thousand dollars, I
used to get -- at 280, let’s say, three -- 300 pounds, but then, if two months or three months
later, if I change a thousand dollars, I get a thousand pounds, which 1s a big difference. It
was a very, very difficult situation.
Q: And so how did you -- How was it considered Black Market, what you were --
A: Th-This 1s what we call Black Market. I mean, you had some people who had a lot of
local money, cha -- Israeli money and they wanted to transfer them into American money,
but they couldn’t do it officially, to go to the bank and buy dollars, it wasn’t allowed.
Today, you can. So, there was -- and we needed -- I needed pounds to -- to -- to -- to --
Israeli pounds to live on. So, if I would go and change a hundred dollars and get Israeli
pounds, I would give my check on -- on -- on -- on the -- on the bank, wherever I had my
account and he would give me the Israeli pounds, that was it.
Q: So --
A: I -- I -- I -- You want me to look through this?
Q: Yes, the -- the presidencies in particular, the different presidents --

A: The presidents? The presidents, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, fo -- ooh. Yes,
what is the question?
Q: Let’s talk about Truman.
A: Truman? Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about. We knew that Truman recognized, one of
the first ones. He was the second one. The first recognition was given to Israel by the
Russians. Then Truman recognized the state of Israel and promised to help. I mean, the
president of -- the first president of -- of Israel, Dr. Weissman, came here and do you know -
- did you ever see the picture he brought in the Torah, as a picture? Did you see that? No? It
was an interesting picture, I mean we appreciated that. Truman accepted it with thanks and
congratulated him. And you know what Weissman told him? He says President Truman --
that President Truman told him, “Congratulation Mr. President.” So President Weissman
says to him, “You see, there is a big difference Mr. President Truman.” “What’s the
difference?” He says, “You are a president of 200 and what -- how many million
Americans? 60 -- hundred million Americans. I am the president of a -- a million
presidents.” Everybody in Israel thinks he’s a president. That was Truman’s story.
Q: So Truman, you feel was -- was very supportive of the Jewish people?
A: Y-Y-You know that -- whether it was support the Jewish people, whether it was oil
interest, we don’t know.
Q: Uh-huh.
A: Whether it’s against Russia, I don’t know, it’s hard to say. American politics, sometimes
th-they -- they come connected -- interconnected to something else. I’m trying to learn all

this now, especially with -- through the Clinton story, to understand what’s going on. It’s --
It’s politics, it’s oil, it’s business. American business is business.
Q: And before we leave, I also wanted you to tell me about the documentary that you’re
going to be a part of.
A: Well, the Israeli -- a group of Israeli, I think they’re very religious people -- seems most
of the refugees that brough -- were brought from Japan, about 3,000 Jews, of them about a
thousand were rabbis and -- and -- and -- and Yeshiva -- you know what Yeshiva 1s? Ha --
You know, rabbinical schools -- were over a thousand of them.
Q: In Japan?
A: Yeah, among those 3,000 Jews that we saved. And I was involved very much with --
with their problems, they had so many different problems, so many unworthy, I mean to
discuss it, but they had to be solved. I don’t know if I ever told the story about Passover, no?
Huh? You heard -- You heard this story. Til today I remember it, so --
Q: It’s a wonderful story.
A: They are making now, the Israeli company, religious Jews are making a documentary
about this.
Q: Who is?
A: Some group of people who are owning -- owning a documentary film. And they -- they
send a group of people to Japan and to China, and before they went there, they talked to me
about it, because they knew that I was involved in the Jewish community. And they’re
going to make a documentary and I told them a few stories about this Passover and about

this thing. And, I don’t know if I ever told -- if I ever told this before, but anyway, a few
years ago, the Sony -- do you got a Sony here? No.
Q: This?
A: The other -- The other NHK, the Japanese film company called me up from Japan, was
about five years ago. And they said that they were making a documentary on Mr. Sukihara,
in Japan and they want to come to talk to me, would I talk to him? I say, “Yes,” Pll be glad
to talk to him. And they came with a young lady from Brooklyn, who spoke perfect
Japanese, was very interesting girl. And I told them I speak Japanese, but I would rather --
“You might ask me some question,” I said, “which I will not be able to explain myself so
well, because my language 1s a little narrow.” So they ask me a lot of questions, this, that
and the other. Finally, “Why do you think Mr. Sukihara did what he did, gave visas?” I said,
“You know something, I’m not a -- I’m a Jew, but I’m not a very Orthodox, very deeply
religious Jews. At -- “First of all,” I said, “I want you to get it off the camera, I don’t want to
tell you to be on the camera, what I’m going to tell you.” “All right.” I said, “You know
why he did it? He did it because God directed him to do it.” “Wh-Wh-What do you mean?”
I said, “You see, he saved over a thousand rabbis and -- and rabbinical students and by
doing that, the -- the Jewish story, the -- the -- the teaching of Torah, Jewish religion, Jewish
Orthodox religion, has not been lost. It’s beings taught all over the world because of these
people that remained alive. That’s why God did it.” “Ah, so.” Then they asked me a few
question, “What’s a Torah?” They didn’t know. So I have a five books of Moses in English,
I gave it to them for a few days, they read it. Came back, asked me some questions. And I

still believe that’s what happened. H-His -- Just recently I had a meeting with his son and a
lady. They -- They wrote a book, it’s called, “Visas for Life,” did you hear about that visa?
Q: Called what?
A: They’re going to make a be -- a documentary about Sukihara. There’s a book that was
written by Sukihara’s son and another lady, I forgot her name, Japanese lady, which is
called, “Visas for Life.” Very interesting book. And they invited me a couple of times
through some of the exhibitions they made in temples and other places, I would go. They
would introduce me and this and that, because I met their father when he was 11. Oh, the
questions they asked me, I was -- I was -- inside of me, I was laughing. You know, th-they -
- they’re -- they’re making money, they’re making a living out of him, God bl -- help them,
I mean, I don’t care, it’s none of my business. “Do you think,” he asked me, Sukihara, “my
father was pro-American or pro-German?” You know, Sukihara was a spy and there 1s no ca
-- there is no -- there is no secret about it. He -- Well, you read this book, get this book. It’s
called, “In Search of Sukihara.”’
Q: What did your -- What did you answer [indecipherable] to his son?
A: I said, “I don’t think he was pro-German and I don’t think he was pro-American.” “What
do you mean?” I said, “He was pro-Japanese. He was doing what the j1 -- he want -- he
thought a good Japanese should do?” “Why?” “If your father was alive today, and I would
ask him this question and he would give me an answer, I’m sorry to tell you, I still wouldn’t
have believed him. There’s so many thing that are behind it, I cannot figure it out.” Why?
The Japanese people who were so -- in those days, who were so departmental. Orders are

orders, you know. There was no such a thing as argue against your bosses. His was the
foreign minister, what’s his name there -- forgot his name, the one who signed the -- the
treaty with -- with Hitler. Japanese foreign minister, anyway, his boss.
Q: Sukihara’s boss?
A: Sukihara’s boss told him not to issue any visas. I mean, they off -- the -- the -- the -- the
telegram came -- I’d like to -- how long you going to be here?
Q: Til Monday.
A: I'd like you to read this book, I’m [indecipherable] lend it to you. Can I deliver it
somewhere? I think where [interruption] -- that’s all right.
Q: Id just like to know before we finish, if there anything else about those years of your
experience that you’d like to say?
A: I like to say this, that my -- my participation, whatever I did, was minuscule, 1t wasn’t
very -- that very important. I-I-I-It played a certain part, but not in a very large scale. I say to
this, I was in the right place at the right time and I did to my opinion, was the right thing
what I did. I didn’t know at that time that the Holocaust was coming. You know, ‘40 - “41,
we -- we didn’t know there was a Holocaust. We knew there was anti-Jewish situation in
Germany, but you didn’t know that there would be such a terrible thing like a Holocaust, six
million Jews killed in such a systematic way. It was un -- it [indecipherable] found out this
after the war, it was mindboggling. So if I did something to help to save these few thousand
Jews, thank God for that. That’s all I can say. The right place, the right time.
Q: Thank you.
