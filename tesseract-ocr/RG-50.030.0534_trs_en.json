Thank you for coming today. Would you introduce yourself, please?",
            "answer": "Okay. My name is Joyce Saltz Mizrachi, and I was born May 13\", 1941. We\u2019re not quite sure; my mother says I was born May 11\", but she wanted me to have my own birthday, so it became the 13\". My name was then given as Josefina(ph). Why, we don\u2019t know. I was \u2014 never was explained, except my mother did tell my father to tell them that my name was Judith. He did what he wanted, and I became Josefina(ph) for nine years of my life. I don\u2019t remember Rivesaltes. I was born in Rivesaltes, but I do not remember anything about it, of course. I know my mother left Rivesaltes, and I stayed. I was the excuse for her to leave, and she always told me that I\u2019m the one who saved them. The ta \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long I stayed \u2014 can you stop it?"

            "answer": "I don\u2019t know how long it took for her to get me back, but I know I must have been about one \u2014 one and a half? One? I\u2019m not sure. I have been trying to get information, but I haven\u2019t gotten anything so far. I do have a booklet that was given to my mother when they brought her \u2014 when they brought me to her, and it has the pictures of the women who \u2014 the nurses who took care of me, who were Swiss Red Cross nurses, and some pictures of different periods, which I still have. We \u2014 after ri \u2014 Rivesaltes, we went to Tres, and there I have very few memories. The first memory I have is not feeling well, not being able to speak, and my mother going back and forth. I think it\u2019s my mother. And there must have been a little mirror, because I remem \u2014 that\u2019s the only thing I remember, and I know I was very young. And then I do remember Tres. Not Tres, Marseilles. We went to Marseilles, it was the end of the war, and there were a lot of air raids, and we used to go to shelters. The one I remember particularly well was the time I locked myself in the room, and the air raids went on and my mother went hysterical and my father had to break open the door. I remember getting a good spanking for that later, and I remember we did go to the shelters. The shelters were very frightening, because they were very dark, to me at the time, they were dark and cold. And I always cried. So there was a gentleman that I remember that we always used to see. His wife was blind. That I still remember. And he taught me how to \u2014 taught me different songs. And This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joyce Mizrachi \u00b0 July 23, 2009 that, I guess, stopped my crying, which became a pain in the neck to everyone else. I remember that. And I remember the different things. I remember being very spoiled by a lot of very different people. And I never had what my sister and brother had. I never remember hunger, because I was never hungry. I was frightened because no matter how young you are, people\u2019s emotions do \u2014 do penetrate, and fear 1s very, very noticeable and affective. It affects you. So I was always frightened of that. I was always afraid of being taken away. The other thing I remember is that I guess it was \u2014 it was a big Catholic organization, and in France the nuns had very big headdresses. I don\u2019t know the order, but I remember we used to get hot chocolate there, or something like it. And my mother \u2014 I was so s \u2014 very afraid of my mother leaving me, and being very \u2014 screaming very badly. Those are the things I remember, being very frightened. So remember being in back of a woman, because Marseilles was a very, very rough city, at that time especially, because it was near the waterfront. And walking \u2014 and we were walking behind a couple, and she had her bag over her wrist, and somebody just cutting the bag off. And she stood there with just the strap, screaming, and we were not far behind. I don\u2019t know if my father was there, because he usually was very good at running after anybody who was \u2014 had to be caught. And that always, always stuck in my mind. There was a couple who wanted to adopt me, and my mother said, no way. It was a friend of This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

And she said, probably, I don\u2019t know who they were. I know my friend \u2014 friends of ours that still live in Brussels told Lucie about it when she was in Brussels. I don\u2019t know who it was, someday I\u2019 Il go, in the near future, because they\u2019re rather old, and I have to go and see what they know. Then I remember coming to Belgium after the war, going to school. Things were very tough in Belgium after the war. Work was very difficult. The anti-Semitism was horrible, very, very strong. I went to school in yeshiva, but because I was very rambunctious, not the greatest student, because I couldn\u2019t care less, and I didn\u2019t like it. There was an orphanage nearby of all the kids that had lost their parents during the war, and they were sent to France and from France they were going to be sent to Israel, eventually, or some other place, or stay in France. And that made me very frightened. And ultimately my mother was asked to find another school for me, because I was such a wonderful child. They were thrilled to see me go, and I was thrilled to get out. And the next school I went to was an all-girls school. It was not a Hebrew school, it was very \u2014 it was mixed. Very few Jews, and I was one of them. And the antisis \u2014 anti-Semitism was very much felt when I was told, it\u2019s a shame that they didn\u2019t get you too. And I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, because my parents never spoke about it, not in front of me. My father never spoke This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

So he never spoke about anything. But I never understood what she was talking about. It was \u2014 1t was tough. Then we came and what we did for entertainment was we went to the movies. And I decided that, since I entertained everybody anyway \u2014 I used to put on accents \u2014 I had to do that, I felt, because everybody was always so grouchy, and that made them laugh. So I entertained. And coming to this country meant that I wanted to know where Hollywood was. I was nine on the boat, and it was \u2014 I was thrilled. I was thrilled to come, til I came and I didn\u2019t particularly care for it. I was very homesick, I missed my friends. My parents did not talk about their experience when I was young in front of me. It was all kept very quietly. We came to this country, and my father, who did not want to come, only wanted to go to Israel. My mother refused. She said that she was not going to have us taken away any more, and he had a choice. He either could come \u2014 because she had one sister left, that lived here \u2014 he had a choice; either he came with us, and she was going and she was taking us, or th \u2014 he could go and he\u2019d never see us again. So she blackmailed him into coming, which wasn\u2019t really the best thing for him, because he could never adjust very well to this country. She loved it. And every day I thank her. She did speak about it, ultimately, but he never, ever, ever spoke about it. I never knew he was in the resistance. I never knew that he had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I never knew all these things. Everything about him was a mystery, yet he was a wonderful father. He was wonderful when we were little, because he managed to play with us like a child, and have the most wonderful stories for us. She \u2014 my mother was very depressed for most of the time that I remember when I was sma \u2014 young. I remember her crying a lot. I remember her when her niece\u2019s birthday and her nephews, or whoever, always having \u2014 we didn\u2019t have very much money, but she always managed to get flowers next to their picture. And I always think \u2014 I always thought, I don\u2019t get flowers on my birthday, or anything like that. Why do they\u201d? I always had a feeling \u2014 well, it\u2019s my own insecurity, but I was always afraid that she was not my mother, because I used to think, if you \u2014 she got me out when I was one or two, how did she know it was me? Who told her it was me? Children change. How did she know? We stayed at the HIAS when we came, and that was really a shelter. It was a lot of different people from a lot of different places, and it was very much like a shelter, today, I would imagine. There were cots. And my aunt felt that that really wasn\u2019t proper for me, and I stayed with her. And I was \u2014 as I said, I was always very \u2014 my sister and brother do not want to think that I experienced anything. If I say I remember something, they\u2019re very fast to either say, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

But I soon \u2014 and then we moved to Riverside Drive and I went to school. But there were always things lingering, there was always this heaviness that I remember. When I went to school, high school, there were a lot of \u2014 which was Washington Heights, there were a lot of refugees there, and it\u2019s funny how you click. And that\u2019s what you do. Even later on you do. And the frightening thing was, one of my friends found out when she was 16 that that was not her parents, they were aunt and uncle. She was put up as a child. And that reinforced my feeling that, oh I\u2014 I know she\u2019s not my mother. And I remember thinking \u2014 and I know, because I was such a difficult child. I was difficult also because she was 43 when she had me. I was not exactly what you call a planned child. And I remember thinking, yeah, if I\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\u2019m gonna have somebody like you. Til much later in life that I realized she is my mother because I look just like her. But that could be with adopted child as well. I am ju \u2014 I am very This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

Not that it would matter anyway, after a certain age. As a mother she was a fantastic mother. She let me live and be who I am, which is more than I can say for a lot of children of \u2014 who are survive \u2014 children of survivors. Because they burden \u2014 there is a burden on you. There is a\u2014 a very heavy burden on you that you have to protect, even when it comes to your siblings, and you cannot do certain things that would upset them too much, because they were upset enough. But all in all they were \u2014 she really did a phenomenal job. She is the reason why we\u2019re alive. She is the one who masterminded everything. But a lot of it was also a lot of luck, because she was stopped by Gestapo, and she was \u2014 and he looked at her and he said, I will let you go this time, but if I catch you again, you will not survive. So things like that did happen. She did not \u2014 one thing she did teach me, was not to dislike anybody for anything that happened before. And that I\u2019m thrilled about, because I do have friends that are everything different. As I said, she didn\u2019t put all the ugliness on me, but unfortunately we do that ourselves. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m very careful who I speak to about it. I don\u2019t watch any movies with anyone around me, that pertain to the Holocaust. And you get your own things that you have to live through and work through, but I didn\u2019t have the hardship that they had. For that, I\u2019m lucky too. Okay. And that\u2019s my story.

But when I \u2014 as soon as I made a little money, I went to tech \u2014 I went \u2014 decided to try to do acting, cause I did it all along. So I went to \u2014 had a wonderful technique teacher, Anthony Menino, have you ever heard of him? Anthony Menino? And then I went to Herbert Berghof studios, and I studied with Bill Hickey(ph). And I did plays. I did different things, nothing major. Then I got married and for some reason I thought that if I had children I had to be with them, which was stupid. But I also didn\u2019t have the need that I had before. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t pursue it more, but there were obstacles when I did. My brother, I remember telling my father, you have to do something. She can\u2019t go to acting school. You know what\u2019s in acting schools, they\u2019re all sick. And a few other things. And my father smiled and let him talk and he says, you do what you want. And I did, and it was wonderful, I loved it. I really enjoyed it.

Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Joyce Mizrachi \" July 23, 2009 again, and I just \u2014 I\u2019ve done small things, but nothing like I really wanted to do. That\u2019s my fault, no one stopped me except me. But I found that it\u2019s a great thing to do, especially when I was little, because it really made life so much more bearable. I used to go to the movies, watch what they did and I copied the whole thing. The only thing that I remember that really I\u2019m thrilled about, when my father was in the hospital, when he was \u2014 had Alzheimer\u2019s, and he was pretty bad, I said, do you know who I am? And he said yes \u2014 and this didn\u2019t happen very often \u2014 you\u2019re my child. I remember how you \u2014 and I \u2014 I remember all the accents you used to do. And one of them was the Hungarian accent, and of course we spoke Yiddish. So it was an imitation of the Hungarian Jewish neighbor, and he found it very funny. And strange, when he was very ill, different things did come out, like sleeping with his shoes, because he\u2019d have to run and hide, used to tell us to hide. But that was \u2014 you know, with every hardship and with every horrible thing, there is some good, and there is some nice things that you can remember. For the longest time I couldn\u2019t think of my father because I didn\u2019t want to think of him that way. Took a long time, and now I can think of it, and I can think of the nicer parts. For someone who did so much good, sad to think that that had to happen. But, you know, we\u2019re not privileged. The only way I found out about his family was that we found a cousin in California who was really \u2014 who\u2019s like my third cousin or second cousin. And she This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

I had no idea about them. I had no idea about anything. I found out that my great-grandmother had a school for girls and taught them how to read, in a ghetto structure. But I never knew all these things. I never knew anything. It\u2019s almost like being adopted, when you don\u2019t know who your grandparents are really. You don\u2019t know \u2014 you don\u2019t have any aunts and uncles, you don\u2019t have any cousins. There\u2019s no one there. The reason we\u2019re So close is because that\u2019s it, that was what we had. That\u2019s who we had to rely on, that was it. There was no one else. And then we came to this country and I had an aunt, and she had \u2014 but her children were much older than \u2014 because she was my mother\u2019s oldest sister. And she decided that we were too European, she really didn\u2019t want too much of us. She was a little mentally deranged. And we didn\u2019t see her that much. So there was never anyone until I got married, and I did marry into a very large family, and I found that very, very comforting, because my children always had cousins and friends and \u2014 and the whole thing. And it was lovely."
