So I had to start school in a village called St. Veit. That\u2019s spelled capital S-T and then capital V-E-I-T. And that I started first grade to probably third grade maybe, fourth grade. I don\u2019t quite recall. And we walked and it was about maybe from half a mile to a mile. And then I transferred to the other town that I mentioned, Traisen which had a school that went to seventh grade or I don\u2019t recall. But I went there with my cousin Lily who lived in Traisen. And they had more Jews there, not many but a couple of families. So I went to Traisen until I was 11 years old. And then I was sent to Vienna, to the gymnasium which 1s like our high schools but a lot tougher. Very tough. I had to pass an entrance exam to get in. and I was very tempted to cheat but not for the good, but for, so I didn\u2019t have to go. But I passed it and I lived with friends of my parents. In Vienna. I really didn\u2019t want to go. I was kind of a home body. And these people I lived with were very nice. They were not Jewish. They had a daughter, a little bit older than myself. And we both went to that gymnasium."

Anyway my foster mom said when things started to calm down, it was time to go to school or whatever it was I went back to school. Had to go to school. And things went on sort of normally. One week passed by. The principal came into the classroom and said all Jewish girls out into the hall. And at least I knew enough I was Jewish, you know. I went out into the hall and there were other Jewish girls already out there. And the principal said pack up your books and whatever belongs to you and get out. Do not come back. No Jews allowed. So the comprehension wasn\u2019t there yet, you know. What? What\u2019s going on? So I took my books and my coat and whatever we had and I took the streetcar and I went home to the foster parents. And she said what, are you all right? What\u2019s happening? I said I\u2019m ok but I got kicked out of school. She said what did you do? I said I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m proceeding to tell her, the principal said don\u2019t come back. They don\u2019t want Jews. And she, I remember this like it was yesterday. She sat in the chair and she said oh my god. I guess we have to call your parents. And she immediately went and called my parents. And it was either my mother or my father. I don\u2019t recall said I guess we\u2019ll come and get her. So I was there another day and they came immediately and brought me home. And you know what I thought. I thought you know what. This isn\u2019t so bad. I hate this place anyway you know.

So that wasn\u2019t so bad because my cousin Lily, my age, we were like sisters. And she had two brothers, Oscar older and https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 12 Otto younger.

Isadore was my mother\u2019s brother. And so things were not too bad. This is now April already. Took a while to get me in and you know the details of all this stuff."

A very nice teacher came in one morning to the classroom and all the kids jumped up Heil Hitler with the arms. That was the law. And Lily and I jumped up too. We thought it has to be this way. And the teacher said Trudy and Lily, you say good morning. You do not say Heil Hitler or he said you don\u2019t have to say. So we thought ok, Guten Morgen. We never saw the teacher again. It was the last time. He just disappeared. Never knew what happened. I would think some of the kids went home, told mommy and daddy \u2014 unh. Away. Ok life goes on. About a month later, another teacher said to the class. He was our math teacher. His name was Richter. I remember that. Well I guess you'll see why I remember it. He said I have good news for you children. We are going on a field trip to Linz. Big city in Austria. So I\u2019m handing out the forms and you get your parents to sign it and Lily and I were it\u2019s great. So we went home and showed it to Papa and he said I guess it\u2019s ok. He had a little thinking but I thought well that\u2019s Papa. He worries about everything. And Lily went home and she got permission. And we brought the forms back and the teacher takes the forms, looks at them, tears them up and says Lily and Trudy you cannot go. We do not take Jews. Then https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 13 this is now we cried. Why? What did we do? Now it\u2019s beginning to sink in. Something is with the Jews that they don\u2019t like. And he wasn\u2019t all nasty about it. He said I\u2019m so sorry. And that was it. We couldn\u2019t go. So now this is beginning to sink in what is happening."

They weren\u2019t allowed to play with us. So we spent time together and did what we could. We visited each other. We couldn\u2019t go to many places. You\u2019re not allowed to do anything.

And we\u2019re in school and we went, as I said, home to lunch every day to Tante Olga, Lily\u2019s mom. And we\u2019re going to lunch and it is very cold. And we\u2019re getting there and the door is open and a window is open. Sometimes she used to open a window to air it out but always close it and all that. And we walked in and Lily calls mama. No answer. Again we\u2019re running through the house, mama, mama. Nobody there. And I\u2019m yelling Tante Olga where are you. We are home for lunch. We only have half an hour. No answer. Lily and I look at each other. Something\u2019s not right. I said what do we do? She said I know the Tikler family here in town, another Jewish family. Why don\u2019t we go there? Something\u2019s happened. So ok we started going down the street, when all of a sudden across from us, we\u2019re walking straight and perpendicular comes what we call the green Henry. It was a green police wagon. And in it is her father. And we see this and my uncle just waved goodby. And then we just were so scared. And we started running and we get to the Tikler house and they\u2019re all women, no men gathered in that house. And we said to my aunt, and she said what happened. How come we didn\u2019t know where we were, where you were. She said I didn\u2019t have time. They came and chased me out. And they wouldn\u2019t even let me leave a note or go get you so what is going on. Well nobody told us anything. The women were there and they were all very upset. An old woman who was uh, and babies. I mean there must have been ten or 12 people. Where\u2019s my mother? We don\u2019t know. So I said I\u2019m going home. Oh you can\u2019t go alone. So Lily said P\u2019ll go with you cause I will. You can\u2019t stop me now. Now I\u2019m getting independent. (laughs) So Lily and I start walking. And the distance was maybe a mile from where we were to my home. In Wiesenfeld. We get about half way. I see a bicyclist coming towards us. There was minimal traffic at that time. Nobody had a car, you know. It was, so here comes a bicycle rider. Even that was a big deal. Come closer. Who is it? My mother. She said papa is in jail. Where\u2019s Eric? He\u2019s in jail. Oh god. And uncle Isadore. We just saw him go by. They must have taken him to https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 15 jail. What happened? A Jewish kid, my mother is saying. Come on, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m going to take you back to the Tiklers. We\u2019re all going to be together. The story was and everybody has heard the story. A Jewish kid killed a Nazi official and we\u2019re ok. Everybody paid I don\u2019t know how many marks. Plus being in prison. So that\u2019s what that day was Kristal night. They took my father into a jail in some other town, and my brother and they were sitting there and my mother. They were taking my mother too. But my mother, if you want to know somebody feisty, she was, she said you\u2019re not keeping me. You can shoot me first. You\u2019re not keeping me here. I got to go get my daughter. She didn\u2019t do anything. She\u2019s 11 years old. What. And they said ok, go, go, go. So that\u2019s how she got out. So we went back to the house and all the women. Uh, what are we going to and kvetching and crying and my mother said. You know what. We don\u2019t have time for this. We better sit down here and think about what to do. So perhaps we could find, she just made things up to keep them busy, to get some clothes together. Or get whatever we need. Get some suitcases. Maybe do whatever we have to do, even if the suitcases are empty. Just, you never know what we have to do. And they said ok and they, I don\u2019t know what they did. But by that time things were coming towards supper time. And my mother said now maybe we could find something to eat. Could make a sandwich. Have some fruit. And so we all did that. They did that. And now it\u2019s getting later and later and now there 1s a banging on the door. Must have been eight, nine o\u2019clock at night. Open. Open up. It\u2019s the Gestapo. So everybody is cowering. My mom close to the door and she said yes. And he said how many of you are there. And my mother said I don\u2019t know. And get out. So my mother said what do you mean get out. You get out in the street all of you. Now. You can grab what you can and go and so people who had been futzing around and looking for clothes. They had stuff and they had a coat and whatever we had. And we were on the street now. It\u2019s cold. Quite cold. My mother says what are you going to do with us? We decided. There were three of them. You are going into that factory that\u2019s a few streets, I don\u2019t recall where exactly. Was an empty factory. And they were going to put us in there and we were to stay there. And this was a cement floor and nothing else. So we get there and all of a sudden, my mother stops and she said to them, excuse me, sir. I want to a, tell you something. And he said yes, what do you want? She said when we were young and I lived in that house where Lily lives now, and my aunt. I used to live here and you used to come to the back door and ask for me and when I came out, you tried to kiss me. And he https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 16 said to her. Shut up. She said but you did. What if I spoke very loud and everybody would know that you, a Nazi officer, kissed a Jewish girl. And he said if you don\u2019t shut up, I\u2019m going to send you and the kid to Dachau. Meaning me. She said that\u2019s very good officer. You can send me and my kid but before you do, I\u2019m going to scream it all over this town that you tried to kiss a Jewish girl. He said what the hell do you want? She said all I want 1s to take these people instead of putting us into the factory, to my home in Wiesenfeld. I have a big house and we can stay there. And of course they argued. And they can\u2019t do that and who do you think you are. And she said ok, it\u2019s your choice but I can scream. And I thought he\u2019d shoot her right there. Go ahead, he says. Take them and go. I have to laugh at her. Cause she said but it\u2019s so cold. We can\u2019t just walk. We\u2019ve got this old lady and a baby. And he just he was getting crazy, this man. And the other officials heard him say what does she want? She can\u2019t walk. She says I want a truck and they said get her a damn truck. They got a truck. They loaded us on. They got us a driver and they got us a bodyguard with a machine gun or whatever. And they drove us to my parents\u2019 house. So she saved the day. Now it took some time to find out what happened to my aunts and uncles. And for my father to be released and in the meantime, while we were all mulling around in my big house, my mother sent a telegram to a cousin we had here in the United States. My cousin. It was my mother\u2019s niece who married an American physician. And this physician had gone to Vienna years before in the 20s, to study at the University of Vienna. And"

So they sent Eric an affidavit and to make a long story short, they let Eric out. And this was maybe December now. Kristal night was November. So December. And he was able to get a https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 17 visa and a passport to come to the United States and he came alone.

One woman was my mother\u2019s washerwoman. And she risked her life to come to do whatever she could do. She even brought bread. She thought we were starving. But before that I forgot to put this very important element in. Right after the Anschluss not much time passed when a Nazi officer came to my house. And I happened to be \u2014 it was a two story house. And downstairs was the kitchen and a dining room. My father\u2019s office, his business. Upstairs were bedrooms and a music room. And I had a baby grand piano. And an old fashioned bathroom. We did not have running water. We had a beautiful home but there was no running water yet. My mother wanted to institute that and hadn\u2019t gotten around to it and blah, blah, blah. So. This Nazi officer came to the door and said -- I was alone. Where\u2019s your mother. And I said she\u2019s upstairs. Take me. so I take him and I called her and I said, Mupik, somebody to see you. She comes out. He says to her, where\u2019s your piano. She said, show me. so she shows him. It will be taken within the hour. And my mother said, what? What do you mean, it\u2019ll be taken within the hour. He said don\u2019t you know yet, lady, that Jews are not allowed to have anything of value. And she is thinking that this 1s a joke. And he said now I\u2019m going to give you a chance. Make a decision. It\u2019s either you or the piano. They were going to take either the piano or they\u2019 Il take her. Now what do you do? Even when you are feisty. You can\u2019t stop that. So that was I forgot all about that. It was at the very beginning. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 18"

And we had to go buy our own groceries. And the house was no longer \u2014 he had to sign it over to the German regime. It wasn\u2019t Austria anymore. It was all German.

Dr. Mr. Wellisch, the president has been made aware of your situation and has directed me to tell you what to do and how you can get your parents out. And it had to be a farmer\u2019s visa because the United States had a quota, didn\u2019t let everybody in. But if you were, knew anything about agriculture, you had a chance. Luckily my father owned a farm. I\u2019ve got pictures over there. I can show you later. He owned the farm right in Wiesenfeld. It was a big farm. He owned it but he didn\u2019t run it. Somebody else who ran it, but papa was the kind of man who was well informed about everything. He owned the farm. He knew about farming. He knew about lumber and everything that he did, he was well informed about you know. So my brother was able to communicate to papa to apply for a farmer\u2019s visa. To make a long story short, he got it, but it took from January or February until the end of August for us to get out. We lived under the Hitler regime for a long, long time and things were getting harder and harder. But he did get the farmer\u2019s visa. And he was able to have enough money to have transportation for us to come to the United States and the ship we were on was called the https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 21 Volendam.

So he was one of them. But he made it. Now the sad part is that after we were here already, we were very concerned about the rest of the family. Especially and Lily, I was worried more about Lily. We were like sisters. And the edict more or less was that the Nazis were after the men and the young boys. And so my uncle and my, Lily\u2019s older brother were able to get out through some Jewish organization here. I don\u2019t remember which one. And they left Austria. They left Wiesenfeld where they were in my house. And came to the United States and my uncle thought he could get his wife and Lily and Otto out. And never made it.

(laughs) and we cried and she said my darling I don\u2019t think I'll ever see you again. And I never did. So we got on that train. When we get to the border the Gestapo comes on. Checking papers. Come to papa. Papers, passport, takes the papers, walks away and brings another officer and says there\u2019s something wrong here. Get off the train. Take the kid, take your wife. Get off. We had to get off. The train goes away. That was hell. They took my father into an office and they told my mother and me to sit and wait and we sit and we wait. And train after train is coming and going. Our train long gone. No Papa. Now what. I said to my mother I think we\u2019re going to die. And she pushed and she said we are not dying. I, if I have anything to do with these guys we (laughs). They could have killed her more than once. She had a mouth and I mean it was about three or four hours later when Papa came out. We can go. What happened? They did not believe that he knew anything about farming. Because he was a businessman. And they brought in a knowledgeable agricultural expert who grilled him for two hours about cows and milk and what have you. And Papa thank God, he knew the answers. He was well informed about everything. And they finally had to, well they didn\u2019t have to let him go but they let him go. So we got on the next train and went to Rotterdam. And they met the Jewish committees and even the Dutch people. They met every train coming from Germany. And they put us up in private homes, in hotels. Wherever there was room and we were put up. At first I think it was a hotel. We didn\u2019t stay long because the ship was leaving anyway but they treated us like royalty. They were so kind, the Dutch people. And when we did finally get on that ship it was of course, the Volendam, a Dutch ship, Dutch crew and they treated the immigrants beautifully. And I remember having to eat brick ice cream three times a day. They brought this ice cream. And to this day if you show me brick ice cream I will ugh. (laughs) And we got here \u2014"

Shot in the mass grave. And other people. Horrible stories that my family suffered like so many others. So anyway, this is interesting. We come on the Volendam, right. Took us I think almost two weeks because we found out later from the captain that the ocean was mined. And he was trying to figure out what the best \u2014 where would the Germans not put a mine. So that\u2019s why, luckily you know we avoided that. The Volendam went from New York to I believe Cuba with some refugees. Dropped them off. Went back. And that\u2019s all I ever knew. And after I was here and married already, my brother in law took us to a very fancy restaurant in New York. It was some kind of celebration and he took my husband and me and he and his wife and, and each table almost had their own waiter. It was a bit much. They come and put the napkin on your lap and the, and I\u2019m not you know, and this one waiter said, spoke with an accent. And he was very nice and very courteous and I said so where are you from. And he said I\u2019m from Holland and I said you know your people are wonderful. And he said oh madam, do you know anything about Holland? And I said well Pll just tell you briefly. We came from Austria through Germany. And your people helped us and he said oh yes. He said may I ask you what ship. And I said the Volendam. And he said oh, almost like Oh. I said are you ok? And he said at that time I was a crew member on the Volendam. And we had a trip to Cuba and on the way back we hit a mine and all my crew members died. I am one of the very few survivors.

Why I\u2019m here. And they were listening and very polite and very sweet and can I help you and all that. So the teacher said you don\u2019t have to do anything, to me. Just listen to the language.

And Eric said no I don\u2019t want to do it but right now I don\u2019t have much of a choice. And this man said did you know that about Johns Hopkins 1s giving out scholarships and Eric said so what? And this man said you are smart. You ought to try it. Again, the same thing. The way he spoke about Roosevelt. Oh he says, don\u2019t be ridiculous. To make a long story short, he applied and he got it. Got a scholarship to Hopkins. Came for an interview and the dean, whoever interviews, said we have these two scholarships, specifically for immigrants. So that\u2019s the good news. You are definitely in. You want to hear the bad news. And Eric thought oh God. You know I\u2019ve had enough bad news but what\u2019s the bad. He said you have to do it in three years, not four. And Eric said so what. That\u2019s not bad news. I can do that. So he said to him, if you think you can do it in three years, you\u2019re in. What would you like to study? And Eric said law. Man leans back. He said Eric, I don\u2019t think so. You have such an accent you ll never make it as a lawyer. Pick something else. So Eric said well ok, Pll be a chemist. That\u2019s what he became.

            "answer": "During the war was a cousin who made it, a cousin of my father who made it to Bolivia. That\u2019s another story, that\u2019s --. He, her husband, she was my father\u2019s cousin. And her husband was my mother\u2019s cousin so that\u2019s a little \u2014 Kristal night. His name was Richard. And he was taken away and sent to Dachau. And she was left alone with her baby. In Vienna. And the Nazis said to her, if you can get yourself out of here, I\u2019ll let him out and he can go with you. Let\u2019s get him out. And so she starts going from one embassy to another embassy. Ends up at the Bolivian embassy, gets permission and they really let him out. It\u2019s now a few days before departure and the kid gets scarlet fever and they can\u2019t go. So now you start this whole thing again. But she was smart. She said I might as well go to the Bolivian embassy and tell them what has happened. Maybe they\u2019ll \u2014 and they did. But it took time. You know everything takes time. In the meantime the Nazis come and take this and finally they\u2019re able to go by ship to Cochabamba https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 33 which is the second largest city in Bolivia. They get there. I don\u2019t know how long it took. Heinz, the little boy, who is now 76, still living in Vienna, whom I saw a few years ago, so they\u2019re on that ship and they\u2019re getting to Cochabamba and it\u2019s on the weekend. And Richard says I do not feel well. And all the immigrants are in that camp. That\u2019s where the refugees had to go to an immigration center. And they said oh that happens all the time because the altitude is very difficult on people. You'll be ok. Richard wasn\u2019t ok. He got worse, but there was no doctor available on the weekend. He had to wait until Monday and he\u2019s getting a fever and a lot of pain. Finally Monday comes. Richard can\u2019t talk anymore, he\u2019s in so much pain. The doctor says you have a burst appendix. We\u2019ve got to go quick. They get him to the hospital, put him on the table and he died. So she can\u2019t get out with the little boy. She didn\u2019t know what to do and that\u2019s where my father\u2019s communication began. At least to somebody. She had no idea what happened to any, any of the family. Until much later on we found out. Eric found out. My cousins, they were all in Theresienstadt, most of them. And Eric found her. This is my Aunt Elsa, the one who met me at the train station, said you don\u2019t have to, her daughter was in Theresienstadt, survived and but she was deathly ill. And Eric found her, found her in Vienna, after and saw how sick she was. She had TB. She had kidney disease. She had, you name it. And he arranged it for her to go to a sanatorium in Switzerland. Until she got well. So he was able to save her and her husband whom she met in Theresienstadt. He was a roofer. His name was Alexander Bernot. He was in Theresienstadt and he saw Anna scrounging around for some food and they got a little bit. He tried to help her. He was a roofer in Vienna. He did most of the roofs of the big, like St. Stephen\u2019s and he was \u2014 and so the Nazis used him to fix the roof here and there. They didn\u2019t care if the water dripped down on the inmates, but they wanted their roofs to be free from rainwater and all that. So he did that so he had a little access to more things. And then the rumor came that the war 1s coming to an end and Americans or British bombers are going to bomb. So the inmates said so now we\u2019re going to, we survived this. Now we\u2019re going to get killed by \u2014 he climbed up on the roof of the barracks, with red paint. And he painted red crosses on the roofs. If he had been caught he would have been dead. But the thing was that some of these roofs leaked and the red paint dripped on some of the prisoners. They had no way to get rid of it and some of the Nazis saw them and they thought they had some kind of terrible disease. They ran.

He hired a choral teacher and that choral teacher had never been married and she kind of flirted with him and he fell for her and they had an affair and it broke up my marriage. Kaput.

            "answer": "No. I don\u2019t think so. I had a good childhood before. But then it was over. It was over. Because of not just what was done to the whole world almost, but you dwell on the people you loved so much and suffered so much. And when I found out exactly what happened to them, it, you know everyone had a story of what happened. It just, no. I manage to enjoy my life. Because I think I have a lot of blessings now. I have my children and grandchildren and great - and friends here and you have to enjoy what you can. The sad part too is what happened to my brother. Excuse me. He had two sons. Wonderful guys and the younger one was 19 and he said to Eric, they lived in North Carolina. I have pain in my back. And he was an athlete, very athletic. So go to the doctor. X rays, couldn\u2019t find anything. Michael you got to stop for a while. Don\u2019t do any soccer or whatever he was doing. And it got better and then it came back and it got worse and it got worse and it got worse. And they finally discovered cancer of the muscle, called rhabodymo sarcoma. And they amputated. He went to New York to Sloan Kettering. They amputated his hip, all the way down. And six months later he\u2019s dead. Nineteen years old. So my brother has one son left, thank god. He\u2019s in Chicago. But Michael is dead. So that\u2019s when I get angry and I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t it enough he had to lose this child. https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 43 I went back to school after I took this national exam.

We had a reunion. I didn\u2019t recognize any \u2014 one I recognized and she had been corresponding. She is the one who set it up, but I didn\u2019t know the rest, except for this young man who\u2019s now 88, who lived across the street from us. And we were always together. We were in school and I always liked him you know. And he said we should meet again in Vienna as long as you were here. And well, the very first time, before the \u2014 I was going to the reunion but he left a message with my cousin, the one my brother rescued that I should call him. So I called and he\u2019s very, very not rigid but precise https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Trudy Schonberger January 16, 2014 44 you know. The timing. I would like to meet you for breakfast tomorrow at nine AM at such and such you know. So I said ok. He came with a dozen yellow roses, handsome as can be and that was the first time I\u2019ve seen him. He was a, an American POW, served in the German army and told me he had to join the Nazi party because they all did. Most of the men and women. But because he desperately wanted a university education. So he became what is equivalent here to the Secretary of our Interior. That\u2019s what he was in Austria. So that\u2019s nice."

They took away my education that I could have had. They took away my home. They took away life. Not my personal life, but life. Yeah. And I don\u2019t know how other people feel but I have no qualms about it. And if they paid me millions of dollars, they would not bring back Lily. Or Tante Elsa or Tante Olga or any of them. Uncle Ludwig, who was a jolly, jolly man. Always had a good sense of humor. Loved kids, never had any of his own. Was sent to Dachau. Came back a broken man. And one day he went downstairs. He never left his seat, didn\u2019t want to go anywhere, do anything and his brother my uncle Isadore was coming to visit him and all of a sudden he says to his wife, let\u2019s go meet him downstairs and she thought he\u2019s snapping out of it. Oh yeah. So he says to her. You wait at the front door and Ill go to the back door. Fine. Never saw him again. She\u2019s standing at the door. He\u2019s never coming. They found his coat on the edge, on the banks of the Danube. Now what, does it take a genius to figure out what, he just couldn\u2019t take it. What did they do to him? So should you not be angry? But you can\u2019t live it all the time, you know. It would make you do something to myself. I wouldn\u2019t be a good mother. I wouldn\u2019t be a good grandmother. You can\u2019t live that way.
